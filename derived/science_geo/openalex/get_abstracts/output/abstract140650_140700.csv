Two recently identified point mutations in α-synuclein are the only known genetic causes of PD, but their pathogenic mechanism is not understood.Here we show that both wild type and mutant α-synuclein form insoluble fibrillar aggregates with antiparallel β-sheet structure upon incubation at physiological temperature in vitro. Importantly, aggregate formation is accelerated by both PD-linked mutations. Under the experimental conditions, the lag time for the formation of precipitable aggregates is about 280 h for the wild type protein, 180 h for the A30P mutant, and only 100 h for the A53T mutant protein. These data suggest that the formation of α-synuclein aggregates could be a critical step in PD pathogenesis, which is accelerated by the PD-linked mutations.

Two dominant mutations, A53T and A30P, in α-synuclein cause familial early onset PD (1Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R.

The function of α-synuclein and the pathogenic mechanism of these mutations is unknown, but α-synuclein has been detected in Lewy bodies (3Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.Y. Trojanowski J.Q.

Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 52: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and we therefore hypothesized that the PD mutations would cause or enhance α-synuclein aggregation. Indeed, a very recent publication demonstrated in vitro fibrillization of A53T mutant but not A30P mutant or wild type α-synuclein (10Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate aggregation of all forms of α-synuclein. In a complete aggregation time course, we show that there is an aggregation continuum; although all forms of α-synuclein do aggregate, aggregation is accelerated for both mutants; A30P aggregates slightly faster than wild type, and A53T aggregates much faster. Because both mutant forms enhance the aggregation tendency observed in the wild type, we hypothesize that aggregation of α-synuclein may be important in all forms of PD.1RESULTSTo test the hypothesis that both PD mutations would cause or enhance aggregation of α-synuclein and that this effect would be detectable in vitro, we cloned human α-synuclein cDNA (11Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) and generated bacterial expression constructs for the wild type protein, the two PD-linked variants, and a form containing both PD mutations within the same molecule. After purification, all 4 proteins run indistinguishably as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 19 kDa, and no differences in electrophoretic behavior were observed on native and nondenaturing gels (data not shown). To address whether the wild type and the mutants differ in their conformation, we performed CD and FTIR spectroscopy on solutions of all four species. Fresh solutions of all four proteins showed the natively unfolded structure previously described for the wild type protein (14Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar), with identical near and far UV CD spectra (Fig.1). The FTIR spectra of these molecules were also indistinguishable and indicated that they contain primarily random coil structure. Thus, the initial conformation of the wild type α-synuclein and the mutants is identical.Because α-synuclein aggregation could be slow, we chose to analyze solutions of α-synuclein over several days at three different temperatures. During the time frame of the experiment no aggregates formed when incubated at 4 °C or room temperature (data not shown). After incubation for several days at 37 °C, all four proteins began to form insoluble aggregates that could be precipitated by ultracentrifugation. This aggregation proceeded until most of the material had fallen out of solution. This process could be further accelerated by continuously shaking the solution (data not shown). Importantly, in all experiments, aggregate formation was faster for the PD-linked mutations than for the wild type, and the A53T mutation had a more dramatic effect than the A30P mutation. This is most clearly seen when the data are converted into approximate lag times before precipitable aggregates are detected. The lag time for the wild type protein was about 280 h, that of the A30P mutant was about 180 h, and that of the A53T mutant was only about 100 h. An example of such an aggregation time course is shown in Fig.2. At 11 distinct time points we separated the soluble and insoluble material using ultracentrifugation. The secondary structure of the protein that remained soluble was analyzed by CD and did not change for any of the four proteins throughout the course of the experiment (data not shown). The structure of the protein that was in the pellet was analyzed by FTIR. As Fig.3 clearly shows, aggregation and precipitation of α-synuclein is accompanied by a dramatic change in secondary structure, from the initial primarily random coil seen when the α-synuclein is in solution structure (1650 cm−1band, Fig. 3, top panel) to the final antiparallel β-sheet structure present in the α-synuclein pellet (1629 cm−1, Fig. 3, bottom panel). This structure is commonly observed in protein aggregates. The spectra of the aggregate of all four forms are indistinguishable. To address whether the precipitates contain only amorphous aggregates or distinct fibrillar structures, we analyzed them by electron and atomic force microscopy (Fig.4). Fibrils of the wild type and mutant proteins were readily detected in the precipitates by electron microscopy with positive staining. The diameter of the fibrils is around 12 nm. Fluid phase atomic force microscopy clearly demonstrates the presence of fibrils in their native aqueous environment.Figure 2α-Synuclein mutations show accelerated aggregation.

The generation of such aggregates could be a critical step in the formation of Lewy bodies, which contain full-length α-synuclein as their major fibrillar component (6Spillantini G.M. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). Future studies will address in more detail the kinetics of α-synuclein aggregation and fibril morphology. The lag phase preceding α-synuclein fibril formation (Fig. 2) could be indicative of a nucleation-dependent polymerization, and the fact that stirring or shaking dramatically increases the aggregation rate is also supportive of such a mechanism (for review, see Ref. 15Jarrett J.T. Lansbury PT. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the α-synuclein mutants studied here all show a reduced lag phase with respect to wild type. Under our conditions the wild type lag phase is about 280 h, that of the A30P mutant is about 180 h, and that of the A53T mutant is about 100 h. The actual concentration of α-synuclein within cells forming Lewy bodies is unknown, but it is very likely to be much lower than in this experimental setup. However, it is not unreasonable to assume that in vivo, nuclei formation could be influenced by seeding cofactors, thus allowing α-synuclein to aggregate at lower concentrations than in our experiments. Furthermore, the formation of fibrils may take years in vivo but happens within weeks in our system. It will also be interesting to compare α-synuclein fibrils found in Lewy bodies (6Spillantini G.M. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar) with our synthetic α-synuclein fibrils in the same experimental set up.Most importantly, our results show that both point mutations causing familial PD enhance the aggregation tendency observed in the wild type protein. This is critical, because a pathogenesis model that can cover all known mutants plus the wild type situation is less likely to be based on non-disease-relevant effects. For example, in the Alzheimer's disease field, the key evidence for the amyloid hypothesis is the finding that all known early onset familial Alzheimer's disease mutations have one common effect: they increase Aβ42 production compared with the wild type (reviewed in Ref. 16Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Our finding that all forms of α-synuclein aggregate, but both mutants aggregate faster, immediately suggests that the aggregation is relevant for the pathogenesis of PD and may explain the early disease onset in these families. Although the concentrations used here are nonphysiological, the data show an effect that mirrors the biology in an assay that accomplishes aggregation of all forms of α-synuclein, including wild type. This is important, because most Lewy body diseases seem to involve aggregation of wild type α-synuclein.Our in vitro assay can be exploited for various applications. The observation that the two mutants enhance aggregation to different extents suggests that one could design additional mutations that would enhance β-sheet formation and further accelerate aggregation in vitro. As a first example, we tested the A53T/A30P double mutant; in some experiments this analog aggregated faster than each of the original mutants; however, this effect was not always observed. Very rapidly aggregating mutant α-synuclein could be critical in the generation of a transgenic model of Lewy body formation. It will be important to see whether such mice develop Parkinsonian symptoms. Finally, the system we have established here can be readily adapted to high throughput screening for compounds that block α-synuclein aggregation. Such inhibitors could be useful as PD therapeutics if aggregation of α-synuclein is a critical step in all forms of PD. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system but also several other regions of the brain.

Lansbury PT. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the α-synuclein mutants studied here all show a reduced lag phase with respect to wild type. Under our conditions the wild type lag phase is about 280 h, that of the A30P mutant is about 180 h, and that of the A53T mutant is about 100 h. The actual concentration of α-synuclein within cells forming Lewy bodies is unknown, but it is very likely to be much lower than in this experimental setup. However, it is not unreasonable to assume that in vivo, nuclei formation could be influenced by seeding cofactors, thus allowing α-synuclein to aggregate at lower concentrations than in our experiments. Furthermore, the formation of fibrils may take years in vivo but happens within weeks in our system. It will also be interesting to compare α-synuclein fibrils found in Lewy bodies (6Spillantini G.M. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar) with our synthetic α-synuclein fibrils in the same experimental set up. Most importantly, our results show that both point mutations causing familial PD enhance the aggregation tendency observed in the wild type protein. This is critical, because a pathogenesis model that can cover all known mutants plus the wild type situation is less likely to be based on non-disease-relevant effects. For example, in the Alzheimer's disease field, the key evidence for the amyloid hypothesis is the finding that all known early onset familial Alzheimer's disease mutations have one common effect: they increase Aβ42 production compared with the wild type (reviewed in Ref. 16Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Our finding that all forms of α-synuclein aggregate, but both mutants aggregate faster, immediately suggests that the aggregation is relevant for the pathogenesis of PD and may explain the early disease onset in these families. Although the concentrations used here are nonphysiological, the data show an effect that mirrors the biology in an assay that accomplishes aggregation of all forms of α-synuclein, including wild type. This is important, because most Lewy body diseases seem to involve aggregation of wild type α-synuclein. Our in vitro assay can be exploited for various applications. The observation that the two mutants enhance aggregation to different extents suggests that one could design additional mutations that would enhance β-sheet formation and further accelerate aggregation in vitro. As a first example, we tested the A53T/A30P double mutant; in some experiments this analog aggregated faster than each of the original mutants; however, this effect was not always observed. Very rapidly aggregating mutant α-synuclein could be critical in the generation of a transgenic model of Lewy body formation. It will be important to see whether such mice develop Parkinsonian symptoms. Finally, the system we have established here can be readily adapted to high throughput screening for compounds that block α-synuclein aggregation. Such inhibitors could be useful as PD therapeutics if aggregation of α-synuclein is a critical step in all forms of PD.

Several members of this gene family bind to fibrillar collagens and are believed to function in the assembly of the collagen network in connective tissues. Here we show that mice lacking a functional fibromodulin gene exhibit an altered morphological phenotype in tail tendon with fewer and abnormal collagen fiber bundles. In fibromodulin-null animals virtually all collagen fiber bundles are disorganized and have an abnormal morphology. Also 10–20% of the bundles in heterozygous mice are similar to the abnormal bundles in fibromodulin-null tail tendon. Ultrastructural analysis of Achilles tendon from fibromodulin-null mice show collagen fibrils with irregular and rough outlines in cross-section. Morphometric analysis show that fibromodulin-null mice have on the average thinner fibrils than wild type animals as a result of a larger preponderance of very thin fibrils in an overall similar range of fibril diameters. Protein and RNA analyses show an approximately 4-fold increase in the content of lumican in fibromodulin-null as compared with wild type tail tendon, despite a decrease in lumican mRNA. These results demonstrate a role for fibromodulin in collagen fibrillogenesis and suggest that the orchestrated action of several leucine-rich repeat glycoproteins/proteoglycans influence the architecture of collagen matrices.

Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The gene family includes about 10 known members and can be divided into subfamilies based on similarities in amino acid sequences and gene organization. One subfamily includes decorin (2Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and biglycan (3Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains an N-terminal domain substituted with chondroitin/dermatan-sulfate chains. These proteoglycans show 57% protein sequence identity and are encoded by genes composed of eight exons with exon/intron junctions in conserved positions (4Fisher L.W. Heegaard A.-M. Vetter U.

Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 15: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fibromodulin (6Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2601-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and lumican (7Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Brown S.J. Vergnes J.-P. Hassel J.R. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11874-11880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) constitute another subfamily and exhibit 48% protein sequence identity. Their genes are composed of three exons with conserved exon/intron junctions (8Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 204-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Grover J. Chen X.-N. Korenberg J.R. Roughley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21942-21949Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Other members of this subfamily are keratocan (10Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Bottomley G.S. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9759-9763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), PRELP (11Bengtsson E. Neame P.J. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25639-25644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and osteoadherin (12Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Chondroadherin represents its own family with a different organization of the gene and a different amino acid composition (13Neame P.J. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21547-21554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LRR extracellular matrix glycoproteins/proteoglycans have core proteins ranging in size between 32–42 kDa, which can be divided into three main structural domains, the N-terminal, C-terminal, and central domains. The N-terminal domains are least conserved, but all members of the gene family contain four Cys residues, which form intrachain disulfide bonds (14Neame P.J. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8653-8661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glycosaminoglycan chains in decorin and biglycan are O-glycosidically linked to Ser residues in the N-terminal region, providing pronounced polyanionic properties to the proteoglycans. In analogy, the N-terminal domains in fibromodulin (15Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16859-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and most likely also in lumican carry clusters of negatively charged Tyr sulfate residues. The C-terminal domains comprise some 50 amino acid residues and show considerable similarities among family members. This domain contains two Cys residues involved in an intrachain disulfide bond leading to the formation of a 34–41-residue loop. The common central domains constitute 60–80% of the total amino acids. In most of the members of the family, it is composed of a 10–11-fold repeat of a 20–25-residue long LRR with preferentially Asn and Leu residues in conserved positions. Such repeats are found in many intracellular proteins. Studies of one of these, i.e. the ribonuclease inhibitor, has provided important structural information. Thus its three-dimensional structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography (16Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). It was found that the LRRs form a horseshoe-shaped coil of parallel, alternating α-helices and β-sheets stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds. Presumably the extracellular matrix LRR glycoproteins/proteoglycans have a similar three-dimensional structure (17Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). There are consensus site Asn residues in the central repeat domain for substitution with carbohydrates. In fibromodulin four such sites appear to serve as acceptors for keratan sulfate (15Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16859-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in an individual molecule no more than two of the sites carry a keratan sulfate chain (18Plaas A.H.K. Neame P. Nivens C.M. Reiss L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20634-20640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In lumican equivalent positions can be substituted with carbohydrates. This substitution is also more variable, and lumican is present as a keratan sulfate proteoglycan primarily in the cornea, while being a classical glycoprotein, without the repeat sulfated disaccharides, in tissues such as skin and cartilage (9Grover J. Chen X.-N. Korenberg J.R. Roughley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21942-21949Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The glycosylation of fibromodulin and lumican is a process that appears to be tissue-specific, developmentally regulated (19Cornuet P.K. Blochberger T.C. Hassel J.R. Invest. Ophtalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar), and dependent on age (20Roughley P.J. White R.J. Cszabo G. Mort J.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1996; 4: 229-255Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Decorin (21Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), fibromodulin (22Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lumican (23Rada J.A. Cornuet P.K. Hassel J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) bind to fibrillar collagens in vitro, leading to delayed fibril formation and the formation of thinner fibrils (24Vogel K.G. Trotter J.A. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This is most likely caused by the binding of LRR glycoproteins/proteoglycans to the surface of the axially growing fibril (25Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), which inhibits the incorporation of additional triple helical collagen monomers. The binding of LRR glycoproteins/proteoglycans to collagen alters the surface properties of the fibrils and may affect the interactions between individual collagen fibrils as well as between fibrils and matrix constituents, other than LRR glycoproteins/proteoglycans. It has been proposed that competitive binding and displacement of proteoglycans regulate the growth of collagen fibrils during development (26Scott J. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of decorin to collagen is not inhibited by fibromodulin andvice versa, suggesting that these two members of the gene family bind to different sites on the collagen fibril (27Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrastructural analysis of collagen fibrils in tissues demonstrate that decorin (28Pringle G.A. Dodd C.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and fibromodulin (29Hedlund H. Mengarelli-Widholm S. Heinegård D. Reinholt F.P. Svensson O. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) bind to distinct and apparently separate sites in the gap region of the D-period of the collagen fibrilin vivo. The binding site for collagen in decorin has tentatively been localized to LRR 4–5 in the central domain (30Svensson L. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and recent results suggest a critical role for a Glu residue in this region for interaction with type I collagen (31Kresse H. Liszio C. Schönherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The interactions between collagens and LRR glycoproteins/proteoglycans appear to be crucial for the correct assembly of collagen fibrils and the generation of a functional collagen matrix scaffold in vivo. Mice lacking decorin have fragile skin with reduced tensile strength, a phenotype consistent with a malfunctioning collagen matrix (32Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural analysis of decorin-null mice revealed abnormal collagen fibrils in tissues such as skin and tendon, with more coarse and irregular collagen fiber outlines. Lumican-null mice show skin fragility and corneal opacity (33Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic investigations of lumican-null mice reveal a deregulated growth of collagen fibrils with a significant proportion of abnormally thick fibrils in skin and cornea. The recent evaluation of biglycan-deficient mice suggests a role for biglycan in bone homeostasis (34Xu T. et al.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We have generated fibromodulin-deficient mice to study a possible role for fibromodulin in the assembly of collagen matrices. Here we show that a null mutation in the fibromodulin gene leads to abnormal collagen fibrils in tendons. In addition, the absence of fibromodulin leads to an increase in lumican, which is associated with decreased lumican mRNA levels. A bovine fibromodulin cDNA (6Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2601-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was used to isolate several overlapping genomic clones from a cosmid mouse 129/sv library (kindly provided by J. S. Mudgett, Merck, Rahway, NJ). A 8-kilobase pair EcoRI/SalI fragment that includes exon 2 was subcloned in pBluescript KS II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). ABamHI site located 5 kilobase pairs from the 5′ end of the genomic fragment was used for the insertion of a phosphoglycerate kinase-neomycin resistance cassette (pGKNeo) (35McBurney M.W. Sutherland L.C. Adra C.N. Leclair B. Rudnicki M.A. Jardine K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 5755-5761Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which interrupts the coding sequence in exon 2 at a Trp residue located in position 8 of the mature mouse fibromodulin (GenBankTM accession numberX94998). The resistance cassette pGKNeo was blunt end ligated into theBamHI site in the opposite transcriptional orientation of the fibromodulin gene. The targeting vector also contained a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase cassette, pIC19R/MC1-Tk (36Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar), which was blunt end ligated in the NaeI site of pBluescript KSII prior to insertion of the genomic fragment. R1 embryonic stem cells (37Nagy A.J. Rossant R. Nage W. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) were grown and electroporated as described previously (38Fässler R. Schnegelsberg P.N.J. Dausman J. Shinya T. Muragaki Y. McCarthy M.T. Olsen B.R. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5070-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, the targeting vector (45 μg) was linearized with NotI and used in the electroporation of 3 × 107 embryonic stem cells. The cells were selected with 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.2 μm FIAU (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Wallingford, CT). Individual clones were picked and isolated DNA was screened by Southern blotting after digestion withEcoRI. Filters were hybridized with a 300-bpEcoRI/SalI external probe to identify targeted clones (see Fig. 1). Two individually targeted ES cell clones were used to generate chimeric mice as described (38Fässler R. Schnegelsberg P.N.J. Dausman J. Shinya T. Muragaki Y. McCarthy M.T. Olsen B.R. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5070-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Chimeric males were mated with C57/B6 mice, and males with germ line transmission were further bred with 129/sv females to establish an inbred strain of fibromodulin-null mice. Total RNA was isolated from mouse tails or tendons using guanidine isothiocyanate. After CsCl gradient centrifugation, RNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in formaldehyde, and fibromodulin mRNA was detected on the filters as described previously (6Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2601-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted from tails using 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing the protease inhibitor Complete (Boehringer Mannheim) as described (39Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Paulsson M. Antonsson P. Hedbom E. Wendel M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20428-20433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h at 4 °C, the extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to precipitation with 9 volumes of 95% ethanol. The protein precipitates were reprecipitated twice with 9 volumes of ethanol after resuspension in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8. Finally the precipitates were dissolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters by diffusion and detected using a rabbit antiserum against bovine fibromodulin as described (6Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2601-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).

FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and bovine fibromodulin (6Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2601-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) were used in protein transfer blots, ELISA, and immunostainings of mouse tissues. An antiserum against mouse lumican was prepared in rabbits using a bacterially produced lumican/glutatione-thio-transferase fusion protein as described (41Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Moses J. Fransson L.-Å. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). AMscI/StuI fragment from exon 2 of the mouse lumican gene was ligated in pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This DNA encodes a 66-residue-long peptide, corresponding to residues 19–84 in the mouse sequence (GenBankTM accession numberAF013262). Fusion protein was produced and purified as recommended by the manufacturer. ELISA was performed as described previously (39Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Paulsson M. Antonsson P. Hedbom E. Wendel M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20428-20433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microtiter plates were coated with recombinant mouse decorin, mouse fibromodulin, and mouse lumican fusion proteins, which were produced in bacteria and purified as recommended by the manufacturers. A mouse lumican/maltose-receptor fusion protein was prepared by ligating a MscI/StuI genomic fragment (see above under “Immunological Methods”) in pMALp (New England Biolabs). Recombinant mouse lumican fusion protein was isolated on amylose-Sepharose. A full-length mouse decorin cDNA was prepared using mRNA from mouse tail. The mRNA was converted to cDNA with oligo(dT) primers and reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim). The single-stranded cDNA was amplified using the primers 5′-CCGGATCCATGAAGGCAACTCTCATCTTC and 5′-GGGGTACCTTGTAGTTTCCAAGTTGAATG (42Scholzen T. Solursh M. Suzuki S. Reiter R. Morgan J.L. Buchberg A.M.

Amplification conditions were 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated in the BamHI/KpnI site of pQE 30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), expressed as a His-tagged protein in bacteria and purified on nickel-agarose. Mouse fibromodulin antigen was also produced as a His-tagged protein. Single-stranded cDNA derived from mouse tail mRNA (see above under “RNA and Protein Transfer Blot Analysis”) was amplified using the primers 5′-TCCCCCGGGGATGCAGTGGGCCTCCGTC and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCAGATCCGATGAGGTTGG (GenBankTM accession numberX94998) and polymerase chain reaction conditions as described above for the production of mouse decorin. A BglII/HindIII fragment, representing a 189-amino acid-residue C-terminal fragment was ligated in pQE30 (Qiagen). Recombinant protein was expressed in bacteria and purified as described above. Protein extracts from tails or tail tendons were prepared as described (39Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Paulsson M. Antonsson P. Hedbom E. Wendel M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20428-20433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), precipitated with ethanol and redissolved in 0.14 mNaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 3 mm NaN3, pH 7.4, containing 0.8% SDS. Protein concentrations in extracts were determined according to Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using a Coomassie protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Immunolocalization of proteins in mouse tissues was performed on paraffin sections of mouse tails and Achilles tendon as described (44Aszodi A. Modis A. Paldi A. Rencendorj I. Kiss I. Bösze Z. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Tails were fixed in 95% ethanol, 1% acetic acid and decalcified in 6% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 week prior to dehydration and embedding. Achilles tendons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. For histological analysis, paraffin sections of tail, sternum, knee-joint, muscle, and inner organs were stained with hematoxylin and Chromotrope 2R (Sigma). Ribonuclease protection assays were used to determine amounts of mRNA. Total RNA was isolated from tails or tail tendons after extraction with guanidine isothiocyanate and centrifugation through a CsCl cushion as described (6Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2601-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the total RNA using an oligo(dT) matrix kit (Qiagen). Antisense mouse lumican mRNA was prepared using a 258-bp MscI/XbaI fragment (GenBankTM accession number AFO13262) of the mouse lumican gene ligated in pBluescript KSII, using T7 RNA polymerase and a RNA transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Antisense mouse actin RNA was transcribed from pTRI-β-actin-mouse (Ambion). The protection assay was performed using a kit according to the manufacturer′s recommendations (Ambion). Protected double-stranded RNA was separated on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and the radioactivity was determined using a Bio Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Japan). Fibromodulin, lumican and decorin mRNA were localized by in situ hybridization on longitudinally cut paraffin sections of tail as described (45Apte S.S. Fukai N. Beir D.R. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25511-25517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and decalcification in 6% EDTA, 0.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin-UTP by in vitro transcription with SP6, T7, or T3 RNA polymerases using a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer′s recommendations. Antisense mouse fibromodulin probe was transcribed from a 267-bpBamHI/BglII cDNA fragment in pBluescript KSII using T7 RNA polymerase. Mouse lumican probes were transcribed from a 258-bp MscI/XbaI fragment ligated in pBluescript, where T7 RNA polymerase was used to produce an antisense probe and T3 RNA polymerase was used to produce a sense probe. A 324-bpBamHI/HincII mouse decorin cDNA fragment was ligated in pGEM7Z (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin), and T7 polymerase was used to produce an antisense probe, whereas SP6 was used to produce a sense probe. Tissues from littermates representing fibromodulin-null, heterozygous, and wild type mice of the same sex at 7 and 20 weeks of age were subjected to electron microscopy. Immediately after sacrifice, Achilles tendon samples were fixed by immersion in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate-buffered 2% glutaraldehyde containing 0.1 m sucrose. The specimens were postfixed in 0.1 m s-collidine-buffered 2% osmium, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in an epoxy resin according to standard procedure (46Reinholt F.P. Engfelt B. Hjerpe A. Jansson K. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1982; 80: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Samples cut longitudinally or transversely with respect to the main axis of collagen fibers were studied. Micrographs from transverse sections of the tendon were sampled by systematic random sampling and subjected to morphometry. Thus, from each animal the diameter of each of the transversely cut collagen fibrils of the tendon was measured on 20 micrographs from two tissue blocks with an interactive optomechanical particle size analyzer and presented in a histogram. The fibromodulin gene was inactivated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells with a targeting vector interrupting the coding sequence in exon 2 with a neomycin resistance cassette (Fig. 1). After transformation and selection with G418 and FIAU, we identified three correctly targeted clones out of 150 screened. Two of these were used to produce chimeric mice, which were mated with C57/B6 females. Chimeric males with germ line transmission were mated with 129/sv females to generate an inbred strain. Breeding of heterozygous mice resulted in the recovery of homozygous and heterozygous mice in the proportions expected for a single copy gene mutation. The fibromodulin-null mice did not exhibit any gross anatomical abnormalities, grew to normal size, were fertile, and had a normal life span. Light microscopic investigations of heart, liver, lung, kidney, skin, and cartilage did not reveal any abnormalities. Transfer blot analysis of proteins extracted from tails showed the absence of fibromodulin in the null mice (Fig.2 A). Northern blot analysis showed an absence of fibromodulin mRNA in fibromodulin-null mice and about half the amount in heterozygous mice as compared with wild type mice (Fig. 2 B). Hematoxylin/chromotrope stained cross-sections of tails revealed abnormal tendon collagen fiber bundles in fibromodulin-null and heterozygous mice. In comparison the tendon fiber bundles in wild type animals are highly organized with evenly distributed cells (Fig. 3,A–C). In fibromodulin-null animals most fiber bundles have a different appearance and show an abnormal morphology (Fig. 3,G–I), as compared with those in wild type mice. Also in heterozygous animals, 10–20% of the collagen fiber bundles are similar to the abnormal bundles in fibromodulin-null mice (Fig. 3,D–F). The abnormal fiber bundles appear less organized with unevenly distributed cells. The transverse sections suggest fewer cells in fibromodulin-null as compared with wild type tendon. However, longitudinal sections indicate that a similar number of fibroblasts are present in fibromodulin-null and wild type tendon fibers. The abnormal fiber bundles also appear to have reduced endotenon tissue, which is composed of cells and loose connective tissue surrounding these bundles (47Blevins F.T. Djurasovic M. Flatow E.L. Vogel K.G. Orthop. Clin. North Am. 1997; 28: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In association the fibromodulin-null collagen bundles appear to shrink more during the fixation and also detach from the surrounding tissues. Furthermore, the number of fiber bundles, surrounded by epitenon (47Blevins F.T. Djurasovic M. Flatow E.L. Vogel K.G. Orthop. Clin. North Am. 1997; 28: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), is reduced in fibromodulin-null and to a lesser degree also in heterozygous animals. Counting fiber bundles in four groups of littermates (1, 1.5, 3.5, and 20 months old) shows a 25–55% reduction in fibromodulin-null as compared with wild type littermates. Heterozygous animals had 0–32% less bundles than wild type. The distribution of fibromodulin, lumican, and decorin was investigated in cross-sections of tails using immunohistochemistry. In wild type animals fibromodulin is preferentially present in the collagen bundles of tendons, but also a weaker staining of the dermis was observed (Fig.4 A). Lumican was preferentially detected in dermis and in peritenon tissues immediately surrounding tendons in wild type mice (Fig. 4 B), whereas the decorin antiserum showed staining in tendons and skin (Fig.4 C). The fibromodulin, lumican, and decorin staining patterns in heterozygous and wild type tail samples showed differences in the collagen fiber bundles. Fiber bundles with an abnormal morphology stained weakly with the lumican antiserum (Fig.4 E) and showed an uneven, patchy staining pattern with fibromodulin (Fig. 4 D) and decorin (Fig. 4 F) antisera. Fibromodulin was absent in fibromodulin-null mice (Fig.4 G), where we observed a change in the amount and distribution of lumican. The anti-lumican staining in fib"

Treatment is unsatisfactory, and the pathogenesis unclear. Lower airway lymphocyte and eosinophil recruitment and activation are strongly implicated, but the mechanisms regulating these processes are unknown. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) has a central role in inflammatory cell recruitment to the airways in asthma and is the cellular receptor for 90% of rhinoviruses. We hypothesized that rhinovirus infection of lower airway epithelium might induce ICAM-1 expression, promoting both inflammatory cell infiltration and rhinovirus infection. We therefore investigated the effect of rhinovirus infection on respiratory epithelial cell ICAM-1 expression and regulation to identify new targets for treatment of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. We observed that rhinovirus infection of primary bronchial epithelial cells and the A549 respiratory epithelial cell line increased ICAM-1 cell surface expression over 12- and 3-fold, respectively. We then investigated the mechanisms of this induction in A549 cells and observed rhinovirus-induction of ICAM-1 promoter activity and ICAM-1 mRNA transcription. Rhinovirus induction of ICAM-1 promoter activity was critically dependent upon up-regulation of NF-κB proteins binding to the −187/−178 NF-κB binding site on the ICAM-1 promoter. The principal components of the rhinovirus-induced binding proteins were NF-κB p65 homo- or heterodimers.

Asthma exacerbations are the major cause of asthma morbidity and mortality. Respiratory viral infections have recently been associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations in both adults and children. In community-based studies, viral infections were identified in 80–85% of exacerbations in children and 44% of exacerbations in adults (2Johnston S.L. Pattemore P.K. Sanderson G. Smith S. Lampe F. Josephs L.K. Symington P. O'Toole S. Myint S.H. Tyrrell D.A.J. Holgate S.T. Br. Med. J. 1995; 310: 1225-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 3Nicholson K.G. Kent J. Ireland D.C. Br. Med. J. 1993; 307: 982-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Viral infections have also been strongly implicated in more severe asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization in both children and in adults (4Johnston S.L. Pattemore P.K. Sanderson G. Smith S. Campbell M.J. Josephs L.K. Cunningham A. Robinson B.S. Myint S.H. Ward M.J. Tyrrell D.A.J. Holgate S.T. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In all of these studies, rhinovirus infections caused around 65% of exacerbations in which a virus was identified (2Johnston S.L. Pattemore P.K. Sanderson G. Smith S. Lampe F. Josephs L.K. Symington P. O'Toole S. Myint S.H. Tyrrell D.A.J. Holgate S.T. Br. Med. J. 1995; 310: 1225-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 3Nicholson K.G. Kent J. Ireland D.C. Br. Med.

Rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations therefore cause enormous morbidity, especially among children, and represent a major health and economic problem. To date, no safe effective therapy is available, since prophylactic inhaled steroids are ineffective (5Doull I.J.M. Lampe F.C. Smith S. Schreiber J. Freezer N.J. Holgate S.T. Br. Med. J. 1997; 315: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), while intervention with high dose inhaled steroids is only partially effective (6Wilson N. Silverman M. Arch. Dis. Child. 1990; 65: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations would greatly aid the development of new therapies for this common condition. The mechanisms by which rhinoviruses trigger asthma exacerbations are poorly understood. Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the lower respiratory airways, and lower airway inflammatory changes have been described during experimental rhinovirus colds. A marked bronchial CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration was observed in biopsies taken at the height of cold symptoms in both normal and in asthmatic subjects (7Fraenkel D.J. Bardin P.G. Sanderson G. Lampe F. Johnston S.L. Holgate S.T. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, the eosinophil infiltrate was more prolonged in the asthmatic subjects, still present 6–8 weeks after infection, while the eosinophil counts in normal subjects had returned to base line (7Fraenkel D.J. Bardin P.G. Sanderson G. Lampe F. Johnston S.L. Holgate S.T. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Rhinovirus experimental infections have also been reported to increase allergen-induced eosinophil numbers in bronchial lavage fluid in atopic rhinitic subjects, while no change in eosinophil numbers was observed in normal subjects (8Calhoun W.J. Dick E.C. Schwartz L.B. Busse W.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2200-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and to increase eosinophil products in sputum supernatants in asthmatic subjects (9Grunberg K. Smits H.H. Timmers M.C. de Klerk E.P.A. Dolhain R.J.E.M. Dick E.C. Hiemstra P.S. Sterk P.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These data combined strongly suggest that rhinovirus-induced bronchial lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration and activation are probably very important mechanisms in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. The increased airway reactivity demonstrated in experimental rhinovirus infections in asthmatic subjects (9Grunberg K. Smits H.H. Timmers M.C. de Klerk E.P.A. Dolhain R.J.E.M. Dick E.C. Hiemstra P.S.

Invest. 1989; 83: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) also provide indirect evidence of a link between lower respiratory inflammation during rhinovirus experimental infections and the mechanisms of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Finally, evidence that the lymphocytic and eosinophilic inflammation observed during rhinovirus experimental infections (7Fraenkel D.J. Bardin P.G. Sanderson G. Lampe F. Johnston S.L. Holgate S.T. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 8Calhoun W.J. Dick E.C. Schwartz L.B. Busse W.W. J. Clin.

Care Med. 1997; 156: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) is probably also an important mechanism involved in virus-induced asthma exacerbations comes from the fact that asthma exacerbations have been induced by experimental rhinovirus infections (9Grunberg K. Smits H.H. Timmers M.C. de Klerk E.P.A. Dolhain R.J.E.M. Dick E.C. Hiemstra P.S. Sterk P.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Dis. 1985; 132: 976-980PubMed Google Scholar). Rhinovirus RNA has recently been detected in bronchial lavage cells taken during experimentally induced colds, suggesting that rhinovirus can promote local inflammation by direct infection of the lower airways (13Gern J.E. Galagan D.M. Jarjour N.N. Dick E.C. Busse W.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 155: 1159-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Indeed, rhinoviruses are capable of prolonged, noncytolytic infection of respiratory epithelial cells and induce production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6,1 IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (14Subauste M.C. Jacoby D.B. Richards S.M. Proud D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 15Zhu Z. Tang W. Ray A. Wu Y. Einarsson O. Landry M.L. Gwaltney Jr., J. Elias J.A. J.

Taken together, these data suggest that lower airway rhinovirus-induced inflammatory cell recruitment is a critical event in rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a cell surface glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin supergene family that is involved in leukocyte trafficking and accumulation at sites of inflammation. In addition to modulating eosinophil infiltration by binding to its ligand CD18/CD11b, ICAM-1 is involved in lymphocyte infiltration by binding to CD18/CD11a expressed on both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. There is now considerable evidence that ICAM-1 plays a central role in recruitment and activation of these inflammatory cells in the pathogenesis of asthma. Epithelial ICAM-1 expression is increased by allergen challenge in both allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis (18Ciprandi G. Pronzato C. Ricca V. Passalacqua G. Bagnasco M. Canonica G.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Ciprandi G. Buscaglia S. Pesce G. Villaggio B. Bagnasco M. Canonica G.W. J. Allergy Clin.

Immunol. 1993; 92: 857-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). High levels of epithelial ICAM-1, along with intraepithelial inflammatory cell infiltration, have been described in bronchial biopsies from subjects both with stable asthma and after allergen challenge (21Manolitsas N.D. Trigg C.J. McAulay A.E. Wang J.H. Jordan S.E. D'Ardenne A.J. Davies R.J. Eur. Respir. J. 1994; 7: 1438-1444Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Vignola A.M. Campbell A.M. Chanez P. Bousquet J. Paul-Lacoste P. Michel F.B. Godard F. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 148: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the important role of ICAM-1 in eosinophil recruitment came from a primate study that demonstrated that allergen challenge causing a dual asthmatic response up-regulated ICAM-1 expression in airway epithelium and endothelium, that eosinophil infiltration into the airways correlated with the epithelial ICAM-1 levels, and that anti-ICAM-1 antibodies prevented both the eosinophil influx and airway hyperreactivity (23Wegner C.D. Gundel R.H. Reilly P. Haynes N. Letts L.G. Rothlein R. Science. 1990; 247: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The critical importance of ICAM-1 in asthma pathogenesis has been emphasized by two further recent studies in murine models of asthma, which demonstrated ICAM-1 regulation of lymphocyte and eosinophil recruitment to the lower airway (24Broide D.H. Sullivan S. Gifford T. Sriramarao P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Chin J.E. Winterowd G.E. Hatfield C.A. Brashler J.R. Griffin R.L.

Biol. 1998; 18: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since epithelial infiltration of each of these cell types is specifically implicated in rhinovirus induced asthma (7Fraenkel D.J. Bardin P.G. Sanderson G. Lampe F. Johnston S.L. Holgate S.T. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 8Calhoun W.J. Dick E.C. Schwartz L.B.

Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), respiratory epithelial ICAM-1 expression is likely to play a very important role in inflammatory cell infiltration associated with rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. In addition to its important role in inflammatory cell recruitment and activation, ICAM-1 may play a critical role in rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations, since it is also the cellular receptor for the major group (90%) of rhinoviruses (26Greve J.M. Davis G. Meyer A.M. Fork C.P. Yost S.C. Marlor C.W. Kamarck M.E. McClelland A. Cell. 1989; 56: 839-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 27Uncapher C.R. De Witt C.M. Colonno R.J. Virology. 1991; 180: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Having observed previously that rhinoviruses are able to infect lower respiratory epithelial cells for several days without causing cytopathic effect and able to induce proinflammatory protein expression (16Johnston S.L. Papi A. Bates P.J. Mastronarde J.G. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 6172-6181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that rhinovirus infection of lower respiratory epithelial cells would also induce increased expression of ICAM-1. Rhinovirus induction of ICAM-1 in lower respiratory epithelial cells could then not only promote intraepithelial inflammatory cell recruitment and activation but also increase the severity of the epithelial cell infection and therefore further exacerbate the airway inflammation. Modulation of ICAM-1 expression would then be expected to have profound effects on the epithelial inflammatory cell infiltration associated with rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. To investigate this hypothesis, studies were undertaken to determine whether rhinovirus infection has the ability to modulate respiratory epithelial ICAM-1 expression in an in vitro model. Having found marked rhinovirus-induced ICAM-1 up-regulation in both primary bronchial epithelial cells and a human lower respiratory cell line, we investigated the intracellular mechanisms of rhinovirus induction of ICAM-1 expression to identify potential targets for modulation of rhinovirus-induced ICAM-1 in the therapy of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. A549 cells, a type II respiratory epithelial cell line, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD), and Ohio HeLa cells were obtained from the Medical Research Council Common Cold Unit (Salisbury, UK). Cells were split weekly and cultured at 37 °C in 5% carbon dioxide in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine, 80 mg/ml of gentamycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma, Poole, UK). Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were obtained by bronchial brushing from normal patients undergoing surgery. Cells were removed from the brush by vigorous shaking and were disaggregated in Clonetics (San Diego, CA) bronchial epithelial cell medium containing 3 mm DTT for 15 min. After washing, cells were plated onto collagen-coated 16-mm diameter culture wells and grown to confluence in bronchial epithelial cell medium. Cells were passaged in 100-mm Petri dishes and used in the assays at passages 3 and 4. For experiments, 70% confluent cells were detached using 0.05% trypsin with 0.02% EDTA and seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in 12-well culture plates. These cells are >95% cytokeratin 18-immunoreactive epithelial cells as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Rhinovirus types 16, 9 (major group), and 2 (minor group) were obtained from the Medical Research Council Common Cold Unit, and their identity was confirmed by neutralization with specific antiserum (ATCC). Viral stocks were generated by infecting monolayer cultures of HeLa cells until cytopathic effects were fully developed. Cells and supernatants were harvested, cells were disrupted by freezing and thawing, cell debris was pelleted by low speed centrifugation, and the resulting clarified supernatants were frozen at −70 °C. Rhinovirus titration was performed on the frozen aliquots by exposing confluent monolayers of HeLa cells in 96-well plates to serial 10-fold dilutions of viral stock. Plates were cultured for 5 days in 4% minimal essential medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cytopathic effect was assessed by visual assessment and by assessment of the continuity of the monolayer after fixation in methanol and staining with 0.1% crystal violet. Tissue culture infective dose 50% (TCID50)/ml values were determined (28Johnston S.L. Tyrrell D.A.J. Lennette E.H. Schmidt N.J. Diagnostic Procedures for Viral, Rickettsial and Chlamydial Infections. American Public Health Association, Washington, D. C.1995: 553-563Google Scholar), and virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 was used for all of the experiments except where indicated. For selected experiments, inactivation/filtration of the virus was performed by three different methods. Viruses were precoated with excess soluble receptor to saturate the receptor binding sites on the virus capsid. Virus stock solutions were preincubated with recombinant soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM; a gift of P. Esmon, Bayer Corp., Berkeley, CA) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for 30 min at room temperature. Viruses were inactivated by exposure to UV light at 1200 mJ/cm2 for 30 min. Virus particles were removed from inocula by ultrafiltration through membranes (Amikon, London, UK) to remove all molecules greater than 30 kDa, performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each method, confirmation of complete inactivation was carried out by microtiter plate assay for rhinovirus infectivity as described above. 2 × 105 A549 or primary bronchial epithelial cells were cultured in 12-well plates. When confluent, virus at an MOI of 1 or control media was added, and incubation continued for various periods of time between 1 and 72 h. Dose-response studies were carried out using 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 MOI, and cells were harvested at 8 h. Similarly, the effects of inactivated/filtered virus and the effects on primary bronchial epithelial cells were studied at 8 h. At the desired time points, cells were detached intact by incubation with 0.5 ml/well cell dissociation solution (Sigma) at 37 °C for 10 min. More than 95% of cells were viable as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. 105 cells were then washed and resuspended in PBA (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide) and incubated with saturating amounts of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human ICAM-1 (CD54) antibody or isotype-specific control antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. After washing, 104cells were analyzed for fluorescence by single color flow cytometry on a FACScan analyzer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Mean fluorescence intensity was measured and normalized relative to noninfected control cells after subtraction of background staining. 5 × 106 A549 cells were cultured in 100-mm plates until confluent, and medium alone or rhinovirus type 16 was added for various times between 1 and 24 h. Studies with inactivated/filtered virus were performed at 8 h. At the desired time points, cells were harvested, and ICAM-1 mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. Whole cell RNA was extracted using Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK). One μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed by superscript reverse transcriptase (100 units; Promega, Southampton, UK) in a total volume of 10 μl at 37 °C for 1 h using P1 (24 ng/ml) as specific primer (Table I). The cDNA (2.5 μl) was amplified by PCR in the presence of a master mix containing PCR buffer, MgCl2 (1.5 mm), 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega), 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 0.6 mm specific primer pair (P1 and P2; Table I). Cycling conditions were 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 25 cycles. First round products were diluted 1:100, and 2.5 μl was thereafter used for a nested amplification under the same PCR conditions, with P3 and P4 as inner primers (Table I). Final PCR products (10 μl) were electrophoresed through 1.5% agarose gels, stained in ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV light. In parallel, mRNA for adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), using primers indicated in Table I for 40 cycles at 56 °C, was evaluated in each sample as housekeeping gene control. Densitometry was performed using a scanning densitometer, and densitometric analysis was performed using the Phoretix program (Biometra Ltd., Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK) to express ICAM-1 mRNA relative to APRT mRNA.Table IOligonucleotides used in PCR analysesOligonucleotideSequenceICAM-1P1TATGGCAACGACTCCTTCTP2CATTCAGCGTCACCTTGGP3CTGTCACCTCGGTCCCTTCTP4CAGTGTG ACCGCACAGGACGAGGGCAAPRTP1GCTGCGTGCTCATCCGAAAGP2CCTTAAGCGAGGTCAGCTCC Open table in a new tab To confirm the quantitative nature of the PCR, cell lysate was diluted 3-fold in triplicate and subjected to RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and densitometric analysis. Isolation of nuclei and in vitro nuclear transcription were performed using standard procedures (29Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). Confluent cell monolayers (2.5 × 107 cells) were incubated with medium alone or rhinovirus 16 for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.14 m NaCl and lysed by the addition of 5% Nonidet P-40. The progress of lysis was monitored by trypan blue exclusion. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 1 min and were washed twice in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT. In vitro nuclear transcription was carried out for 45 min at 30 °C in 200 ml of this buffer supplemented with 1 mmeach of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP. For each sample, total RNA was extracted from 107 nuclei, before and after in vitro transcription, in the presence or absence of an RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin (1 mg/ml) (30Kedinger C. Gniazdowski M. Mandel Jr., J.L. Gissinger F. Chambon P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). ICAM-1 RT-PCR was subsequently performed (see above) for each different condition to detect in vitro transcribed products. The ICAM-1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) constructs were a generous gift of Dr. K. Degitz (Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munchen). They contained sequential deletions (−1160, −277, −182, −135, −88) of the ICAM-1 5′-flanking region linked to the coding region of the CAT reporter gene (31Muller S. Kammerbauer C. Simons U.

A plasmid containing the longest promoter deletion with a mutated −187/−178 NF-κB sequence (−1160m; mutated from TGGAAATTCC to TctAgATTag and confirmed by sequencing) and pBRAMScat2 vectors, composed of the CAT reporter gene and the herpes simplex virus minimal thymidine kinase promoter alone or linked to fragments of the ICAM-1 promoter (−199/−170 or −199/−182), were also kindly provided (31Muller S.

A549 cells were transfected with reporter constructs (10 μg) at 80% confluency by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique for 5 h, glycerol-shocked with 1× HeBS (0.02 m Hepes, 0.135 m NaCl, 0.5 mmNa2HPO4, 5.5 mmd-glucose, pH 7.1), 15% glycerol for 30 s and washed. Transfected cells were cultured in 10% minimal essential medium for 24 h, and rhinovirus 16 or medium alone was added. At designated time points, cells were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of rapid freeze-thawing in 0.25 m Tris, pH 8.0. Each sample was incubated at 65 °C for 15 min to inactivate endogenous transacetylases. Protein content was determined photometrically using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein-equivalent aliquots were assayed for CAT activity according to standard protocols (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 59-67Google Scholar). The assay was performed at 37 °C for 60 min in a reaction mixture of 1 mm acetyl coenzyme A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.1 μCi of 14C-chloramphenicol. Acetylated and unacetylated forms were resolved by thin layer chromatography, visualized by autoradiography, and measured on a scintillation counter. CAT activity was expressed as percentage of chloramphenicol converted to its acetylated derivatives. Uninfected and rhinovirus-infected A549 cells were prepared as described previously. At the desired time points (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min), the cells were mechanically detached, and nuclear extracts were obtained by a modification of the the method of Dignam et al. (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and resuspended in buffer A (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 0.5 mm DTT) with freshly added protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Membrane lysis was achieved by adding 0.5% Nonidet P-40 followed by vigorous agitation and incubation on ice for 5 min. The nuclei were then pelleted at 4 °C and resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and freshly added protease inhibitors as above). This suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged. The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was photometrically determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing wild-type and mutated sequences of ICAM-1 AP-1, NF-κB, Sp1, and C/EBP recognition sequences were obtained commercially (Oswell DNA Service, Southampton, UK). Mutant sequences were identical to those used in the mutant reporter c"

Importantly, we demonstrate that the phosphotyrosine binding domain of FRS-2 directly binds the Trk receptors at the same phosphotyrosine residue that binds the signaling adapter Shc, suggesting a model in which competitive binding between FRS-2 and Shc regulates differentiation versusproliferation. Consistent with this model, FRS-2 binds Grb-2, Crk, the SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP-2, the cyclin-dependent kinase substrate p13suc1, and the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Src, providing a functional link between TrkA, cell cycle, and multiple NGF signaling effectors. Importantly, overexpression of FRS-2 in cells expressing an NGF nonresponsive TrkA receptor mutant reconstitutes the ability of NGF to stop cell cycle progression and to stimulate neuronal differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2052376299,"The role of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, has recently gained attention. The present study demonstrates that IGF-1 promotes the survival of rat primary cerebellar neurons and of immortalized hypothalamic rat GT1–7 cells after challenge with oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Neuroprotective concentrations of IGF-1 specifically induce the transcriptional activity and the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor that has been suggested to play a neuroprotective role. This induction is associated with increased nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and with degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory protein IκBα. IGF-1-mediated protection of GT1–7 cells against oxidative challenges was mimicked by overexpression of the NF-κB subunit c-Rel. Partial inhibition of NF-κB baseline activity by overexpression of a dominant-negative IκBα mutant enhanced the toxicity of H2O2 in GT1–7 cells. The pathway by which IGF-1 promotes neuronal survival and activation of NF-κB involves the phosphoinositol (PI) 3-kinase, because both effects of IGF-1 are blocked by LY294002 and wortmannin, two specific PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Taken together, our results provide evidence for a novel molecular link between IGF-1-mediated neuroprotection and induction of NF-κB that is dependent on the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). It belongs to a superfamily of structurally related proteins that includes insulin and IGF-2. The biological functions of the IGFs and insulin are mediated by specific membrane receptors, designated the IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin receptors (2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 3Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IGF-1 receptor is the primary mediator of the action of IGF-1.Recently, IGF-1 has gained increasing attention for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons (4Murphy M.F.

Neurol. 1996; 40: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, with respect to the central nervous system, IGF-1 has been found to protect hippocampal neurons against the toxicity of the Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid β protein (Aβ) (6Doré S. Kar S. Quirion R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Aβ is the main component of the senile plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients and its cytotoxic action on neurons results from oxidative damage to susceptible cells (7Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been shown that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important intermediate in Aβ neurotoxicity (7Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). In accordance with a neuroprotective role of IGF-1 against oxidative injury, this growth factor is also effective in protecting neurons against glutathione depletion, suggesting a more general protective potency of IGF-1 against oxidative stress (8Sortino M.A. Canonico P.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).The molecular signaling pathways by which IGF-1 promotes survival, in particular survival of neurons of the central nervous system, are not well characterized. Dudek et al. (9Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar) revealed a critical function of the serine-threonine protein kinase Akt to mediate the protective effects of IGF-1 on the survival of cerebellar neurons against serum deprivation. Moreover, the inhibition of apoptosis by IGF-1 has been shown to require the activation of signaling molecules such as the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (9Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is composed of homo- and heterodimers of members of the Rel family of related transcription factors that are well characterized for controlling the expression of numerous immune and inflammatory response genes (11Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar, 12Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Frequently, NF-κB is present as a heterodimer comprising a 50-kDa (p50) and a 60-kDa (p65) subunit that is sequestered in the cytoplasm by an inhibitory protein of the IκB family, with IκBα being the best characterized member of this family (13Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 14Verma I.M. Stevenson J.-K. Schwarz E.M. van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). NF-κB-inducing agents, such as cytokines, viruses, phorbol esters, and UV light, result in the phosphorylation and degradation of the IκB inhibitory protein (15Israel A. Trends. Genet. 1995; 11: 203-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar) allowing free NF-κB to enter the nucleus, to bind to its cognate DNA sequences, and to induce target gene transcription.As for IGF-1, an important role for NF-κB during cell death has been suggested (17Wu M. Lee H.Y. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D. Fitzgerald M.J. Rothstein T.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4682-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Several reports have shown that NF-κB counteracts the induction of apoptosis by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (18Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that constitutively increased NF-κB activity mediates the protection of neuronal cells against oxidative stress (22Lezoualc'h F. Sagara Y. Holsboer F. Behl C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3224-3232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether IGF-1 offers neuroprotection against oxidative insult by affecting the activity of NF-κB as downstream target in neurons. For this study, two IGF-1 receptor-expressing neuronal cell systems were employed, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone-secreting neuronal cell line GT1–7 (23Tsai P.S. Werner S. Weiner R.I. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3831-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons (24Torres-Aleman I. Naftolin F. Robbins R.J. Neuroscience. 1990; 35: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Torres-Aleman I. Pons S. Arevalo M.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that IGF-1 exerts a neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress, mediated by a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway that finally leads to the activation of NF-κB.DISCUSSIONThe aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of IGF-1 to protect neurons against H2O2-induced neuronal cell death and to examine a possible involvement of NF-κB in this function. We employed GT1–7 hypothalamic neuronal cells and mature primary cerebellar granule neurons that have been shown to express functional IGF-1 receptors (9Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 37Olson B.R. Scott D.C. Wetsel W.C. Elliot S.J. Tomic M. Stojilkovic S. Nieman L.K. Wray S. Neuroendocrinology. 1995; 62: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As previously reported for other oxidative stressors, such as the Alzheimer's disease-associated Aβ and the glutathione depleting agent buthionine sulfoximine (6Doré S. Kar S. Quirion R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 8Sortino M.A. Canonico P.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we found that IGF-1 is effective in protecting neuronal cells against oxidative injury induced by H2O2. A 24-h pretreatment with 50 ng/ml of IGF-1 caused an enhanced cell survival of about 30% after H2O2 challenge in GT1–7 cells and primary mature postmitotic neurons of 5 days in vitro. IGF-1 did not significantly affect GT1–7 cell growth in serum-free conditions (data not shown), confirming that the increased cell survival is not due to a proliferative effect of IGF-1 in this neuronal system.The fact that IGF-1 is a potent neuroprotective agent against oxidative stress induced by the lipid peroxidizing agent H2O2 may offer a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in which free radicals have been implicated. For instance, IGF-1 has been shown to reduce neuronal cell loss observed in vivo following ischemic insults and is beneficial in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (38Doré S. Kar S. Quirion R. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 39Loddick S.A. Liu X.J. Lu Z.X. Liu C. Behan D.P. Chalmers D.C. Foster A.C. Vale W.W. Ling N. De Souza E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 17: 1894-1898Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). With respect to its potency to rescue neurons against Aβ toxicity (38Doré S. Kar S. Quirion R. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), one can likewise imagine that the development of IGF-1-related compounds could be a promising strategy toward the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.The PI 3-kinase pathway has been shown to be implicated in the signaling of IGF-1-mediated cell survival, including survival of neurons (9Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 40Cross D.A. Alessi D.R.

PI 3-kinase phosphorylates inositol lipids that act as second messengers for several targets, such as the serine-threonine kinase Akt (41Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar), which has been shown accordingly to be involved in anti-apoptotic signaling (42Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C.

Experiments with pharmacological inhibitors demonstrated that IGF-1-mediated neuroprotection against serum deprivation in neuronal cells is dependent on PI 3-kinase activity (9Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 10Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).The data obtained in the present study extend this observation showing that the PI 3-kinase pathway is also involved in the protective effect of IGF-1 against H2O2-induced cell death. Two potent PI 3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 (35Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 5241-5248Google Scholar) and wortmannin (36Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar), were able to block the cellular protection afforded by IGF-1 against oxidative challenge in GT1–7 cells. The data from Parizzas et al. (10Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) additionally suggest a role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in IGF-1-mediated neuroprotection because the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 could not completely be blocked by inhibition of the PI 3-kinase pathway in the PC12 cells employed in their study. In our cellular system, the neuroprotective effect of IGF-1 was entirely prevented by blocking PI 3-kinase, arguing against the involvement of other signal transduction pathways in IGF-1-mediated neuroprotection.Because the transcription factor NF-κB can modulate neuronal vulnerability and has recently gained great interest for its potential role in neuroprotection (45Lipton S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 1: 20-22Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 46Lezoualc'h F. Behl C. Mol. Psychiatry. 1998; 3: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 47Taglialatela G. Kaufmann J.A. Trevino A. Perez-Polo J.R. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of IGF-1 to induce NF-κB activation. We found that increasing concentrations of IGF-1 in GT1–7 cells stimulate the NF-κB transcriptional activity with a substantial effect at 50 ng/ml. These results were also confirmed in postmitotic cerebellar granule neurons, indicating that the enhancement of NF-κB activity by IGF-1 is not dependent on the cell cycle. Consistent with this increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity, NF-κB DNA binding activity could also be enhanced upon stimulation with 50 ng/ml IGF-1 in both neuronal systems. In agreement with these findings, we observed increased nuclear translocation of the p65-subunit of NF-κB and a parallel decrease in the amount of the NF-κB cytoplasmic inhibitory protein, IκBα. Thus, the induction of NF-κB-driven protective transcriptional programs by IGF-1 could be one way for the neurons to protect themselves against exogenous insults. In support of this hypothesis, we have recently shown that in a clone of the sympathetic precursor-like cell line PC12 selected for its resistance against Aβ and H2O2, constitutively increased NF-κB activity mediates this resistance. The suppression of NF-κB activation in these cells reverses the oxidative stress resistance phenotype (22Lezoualc'h F. Sagara Y. Holsboer F. Behl C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3224-3232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, the inhibition of NF-κB activation results in apoptosis in PC12 cells, and nerve growth factor did not protect from apoptosis when NF-κB activation is blocked (32Taglialatela G. Robinson R. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).To confirm the role of NF-κB in IGF-1-mediated neuroprotection, we (i) induced an activation of NF-κB by transient expression of the c-Rel subunit of this transcription factor, and (ii) inhibited NF-κB activity by expression of a dominant-negative form of IκBα. The expression of c-Rel in GT1–7 cells, which mimicked IGF-1 induction of NF-κB activity, protected these cells completely against oxidative stress, consistent with findings from other investigators showing that the c-Rel expression is able to reduce apoptosis in nonneuronal cells (17Wu M. Lee H.Y. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D. Fitzgerald M.J. Rothstein T.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4682-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 19Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the dominant-negative IκBα decreased the intrinsic survival of GT1–7 cells against oxidative insult, most likely by reducing the high basal NF-κB activity in these cells. However, this decrease in survival was not significant but rather indicative, which might be due to the fact that either the dominant-negative IκBα was not able to completely abrogate NF-κB activity (supported by the luciferase assay done in parallel) or additional factors, other than NF-κB, are involved in the protection of neuronal cells against oxidative stress. Together, these results suggest that the protection of neuronal cells by IGF-1 may be mediated, at least in part, through the activation of NF-κB.In view of the idea that the activation of NF-κB represents an intermediary step in IGF-1-mediated neuroprotection, one would expect that both processes are mediated by a common pathway. Upon investigating the effect of LY294002 and wortmannin on the IGF-1-induced transcriptional activity of NF-κB, it indeed turned out that these PI 3-kinase inhibitors completely blocked the IGF-1-induced increase in NF-κB mediated luciferase activity, indicating that the IGF-1 activation of NF-κB involves the PI 3-kinase pathway. In contrast to these findings, Bertrand et al. (48Bertrand F. Atfi A. Cadoret A. L'Allemain G. Robin H. Lascols O. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2931-2938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) reported that an insulin activation of NF-κB in Chinese hamster ovary cells does not involve the PI 3-kinase, but rather occurs via the Raf-1-mediated signal transduction pathway. However, these authors argued that the anti-apoptotic role of insulin in Chinese hamster ovary cells, besides NF-κB activation, additionally requires independent processes that involve PI 3-kinase activity (48Bertrand F. Atfi A. Cadoret A. L'Allemain G. Robin H. Lascols O. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2931-2938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The reasons of these apparent discrepancies remain to be investigated, but might be due to the different cell type and the specific stimuli applied to the cells. So far, besides Raf-1 (33Bertrand F. Philippe C. Antoine P.J. Baud L. Groyer A. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24435-24441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), various kinases have been reported to be involved in the pathway leading to activation of NF-κB, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) kinase kinase 1 (49Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and the kinase finally phosphorylating IκBα, conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase (50Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar), or IκBα kinase (51DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandhi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). Here we report for the first time that also the PI 3-kinase can participate in the induction of NF-κB activity, suggesting that dependent on the stimulus multiple NF-κB activation pathways may exist.The mechanisms by which NF-κB may prevent neuronal cell death upon stimulation with IGF-1 remain unknown. The activity of this transcription factor may drive defense programs that afford the protection against oxidative insult. Therefore, in future, it will be important to identify neuroprotective target genes of NF-κB and to investigate their inducibility by exogenous factors, such as IGF-1, to increase the survival of neurons under oxidative stress. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)1 is a pleiotropic factor with a wide spectrum of action in the central nervous system and also in the peripheral nervous system (1de Pablo F. de la Rosa E.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 143-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). It belongs to a superfamily of structurally related proteins that includes insulin and IGF-2. The biological functions of the IGFs and insulin are mediated by specific membrane receptors, designated the IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin receptors (2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 3Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IGF-1 receptor is the primary mediator of the action of IGF-1. Recently, IGF-1 has gained increasing attention for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons (4Murphy M.F. Felice K. Gawel M. Gelinas D. Kratz R. Lai F. Lange D. Natter H. Rudnicki S. the ALS/North America Myotrophin group Am. Neurol. Assoc. Abstr. 1995; 38: 335Google Scholar, 5Yuen E.C. Mobley W.C. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 40: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, with respect to the central nervous system, IGF-1 has been found to protect hippocampal neurons against the toxicity of the Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid β protein (Aβ) (6Doré S. Kar S. Quirion R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Aβ is the main component of the senile plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients and its cytotoxic action on neurons results from oxidative damage to susceptible cells (7Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been shown that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important intermediate in Aβ neurotoxicity (7Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). In accordance with a neuroprotective role of IGF-1 against oxidative injury, this growth factor is also effective in protecting neurons against glutathione depletion, suggesting a more general protective potency of IGF-1 against oxidative stress (8Sortino M.A. Canonico P.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The molecular signaling pathways by which IGF-1 promotes survival, in particular survival of neurons of the central nervous system, are not well characterized. Dudek et al. (9Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar) revealed a critical function of the serine-threonine protein kinase Akt to mediate the protective effects of IGF-1 on the survival of cerebellar neurons against serum deprivation. Moreover, the inhibition of apoptosis by IGF-1 has been shown to require the activation of signaling molecules such as the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (9Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 10Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is composed of homo- and heterodimers of members of the Rel family of related transcription factors that are well characterized for controlling the expression of numerous immune and inflammatory response genes (11Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar, 12Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Frequently, NF-κB is present as a heterodimer comprising a 50-kDa (p50) and a 60-kDa (p65) subunit that is sequestered in the cytoplasm by an inhibitory protein of the IκB family, with IκBα being the best characterized member of this family (13Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 14Verma I.M. Stevenson J.-K. Schwarz E.M. van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). NF-κB-inducing agents, such as cytokines, viruses, phorbol esters, and UV light, result in the phosphorylation and degradation of the IκB inhibitory protein (15Israel A. Trends. Genet. 1995; 11: 203-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar) allowing free NF-κB to enter the nucleus, to bind to its cognate DNA sequences, and to induce target gene transcription. As for IGF-1, an important role for NF-κB during cell death has been suggested (17Wu M. Lee H.Y. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D. Fitzgerald M.J. Rothstein T.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4682-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Several reports have shown that NF-κB counteracts the induction of apoptosis by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (18Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 19Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar), by ionizing radiation, and by the cancer chemotherapeutic agent daunorubicin (21Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that constitutively increased NF-κB activity mediates the protection of neuronal cells against oxidative stress (22Lezoualc'h F. Sagara Y. Holsboer F. Behl C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3224-3232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether IGF-1 offers neuroprotection against oxidative insult by affecting the activity of NF-κB as downstream target in neurons. For this study, two IGF-1 receptor-expressing neuronal cell systems were employed, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone-secreting neuronal cell line GT1–7 (23Tsai P.S. Werner S. Weiner R.I. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3831-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons (24Torres-Aleman I. Naftolin F. Robbins R.J.

We demonstrate that IGF-1 exerts a neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress, mediated by a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway that finally leads to the activation of NF-κB.

Here, we report purification of one of these and demonstrate that it is in fact the type VI IF protein nestin. Nestin is expressed in several fibroblastic but not epithelioid cell lines. We show that nestin forms homodimers and homotetramers but does not form IF by itself in vitro. In mixtures, nestin preferentially co-assembles with purified vimentin or the type IV IF protein α-internexin to form heterodimer coiled-coil molecules. These molecules may co-assemble into 10 nm IF provided that the total amount of nestin does not exceed about 25%. However, nestin does not dimerize with types I/II keratin IF chains. The bulk of the nestin protein consists of a long carboxyl-terminal tail composed of various highly charged peptide repeats. By analogy with the larger neurofilament chains, we postulate that these sequences serve as cross-bridgers or spacers between IF and/or other cytoskeletal constituents. In this way, we propose that direct incorporation of modest amounts of nestin into the backbone of cytoplasmic types III and IV IFs affords a simple yet flexible method for the regulation of their dynamic supramolecular organization and function in cells.

Of these three, IF are perhaps the most complex since they consist of more than 50 distinct proteins capable of forming morphologically similar filaments in different cell types (1$$Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 3Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Intermediate Filament Structure. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). Currently, six different types of IF have been described including the types I/II keratins (40 or more protein chains) generally expressed only in epithelia; four known type III proteins that are widely expressed in tissues and cells; four known type IV chains usually expressed only in neuronal tissues; several type V nuclear lamins expressed in many nucleated cells; and nestin, a single type VI protein expressed primarily in a variety of embryonic cells including those of the nervous system. Nevertheless, all known IF chains are built according to a common plan of a highly conserved rod domain consisting of four segments that form two-chain coiled-coils with another compatible chain, enabling assembly of polymerized IF, and end domains of variable size and chemistry, which provide IF with a wide variety of unique binding and regulating domains. This nomenclature system of the six IF types has been based largely on the exon/intron structures of their genes as well as subtle sequence differences of the rod domain segments: members of a given sequence type generally show high degrees of homology, whereas those of different types show lesser degrees of homology (1$$Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E.

Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). In this regard the status of the single protein nestin as a distinct type has been uncertain because its gene structure and protein sequence homology are of intermediate similarity to type IV IF chains (3Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Intermediate Filament Structure. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). Furthermore, its rod domain is built with minor differences from that of the other cytoplasmic IFs because it does not possess an L2 linker region, and there are less regular distributions of ionic charges on the 1B and 2B segments. The assembly proclivities of most IF chains are now well understood (1$$Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev.

Some chains are capable of assembly into IF by themselves, that is they are homopolymeric; examples include all type III chains and the type IV α-internexin and the neurofilament light chains (4Steinert P.M.

Many other chains require a partner for co-assembly; all keratin IF are obligate copolymers of virtually any type I chain with virtually any type II chain (8Hatzfeld M. Weber K. J.

However, the nature of these proteins and details of their interactions with vimentin/desmin have not been explored. In this paper, we have made the surprising observation that one of these proteins is nestin. In vitro assembly and biochemical experiments document that whereas nestin cannot form typical IF by itself, it can form homodimer and heterodimer coiled-coil molecules with purified vimentin and α-internexin which may participate by co-assembly into typical IF. BHK-21 cells were grown to 80% confluency in 850-cm2 roller bottles (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% tryptose/phosphate broth (Difco), 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. IF were then prepared from these cells with modifications from an earlier procedure (36Starger J.M. Brown W.E. Goldman A.E. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Specifically, cells were rinsed rapidly in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.6 m KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and the protease inhibitors 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin (all from Sigma). The extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to pellet the IF-enriched cytoskeleton. Chromatin and actin in the pellet were solubilized by treatment with 5 mg/ml DNase for 30 min at 4 °C. Following recentrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 30 min, the pellet of native IF and associated proteins was washed twice with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors as above. EGTA was present throughout the purification procedures in order to prevent apparent Ca2+-dependent proteolysis of proteins. This native IF preparation was solubilized into dissociation buffer containing 7.2 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester (1 ml/roller bottle of cells). Following centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, it was dialyzed into two changes of 500 volumes each of PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors as above. Reassembled vimentin IF and associated proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. This disassembly/reassembly procedure could be repeated several times. Further fractionation of the IF preparation was conducted by gel filtration. The pellet from the first recycling procedure as above was solubilized for 2 h in 1 ml/roller bottle of buffer containing 7.2m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2% ethylene glycol, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors for, and clarified by, centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a 100 × 2-cm column of Sepharose CL-400 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The flow rate was maintained at 6 ml/h. One-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar). Those containing the high molecular weight protein were pooled for ion exchange chromatography using a 5 × 1-cm column of Sepharose MonoQ FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer. The high molecular weight protein was eluted at 0.3 m NaCl as a single sharp peak using a 0–1m gradient (see Fig. 2). Similar Triton X-100/high salt extracts were made from a variety of other cultured cells using the same buffers and procedures. These included HeLa, NIH3T3, PtK2, and Pam212 cells. Each of these was obtained from ATCC and grown to near-confluency according to specifications. HaCaT cells were a kind gift of Dr. N. Fusenig and were grown as described (43Lee J.-H. Jang S.-I.

We also used normal primary human skin fibroblasts isolated from freshly excised neonatal foreskins (44Yuspa S.H. Harris C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 86: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and normal human epidermal keratinocytes (Clonetics) (43Lee J.-H. Jang S.-I. Yang J.-M. Markova N.G. Steinert P.M. J. Biol.

Hamster nestin clones were identified from a λ22a cDNA expression library constructed using poly(A)-enriched mRNA harvested from BHK-21 cells (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar, 47Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and a commercial cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The library was screened first with a monoclonal antibody against rat nestin (28Lendahl U. Zimmerman L.B. McKay R.D.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 585-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2778) Google Scholar) (PharMigen, San Diego, CA) and subsequently using two polyclonal antibodies raised, respectively, against the IFAP material of HeLa (38Aynardi-Whitman M.W. Steinert P.M. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1407-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or BHK-21 (39Yang H.-Y. Lieska N. Goldman A.E. Goldman R.D. J.

The four cDNA clones that were positive for all three antibodies were subcloned into pBluescript pKS vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced. All four clones possessed identical 3′-ends, and the longest (2,969 bp) encompassed the three smaller clones. The sequence was highly homologous only to rat (Ref.28Lendahl U. Zimmerman L.B. McKay R.D.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 585-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2778) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number M34384) and human (Ref. 29Dahlstrand J. McKay R.D.G. Zimmerman L.B. Lendahl U. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 589-597PubMed Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number X65964) nestins. As the hamster nestin clone identified an mRNA species of about 6.5 kilobase pairs by Northern blot analyses, reverse transcriptase-PCR methods were employed to extend the available sequence information. A first strand cDNA synthesis reaction was performed using poly(A)-enriched mRNA from BHK-21 cells and the hamster-specific primer 5′-CGTTGTCTCTCTAGTCACTT located toward the 5′-end of the longest λ22a clone. The resulting cDNA was then used for PCR reactions with primer pairs consisting of the hamster-specific primer 5′-TTCCGATGCCATCTG-CTCAT nested within the above first strand primer, and a series of primers of sequences that are conserved between rat and human nestins near their 5′-ends. For example, two such primers 5′-CTACCAGGAGCGTGGTC (rat nestin, from nt 706) and 5′-AAGTTCCAGCTGGCTGTGGAA (rat nestin, from nt 905) located in sequences encoding the 2B rod domain segment, yielded PCR products of 2,983 and 2,784 bp. They were sequenced following subcloning into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Dot matrix comparisons of the amino acid sequences were performed with the programs COMPARE and DOTPLOT using a software package from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UWGCG, Madison, WI). Secondary structure predictions were undertaken using the AASAP package, which incorporates the methods of Chou and Fasman (48Chou P.-Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar) and Garnier et al. (49Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar). Fourier transform analyses to examine the possibilities of periodic distributions of residues or residue types were done as described (50Parry D.A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 519-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant human vimentin (51Goldman R.D. Khoun S. Chou S.-H. Opal P. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and the keratin 5 and 14 chains (52Candi E. Tarcsa E. DiGiovanna J.J. Compton J.G. Elias P.M. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. An expression vector clone for human α-internexin was a generous gift of Dr. R. Liem. Following transfection into BL-21 Escherichia coli cells, protein was expressed in high yield and purified as described (21Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1657-1666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The isolated hamster nestin and the above recombinant proteins were dissolved in a buffer of 9.5 m urea, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, mixed (final protein concentrations in urea of 0.5–1 mg/ml) at the desired molar ratios, and then dialyzed into two changes of 1000 volumes of either L buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol or H buffer which is the same but contains 0.15 m NaCl as well. IF were examined by electron microscopy following negative staining with 0.7% uranyl acetate (37Steinert P.M. Zimmerman S.B. Starger J.M. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 6098-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). IF were pelleted (in 20–50-μl aliquots) at 100,000 × g in an Airfuge (Beckman instruments, Palo Alto, CA) for 30 min. Yields of protein in pellets were determined by protein assay (53Tarcsa E. Marekov L.N. Mei G. Melino G. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) or spectrophotometrically. Samples of IF assembly reactions in either L or H buffers were examined following cross-linking with 2 mm3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP) exactly as described previously (54Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 8766-8774Google Scholar, 55Steinert P.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the products were examined on 3.75–7.5% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue dye or electroblotted onto Nytran for Western analyses, using either anti-vimentin or the anti-nestin monoclonal antibodies, and then processed for development by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantitation as described previously (56Meng J.-J. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Steinert P.M. Ip W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21495-21502Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similar mixtures of proteins in 9.5 m urea solution were dialyzed into L buffer containing 2–9.5 m urea for 6 h and cross-linked with 0.1 m DTSSP. The higher concentration was needed to overcome the trace NH4+ ions in the solutions. The products were then resolved by 3.75–7.5% SDS-PAGE gels as above. Pellets of IF assembled from 1:4 molar mixtures of nestin and either vimentin or α-internexin (in which virtually all nestin was incorporated) were dissolved in 0.1m sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.6) at about 1 mg/ml and then pipetted over a 30-s interval into a solution of trypsin (Sigma, sequencing grade) in 50 mm N-ethylmorpholine acetate buffer (pH 8.3) to give a final enzyme:protein ratio of 1:100 and final protein concentration of about 0.5 mg/ml. After 10 or 15 min digestion at 23 °C, a 1.5-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) was added to terminate the digestion, and a one-tenth volume of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added to precipitate the α-helix-enriched products that were then pelleted at 15,000 × g. The pellets were redissolved in 50 mm sodium tetraborate containing 50 mm NaCl and chromatographed on a 5 × 1 cm FPLC column of Sepharose CL-4B (54Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 8766-8774Google Scholar). Protein material from peaks 2 and 3 was collected by precipitation at pH 5.2 as above, redissolved in borate buffer, cross-linked by use of DTSSP, and resolved on 3.75–7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Peak 3 material was further resolved on a MonoQ column in the same buffer using a 0–0.15 m gradient of NaCl. The resulting three peaks of protein were collected, pelleted, redissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile, bound to a solid support, and examined by 10 Edman degradation cycles of protein sequencing (21Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1657-1666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Some protein peaks from either the Sepharose or MonoQ columns in borate buffer were also used for estimates of α-helix contents by circular dichroism (57Candi E. Melino G. Mei G. Tarcsa E.

We have known for many years that native IF preparations isolated from BHK-21 fibroblasts as perinuclear “caps” following colchicine treatment contain numerous high molecular weight proteins in addition to the principal IF chains of desmin and vimentin (36Starger J.M. Brown W.E. Goldman A.E. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 37Steinert P.M. Zimmerman S.B. Starger J.M. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 620-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These IF preparations can be dispersed by dissolution in concentrated urea solutions or by resuspension in low ionic strength salt buffers, after which only traces of protein remain pelletable at 100,000 × g. When the urea is removed and or the ionic strength is subsequently raised to 0.15 m NaCl, the proteins in solution rapidly reassemble into morphologically native-like IF and >90% becomes pelletable (36Starger J.M. Brown W.E. Goldman A.E. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 37Steinert P.M. Zimmerman S.B. Starger J.M. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 6098-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, lane 2); essentially only actin remains in solution (Fig. 1, lane 3). Moreover, the bulk of the high molecular weight proteins initially present are co-pelleted (arrow). This process may be repeated several times. For these reasons, we have always referred to these proteins as IFAPs. In this study, we have purified one of these major co-assembling proteins. We first used size-exclusion gel filtration chromatography on a Sepharose CL-400 column, from which two closely spaced bands were recovered (Fig. 2 A). The upper of these was then purified to near-homogeneity by FPLC on a MonoQ column (Fig. 2 B), with a net yield of 1–2 μg/roller bottle. The lower band, which may be a degradation product or another distinct protein species, could not be separated by this purification scheme. Aliquots of this protein were digested with trypsin, and the products were resolved by fractionation using high pressure liquid chromatography (data not shown). A total of seven well resolved peptide peaks were sequenced, all of which displayed identity or high sequence homology only to rat (28Lendahl U. Zimmerman L.B. McKay R.D.G.

The elevated specific activity of the palmitoleoyl transferase under conditions of cold shock is attributed to greatly increased levels of lpxP mRNA.

We have recently purified LpxL to homogeneity and confirmed that lpxL is indeed the structural gene for the lauroyl transferase. 2S. M. Carty and C. R. H. Raetz, manuscript in preparation. The LpxL reaction product, Kdo2-(lauroyl)-lipid IVA, is the preferred substrate for the myristoyl transferase (9Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Clementz T. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The lpxM(msbB) gene displays distant, but nevertheless significant, sequence similarity to lpxL (19Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). High copy number plasmids bearing lpxM can suppress the temperature-sensitive growth of mutants defective in lpxL (19Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), presumably because LpxM acylates Kdo2-lipid IVA at a slow rate (11Clementz T. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In 1979, prior to the elucidation of the structure and biosynthesis of lipid A, van Alphen et al. studied the fatty acid composition of lipid A from E. coli grown at 37 °Cversus 12 °C (20Van Alphen L. Lugtenberg B. Rietschel E.T. Mombers C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At 37 °C, laurate was present at 0.16 μmol/mg of LPS, but it decreased to 0.05 μmol/mg at 12 °C (20Van Alphen L. Lugtenberg B. Rietschel E.T. Mombers C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The decrease in laurate at 12 °C was counterbalanced by the appearance of palmitoleate, which was present at 0.10 μmol/mg of LPS in E. coli cells grown at 12 °C (20Van Alphen L. Lugtenberg B. Rietschel E.T. Mombers C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Only trace amounts of palmitoleate were found in LPS at 37 °C. A similar effect of cold shock on lipid A composition was reported for Salmonella typhimurium (21Wollenweber H.-W. Schlecht S. Lüderitz O. Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that palmitoleate incorporation is catalyzed by LpxL, since palmitoleoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) is not a substrate for LpxL (9Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We now describe the induction of a novel palmitoleoyl transferase in extracts of E. coli cells subjected to cold shock (Fig. 1). This enzyme transfers palmitoleate from palmitoleoyl-ACP to Kdo2-lipid IVA, which is also the acceptor for the lpxL-encoded lauroyl transferase (Fig. 1). An inducible palmitoleoyl transferase would account for the appearance of palmitoleate in lipid A of cells grown at 12 °C. The palmitoleoyl transferase is not encoded by lpxL, but appears to be the product of another lpxL homologue found in E. coli (22Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar) that is now designated lpxP. The palmitoleoyl transferase is induced within minutes after cold shock and is accompanied by a massive increase in the levels of lpxPmRNA. A cold shock-induced acyltransferase has not been reported previously. [γ- 32P]ATP and [α-32P]dATP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products.

Biol. 1980; 138: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar) was used as the host for the vector pACYC184 (camrtetr p15A replicon) (73Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J.

Cultures were generally grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth consisting of 10 g of NaCl, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of Tryptone per liter (23Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Tetracycline was used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Lipid IVA and (Kdo)2-lipid IVA were isolated and purified as described (14Raetz C.R.H. Purcell S. Meyer M.V. Qureshi N. Takayama K. J. Biol.

Lauroyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, R-3-hydroxymyristoyl, and palmitoleoyl-ACP were synthesized from the corresponding fatty acids and commercial acyl carrier protein, using solubilized membranes from the acyl-ACP synthase overproducing strain E. coliLCH109/pLCH5/pGP1–2, as described previously (10Clementz T.

Cell-free extracts were assayed for palmitoleoyl transferase under conditions similar to those used for the lauroyl transferase (9Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (typically 20 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, and 6 μm(Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (32,000 cpm/nmol). Palmitoleoyl-ACP was included as the acyl donor at 12 μm, and the final concentration of enzyme was 0.1 mg/ml of crude cell free extract. The tubes were incubated at 12 °C for 5–60 min for MC1000/pSK57(lpxP +) or for 10–20 h for W3110 (wild-type) or MLK53 (lpxL −). Incubation at 12 °C improved the stability of the palmitoleoyl transferase and eliminated an interfering acylation of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA in crude extracts that was not dependent upon the presence of palmitoleoyl-ACP. The reaction was stopped by spotting 5 μl of the assay mixture onto a silica gel thin layer plate. After the spots were allowed to dry under a cool air stream, the plates were developed in the solvent chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (30:70:16:10, v/v), dried, and then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for about 16 h. The percent conversion of substrate to product was determined using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, and the specific enzymatic activity was calculated in nanomoles/min/mg based upon the original substrate concentration. The crude cell-free extracts were assayed for lauroyl transferase activity using lauroyl-ACP and (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as substrates, as described previously (10Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The assay temperature was 30 °C for the lauroyl transferase, unless otherwise indicated. Cultures (800 ml) were grown in Luria-Bertani broth at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 ∼ 0.4). Half of the culture was shifted to 12 °C. Samples (50 ml) were collected from the 12 °C and 30 °C cultures at the time of shift and at various times after the shift, as indicated. At each time point, the cells were immediately harvested by centrifugation at 4200 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The pellets were washed with 25 ml of 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA, and harvested as above. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA. The cells were broken using an ice-cold French pressure cell (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) at 10,000 p.s.i. To remove unbroken cells and large debris, the extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 4200 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant (referred to as the cell extract) was divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard (30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Cultures (typically 10 ml) were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 ∼ 0.4). A portion of the culture (5 ml) was shifted to 12 °C. At 1 h after the shift, 2-ml samples from the 30 °C and the 12 °C cultures were transferred to glass tubes at 100 °C, containing 0.5 ml 2.5% SDS, 1 m NaCl, and 50 mm EDTA, pH 8, to ensure rapid lysis (31Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The samples were rapidly mixed and were boiled in a water bath for another 2 min. After cooling to room temperature, the RNA was isolated by phenol extraction using Phase lock gel from 5Prime → 3Prime, Inc. (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar, 33Murphy N.R. Hellwig R.J. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TheA 260/A 280 ratio for all of the samples was between 1.7 and 1.9, and 10 μg of each RNA sample was used for each lane of the Northern blot. The Northern blot was done as described (34$$Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled DNA probe for thelpxP mRNA was constructed by digesting pSK57 withSalI and EcoRI to yield a 1.2-kilobase pair product containing lpxP. This fragment was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and it was purified using the QIAEX Gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). Then, 25 ng of the DNA fragment was used as the template for the Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). The labeling reaction was done with [α-32P]dATP (150,000 cpm/nmol) as recommended by the manufacturer. The probe was purified away from contaminating free nucleotides by using a NucTrap probe purification column (Stratagene). Commercial RNA standards were analyzed in parallel during electrophoresis (34$$Google Scholar) and were stained with methylene blue to estimate the size of the lpxP transcript. The dried Northern blot was visualized using a PhosphorImager. In E. coli or S. typhimuriumcells cultured below 15 °C, a palmitoleate residue replaces most of the laurate that is normally linked to lipid A in cells grown at 30–42 °C (20Van Alphen L. Lugtenberg B. Rietschel E.T. Mombers C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Wollenweber H.-W. Schlecht S. Lüderitz O. Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Conversely, no palmitoleate is detected in lipid A of cells grown above 30 °C (8Odegaard T.J. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J.

Biochem. 1983; 130: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We therefore assayed extracts of cells that had been shifted from 30 °C to 12 °C for 2 h during mid-log phase for the induction of a palmitoleoyl-ACP-dependent acyltransferase capable of using the key precursor (Kdo)2-lipid IVA as the substrate (Fig. 1). The latter was previously shown to function as the acceptor for a laurate residue (Fig. 1) in the reaction catalyzed by the Kdo-dependent acyltransferase LpxL(HtrB) in extracts of cells grown at 30 °C or higher (10Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 2, extracts (0.1 mg/ml) of wild-type E. coli shifted to 12 °C for 2 h converted (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA to a more rapidly migrating product in the presence of palmitoleoyl-ACP, as judged by TLC analysis (Fig. 2), indicative of palmitoleate transfer. However, no acylated product was formed in the absence of palmitoleoyl-ACP in such cold-shocked extracts. Very little palmitoleoyl-ACP-dependent acylation of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was detected in extracts of the 30 °C grown control cells (Fig. 2). The low assay temperature (12 °C) was necessary for demonstrating the induction of the palmitoleoyl transferase because of its instability at higher temperatures. In addition, the presence at 30 °C of an unrelated, interfering enzyme that transfers a palmitate residue from the 1-position of phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylglycerol to (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA or other lipid A precursors (35Brozek K.A. Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5170-5179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 3R. Bishop and C. R. H. Raetz, unpublished data. obscures the palmitoleoyl-ACP-dependent acylation activity (data not shown). The ACP-independent palmitoyl transferase reaction is suppressed by carrying out the assays at 12 °C (data not shown). To determine if the cold-induced activity was dependent upon the lpxL gene, we assayed the palmitoleoyl transferase activity in extracts of cold-shocked cells of strain MLK53 (17Karow M. Fayet O. Cegielska A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), in which the lpxL gene is inactivated by an insertion mutation. As in the isogenic wild-type strain, palmitoleoyl-ACP-dependent acylation of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was induced in MLK53 cells grown at 12 °C (Fig.3 A). Very little palmitoleoyl-ACP-dependent acylation was observed in assays of extracts made from MLK53 cells grown at 30 °C, but the low level of activity seen in such extracts does appear to be slightly higher than the wild-type controls (Fig. 3 A). The absence of the lauroyl transferase in extracts of MLK53 cells grown either at 12 °C or 30 °C was confirmed (Fig. 3 B), consistent with previous studies (10Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cold-induced palmitoleoyl transferase activity is independent of the lpxL gene. Cold shock also had very little effect on the activity of the lauroyl transferase in extracts of wild-type cells, which were assayed at 30 °C with lauroyl-ACP and (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as substrates (Fig. 3 B). E. coli contains two genes that display sequence similarity to lpxL. One of these, previously designated msbB (now termed lpxM as shown in Fig.1), encodes the myristoyl transferase that is required for the final acylation of lipid A in wild-type cells (11Clementz T. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J.

To determine if lpxP encodes the cold shock-induced palmitoleoyl transferase activity, we assayed the palmitoleoyl transferase in extracts of MC1000(pSK57/lpxP +), which containslpxP behind its native promoter on a pACYC184 vector, after shifting cells from 30 °C to 12 °C for 2 h. As shown in Fig.3 A, the palmitoleoyl transferase specific activity was about 7-fold higher in extracts of MC1000(pSK57/lpxP +) than in wild-type. However, the specific activity of the lauroyl transferase (LpxL) in extracts of MC1000(pSK57/lpxP +) was about the same as that in wild-type extracts (Fig. 3 B), and the lauroyl transferase was not induced by cold shock.

In the present study, we examined isoproterenol-evoked intracellular signal transduction pathways leading to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Inhibitors for cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) abolished isoproterenol-evoked ERK activation, suggesting that Gs protein is involved in the activation. Inhibition of Gi protein by pertussis toxin, however, also suppressed isoproterenol-induced ERK activation. Overexpression of the Gβγ subunit binding domain of the β-adrenoreceptor kinase 1 and of COOH-terminal Src kinase, which inhibit functions of Gβγ and the Src family tyrosine kinases, respectively, also inhibited isoproterenol-induced ERK activation. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of Ras and Raf-1 kinase and of the β-adrenoreceptor mutant that lacks phosphorylation sites by PKA abolished isoproterenol-stimulated ERK activation. The isoproterenol-induced increase in protein synthesis was also suppressed by inhibitors for PKA, Gi, tyrosine kinases, or Ras. These results suggest that isoproterenol induces ERK activation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through two different G proteins, Gs and Gi. cAMP-dependent PKA activation through Gs may phosphorylate the β-adrenoreceptor, leading to coupling of the receptor from Gs to Gi. Activation of Giactivates ERKs through Gβγ, Src family tyrosine kinases, Ras, and Raf-1 kinase. Activation of β-adrenoreceptors induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

There are two major subtypes, α and β, in adrenoreceptors (ARs).1 AR agonists such as norepinephrine (NE) (α and β), phenylephrine (PHE) (α), and isoproterenol (ISO) (β) have been reported to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (2Laks M.M.

Prolonged infusion of subpressor doses of NE increases the mass of the myocardium and the thickness of the left ventricular wall, suggesting that NE has direct hypertrophic effects on cardiac myocytes without affecting afterload (2Laks M.M. Morady F. Swan H.J.C. Chest. 1973; 64: 75-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We have reported that NE induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through both α- and β-ARs (7Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Aikawa R. Takano H. Yazaki Y. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PHE evokes hypertrophic responses in the cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats (5Thorburn A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and that expression of constitutively active α-AR induces cardiac hypertrophy in adult mice (8Milano C.A. Dolber P.C.

Both in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that ISO also stimulates expression of proto-oncogenes in cardiomyocytes and induces cardiac hypertrophy (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B. Gillespie B.J.

It has been shown that stimulation of α1-AR activates phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C via Gq protein and hydrolyzes phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (PKC) leading to activation of the Raf-1 kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) cascade (12Terzic A. Puceat M. Vassort G. Vogel S.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 147-175PubMed Google Scholar, 13Karliner J.S. Kagiya T. Simpson P.C. Experientia (Basel). 1990; 46: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). There was a report indicating that PHE activates ERKs and induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through the Ras-dependent pathway (5Thorburn A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Regarding β-AR-induced signaling pathways, stimulation of β-AR activates adenylyl cyclase through a different G protein, Gs. Activation of adenylyl cyclase produces a second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), leading to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (14Morgan H.E. Baker K.M. Circulation. 1991; 83: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). PKA activation is important for the control of cell growth and differentiation. cAMP/PKA has been reported to have an inhibitory effect on the activation of ERKs stimulated by growth factors in many cell types such as Rat-1 cells, smooth muscle cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, COS-7, and adipocytes (15Cook S.J.

On the contrary, in some cell types such as PC12 cells, Swiss-3T3 cells, and S49 mouse lymphoma cells, cAMP activates ERKs and potentiates the effects of growth factors on differentiation and gene expression (20Heidemann S.R.

In human endothelial cells, down-regulation of the α subunit of Gs(Gsα) abolishes β-AR-mediated ERK activation by ISO (25Sexl V. Mancusi G. Holler C. Gloria-Maercker E. Schutz W. Freissmuth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5792-5799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gsα-dependent cAMP elevation and PKA activation are responsible for the activation of ERKs. We and others have also demonstrated that β-AR agonists including ISO significantly activate ERKs and increase protein synthesis through cAMP/PKA in cardiac myocytes (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B.

However, the molecular mechanisms of β-AR agonist-induced ERK activation remain largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanism of ISO-evoked activation of ERKs in the cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats. We observed that ISO-induced activation of ERKs is dependent on both Gs/cAMP/PKA and Gi/Src/Ras signaling pathways. Quite recently, it has been reported that PKA activated through β-AR phosphorylates agonist-coupled β-AR, leading to a change of the receptor coupling from Gs to Gi (26Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). We examined whether phosphorylation of β-AR is critical to ISO-induced activation of ERKs also in cardiac myocytes. [γ-32P]ATP and [3H]phenylalanine were purchased from NEN Life Science Products.

Wild-type β2-AR (pRK5-β2-ARwt) and β2-AR mutant lacking phosphorylation sites for PKA (pcDNAI-β2-ARmut; point mutations of Ser residues at 261, 262, 345, and 346 to Ala) were kind gifts from R. J. Lefkowitz and Y. Daaka (26Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). All plasmid DNA was prepared using QIAGEN plasmid DNA preparation kits (Hilden, Germany). Cardiac myocytes from ventricles of 1-day-old Wistar rats were isolated as described previously (27Zou Y.

Cardiac myocytes were plated at a field density of 105cells/cm2 on culture dishes with culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum). The culture medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 48 h before treatment. After 24 h of plating cardiac myocytes on culture dishes, DNA was transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (27Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Aikawa R. Kudoh S. Shiojima I.

For each dish, 2.5 μg of HA-ERK2 plasmid DNA was transfected with or without 7.5 μg of other relevant plasmids such as β2-ARwt, β2-ARmut, βARK1495–689, Csk, D.N.Ras, or D.N.Raf-1. After transfection, the cells were maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h before stimulation with ISO. The transfection efficiency of each experiment was ∼1% in cardiac myocytes as assessed by LacZstaining after transfection of a LacZ-containing expression plasmid. Protein synthesis was determined by assessing the incorporation of labeled phenylalanine from the extracellular medium into the total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable cell protein (7Yamazaki T.

Cardiac myocytes were serum deprived for 2 days, pretreated with or without a variety of inhibitory agents, and then incubated for 24 h with ISO. [3H]Phenylalanine (1 μCi/ml) was added 2 h before the harvest. It has been reported that continuous long term (>24 h) labeling of cultured cardiomyocytes is intrinsically nonlinear, such that labeled amino acid accumulates asymptotically into protein (33Wiesner R.J. Zak R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L179-L188PubMed Google Scholar). Because it has been reported that the specific radioactivities of the aminoacyl-tRNA pool may be equilibrated after 5 min and remain so over 2 h of labeling (29McKee E.E. Cheung J.Y. Rannels D.E.

Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), pulse labeling for 2 h with [3H]phenylalanine is sufficient to achieve adequate equilibration of the specific activity of phenylalanyl-tRNA. At the end of the labeling incubation, the plates were placed on ice, quickly washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 30 min with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and washed. Precipitates were solubilized for 30 min in 1 m NaOH and neutralized, and total radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. ERK activities were measured using myelin basic protein (MBP)-containing gel as described previously (27Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Aikawa R. Kudoh S. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33592-33597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates were electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml MBP. ERKs in the gel were denatured in guanidine HCl, renatured in Tris-HCl containing Triton X-100 and 2-mercaptoethanol, and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation activities of ERKs were assayed by subjecting to autoradiography. The activity of transfected HA-ERK2 was assayed as described previously (27Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Aikawa R.

In brief, after transfection of HA-ERK2, cell lysates were incubated with an anti-HA polyclonal antibody. The immune complex was incubated with MBP and [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated MBP band was visualized by autoradiography. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and the association of Shc with Grb2 were examined by Western blot analysis as described previously (28Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Kudoh S. Aikawa R. Zhu W. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates were incubated with an anti-Shc or an anti-Grb2 antibody, and the immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) or an anti-Shc antibody, and the immunoreactivity was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's directions. The amount of β-ARs on the cell surface was examined by Western blotting after dividing the membrane fraction and the cytoplasmic fraction. Briefly, cells were lysed by RIPA buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml aprotinin). Whole lysate was first centrifuged at 200 × g to remove nuclei, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet cell membrane. The pelleted membrane fractions were washed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. After blocking with 30% non-fat dry milk, the membranes were incubated with an anti-β1-AR or an anti-β2-AR polyclonal antibody. The immunoreactivity was detected using the ECL system. Statistical comparison was carried out within three or more groups using one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We have demonstrated recently that β-AR stimulation by NE activates ERKs through cAMP/PKA-dependent pathways in cardiac myocytes (7Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Aikawa R. Takano H. Yazaki Y. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We therefore defined the role of cAMP/PKA in ISO-induced ERK activation. When cAMP was inhibited by a cAMP analog, RpcAMP (100 μm), ISO-evoked ERK activation was completely suppressed (see Fig. 1 A). Pretreatment with a PKA inhibitor, H89 (10 μm), also abolished ISO-induced activation of ERKs, whereas inhibition of PKC by calphostin C (1 μm) did not affect the ERK activation by ISO (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, PHE-induced activation of ERKs was suppressed by calphostin C but not by RpcAMP or H89 (Fig.1 B). These results suggest that cAMP-dependent PKA activation probably through Gs is required for ISO-induced activation of ERKs in cardiac myocytes. We next examined the possibility that Gi protein is involved in ISO-induced ERK activation because β-AR was reported to bind Gi (35Abramson S.N. Martin M.W. Hughes A.R. Harden T.K. Neve K.A.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and activation of Giprotein can activate ERKs in many cell types (37Letterio J.J. Coughlin S.R. Williams L.T. Science. 1986; 234: 1117-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 38van, C. E. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). We preincubated cardiac myocytes with 100 ng/ml PTX and then treated them with ISO or PHE. Activation of ERKs by ISO was abolished by the PTX treatment for 24 h, whereas PTX had no effect on PHE-induced ERK activation (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that PTX-sensitive Gi protein is responsible for ISO- but not PHE-induced activation of ERKs in cardiac myocytes. It has been reported recently that stimulation of Giprotein-coupled receptors activates ERKs by βγ subunits (Gβγ) but not by the α subunit (39Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Iniguez L.J. Touhara K.

Therefore, the role of Gβγ in ISO-induced ERK activation was examined by introducing HA-ERK2 and a minigene construct encoding βARK1495–689 polypeptides, which inhibit Gβγ-dependent activation of a wide variety of cell regulatory processes (39Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Iniguez L.J. Touhara K. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into cultured cardiac myocytes. ISO increased the activity of the transfected ERK2, and overexpression of βARK1495–689 completely suppressed the ISO-induced activation of ERK2 (Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest that ISO activates ERKs via the Gβγ-dependent pathway in cardiac myocytes. There is a possibility that blockade of Gimay lead to sustained stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and may induce sustained phosphorylation and desensitization (and perhaps down-regulation) of β-ARs (35Abramson S.N.

It has also been reported that PTX increases the sensitivity of β-AR to ISO (42Lonnqvist F. Arner P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To test whether pretreatment of cardiac myocytes with PTX might affect the density of β-ARs on the cell membrane, we examined the amount of cell surface β-ARs, β1-AR and β2-AR, by Western blot analysis after long term treatment with PTX. As shown in Fig.3, PTX did not affect the protein levels of β1-AR and β2-AR in membrane fractions. These results suggest that the inhibition of ISO-induced ERK activation by PTX is not caused by down-regulation of β-ARs. Gβγ has been reported to activate ERKs through non-receptor-type tyrosine kinases including Src family tyrosine kinases in many types of cells (28Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Kudoh S. Aikawa R.

Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). We examined whether tyrosine kinases are responsible for activation of ERKs induced by ISO in cardiac myocytes. Activation of ERKs by ISO was suppressed completely when cardiomyocytes were pretreated with a broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, whereas the activation of ERKs by PHE was not affected by the same pretreatment (Fig.4 A). These suggest that tyrosine kinases are involved in ISO-induced activation of ERKs in cardiac myocytes, whereas PHE-induced activation of ERKs is not dependent on the tyrosine kinase pathway. We examined further the role of Src family tyrosine kinases in ISO-induced ERK activation in cardiac myocytes. Csk has been reported to phosphorylate the tyrosine residue in the carboxyl terminus of Src family protein kinases and thereby inactivate their function (44Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hata A. Sabe H. Kurosaki T. Takata M. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7306-7313Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We cotransfected Csk with ERK2 into cardiomyocytes and examined the activity of the transfected ERK2 after stimulation with ISO or PHE. Although cotransfection of Csk did not affect PHE-induced ERK2 activation, overexpression of Csk completely inhibited activation of ERK2 by ISO (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that Src family tyrosine kinases are also involved in ISO-induced ERK activation in cardiac myocytes. Adapter proteins containing Src homology 2 domains such as Shc and Grb2 transduce activation of tyrosine kinases to the Ras/ERK pathway via the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos (46Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G.

Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Shc is activated by ISO in cardiac myocytes. ISO rapidly (within 30 s) increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of 52-kDa Shc (Fig.5 A). Phosphorylation levels decreased from 5 min and returned to the basal levels by 15 min. A faint band corresponding to 46-kDa Shc was also observed with long exposure (data not shown). Next, association of Grb2 with Shc was examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Grb2 antibody and immunoblotting with an anti-Shc antibody. The intensities of the bands around 52 kDa and 46 kDa corresponding to Shc were enhanced by ISO stimulation (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the 52- and 46-kDa Shc form a complex with Grb2 after ISO stimulation. Association of Grb2 with Shc usually results in the recruitment of a Ras activator Sos to the membrane fraction, leading to activation of Ras (46Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J.

ISO-induced activation of ERKs was suppressed by overexpression of D.N.Ras (Fig.6 A), suggesting that activation of Ras is required for ISO-induced activation of ERKs in cardiac myocytes. Activated Ras usually induces activation of ERKs through Raf-1 kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (49Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J.

To identify protein residues in the C2 domain of cPLA2 essential for its Ca2+ and membrane binding, we selectively mutated Ca2+ ligands and putative membrane-binding residues of cPLA2 and measured the effects of mutations on its enzyme activity, membrane binding affinity, and monolayer penetration. The mutations of five Ca2+ ligands (D40N, D43N, N65A, D93N, N95A) show differential effects on the membrane binding and activation of cPLA2, indicating that two calcium ions bound to the C2 domain have differential roles. The mutations of hydrophobic residues (F35A, M38A, L39A, Y96A, Y97A, M98A) in the calcium binding loops show that the membrane binding of cPLA2 is largely driven by hydrophobic interactions resulting from the penetration of these residues into the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Leu39 and Val97 are fully inserted into the membrane, whereas Phe35 and Tyr96 are partially inserted. Finally, the mutations of four cationic residues in a β-strand (R57E/K58E/R59E/R61E) have modest and negligible effects on the binding of cPLA2 to zwitterionic and anionic membranes, respectively, indicating that they are not directly involved in membrane binding.

https://openalex.org/W1482257856,"Exogenous electric fields induce cellular responses including redistribution of integral membrane proteins, reorganization of microfilament structures, and changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i). Although increases in [Ca2+]i caused by application of direct current electric fields have been documented, quantitative measurements of the effects of alternating current (ac) electric fields on [Ca2+]i are lacking and the Ca2+ pathways that mediate such effects remain to be identified. Using epifluorescence microscopy, we have examined in a model cell type the [Ca2+]i response to ac electric fields. Application of a 1 or 10 Hz electric field to human hepatoma (Hep3B) cells induces a fourfold increase in [Ca2+]i (from 50 nM to 200 nM) within 30 min of continuous field exposure. Depletion of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium prevents the electric field-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane is responsible for the [Ca2+]i increase. Incubation of cells with the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 does not inhibit ac electric field-induced increases in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that receptor-regulated release of intracellular Ca2+ is not important for this effect. Treatment of cells with either the stretch-activated cation channel inhibitor GdCl3 or the nonspecific calcium channel blocker CoCl2 partially inhibits the [Ca2+]i increase induced by ac electric fields, and concomitant treatment with both GdCl3 and CoCl2 completely inhibits the field-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Since neither Gd3+ nor Co2+ is efficiently transported across the plasma membrane, these data suggest that the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by ac electric fields depends entirely on Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium.—Cho, M.

Additional intracellular dialysis of GDP-bound inactive Galphao or of a peptide corresponding to the Gbetagamma binding region of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase completely inhibited the Gbetagamma-induced stimulation of Ca2+ channel currents. The gating properties of the channel were not affected by intracellular application of Gbetagamma, suggesting that Gbetagamma increased the whole-cell calcium conductance. In addition, both the angiotensin AT1A receptor- and the Gbetagamma-induced stimulation of L-type Ca2+ channels were blocked by pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin, at nanomolar concentrations. Correspondingly, intracellular infusion of an enzymatically active purified recombinant Gbetagamma-sensitive phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PI3Kgamma, mimicked Gbetagamma-induced stimulation of Ca2+ channels. Both Gbetagamma- and PI3Kgamma-induced stimulations of Ca2+ channel currents were reduced by protein kinase C inhibitors suggesting that the Gbetagamma/PI3Kgamma-activated transduction pathway involves a protein kinase C.

Interestingly, the surviving cells had undergone dramatic aggregation concurrent with increased E-cadherin expression. When aggregation was inhibited by the addition of an E-cadherin-blocking antibody, apoptosis increased synergistically. We hypothesized that survival of the aggregated population was associated with contact-inhibited growth and that apoptosis might result from aberrant growth regulatory signals in non-aggregated, cycling cells. This hypothesis was confirmed by experiments that demonstrated that E-cadherin-dependent aggregation resulted in Rb-mediated G1 arrest and survival. Immunoblot analysis and flow cytometry revealed that hypophosphorylated Rb was present in non-aggregated, S phase cultures concurrent with synergistic cell death. We have also determined that the loss of membrane E-cadherin and subsequent hypophosphorylation of Rb in luminal epithelial cells preceded apoptosis induced by castration. These findings provide compelling evidence that suggests that E-cadherin-mediated aggregation results in Rb activation and G1 arrest that is critical for survival of prostate and mammary epithelial cells.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8669-8674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although PKC has become the focus of more extensive research in the apoptosis field, a specific mechanism has not been elucidated. A potential target of PKC action, with important ramifications in differentiation and development, is the cadherin family of transmembrane adhesion proteins. This hypothesis is supported by studies in which the PKC activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) has been shown to induce redistribution of E-cadherin to membranes and premature compaction in the mouse embryo (5Winkel G.K. Ferguson J.E. Takeichi M. Nuccitelli R. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Other studies using activators and inhibitors of PKC have also demonstrated a functional association between PKC and cadherins in a variety of cell types (6Fabre M. Garcia de Herreros A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 513-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lewis J.E. Jensen P.J. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3615-3621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Skoudy A.

Biol. 1997; 137: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); however, the identity of PKC isozymes and their regulation of specific cadherin targets have not been reported.In the prostate gland and mammary gland, inter-epithelial membrane adhesion is dependent on the homotypic interaction of E-cadherin (10Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar,11Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Such homophilic cell-cell adhesion results in the formation of desmosomes and adherens junctions that are required for tissue morphogenesis and the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype (10Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). The intracellular domain of E-cadherin is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with the cytoplasmic adapter proteins α-, β-, and γ-catenin/plakoglobin (12Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 13Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 14McCrea P.D. Gumbiner B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4514-4520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is essential for intercellular adhesion. Although central to the cell adhesion mechanism, E-cadherin has also been implicated in physiologic roles beyond the mere mechanical interconnection of cells. More recent evidence suggests that E-cadherin may also be associated with regulatory pathways involved in various aspects of cell fate including developmental decisions, cellular differentiation, and possibly cell survival (15Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 16Peifer M. Science. 1997; 275: 1752-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).Homeostasis of the prostate and mammary glands is dependent upon androgenic and estrogenic steroids, respectively. Depletion of these hormones activates a series of poorly defined molecular events leading to involution and remodeling of the tissue resulting from apoptotic death of the luminal epithelium. Although critical for tissue homeostasis, steroid hormones may not be exclusive to the regulation of cell survival since suppression of epithelial apoptosis also depends on their homotypic placement with adjacent epithelial cells and their attachment to the extracellular matrix. The first visible stage of prostate and mammary involution is the disruption of intercellular adhesion and anchorage prior to the onset of apoptosis (17Tenniswood M.P. Guenette R.S. Lakins J. Mooibroek M. Wong P. Welsh J.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, disruption of basal and lateral adhesion is often associated with apoptosis in involuting tissues (17Tenniswood M.P. Guenette R.S. Lakins J. Mooibroek M. Wong P. Welsh J.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 18Potter S.W. Gaza G. Morris J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that anchorage-dependent epithelium will undergo apoptosis following loss of integrin contact with the extracellular matrix (19Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 20St. Croix B. Kerbel R.S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1997; 9: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) or inhibition of integrin-mediated organoid formation (21Bates R.C. Buret A. van Helden D.F. Horton M.A. Burns G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It is now believed that just as integrins function to mediate cell-extracellular matrix interactions in anchorage-dependent survival, cadherins may also act in such a capacity, possessing a functional role in the regulation of intercellular adhesion-dependent survival. Several studies have reported the association between N-cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion and survival of gut and ovarian epithelium (22Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 23Peluso J.J. Pappalardo A. Trolice M.P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1196-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and recently an association between E-cadherin-mediated aggregation and survival of oral squamous carcinoma cells has been reported (24Kantak S.S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16953-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that homophilic binding of cadherin molecules on adjacent cells could transduce apoptotic suppressive signals; however, the actual mechanism by which cadherins mediate these signals is not known.We have previously demonstrated that integrin-mediated survival of prostate epithelial cells was uniquely regulated through the Rb cell cycle control pathway (25Day M.L. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Zhao X. Humphrey P. Swanson P. Postigo A.A. Zhang S.H. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8125-8128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have also investigated the functional role of PKC in the regulation of epithelial apoptosis, and we have demonstrated that PKC signal transduction, like integrin-regulated mechanisms, is capable of recruiting a Rb-regulated apoptotic pathway in prostate epithelial cells (3Zhao X. Gschwend J.E. Powell C.T. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Day M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22751-22757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In many cell types, apoptosis is thought to be a default pathway occurring where opposing or conflicting cell proliferation signals arise. For example, in the absence of serum growth factors, overexpression of c-Myc can initiate such a conflict by promoting the aberrant entry of cells into cycle (26Evan G.L. Brown L. Whyte M. Harrinton Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We have found that such a conflict arises when Rb growth-suppressive activity opposes mitogenic signals in proliferating cells. In support of this possibility, we found that transient expression of a constitutively active form of Rb induced apoptosis and that the inhibition of Rb function, by transfection of the Rb inhibitory oncogene, E1a, suppressed apoptosis (3Zhao X. Gschwend J.E. Powell C.T. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Day M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22751-22757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Day M.L. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Zhao X. Humphrey P. Swanson P. Postigo A.A. Zhang S.H. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8125-8128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These findings are in stark contrast with studies in which homozygous deletion of the RB1 gene resulted in increased apoptosis in mouse cells, suggesting an apoptotic-suppressive role for Rb (27Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 28Lee E.Y.-H.P. Chang C.-Y. Hu N. Wang Y.-C.J. Lai C.-C. Herrup K. Lee W.-H. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 29Clarke A.R. Maandag E.R. van Roon M. van der Lugt N.M. van der Valk M. Hooper M.L.

A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that Rb may influence both outcomes and participate in both cell survival and cell death.The adhesion molecules that mediate intercellular and extracellular matrix contact (31Ilyas M. Tomlinson I.P. J. Pathol. 1997; 182: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) largely regulate the normal growth of cells. Thus, an inadequate cell adhesion system, in which cells can easily dissociate from the primary tumor, may be a key determinant in the metastatic progression of certain cancers. In tumors of epithelial origin, the disruption of cellular adhesion appears to arise through alterations in the E-cadherin/α,β-catenin/adenomatous polyposis coli system, and as such, the loss of growth control may not be due to growth-promoting mutations but by the escape from apoptotic mechanisms (31Ilyas M. Tomlinson I.P. J. Pathol. 1997; 182: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 32Trosko J.E. Ruch R.J. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 208-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Accordingly, E-cadherin expression is often reduced in more advanced prostate tumors and lobular mammary tumors, supporting growing speculation about the role of E-cadherin as a metastasis-suppressor protein in these cancers (33Umbas R. Schalken J.A. Aalders T.W. Carter B.S. Karthaus H.F. Schaafsma H.E. Debruyne F.M. Isaacs W.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5104-5109PubMed Google Scholar, 34Umbas R. Issacs W.B. Bringuier P.P.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6107-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar).Herein, we describe a novel cell survival mechanism initiated by PKC in prostate and mammary epithelial cells in which E-cadherin-mediated aggregation resulted in Rb activation and G1 arrest necessary for survival. However, non-aggregated cells, which do not arrest in G1, undergo apoptosis, which we believe results from a fatal cell cycle conflict that occurs in S phase cells which contain hypophosphorylated Rb. Additionally, these findings are supported by the observation that the loss of membrane E-cadherin and subsequent hypophosphorylation of Rb in luminal epithelial cells occur in the involuting prostate gland.DISCUSSIONE-cadherin is essential for the formation of intercellular junctional complexes and the establishment of cell polarity, and its role in epithelial differentiation and maintenance of tissue integrity is well established (10Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar, 43Gumbiner B. Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have demonstrated that E-cadherin functions in a novel adhesion-dependent survival pathway that can suppress apoptosis of prostate and mammary epithelial cells. Our observation that PKC activation resulted in the rapid accumulation of E-cadherin and aggregation suggested that PKC initiated a phenotypic program in surviving prostate and mammary epithelial cells. Regardless of the phenotypic outcome, the observation that staurosporine inhibited all morphologic and molecular changes induced by TPA suggested that the fate of these cells, whether survival in an aggregated state or death of non-aggregated cells, had vastly divergent outcomes originating from a common PKC signal.Following PKC activation we found that the surviving population of aggregated cells contained hypophosphorylated Rb, were growth-arrested, and were resistant to apoptosis. These results strongly suggested that E-cadherin-mediated survival is achieved through Rb-mediated G1 arrest and precluded apoptosis. By inhibiting aggregation with an E-cadherin-blocking antibody, we found that the cells contained hyperphosphorylated Rb and remained in logarithmic growth at the time of PKC activation. Following activation of PKC, these non-aggregated cells rapidly converted Rb to the active, hypophosphorylated form that preceded a 3.5-fold increase in apoptosis. This result suggested that Rb activity was involved in signaling apoptosis in cycling cells. If aggregated, G1-arrested cells are able to suppress apoptosis, then in what phase of the cycle are cells susceptible to apoptotic signals? We determined that PKC-induced apoptosis occurred in the S phase of the cell cycle. This was demonstrated in two experiments in which we observed a dramatic reduction in viable S phase cells from asynchronous cultures and almost complete loss of cell viability in synchronized S phase cultures.The functional role of Rb is traditionally associated with cell cycle regulation; however, recent studies have accumulated significant data linking Rb activity with programmed cell death (44Wang H. Grand R.J.A. Milner A.E. Armitage R.J. Gordon J. Gregory C.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 373-379PubMed Google Scholar, 45Morana S.J. Wolf C.M. Li J. Reynolds J.E. Brown M.K. Eastman A. J. Biol.

Commun. 1998; 243: 852-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated a functional role for Rb in signaling apoptosis of epithelial cells induced by anchorage disruption or inducible overexpression and activation of PKCα (3Zhao X. Gschwend J.E. Powell C.T. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Day M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22751-22757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Day M.L. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Zhao X. Humphrey P. Swanson P. Postigo A.A. Zhang S.H. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8125-8128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the latter study, we demonstrated that Rb-signaled apoptosis was executed through the caspase family of cysteine proteases (3Zhao X. Gschwend J.E. Powell C.T. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Day M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22751-22757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); however, the exact mechanism by which Rb initiates this apoptotic response was unclear. Since a variety of regulatory signals from the extracellular environment are critically important in determining cell fate, we and others (26Evan G.L. Brown L. Whyte M. Harrinton Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) have hypothesized that opposing signals can arise in some cells, such as forced c-Myc expression in fibroblasts in the absence of serum growth factors, resulting in dysfunctional cell cycle and apoptosis. A similar conflict occurs in our model, one in which Rb activation provides a growth inhibitory signal in direct opposition to growth-promoting signals in proliferating cells. In support of this possibility we found previously that when this conflict was prevented by eliminating Rb function in Rb−/− cells or by transfection with the Rb inhibitory oncogene, E1a, apoptosis did not occur (see Ref. 25Day M.L. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Zhao X. Humphrey P. Swanson P. Postigo A.A. Zhang S.H. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8125-8128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and Fig.6 C). Although many aspects of PKC regulation of cellular differentiation and development are known, the mechanism by which PKC induces apoptosis in epithelial cells is not completely understood. The theory that defective developmental programs may precipitate some forms of apoptosis substantiates our observations that the rapid hypophosphorylation of Rb in S phase cells does not result in G1 arrest but leads to a fatal conflict of growth regulatory signals. These findings may begin to address inconsistencies surrounding the functional role of Rb in the regulation of programmed cell death. One view, strongly supported by RB knock-out studies, suggests that Rb may play a protective role in developing tissue by suppressing apoptotic programs (27Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 28Lee E.Y.-H.P. Chang C.-Y. Hu N. Wang Y.-C.J. Lai C.-C. Herrup K. Lee W.-H. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 29Clarke A.R. Maandag E.R. van Roon M. van der Lugt N.M. van der Valk M. Hooper M.L. Berns A. te Riele H.

A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We believe that Rb also has the capacity to initiate an apoptotic program, which results from conflicting growth regulatory signals in the cell. The results of this study may provide an explanation as to how Rb can regulate cell survival through the induction of G1 arrest. Alternatively, our results also suggest that Rb can initiate a cell death program when it is hypophosphorylated as cells enter S phase.Short term PKC activity is necessary for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (1Fishman D.D. Segal S. Livneh E. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar). However, sustained activation of PKC is thought to have oncogenic activity in various types of adenocarcinomas (47Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 411-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). E-cadherin, whose function is critical for epithelial differentiation, has also been implicated in tumorigenesis, specifically as a metastasis suppressor protein (48Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that the loss of E-cadherin is a common event in advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate (34Umbas R. Issacs W.B. Bringuier P.P. Schaafsma H.E. Karthaus H.F. Oosterhof G.O. Debruyne F.M. Schalken J.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3929-3933PubMed Google Scholar). In the mammary gland the same trend is prevalent; however, late stage or metastatic tumors exhibit some dependence on intercellular adhesion suggesting that the loss or gain of cell-cell adhesion during tumor progression is a regulated and dynamic process (20St. Croix B. Kerbel R.S. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1997; 9: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 36Berx G. Cleton-Jansen A.-M. Nollet F. de Leeuw W.J.F. van de Vijver M.J. Cornelisse C. van Roy F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6107-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Some of the genetic events that occur in prostate tumorigenesis involve alterations in cell death programs present in the normal, androgen-dependent prostate epithelium. One of the most common genetic alterations associated with prostate cancer is allelic loss at the RB locus as reported in 27–67% of prostate tumors examined (49Brooks J.D. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Prostate. 1995; 26: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 50Cooney K.A. Wetzel J.C. Merajver S.D. Macoska J.A. Singleton T.P. Wojno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1142-1145PubMed Google Scholar, 51Ittmann M.M. Wieczorek R. Hum. Pathol. 1996; 27: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); however, the pathobiological role of Rb in this disease has not been elucidated.Tumor suppression is achieved not only by cell cycle arrest but by the initiation of cell death programs as well. The role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product in apoptosis has been extensively documented in cells that are responding to DNA-damaging agents, chemotherapeutic agents, or in cells that have a deregulated cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 1Fishman D.D. Segal S. Livneh E. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar). Although Rb has been shown to inhibit multiple p53-dependent apoptotic pathways (1Fishman D.D. Segal S. Livneh E. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar, 23Peluso J.J. Pappalardo A. Trolice M.P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1196-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb leading to G1 arrest and apoptosis occurs in multiple p53-independent pathways as well (36Berx G. Cleton-Jansen A.-M. Nollet F. de Leeuw W.J.F. van de Vijver M.J. Cornelisse C. van Roy F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6107-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 37Pollack A. Ciancio G. Methods Cell Biol. 1990; 33: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two such p53-independent pathways are induced by release of the lipid second messenger ceramide (38Del Bino G. Lassota P. Darzynkiewicz Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 39Day M.L. Zhao X. Wu S. Swanson P. Humphrey P. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar) or by DNA-damaging agents (40English H.F. Santen R.J. Issacs J.T. Prostate. 1987; 11: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), both of which result in the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb, G1 arrest, and apoptosis. We have examined the contribution of p53 to apoptosis in the LNCaP model and have found that although p53 protein is rapidly induced 30–40-fold over basal expression following UV irradiation, there is absolutely no induction of p53 following PKC activation. 3M. L. Day, X. Zhao, C. J. Vallorosi, C. T. Powell, C. Lin, and K. C. Day, unpublished observations. Coupled to the observation that apoptosis occurs normally in androgen-dependent prostate epithelium of p53(−/−) mice following castration (41Guenette R.S. Corbeil H.B. Leger J. Wong K. Mezl V. Mooibroek M. Tenniswood M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 12: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) indicated that apoptosis in prostate epithelium is a p53-independent process. The ability of epithelial cells to survive and proliferate in the absence of extracellular contact is critical for tumor progression. We postulate that E-cadherin functions to monitor extracellular contact, which during differentiation or tumorigenesis may control contact-independent growth of autonomous cells by inducing apoptosis. Thus, the inactivation of the E-cadherin/Rb apoptotic pathway may be a critical regulatory control that is lost during the metastatic progression of epithelial tumors.Hormone ablation, by surgical or pharmacological castration, induces rapid involution of the prostate gland. This process involves extensive remodeling of the ductal architecture that regresses to an atrophic or underdeveloped state. The predominance of apoptotic cells observed in the luminal compartment 3–4 days following castration indicates that this regression results from programmed cell death of the luminal epithelium. The first visible stage of individual cell death is the loss of intercellular adhesion as the desmosomal contacts between the epithelial cells are lost prior to cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation (17Tenniswood M.P. Guenette R.S. Lakins J. Mooibroek M. Wong P. Welsh J.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We investigated whether an E-cadherin/Rb-regulated pathway was activated in the prostate gland following castration. Examination of E-cadherin expression and its cellular distribution following castration revealed a dramatic reduction in the junctional membranes prior to apoptosis. Previous studies have reported that the levels of prostatic cyclin D1 and E are reduced following castration (40English H.F. Santen R.J. Issacs J.T. Prostate. 1987; 11: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), suggesting that G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activity is diminished and that Rb is likely in the hypophosphorylated form. This observation that Rb was hypophosphorylated subsequent to the loss of E-cadherin and coincidental to the onset of apoptosis during involution of the prostate gland suggested that androgen ablation signals the same apoptotic pathway in epithelial cells as was observed in vitro.Considering the coordinated regulation between proliferation and cell death that"

Somatostatin potently inhibited growth of a Kaposi's sarcoma xenograft in nude mice, yet in vitro the tumor cells did not express any known somatostatin receptors and were not growth inhibited by somatostatin. Histological examination revealed limited vascularization in the somatostatin-treated tumors as compared with the controls. Somatostatin was a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in an in vivo assay. In vitro, somatostatin inhibited endothelial cell growth and invasion. Migration of monocytes, important mediators of the angiogenic cascade, was also inhibited by somatostatin. Both cells types expressed somatostatin receptor mRNAs. These data demonstrate that somatostatin is a potent antitumor angiogenesis compound directly affecting both endothelial and monocytic cells. The debated function of somatostatin in tumor treatment and the design of therapeutic protocols should be reexamined considering these data."

Treatment with H 212/43 increased the antioxidant capacity of plasma, as indicated by prolonged inhibition of peroxyl radical-induced, ex vivo lipid peroxidation. Aortic tissue from control apoE-/-;LDLr-/- mice contained lipid hydro(pero)xides and substantial atherosclerotic lesions, both of which were decreased strongly by supplementation of the animals with H 212/43. The results show that a coantioxidant effectively inhibits in vivo lipid peroxidation and atherosclerosis in apoE-/-;LDLr-/- mice, consistent with though not proving a causal relationship between aortic lipoprotein lipid oxidation and atherosclerosis in this model of the disease.—Witting, P.

Like paxillin, Hic-5 is localized in focal adhesion plaques in association with focal adhesion kinase in cultured fibroblasts. We carried out yeast two-hybrid screening to identify cellular factors that form a complex with Hic-5 using its LIM domains as a bait, and we identified a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase (PTP-PEST) as one of the partners of Hic-5. These two proteins are associated in mammalian cells. From in vitro binding experiments using deletion and point mutations, it was demonstrated that the essential domain in Hic-5 for the binding was LIM 3. As for PTP-PEST, one of the five proline-rich sequences found on PTP-PEST, Pro-2, was identified as the binding site for Hic-5 in in vitro binding assays. Paxillin also binds to the Pro-2 domain of PTP-PEST. In conclusion, Hic-5 may participate in the regulation of signaling cascade through its interaction with distinct tyrosine kinases and phosphatases.

Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its overexpression induced senescence-like phenotypes in immortalized fibroblasts (2Shibanuma M. Mochizuki M. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T. Oshimura M. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and promoted cellular differentiation process in cell lines such as osteoblasts (3Shibanuma M. Nose K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One of the unique features of the Hic-5 protein is its similarity to paxillin, especially in their C-terminal four LIM domains. Paxillin is a vinculin-binding protein co-localized with FAK1 and integrins in focal contacts (4Turner C.E. Glenney Jr., J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). It is a phosphoprotein that interacts with tyrosine kinases of the Src family as well as with focal adhesion kinase and vinculin at focal adhesions (4Turner C.E. Glenney Jr., J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The LIM domain is a unique cysteine-rich motif that defines a double zinc finger structure with a consensus sequence of (CXXCX 16–23HXXCXXCXXCX 16–21CXX(D/H/C)) and is found in a variety of proteins with diverse functions and subcellular distributions, including transcription factors, components of adhesion plaques, and the actin-based cytoskeleton (5Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbits T.N. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The members of LIM proteins can be classified into five groups as follows: LIM homeodomain, LIM only protein, LIM kinase, GTPase-activating protein family, and zyxin family including enigma, paxillin, and Hic-5 (5Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbits T.N. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence demonstrated that the LIM domains serve as an interface for protein-protein interactions (6Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), but the function of the LIM domains in the Hic-5 protein has not yet been determined. Recent immunocytochemical studies showed that the Hic-5 protein is localized in focal adhesions in rat fibroblasts (cell strain WFB) and associates with cell adhesion kinase-β (7Matsuya M. Sasaki H.

Focal adhesions are specialized sites of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, consisting of the integrins, cytoskeletal proteins, and signaling molecules such as protein-tyrosine kinases and small G proteins (8Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar, 9Burridge K. Cancer Rev. 1986; 4: 18-78Google Scholar, 10Clark J.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). Integrins are the transmembrane extracellular matrix receptors (11Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and the interaction of extracellular matrix and integrins elicits numerous cellular responses such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation (12Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 13Parson J.T. Curr. Opin.

Formation of focal adhesions thus plays a central role in these biological responses (15Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in the assembly of focal adhesions followed by transmission of extracellular stimuli (13Parson J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and protein-tyrosine kinases such as FAK (16Schaller M.D. Borman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Raymond A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that protein-tyrosine phosphatases such as PTEN (20Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S.-I. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1617-1624Crossref Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) and PTP-PEST 2A. Angers-Loustau, J. F. Côté, A. Charest, D. Dowbenko, S. Spencer, L. A. Lasky, and M. K.

Tremblay, manuscript submitted for publication. are also localized in the focal adhesion plaques. In the present communication, we describe evidence that PTP-PEST is associated with Hic-5 through its distinct LIM domains. The cDNA library for expression of fusion proteins in yeast was constructed using mRNA from differentiated mouse myogenic cells, C2C12 (21Blau H.M. Chiu C.-P. Webster C. Cell. 1983; 32: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cells that were cultured for 4 days in a differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% horse serum) by the guanidinium/hot phenol method (1Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by (dT)30latex (Oligotech™-dT30, Takara Shuzo, Co., Kyoto, Japan). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized by using the Two-hybrid cDNA Library Construction Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), according to the instruction manuals, and cloned into theEcoRI site of the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH). As a bait, a cDNA fragment that encodes the LIM domain of Hic-5 (amino acids 187–444) was ligated intoBamHI site of pGBT9 to express a fusion protein with GAL4 DNA binding domain. By using the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (CLONTECH), approximately 1 × 105independent clones were screened, and cDNA clones that interacted with the Hic-5 LIM domains were selected by growth on His-deficient plates. Positive clones were further screened for LacZ expression, and positive clones were then allowed to test their two plasmid dependencies. From 105 his+transformants, we obtained 16 interacting cDNA clones. These clones were sequenced using Cy5TM AutoReadTM Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc, Little Chalfont, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse myoblastic cells, C2C12, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml kanamycin under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Human immortalized fibroblasts, KMST-6 (42Namba M. Nishitani K. Fukushima F. Kimoto T. Int. J. Cancer. 1985; 35: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were passaged at 1:8 dilution when they became confluent. Cells were transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's manuals. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g, and the resultant lysates were analyzed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. The anti-mouse Hic-5 polyclonal antibody (number 1024) was raised against the recombinant Hic-5 N-terminal region (amino acids 2–194). The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) and the anti-HA antibody (12CA5) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. Immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged proteins and the Hic-5 were performed after covalent coupling of antibodies to protein A- or protein G-beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) with the chemical cross-linking agent dimethyl pimelimidate (22Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The covalently coupled antibody beads were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in the lysates. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed with the lysis buffer, and eluted with SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mdithiothreitol). For immunoblotting, cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked with bovine serum albumin and incubated with the anti-Hic-5 or the anti-HA antibody for 16 h. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and a chemiluminescent detection kit using (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To generate Hic-5 deletion mutants (LIM 1–3, LIM 1–2, LIM 1, and ΔLIM), Hic-5 cDNA on the CMV/S5 vector (1Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was truncated with restriction enzymes at thePmaCI site (nucleotide 1365), the BssHII site (nucleotide 1230), the BstPI site (nucleotide 1039), or theStuI site (nucleotide 822), respectively. To obtain other deletion constructs, a HindIII/XbaI-digested Hic-5 cDNA fragment from CMV/S5 was cloned into theHindIII/XbaI site of pVZ-1 vector (23Henikoff S. Eghtedarzadeh M. Genetics. 1987; 117: 711-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This construct was named pVZ-1/S5, digested with StuI andXbaI, and used as a primary vector. Desired fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of selected regions using primers incorporating 5′-StuI and 3′-XbaI restriction site. After restriction digestion, polymerase chain reaction products were introduced into theStuI/XbaI-digested primary vector. The mutant fragments were excised from pVZ-1/S5 vector with HindIII andXbaI and ligated into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pRC/CMV (Invitrogen). These deletion mutants lack the following nucleotide sequences of the Hic-5 cDNA; LIM 1–3 (nucleotides 165–1365), LIM 1–2 (nucleotides 165–1230), LIM 1 (nucleotides 165–1039), LIM 2–4 (nucleotides 165–822/982-1531), LIM 3–4 (nucleotides 165–822/1157–1531), LIM 3 (nucleotides 165–822/1157–1352), and LIM (nucleotides 165–822). The Hic-5 cDNA fragment was subcloned intoHindIII/XbaI sites of pKF 19k (Takara Shuzoh, Co., Kyoto) for site-directed mutagenesis. According to the instruction manual, the mutagenesis was performed with Takara's Mutan-Super Express Km Kit. The mutated fragments (mLIM 2 (H293L/C296G) and mLIM 3 (C352G/C355G)) were excised from the pKF 19k vector and subcloned into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pRc/CMV. An expression vector for PTP-PEST that was defective in the Pro-2 domain (HA-ΔPro-2) was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The PEP construct, PEP CL3/pBluescript, was provided by Dr. Kiminori Hasegawa (Department of Immunology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Neuroscience, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan). To construct a prokaryotic expression vector encoding the GST fusion protein of PTP-PEST (GST-PEST-185–433) including amino acids 185–433, the EcoRI fragment cut out from the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH) containing PTP-PEST cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI site of pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Other PTP-PEST GST fusion proteins have been previously described (24Charest A. Wagner J. Kwan M.K. Tremblay M.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein was expressed inEscherichia coli strain DH5α. The fusion proteins were expressed by incubation of E. coli harboring expression vectors with 1 mmisopropyl–d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation, lysed by sonication, and solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Labeled Hic-5 and paxillin were synthesized in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]Met using pRc/S5 (1Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pRc/CMV/paxillin (25Nishiya N. Sabe H. Nose K. Shibanuma M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4267-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as templates. In vitro translated products were then incubated with immobilized GST fusion proteins in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 mmZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 10 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with the wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1m KCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The protein complexes were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m KCl, 20 mm glutathione) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After drying, the gels were exposed to x-ray films. Flag-tagged Hic-5 mutants of the LIM domains (mLIM 1, mLIM 2, and mLIM 3) were inserted into pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.) and co-transfected with HA-tagged PTP-PEST into KMST-6 human fibroblasts by calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were collected 24 h after transfection, and their association was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag and Western blotting with anti-HA as described above. Cells were transfected with Flag-tagged Hic-5 mutants into KMST-6 cells by calcium phosphate method and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after the transfection. Cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, treated with monoclonal anti-Flag antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h, and then treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. After extensive washing, cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope. To investigate the molecular basis of Hic-5-mediated cellular functions, we attempted to isolate interacting proteins of Hic-5 with the yeast two-hybrid system (26Chien C.-T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). As previously reported, the Hic-5 levels decreased in the most immortalized cell lines (1Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but mouse myoblastic cells, C2C12, express significant amounts of Hic-5. The cDNA library was constructed with mRNA from C2C12 cells and screened using the LIM domain of Hic-5 as a bait. Sequences of 5 clones out of 16 positives were 100% identical to a part of a previously cloned cDNA, murine protein-tyrosine phosphatase-PEST (PTP-PEST) (27Takekawa M. Itoh Y. Arimura Y. Toyota M. Sekiya M. Adachi M. Imai K. Yachi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Yang Q. Co D. Sommercorn J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6622-6628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.-H. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30den Hertog J. Pals C.E.G.M. Jonk L.J.C. Kruijer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The longest cDNA contained amino acids 185–433 and the shortest one 212–420 of PTP-PEST. It is a ubiquitously expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase that is composed of an N-terminal phosphatase domain and a C-terminal noncatalytic region. The cDNA fragments isolated from the two-hybrid screening contained a part of a catalytic domain and proline-rich domains. To confirm that these two are associated in mammalian cells, we introduced expression vectors of HA-tagged PTP-PEST into the C2C12 cells, and we examined their binding by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The N-terminal HA-tagged PTP-PEST (29Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.-H. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or its mutant (C231S) in which a cysteine residue in the active center was converted to serine residue was transiently expressed in C2C12 cells, and then endogenous Hic-5 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Hic-5 antibody (number 1024). HA-PTP-PEST or HA-C231S was co-immunoprecipitated with Hic-5 (Fig.1 A), showing their in vivo association. In the immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody (12CA5), Hic-5 was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-PTP-PEST or HA-C231S (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, the interaction of Hic-5 to wild type PTP-PEST and to mutant C231S were almost at similar levels. HA-C231S has a point mutation in the catalytic domain that can stably bind the substrates, but more investigation will be required to eliminate the possibility that Hic-5 is a substrate of PTP-PEST. One of the isolated clones of PTP-PEST encoded the amino acid residues 185–433 encompassing the C-terminal portion of the catalytic domain and the N-terminal region of the noncatalytic domain that includes Pro-1 and Pro-2 domains. In the noncatalytic domain, PTP-PEST has five proline-rich domains (Fig.2 A). These domains have been shown to provide the interface for interacting with Src homology domain 3-containing signal transduction molecules. In order to identify the domain responsible for association with Hic-5, we performed GST affinity matrix binding assay using a series of GST fusions of Pro-rich domains derived from PTP-PEST (Fig. 2 A). The fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with35S-labeled Hic-5 produced by in vitrotranslation. The proteins bound to the beads were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray film. The result demonstrated that the Hic-5 preferentially binds to the GST-Pro-2 domain, whereas Pro-1, and Pro-3–5 showed essentially no binding activity (Fig. 2, Band C). A fusion protein of the Pro-2 domain showed unusual mobility on SDS-PAGE, but it is generally accepted that Pro-rich peptides migrate unpredictably. Furthermore, all constructs have been sequenced, and we are sure that they encode for the proper proteins (36Côté J.F. Charest A. Wagner J. Tremblay M.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13128-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Paxillin also bound to the Pro-2 domain of PTP-PEST. The Hic-5 C-terminal region used as a bait contains four LIM domains. Because a single LIM domain can act as a protein association interface (5Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbits T.N. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), we tried to map the LIM domain(s) required for binding to PTP-PEST. The binding assay was carried out using GST fusion protein of PTP-PEST isolated from two-hybrid screening and35S-labeled Hic-5 deletion mutants. Since both LIM 1–3 and LIM 3–4 could bind to PTP-PEST, LIM 1, LIM 2, and LIM 4 are not necessary for the association (Fig. 3,A and B). These data indicate that LIM 3 of Hic-5 is important for interaction with PTP-PEST. However, the Hic-5 mutant containing only LIM 3 could not bind to PTP-PEST (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that LIM 3 alone is not sufficient for the binding. It is most likely that each LIM may affect the structural stability of adjacent LIMs or functions cooperatively. To ascertain the requirement of LIM 3 for binding to PTP-PEST, we introduced two point mutations in LIM 2 or LIM 3 by site-directed mutagenesis. A single LIM motif is composed of two zinc fingers with the following consensus sequence: CX 2CX 16–23HX 2CX 2CX 2CX 16–21CX 2(C/H/D). Each zinc finger is folded into its ternary structure chelating a zinc ion via conserved cysteine, histidine, or aspartate residues, and the introduction of point mutations in zinc-chelating residues can disrupt the ternary folding of LIM structure (31Feuerstein R. Wang X. Song D. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10655-10659Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The mutants used here, mLIM 2(H293L/C296G) and mLIM 3(H352G/C355G), contained point mutations at zinc-chelating residues within both the first and second zinc fingers, disrupting the structure of an individual LIM domain. We performed the binding assay using these mutants and a GST fusion Pro-2 domain of PTP-PEST as a GST matrix (Fig. 3 C). In contrast to the mLIM 2 protein that bound to PTP-PEST efficiently, mLIM 3 did not show any binding activity. This indicates that the LIM 3 domain of Hic-5 is essential to associate with PTP-PEST. Taken together with the above results, we concluded that Hic-5 and PTP-PEST associate through LIM 3 domain and Pro-2 domain, respectively, in vitro. We also examined the specificity of interaction between Hic-5 and PTP-PEST by comparing to another protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PEP (32Mathews R.J. Bowne D.B. Flores E. Thomas M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). PEP is a nonreceptor type PTP with similar structure to PTP-PEST, and we performed in vitro binding assay using a GST fusion protein of the LIM domains of Hic-5 and 35S-labeled PEP. LIM domains of Hic-5 failed to bind to PEP (data not shown), suggesting that these LIM domains have binding selectivity to a certain type of PTPs. The above results show that LIM 3 of Hic-5 and Pro-2 of PTP-PEST specifically bind each other in vitro, but their in vivo association was examined by transfection of each expression vectors. In Fig. 4 A, plasmids that express HA-tagged full-length PTP-PEST or its Pro-2 deletion mutant (ΔPro-2) were introduced into C2C12 cells. Cell lysates were treated with anti-Hic-5 to precipitate endogenous Hic-5, and the precipitates were Western-blotted with anti-HA antibody. The results clearly indicate that Pro-2 deletion mutant did not associate with Hic-5. Next we transfected human fibroblastic KMST-6 cells with Flag-tagged Hic-5 mutants together with HA-PTP-PEST. This cell line was chosen, because of its low level of endogenous Hic-5 that would interfere with interaction of exogenously expressed products. Cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and Western-blotted with anti-Hic-5 antibody. In contrast to the results obtained from in vitro binding assay, the results shown in Fig. 4 Bindicate that Hic-5 with point mutation either in LIM 1, LIM 2, or LIM 3 formed a complex with HA-tagged PTP-PEST. This may result from the presence of other factors that bridge between Hic-5 and PTP-PEST through other domains. It is reported that the LIM 3 of paxillin determines its localization to focal adhesion (38Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and subcellular localization of Hic-5 with mutations at the LIM domains was examined using Flag-tagged Hic-5 expressing either wild type or mutated LIMs. KMST-6 cells were transfected with pRc/CMV-based expression vectors, and cells were fixed 24 h later for immunostaining with anti-Flag antibody (Fig.5, A–D). The results show that wild type Hic-5 localized in focal adhesion, but the mutant in LIM 3 completely lost this phenotype (Fig. 5 D). Localization of the mutants at LIM 1 and LIM 2 in focal adhesion seemed weakened (Fig.5, B and C) compared with that of wild type Hic-5. Involvement of PTP-PEST for subcellular localization of Hic-5 was tested using fibroblasts from PTP-PEST(+/−) and (−/−) mice. An expression vector of HA-tagged Hic-5 was introduced into embryo fibroblasts, and localization of Hic-5 was observed by staining with anti-HA antibody. Comparison of Fig. 5, E and F,indicates that Hic-5 localized in focal adhesion both in PTP-PEST(+/−) and (−/−) cells, but Hic-5 seems mainly localize in stress fibers in (−/−) cells. Hic-5, a member of LIM proteins, has been shown to be involved in cellular senescence and differentiation processes (2Shibanuma M. Mochizuki M. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms for its biological effects have been remained unsolved, whereas its localization in focal adhesion (7Matsuya M. Sasaki H. Aoto H. Mitaka T. Nagura K. Ohba T. Ishino M. Takahashi S. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar) suggested to us that Hic-5 has some roles in modulating integrin-mediated signal. In this study, we isolated the Hic-5 interacting factors using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified PTP-PEST/P19-PTP, which is a member of the intracellular PTP family, as one of such factors. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the most important entities constituting signal transduction pathways from cell surface to the nucleus in response to various extracellular stimuli (33Gould K.L. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation increases not only upon stimuli with soluble factors, such as growth factors, but also upon cell adhesion to extracellular substrate (34Guan J.-L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Many molecules are now known to be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon cell adhesion events and thought to function in transmitting the signal emanating from integrins, which have no intrinsic tyrosine-phosphorylating activity, to the nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 12Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 13Parson J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 14Giancotti F.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 15Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). For example, paxillin and FAK are tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of integrin signals (19Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar,34Guan J.-L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is so critical that its level should be tightly regulated by the balanced activities of protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. Thus, like protein-tyrosine kinases, PTPs are important molecules in controlling the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. PTP-PEST (also known as P19-PTP) is a member of the intracellular PTP family and is characterized by the presence of several PEST motifs in the carboxyl segment of the protein adjacent to the catalytic domain (26Chien C.-T.

In addition, its C terminus contains five proline-rich segments (29Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.-H. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At least two of these domains represent type 2 proline-rich consensus segments known to interact with Src homology domain 3 motif. To date, several molecules have been identified to interact with PTP-PEST, including adaptor proteins such as SHC (35Charest A. Wagner J. Jacob S. McGlade C.J. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8424-8429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and Grb2 (24Charest A. Wagner J. Kwan M.K. Tremblay M.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The recent study using fibroblasts derived from PTP-PEST knock-out mice has identified p130Cas as one of the downstream targets of PTP-PEST (36Côté J.F. Charest A. Wagner J. Tremblay M.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13128-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cas is localized in focal adhesions (37Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), as well as PTP-PEST following cell adhesion to fibronectin and concomitant engagement of integrins (2Shibanuma M. Mochizuki M. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T. Oshimura M. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is plausible that the PTP-PEST interacting factors including Hic-5 modulate such PTP-PEST activity or substrate specificity, thereby contributing to signal transduction in focal adhesions. From the series of experiments using various types of mutant proteins, we concluded that Hic-5 interacts with the Pro-2 domain of PTP-PEST by LIM 3 in vitro as summarized in Fig. 6. On the other hand, the results obtained from in vivo binding assay shown in Fig.4 B indicate that Hic-5 with point mutation either in LIM 1, LIM 2, or LIM 3 formed a complex with HA-tagged PTP-PEST. This may result from the presence of another factor that bridges between Hic-5 and PTP-PEST through other domains. The LIM domains of Hic-5 are very similar to those of paxillin, and overall sequence similarity of amino acids in the LIM domains of Hic-5 and paxillin is 68%. In particular, similarity is as high as 74% in LIM 3. Therefore LIM 3 domains of both proteins possibly bear the similar function. We have shown that the LIM 3 of Hic-5 is the binding site for PTP-PEST, and the LIM 3 of paxillin is known to participate in localization of the protein to focal adhesion (38Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Besides, both Hic-5 and paxillin are actually localized at focal adhesions and bind to PTP-PEST. Taken together, an interesting possibility is raised that LIM 3 is the determinant of subcellular localization of Hic-5 and paxillin and that PTP-PEST participates in recruiting them to focal adhesions by binding to LIM 3 of both proteins. The results of Fig. 5,A–D, however, suggest that the LIM domains other than LIM 3 may be involved in localization in focal adhesion. These possibilities are an open question for future study. N-terminal regions of Hic-5 and paxillin are also very similar in structure, although their similarity is less than in LIM domains. The regions contain Pro-rich and LD domains, which are thought to serve as an interface for protein-protein interaction. In fact FAK, proline-rich kinase 2, and vinculin have been shown to bind to the N-terminal regions of paxillin (39Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Fujita et al. (40Fujita H. Kamiguchi K. Cho D. Shibanuma M. Morimoto C. Tachibana K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26516-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) recently reported that Hic-5 associates with FAK at the N-terminal domain. Collectively, Hic-5 and paxillin are closely related proteins in many aspects, such as structures, interacting factors, and subcellular localization. However, they are expected to have different functions within cells, since their expression patterns are different; paxillin is ubiquitously expressed, whereas Hic-5 is expressed higher in spleen and lung (1Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At molecular levels, Fujita et al. (40Fujita H. Kamiguchi K. Cho D. Shibanuma M. Morimoto C. Tachibana K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26516-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have clearly demonstrated the differences between Hic-5 and paxillin. They have shown that Hic-5 is marginally tyrosine-phosphorylated either by FAK kinase activity or by integrin stimulation, which forms sharp contrast to paxillin that is heavily phosphorylated by either pathway. This result is consistent with the fact that Hic-5 does not have several tyrosine residues that are present in paxillin and are supposed to be binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain and potentially phosphorylated (40Fujita H. Kamiguchi K. Cho D. Shibanuma M. Morimoto C. Tachibana K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26516-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Of interest is that fibronectin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was inhibited by co-expression of Hic-5 (40Fujita H. Kamiguchi K. Cho D. Shibanuma M. Morimoto C. Tachibana K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26516-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). From these observations, they proposed that one of putative Hic-5 functions is to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin by binding to protein-tyrosine kinases such as FAK in a competitive manner to paxillin. Recent findings by Shen et al. (41Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) indicated that paxillin associates with PTP-PEST through the region of 297–494 amino acids encompassing Pro-1 and Pro-2. Although the precise mapping of the interacting domain of PTP-PEST with paxillin has not been yet performed, it is likely that Hic-5 binding to Pro-2 competes out paxillin, resulting in inhibition of the signaling directed by the complex of PTP-PEST and paxillin as is the case of protein-tyrosine kinases. In conclusion Hic-5 shares structural features, subcellular localization, and interacting factors with paxillin. FAK and PYK2 have been reported to bind to both Hic-5 and paxillin. In this study we added PTP-PEST to the list. All of these molecules are implicated in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and are believed to have important functions in integrin-mediated signal transduction pathway. Hic-5 is thought to compete with paxillin in the binding to these molecules and thus control tyrosine phosphorylation signaling mediated by paxillin. Further study on Hic-5 functions is expected to clarify the nature of integrin-mediated signaling in more detail and the way it is involved in various types of cellular processes."

Biochemical studies have demonstrated that some RGS members (RGS1, RGS4, RGS10, GAIP, RGSr/RGS16, RET-RGS1) function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for the Gi family of α subunit, including Gαo, Gαi, and transducin (10Chen C.-M.

Hence, these characterized RGS proteins are proposed to down-regulate G protein signaling in vivo by enhancing the rate of Gα GTP hydrolysis. However, whether other RGS proteins regulate G protein signalings in a similar manner remains to be established.Because there are many G protein signaling pathways which regulate important functions such as neural transmission in the brain, it is possible that certain RGS proteins might determine a mode of G protein signaling that control neural functions. We searched RGS proteins specifically expressed in neural cells using neuronally differentiating P19 cells in culture. RGS8 was induced in neuronally differentiated P19 cells. Biochemical studies indicated that RGS8 functions as a GAP for Gαo and Gαi3.To examine effects of RGS8 on G protein signaling, we co-expressed a G protein-coupled receptor and a G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK1/2) (21Kubo Y.

We found that RGS8 significantly accelerates both turning on and off (24Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Do other neural-tissue-specific RGS proteins function in a similar manner ? RGS4 and RGS7 have been reported to be expressed predominantly in the brain (8Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R.

We determined distribution of RGS7 mRNA and binding character of the core domain of RGS7 and analyzed effects of RGS7 on turning on and turning off kinetics of GIRK current. Numerous extracellular signals such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and odors stimulate seven transmembrane-spanning receptors that activate heterotrimeric G proteins.

Biochemical studies have demonstrated that some RGS members (RGS1, RGS4, RGS10, GAIP, RGSr/RGS16, RET-RGS1) function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for the Gi family of α subunit, including Gαo, Gαi, and transducin (10Chen C.-M.

Hence, these characterized RGS proteins are proposed to down-regulate G protein signaling in vivo by enhancing the rate of Gα GTP hydrolysis. However, whether other RGS proteins regulate G protein signalings in a similar manner remains to be established. Because there are many G protein signaling pathways which regulate important functions such as neural transmission in the brain, it is possible that certain RGS proteins might determine a mode of G protein signaling that control neural functions. We searched RGS proteins specifically expressed in neural cells using neuronally differentiating P19 cells in culture. RGS8 was induced in neuronally differentiated P19 cells. Biochemical studies indicated that RGS8 functions as a GAP for Gαo and Gαi3.To examine effects of RGS8 on G protein signaling, we co-expressed a G protein-coupled receptor and a G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK1/2) (21Kubo Y.

In order to dissect the contribution of gp130 and LIFRα individually, chimeric molecules consisting of the extracellular domain of the granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor (GCSF-R) and various mutant forms of the cytoplasmic domains of gp130 or LIFRα were expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells to test for suppression of differentiation, or in a factor-dependent plasma cytoma cell line to assess for induction of proliferation. Carboxyl-terminal domains downstream of the phosphatase (SHP2)-binding sites were dispensable for mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and the transduction of proliferative signals. Moreover, carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants which lacked intact Box 3 homology domains showed decreased STAT3 activation, failed to induce Hck kinase activity and suppress ES cell differentiation. Moreover, STAT3 antisense oligonucleotides impaired LIF-dependent inhibition of differentiation. Substitution of the tyrosine residue within the Box 3 region of the GSCF-R abolished receptor-mediated suppression of differentiation without affecting the transduction of proliferative signals. Thus, distinct cytoplasmic domains within the LIFRα, gp130, and GCSF-R transduce proliferative and differentiation suppressing signals.

The type I cytokine receptor superfamily is characterized by conserved cysteine residues and the presence of a tryptophan-serine-X-tryptophan-serine (WSXWS) motif in the extracellular domain (1Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). Weak sequence similarity between individual members of the type I receptor family extends into the membrane-proximal Box 1 and Box 2 homology regions of the cytoplasmic domain (2O'Neal K.D.

Box 1 and Box 2 homology regions associate constitutively with Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) and are indispensable for ligand-mediated JAK activation (4Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of the IL6 signal-transducing subunit, gp130, the ligand-binding subunit of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFRα), the granulocyte CSF receptor (GCSF-R), and the receptor for thrombopoietin (c-Mpl) has revealed an additional region of homology (Box 3) which is specific to gp130, LIFRα, and GCSF-R but not found in c-Mpl (5Baumann H.

Mutational analysis revealed that the Box 3 homology region is required for the induction of some specific biological responses, such as activation of acute-phase protein expression in transfected liver cells, thereby suggesting that distinct regions of the cytoplasmic domain may be required for the induction of specific biological responses (5Baumann H.

Trends Biochem. 1992; 17: 72-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In some cases, opposing biological responses are triggered by the LIF/IL6 cytokine family such as the induction of differentiation in myeloid leukemia M1 cells and the suppression of differentiation in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Thus, it has been proposed that cellular responses may be the consequence of gene expression programs elicited by an array of different, and sometimes cell type-specific intracellular signaling cascades, generated by the receptors for IL2, GCSF, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (8Sato N.

However, in all cell types investigated, binding of LIF to its ligand-binding chain, LIFRα, results in the formation of a heterodimeric receptor complex with gp130 which in turn triggers the activation of gp130-associated JAKs and other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (11Davis S.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30136-30143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In ES cells, ostensibly identical signaling events are initiated following IL6-induced homodimerization of gp130 molecules leading to activation of JAK family members Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, as well as of the Src-related tyrosine kinase Hck (14Ernst M.

Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1701-1706Crossref Scopus (864) Google Scholar). The kinases are thought to undergo autophosphorylation and at least Jak1 has been shown to subsequently phosphorylate tyrosine residues on gp130 and LIFRα (12Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T. Yasukawa K. Yamanishi K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1993; 260: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 13Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Yp N.Y. Davis S.

In turn, the phosphotyrosine residues on the cytokine receptors recruit various Src homology (SH2) domain-containing intermediate signal transducing molecules which often result in their subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. Two such molecules, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and the latent signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), are phosphotyrosine binding partners for gp130 and LIFRα (16Boulton T.G. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11648-11655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sadowski H.B. Suhat K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 26: 1744-1749Google Scholar), which contain 6 and 5 tyrosine residues in their respective cytoplasmic domains (15Stahl N. Farrugella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the case of gp130 and LIFRα, activation of STAT3 depends on phosphorylation of the most carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues while a different, more membrane-proximal located phosphotyrosine residue is required for activation of SHP2 (15Stahl N.

In gp130 and LIFRα, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 appears dependent on the presence of phosphotyrosine residues with a glutamine at position +3 relative to the tyrosine (YXXQ) thereby contrasting the sequence requirement for the activation of SHP2 which requires a valine at position +3 (YXXV) (15Stahl N.

The relative specificity of STAT activation by individual cytokine receptors prompted the notion that individual STAT family members determine the specificity of signal transduction from a particular cytokine receptor. Support for this view has recently been provided by genetic deletion studies in mice which point to a critical role for STAT1 in the innate immunity elicited by interferon-α and -γ (22Durbin J.E.

To this end, we expressed chimeric receptor constructs in which the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gp130, LIFRα, or GCSF-R were fused to the extracellular domain of the GCSF-R. This approach permits GCSF-dependent homodimerization of chimeric receptor subunits independent of the corresponding endogenous receptor chains (5Baumann H. Ziegler S.F. Mosley B. Morella K.K.

Our results demonstrate that carboxyl-terminal truncations or mutation of specific tyrosine residues within Box 3-containing receptor chains have no effect on the transduction of proliferative signals, while reducing the capacity to suppress ES cell differentiation. This response correlates with a decrease in Hck kinase activity and STAT3 phosphorylation. A critical role for STAT3 is supported by our finding that the presence of STAT3 antisense (AS)-oligonucleotides impairs the differentiation-inhibiting activity of full-length gp130 and LIFRα chains on ES cells in vitro.DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrate that the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic region of gp130 and LIFRα are required for regulation of mitogenic activity while the membrane-distal region with an intact Box 3 homology motif is critical for suppressing differentiation of ES cells in vitro. This observation correlates with ligand-dependent activation of Hck kinase and STAT3 phosphorylation and, unlike the transduction of mitogenic signal, is selectively impaired in the presence of STAT3 AS oligonucleotides. Therefore, our data support findings by Niwa et al. (32Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A.

Signaling by most type I cytokine receptors depends minimally on the Box 1 motif which is required for the association with JAKs. Transduction of mitogenic signals from the GCSF-R (36Ziegler F.F.

In particular, phosphorylation of SHP2 via the YXXV motif, which is located distal to the Box 2 and proximal to the Box 3 motif in gp130, is absolutely required for mitogenesis in Ba/F03 cells (27Fukada T.

We extend these findings here by identifying the carboxyl-terminal regions of gp130 and LIFRα as sites required for the induction of ligand-dependent Hck activation. While the molecular nature of this interaction remains to be established, the absence of conspicuous cysteine residues in gp130 and LIFRα suggests a different mechanism to that identified between the Src family kinase Lck and the T-cell co-receptors CD4/CD8 (39Turner J.M.

The present study suggests a correlation between gp130/LIFRα-mediated Hck activation and suppression of ES cell differentiation. Furthermore, GCSF-R dependent activation of the Src-related kinase Lyn (40Tweardy D.J. Wright T.M. Ziegler S.F. Baumann H. Chakraborty A. White S.M. Dyer K.F. Rubin K.A.

Ernst, unpublished observation.suggests that Src kinases may amplify signals that suppress ES cell differentiation.Specificity of the JAK-STAT pathway is controlled at the level of JAK kinase engagement (14Ernst M.

Receptor phosphotyrosine-independent STAT5 activation and cell type-specific differences in STAT expression patterns may therefore account for the fact that the truncated G/gp130Δ130Freceptor induced growth of the plasmacytome cell line 7-TD1 but only induced a transient mitogenic signal in the pro-B cell line Ba/F03 (27Fukada T.

In fact, STAT5 activation is required for maximal proliferation in response to IL2 receptor activation (45Friedmannm M.C. Migone T.S. Russel S.M. Leonard W.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2077-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and we found in 7-TD1 cells weak tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5a with all truncated chimeric gp130 and LIFRα constructs (data not shown).Based on the severity of the phenotype observed in mice with deletions for either STAT3 or gp130, STAT3 appears to be a crucial signaling intermediate for a number of growth factor and cytokine receptors in addition to those for the LIF/IL6 cytokine family. STAT3 plays an important role in self-renewal of lymphocytes (46Karras J.G. Wang Z. Huo L. Howard R.G. Frank D.A. Rothstein T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and is critically involved in transducing some of the biological responses of the LIF/IL6 cytokine family, including IL6-induced terminal differentiation, growth arrest, and macrophage differentiation of myeloid leukemia M1 cells (18Yamanaka Y.

Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Similarly, phenylalanine substitutions or deletions of all YXXQ motifs in gp130 or LIFRα, respectively, abolish the ligand-dependent transduction of differentiation promoting signals in M1 cells and the induction of acute-phase proteins in hepatoma cells (5Baumann H. Ziegler S.F. Mosley B. Morella K.K. Pajovic S. Gearing D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8414-8417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the presence of a single YXXQ motif retained ligand-dependent differentiation in M1 cells, but not β-fibrinogen expression in HepG2 cells (5Baumann H. Ziegler S.F. Mosley B. Morella K.K. Pajovic S. Gearing D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8414-8417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to IL6, STAT3 activation occurs rapidly and transiently in ES and HepG2 cells but persists for more than 24 h in M1 cells (26Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The sustained nature of STAT3 activity may be important in causing growth arrest and terminal differentiation, as in the case of sustained MAPK activation in nerve growth factor-induced PC12 cell differentiation (47Qui M.S. Green H.S. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and gp130-mediated prevention of ES cell differentiation (14Ernst M. Oates A. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30136-30143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Gp130 and LIFRα-dependent STAT3 activation requires at least one YXXQ consensus motif (51Ernst M. Gearing D.P. Dunn A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1574-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Two of these motifs in gp130 (pY126RHQ and pY173FKQ) mediate activation of STAT3 while the other two motifs (pY265LPQ and pY275MPQ) are capable of mediating the activation of STAT3 and STAT1 (48Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, substitution of the tyrosine residue in the truncated G/gp130Δ130Freceptor blunts the ligand-dependent formation of the SIF-A, SIF-B, and SIF-C DNA-binding complexes (Fig. 5 and Ref. 19Lai C.-F.

STAT1 appears to be a minor component of the total STAT proteins activated by gp130. It is therefore difficult to assess the role of STAT1 in ES cell directly, because (as observed in M1 cells) STAT1 activity is weak and only detected when STAT3 is highly activated. STAT3-dependent induction of M1 cell differentiation and suppression of Ba/F03 cell apoptosis appears to be independent of the number and position of these motifs in gp130 (18Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M.

In ES cells, however, a single YXXQ motif outside of the Box 3 motif (G/LIFRαΔ136, G/mpl) failed to suppress differentiation, while the single YXXQ motif within the Box 3 homology domain (G/gp130Δ156) partially retained the activity in ES cells. These findings are reminiscent of observations that only Box 3 containing receptors, but not c-Mpl, induced transcriptional activation of acute-phase protein genes (5Baumann H. Ziegler S.F. Mosley B. Morella K.K. Pajovic S. Gearing D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8414-8417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The presence of the common Box 3 motif in the cytoplasmic domain of GCSF-R, LIFRα, and gp130 is likely to contribute to the remarkably similar pattern of biological activities transduced in a number of cell systems (4Ihle J.N.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), the natural agonists, bind and activate the receptor leading to cyclic GMP production. This receptor has been reported to be spontaneously dimeric or oligomeric. In response to agonists, the KHD-mediated guanylate cyclase repression is removed, and it is assumed that ATP binds to the KHD. Since NPR-A displays a pair of juxtamembrane cysteines separated by 8 residues, we hypothesized that the removal of one of those cysteines would leave the other unpaired and reactive, thus susceptible to form an interchain disulfide bridge and to favor the dimeric interactions. Here we show that NPR-AC423S mutant, expressed mainly as a covalent dimer, increases the affinity of pBNP for this receptor by enhancing a high affinity binding component. Dimerization primarily depends on ECD since a secreted NPR-A C423S soluble ectodomain (ECDC423S) also documents a covalent dimer. ANP binding to the unmutated ECD yields up to 80-fold affinity loss as compared with the membrane receptor. However, the ECD C423S mutation restores a high binding affinity. Furthermore, C423S mutation leads to cellular constitutive activation (20–40-fold) of basal catalytic production of cyclic GMP by the full-length mutant. In vitro particulate guanylyl cyclase assays demonstrate that NPR-AC423S displays an increased sensitivity to ATP treatment alone and that the effect of ANP + ATP joint treatment is cumulative instead of synergistic. Finally, the cellular and particulate guanylyl cyclase assays indicate that the receptor is desensitized to agonist stimulation. We conclude the following: 1) dimers are functional units of NPR-A guanylyl cyclase activation; and 2) agonists are inducing dimeric contact of the juxtamembranous region leading to the removal of the KHD-mediated guanylyl cyclase repression, hence allowing catalytic activation.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 553-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Three different subtypes of natriuretic peptide receptors have been identified. Two of these receptors, NPR-A and NPR-B, represent fully functional particulate guanylyl cyclases. They respond to natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, and CNP) by catalyzing the intracellular production of cGMP. NPR-A is stimulated by both ANP and BNP, whereas NPR-B is stimulated by CNP (1Chinkers M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 553-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Nakao K. Ogawa Y. Shin-ichi S. Imura H. J.

North Am. 1995; 24: 481-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cGMP is mediating the effects of NPRs on diuresis, vasorelaxation, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (1Chinkers M.

North Am. 1995; 24: 481-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The third receptor, called NPR-C or the clearance receptor, has only a small intracellular domain lacking the guanylyl cyclase function. NPR-C is a disulfide-bridged dimer that has nearly equal binding affinity for all natriuretic peptides (4Itakura M. Iwashina M. Mizuno T. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8314-8318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Suga S. Nakao K. Hosada K. Mukoyama M. Ogawa Y. Shirakami G. Arai H. Saito Y. Kambayashi Y. Inouye K. Imura H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 229-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor internalizes natriuretic peptides through a fast intracellular cycle process (6Cohen D. Koh G.Y. Nikonova L.N. Porter J.G. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9863-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and might also be involved in signal transduction (7Anand-Shrivastava M.B. Sehl P.D. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19324-19329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). NPR-A is a ∼130-kDa protein that displays a typical particulate guanylyl cyclase structure with four structural domains as follows: an extracellular domain (ECD) with a ligand-binding site, a transmembrane domain, a kinase homology domain (KHD), and a guanylyl cyclase domain (GC) (1Chinkers M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 553-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The current model for ligand activation of NPRs includes concerted natriuretic peptide and ATP-dependent regulation of guanylyl cyclase activity (8Jewett J.R.S. Koller K.J. Goeddel D.V. Lowe D.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). According to this model, the signal transduction occurs through five sequential steps. 1) The binding of the natriuretic peptide to ECD induces a conformational change. 2) This modification corresponds to a signal that migrates through the transmembrane domain. 3) The KHD responds to this signal by adopting a conformation that allows ATP binding. 4) ATP binding has two major effects in derepressing the guanylyl cyclase activity and increasing the off-rate of ANP from the receptor. 5) Subsequent desensitization results from reduction in phosphorylation state of the KHD (9Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several authors (10Nakane M. Arai K. Saheki S. Kuno T. Buechler W. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16841-16845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Harteneck C. Koesling D. Soling A. Sclutz G. Bohme F.

Commun. 1991; 174: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) initially hypothesized that the guanylyl cyclase activity of NPRs must require at least receptor dimerization. This anticipation was based on the observation that adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases require two catalytic subunits for activity. In addition, x-ray crystallographic studies and modeling have established that both subunits contribute to the catalytic domain of these cyclases (13Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Another important observation was provided by cross-linking studies of ANP on NPR-A which demonstrated that high affinity binding is associated with receptor dimers (14Meloche S. McNicoll N. Liu B. Ong H. De Léan A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8151-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hence, one can reasonably think that NPR-A dimer constitutes a basic functional unit for guanylyl cyclase activity. Other studies have demonstrated the occurrence of spontaneous (ligand-independent) NPR-A non-covalent dimers or oligomers. For instance, co-immunoprecipitation studies of hNPRA constructs tagged with different epitopes led to identification of spontaneously formed dimers (15Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, two studies have described ligand-independent disulfide-bridged NPR-A tetramers (16Iwata T. Uchida-Mizuno K. Katafuchi T. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Lowe D.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10421-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Iwataet al. (16Iwata T. Uchida-Mizuno K. Katafuchi T. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) detected the presence of cross-linked tetramers in membrane preparations from bovine adrenal cortex. It was argued, however, that such disulfide linkage may arise from an artifact of preparation (15Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another study identified covalently linked tetramers in HEK 293 cells stably expressing hNPR-A and determined that the intracellular part of the molecule was essential for the linkage (17Lowe D.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10421-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Another subject of active research has been on the involvement of the intracellular and/or the extracellular portions of the receptor in the dimerization process. One group demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation, using full-length and truncated hNPR-A, that the extracellular domain is directly implicated in receptor dimerization process (15Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies using gel filtration instead of co-immunoprecipitation concluded that the intracellular portion is also involved in receptor dimerization (18Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that this interaction is mediated by a hinge region located between the KHD and GC regions (18Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,19Thompson D.K. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 425-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Within the natriuretic peptide receptor family, NPR-C represents an exception in different ways as follows: it has a singular structure; it lacks catalytic activity and ligand specificity; and it acts as a clearance receptor (1Chinkers M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 553-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 4Itakura M. Iwashina M. Mizuno T. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8314-8318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cohen D. Koh G.Y. Nikonova L.N. Porter J.G. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9863-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of NPR-C resides in its disulfide-linked homodimeric structure. The five NPR-C cysteines, all lying in the extracellular domain, have been well studied (4Itakura M. Iwashina M. Mizuno T. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8314-8318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Iwashina M. Mizuno T. Hirose S. Ito T. Hagiwara H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutational studies of these cysteines indicated that the first four cysteines are joined sequentially, forming the Cys104-Cys132 and the Cys209-Cys257 loops and that the fifth cysteine Cys469 (juxtamembranous) is part of an inter-chain disulfide bridge (4Itakura M. Iwashina M. Mizuno T. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8314-8318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a splicing NPR-C isoform (NPR-C6), which exists in minor abundancy, displays an accessory and adjacent juxtamembranous cysteine also contributing to interchain disulfide bridge (21Mizuno T. Iwashina M. Itakura M. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5162-5167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, considerable sequence homologies are present in the extracellular domain between the NPRs, and the conservation of spacing between the cysteine residues is remarkable. Following these observations, we studied alignment of the juxtamembranous regions of the NPRs with all the known particulate guanylyl cyclases (Fig.1). This comparison shows two invariant cysteines spaced by 6–8 residues, except for the following: 1) the guanylin receptor (GC-C) where no cysteine is found; and 2) the NPR-C receptor where the first juxtamembranous cysteine is absent. From these observations, it is easily conceivable that these two conserved juxtamembranous cysteines are forming an intrachain bridge precluding inter-chain disulfide linkage of receptor dimers. In the case of NPR-C, the absence of the first juxtamembranous cysteine (equivalent to Cys423 in NPR-A) would leave a free and reactive cysteine and would permit inter-chain linkage of the second (Cys469of NPR-C, equivalent to Cys432 in NPR-A). In this study, we tested this hypothesis by mutating the first juxtamembranous cysteine (Cys423) of rat (r)NPR-A leaving the second (Cys432) unpaired and reactive in expectation of formation of interchain bridge alike in NPR-C. Interestingly, it turned out to be the case, and furthermore, this covalent dimer mimics the agonist-induced activation process by constitutively activating the receptor. rNPR-A mutants were engineered in the expression vector pBK-Neo (Stratagene). The rNPR-A HT-ECD mutant was constructed by inserting a SalI site at codon positions 437–439 using the mutagenesis kit fromCLONTECH with the mutagenic primer 5′-CCAAGACCACTTGTCGACACTGGAGGTT-3′. Transmembrane and intracellular corresponding regions of this mutant were eliminated by aSalI/Asp718 codigestion. A synthetic linker (complementary oligonucleotides 5′-TCGACACTGAGATCTCATCACCATCACCATCACTAG-3′ and 5′-GTACCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAGATCTCAGTG-3′) was ligated to complete the construction. This linker, including SalI andAsp718 cohesive ends, was composed of a BglII site followed by a hexa-histidine coding sequence and a stop codon. TheSalI mutation resulted in a codon change of Phe437 to Leu, thus the Phe437 codon was restored by mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide 5′-CCAAGACCACTTTTCGACACTGAG-3′. The final construct included all the extracellular sequence up to Leu440 followed by Arg-Ser (His)6. HT-ECDC423S and rNPR-AC423Swere obtained by mutating the Cys423 codon in Ser using the mutagenic primer 5′-CGTCCCTAAATCTGGCTTTGACAATG-3′. The construction and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing on the two strands using the Sequenase kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The human embryonal kidney cell line 293 (American Type Culture Collection) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For the cyclic GMP stimulation experiments, cells of the NPR-A, NPR-AC423S, and Neo clones were seeded at 105 cells/well onto 24-well cluster plates. Experiments were performed when the cells reached confluence. Transient expression of the HT-ECD, HT-ECDC423S, rNPR-A and rNPR-AC423S was obtained by transfection using the CaHPO4 precipitation as described elsewhere (22Lia F. Rajotte D. Clark S.C. Hoang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28287-28293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For stable expression of the rNPR-A, rNPR-AC423S, and HT-ECD, clones were selected in 600 μg/ml G-418 (Geneticin, Boehringer Mannheim) in culture medium. For the control, clones were selected after transfection with pBK-Neo. Membranes for the binding studies were prepared as follow. 72 h post-transfection, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mmEDTA containing 10−6m aprotinin, 10−6m pepstatin, 10−6m leupeptin, 10−5m pefabloc). Cells were first homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer followed by further homogenization in a Teflon glass potter. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 35,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended and washed twice in the same buffer. Finally, membranes were resuspended in ice-cold freezing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and the proteases inhibitors), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. For the particulate guanylyl cyclase studies, membranes were prepared from the stable clones (rNPR-A, rNPR-AC423S, and Neo) according to a similar procedure. In that case, homogenization and freezing were performed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPO4, 0.1m NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4 and the proteases inhibitors. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). HT-ECD was purified from cell culture medium of a stably expressing clone. For HT-ECDC423S, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected, and culture supernatant was collected 72 h post-transfection. Supernatants were dialyzed twice against 60 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 m NaCl. After adding 16% glycerol the dialysate was aliquoted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For purification, an aliquot (typically 20 ml) was slowly thawed at 4 °C. The sample, to which was added a final concentration of 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, was gently mixed batchwise overnight with 0.2 ml of Ni-NTA agarose gel (Qiagen). After the incubation, the gel suspension was packed on a column and washed with 10 volumes of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. Elution of HT-ECD or HT-ECDC423S was done with 10 volumes of the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. 125I-rANP was prepared using the lactoperoxidase method. Briefly, rat ANP (3 nmol) was mixed with 100 ng of lactoperoxidase and 1 mCi of Na125I in a volume of 40 μl of 0.1 n sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6. The reaction was started by adding 5 μl (3 nmol) of H2O2. The incubation was carried out for 5 min at 22 °C. The addition of H2O2 was repeated twice with a 5-min incubation each time. The mono-iodinated product was purified by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography as described elsewhere (23Fethiere J. Meloche S. Nguyen T.T. Ong H. De Lean A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 584-592PubMed Google Scholar). Binding to membranes was performed at 4 °C for 22 h in 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MnCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Competition experiments were done by incubation of 3–5 μg of HEK 293 membrane with 10 fmol of125I-rANP and increasing concentration of non-radioactive peptides. Bound 125I-rANP was separated from free ligand by filtration on GF/C filters precoated with 1% polyethyleneimine. The binding to purified HT-ECD and HT-ECDC423S was performed at 4 °C for 22 h in 0.1 ml of binding buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% lysozyme). For competition studies, 10 fmol (for HT-ECDC423S) or 100 fmol (for HT-ECD) of125I-rANP and increasing amounts of competing peptide were added to the reaction mixture. Bound 125I-rANP was separated from free by adding of 0.1 ml of ice-cold dextran-coated charcoal equilibrated in the same buffer. After vigorous vortexing and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min, 0.1 ml of the supernatant was measured in a gamma counter. Confluent cells (NPR-A, NPR-AC423S, and Neo clones) on 24-well cluster plates were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and were incubated in a final volume of 1 ml of the same medium containing 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and varying concentrations (10−12 to 10−7m) of rANP. After 1 h incubation, the extracellular cyclic GMP was determined by radioimmunoassay as already described (23Fethiere J. Meloche S. Nguyen T.T. Ong H. De Lean A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 584-592PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes obtained from NPR-A, NPR-AC423S, and Neo clones were used for guanylyl cyclase assays as described in other studies (9Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The membranes (5 μg) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, with 10 mm theophylline, 2 mm IBMX, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units of creatine kinase, 1 mm GTP, and 4 mm MgCl2. Different conditions were tested by including 1 μm rANP, 1 mm ATP, rANP with ATP, or 1% Triton X-100 with 4 mm MnCl2 instead of MgCl2. Cyclic GMP was separated from GTP by chromatography on alumina and evaluated by radioimmunoassay as previously reported (23Fethiere J. Meloche S. Nguyen T.T. Ong H. De Lean A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 584-592PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins (50–100 μg) were separated on 5% SDS-PAGE in the presence or in absence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol in the loading buffer. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Novablot semi-dry transfer system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection of NPR-A was achieved using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the sequence YGERGSSTRG corresponding to human NPR-A carboxyl terminus and purified by affinity chromatography. The rat NPR-A differs from this epitope at a single position; however, both receptors have been shown to be equally recognized. Specific signal was probed with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody according to the ECL Western blotting Analysis System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). His-tagged HT-ECD and HT-ECDC423S were run on 7.5% SDS-PAGE in the presence or in absence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol in the loading buffer. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described above. These ectodomains were detected using a commercial mouse anti-tetra-histidine antibody (Qiagen) according to the technique provided by the manufacturer. Specific signal was probed with an horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse polyclonal antibody using the ECL Western blotting Analysis System. Dose-response curves were analyzed with the program AllFit for Windows based on the four-parameter logistic equation (25De Léan A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radioligand binding data were analyzed with the same program based on a model for the law of mass action (26De Léan A. Hancock A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that mutation of Cys423 to Ser would allow intermolecular linkage between two receptor subunits. Membrane preparations from HEK 293 cells expressing wild type rat NPR-A and NPR-AC423S were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 2 the migration of the C423S mutant under non-reducing conditions indicates that its state of oligomerization is mainly higher than monomeric. The estimated molecular mass is about 260 kDa, compatible with NPR-A dimer. A residual monomeric band is visible and accounts for approximately 15% of the total signal as estimated by densitometry. However, in other experiments this signal was barely detectable indicating that the proportion of residual monomers may vary (not shown). In repeat experiments, no higher molecular weight oligomer above the dimer could be seen neither for the wild type nor in the mutant NPR-A. Thus, our results demonstrate that disulfide-linkage of rNPR-A can be specifically induced by the C423S mutation and that the wild type receptor does not spontaneously form intermolecular covalent linkage. Inherent to these results is the capacity of rNPR-A to dimerize non-covalently in absence of ligand. We also assessed the capacity of the C423S mutation to produce disulfide linkage of a soluble NPR-A extracellular domain. His-tagged wild type (HT-ECD) and C423S mutated (HT-ECDC423S) receptors were produced, purified on Ni-NTA agarose gel, and analyzed for their level of dimerization. As seen in Fig. 3, wild type HT-ECD shows a single band on non-reducing SDS-PAGE corresponding to ECD monomers of ∼67 kDa. Interestingly, HT-ECDC423Smigrates as two bands corresponding to monomers (∼67 kDa) and dimers (∼127 kDa). This ∼127-kDa band mainly accounts for ∼60% of the total signal as evaluated by densitometry. It can be concluded from these results that the ECDC423S can spontaneously form disulfide-linkage in the absence of ligand but with significantly less efficiency than the full-length rNPR-AC423S. In order to investigate the effect of covalent dimerization of rNPR-AC423S on natriuretic peptide affinity, we characterized binding of rANP and pBNP through competition curves against 125I-rANP. These two peptides were chosen because our recent work demonstrated that rANP displays only high affinity binding on membranes prepared from COS-P-expressing rNPR-A, whereas pBNP shows two classes of binding components corresponding to high and low affinities (27Marquis M. Fenrick R. Pedro L. Bouvier M. De Léan A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, using receptor expressed in HEK 293, competition studies on membranes using rANP are still showing a unique high affinity binding component with rNPR-A (pK 10.7 ± 0.06) as well as with rNPR-AC423S (pK 10.37 ± 0.17) (TableI). pBNP competition curve on wild type rNPR-A yields two components corresponding to high (pK9.56 ± 0.06) and low (pK 7.91 ± 0.05) affinities, which is similar to the values obtained in our previous work for intact rNPR-A (27Marquis M. Fenrick R. Pedro L. Bouvier M. De Léan A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, competition binding of pBNP on rNPR-AC423S yields a curve that is globally shifted to the left (Fig. 4). Analysis of this curve still discriminates two binding components with pK values of 10.11 ± 0.16 and 8.2 ± 0.19. In fact, analysis of the curve indicates that the curve shift mainly is due to a difference in the proportion of high affinity sites that are twice more abundant in rNPR-AC423S (67.4 ± 5.9%) than in wild type rNPR-A (35.5 ± 4.5%) (Table I).Table IAffinities of rANP and pBNP for the wild type rat NPR-A and for the C423S mutantPeptidesWild type rNPR-ArNPR-AC423SpKHigh affinity componentpKHigh affinity component%%rANP2810.71 ± 0.0610010.37 ± 0.17100pBNP329.56 ± 0.0635.5 ± 4.510.11 ± 0.1667.4 ± 5.97.91 ± 0.058.20 ± 0.19HEK 293 cell transfection, membrane preparation, and competitive ligand binding were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results, expressed as pK (−logK d), were obtained by competitive binding of nonradioactive peptides against 125I-rANP binding on membranes from cells expressing the wild type or the mutant receptor.

The competition curves from which these values were derived are shown in Fig. 4. Values are the mean ± S.E., of three experiments. From these results, we conclude that the increase in high affinity component observed with pBNP reflects a conformational state of the receptor that is, at least partially, stabilized by the disulfide linkage. A possible explanation for the low affinity component still observed with rNPR-AC423S may reside in the residual non-linked receptor seen on non-reducing SDS-PAGE."
https://openalex.org/W2146847333,"Transport of antigens through the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) of Peyer's patch (PP) is the critical first step in the induction of mucosal immune responses. We have previously described that short-term exposure to Streptococcus pneumoniae R36a induced dramatic morphological alterations of the FAE in rabbit PP. These results prompted us to investigate whether the pneumococci-induced modifications were accompanied by enhanced ability of the FAE to transport antigens. We addressed this problem by evaluating the ability of the FAE to bind, internalize, and transport fluorescent polystyrene microparticles, highly specific to rabbit M cells, after exposure to S. pneumoniae. Quantitative study revealed a marked increase in the number of microspheres in PP tissues exposed to S. pneumoniae compared to tissues exposed to either phosphate-buffered saline or Escherichia coli DH5alpha as controls. No sign of bacterially induced damage to the epithelial barrier was observed. Further confocal microscopy analysis of the FAE surface showed that a significant increase in the number of cells that showed both morphological and functional features of M cells took place within pneumococci-treated PP tissues. These data provide the first direct evidence that the FAE-specific antigen sampling function may be manipulated to improve antigen and drug delivery to the intestinal immune system."

Therefore, nuclear import and export receptors and their protein recognition sites are predicted to be distinct. Nevertheless, the ∼38-amino acid M9 sequence present in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 has been reported to serve as both a nuclear localization signal and a nuclear export signal, even though only one protein, the nuclear import factor transportin, has been shown to bind M9 directly. We have used a combination of mutational randomization followed by selection for transportin binding to exhaustively define amino acids in M9 that are critical for transportin binding in vivo. As expected, the resultant ∼12-amino acid transportin-binding consensus sequence is also predictive of nuclear localization signal activity. Surprisingly, however, this extensive mutational analysis failed to dissect M9 nuclear localization signal and nuclear export signal function. Nevertheless, transportin appears unlikely to be the M9 export receptor, as RanGTP can be shown to block M9 binding by transportin not only in vitro, but also in the nucleus in vivo.

Sci. 1998; 23: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Directionality of movement appears, at least in part, to be controlled by the low cytoplasmic and high nuclear concentration of the GTP-bound form of Ran (4Koepp D.M. Silver P.A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, import factors, such as Imp-β, are believed to bind to nuclear localization signals (NLSs) or adaptor molecules, such as importin/karyopherin α, in the cytoplasm, where RanGTP is found at very low concentrations. Once the resultant import receptor-substrate complex reaches the nucleus, where RanGTP exists at high concentrations, the direct interaction of Imp-β with RanGTP induces the release of the protein cargo (5Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 6Rexach M. Blobel G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Conversely, Imp-β-related nuclear export factors such as Cas and Crm1 are believed to bind proteins containing a cognate nuclear export signal (NES) in the nucleus only in the form of a ternary complex involving RanGTP (8Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 9Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Once the resultant export receptor-substrate complex reaches the cytoplasm, RanGTP is hydrolyzed to RanGDP by the cytoplasmic RanGAP and RanBP1 or RanBP2 proteins, thereby inducing the release of the export receptor from both Ran and the export substrate. A prediction of the hypothesis that RanGTP is critical for both NES substrate binding and NLS substrate release in the cell nucleus is that Imp-β-like transport factors should be dedicated to either import or export, depending on whether RanGTP induces substrate release or binding (1Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA. 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 3Weis K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A corollary of this prediction is that protein NES and NLS sequences should be recognized by different transport factors and should therefore be distinct. In general, this is indeed the case. Thus, leucine-rich NES sequences of the type first identified in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev function only in nuclear export, whereas basic NLS sequences of the type found in SV40 T-antigen and nucleoplasmin function only to mediate nuclear import (1Izaurralde E.

Sci. 1998; 23: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Yet, one clear exception to this prediction exists, i.e. a sequence termed M9 that is present in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) and related mRNA-binding proteins and that has been reported to function as both an NLS and an NES (10Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 11Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J.

One group has defined the M9 NLS/NES as a 38-amino acid sequence located between residues 268 and 305 of hnRNP A1 (10Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), whereas a second group, which primarily analyzed nuclear import, has localized the hnRNP A1 NLS to a largely overlapping sequence extending from residues 260 to 289 (12Weighardt F. Biamonti G. Riva S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the core of the M9 NLS is likely to be located between hnRNP A1 residues 268 and 289. Little additional information on the identity of the M9 NLS/NES has been published, although it is known that mutation of either glycine 274 or proline 275 to alanine blocks both NLS and NES function (10Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Attempts to identify a protein that might mediate M9 function resulted in the cloning of an Imp-β-related transport factor termed transportin (Trn) or karyopherin b2 (13Pollard V.W. Michael W.M.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trn not only binds the M9 NLS/NES specifically both in vitro and in vivo, but also can mediate the specific import of substrate proteins bearing the M9 NLS into isolated nuclei in vitro. Because of the expectation that the M9 NLS and NES functions should reflect the interaction of M9 with distinct nuclear import and export receptors (1Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA. 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 3Weis K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and given that the M9 sequence remains both large and ill defined, we have attempted to dissect the M9 NLS/NES by using a previously reported strategy (16Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2888-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) of sequence randomization followed byin vivo selection for M9 sequences that retain their ability to bind Trn. Using this approach, we have defined the sequence requirements for M9 NLS function in detail and report that these are indistinguishable from those required for M9 NES function. Possible interpretations of this surprising result are discussed. Alanine-scanning mutants of the M9 NLS/NES were constructed in the previously described pGBT9/M9 yeast expression plasmid, which expresses the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to hnRNP A1 residues 256–320 (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were generated using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using complementary oligonucleotide primers that introduced the sequence 5′-GCGGCCGCTGCA-3′ in place of wild-type M9 sequences. This mutation substitutes four alanines for each set of four targeted M9 residues, as shown in Table I, and also introduces a uniqueNotI site (underlined). Carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of M9 sequence 256–320 were generated by annealing an oligonucleotide to the relevant inserted NotI restriction enzyme site that introduced a translation termination codon after the first two alanine codons. Sequences encoding M9 residues 256–263 were deleted by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and substituted by two glycine codons. All scanning mutants were verified by DNA sequence analysis, and their expression levels were quantitated by Western blot analysis as described previously (16Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell.

The two synthetic M9 derivatives 8.4.10 and 11.4.11, which express M9 variants mutated between residues 269 and 280, were each generated by a two-step polymerase chain reaction procedure using two flanking primers and two overlapping core primers. Both mutants were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Prokaryotic expression plasmids (pGST-M9) encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) linked to wild-type or mutant forms of M9 residues 256–320 were generated by insertion of the relevant EcoRI-XhoI DNA fragment encoding M9, as described above, into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The parental two-hybrid vectors pGBT9 (CLONTECH) and pVP16 and their derivatives, pGBT9/M9 and pVP16/Trn-(541–890), have been described (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA forms of human Trn and Trn2 were excised from the previously described pGEM3-Trn and pBS-Trn2 expression plasmids (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) by cleavage with NcoI andXhoI and were then cloned into pVP16 to generate pVP16/Trn-(1–890) and pVP16/Trn2-(1–894), respectively. Similarly, a plasmid encoding a fusion protein consisting of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain linked to full-length human Ran was generated by excision of the Ran cDNA from a previously described pGex4T-1/Ran expression plasmid (19Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) by cleavage with BamHI and XhoI followed by ligation into pGBT9. A plasmid (pGEM3-Trn) that permits efficient expression of full-length human Trn in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system has been described (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also described is a prokaryotic expression plasmid encoding GST linked to wild-type human Ran (19Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This latter plasmid was modified to encode GST linked to the Ran mutant Q69L (20Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), which is GTPase-deficient. All two-hybrid assays were performed as described previously (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Y190 yeast cells (21Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5249) Google Scholar) were transformed with the appropriate Gal4 (pGBT9-TRP+) and VP16 (pVP16-LEU+) fusion protein expression plasmids, and transformants were plated on drop-out plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. Four days later, colonies were pooled into liquid-selective medium and grown an additional 20 h. At this time, β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant GST/M9 proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified by standard protocols in the absence of detergents as described previously (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and then concentrated by centrifugation using Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon, Inc.). Recombinant non-fusion Ran Q69L mutant protein (20Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) was expressed and purified as described previously for wild-type Ran protein (19Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, gentamycin, and Fungizone. Two days prior to injection, 2 × 105 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 35-mm culture plates. To increase the prevalence of binuclear cells, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on the evening prior to microinjection. At ∼16 h later, the cells were refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and cultured for a further 4–6 h prior to use in microinjection assays. Prior to microinjection, each GST/M9 fusion protein was diluted to ∼2 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline and supplemented with 1 mg/ml rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). After microinjection, which took from 8 to 10 min/sample at room temperature, each coverslip was incubated with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for between 1 and 30 min (cytoplasmic injections) or for 20 min (nuclear injections) prior to fixation using 3% paraformaldehyde. The subcellular localization of each injected protein was then determined by double-label immunofluorescence as described previously (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST/M9·35S-Trn complexes were formed in the presence of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm magnesium acetate) for 30 min at 25 °C and then collected by addition of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Beads containing M9·Trn complexes were washed once with binding buffer and then incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in Ran buffer alone (phosphate-buffered saline and 1 mm magnesium acetate) or with 10 μg of Ran Q69L in the presence of 5 mm GTP or GDP. After washing with Ran buffer, proteins still bound to the Sepharose beads were eluted with 1m MgCl2 and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel). In vitro translated (TNT, Promega), 35S-labeled Trn was visualized by fluorography (ENHANCE, NEN Life Science Products). As noted above, Michael et al. (10Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) have localized the M9 NLS/NES by deletion mutagenesis to between residues 268 and 305 of hnRNP A1, whereas Weighardt et al. (12Weighardt F. Biamonti G. Riva S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a comparable approach, localized the hnRNP A1 NLS to between hnRNP A1 residues 260 and 289 (Fig. 1). To more clearly identify which residues within this region might contribute to NLS and/or NES function and to Trn binding, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis by sequential insertion of clusters of four alanines between residues 265 and 292 of the M9 sequence in the context of the previously described yeast two-hybrid plasmid pGBT9/M9 (Fig. 1) (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pGBT9/M9 plasmid encodes the Gal4 DNA-binding domain linked to residues 256–320 of hnRNP A1. These M9 mutants were then analyzed for their ability to interact with the M9-binding domain of human Trn using the yeast two-hybrid assay as described previously (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The G274A mutant of M9, which fails to interact with Trn (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), served as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 1, mutant M9-Δ2, which bears alanines at residues 273–276, was not able to detectably interact with Trn, a result that was expected in light of the inactivity of the G274A missense mutant. In contrast, all other mutants retained at least weak Trn-binding ability. The least active of these latter mutants was M9-Δ1, which retained only ∼2% of the activity of the wild type. However, mutants M9-D0 and M9-D3 were also significantly inhibited in their ability to bind Trn, retaining ∼26 and ∼7% of wild-type activity, respectively. In contrast, mutants M9-D4, M9-D5, and M9-D6 retained wild-type levels of Trn-binding activity. Western blot analysis of these yeast transformants showed that the wild-type and mutant forms of these Gal4/M9 fusion proteins were all expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 2). Overall, these data therefore suggest that the Trn-binding domain of hnRNP A1 is localized to between residues 265 and 280, with the most critical residues located between positions 269 and 276. To more fully confirm this hypothesis, we generated several M9 deletion mutants in the context of the Gal4/M9-(256–320) fusion protein and investigated whether these retained Trn-binding activity in the two-hybrid assay. As shown in Table I, hnRNP A1 residues 256–284 or 256–280 retained high levels of Trn binding, whereas the 256–272 deletion mutant was, as expected, inactive. Although the M9 deletion mutant retaining hnRNP A1 residues 264–284, a total of only 21 amino acids, also retained strong Trn-binding activity, the 264–280 mutant did show a significant drop in Trn binding, retaining only ∼8% of the activity of sequence 256–320 (Table I). All M9 deletion mutants were again expressed at comparable levels in yeast cells, as determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-Gal4 antiserum (Fig. 2). These deletion data therefore confirm the alanine-scanning analysis shown in Fig. 1 and map the core Trn-binding sequence of hnRNP A1 to between residues 264 and 280. As noted above, Trn has been shown to mediate the nuclear import of substrates bearing the M9 NLS/NES, and M9 mutants that fail to bind Trn, such as G274A, also fail to import (13Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the NLS activity of the M9 mutants given in Fig. 1, we purified recombinant proteins consisting of GST linked to wild-type or mutant forms of M9 (hnRNP A1 residues 256–320). These were then mixed with a rabbit IgG tracer protein and microinjected into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, a process that takes 8–10 min at room temperature for each sample. After microinjection, cultures were fed fresh 37 °C culture medium, incubated at 37 °C for 1 or 30 min, and then fixed and stained with anti-GST and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies as described previously (15Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 (C andD), the wild-type M9 sequence proved to be a highly effective NLS sequence in that essentially all of the wild-type GST/M9 protein was localized to the nucleus within 1 min of completion of microinjection. In contrast, the GST/D2 fusion failed to detectably accumulate in the nucleus even by 30 min after microinjection (Fig. 3,M and N), as is indeed expected based on the inability of the M9-D2 mutant to bind Trn (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the M9-D1 and M9-D3 mutants both showed significant nuclear accumulation by 30 min after microinjection (Fig. 3, E, F,I, and J). However, these mutant M9 sequences are clearly a substantially less effective NLS than the wild-type M9 sequence, as judged by the weak nuclear accumulation seen at 1 min after injection (Fig. 3, G, H, K, andL). It is therefore apparent that the markedly reduced affinity for Trn displayed by the M9-D1 and M9-D3 mutants (Fig. 1) is nevertheless sufficient to mediate nuclear import, albeit with reduced efficiency. The other M9 mutants, i.e. M9-D0, M9-D4, M9-D5, and M9-D6 (Fig. 1), were all found to mediate nuclear entry with an efficiency comparable to that seen with the wild-type GST/M9 fusion protein, consistent with their ability to bind Trn effectively in vivo (Fig. 1 and data not shown). We next wished to investigate whether the mutations described in Fig. 1 would affect the NES activity of the M9 sequence. Because M9 is a more effective NLS than NES, protein substrates bearing the M9 sequence appear to localize to the cell nucleus at steady state even though they have been shown to continuously shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (22Piñol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). To measure NES activity, we have therefore developed an assay for protein nucleocytoplasmic shuttling that depends upon the microinjection of recombinant proteins into a single nucleus in a cell containing two or more nuclei. Such cells normally exist at a low level in a culture of HeLa cells, but their prevalence can be increased by overnight culture in serum-free medium followed by 4–6 h of culture in medium containing serum. Such an experiment, in which binuclear cells were injected with wild-type or mutant GST/M9 proteins together with an IgG tracer, is shown in Fig. 4. After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, much of the microinjected wild-type GST/M9 protein migrated from the injected nucleus, identified by the IgG tracer, to the uninjected nucleus (Fig. 4, A andB). Similarly, both the GST/D1 and GST/D3 proteins were also able to migrate to the other nucleus, although this process appeared less efficient and also led to a low but detectable level of cytoplasmic protein accumulation (Fig. 4, E andK). Finally, the GST/D2 mutant, which failed to import into the cell nucleus (Fig. 3), also failed to exit the injected nucleus (Fig. 4 H). All the other M9 mutants described in Fig. 1,i.e. M9-D0, M9-Δ4, M9-Δ5, and M9-Δ6, all demonstrated efficient nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and therefore clearly retain NES activity (data not shown). Although the M9 mutants delineated in Fig. 1 failed to segregate M9 NLS and NES activity, these mutants are clearly too crude to prove this point clearly. As an alternative approach, we therefore decided to totally randomize each of the four amino acid segments defined by mutants M9-D0, M9-Δ1, M9-Δ2, and M9-Δ3 and then select for retention of the ability to bind Trn effectively using the two-hybrid assay in yeast. This approach, which we have previously used to define the sequence requirements for leucine-rich NES function (17Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), should fully define the sequence requirements for Trn binding in vivo and also generate a large pool of variant M9 sequences that should retain NLS activity. However, if M9 NES function is dependent on an interaction with an unknown nuclear export receptor distinct from Trn, then this extensive pool of M9 sequence variants should allow segregation of M9 NLS function from M9 NES activity. The M9 sequence present in pGBT9/M9 was therefore randomized in four 4-amino acid segments, and each library was analyzed for Trn binding in the yeast two-hybrid context by screening for expression of thehis3 selectable marker. M9 variants that permitted yeast colony growth under selective conditions were then recovered and retransformed to confirm that the observed his3 expression was indeed mediated by an interaction with Trn. These secondary transformants were also analyzed for level of expression of a second indicator gene, lacZ, as a measure of the affinity of the interaction of Trn with the various recov"

The nature of the insecticidal activity ofPhotorhabdus bacteria was investigated for its potential application as an insect control agent.

Purified toxin A and toxin B exhibited single bands on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two peptides of 208 and 63 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The native molecular weight of both the toxin A and toxin B was determined to be approximately 860 kDa, suggesting that they are tetrameric. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing and Western analysis using monospecific antibodies to each toxin demonstrated that the two toxins were distinct but homologous. The oral potency (LD50) of toxin A and toxin B against Southern corn rootworm larvae was determined to be similar to that observed with highly potent Bt toxins against lepidopteran pests. In addition, it was found that the two peptides present in toxin B could be processed in vitro from a 281-kDa protoxin by endogenous P. luminescens proteases.

The mechanism by which the entomopathogenic nematodes are able to predate and reproduce in the host involves a mutualistic relationship between the nematode and its symbiotic bacteria, Photorhabdus sp. andXenorhabdus sp. (6Akhurst R.J. Dunphy G.B. Beckage N. Thompson S. Federici B. Entomopathogenic Nematodes in Biological Control. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 75-87Google Scholar, 7Forst S. Nealson K.

Khobenhavn. 1937; 101: 1-114Google Scholar) had postulated an association between a steinernematid species and a bacterium during the 1930's. However, it was not until 1966 that Poinar (9Poinar Jr., G.O. Nematologica. 1966; 12: 105-108Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that a single species of bacterium in the family Enterobacteriaceae was present in the anterior region of the infective nematode of this species. Since then investigators have shown thatSteinernema species carry bacteria of the genusXenorhabdus while Heterorhabditis nematodes harbor species of the genus Photorhabdus (10Thomas G.M. Poiner Jr., G.O. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1979; 29: 352-360Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 11Akhurst R.J. Boemare N.E. J. Gen. Micro. 1988; 134: 1835-1845PubMed Google Scholar). In 1993, Photorhabdus bacteria were proposed by Boemare and colleagues (12Boemare N. Akhurst R.J. Mourant R.G. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 249-255Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar) for re-classification as a distinct genus fromXenorhabdus, based on a variety of phenotyptic, ecological, and molecular studies. Recently, increased support for the separation of these two genera was obtained employing 16 S ribosomal DNA analysis (13Szallas E. Koch C. Fodor A. Burghardt J. Buss O. Szentirmai A. Nealson K. Stackedbrandt E. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Photorhabdus is represented by a single species,Photorhabdus luminescens, so named because of its bioluminescent nature. This phenotype is unique among the Enterobacteriaceae and other bacteria of terrestrial origin. Once an infective juvenile nematode has penetrated the host hemocoel, the bacterial symbiont is released from the nematode gut, septicemia becomes established, and insect death occurs within 48 h. Although the nematodes may play a role in insect death, in most cases the bacteria alone are sufficient to cause insect mortality following injection into the hemocoel (14Gotz P. Boman A. Boman H.G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1981; 212: 333-350Google Scholar, 15Balcerzak M. Acta Parasitol. Pol. 1991; 36: 175-181Google Scholar). The importance of these bacteria in the life cycle of the nematode has been well documented using axenically reared nematodes (14Gotz P. Boman A. Boman H.G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1981; 212: 333-350Google Scholar, 16Gerritsen L.J.M. Smits P.H. Fundam. Appl. Nematol. 1993; 16: 367-373Google Scholar). Together with the lack of evidence for the free living existence of this bacterium, it has been postulated that the symbiotic association is essential for the survival of both nematode and its symbiotic bacteria. However, one possible exception is the report by Farmer et al. (17Farmer III, J.J. Jorgensen J.H. Grimont P.A. Akhurst R.J. Poinar Jr., G.O. Ageron E. Pierce G.V. Smith J.A. Carter G.P. Wilson K.L.

Biocon. Sci. Technol. 1996; 6: 333-345Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The precise set of mechanisms by which the symbiotic bacterium is able to circumvent the defense host systems in the hemocoel is still under investigation. It has been suggested that the virulence events that lead to bacterial proliferation could involve multiple factors, such as secretion of lipases and proteases, the release of lipopolysaccharide molecules, and the anti-hemocytic properties of the bacterial cell surface (19Akhurst R.J.

Recently, Clarke and Dowds (29Clarke D.J. Dowds B.C.A. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1995; 66: 149-155Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) speculated that a secreted lipase is responsible for the insecticidal activity observed against Galleria mellonella. In addition to secreted factors, these bacteria are known to produce intracellular inclusion bodies similar to those produced by Bacillus thuringiensis (30Couche G. Gregson R. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5279-5288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bowen D. Ensign J. Proc. Mtg. Am. Soc. Microbiol. 1987; 183: I-66Google Scholar). But unlike Bt endotoxin crystals they are not insecticidal and are thought to provide amino acid nutrients for the emerging nematodes (32Bintrim S.B. Ensign J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other studies, Bowen (33.Bowen, D., Characterization of a High Molecular Weight Insecticidal Protein Complex Produced by the Entomopathogenic Bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, University of Wisconsin, Madison.Google Scholar) reported that a soluble protein fraction derived from P. luminescensculture medium possessed sufficient insecticidal activity to killManduca sexta upon injection. As part of our efforts to find suitable insecticidal proteins that could be employed to produce insect-resistant plants, we initiated a study to further characterize the nature of the oral insecticidal activity. It was found that ofP. luminescens W-14 fermentation broth showed excellent potency against Southern corn rootworm (SCR)1 neonates, a surrogate maize pest. We describe here the isolation and characterization of two distinct but structurally similar protein toxins that are highly potent against SCR larvae. We also show that toxin could be further processed and activated by protease cleavage. Stock inoculum of P. luminescens strain W-14 (ATCC accession number 55397) was produced by inoculating 175 ml of 2% Proteose Peptone number 3 (PP3) (Difco) liquid media with a primary variant subclone in a 500-ml flask and incubated for 16 h at 28 °C on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. The production broth was achieved by inoculation of 1.75 ml of the stock inoculum into fresh PP3 medium in 500-ml flasks (175 ml of culture/flask). After inoculation, the culture was incubated at 28 °C for 24 h as above. Following incubation, the broth was centrifuged at 2,600 × g for 1 h at 10 °C and vacuum filtered through Whatman GF/D (2.7 μm) and GF/B (1 μm) glass filters to remove debris. The broth was then used for the studies described here. Protein fractions were diluted into 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and applied directly in 40-μl aliquots to diet plate wells (surface area 1.5 cm2) containing artificial diet (34Rose R.I. McCabe J.M. J. Econ. Entomol. 1973; 66: 398-400Crossref Google Scholar). The diet plate was then allowed to air dry in a sterile flow-hood. The wells were then infested with single, neonate Diabrotica undecimpunctate howardi (Southern corn rootworm) hatched from surface sterilized eggs. The plates were sealed, placed in a humidified growth chamber, and maintained at 27 °C for 3–5 days. Mortality was then scored. For quantitation of toxin potency, 16 insects per toxin dose were used, and assays were repeated 2–4 separate times. LC50 was determined using the toxin concentration needed to cause 50% insect mortality. Unless noted, the isolation protocol entailed starting with 5 liters of broth that was concentrated using an Amicon (Beverly, MA) spiral ultrafiltration cartridge Type S1Y100 (molecular mass cut off 100 kDa) attached to an Amicon M-12 filtration device. The retentate was diafiltered with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 (Buffer A), until the absorbance of filtrate at 280 nm was below 0.1. The retentate was then applied at 5 ml/min to a Poros 50 HQ (PerSeptive Biosystem, Framingham, MA) strong anion exchange column (1.6 × 15 cm). The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of Buffer A and then eluted with 0.4m NaCl in Buffer A. The biologically active fraction, determined by SCR bioassays, was loaded in 20-ml aliquots onto a gel filtration column Sepharose CL-4B (2.6 × 100 cm) which was equilibrated with Buffer A. The protein was eluted in Buffer A at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The biologically active fractions were pooled and applied to a Mono-Q 10/10 column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (Buffer B), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with Buffer B until the optical density at 280 nm returned to baseline level. The proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 1m NaCl in Buffer B at 2 ml/min for 60 min. Two-ml fractions were collected and activity was determined by a dilution series of each fraction in the bioassay. Two activity peaks against SCR were observed and were named A (fraction 14 to 19) and B (fraction 20 to 25). Activity peaks A and B were pooled separately and both peaks were further purified using the procedure described below. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the above protein fractions containing either toxin A or B to a final concentration of 1.7 m. Proteins were then applied to a phenyl-Superose 10/10 column equilibrated with 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4 in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 (Buffer C), at 1 ml/min. After washing the column with 10 ml of Buffer C, proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient of 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4, 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, to 25% ethylene glycol, 25 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 1 ml/min for 120 min. Fractions were dialyzed overnight against Buffer A. The most active factions were pooled and applied to a Mono Q 5/5 column which was equilibrated with Buffer B at 1 ml/min. The proteins bound to the column were eluted at 1 ml/min by a linear gradient of 0 to 1m NaCl in Buffer B. For the final step of purification, the most biologically active fractions were pooled, brought to a final concentration of 1.7m with solid (NH4)2SO4, and applied to a phenyl-Superose 5/5 column equilibrated with Buffer C at 1 ml/min. Proteins bound to the column were then eluted with a linear gradient of Buffer C to 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 0.5 ml/min for 60 min. Fractions were dialyzed overnight against Buffer A. The final purified protein from activity peak A and activity peak B from the Mono Q 10/10 column was named toxin A and toxin B, respectively. The purified toxins were found stable at 4 °C for over 6 months and were used for all the characterizations reported in this paper. The native molecular mass was estimated by gel filtration on either a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column or a Sepharose CL-4B column (1.6 × 50 cm) as specified in each experiment. The columns were calibrated with a mixture of known molecular mass standards. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Native and SDS-PAGE analyses were performed on either 10% or 4–20% gradient gels (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using ECL Western blotting detection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham). The purified toxin A and toxin B, as well as partially purified active gel filtration fractions, were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted to a Bio-Rad polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to the manufacturer's procedure. The protein bands were localized by staining with Amido Black for 1 min (0.1% Amido Black 10 B (Sigma) in 10% acetic acid) followed by destaining for 1 min with 5% acetic acid. Blots were sent for NH2-terminal sequencing at Cambridge ProChem (Lexington, MA). NH2-terminal sequences are described under “Results.” Protein molecular mass using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy was determined on a Voyager Biospectrometry workstation with delayed extraction technology (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Typically, the protein of interest (100–500 pmol in 5 μl) was mixed with 1 μl of acetonitrile and dialyzed for 0.5 to 1 h on a Millipore VS filter having a pore size of 0.025 μm (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Dialysis was performed by floating the filter on water followed by adding the protein/acetonitrile mixture as a droplet to the filter surface. After dialysis, the dialyzed protein was removed using a pipette and then mixed with a matrix consisting of sinapinic acid and trifluoroacetic acid according to the manufacturers' instructions. The protein and matrix (4 μl total volume) were allowed to co-crystallize on a ∼3 cm (2Qin X.X. Kao R.T. Yang H.W. Zhang G.Y. For. Res. 1988; 1: 179-185Google Scholar) gold-plated sample plate (PerSeptive Biosystems). Excitation of the crystals and subsequent mass analysis was performed using the following conditions: laser setting of 3050, pressure of 4.55e-07, low mass gate of 1500.0, negative ions off; accelerating voltage of 25,000, grid voltage of 90.0%, guide wire voltage of 0.010%, linear mode, and a pulse delay time of 350 ns. The genes for toxin A and toxin B described in this paper were subsequently cloned (gene cloning to be presented elsewhere). Unique gene sequences were selected for peptides A1, A2, and B2 (peptides to be described under “Results”). The following peptides were synthesized according to the deduced amino acids sequences: NPNNSSNKLMFYPVYQYSGNT (for peptide A1), VSQGSGSAGSGNNNLAFGAG (for peptide A2), and FDSYSQLYEENINAGEQRA (peptide B2). The corresponding antibodies to the above three peptides were generated in Genemed Biotechnology Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The crude sera were purified using a SulfoLinkTM Coupling Gel column (Pierce). Each column was prepared by immobilizing a specific peptide to the gel following the protocol described by the manufacturer. The respective antisera was applied to the column at the rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6. The purified antibodies were eluted from the column using 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 3.0, and they were immediately neutralized to pH 7.0 with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. The three purified peptide-specific antibodies were named synA1Ab, synA2Ab, and synB2Ab, and specifically recognized peptide A1, A2, and B2, respectively. The standard reaction consisted of 40 μg of purified P. luminescens W-14 toxin B protease as specified under “Results,” and 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0, in a total volume of 100 μl. For control reactions, protease was omitted. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C overnight. At the end of the reaction, 10 μl was removed and then boiled with an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. The remaining 90 μl of reaction mixture was serially diluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and analyzed by SCR bioassay. The fermentation broth of P. luminescensW-14 strain presented a broad spectrum of oral activity against a variety of insects (data not shown), including SCR. Because of our interest in controlling corn rootworm in maize, SCR bioassays were used to follow the Photorhabdus insecticidal activity in this study. Consistent with prior studies by Ensign (33.Bowen, D., Characterization of a High Molecular Weight Insecticidal Protein Complex Produced by the Entomopathogenic Bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, University of Wisconsin, Madison.Google Scholar), it was found that the majority of the activity was retained upon extensive dialysis or upon concentration with devices containing 100-kDa molecular mass filters, indicating that the majority of activity was associated with large molecular mass material. Because of the large size, an Amicon M-12 filtration unit equipped with a 100-kDa membrane was used to enrich activity from 5 to 10 liters of broth. Following a single step elution from an ion-exchange column, the bulk of the activity was further resolved by gel filtration using a preparative Sepharose CL-4B column (Fig. 1 A). The native molecular mass of the activity appeared to be in the range of 700 to 900 kDa, as judged by comparison to the migration of molecular weight standards. SDS-PAGE analysis of this active protein fraction indicated the presence of more than 10 major peptides (Fig. 1 B). It was found that essentially all of the insecticidal activity could be eliminated at temperatures above 60 °C or upon treatment with protease K. Similar results were obtained with broth samples (data not shown). These results are consistent with the toxic activity being proteinaceous. In order to further determine the biochemical nature of the protein toxin, samples were treated with a variety of reversible and irreversible protease inhibitors which included E-64 (cysteine inhibitor), 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (serine inhibitor), leupeptin (serine inhibitor), and pepstatin (aspartic inhibitor). In all cases, no effects were observed on the biological activity of the toxin. In addition, aliquots of toxin complex treated with inhibitors of metalloenzymes, including 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA, did not affect the insecticidal potency. As shown in Table I, NH2-terminal amino acid analysis of selected peptides from the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B) demonstrated that each was distinct, but several peptides appeared to have substantial sequence similarity (50–67%). The amino acid sequence for a 64-kDa peptide corresponded to groEL, an Escherichia coli chaperonin (37Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), whose concentration varied for each preparation. The occurrence of related peptides suggested that several toxins may be present in the 860-kDa fraction.Table INH2-terminal amino acid sequences of peptides in 860-kDa toxin fractionPeptide molecular massAmino acid sequenceaThe symbols used are: *, N/D/P/R/E amino acid; -, no determination; |, identical amino acids; ∶, similar amino acids.201 kDaFIQGYSDLFGN-A∶ | | |∶ |190 kDaLIGYNNQFSG*A175 kDaMQNSQTFSVGEL||∶| |∶∶ |165 kDaMQDSPEVSITTL175 kDaMLSTMEKQLNESQRDA108 kDaMNLASPLISRTE80 kDaMINLDINEQNKIMVV68 kDaSESLFTQTLKEA-RDALVA64 kDaAAKDVKFGSDARVKMLRGVN|||||||| |||||||||||groELAAKDVKFGNDARVKMLRGVN61 kDaAGDTANIGD–FLPa The symbols used are: *, N/D/P/R/E amino acid; -, no determination; |, identical amino acids; ∶, similar amino acids. Open table in a new tab The 860-kDa fraction was applied to a Mono Q column and resolved by a linear salt gradient. It was found that the insect activity was broadly eluted throughout the gradient. Each fraction was bioassayed by serial dilution in order to identify those with the highest SCR activity. Two peaks were identified with high SCR toxicity: one that eluted at approximately 0.2 mNaCl (peak A) and the other at approximately 0.3 m NaCl (peak B) (Fig. 2). Each activity peak was pooled separately and further purified by a series of hydrophobic and ion-exchange chromatography columns. The toxin purified from peak A was denoted toxin A while the toxin from peak B was named toxin B. Both purified toxin A and toxin B contained two predominant bands on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A). The peptides were named A1 and A2 for the large peptides, and A2 and B2 for the small peptides in toxin A and toxin B, respectively.Figure 3Characterization of isolated toxins. A, 4–20% SDS-PAGE of purified toxin A (lane 1) and toxin B (lane 2). 5 and 2 μg of protein were applied to lanes 1 and 2, respectively.

C, estimation of the native molecular mass of toxin A and toxin B by gel filtration on Superdex 200 10/30 column. The protein markers used were: thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; bovine γ-globulin, 158 kDa; chicken ovalbumin, 44 kDa; equine myoglobin, 17 kDa; vitamin B-12, 1.3 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The subunit molecular weights of both toxins were assessed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE as presented in TableII. When the SDS-PAGE gel was quantified by densitometry, the relative band intensity of the large and small peptides in both toxin preparations was found to be approximately 3 to 1 ratio, respectively. Given their molecular masses, these results suggested that these subunits were represented in the purified toxins in equal molar amounts. Toxin A and toxin B showed single stained bands in native PAGE, with toxin A migrating further than toxin B (Fig.3 B). Using gel filtration on Superdex S-200, the native molecular mass of toxin A or toxin B was measured to be approximately 860 kDa (Fig. 3 C). This was re-confirmed by gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-4B column (data not shown). Treatment of the 860-kDa fraction with high salt or non-ionic detergents failed to affect the mobility of the toxin activity on gel filtration. The insecticidal activity (LD50) of toxin A and toxin B against SCR was determined to be 5 and 87 ng/cm2 diet, respectively (Fig.4). Toxin A was also highly potent against tobacco hornworm (M. sexta), a lepidopteran species, however, for toxin B only growth inhibition was detectable against tobacco hornworm.Table IIAnalysis of toxin A and toxin B peptides by MALDI-TOF MS and SDS-PAGEPeptideSDS-PAGEMALDI-TOF MSA1188,000 Da208,186 DaA256,000 Da63,544 DaB1201,000 Da206,473 DaB258,000 Da63,520 Da Open table in a new tab Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed on toxin A and toxin B subunits. The NH2-terminal sequence of B1 was identical to the sequence for the 201-kDa peptide presented in Table I, however, no amino-terminal sequence was obtained for the large subunit of toxin A. High amino acid identity (∼82%) was found between the NH2 terminus of peptides A2 and B2, the smaller peptides of the two toxins (TableIII).Table IIIComparison of NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of small subunits of toxin A and toxin BPeptide A2LRSANTLTDLFLPQ||∶|| |||||Peptide B2ANSLTALFLPQNSRKThe symbols used are: |, identical amino acids; ∶, similar amino acids. Open table in a new tab The symbols used are: |, identical amino acids; ∶, similar amino acids. Since toxin B was an order of magnitude less active than toxin A against SCR neonates, the possibility that the activity observed in toxin B was due to a small amount of contamination of toxin A in the final purified toxin B material was examined by Western analysis using antibodies specific to synthetic peptides corresponding to either toxin A or toxin B. Three peptide-specific antibodies used for analysis were synA1Ab and synA2Ab, which specifically recognized peptides A1 and A2 in toxin A, respectively, and synB2Ab, which specifically recognized peptide B2 in toxin B. Western analysis of purified toxin A and toxin B (5 μg of protein/lane) was performed using the above three antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, immunological analysis showed that only toxin A but not toxin B reacted when either synA1Ab or synA2Ab was used (Fig. 5, A and B). Conversely, only toxin B but not toxin A reacted when synB2Ab was used (Fig. 5 C). This indicated that no detectable cross-contamination existed in the purified toxin A and toxin B fractions. Therefore, the insecticidal activities observed for each toxin were independent of each other. To eliminate the possibility that protease activity was responsible for the insecticidal activity, samples of isolated toxins were examined for enzymatic activity using fluorescein isothiocyanate-derivatized substrates. Compared with controls and endogenous proteases, no significant protease activity was found for either toxin fraction (data not shown). A second biological activity that has been associated with certain classes of bacterial toxins is the ability to lyse different cell types. In order to examine the general lytic properties of these toxins, in vitro assays were performed using rabbit erythrocytes incubated with up to 0.7 and 2 μg of purified toxin A or toxin B, respectively. Using protein sample buffer as controls, no cell lysis was found with either toxin, while erythrocytes treated with the appropriate units of α-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus, a positive control, were comple"

https://openalex.org/W2056319148,"The C3a anaphylatoxin receptor (C3aR) is a G protein-coupled receptor with an unusually large second extracellular loop (e2 loop, approximately 172 amino acids). To determine the function of this unique structure, chimeric and deletion mutants were prepared and analyzed in transfected RBL-2H3 cells. Whereas replacement of the C3aR N-terminal segment with that from the human C5a receptor had minimal effect on C3a binding, substitution of the e2 loop with a smaller e2 loop from the C5a receptor (C5aR) abolished binding of 125I-C3a and C3a-stimulated calcium mobilization. However, as much as 65% of the e2 loop sequence (amino acids 198-308) may be removed without affecting C3a binding or calcium responses. The e2 loop sequences adjacent to the transmembrane domains contain multiple aspartate residues and are found to play an important role in C3a binding based on deletion mutagenesis. Replacement of five aspartate residues in the e2 loop with lysyl residues significantly compromised both the binding and functional capabilities of the C3a receptor mediated by intact C3a or by two C3a analog peptides. These data suggest a two-site C3a-C3aR interaction model similar to that established for C5a/C5aR. The anionic residues near the N and C termini of the C3aR e2 loop constitute a non-effector secondary interaction site with cationic residues in the C-terminal helical region of C3a, whereas the C3a C-terminal sequence LGLAR engages the primary effector site in C3aR."

A cDNA clone (MeCPA) for a novel fungal (Metarhizium anisopliae) carboxypeptidase (MeCPA) was obtained by using reverse transcription differential display polymerase chain reaction to identify pathogenicity genes. MeCPA resembles pancreatic carboxypeptidases in being synthesized as a precursor species (418 amino acids) containing a large amino-terminal fragment (99 amino acids). The mature (secreted) form of MeCPA shows closest amino acid identity to human carboxypeptidases A1 (35%) and A2 (37%). MeCPA was expressed in an insect cell line yielding an enzyme with dual A1 + A2 specificity for branched aliphatic and aromatic COOH-terminal amino acids. However, in contrast to the very broad spectrum A + B-type bacterial enzymes, MeCPA lacks B-type activity against charged amino acids. This is predictable as key catalytic residues determining the specificity of MeCPA are conserved with those of mammalian A-type carboxypeptidases. Thus, in evolutionary terms the fungal enzyme is an intermediate between the divergence of A and B forms and the differentiation of the A form into A1 and A2 isoforms.

N-carbobenzyloxy Autographa californicamultiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus polymerase chain reaction 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid The vertebrate pancreas synthesizes and secretes a subset of zinc carboxypeptidases that hydrolyze alimentary proteins and peptides from their COOH-terminal ends. These are traditionally classified into the A types (with a preference for apolar COOH-terminal residues) and the B types (with a preference for basic COOH-terminal residues) (1Aviles F.X. Vendrell J. Gauash A. Coll M. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 211: 381-389Google Scholar, 2Gardell S.J. Craik C.S. Clauser E. Goldsmith E.J. Stewart C.B. Graf M. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17828-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, actinomycetes (bacteria) produce carboxypeptidases with a dual A + B specificity toward both neutral and basic substrates and the distinct vertebrate A and B types presumably arose from such a precursor (3Breddam K. Carlsburg Res. Commun. 1986; 51: 83-128Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Breddam K. Carlsburg Res. Commun. 1988; 53: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Why or when in the course of evolution a single carboxypeptidase with both A and B specificities was abandoned in favor of multiple enzymes with more limited specificities is not known. The classification of carboxypeptidases into the A and B forms has been further expanded with the identification of the A1 and A2 isoforms in rat and humans. Carboxypeptidase A1 preferentially catalyzes aliphatic COOH-terminal residues of peptide substrates, while the A2-type selectively acts on the bulkier aromatic COOH-terminal residues, being the only isoform that shows specificity toward tryptophan (2Gardell S.J.

Carboxypeptidase A2 is apparently absent from bovine pancreas, so in contrast the single carboxypeptidase gene has a relatively broad substrate specificity (2Gardell S.J. Craik C.S. Clauser E.

A number of non-digestive zinc carboxypeptidases involved in hormone and neuropeptide processing, bioactive peptide activation or inactivation, or functional modulation of regulatory proteins have also been reported in the literature expanding the field of interest in metallocarboxypeptidases (1Aviles F.X. Vendrell J. Gauash A. Coll M. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 211: 381-389Google Scholar). Aside the actinomycete enzymes (7Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) there is very limited information on the categories and genealogies of carboxypeptidases present in species other than a few animals. To date among fungi, almost all studies have focused on serine carboxypeptidases and enzymes fromAspergillus spp. (8Dal Degan F. Ribadeau-Dumas B. Breddam K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Penicillium (31Le Huerou I. Guilloteau P. Toullec R. Puigserver A. Wicker C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, an open reading frame predicted to encode a metallocarboxypeptidase (YHT2) was identified as part of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae genome project (10Johnston M. Andrews S. Brinkman R.

Science. 1994; 265: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) suggesting that these enzymes may also play a role in protein processing in fungi. Given the limited information about metallocarboxypeptidases, isolation and characterization of carboxypeptidases from species intermediate between bacteria and vertebrates might help to confirm their differential character and evolutionary pathways and to understand the molecular reasons for their specific functional properties. We report here the cDNA cloning of a carboxypeptidase A (MeCPA) that is secreted by an insect pathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae into infected tissues. M. anisopliaeproduces a very large number of isoforms of different peptidases that often hinders the rapid purification of the correct protein (11St. Leger R.J. Can. J. Bot. 1995; 73 Suppl. 1: S1119-S1125Crossref Google Scholar). Consequently, Pro-MeCPA was overexpressed in an insect cell line to produce soluble catalytically active protein in quantities amenable to functional analysis and free of any possible fungal contaminants. Similarly human carboxypeptidase A2 was expressed in Pichia pastoris in order to characterize its activation pathway and facilitate its potential for biotechnology (12Reverter D. Ventura S. Villegas V. Vendrell J. Aviles F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3535-3541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The expressed MeCPA resembled mammalian enzymes in demonstrating an A-type specificity toward aromatic and bulky aliphatic P1 side chains, and contrasted with bacteria in possessing only marginal B-type activity against charged residues. This substrate specificity was associated with hydrophobic amino acids in the S1 subsite that are mostly either the same, or conserved substitutions with those in A-type carboxypeptidases. Thus, the separation into distinct A- and B-types appears to have occurred early in the evolution of the eukaryotes, and despite distant phylogenetic relationships, hypotheses concerning structural determinants contributing to the A-type specificity of mammalian enzymes (2Gardell S.J.

Standardized mycelial inocula (5 g wet weight) from 48-h Sabouraud dextrose broth cultures were incubated with shaking (100 rpm) for 14 h in 100 ml of minimal media (0.05% KH2P04, 0.01% MgSO4, pH 6) supplemented with insect cuticle or alternate carbon and/or nitrogen sources at 1% (w/v) (13St. Leger R.J. Frank D.C. Roberts D.W. Staples R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 991-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Clean samples of cuticle from 3-day-old fifth instar Manduca sexta larvae were prepared as described previously (14St. Leger R.J. Joshi L. Bidochka M.J. Rizzo N.W. Roberts D.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cuticle was obtained from the giant cockroach (Blaberus giganteus) by extracting soft tissue from homogenized insects with sodium tetraborate (15St. Leger R.J. Joshi L. Bidochka M.J. Rizzo N.W. Roberts D.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 907-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of culture for enzyme assay were clarified by filtration through Whatman 1 filter paper and centrifugation (1,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The rate of hydrolysis against a range of carboxypeptidase substrates was continuously measured spectrophotometrically in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mNaCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. The wavelengths used to monitor the various reactions were as follows: Bz-Gly-Arg, 254 nm; Cbz1-Gly-Gly-Phe, Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu, Cbz-Gly-Gly-Ala, and Cbz-Gly-Phe, 225 nm; Cbz-Gly-Trp and Cbz-Gly-Tyr, 235 nm (2Gardell S.J.

Initial rates were obtained at substrate concentrations bracketing the K m value whenever possible. The values of the kinetic parameters,k cat and K m, were obtained by direct fit of 8 points using a nonlinear least squares regression analysis (16St. Leger R.J. Charnley A.K. Copper R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 221-232Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Bovine carboxypeptidase (Type 1) and enzyme substrates were supplied by Sigma. Differential display was used to identify genes that are induced when M. anisopliae grows on insect cuticle (17Joshi L. St. Leger R.J. Roberts D.W. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Total RNA from M. anisopliae cultures grown in the presence or absence of insect cuticle was isolated with Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center) from finely homogenized fungal mycelia and analyzed using the RNAimage mRNA Differential display kit (GenHunter) as described (17Joshi L. St. Leger R.J. Roberts D.W. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 454-base pair MeCPA PCR band differentially expressed in cuticle grown cultures (Fig. 1) was isolated, re-amplified, and ligated into pCRII (Invitrogen) and transformed into One Shot competent cells (Invitrogen). The plasmid DNA was purified using the Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen). Purified plasmid DNA fragments were sequenced using a 373 Stretch DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) on both strands. The PCR fragment was 32P-labeled by random primer and used to screen a λ ZAP II cDNA library constructed from mycelia grown on insect cuticle (17Joshi L. St. Leger R.J. Roberts D.W. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We screened a total of 10,000 plaques at high stringency using standard procedures (13St. Leger R.J. Frank D.C. Roberts D.W. Staples R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 991-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and identified 10 positive plaques that were rescued as Bluescript (Stratagene) plasmids for sequence analysis. The sequence data were analyzed in Gene Bank using BLASTX and FASTA searches and the tree was drawn using MEGALIGN in the DNASTAR program. Southern and Northern blots were performed as described previously (13St. Leger R.J. Frank D.C. Roberts D.W. Staples R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 991-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The MeCPA gene was isolated as a 1.6-kilobase DNA fragment from a Bluescript/MeCPA and ligated into the pBacPAK8 transfer vector plasmid (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf-21), were co-transfected with AcMNVP DNA (1.5 μg) and the pBacPAK8/MeCPA plasmid DNA (3 μg) using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) as described (18Groebe D.R. Chung A.E. Ho C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recombinant virus (AcMNVP/MeCPA in which the polyhedrin gene was replaced with the MeCPA gene was detected by the absence of polyhedra in infection loci of tissue culture plaques using Sf-21 cells (19Wood H.A. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1977; 29: 304-307Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The progeny recombinant virus was purified with four sequential plaque isolations. To express MeCPA in insect cells (designated BEV-MeCPA), Hi-5 cells (Invitrogen) were infected with AcMNVP/MeCPA at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque forming units per cell. MeCPA activity versus Cbz-Gly-Gly-Phe was first detected in the tissue culture medium 36 h after infection and reached a maximum titer of 24.2 mg/liter at 84 h post-infection. Harvested medium was concentrated, and the MeCPA protein was separated from proteins in the cell culture medium by affinity chromatography. A viral suspension prepared by infecting Hi-5 cells with Ac-E10 under the same conditions was used as a control. Ac-E10 is a mutant of AcMNVP which contains neither a functional polyhedrin gene nor a foreign gene insert (20Hamblin M. van Beek N.A.M. Hughes P.R. Wood H.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 3057-3062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Media samples (50 ml aliquots) were removed from infected insect cell cultures and concentrated by lyophilization. The residual solids were dissolved in 15 ml of distilled water and equilibrated with 20 mm MES, 0.1m NaCl (pH 6.0) using Centriprep-10 ultrafiltration units (Amicon, Danvers, MA). The sample was applied to a carboxypeptidase affinity column (1.5 × 9 cm2) of immobilized glygyl-l-tyrosyl-azo-benzylsuccinate (21Cueni L.B. Bazzone T.J. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). (Pierce Chemical Co.). The column was washed with 20 mm MES (pH 6.0), 0.1m NaCl and enzyme eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). MeCPA expressed in insect cells and purified by affinity chromatography was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with 0.05% Coomassie Blue, and the single 35-kDa protein band was excised with a scalpel. The gel slices were lyophilized, ground into a powder, and resuspended in a volume of water equal to one-half of the original volume. The suspension was divided into three aliquots, mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant, and injected at 14-day intervals into New Zealand White rabbits. Antibodies were affinity purified on a Affi-Gel column (Bio-Rad) and used to detect MeCPA protein by Western blot. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted as described previously (14St. Leger R.J. Joshi L. Bidochka M.J. Rizzo N.W. Roberts D.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were developed with the ProtoBlot Western blot AP system (Promega). NH2-terminal sequence analysis of proteins blotted on nylon membranes followed previously used procedures (15St. Leger R.J. Joshi L. Bidochka M.J. Rizzo N.W. Roberts D.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 907-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cuticles from fifth-instar M. sexta larvae were excised, soaked in a saturated solution of phenylthiourea (to inhibit phenoloxidase) inoculated with conidia, and following incubation for up to 48 h, processed for electron microscopy as described previously (15St. Leger R.J. Joshi L. Bidochka M.J. Rizzo N.W. Roberts D.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 907-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using antibodies to MeCPA. Ultrathin sections of LR White-embedded tissue were placed in blocking solution (15St. Leger R.J. Joshi L. Bidochka M.J. Rizzo N.W. Roberts D.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 907-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min, treated with a 10−2 dilution of Protein A-gold (particle diameter, 10 nm; Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (0.05%) and bovine serum albumin (0.02%) for 1.5 h. The sections were then washed in distilled water and stained for contrast in 4% (w/v) uranyl acetate in 50% (v/v) ethanol for 20 min. Observations were made with a Zeiss EM10 transmission electron microscope. Specificity of the labeling was determined by: (i) incubation of the sections with serum obtained before the rabbits were immunized, (ii) omission of primary antisera, and (iii) treatment with Protein A prior to treatment with Protein A-gold. A PCR product of aM. anisopliae transcript specifically expressed during growth on insect host cuticle was isolated using differential display (Fig. 1). Approximately 0.1% of the clones in a λ ZAP II cDNA library constructed from mycelia grown on insect cuticle hybridized to the radiolabeled PCR product. Complementary DNA from 10 hybridization positive clones was isolated at the preparative level and the longest clone, called MeCPA, was entirely sequenced in both directions. The nucleotide sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence of the protein (MeCPA) are shown in Fig. 2. The analyzed full-length cDNA insert contained standard 5′- and 3′-flanking regions and an open reading frame of 1254 base pairs coding for 418 amino acids. Analysis of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the primary translation product suggests the existence of a hydrophobic 23-amino acid signal peptide which is presumably cleaved during expression of the inactive zymogen. The format of the signal includes a charged residue (Arg), a core of hydrophobic residues and a helix breaking residue (Pro), five residues before a peptidase cleavage site (SPV). This is consistent with the empirical rules of fungal presecretory sequences and is similar to the NH2-terminal sequence of M. anisopliaesubtilisin proteinase (Pr1) (13St. Leger R.J. Frank D.C. Roberts D.W. Staples R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 991-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal of the BEV-expressed protein was determined by microsequencing to be GTIQAYAA. This sequence was located 99 residues from the NH2 terminus of the 418 amino acid sequence (Fig. 2). The predictedM r of the mature protein is 35,151. Southern analysis with MeCPA produced a single approximately 2-kilobase fragment (Fig. 3), indicating that it is a single copy gene as this band is too small to contain more than one gene copy. That MeCPA belongs to the A group of digestive metallocarboxypeptidases is suggested by the comparison of its overall amino acid sequence with proteins of other organisms. The most closely related proteins are human carboxypeptidase A2 (37% identity) and carboxypeptidase A1 (35% identity), rat carboxypeptidase A2 (35% identity), bovine carboxypeptidase (34% identity), and the hypothetical yeast carboxypeptidase YHT2 (33% identity). YHT2 showed 31% identity to human carboxypeptidase A2 (Fig.4). By contrast, bacterial carboxypeptidases show about 25% identity to the pancreatic enzymes (22Osterman A.L. Grishin N.V. Smulevitch S.V. Matz M.V. Zagnitko O.P. Revina L.P. Stepanov V.M. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fungal carboxypeptidases show much less overall sequence similarities to the regulatory enzymes (Fig.5). In fact MeCPA and human carboxypeptidases share only a 15% amino acid identity with the non-digestive mammalian carboxypeptidases.Figure 5Position of MeCPA in a phylogenic tree of the metallocarboxypeptidase superfamily.

These include residues involved in zinc binding (His69, Glu72, and His196), catalysis (Glu270 and Arg127), and substrate anchoring and positioning (Arg71, Asn144, Arg145, Pro205, Ile247, Tyr248, and Asp256). However, Asn144 and Arg145 are replaced by Asp and His in YHT2 so these particular residues can no longer be regarded as strictly invariant in zinc carboxypeptidases. The S2 (Arg71, Ser197, Tyr198, and Ser199) and S3 (Phe279) subsites involved in binding and torsion of peptide substrates are the same in pancreatic enzymes, MeCPA and YHT2, although they are variable among the regulatory zinc carboxypeptidases (22Osterman A.L. Grishin N.V. Smulevitch S.V. Matz M.V. Zagnitko O.P. Revina L.P. Stepanov V.M. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Variations between carboxypeptidases occur at residues that form the S1 specificity pocket (positions 194, 203, 243, 250, 253, 255, and 268) and are responsible for the observed differences in primary specificity (2Gardell S.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6906-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In Table I substitutions in these positions are compared for MeCPA, YHT2, and zinc carboxypeptidases with different specificity types. The B-type specificity for positively charged residues is determined by a negatively charged residue (Asp) in positions 253 or 255,i.e. at the center of the binding pocket of the catalytic domain (22Osterman A.L. Grishin N.V. Smulevitch S.V. Matz M.V. Zagnitko O.P. Revina L.P. Stepanov V.M. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Faming Z. Kobe B. Stewart C.B. Rutter W.J. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24606-24612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MeCPA and A-type carboxypeptidases have no equivalent Asp residue; they possesses a hydrophobic Ile residue at position 255 (Leu in the yeast enzyme) that is believed to be a critical parameter in determining a specificity for hydrophobic substrates (25Faming Z. Kobe B. Stewart C.B. Rutter W.J. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24606-24612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the presence of an Asp residue at position 194 in MeCPA and YHT2, replacing a hydrophobic residue in A-types, will decrease the hydrophobic character of the active site. MeCPA resembles the human A-type enzymes in possessing the flexible Met at position 203, and also resembles the A2 isoform and bovine carboxypeptidase in possessing small Gly and Ser residues at positions 253 and 254 (Fig. 4). These substitutions should provide a stronger hydrophobic character and favor the enlargement of the specificity cavity to facilitate the recognition of substrates with bulkier aromatic residues (23Catasus L. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Carreira S. Puigserver A. Billeter M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6651-6657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, while also adding to the pockets hydrophobic character, the Val250 in MeCPA will reduce the pocket size versus the A2 form. MeCPA resembles most other carboxypeptidases in possessing a Thr residue at 268, in place of Ala in carboxypeptidase A2.Table IAmino acid variations in S1-subsite of Zn-carboxypeptidasesSpecificityPositionsTypeEnzymes194203243250253254255268AHuman Cp1SerMetIleAlaSerThrIleThrHuman CpIleMetIleAlaGlySerIleAlaBos CpBASerLeuIleAlaGlySerIleThrMeCPAAspMetValValGlySerIleThrYHT2AspLeuAlaGlySerAlaLeuQBBos CPBBThrLeuGlyAlaGlySerAspThrA + BTherm CPTThrLeuAlaThrAspMetThrThrStrep CPAAspLeuSerThrSerIleAspThrExcept for BosCPBB (bovine carboxypeptidase B, P00732) enzyme abbreviations are defined in the legend to Fig. 5.

Numeration is given according to BosCPBA sequence. To confirm that the protein encoded by MeCPA is a carboxypeptidase, we expressed MeCPA cDNA in insect cells and compared the kinetic properties of affinity purified enzyme (Fig. 6) with bovine carboxypeptidase against typical substrates for carboxypeptidases (TableII). For both enzymes the most effectively hydrolyzed substrates contained P1 phenylalanine, and substituting with leucine, tyrosine, or tryptophan reduced activity. The catalytic efficiencies (k cat /K m) of MeCPA toward Cbz-Gly-Phe and Cbz-Gly-Trp substrates is higher than bovine carboxypeptidase by 1.8- and 2.0-fold, respectively, reflected primarily in increased K m values exhibited by MeCPA. The catalytic efficiency of bovine carboxypeptidase toward the Tyr substrate is 3.3-fold higher than MeCPA reflected in bothK m and K cat values. TheK cat values of MeCPA and bovine carboxypeptidase are approximately the same for Cbz-Gly-Gly-Phe and Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu, although the K m values of MeCPA are lower than bovine carboxypeptidase by 1.7- and 4.5-fold, respectively. MeCPA showed 100-fold less activity against typical substrates for carboxypeptidase B (Hippuryl-Arg, Cbz-Gly-Arg) compared with Cbz-Gly-Phe, and no activity against aminopeptidase (p-nitroanilide derivatives of Ala, Leu, and Pro) or endoprotease (Hide protein azure, casein) substrates.Table IIKinetic constants for substrate hydrolysis by M. anisopliae carboxypeptidase and bovine carboxypeptidaseSubstrateMeCPABovine CPBAK Mk cat(k cat/K M) × 10−5K Mk cat(k cat/K M) × 10−5μms−1m−1s−1μms−1m−1s−1Cbz-Gly-Phe373 ± 1127.8 ± 1.20.74846 ± 4834.5 ± 1.60.41Cbz-Gly-Tyr615 ± 87.6 ± 0.30.12300 ± 1612.0 ± 0.60.40Cbz-Gly-Trp454 ± 2212.6 ± 0.40.272320 ± 2531.6 ± 2.20.13Cbz-Gly-Gly-Phe96 ± 6128 ± 413.33166 ± 11156 ± 4.39.40Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu115 ± 1964 ± 32.97974 ± 6167.6 ± 2.50.69Cbz-Gly-Gly-AlaTraTr, low rates of hydrolysis of Cbz-Gly-Gly-Ala precluded determination of kinetic constants.TrAssayed in aqueous buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5m NaCl, pH 7.5) as described in the text.a Tr, low rates of hydrolysis of Cbz-Gly-Gly-Ala precluded determination of kinetic constants.

https://openalex.org/W2062652555,"Members of the Mycobacterium aviumcomplex are the most frequently encountered opportunistic bacterial pathogens among patients in the advanced stage of AIDS. Two clinical isolates of the same strain, numbers 397 and 417, were obtained from an AIDS patient with disseminated M. avium complex infection before and after treatment with a regimen of clarithromycin and ethambutol. To identify the biochemical consequence of drug treatment, the expression and chemical composition of their major cell wall constituents, the arabinogalactan, lipoarabinomannan, and the surface glycopeptidolipids (GPL), were critically examined. Through thin layer chromatography, mass spectrometry, and chemical analysis, it was found that the GPL expression profiles differ significantly in that several apolar GPLs were overexpressed in the clinically resistant 417 isolate at the expense of the serotype 1 polar GPL, which was the single predominant band in the ethambutol-susceptible 397 isolate. Thus, instead of additional rhamnosylation on the 6-deoxytalose (6-dTal) appendage to give the serotype 1-specific disaccharide hapten, the accumulation of this nonextended apolar GPL probably provided more precursor substrate available for further nonsaccharide substitutions including a higher degree of O-methylation to give 3-O-Me-6-dTal and the unusual 4-O-sulfation on 6-dTal. Further data showed that this alteration effectively neutralized ethambutol, which is known to inhibit arabinan synthesis. Thus, in contrast with derived Emb-resistant mutants ofMycobacterium smegmatis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are devoid of a surface GPL layer, the lipoarabinomannan from resistant 417 isolate grown in the presence of this drug was not apparently truncated."
https://openalex.org/W1527692652,"Vpr, an accessory gene of HIV-1, induces cell cycle abnormality with accumulation at G2/M phase and increased ploidy. Since abnormality of mitotic checkpoint control provides a molecular basis of genomic instability, we studied the effects of Vpr on genetic integrity using a stable clone, named MIT-23, in which Vpr expression is controlled by the tetracycline-responsive promoter. Treatment of MIT-23 cells with doxycycline (DOX) induced Vpr expression with a giant multinuclear cell formation. Increased micronuclei (MIN) formation was also detected in these cells. Abolishment of Vpr expression by DOX removal induced numerous asynchronous cytokinesis in the multinuclear cells with leaving MIN in cytoplasm, suggesting that the transient Vpr expression could cause genetic unbalance. Consistent with this expectation, MIT-23 cells, originally pseudodiploid cells, became aneuploid after repeated expression of Vpr. Experiments using deletion mutants of Vpr revealed that the domain inducing MIN formation as well as multinucleation was located in the carboxy-terminal region of Vpr protein. These results suggest that Vpr induces genomic instability, implicating the possible role in the development of AIDS-related malignancies."

We have investigated the potential role of gp130RB13-6 in glial differentiation by transfection of three cell lines of different origin that do not express endogenous gp130RB13-6 (NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts; C6 and BT7Ca rat glioma cells) with the cDNA encoding gp130RB13-6. The effect of gp130RB13-6 expression was analyzed in terms of overall cell morphology, the expression of glial cell-specific marker proteins, and invasiveness. Transfectant sublines, consisting of 100% gp130RB13-6-positive cells, exhibited an altered, bipolar morphology. Fascicular aggregates of fibroblastoid cells subsequently developed into mesh-like patterns. Contrary to the parental NIH-3T3 and BT7Ca cells, the transfectant cells invaded into collagen type I. As shown by immunofluorescence staining of the transfectant sublines as well as of primary cultures composed of gp130RB13-6-positive and -negative cells, expression of gp130RB13-6 induced coexpression of proteins typical for glial cells and their precursors, i.e., glial fibrillary acidic protein, the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor, and the neural proteins Thy-1, Ran-2, and S-100. In accordance with its expression in the immature rat nervous system, gp130RB13-6 may thus have a significant role in the glial differentiation program and its subversion in neurooncogenesis.—Deissler, H., Blass-Kampmann, S., Bruyneel, E., Mareel, M., Rajewsky, M.

https://openalex.org/W2103811827,"ADP-ribosylation factor-related protein (ARP) is a membrane-associated GTPase with remote similarity to the family of ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF). In a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify proteins interacting with ARP, we isolated a partial cDNA of the ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor mSec7-1/cytohesin encoding its N terminus and most of the Sec7 domain (codons 1–200). ARP and ARP-Q79L (GTPase-negative ARP) exhibited a higher affinity to mSec7-1-(1–200) than ARP-T31N (nucleotide exchange-defective ARP) in the two-hybrid assay. Similarly, full-length [35S]mSec7-1/cytohesin was specifically adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose loaded with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ARP-Q79L, GST-ARP, or GST-ARP-T31N, the latter exhibiting the lowest binding affinity. Overexpression of ARP-Q79L, but not of ARP-T31N, in COS-7 cells reduced the fluorescence from co-expressed green fluorescent protein fused with mSec7-1/cytohesin or mSec7-2/ARNO in plasma membranes as detected by deconvolution microscopy. Recombinant ARP and ARP-Q79L, but not ARP-T31N, inhibited the phospholipase D (PLD) activity stimulated by mSec7-2/ARNO and ARF in a system of isolated membranes. Furthermore, transfection of HEK-293 cells with ARP or ARP-Q79L, but not ARP-T31N, inhibited the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-3 induced PLD stimulation and translocation of ARF from cytosol to membranes. These data suggest that the GTP-bound form of ARP specifically binds mSec7-1/cytohesin, and that ARP may be involved in a pathway inhibiting the ARF-controlled activity of PLD.

ARP and ARP-Q79L (GTPase-negative ARP) exhibited a higher affinity to mSec7-1-(1–200) than ARP-T31N (nucleotide exchange-defective ARP) in the two-hybrid assay. Similarly, full-length [35S]mSec7-1/cytohesin was specifically adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose loaded with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ARP-Q79L, GST-ARP, or GST-ARP-T31N, the latter exhibiting the lowest binding affinity. Overexpression of ARP-Q79L, but not of ARP-T31N, in COS-7 cells reduced the fluorescence from co-expressed green fluorescent protein fused with mSec7-1/cytohesin or mSec7-2/ARNO in plasma membranes as detected by deconvolution microscopy. Recombinant ARP and ARP-Q79L, but not ARP-T31N, inhibited the phospholipase D (PLD) activity stimulated by mSec7-2/ARNO and ARF in a system of isolated membranes. Furthermore, transfection of HEK-293 cells with ARP or ARP-Q79L, but not ARP-T31N, inhibited the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-3 induced PLD stimulation and translocation of ARF from cytosol to membranes. These data suggest that the GTP-bound form of ARP specifically binds mSec7-1/cytohesin, and that ARP may be involved in a pathway inhibiting the ARF-controlled activity of PLD.

Stimulation of PLD and formation of its product, phosphatidic acid, appears to be a crucial signal in intracellular vesicle formation and trafficking (8Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G.

PLD is stimulated by receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity as well as by G protein-coupled receptors through ARF, Rho, and/or protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathways (reviewed in Refs. 6Cockcroft S.

In HEK-293 cells expressing the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-3 (M3 receptor), M3 receptor-induced PLD stimulation is mediated by ARF and Rho proteins, but is independent of PKC activation (11Schmidt M.

So far, two mammalian PLD isoforms with different subcellular localization and regulatory characteristics have been identified. PLD1 (with the two splice variants PLD1a and PLD1b) was found in the perinuclear region, and is markedly stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), PKC, ARF, and Rho GTPases (14Hammond S.M.

In contrast, PLD2 is associated with the plasma membrane, and appears to be less responsive to ARF than PLD1 (16Colley W.C. Sung T.C Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D.

ARF-related protein (ARP) is a 25-kDa GTPase with remote similarity to the ARF family (33% and 39% identical amino acids with ARF1 and ARF-like 3, respectively). Its cDNA was isolated in a PCR-based cloning approach (19Schürmann A. Maßmann S. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30657-30663Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which led to the identification of four other ARF-like GTPases (20Schürmann A. Breiner M. Becker W. Huppertz C.

Acta. 1996; 1308: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on the presence of conserved residues which are characteristic for the ARF family, in particular Trp-86, Asp-101, Asp-104, and Arg-107, the GTPase was assigned to the extended ARF family. However, ARP exhibits features that are unusual in the ARF family, i.e. its rather high intrinsic GTPase activity (19Schürmann A. Maßmann S. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30657-30663Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Compared with other GTPases, guanine nucleotide exchange of ARP is slow, suggesting that this function is catalyzed by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. In the present study, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system in order to identify proteins interacting with ARP, and have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a partial sequence of cytohesin, a mammalian homologue of the yeast protein Sec7. Cytohesin belongs to a small family of cytosolic adapter proteins (here referred to as mSec7-1/cytohesin, mSec7-2/ARNO, and mSec7-3/GRP1; Ref. 23Telemenakis I. Benseler F. Südhoff T.C. Brose N. Eur.

Thus, we assumed that the interaction of ARP with a mammalian Sec7 isoform might modulate the ARF-mediated signal transduction, and have employed the assay of M3 receptor- or ARF-stimulated PLD activity (11Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Wahn F. Tapp E. Grannass A. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) as a detection system in order to characterize the potential role of ARP in this pathway. Evidence is presented here suggesting that ARP-GTP inhibits the activation of PLD by ARF in isolated membranes, inhibits the M3 receptor-mediated stimulation of PLD in intact cells, and also produces a subcellular re-distribution of co-expressed mSec7-1/cytohesin or mSec7-2/ARNO. Thus, ARP may be involved in a signaling pathway inhibiting the ARF-controlled activity of PLD. For subcloning of cDNAs, suitable restriction sites were used or introduced by PCR with primers containing the desired site. All PCR-generated constructs were controlled by sequencing. ARP-T31N, ARP-Q79L, ARL4-T34N, and ARL4-Q79L mutants were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Ref. 31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30657-30663Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) into pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) for preparation of recombinant proteins, or into pCMV for expression in mammalian cells. For assay of the yeast two-hybrid interaction, the plasmids pBTM116 and pVP16 were used (32Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). The plasmids pLexA-ARP, pLexA-ARP-T31N, pLexA-ARP-Q79L, pLexA-ARL4, pLexA-ARL4-T34N, and pLexA-ARL4-Q79L were constructed by inserting a PCR-generated fragment of the ARP, ARP-T31N, ARP-Q79L, ARL4, ARL4-T34N, and ARL4-Q79L cDNA into the EcoRI site of the pBTM116 plasmid. The resulting plasmids express ARP as a fusion protein with the DNA binding domain of LexA connected by a short linker (amino acid sequence: EFRSGRSSSST). The plasmids pLexA-Rab6 and pLexA-lamin (33Janoueix-Lerosey I. Jollivet F. Camonis J. Marche P.N. Goud B. J. Biol.

Goud (Institut Pasteur, Unité de Génétique Somatique, Paris, France). pVP16-mSec7-(1–52) and pVP16-mSec7-(1–150) were generated by subcloning of the respective cDNA fragments (23Telemenakis I. Benseler F. Südhoff T.C. Brose N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 143-149PubMed Google Scholar) into theBamHI/NotI sites of pVP16. Plasmids of mSec7-1/cytohesin and mSec7-2/ARNO cDNA subcloned into pGEX-KG or the GFP expression vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) were gifts from Dr. N. Brose (Max Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany). mSec7-2/ARNO cDNA subcloned into pGEX-2T was obtained from Dr. P. Chardin (CNRS, Institute de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Valbonne, France). For preparation of recombinant ARF1, cDNA was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcGHLT (PharMingen, Hamburg, Germany). Yeast strains, plasmids, and library for the yeast two-hybrid screen were obtained from Dr. B. Goud. The genotype of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain L40 isMAT a trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ (32Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in rich medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) or in synthetic minimal medium with appropriate supplements. The yeast reporter strain L40, which contains the reporter geneslacZ and HIS3 downstream of the binding sequences for LexA, was transformed with pLexA-ARP-T31N or pLexA-ARP-Q79L and a mouse embryo pVP16 cDNA library (34Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) with the lithium acetate method (35Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P.

Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). Double transformants were plated to synthetic medium lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan, uracil, and lysine. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. His+ colonies were patched on selective plates and assayed for β-galactosidase activity by a filter assay (36Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L.V. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared from colonies displaying aHIS +/lacZ+ phenotype by electrotransformation of HB101 cells and used to re-transform the L40 strain containing pLexA-ARP, pLexA-ARP-T31N, pLexA-ARP-Q79L, pLexARL4, pLexA-Rab6, and pLexA-lamin, respectively, to test for specificity. For assay of β-galactosidase activity, transformants were grown in histidine-containing medium, and were lysed and assayed as described (37Hata Y. Südhof T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α was transformed with cDNAs of ARP, ARP-T31N, ARP-Q79L, mSec7-1/cytohesin, or mSec7-2/ARNO subcloned in the pGEX vector (Pharmacia), and an exponentially growing culture was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-d-thiogalactoside. After incubation at room temperature for 4–6 h, cells were lysed and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. GST fusion proteins were isolated by adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 2 h at 4 °C. In some experiments (Fig. 4), recombinant ARP fusion proteins were loaded with GTP (ARP, ARP-Q79L) or GDP (ARP-T31N) by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, the beads were washed with phosphate buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.4)), and fusion proteins were eluted with buffer containing 30 mm glutathione in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0), or by treatment of the Sepharose beads with thrombin (1 unit/100 μg of fusion protein). Recombinant ARF1 was prepared by transfection of Sf9 cells with cDNA subcloned in the vector pAcGHLT, and isolated by adsorption of the GST fusion protein to glutathione-Sepharose. [35S]Methionine-labeled mSec7-1/cytohesin was prepared by in vitro translation with a kit (TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system) from Promega (Madison, WI) according to instructions of the manufacturer. Samples of 4 μl of the reticulocyte lysate were added to 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads loaded with approximately 50 μg of recombinant GST-ARP, GST-ARP-Q79L, or GST-ARP-T31N, and were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 100 μl. The beads were washed four times with Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl, and were boiled with Laemmli buffer. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gels) and detected by autoradiography. COS-7 cells were seeded at 7 × 104cells/coverslip and transfected with 2.5 μg of the plasmids harboring the GFP-mSec7 and ARP constructs with the aid of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 30 h of culture, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min, washed, and mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Images were obtained with a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) with exposures of 0.2 and 0.4 s and HQ fluorescein filters from Chroma (Brattleboro, VT). Microscope automation and image analysis were performed with ISEE Inovision (Durham, NC) and Adobe Photoshop software (Mountain View, CA). For each cell, a series of images spaced 4 μm apart through the vertical axis was obtained. Out of focus light was removed using the nearest neighbor deconvolution algorithm (38Castleman K.R. Digital Image Processing. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1996Google Scholar). Background was subtracted and contrast was stretched with the Adobe Photoshop software. Guanine nucleotide binding to recombinant GTPases was assayed by a previously described procedure (39Kahn R.A. Kern F.G. Clark J. Gelmann E.P. Rulka C. J. Biol.

Samples of 15 pmol of GTPase were incubated at 37 °C in a buffer containing 4 μm [35S]GTPγS (4 × 105 cpm/sample), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 3.1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μg of bovine serum albumin, 3 mm dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and 0.1% (w/v) sodium cholate in a total volume of 100 μl. The incubation was terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mmNaCl, and 25 mm MgCl2. The samples were filtered through nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius GmbH, Göttingen, Germany; pore size 0.2 μm) and washed four times with 1 ml of fresh buffer. Radioactivity on the filters was determined by scintillation counting in a water-compatible scintillation mixture (Ready Protein, Beckman, Fullerton, CA). HEK-293 cells overexpressing M3 receptors were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium as described previously (11Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and were transfected by incubation with co-precipitates of calcium phosphate and DNA from the different plasmids. The transfection efficiency (50–80%) was controlled by co-transfection with pSVβ-gal (Promega) and histochemical detection of β-galactosidase activity. All assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Overexpression of ARP was confirmed by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates as described (19Schürmann A. Maßmann S. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30657-30663Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Membranes of HEK-293 cells were prepared by nitrogen cavitation and differential centrifugation as described previously (30Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Wahn F. Tapp E. Grannass A. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J.

For generation of a micellar lipid preparation, [3H]phosphatidylcholine was mixed with PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a molar ratio of 8:1, dried, and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 3 mm EGTA, 80 mm KCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The suspension was sonicated on ice, and samples containing the membranes with the indicated agents and/or proteins were added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 100 μl containing (final concentrations) 200 μm [3H]phosphatidylcholine (approximately 0.5 × 106 cpm/sample), 25 μmPtdIns(4,5)P2, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% (v/v) ethanol. The reaction was stopped with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PtdEtOH) formed was isolated and analyzed as described (11Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D.

Thereafter, cells were washed twice with a buffer containing 118 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmglucose, and 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The cells were treated as indicated with 1 mm carbachol or 100 nmphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in the presence or absence of ethanol (400 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Total phospholipids and [3H]PtdEtOH were isolated as described previously (11Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J.

Translocation of ARF in HEK-293 cells was assayed with a previously published procedure (12Rümenapp U. Geiszt M. Wahn F. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with carbachol for 10 min, and were permeabilized with 10 μmdigitonin for 15 min. After centrifugation of cells (15,000 ×g, 10 min), the ARF content of the supernatant was assayed as described by immunoblotting. Antiserum against recombinant ARF1 was provided by Dr. J. B. Helms (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany). Densitometry of bands corresponding to ARF was performed with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify proteins interacting with ARP, we isolated a cDNA clone that induced growth oflacZ-positive colonies on histidine-free agar plates. The clone harbored 626 nucleotides of the mouse mSec7-1/cytohesin cDNA (accession no. AF051337) fused to the VP16 cDNA; the translate of this cDNA contained the N-terminal coiled-coil domain and the Sec7 domain of cytohesin (codons 1–200) fused in-frame with the VP16 activation domain. Cytohesin belongs to a small family of cytosolic adapter proteins with nucleotide exchange-accelerating activity for ARF (24Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L.

As is illustrated in Fig.1 A, the clone induced growth of colonies on histidine-free agar plates when co-transfected with pLex-ARP or with pLex-ARP-Q79L (GTPase-negative mutant); growth of colonies co-transfected with pLex-ARP-T31N (exchange-defective mutant) was much slower. When transferred to nitrocellulose filters, these colonies tested positive for the lacZ reporter (data not shown). Similarly, in cells grown in suspension in histidine-containing medium (Fig. 1 B), pLex-ARP and pLex-ARP-Q79L induced a significant β-galactosidase activity that was higher than that of pLex-ARP-T31N transfectants. Thus, the protein encoded by the partial mSec7-1/cytohesin cDNA appears to bind ARP-GTP with a higher affinity than ARP-GDP. mSec7-1/cytohesin (1–200) also exhibited some interaction with lamin C (Fig. 1, A and B). However, full (mSec7-(1–52)) or partial (mSec7-(1–150)) deletion of the Sec7 domain suppressed the interaction with ARP but not with lamin C (Fig. 1 B). Thus, lamin C appears to interact with the coiled-coil domain of cytohesin, whereas the Sec7 domain seems necessary for the specific interaction with ARP. Furthermore, no interaction was observed between mSec7-1-(1–200) and the GTPases ARL4 or Rab6. In order to further demonstrate the interaction of ARP with mSec7-1/cytohesin, we used glutathione-Sepharose loaded with recombinant GST-ARP constructs, and assayed the binding of full-length35S-labeled mSec7-1/cytohesin prepared by in vitro translation. As is illustrated in Fig.2 A, recombinant GST-ARP-Q79L adsorbed a significant portion of the tracer, whereas no binding was detected to GST alone or to an unrelated protein (Bcl2). In addition, Sepharose loaded with GST-ARP-Q79L failed to adsorb an unrelated labeled protein, Bcl2 (Fig. 2 A), ruling out nonspecific stickiness of the GTPase. An additional band at approximately 40 kDa, which was also specifically adsorbed, appears to be incompletely translated mSec7-1/cytohesin; according to its size, this product should contain the full Sec7 domain. Fig. 2 B illustrates the quantitative evaluation of a series of experiments comparing the different ARP constructs. The highest binding was found with the GTPase-negative mutant ARP-Q79L. The exchange-defective mutant ARP-T31N bound significant, but much lower, amounts of mSec7-1/cytohesin than ARP-Q79L. It should be noted that the wild-type ARP employed in this experiment carried GTP and GDP at a ratio of approximately 1:3 (19Schürmann A. Maßmann S. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30657-30663Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, these data are consistent with the conclusion that mSec7-1/cytohesin specifically binds the GTP-loaded ARP with a higher affinity than the GDP-loaded form. In order to demonstrate the interaction of ARP with Sec7 domain proteins in a system of intact mammalian cells, COS-7-cells were co-transfected with ARP and GFP-tagged mSec7-1/cytohesin or mSec7-2/ARNO. Since we assumed that the specific interaction of the proteins might produce a re-distribution of the mSec7 isoforms, the subcellular localization of the GFP fluorescence was analyzed by deconvolution microscopy. Deconvolution microscopy eliminates most light from portions of the specimen not in the focal plane, thereby allowing a more precise localization of proteins in cells. When cells were co-transfected with GFP-mSec7-1/cytohesin or GFP-mSec7-2/ARNO plus the bland pCMV vector, an essentially continuous labeling of the cellular periphery, i.e. of the plasma membrane, with the GFP fluorescence was observed, in addit"
https://openalex.org/W2058496516,"Many sorting stations along the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways are acidified, suggesting a role for pH regulation in protein traffic. However, the function of acidification in individual compartments has been difficult to examine because global pH perturbants affect all acidified organelles in the cell and also have numerous side effects. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a method to selectively perturb the pH of a subset of acidified compartments. We infected HeLa cells with a recombinant adenovirus encoding influenza virus M2 protein (an acid-activated ion channel that dissipates proton gradients across membranes) and measured the effects on various steps in protein transport. At low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.), delivery of influenza hemagglutinin from thetrans-Golgi network to the cell surface was blocked, but there was almost no effect on the rate of recycling of internalized transferrin. At higher m.o.i., transferrin recycling was inhibited, suggesting increased accumulation of M2 in endosomes. Interestingly, even at the higher m.o.i., M2 expression had no effect on lysosome morphology or on EGF degradation, suggesting that lysosomal pH was not compromised by M2 expression. However, delivery of newly synthesized cathepsin D to lysosomes was slowed in cells expressing active M2, suggesting that acidification of the TGN and endosomes is important for efficient delivery of lysosomal hydrolases. Fluorescence labeling using a pH-sensitive dye confirmed the reversible effect of M2 on the pH of a subset of acidified compartments in the cell. The ability to dissect the role of acidification in individual steps of a complex pathway should be useful for numerous other studies on protein processing and transport.

Intriguingly, some of the major sorting stations in cells, the trans-Golgi network (TGN)1 and endosomes, are known to be acidified, and pH regulation is known to be required for some functions of these organelles. For example, acidic pH is required for the proper sorting and processing of regulated secretory proteins and hormones in the TGN of endocrine cells (1Xu H. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22875-22881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Furthermore, acidification of early endosomes is thought to be necessary for the dissociation of some internalized ligands from their receptors (3Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). However, outside of a few specific examples, the role of acidification in protein trafficking is not well understood. In part, this is due to the inherent problems presented by the use of global pH perturbants such as weak bases or the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) and concanamycins A and B. These inhibitors disrupt the pH of all acidified compartments in the cell, have dramatic effects on organelle morphology, and are only slowly reversible. In addition, BafA1 may differentially affect V-ATPase isoforms in some organelles, further complicating interpretation of results (4Chatterjee D. Chakraborty M. Leit M. Neff L. Jamsa-Kellokumpu S.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 533-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, at least some cells can become rapidly resistant to treatment with concanamycin (6Temesvari L.A. Rodriguez-Paris J.M. Bush J.M. Zhang L. Cardelli J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1479-1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these complications may account for the vast discrepancies between different studies on the effects on biosynthetic and endocytic traffic when acidification is disrupted (7Yoshimori T.

We have taken a different approach to dissect the function of acidification in transport through individual compartments in the cell. We have expressed the M2 protein of influenza virus in cells and examined its effects on transport. M2 is an acid-activated proton-selective channel formed by the self-association of 97 amino acid single membrane-spanning proteins into tetramers (16Sugrue R.J. Hay A.J. Virology. 1991; 180: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 17Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1991; 183: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 18Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J.

Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Unlike global perturbants, M2 expression should affect the pH of only those acidified compartments in which it is present. Moreover, M2 activity and its effects on transport can be rapidly and reversibly modulated using the specific ion channel blocker BL-1743 (22Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Luo G. Shaughnessy M.A. Mullaney D.

Cell. 1998; 8: 2477-2490Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that intracellular M2 is localized to the TGN and apical recycling endosomes of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and selectively affects transport of itinerant proteins through these but not through other normally acidified compartments (24Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2477-2490Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 2J. R. Henkel and O. A. Weisz, unpublished observations. Here we have expanded our studies to examine the effects of M2 on nonpolarized cells. Interestingly, in these cells we find that the effect of M2 in different subcellular compartments can be controlled by adjusting the expression level of M2. Furthermore, we can rapidly and reversibly inactivate M2 ion channel activity. This flexibility makes M2 expression a useful tool with which to probe the role of acidification in protein sorting and delivery. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Generation and characterization of E1-substituted recombinant adenoviruses encoding Rostock M2 in the correct and reverse orientations (AV-M2 and AV-M2rev, respectively), influenza hemagglutinin (AV-HA), and the tetracycline transactivator (AV-TA) are described in Ref. 24Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2477-2490Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar. Cells were plated (3 × 105/35-mm dish or 1 × 105/12-mm well) the day before infection. Cells were washed with calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2(PBS-M). After 5 min at room temperature, the PBS-M was removed, and 400 μl of PBS-M (200 μl for 12-mm wells) containing recombinant adenovirus was added. Cells infected with AV-M2 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100 received AV-TA at a m.o.i. of 50, whereas cells infected with AV-M2 at a m.o.i. of 500 received AV-TA at a m.o.i. of 100. The dishes were rocked briefly by hand, and the cells were returned to the incubator for 1–2 h. Mock-infected cells were treated identically except that virus was omitted during the incubation period. Dishes were then rinsed with PBS-M, and cells were incubated overnight in growth medium. The M2 ion channel inhibitors amantadine (AMT, Sigma; 5 μm) or BL-1743 (gift of Dr. Mark Krystal, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Wallingford, CT; 5 μm) were added as 1000-fold concentrated stocks prepared in 95% ethanol at this step or in subsequent steps where indicated to inhibit M2 activity. Experiments were initiated at 18–24 h postinfection. Surface delivery of newly synthesized HA was performed as described in (23Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were coinfected with AV-M2 or AV-M2rev, AV-TA, and AV-HA (m.o.i. 40) as described above. The following day, cells were rinsed once with PBS, then starved for 30 min in medium A (cysteine-free, methionine-free MEM containing 0.35 g/liter NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm MES, pH 7.0; Ref. 25Sakaguchi T. Leser G.P. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 733-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). AMT was added to the indicated samples at the beginning of the starvation and included during the pulse and chase periods. Cells were metabolically labeled with 50–100 μCi/ml EXPRE35S35S (NEN Life Science Products) in the same medium, then chased for 2 h at 19 °C in the same medium supplemented with four times the normal amount of cysteine and methionine (medium B). At various times, dishes were removed, rapidly chilled to 0 °C by rinsing with ice-cold PBS, and incubated on ice for 30 min in 1 ml medium B containing 100 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min. Trypsin cleaves HA into two subunits (HA1 and HA2) that remain associated via disulfide bonds during immunoprecipitation. Trypsinization was stopped by incubating the cells twice for 10 min with ice-cold medium B containing 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were then rinsed with PBS and lysed in 0.5 ml of detergent solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 62.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 0.13 TIU/ml aprotinin and 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Lysates were centrifuged briefly to remove nuclei, and SDS was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.2%. HA was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody Fc125 (23Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and antibody-antigen complexes were collected using fixedStaphylococcus aureus (Calbiochem). Where indicated, samples were treated with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as described previously (23Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the percentage of cleaved HA was quantitated using a phosphorimager (GS-363 Molecular Imager System, Bio-Rad). HeLa cells were mock-infected or infected with recombinant adenovirus as described above. The following day, cells were depleted of intracellular stores of transferrin (Tf) by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in MEM/BSA (MEM, Hanks' balanced salt solution, 0.6% BSA, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4) and 125I-labeled iron-loaded human Tf (∼5 μg/ml; ∼5 × 106 cpm/μg) was internalized for 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times rapidly and twice for 5 min each with ice-cold MEM/BSA, then incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 min to allow receptor internalization. The medium was replaced with prewarmed MEM/BSA and the cells incubated at 37 °C. At the designated times, the medium was collected and replaced. After the final time point, cells were lysed in detergent solution and the amount of 125I-labeled Tf in all samples was determined using a γ counter (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, IL). The kinetics of transferrin recycling were calculated by determining the cumulative percentage of preinternalized transferrin released into the medium at each time point. HeLa cells were mock-infected or infected with recombinant adenovirus as described above. AMT was added to the indicated samples immediately after infection and included in subsequent steps. The following day, cells were incubated with125I-labeled EGF (0.5 μm in MEM/BSA; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 0 °C. Cells were washed three times on ice for five min each with MEM/BSA, rinsed an additional three times, and then incubated with prewarmed medium. Chloroquine (50 μg/ml) was added to the indicated samples at this time. At various times, the medium was collected and replaced; at the end of the time course, the cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration added as a 100% w/v stock; Sigma) was added, and the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were then centrifuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C, and the radioactivity in the supernatants and pellets counted using a γ counter. The rate of EGF degradation was determined by calculating the cumulative release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts into the medium over time. Indirect immunofluorescence of HeLa cells was performed as described previously (23Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed once with PBS, fixed for 20 min at ambient temperature in 3% paraformaldehyde, then incubated briefly with PBS containing 10 mm glycine and 0.02% sodium azide (PBS-G). Where indicated, cells were permeabilized for 3 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS-G. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.25% ovalbumin in PBS-G prior to incubation with antibodies. M2 was detected using the monoclonal antibody 5C4 (a generous gift of Dr. Robert Lamb, Northwestern University) at a dilution of 1:250 followed by Cy3-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (2 mg/ml, 1:1000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., Avondale, PA). Cells were viewed using a Nikon Optiphot microscope (Fryer Company, Inc., Carpentersville, IL) and images were acquired using a Hamamatsu C5985 chilled CCD camera (8 bit, 756 × 483 pixels; Hamamatsu Photonics Systems, Bridgewater, NJ). To qualitatively assess the effect of M2 expression on organelle pH, we incubated mock- or AV-M2-infected HeLa cells with 5 μm LysoSensor (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in MEM/BSA. Acidified compartments were visualized using an Olympus Provis microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) using a triple pass (blue/green/red) cube, which allows excitation at 384 nm and collection at 540 nm. Images were collected digitally to a Sony 3 chip color CCD camera (Sony 970; Sony Electronics, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with hardwired on chip integration circuitry. In each experiment images were collected over 256 grayscales for each color, for 3 video frames. The effects of chloroquine (200 μg/ml) and AMT (10 μm) on the fluorescence patterns of mock-infected and M2-expressing samples were determined after 1-h and 15-min incubations, respectively. HeLa cells cultured in 35-mm dishes were infected with adenoviruses as described above. The following day, cells were starved, radiolabeled for 20 min with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in medium A, then chased for the indicated times in medium B. The medium was collected and a 5-fold concentrated stock of detergent solution supplemented with aprotinin was added to a final concentration of 1×. Cells were solubilized in detergent solution as described above and samples were incubated with anti-cathepsin D antibody (Calbiochem). Antibody-antigen complexes were collected using fixed S. aureus and analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Our previous results demonstrated that vaccinia virus mediated overexpression of M2 inhibited TGN to surface delivery of influenza HA (23Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, at these extremely high expression levels, M2 also inhibited earlier steps in transport through nonacidified compartments (23Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Sakaguchi T. Leser G.P. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 733-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Moreover, in our hands, synchronization of proteins along the secretory pathway by temperature blocks is not effective in vaccinia infected cells. To circumvent these problems we developed replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses expressing M2 (AV-M2) (24Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2477-2490Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In our system, expression of M2 is driven by the tetracycline operon and thus requires coinfection with an adenovirus encoding the tetracycline transactivator chimera (AV-TA; expression of the TA protein in this virus is constitutively driven by the constitutive CMV promoter). We infected HeLa cells using AV-M2 and AV-TA at various m.o.i. and examined the localization of the protein using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig.1). Cells infected at low m.o.i. (100) had very low levels of M2 staining. More staining was visible in cells infected with AV-M2 at m.o.i. 500. Interestingly, most of the staining was localized to the plasma membrane, and no distinct organelle staining was visible at either infection level. However, the nuclei of many of the cells infected at high m.o.i. had multiple donut-shaped inclusions that stained brightly for M2. The origin of these inclusions is not known. Other than this, we did not observe any effect of viral infection on the morphology of the cells during the course of our experiments. These expression patterns are very different from M2 overexpressed in HeLa cells using recombinant vaccinia, where the majority of the protein accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex and cells became rounded after several hours of expression (23Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test the effect of M2 on biosynthetic traffic, we infected HeLa cells at various m.o.i. with AV-TA and AV-M2 (or AV-M2rev, a control virus that encodes M2 in the reverse orientation) and measured the effects on HA delivery from the TGN to the plasma membrane. Cells were radiolabeled for 15 min, then chased for 2 h at 19 °C to accumulate newly synthesized proteins in the TGN. M2 had a moderate effect on the amount of HA that was endoglycosidase H-resistant after this chase period, consistent with slower intra-Golgi transport as has been reported previously (23Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Sakaguchi T. Leser G.P. Lamb R.A. J.

Nagao K. Yamasaki M. Takatsuki A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1993; 18: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Yilla M. Tan A. Ito K. Miwa K. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol.

We have demonstrated previously that the delay in these early transport steps in M2-expressing cells is most likely an indirect effect resulting from prolonged accumulation of proteins, lipids, and possibly transport machinery in the TGN (23Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As expected, M2 expression had a much more dramatic effect on the kinetics of HA delivery from the TGN to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, B andC). The effect of M2 on HA delivery was maximal at m.o.i. 100. Subsequent experiments showed similar inhibition at m.o.i. as low as 50 (data not shown). These results suggest that M2 is active in the TGN, and that TGN acidification is required for efficient delivery of HA to the cell surface in these cells. We then measured the effect of M2 expression on Tf recycling. In polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, where M2 expression is restricted to apical endosomal compartments, we observed no effect on Tf recycling (24Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2477-2490Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, we reasoned that M2 might affect Tf recycling if it localized to endosomal compartments in nonpolarized cells. Thus, we determined the effect of increasing M2 expression levels on Tf recycling (Fig.3). Cells infected with M2rev had identical Tf recycling kinetics compared with mock-infected cells (Fig.3 A). M2 expressed using low m.o.i. (100) had a slight but reproducible effect on Tf recycling (∼10% decrease in initial rate). By contrast, Tf recycling was markedly reduced (∼30%) in cells expressing higher levels of M2 (m.o.i. 500). Addition of doxycycline to block M2 expression after viral infection, or addition of AMT to the medium shortly before Tf uptake, resulted in normal Tf recycling kinetics, suggesting that the effect on recycling was due to M2-mediated ion channel activity. Fig. 3 B shows the results from several experiments in which the dose-dependence of M2's effect on Tf recycling was compared. The effect of M2 on Tf recycling was essentially maximal at m.o.i. 500, as increasing the dose to m.o.i. 2500 had no further effect on recycling. Interestingly, the effect of M2 on recycling never approached that of the V-ATPase inhibitor BafA1, which inhibited recycling by approximately 60%. Addition of AMT or the reversible M2 inhibitor BL-1743 completely blocked the effect of M2 at all m.o.i. tested. To test whether M2 expression affected lysosomal function, we measured its effect on degradation of radioiodinated EGF. Interestingly, no effect of M2 on EGF degradation was observed, whereas treatment with chloroquine drastically inhibited this process (Fig.4). To further confirm that M2 did not disrupt lysosomal pH, we compared the effects of M2 and chloroquine on lysosome morphology using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig.5). As expected, incubation with chloroquine caused dramatic swelling of lysosomal compartments as visualized using an antibody against the membrane protein LAMP-1. By contrast, M2 expression had no effect on LAMP-1 staining.Figure 5M2 does not affect the steady state distribution of lysosomal membrane proteins. HeLa cells were mock-infected (mock) or infected with AV-TA and AV-M2 at a m.o.i. of 500 (M2). After infection, one dish of mock-infected cells was treated with 50 μg/ml chloroquine (chlor), and an AV-M2-infected dish was incubated with AMT (M2+AMT). The following day, cells were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence to localize LAMP-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although there is considerable indirect evidence to suggest that M2 expression alters organelle pH, this has never been directly measured (26Takeuchi K.

Virology. 1992; 188: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We took advantage of a relatively new fluorescence pH indicator to test whether M2 affected the pH of intracellular organelles. We incubated mock-infected or AV-M2-infected HeLa cells (m.o.i. 500) with LysoSensor yellow/blue, a membrane permeant probe that fluoresces bright yellow at acidic pH and dim blue at neutral pH. Although the blue staining was relatively uninformative, we were able to monitor acidified compartments in each cell by visualizing the yellow fluorescence. Mock-infected cells had numerous acidic compartments, as evidenced by the multitude of bright yellow punctae (Fig. 6 A). As expected, treatment with chloroquine caused all of the punctae to disappear (Fig.6 B). Interestingly, when cells expressing M2 were incubated with LysoSensor, a much smaller number of yellow compartments were present (Fig. 6 C). Based on the trafficking assays described above, we hypothesize that these remaining punctae represent late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, as the function of these compartments is not compromised by M2 activity. We observed a similar staining pattern for all of the cells on the coverslip, suggesting that essentially all of the cells expressed M2. Within 15 min of addition of AMT to the M2-expressing cells, there was a dramatic increase in the number of acidic compartments, as evidenced by the appearance of numerous new yellow punctae (Fig. 6 D). Thus M2 expression alters the pH of a subset of acidified compartments in the cell, and the effects of M2 can be rapidly reversed. Because we were able to selectively alter TGN or TGN/endosome function by varying M2 expression levels, we tested the effect of M2 on delivery of the newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D. This protein is synthesized as a 53-kDa precursor (P) in the endoplasmic reticulum, clipped in the TGN and/or endosomes to an slightly smaller intermediate (I) form, then processed to a mature 30-kDa form (M) in lysosomes (31Gieselmann V. Pohlmann R. Hasilik A. von Figura K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Conversion to the mature form is not dependent on prior cleavage to the intermediate form (32Richo G.R. Conner G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14806-14812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pertubation of acidified compartments using various inhibitors blocks cathepsin D processing to the mature form and in some cases increases secretion of the precursor (33Oda K. Nishimura Y. Ikehara Y. Kato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Imort M. Zuhlsdorf M. Feige U. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Biochem.

However, because cathepsin D processing to its mature form requires acidic pH, it can be difficult to distinguish missorting of intracellular cathepsin D from the accumulation of precursor or intermediate forms in lysosomes. Therefore, we compared the effects of M2 and BafA1 on processing and delivery of newly synthesized cathepsin D in HeLa cells (Fig.7). As predicted, BafA1blocked proteolytic maturation of cathepsin D and slightly increased secretion of the precursor. Low expression levels of M2 (m.o.i. 100) slightly delayed processing of cathepsin D to both the intermediate and mature forms. Higher expression of M2 (m.o.i. 500) had a more dramatic effect on both steps that was almost completely reversed when AMT was included. These data suggest that at least some cleavage of cathepsin D to its intermediate form normally occurs in the TGN. Furthermore, because higher expression levels of M2 had a greater effect on cathepsin D maturation, a portion of cathepsin D may traffic through early endosomes in HeLa cells. We have developed a new method to selectively elevate the pH of some intracellular acidified compartments. By varying the expression level of virally expressed influenza M2 protein, an acid-activated ion channel, we can reversibly modulate TGN or TGN/endosome pH in HeLa cells without affecting lysosomal pH or function. At low expression levels, maximal effects on TGN-to-cell surface delivery of the marker protein influenza HA were observed. However, higher expression levels were required to maximally inhibit the recycling of transferrin. Even at these high expression levels, no effects on lysosomal function were observed. Fluorescence staining of live cells using a pH-sensitive dye confirmed the selective effect of M2 on a subset of acidified compartments. To our knowledge, this is the first directdemonstration that influenza M2 perturbs organelle pH in mammalian cells. Although even low expression levels of M2 dramatically inhibited TGN-to-cell surface delivery of the marker protein influenza HA, M2 did not completely block exit from the TGN, as secretion of newly synthesized cathepsin D continued normally in M2-expressing cells. Moreover, we have found that cell surface delivery of another heterologous membrane protein, the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, was completely unaffected by even high levels of M2 expression. 3G. A. Gibson and O. A. Weisz, unpublished observations. The selective effect of M2 on HA but not polymeric immunoglobulin receptor delivery was also observed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. 4J. R. Henkel, G. A. Gibson, and O. A. Weisz, unpublished observations. Differences in the marker proteins as well as cell lines used could thus account for some of the discrepancies between the various studies on the role of acidification on secretory traffic. Interestingly, the maximal effect of M2 on Tf recycling never approached that of the V-ATPase inhibitor BafA1. Because essentially all cells are infected under our conditions, this difference does not reflect activity of M2 in only a subset of cells. Although it is possible that BafA1 has a greater effect on endosomal pH than M2, increasing M2 m.o.i. 5-fold had no further effect on Tf recycling. Rather, our results suggest that M2 is present or active in only a subset of endocytic compartments through which receptor-bound Tf passes. Iron is thought to dissociate from Tf primarily in sorting endosomes; subsequently, receptor-bound Tf is segregated into recycling endosomes and returned to the cell surface. In the presence of BafA1, iron remains bound to transferrin throughout the pathway and prevents recycled Tf from dissociating from its receptor upon return to the cell surface (15van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In cells expressing M2, the pH of a subset of acidified compartments along the transferrin recycling route could be altered, resulting in partial dissociation of iron from transferrin during recycling. Alternatively, iron dissociation could proceed normally in M2-expressing cells and the effects we observed might reflect effects on the rate of receptor movement along the recycling pathway. Presley et al. (39Presley J.F. Mayor S. McGraw T.E. Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13929-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) found that BafA1 treatment caused a ∼45% decrease in the rate of transferrin receptor recycling; this is comparable with the ∼35% effect on transferrin release we observed at high levels of M2 expression. Importantly, even at high expression levels, M2 had no effect on the kinetics of degradation of internalized EGF, suggesting that both delivery to lysosomes and lysosomal function were unaffected. By contrast, BafA1 treatment has been variously reported to block delivery from late endosomes to lysosomes (15van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and lysosomal degradation but not delivery to lysosomes (7Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17707-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, lysosome morphology and the steady state distribution of lysosomal enzymes were unaffected in M2-expressing cells. This is in sharp contrast to all other pH perturbants, which have dramatic effects on lysosome pH and function. The ability to alter the pH of a subset of intracellular compartments using M2 should thus help us to dissect the role of acidification in individual steps along pathways that involve transport through multiple acidified compartments. To test the utility of our system, we examined the effect of M2 on delivery of newly synthesized cathepsin D to lysosomes. Because many steps in the sorting of lysosomal hydrolases are pH-sensitive, the role of acidification in individual compartments remains relatively poorly understood despite considerable study. Cathepsin D delivery to lysosomes first involves binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) in the TGN. This step is complicated by the differential pH binding profiles of the two MPRs: the cation-dependent MPR binds many substrates weakly at neutral pH, while the cation-independent MPR is pH-insensitive within a relatively broad range (40Hoflack B. Fujimoto K. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the two MPRs have overlapping substrate specificities, they cannot completely substitute for each other when one is nonfunctional (41Pohlmann R. Wendland M. Boeker C. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 42Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The MPR-hydrolase complexes are transported to late endosomes where pH-dependent dissociation of the hydrolases occurs. While a direct route from the TGN to late endosomes has been proposed, in some cell types cathepsin D may transit through early endosomes en route to lysosomes (43Ludwig T. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 44Rijnboutt S. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15665-15672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this pathway, a significant fraction of cathepsin D delivery in some cells also occurs via MPR-independent mechanisms (45Diment S. Leech M.S. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46von Figura K. Hasilik A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). BafA1 treatment likely inhibits the pH-dependent steps; however, since cathepsin D maturation in lysosomes is also inhibited, it is difficult to determine the effect of BafA1 on individual steps in transport or on MPR-independent delivery. Furthermore, neutralized lysosomes might not be recognized as an appropriate target for fusion by compartments carrying newly synthesized cargo; for example, inactivation of lysosomes using HRP blocks the lysosomal delivery of internalized EGF-EGF receptor complexes (47Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Processing of newly synthesized cathepsin D to its mature form (a lysosomal event) was progressively inhibited by increased expression of M2 and completely inhibited (as expected) by BafA1. The progressive effect of increasing M2 expression on cathepsin D processing and delivery supports the idea that some cathepsin D traffics through early endosomes in these cells. In neither case was cathepsin D delivery to lysosomes completely inhibited. The properly targeted fraction could represent cathepsin D transport via the pH-independent pathway or cathepsin D binding to the cation-independent MPR, which may still occur at neutral pH. Importantly, our data also demonstrate that inefficient delivery of newly synthesized hydrolases in pH-perturbed cells is not simply due to the loss of recognition of the lysosome as an appropriate target. In summary, influenza M2 expression provides a novel method to selectively alter the pH of a subset of acidified organelles. Further characterization of the effects of M2 on pH in individual compartments should help us dissect the role of acidification in numerous processing and transport steps along the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways. In addition, the possibility of altering M2 localization or proton channel activity via site-directed mutagenesis may add a new level of flexibility in manipulating organelle pH.

Overexpressed type II receptors can bind ligand in the absence of type I receptor with moderate affinity, while it is generally accepted that type I receptors require type II receptors to bind ligand in the high affinity receptor complex.

Like other members of the TGF-β family, the activins are synthesized as large precursor proteins consisting of a signal peptide, a glycosylated prodomain and a mature domain. The maturation of activin requires intracellular cleavage by protein convertases, such as furin, at the basic cleavage site which separates the mature chain from the prodomain (13Huylebroeck D. Van Nimmen K. Waheed A. von Figura K. Marmenout A. Fransen L. De Waele P. Jaspar J.-M. Franchimont P. Stunnenberg H. Van Heuverswijn H. Mol.

Thus far, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, and BMP-7 (also called osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1)) have been crystallized, and the three-dimensional structures of the mature, dimeric molecules have been elucidated (17Daopin S.

These proteins share a common three-dimensional polypeptide folding pattern, although their amino acid sequence identity is limited to 36% (BMP-7 compared with TGF-β2). Hence, it is likely that this structure is the prototype for the whole family and might be extrapolated to activins as well. The common fold of the monomer is defined by seven cysteines that are conserved throughout the family. Six of these form intrachain disulfide bonds and make up the cystine knot, while the seventh cysteine forms an interchain disulfide bond that stabilizes the dimer (17Daopin S. Piez K. Ogawa Y.

By analogy with a left hand, the monomeric structure consists of the N-terminal thumb region, two antiparallel pairs of β-strands that build up four fingers, two loops that connect the fingers (loop 1 connects finger 1 and 2; loop 2 connects finger 3 and 4), and a long α-helix at the heel of the hand (see Fig. 1). This prototype structure defines four solvent-accessible, flexible and divergent regions, which may contain putative receptor-binding sites, i.e. the N terminus, loop 1, loop 2, and the C-terminal end of the long α-helix (17Daopin S.

Amino acids important for biological activity have been defined by limited structure-function analysis of TGF-β members and by molecular characterization of naturally occurring mutations that cause drastic phenotypes in different organisms. Mutation analysis revealed that the nine cysteines, including the seven conserved cysteines in the family, of mature activin A are essential for either the biosynthesis or the (full) biological activity of activin A (20Mason A.J.

In mature TGF-β1, the C-terminal portion (amino acids 83–112) has recently been defined as necessary for high affinity binding to the TGF-β receptor type II (TβRII) (21Qian S.W. Burmester J.K. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Hinck A.P. Ohlsen D.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30656-30662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, frameshift and/or point mutations (i.e.replacement of the first conserved cysteine by tyrosine) in hCDMP-1 (human cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein), and growth and differentiation factor (GDF)-8, have been identified in human chondrodysplasia and double muscling in cattle, respectively (22Thomas J.T.

A. 1997; 94: 12457-12461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). However, no specific receptor binding determinants are known for any TGF-β member. Detailed mutagenesis studies of TGF-β family members would provide insight into how such mutations affect their biological activities, and this may facilitate the development of therapeutic agents that can be used in TGF-β-related diseases. In order to identify amino acids important for receptor binding and biological activity, we started structure-function analysis of activin A by introducing single amino acid substitutions in the mature domain, in regions that are thought to be involved in receptor interaction (18Schlunegger M. Grütter M. Nature. 1992; 358: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In this way, we identified two amino acids in activin A which are important for its biological activity and its interaction with the type II receptor: Asp-27 and Lys-102, located in loop 1 and 2, respectively. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using plasmid PTZ18R, which contains a mouse activin A cDNA cloned in the sense orientation with respect to the T7 promoter, and the Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). Mutations were introduced using the single-stranded sense oligonucleotides listed in TableI.Table IMutant activins and oligonucleotides used for mutagenesisE3A:5′-GTAGGCGGGGCTTGGAGTGCGACGGCAAGG-3′D5A:5′-GGCTTGGAGTGCGCCGGCAAGG-3′K7A:5′-GGAGTGCGACGGCGCCGTCAACATTTGCTG-3′K13A5′-CAACATTTGCTGTGCCAAACAGTTCTTTGTC-3′K13T:5′-CAACATTTGCTGTACCAAACAGTTCTTTGTC-3′K14A:5′-CAACATTTGCTGTAAGGCACAGTTCTTTGTC-3′K14E:5′-CAACATTTGCTGTAAGGAACAGTTCTTTGTC-3′K21A:5′-CTTTGTCAGCTTCGCGGACATTGGC-3′K21T:5′-CTTTGTCAGCTTCACGGACATTGGC-3′K21E:5′-CTTTGTCAGCTTCGAGGACATTGGC-3′D22A:5′-CAGTTCTTTGTCAGCTTTAAAGCCATTGGCTGG-3′D27A:5′-GGCTGGAATGCCTGGATCATTGCTCCC-3′D27K:5′-GCTTCAAGGATATCGGCTGGAATAAATGGATCATTGC-3′V18I/S19D:5′-GAAACAGTTCTTTATCGATTTCAAGGACATTGGCTGG-3′H47A:5′-GAGTGCCCAAGCGCCATAGCAGGTACCTCTGGGTC-3′H71A:5′-CACTACCGCATGCGGGGTGCCAGCCCCTTTGC-3′H71N:5′-CACTACCGCATGCGGGGTAACAGCCCCTTTGC-3′H71K:5′-CACTACCGCATGCGGGGTAAGAGCCCCTTTGC-3′H71-:5′-CACTACCGCATGCGGGGTAGCCCCTTTGCCAACCTT-3′H71-/S72-:5′-CACTACCGCATGCGGGGTCCCTTTGCCAACCTTAAG-3′K85A:5′-GCTGTGTGCCCACAGCGCTGAGACCCATG-3′R87A:5′-GTGCCCACCAAGCTTGCACCCATGTCCATG-3′D95A:5′-GCTGTATTACGCTGATGGCCAAAACATC-3′D96A:5′-GCTGTATTACGATGCCGGCCAAAACATC-3′K102A:5′-GTCAAAACATCATCGCAAAGGATATCCAAAACATG-3′K102E:5′-GTCAAAACATCATCGAAAAGGATATCCAAAACATG-3′K102R:5′-GTCAAAACATCATCAGAAAGGATATCCAAAACATG-3′K103A:5′-CATCATCAAAGCGGATATCCAAAACATGATTGTGG-3′Q106A:5′-CATCAAAAAGGATATCGCAAACATGATTGTG-3′E111A:5′-CATGATTGTGGCGGAGTGTGGCTGCAGCTAGAGTCGCC-3′E112A:5′-CATGATTGTGGAGGCATGCGGCTGCTCCTAG-3′G114K:5′-CATGATTGTGGAGGAGTGTAAGTGCTCCTGAATTCGCCAGGTCCC-3′ Open table in a new tab Mutant TGF-β2L1 was constructed using two complementary oligonucleotides representing the DNA sequence of loop 1 of TGF-β2: 5′-CGATTTCAAGAGAGATCTAGGGTGGAAATGGATACACGAACCCT-3′ and 5′-CCGGAGGGTTCGTGTATCCATTTCCACCCTAGATCTCTCTTGAAAT-3′ This sequence was cloned into an activin mutant construct in which aClaI site and a MroI site had been introduced upstream and downstream, respectively, of the loop 1 (Val-18 to Pro-32) sequence. Mutant activin V18I/S19D/N26I/D27G was generated by partial double annealing via the nine 3′-nucleotides of 5′-GAAACAGTTCTTTATCGATTTCAAGGACATTGGCTGGATTGGCTGG-3′. This generated two extra mutations (N26I and D27G) in addition to those generated by oligonucleotide V18I/S19D. All mutations, listed in Fig. 1 B, were confirmed by DNA sequencing. This expression system has been described previously (13Huylebroeck D. Van Nimmen K. Waheed A. von Figura K. Marmenout A. Fransen L. De Waele P. Jaspar J.-M. Franchimont P. Stunnenberg H. Van Heuverswijn H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but it was applied in a slightly modified manner. Subconfluent HeLa or PK15 cells (10-cm2dishes) were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing phage T7 RNA polymerase (multiplicity of infection: 5) for 1 h at 24 °C. These cells were then transfected with T7 promoter-containing plasmids encoding the wild type and mutant activins A, using DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim). For the heterodimerization assay, cells were cotransfected with T7 plasmids encoding zebrafish activin B (a gift from F. Rosa, U368 INSERM, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France). Cells were incubated with this DNA/DOTAP mix for 6 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were then washed with methionine-free minimum essential medium before starvation in this medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were next pulse-labeled for 1 h by addition of 1 ml of the same medium containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (ICN). The cells were chased by addition of 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and a 10-fold higher concentration of cold methionine than is normally present in this medium. After 14 h at 37 °C, the medium was collected and centrifuged, and the supernatant was frozen. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis after precipitation of the proteins with trichloroacetic acid, as described previously (13Huylebroeck D. Van Nimmen K. Waheed A. von Figura K. Marmenout A. Fransen L. De Waele P. Jaspar J.-M. Franchimont P. Stunnenberg H. Van Heuverswijn H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) assay was performed as described (25Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Huylebroeck D. Sampath T.K. Andries M. Smith J.C. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary rat pituitary cells were cultured for 2 days in serum-free medium (as specified in Ref. 25Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Huylebroeck D. Sampath T.K. Andries M. Smith J.C. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) containing dilutions of the activin A mutant proteins. The medium was then collected, and the FSH concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Each mutant activin was added to three wells, and the RIA for FSH was performed in duplicate using the FSH-RIA kit (NIDDKD, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD) according to Denef et al. (26Denef C. Maertens P. Allaerts W. Mignon A. Robberecht W. Swennen L. Carmeliet P. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 168: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Xenopusembryos were obtained by in vitro fertilization (27Smith J.C. Slack J.M.W. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1983; 78: 299-317PubMed Google Scholar). They were maintained in 10% Normal Amphibian Medium (28Slack J.M.W. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1984; 80: 289-319PubMed Google Scholar) and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (29Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. Daudlin, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). Animal pole regions were dissected from mid-blastula (stage 8) embryos (30Smith J.C. Hartley D. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 181-204Google Scholar) and cultured in 75% Normal Amphibian Medium containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and wild type or mutant activin (2.5 ng/ml). A preliminary assessment of mesoderm induction was based on the elongation of the animal caps. Animal pole regions were then frozen on dry ice, and expression of the mesoderm-specific gene Brachyury (Xbra) (31Smith J.C. Price B.M.J. Green J.B.A. Weigel D. Herrmann B.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) was assayed by RNase protection analysis as described by Jones et al. (32Jones C.M. Kuehn M.R. Hogan B.L.M. Smith J.C. Wright C.V.E. Development. 1995; 121: 3651-3662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant activins, and follistatin were iodinated using a modified chloramine-T method (33De Winter J.P. ten Dijke P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Verschueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Two μg of protein (in 10 μl of 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) were diluted with 10 μl of 600 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 5 μl of Na125I (0.25 mCi; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4 and 1.5 mm KH2PO4). To initiate the radioiodination, 10 μl of chloramine-T (100 μg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5); Sigma) was added. After 2 min, the iodination was stopped by addition of 20 μl of 50 mm N-acetyl-l-tyrosine (Sigma), 200 μl of 60 mm sodium iodide, and 200 μl of 10m ultrapure urea (Life Technologies). Subsequently, the reaction mixture was passed over a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was equilibrated and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) hemoglobin (Sigma). Peak fractions, with specific activities of 30–100 μCi/μg of protein, were routinely obtained, pooled, and stored at −80 °C. Radioiodinated follistatin288 (FS288) was cross-linked to cold wild type and mutant activins using bis-sulfo-succinimidyl suberate (BS3; Pierce) (33De Winter J.P. ten Dijke P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Verschueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 ng of iodinated FS288 (5 μl) was incubated with 500 μl of activin-containing conditioned medium prepared as described above. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C on a rotary shaker, 125 μl of 5 mm BS3 in HEPES-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl and 20 mmHEPES; Life Technologies, Inc.) was added and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Activin/follistatin complexes were purified using wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (Sigma) beads (33De Winter J.P. ten Dijke P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Verschueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). They were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and visualized by autoradiography. PK15 cells (28-cm2dishes) were transfected with different combinations of activin receptors using the vaccinia virus-T7 system as described above. On the second day, the cells were washed with ice-cold binding medium (HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (pH 7.5) containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for 10 min. Cells were incubated with 150 pm labeled activin A in 1.5 ml of binding medium for 2 h at 4 °C. For competition studies, cells were incubated with a constant amount (150 pm) of125I-labeled wild type activin and (simultaneously added) different amounts of cold wild type or mutant activins. Then, iodinated activin was removed by gently and repeatedly washing the cells with ice-cold HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.9 mmCaCl2. Activin was cross-linked by incubation in 1.5 ml of HEPES-buffered saline containing 1 mm BS3 for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was then quenched for 5 min at 4 °C by addition of 150 μl of 10× quench solution (10×: 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, and 200 mm glycine). The cells were scraped from the plates in 1 ml of detachment buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mmEDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 μg of aprotinin/ml, 0.5 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and collected by centrifugation (5 min at 4 °C). The pellet was then dissolved in 50 μl of solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 125 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 μg of aprotinin/ml, 0.5 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by incubation for 40 min on ice. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The large scale production of wild type and mutant activins was performed using a baculovirus expression system. The mutant cDNA was inserted in the baculotransfer vector pVL1393 under transcriptional control of the baculoviral polyhedrin promotor. Recombinant baculovirus was generated by homologous recombination in Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) cotransfected with the recombinant transfer construct and BaculogoldTM virus AcNPV DNA (PharMingen). Recombinant virus was plaque-purified and amplified to high titer stock for production. Activin was purified from conditioned medium of recombinant baculovirus infected Sf9 cells, harvested 72 h after infection. Purification of wild type and mutant activins was performed by use of an optimized four-step purification protocol in which the conditioned medium is diafiltrated and concentrated in the presence of 6m urea and loaded onto an anion exchange column (Fractogel-(EMD)-TMAE, Merck). The flow-through is then loaded on a Protein Pack Sulfonyl (Millipore) cation exchange column. The 150 mm NaCl fraction is then adjusted to 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and separated by RPC-4 (Fractogel-butyl) reversed phase chromatography. Mutant activins are recovered in the 30–34% acetonitrile fraction (34Smith J.C. Price B.M.J. Van Nimmen K. Huylebroeck D. Nature. 1990; 345: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and further purified on a RPC-8 (Brownlee octyl) column run as a polishing step. Quantification of these pure activins was obtained through amino acid composition analysis. Some mutations in structurally important regions of TGF-β family members have been reported to lead to improper biosynthesis of these ligands (15Mason A.J. Farnworth P.G. Sullivan J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Wittbrodt J. Rosa F.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1448-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Mason A.J. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In our study, this was also the case when severe changes in activin A were introduced. For example, the substitution of loop 1 of activin A by the equivalent region of TGF-β2 led to undetectable protein expression levels in the vaccinia virus-T7 system, both in the secreted and in the intracellular fraction (data not shown). It is likely that intracellular degradation occurred, as has been suggested for most cysteine mutants of activin A and TGF-β1 (20Mason A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 325-332PubMed Google Scholar, 36Brunner A.M. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Wang W.-C. Shapiro R.A. Neubauer M. Cook J. Madisen Purchio A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To avoid synthesis and intracellular trafficking problems due to structural changes, we anticipated that the majority of mutant activins used in this study should be generated by single amino acid substitution. Four solvent-accessible regions can be deduced from the three-dimensional structure of TGF-β2 and BMP-7 (17Daopin S. Piez K. Ogawa Y. Davies D. Science. 1992; 257: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 18Schlunegger M. Grütter M. Nature. 1992; 358: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 19Griffith D.L. Keck P.C. Sampath T.K. Rueger D.C. Carlson W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These regions are the most flexible structures in the dimer, and their sequences are divergent throughout the family, which marks them as good candidates for receptor interaction. Most of the mutations introduced are single alanine substitutions at charged residues in these domains (Fig. 1 A). A large panel of 39 activin A mutants was constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Fig.1 B). Synthesis of this large panel of activin polypeptides was first analyzed in HeLa cells using the T7 vaccinia virus-based expression system. As suggested previously, these cells have sufficient levels of endogenous furin to support correct and efficient processing of the activin A precursor (13Huylebroeck D. Van Nimmen K. Waheed A. von Figura K. Marmenout A. Fransen L. De Waele P. Jaspar J.-M. Franchimont P. Stunnenberg H. Van Heuverswijn H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Synthesized proteins were visualized by metabolic labeling followed by SDS-PAGE. We assessed both the maturation of activin A mutants to a 25-kDa dimer as well as their capacity to heterodimerize with zebrafish activin B; a secreted activin AB heterodimer can be resolved in SDS-PAGE because activin A homodimers have a slower migration than activin B homodimers. Nearly all activin A mutant polypeptides were processed like the wild type precursor and they heterodimerized efficiently (and predominantly) with activin B, as observed previously (Ref. 37Ling N. Ying S.-Y. Ueno N. Shimasaki S. Esch F. Hotta M. Guillemin R. Nature. 1986; 321: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar and data not shown; only activin dimers of D27K, K102A, K102E and K102R, respectively, are shown in Fig.2). This indicates that the overall structure of the precursor polypeptides and their intracellular folding and dimerization in the rough endoplasmic reticulum are not altered. As well as analyzing their ability to dimerize, the ability of the mutants to bind follistatin (FS), an antagonistic binding protein of activin, was tested by cross-linking. All mutant activins tested (including K102A and K102E), formed complexes with FS288 like wild type activin (shown for K102A and K102E in Fig. 3). This again suggests that their overall structure is not dramatically altered, if at all.Figure 3Binding of mutant activins to follistatin. Approximately 2 ng of iodinated FS288 (in 5 μl of phosphate-buffered saline) was incubated with 500 μl of vaccinia virus-T7 produced proteins. After cross-linking of the activin/follistatin complexes, they were purified using wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose (33De Winter J.P. ten Dijke P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E.

https://openalex.org/W2037953456,"Increased microtubule density, through viscous loading of active myofilaments, causes contractile dysfunction of hypertrophied and failing pressure-overloaded myocardium, which is normalized by microtubule depolymerization. We have found this to be based on augmented tubulin synthesis and microtubule stability. We show here that increased tubulin synthesis is accounted for by marked transcriptional up-regulation of the β1- and β2-tubulin isoforms, that hypertrophic regulation of these genes recapitulates their developmental regulation, and that the greater proportion of β1-tubulin protein may have a causative role in the microtubule stabilization found in cardiac hypertrophy."

Still other degradation signals have been demonstrated to exist, and in some cases their locations have been at least partially mapped (19Treier M. Staszewski L. Bohmann D.

Given the small number of destruction signal elements whose locations have been precisely determined, it is difficult to conclude whether it is only the primary structures of these signals that are important for their recognition or whether defined, higher order structural features come into play. The destruction signal of the MATα2 repressor, for example, has been hypothesized to contain an amphipathic α-helix (24Johnson P.R. Swanson R. Rakhillna L. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1998; 94: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Very few of the protein destruction signals that have been mapped so far have been shown to be recognized by a particular Ub system factor or factors. It is likely that the recognition of substrate proteins occurs primarily through the binding of a Ub-protein ligase, or E3, to the destruction signal elements (2Scheffner M. Smith S. Jentsch S. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 65-98Crossref Google Scholar). Several E3 proteins or protein complexes have been identified to date. As characterized by function, these can be divided into two classes (26Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12148-12154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Some, such as SCF complexes composed of SKP1, CDC53, and an F-box protein (27Bai C. Hofmann K. Goeble M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), appear to operate as docking proteins by binding to both the substrate to be ubiquitinated and an E2 Ub-conjugating protein, the latter of which transfers the Ub molecule to the target. Other E3 proteins actually catalyze the attachment of Ub to the target, with a ubiquitinated E2 serving as a Ub donor. These include the mammalian E3α and its yeast homologue Ubr1 (28Hershko A.

A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). E3α and Ubr1 are known to ubiquitinate N-end rule substrates (29Reiss Y. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10378-10383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Bartel B. Wünning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and Ubr1 has recently been found to participate in the ubiquitination of the yeast proteins Gα and Cup9 (18Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Byrd C. Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), neither of which contains a destabilizing N-terminal amino acid. In the case of Gα, the Ubr1 recognition element has been mapped to a 60-amino acid region near the N terminus (25Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Madura K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the recognition of Cup9 requires the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein (23Byrd C. Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The only other definitively known connection between a protein destruction signal and a Ub-protein ligase is that between the cyclin destruction signal sequence and the cyclosome complex (33King R.W.

We have recently identified the 3C proteases of two picornaviruses as substrates for Ub-mediated degradation (35Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A. Wey A.C. DiGeorge A.M. Lockhart J.L. Wilson J.W. Wintrode P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28429-28435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gladding R.L. Haas A.L. Gronros D.L. Lawson T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 3C proteases are cysteine proteases of approximately 21–24 kDa which exhibit a high degree of substrate specificity (37Kräusslich H.-G. Nicklin M.J.H. Lee C.-K. Wimmer E. Biochemie (Paris). 1988; 70: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These proteins are initially synthesized within large polyproteins encoded by the positive stranded RNA viral genomes. They are responsible for most of the proteolytic processing of the polyproteins, which leads to the generation of individual functional proteins, including free, mature 3C proteases (37Kräusslich H.-G. Nicklin M.J.H. Lee C.-K. Wimmer E. Biochemie (Paris). 1988; 70: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Palmenberg A.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The mature 3C protease of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) has been shown to be rapidly degraded in vivo andin vitro (39Lawson T.G. Smith L.L. Palmenberg A.C. Thach R.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5013-5022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Oberst M.D. Gollan T.J. Gupta M. Peura S.R. Zydlewski J.D. Sudarsanan P. Lawson T.G. Virology. 1993; 193: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence indicates that the mature 3C protease of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) is short livedin vivo (41Gauss-Müller V. Jurgensen D. Deutzmann R. Virology. 1991; 182: 861-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and it has been directly proven to be quickly degraded in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (36Gladding R.L. Haas A.L. Gronros D.L. Lawson T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The destruction of both of these proteins requires both the synthesis of Ub-3C protease conjugates and the action of the proteasome (35Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A. Wey A.C. DiGeorge A.M. Lockhart J.L. Wilson J.W. Wintrode P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28429-28435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gladding R.L. Haas A.L. Gronros D.L. Lawson T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Neither of these 3C proteases possesses a destabilizing N-terminal amino acid or homology with any reported sequences suspected of being required for recognition by the Ub-mediated proteolytic system. In order to understand how the short lived 3C proteases are selected for rapid destruction and to facilitate studies of what role this destruction might play in the viral infectious cycles, we have attempted to identify structural features of the EMCV 3C protease that are required for recognition by the Ub-mediated proteolytic system. Because we have recently demonstrated that at least one Ub-conjugating system component in rabbit reticulocyte lysate recognizes both the EMCV and the HAV 3C proteases (36Gladding R.L. Haas A.L. Gronros D.L. Lawson T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and because of the difficulties associated with detecting unstable 3C proteases in vivo, we have employed the reticulocyte lysate system in our search. Here we report the identification and characterization of a 10-amino acid destruction signal sequence in the EMCV 3C protease. An analogous sequence is demonstrated to exist in the HAV 3C protease as well. In addition, we have identified two E3 Ub-protein ligases, one being E3α, that recognize the EMCV 3C protease and consequently catalyze the conjugation of Ub to the protein. pE3C (36Gladding R.L. Haas A.L. Gronros D.L. Lawson T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or pE3B′CD′* (35Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A. Wey A.C. DiGeorge A.M. Lockhart J.L. Wilson J.W. Wintrode P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28429-28435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were employed in the construction of allin vitro transcription plasmids containing mutated EMCV 3C protease coding sequences. pETP3C (36Gladding R.L. Haas A.L. Gronros D.L. Lawson T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or pT7-1 (42Ypma-Wong M.F. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3181-3189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used as the starting points for the construction of all plasmids containing mutated poliovirus 3C protease coding sequences. pE5P-P3 (43Teser M. Pak I. Jia X.-Y. Richards O.C. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld O.C. Virology. 1994; 198: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was used as the source of sequences to construct transcription vectors encoding mutated HAV 3C protease coding sequences. All insert DNA fragments were prepared by PCR using PfuI DNA polymerase (Stratagene). All synthetic primers were obtained from Biosynthesis. Site-specific mutagenesis was accomplished using both coding and non-coding strand mutagenic primers. The large number of synthetic primers utilized in this study precludes listing the sequences here, and these may be obtained from the authors upon request. The 3C protease coding regions of all DNA constructs were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer. The inserts for pENPC and pPNEC, plasmids carrying the coding sequences for fused N- and C-terminal halves of the EMCV 3C and poliovirus 3C proteases, were prepared by two rounds of PCR. In the first round, the N- and C-terminal coding halves of each sequence were amplified from pE3C and pETP3C using primers containing the common 5′ … TTCAGAGAC … 3′ (FRD encoding) region and flanking primers containing the appropriate restriction endonuclease sites. In the second round, the sequences were fused in frame via the common aforementioned sequence, using the appropriate flanking primers. TheNcoI- and EcoRI-treated insert for pENPC was inserted into modified pGEM-3Z (35Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A. Wey A.C. DiGeorge A.M. Lockhart J.L. Wilson J.W. Wintrode P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28429-28435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the NcoI- andBamHI-treated insert for pPNEC was inserted into pET3d (44Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6004) Google Scholar). Inserts for pE3C(N), pE3C(C), pE3C-5, pE3C-15, pE3C-26, and pE3C-46 were prepared by amplifying the sequence to be retained withNcoI-containing coding strand deletion primers andEcoRI-containing non-coding strand flanking primers. Restriction endonuclease-treated inserts were ligated into modified pGEM-3Z. For constructs carrying codon mutations in the suspected EMCV 3C protease destruction signal sequence region or for constructs carrying EMCV 3C protease coding sequences with one or two lysine to arginine codon changes, the appropriate mutagenic primers and flanking primers containing NcoI and EcoRI sites were employed to amplify sequences from pE3C or pE3B′CD′*. Plasmids containing additional lysine to arginine codon changes in the EMCV 3C coding sequence (pE3CK(1–5)R, pE3CK(8–12)R, pE3CK(6–12)R, and pE3CK(1–12)R) were prepared from multiple rounds of PCR with mutagenic and flanking primers. The restriction endonuclease-treated inserts were ligated into modified pGEM-3Z. The insert for pETP3C-DS, which carries the sequence coding for the poliovirus 3C-DS protein, was prepared by two rounds of PCR amplification of the poliovirus 3C encoding DNA carried in pT7-1. Mutagenic primers and flanking primers containing NcoI orBamHI sites were employed. The NcoI- andBamHI-treated fragment was ligated into pET3d. pP3C-NDS, which carries the poliovirus 3C protease wild type coding sequence fused with a sequence encoding the N-terminal addition MGLLVRGRTLVV, was prepared as follows. A 75-base coding strand primer containing anNcoI site, the sequence coding for MGLLVRGRTLVV, and a sequence that overlaps the N-terminal encoding wild type sequence was used in combination with a non-coding strand flanking primer containing an EcoRI site to amplify the poliovirus 3C encoding sequence from pT7-1. Following treatment with NcoI andEcoRI, the resulting DNA fragment was ligated into modified pGEM-3Z. A modified version of this plasmid, pP3C-NDSI, was generated by using the mutagenic primers and PCR to synthesize a DNA insert in which the codons for the LVV sequence in the N-terminal extension were changed to codons for AAA. This insert was also ligated into modified pGEM-3Z. For the construction of pP3CA35L and pP3CA35L,I36L, the appropriate mutagenic primers and flanking primers containing NcoI or EcoRI sites were employed to amplify sequences from pETP3C. The restriction endonuclease-treated inserts were ligated into modified pGEM-3Z. For the construction of pHAV3CL32A,V34A and pHAV3CLLV(39–41)AAA, which carry the HAV 3C protease coding sequence with two or three codon mutations, respectively, the appropriate mutagenic primers and flanking primers containingNcoI or EcoRI sites were employed to amplify sequences from pE5P-P3. The restriction endonuclease-treated inserts were ligated into modified pGEM-3Z. The preparation of Escherichia coli cells that express the wild type EMCV 3C protease has already been described (35Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A. Wey A.C. DiGeorge A.M. Lockhart J.L. Wilson J.W. Wintrode P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28429-28435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutated 3C coding sequence carried in pE3CLVV(41–43)AAA (see “Results”) was amplified by PCR using primers containing NcoI or BamHI. The restriction endonuclease-treated fragment was ligated into pET-3d. This construct was used to transform E. coli BL21 (pLysS) cells. Expression, refolding, and purification of the protein were carried out as described previously (35Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A. Wey A.C. DiGeorge A.M. Lockhart J.L. Wilson J.W. Wintrode P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28429-28435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro transcriptions and translations in reticulocyte lysate were carried out as described previously (40Oberst M.D. Gollan T.J. Gupta M. Peura S.R. Zydlewski J.D. Sudarsanan P. Lawson T.G. Virology. 1993; 193: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The ability of the35S-labeled 3C protease proteins to be conjugated with MeUb (35Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A. Wey A.C.

Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) was tested in reaction mixtures containing 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mmKC2H3O2, 1 mmMg(C2H3O2)2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm MeUb, and 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide in 50% (v/v) nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate containing an ATP-regenerating system (35Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A. Wey A.C. DiGeorge A.M. Lockhart J.L. Wilson J.W. Wintrode P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28429-28435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C, and 1.5-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated times and analyzed by 12 or 16% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (40Oberst M.D. Gollan T.J. Gupta M. Peura S.R. Zydlewski J.D. Sudarsanan P. Lawson T.G. Virology. 1993; 193: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The degradation of the 35S-labeled proteins in the reticulocyte lysate system was monitored in reaction mixtures similar to that described above, except MeUb was replaced with 0.1 mm bovine Ub (Sigma). In some reactions 0.1 μm Ub aldehyde (46Mayer A.N. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), kindly provided by K. Wilkinson, was used in place of Ub. When lactacystin (Boston Biomedica) was included, it was added to give a final concentration of 100 nm. These reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C, and 1.5-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated times and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In some cases the amount of radioactivity present in the 35S-labeled 3C protease proteins was measured by liquid scintillation counting (40Oberst M.D. Gollan T.J. Gupta M. Peura S.R. Zydlewski J.D. Sudarsanan P. Lawson T.G. Virology. 1993; 193: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The activity of the in vitrosynthesized EMCV 3C protease proteins was tested using35S-labeled EMCV LVP0 polyprotein as a substrate as described previously (40Oberst M.D. Gollan T.J. Gupta M. Peura S.R. Zydlewski J.D. Sudarsanan P. Lawson T.G. Virology. 1993; 193: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Partially purified rabbit Ubc5 and purified rabbit E2–14K and E1 were kindly donated by C. Pickart. Human E3α, purified by affinity chromatography using an E2–14K column, was the generous gift of A. Haas. UbcH5 was purified from expressing E. coli cells kindly provided by P. Howley (see Ref. 47Scheffner M. Huibregste J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The UbcH5 purification procedure was adapted from procedures developed by L. Mastrandrea and C. Pickart. 2L. Mastrandrea and C. Pickart, personal communication. After induction with 0.08 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 30° C, 10 g of pelleted cells were recovered and lysed by freezing and thawing in 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm p-toluenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml DNase I. Following removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the 50–80% (NH4)2SO4 precipitate fraction was recovered and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The material was filtered through 20 ml of Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm p-toluenesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. The flow-through was concentrated and loaded onto a 44 × 1-cm column of Sephadex S-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The 16-kDa UbcH5 eluted between about 25 and 30 ml. The UbcH5-containing fractions were stored in aliquots with 0.1 mg/ml added ovalbumin. A 0–30% (NH4)2SO4 precipitated fraction of fraction II (DEAE-bound; Ref. 48Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) protein from rabbit reticulocyte lysate, generously provided by C. Pickart, was used as the starting material for the partial purification of E3 Ub-protein ligases that recognize the EMCV 3C protease. The Ubc5-dependent E3 activity was partially purified as follows. Eighty mg of 0–30% (NH4)2SO4 precipitated rabbit reticulocyte fraction II protein was loaded onto 4 ml of Q-Sepharose equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mmDTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA (TDE buffer). Following washing with 24 ml of TDE buffer, bound protein was eluted with a 45-ml linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 m NaCl in TDE. Fractions containing the E3 activity peak (eluting between about 0.30 and 0.35 mNaCl) were pooled and concentrated. This material (17 mg of protein) was loaded onto an 80 × 1-cm column of Sephadex S-200 equilibrated with TDE buffer. The E3 activity eluted between 27 and 32 ml. These fractions were pooled, concentrated, and then dialyzed against 1.0 m (NH4)2SO4in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 2 mm DTT (PD buffer), followed by dialysis against the same buffer containing 0.6 m (NH4)2SO4. The dialyzed material was loaded onto a column of 5 ml of methyl-HIC resin (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in PD buffer containing 0.6 m(NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with 2 volumes of the same buffer, and bound protein was eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient of 0.6–0.3 m(NH4)2SO4 in PD buffer. The fractions were desalted by multiple rounds of concentration and dilution in TDE buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin. The E3 activity eluted between 0.55 and 0.45 m(NH4)2SO4. The typical reconstitution assay reaction mixtures consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.6 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.6 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, either 1 or 9 μm EMCV 3C or 3C[LVV(41–43)AAA] proteases, 0.2 mm Ub or MeUb, 0.1 μm E1, approximately 1–2 μm UbcH5 or E2–14K, and up to 2 μg of E3-containing preparation, in a final volume of 8 or 12 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. Two-μl aliquots were removed from the mixtures at the indicated times and were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. 3C protease and Ub-3C protease conjugates were detected by Western blotting, using affinity purified antibodies against EMCV 3C protease (35Lawson T.G. Gronros D.L. Werner J.A. Wey A.C. DiGeorge A.M. Lockhart J.L. Wilson J.W. Wintrode P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28429-28435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as the primary antibody. Blot development was accomplished using secondary antibody-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (for 9 μm 3C protease reactions) or the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; for 1 μm 3C protease reactions). In order to determine whether the recognition of the EMCV 3C protease by the Ub-conjugating system occurs because of a discrete, identifiable structural feature within the substrate protein, several fusion and deletion mutants were prepared and evaluated. Portions of the EMCV 3C protease were first fused with portions of the poliovirus 3C protease, which is known to be a poor substrate for the Ub-mediated proteolytic system (36Gladding R.L. Haas A.L.

BCR-mediated cross-linking induces the rapid phosphorylation of protein tyrosine kinases. However, the pathways leading to the activation of downstream serine/threonine kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, p90Rsk, and p70S6 kinase (p70S6k) that mediate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle progression, gene transcription, and protein synthesis have not been delineated. We recently demonstrated that cross-linking of BCR leads to activation of p70S6k in B lymphocytes. In this report, we demonstrate that multiple protein tyrosine kinase-dependent signal transduction pathways induced by BCR lead to the activation of p70S6k. These distinct pathways exhibit different thresholds with respect to the extent of receptor cross-linking required for their activation. Activation of p70S6k by suboptimal doses of anti-Ig is Syk-dependent and is mediated by protein kinase C and phosphoinositol 3-kinase. Moreover, the activation of p70S6k results in phosphorylation of S6 protein which is important for ribosomal protein synthesis and may be coupled to BCR-induced protein and DNA synthesis in primary murine B cells.

The relationship between the defined early signal transduction events, intermediate signaling events, and the fate of B cells is not clear. We have been investigating the protein tyrosine kinase-dependent regulation of BCR-mediated activation of serine/threonine kinases. We demonstrated that ligation of BCR on the avian B cell line DT40 results in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and members of two families of ribosomal S6 kinases, p90Rsk and p70S6 kinase (p70S6k) (10Li H.-L.

However, the role of either MAPK or p70S6k in B cell proliferation has not been determined. Mitogen-induced activation of p70S6k is initiated by ligand binding to receptor tyrosine kinases in the case of PDGF and insulin stimulation, for example, or through activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases as in the case of T cell stimulation by IL-2 (30Valius M.

The essential role of these tyrosine kinases in the regulation of some early signaling events such as the activation of phospholipase-Cγ has been established (5Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp.

However, the pathways leading to the activation of the serine/threonine kinases such as MAPK, p90Rsk, and p70S6k that may be required for the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle progression, gene transcription, and protein translation associated with antigen receptor-mediated activation of B lymphocytes have not been delineated. In this report, we define the BCR-mediated protein tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling cascades that lead to activation of p70S6k. We futher demonstrate that the activation of p70S6k results in the phosphorylation of S6 protein that is important for ribosomal protein synthesis and may be coupled to BCR-induced DNA synthesis in primary murine B cells. Splenic B cells were isolated from 6- to 8-week-old CD2F1 mice as described (45Mishell B.B. Shiigi S.M. Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, CA1980Google Scholar). Freshly isolated splenocytes were depleted of red blood cells using hypotonic red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma). T cells were depleted by antibody (monoclonal anti-CD4 Ab (GK1.5), anti-CD8 Ab (3.168.8), and anti-Thy1.2 Ab (J1j))-dependent complement-mediated cytolysis using Low-Tox® guinea pig sera as a source of complement (Accurate Chemicals). The enrichment of B cells was over 85% as measured by reactivity with anti-B220 and fluorescence-activated flow cytometry. The purified B cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 3 h prior to stimulation. Primary B cells and DT40 cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-B220 mAb and mouse anti-chicken IgM mAb (M4), respectively, for 30 min at 4 °C. DT40 cells were then reacted with FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse Ab for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. These cells were then subjected to flow cytometric analysis on a FACScan and analyzed using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). The chicken B cell line, DT40, and mutant DT40 cells deficient in both Syk and Lyn (DT40Syk−Lyn−) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. DT40Lyn− and DT40Syk− cells were cultured in the same medium containing 2 mg/ml G418 (43Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Wild-type and an enzymatically inactive mutant of human Syk, SykK402R, were cloned into the expression vector pApuro (10Li H.-L. Forman M.S. Kurosaki T. Puré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18200-18208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and transfected into DT40Syk− cells by electroporation using a gene pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 330 V, 250 microfarads and selected in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Puromycin-resistant clones were initially screened by Southern blotting of genomic DNA and further selected for expression of comparable levels of surface immunoglobulin by flow cytometry and for expression of comparable amounts of wild-type Syk or SykK402R based on immunoblotting. All results are representative of at least three experiments using a minimum of two independent clones expressing wild-type Syk or SykK402R. For activation of p70S6k, cells in an exponential growth phase were serum-starved for 12 h prior to stimulation. DT40 cells were untreated or treated with rapamycin (Calbiochem) or 0.5 μm staurosporine (Sigma) for 15 min or 3 h, respectively. Cells (2 × 107 cells/ml) were then stimulated with indicated concentrations of mouse anti-chicken IgM mAb M4 or 100 nm phorbol ester (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu), Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were quickly chilled on ice and pelleted by centrifugation immediately after stimulation. Cell pellets were lysed in 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 100 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Clarified cell lysates were normalized based on protein concentration as determined using the BCA® kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting for each lysate. The post-nuclear extracts (1 mg) were incubated directly with polyclonal anti-p70S6k (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were precipitated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) for an additional 3 h incubation at 4 °C. The immune precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer containing 0.4% dithiothreitol and resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (National Diagnostics Inc.). Proteins less than 45 kDa were run off gels to obtain better resolution of the hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated forms of the proteins of interest and to maximize separation from the antibody used for immunoprecipitation. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to immunoblotting. The blots were blocked with TNB buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 75 mm NaCl, 3% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. The blots were then incubated with polyclonal anti-p7056k Ab followed by 1 μCi/ml iodinated protein A for 45 min at room temperature followed by autoradiography. For detection of in vivo phosphorylation of endogenous S6 protein, 100 μg of cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described above. Membranes were immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody against the phosphorylated S6 protein (a generous gift from Dr. Morris Birnbaum, University of Pennsylvania) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig. Reactivity was detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-p70S6kimmunoprecipitates were prepared as described above and washed once with kinase buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 30 μm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2). The immune complexes were then resuspended in 12.5 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml S6 peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 μCi of [32P-γ]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were terminated by boiling in 7.5 μl of 3× Laemmli buffer for 5 min. Samples were resolved on an 18.5% polyacrylamide gel which was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Splenic B cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with the indicated dose of rapamycin 15 min prior to and throughout the stimulation period. Cells (200 μl) were cultured in 96-well microtiter plates and stimulated with the indicated concentrations of F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgM in the presence or absence of baculovirus-derived murine IL-4 and soluble recombinant CD40 ligand (CD40L)/CD8 fusion protein (a generous gift from Dr. Jan Erikson, Wistar Institute) for 48 h. Cells were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine per well during the final 12 h of stimulation. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured using a Harvester 96® (Tomtec, OR) and analyzed using Matrix 96 software (Packard). Activation of p70S6k has been implicated in the regulation of several pivotal functions including translation, transcription, and cell growth in several cell types in response to growth factor (e.g.PDGF), cytokine (e.g. interleukin 2), or hormone (e.g. insulin) stimulation (24Calvo V.

However, the role of p70S6k in antigen receptor-mediated signaling is not known. We previously demonstrated that ligation of BCR can induce activation of p70S6k in the DT40 avian B cell line (10Li H.-L. Forman M.S. Kurosaki T. Puré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18200-18208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we extended this finding to primary splenic B cells and found that engagement of BCR can lead to activation of p70S6k as measured by shift in mobility of p70S6k on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis andin vitro kinase assays. Ligation of BCR with an optimal dose of anti-Ig induced maximal phosphorylation and activation of p70S6k in primary splenic B cells at 30 min after stimulation (Fig. 1 A). The BCR-mediated activation of p70S6k decreased to basal levels at 2 h after stimulation. The phosphorylation of p70S6k was also dependent on the dose of anti-Ig (Fig.1 B). Importantly, in vivo phosphorylation of S6 protein was also induced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 B). Together these data indicate that the degree to which p70S6k is activated is determined by the extent of receptor cross-linking. The immunosuppressive drug rapamycin selectively inhibits growth factor and IL-2-induced activation of p70S6k in fibroblasts and T cells, respectively (15Stewart M.J. Berry C.O. Zilberman F.

Inhibition of p70S6k by rapamycin also correlated with the inhibition of cell cycle progression of fibroblasts and T cells stimulated by mitogens (27Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S.

Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, targeted disruption of p70S6k established that p70S6k is required for in vivo phosphorylation of S6 protein in embryonic stem cells (20Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of p70S6k in downstream responses in B cells we examined the dose dependence and rapamycin sensitivity of anti-Ig-induced activation of p70S6k, S6 phosphorylation, and DNA synthesis. As expected, anti-Ig induced DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, the dose responses of anti-Ig-induced activation of p70S6k (Fig.1 B), DNA synthesis (Fig. 2 A), and S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B) were all similar. BCR-mediated activation of p70S6k and in vivo S6 phosphorylation was inhibited by rapamycin (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the inhibition of p70S6k by rapamycin correlated with the dose-dependent inhibition of BCR-mediated DNA synthesis by rapamycin (Fig. 2 A). The inhibition by rapamycin was not due to cytotoxicity since the BCR-mediated activation of p90Rsk was not affected (data not shown). Moreover, stimulation of rapamycin-treated B cells with IL-4 and CD40L rescued DNA synthesis in rapamycin-treated anti-Ig-stimulated B cells (Fig. 2 C). The effect of CD40L and IL-4 was not due to inactivation of rapamycin since BCR-mediated activation and phosphorylation of p70S6k were inhibited by rapamycin even in the presence of IL-4 and CD40L (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that BCR-mediated activation of p70S6k leads to the phosphorylation of endogenous S6 protein and may contribute to enhanced DNA synthesis in B cells. In addition, IL-4 and CD40L may synergize with BCR by inducing alternate signaling pathway(s) that are resistant to rapamycin and therefore do not require p70S6k but lead to DNA synthesis. Mitogen-induced activation of p70S6 kinase in other cell types is mediated either by receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. insulin receptor and PDGF receptor) or through cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (IL-2 receptor). In addition, the activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases is critical for antigen receptor-mediated B cell activation (1Igarashi H. Kuwahara K. Nomura J. Matsuda A. Kikuchi K. Inui S. Sakaguchi N.

It belongs to the Zn2Cys6 zinc cluster protein family, but contains some striking differences compared with other proteins of this group. In this report, we show that no dimerization element is present in the entire AlcR protein which occurs in solution as a monomer and binds also to its cognate sites as a monomer. Another important feature of AlcR is its unique specificity for single sites occurring naturally as inverted or direct repeats and sharing a common motif, 5′-(T/A)GCGG-3′. Like most other Zn2Cys6proteins, AlcR contacts directly with the CGG triplet and, in addition, the upstream adjacent guanine is required for high affinity binding.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation is mediated by the binding of AlcR to different cognate sites, encompassing the same consensus core, 5′-(T/A)GCGG-3′, organized as direct and inverted repeats, located upstream of these genes (3Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). AlcR is a fungal transcription factor of the zinc binuclear cluster family, containing six cysteines and two zinc atoms (C6 protein class) (7Kulmburg P. Prangé T. Mathieu M. Sequeval D. Scazzocchio C. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Sequeval D. Felenbok B. Mol. Gen.

However, AlcR is distinguishable from other proteins in this family by its structural and binding properties. It has an asymmetric structure resulting from an additional 16 residues between the third and the fourth cysteines compared with 6–8 residues usually found in the other proteins of this class (7Kulmburg P. Prangé T. Mathieu M. Sequeval D. Scazzocchio C. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in this loop, the proline residue conserved in all the zinc binuclear cluster domains and which was shown to be important for zinc binding, as stated for GAL4 (10Johnston M. Dover J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2401-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and more recently for PrnA (11Scazzocchio C. Martinelli S. Kinghorn J.R. Genetics and Physiology of Aspergillus nidulans. 29. Elsevier Scientific, Amsterdam1994: 259-277Google Scholar), is not present in AlcR. However, these differences have no effect on the distance between the two zinc atoms and between zinc and sulfydryl ligands of cysteine (12Ascone I. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Dexpert H. Felenbok B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) which are similar to those found in the solved structure of GAL4, PPR1, and PUT3 (13Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 14Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C.

Biol. 1997; 4: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Another important feature of AlcR is the absence of a coiled-coil dimerization region following the C6 zinc cluster in the other proteins (5Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two stretches of leucine heptad repeats, downstream of the zinc cluster, are interrupted by several proline residues known to disrupt a continuous α-helix. NMR studies have shown that the isolated AlcR zinc binuclear cluster domain (residues 1–60) binds to a single copy site as a monomer, albeit with a low affinity (9Cerdan R. Collin D. Lenouvel F. Felenbok B. Guittet E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). More recently, binding experiments performed with a longer AlcR protein (1–197), containing the region downstream of the zinc cluster, have clearly indicated that one AlcR molecule binds with high affinity to DNA single sites (5 × 10−8m) (5Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Panozzo C. Capuano V. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using a transcription-translation assay, we have shown that no dimerization sequence is present up to residue 197 which comprises one-fourth of the protein length (5Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this work, we wanted to address several questions. First, it was important to determine if any functional dimerization element other than those generally found in the proteins of the C6 class was present in AlcR, downstream of residue 197. Second, since the AlcR consensus core includes both the CGG triplet found to interact with the other well defined zinc binuclear cluster proteins such as GAL4, PPR1, PUT3 (13Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 14Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Swaminathan K. Flynn P. Reece R.J. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 1997; 4: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the GCG triplet shown to interact with a few other C6 proteins (17Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the mode of recognition of AlcR toward its DNA sites was investigated. Third, it appears that AlcR specificity toward its DNA target is different from the other proteins of the C6 class, thus the role of the flanking regions outside the consensus core was determined. Since AlcR natural targets are organized as direct or inverted repeats, the size and the composition of the spacer are also of special interest in the in vitro study of AlcR binding. In order to answer these questions, a functional analysis of the putative dimerization regions of AlcR has been performed as well as a systematic study by site-directed mutagenesis of AlcR binding to direct or inverted repeat physiological targets and to an artificial single site. Escherichia colistrains CSH50: Δ(proLac) F−(proABLacIqZ) ΔM15,traD36 was used in phage immunity tests. Wild type phage λ was employed for immunity tests. The pCIR1–7 plasmids were obtained from the pC132 vector (18Castagnoli L. Vetriani C. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) which harbors a CI rop fusion by replacing the rop gene with the alcR regions of interest. The different AlcR domains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotides containing SalI andBamHI sites at their 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction products were cut by SalI andBamHI and cloned in the pC132 plasmid treated with the same enzymes to excise the rop sequence. To generate plasmids pCIR8 and pCIR9 containing the alcR fusion with thecI repressor and the rop genes, thealcR fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction primed from specific oligonucleotides containing SalI sites at both ends and cloned into the pC132 plasmid cut by SalI. In all these constructs the AlcR domains were fused in-frame with the λ phage CI repressor NH2-terminal domain at the 5′ end and the β-galactosidase α-peptide gene at the 3′ end. The AlcR coding sequences were separated from the α-peptide by an amber codon introduced during amplification to allow for synthesis of a bipartite (CI:AlcR), tripartite (CI:AlcR:α-peptide), or tetrapartite (CI:AlcR:Rop:α-peptide) fusion protein depending on the suppressor background of the host. The supE (71.18) strain bearing fusion plasmids forms blue colonies on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactoside indicator plates. Bacterial cells transformed by plasmids were assayed by spot tests for sensitivity to λ phages at different concentrations on lawns of transformed bacteria. The plasmid expressing AlcR(1–197) tagged with 6xHis was constructed as described previously (5Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The AlcR protein expressed was partially purified on a Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column at up to 20% of homogeneity and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Oligonucleotide probes containing either direct repeat targets a orc or inverted repeat target b from thealcA promoter or an artificial single copy sitesc and its mutated derivatives were used in most gel shift experiments. Sequences of these probes, as present on the top strand of the alcA promoter sequence, are given below: a, 5′-CCCACTTGTCCGTCCGCATCGGCATCCGCAGCTCGGG-3′;b, 5′-GATGCATGCGGAACCGCACGAGGGC-3′;c, 5′-CTTTCTGGTACTGTCCGCACGGGATGTCCGCACGGAGA-3′. The conserved repeats are marked in boldface type. The sequence of a single copy site probe sc and its mutated variants is indicated in Table II. Probes with a modified spacer region (underlined below) have the following sequence: inverted repeats: N2, 5′-ATGCATGCGG GC CCGCACGAGGGC-3′; N3, 5′-GATGCATGCGG AAA CCGCACGAGGGC-3′; N12, 5′-GATGCATGCGG TTCAAATAAGAT CCGCACGAGGGC-3′; N17, 5′-GATGCATGCGG TTCAAATCTATAAAGAT CCGCACGAGGGC-3′; direct repeat, N10, 5′-CTTTCTGGTACTGTCCG CACGGGATGT CCGCACGGAGA-3′; N13, 5′-CTTTCTGGTACTGTCCG CACGGAGAGATGT CCGCACGGAGA-3′, where N corresponds to the number of nucleotides separating the CGG triplets in the consensus core. Sequences of the other probes used in this work are shown in the figures. In all cases, only the top strand of the oligonucleotides is shown. The binding reactions were analyzed by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described previously (5Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In experiments determining the relative binding efficiencies of oligonucleotides containing sc or mutated sequences, the protein concentration of AlcR(1–197) was calibrated to yield approximately 30–50% of bound probe.

Open table in a new tab Methylation interference and depurination interference footprinting assays were carried out as described earlier (4Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, 105 cpm of end-labeled single strand DNA probe were annealed with the complementary, non-labeled strand and then subjected to chemical modifications either with dimethyl sulfate, for partial methylation of guanines, or piperidine formate, for partial depurination, according to the procedure of Maxam and Gilbert (19Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 497-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, the modified DNA probes were incubated with sufficient partially purified AlcR(1–197) protein (300–500 ng) to bind approximately 30–50% of the probe. The protein bound and free DNAs were separated by preparative gel mobility shift technique and electroeluted from gel slices. Recovered DNAs were treated with 1 m piperidine and resolved on a 16% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. A full-length AlcR protein (residues 1 to 821) and a truncated NirA protein (residues 1 to 222) were expressed in vitro using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the recommendations of the supplier. For this purpose the AlcR coding sequence was cloned into the T7 expression vector pET-22b. The pNirA(1–222) plasmid expressing NirA (1–222) was kindly provided by Dr. M. I. Muro-Pastor. 3–20 μl of translation products were incubated for 1 h with 0.005% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and afterward analyzed either by 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. Our previous studies performed with a truncated protein predicted that the active form of AlcR binds DNA in vitro as a monomer (5Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This result was further confirmed by calibrated gel filtration chromatography. The AlcR(1–197) protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa (data not shown), a value close to that expected for a monomer (22 kDa). Nevertheless, the truncated protein could be lacking a downstream dimerization domain. In order to determine if AlcR regions other than those usually found in the C6 class proteins could drive dimerization of AlcR, another method based on the property of the bacteriophage λ CI repressor to function as a dimer was used (20Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). When a dimerization element is fused to the NH2-terminal DNA-binding domain of the λ CI repressor,E. coli cells are immune to superinfection by λ phage, while cells that contain the CI DNA-binding domain alone are sensitive. This system was used previously to analyze the residues involved in the leucine zipper from the yeast activator GCN4 (20Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), in TAT homodimerization (21Battaglia P.A. Longo F. Ciotta C. Del Grosso M.F. Ambrosini E. Gigliani F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Myc/Max heterodimer formation (22Marchetti A. Abril-Marti M. Illi B. Cesareni G. Nasi S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and dimerization of the NirA zinc cluster protein (23Strauss J. Muro Pastor M.I. Scazzocchio C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Gene fusions between the NH2-terminal domain of λ CI repressor and overlapping AlcR sequences covering the whole protein (1–821), including the zinc cluster domain (1–59), were performed (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). None of the AlcR sequences tested conferred immunity to λ infection when transformed into E. coli, implying that no dimerization element was present (TableI). One could argue that the lack of dimerization could be the result of a possible insolubility or misfolding of the chimeric λ CI-AlcR protein. This hypothesis was ruled out by assaying the β-galactosidase activity driven by all the fusion constructs (see “Experimental Procedures”). In order to ensure that AlcR sequences did not prevent per se, dimerization of λ CI repressor, a control dimerization element, originating from the Rop protein, was introduced at the carboxyl terminus of AlcR sequences (pCIR8, pCIR9). Results presented in Table I show clearly that this Rop sequence is able to drive λ CI dimerization when fused at the carboxyl-terminal region of AlcR, indicating that AlcR sequences did not prevent dimerization. Another hypothesis could be that the AlcR dimerization element consists of separate domains, comprising interacting α helical regions. The only possibility, according to computer prediction analysis of AlcR (24.Lenouvel, F., Ph.D. thesis, 1996, University of Paris-Sud, France.Google Scholar) and preliminary results of AlcR NMR studies, 1R. Cerdan, F. Penin, F. Lenouvel, B. Felenbok, and E. Guittet, unpublished results. would be the interaction of two regions, one of 16 residues between the third and fourth cysteines and the second region downstream of the zinc cluster at residues 310 to 343. Results presented in Table I (pCIR4) argue against this assumption. In fact, the AlcR region from residues 1 to 367 does not confer immunity to λ infection whereas the AlcR-Rop fusion does. Therefore, the absence of immunity, whatever thealcR sequence fused to λ CI repressor, indicates that under these conditions the AlcR dimerization sequence, if any exists, is either not functional or not strong enough to promote in vivo formation of dimers of CI repressor. To obtain additional evidence that AlcR does not form dimers, at least in solution, we compared the dimerization of AlcR and NirA by cross-linking each protein in solution. NirA has been recently shown to form stable dimers (23Strauss J. Muro Pastor M.I. Scazzocchio C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A full-length AlcR protein and a truncated NirA(1–222) version containing its dimerization interface were translated in vitro and after treatment with glutaraldehyde were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig.1, the majority of NirA(1–222) dimerizes whereas AlcR(1–821) stays monomeric in solution even in conditions when the translated product is increased 7-fold in the reaction. Our previous in vitro DNA binding studies using alcAphysiological repeated sites have shown the formation of two complexes (a fast migrating complex CI and a slow migrating complex CII) with symmetric sites, which correspond to the binding of one and two AlcR molecules to both sites, respectively (Refs. 5Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and 6Panozzo C. Capuano V. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and Fig.4 A). The apparent K d for both complexes was not significantly different suggesting a lack of cooperativity (5Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, one retarded complex CI is preferentially observed with all the direct repeat targets tested. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that AlcR is able to recognize a single copy site (5Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Cerdan R. Collin D. Lenouvel F. Felenbok B. Guittet E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with the same range of affinity. Thus, it seemed necessary to examine for all these types of DNA targets whether AlcR uses a general mode of recognition or a pattern of DNA-protein interaction that is dependent upon the target configuration (direct or inverted repeat or a single copy site). Two different footprint interference techniques, namely methylation and depurination interference, were applied to establish the base-specific contacts within direct repeat targets a and c and inverted repeat site b in the alcA promoter (see Fig. 2). All these targets have been shown to be functional in the alcA promoter region (6Panozzo C. Capuano V. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed with AlcR(1:197), His-tagged protein, which contains a region downstream of the zinc binuclear cluster necessary for high affinity binding (5Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Figure 2Depurination (G + A) and methylation (G) interference of contacts between AlcR(1–197) and its DNA-binding sites in the alcA promoter.

For experimental details, see “Experimental Procedures.” Arrows indicate the orientation of the conserved sequence 5′-TGCGG-3′. Positions numbered above the sequence correspond to 5′ to 3′ orientation of this motif.Circles represent purine contacts identified by base-missing interference and squares symbolize G contacts identified by methylation interference in the slow migrating complex CII. In all cases, closed symbols denote strong and open symbols weak base contacts. A summary of the interference assays is presented at the bottom of each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For both asymmetric targets a and c, only a slight reduction of signal at positions encompassing the consensus motif 5′-GCGG-3′ and the adjacent A (position 6) was detected (Fig. 2,A and B). The equal reduction of band intensities for both repeats is indicative of a random occupancy of binding sites which results in formation of one retarded complex, CI. Our present results might seem contradictory to the previous footprinting data which demonstrated that only one of the two binding sites, namelyc2, can be occupied by AlcR. However, the oligonucleotide probe utilized earlier was 6 bp shorter at the 5′ end than the one we used in the current studies. Apparently, the limited size of flanking regions impaired the AlcR binding to the adjacent sitec1. Similarly, AlcR exhibits the same manner of site recognition, when fixed on the symmetric target b, giving rise to the fast migrating complex, CI. Only a slight interference is noticable by both methylation and missing-contact footprint analyses (Fig.2 D). Thus, no site preference for binding of the first AlcR molecule to either direct or inverted repeat sites in thealcA promoter was observed. A depurination footprint pattern obtained with complex CII revealed a strong interference of all the G residues within the consensus motif in both strands. In addition, two central A residues separating inverted repeats exhibited strong interference (Fig. 2 D). Methylation of two G residues at positions 2 and 4 in both strands interfered strongly with AlcR binding, while methylation of the adjacent G (position 5) had weaker effects. These results indicate that AlcR interacts mainly in the major groove, although minor groove contacts exist. For example, contacts with N3 of A in the spacer sequence in the symmetric repeatb, as shown by methylation footprinting data, occur in the minor groove (Fig. 2 D). Within each recognition motif AlcR makes direct, sequence-specific contacts with bases on the same strand, since methylation of the N-7 position of G (position 3) in the C-rich strand of the consensus core resulted in weak, if any, interference. Footprint experiments performed with an artificial single copy site (sc), designed after disruption of one of the repeats in the symmetric target b, suggest that the AlcR molecule establishes direct base-specific contacts within the conserved repeat and does not interact with neighboring nucleotides (Fig.2 C). The pattern of depurination interference appeared to be similar for all types of targets (inverted or direct repeat or a single copy site), indicating that AlcR uses a unique strategy for DNA recognition. Most of the zinc binuclear cluster proteins have been shown to interact directly with CGG triplets present at the ends of their cognate targets, whereas some activators of this class are able to recognize the CGC triplet (25Todd R.B. Andrianopoulos A. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 388-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). According to footprinting data, the AlcR-binding site represents a combination of both triplets found on opposite strands. To distinguish among these various putative sites as well as to examine the contribution of each interacting base, we tested the effect of base substitutions within the consensus motif using saturation mutagenesis. AlcR binding affinities for all mutant-binding sites were estimated from gel band shift experiments and compared with that of the"

Mouse and bovine αENaC were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNTTM-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μl of in vitro translated αmENaC was diluted to 0.5 ml of a buffer containing 0.4% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitors mixture (10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm antipain, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A). Solubilized proteins were preabsorbed for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein G-agarose, centrifuged to pellet the protein A-agarose, and then incubated for 16 h with RA6.3 (1:500 dilution) in the absence or presence of an excess of the peptide DAVREWYRFHYINILSRLSD (20 μg) at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose (50 μl) was then added, and after a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the agarose beads were washed three times with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors and twice with a buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors. Precipitated samples were eluted into SDS-PAGE sample buffer (3% (w/v) SDS, 15% (w/v) sucrose, and 92.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9). Samples were incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Alternatively, in vitro translated αbENaC (5 μl) was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (23Coupaye-Gerard B. Bookstein C. Duncan P. Chen X.Y. Smith P.R. Musch M. Ernst S.A. Chang E.B. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1639-C1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Coupaye-Gerard B. Zuckerman J.B.

Western blot analysis was performed using an alkaline phosphatase-linked chemiluminescent detection system (Western Light Plus) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in a blocking buffer consisting of 68 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4 (PBS), supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) purified casein, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with blocking buffer containing either the antibody RA6.3 (1:500 dilution) in the absence or presence of the peptide DAVREWYRFHYINILSRLSD. Membranes were subsequently washed twice with PBS supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and then incubated with a biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:20,000 dilution in blocking buffer) at room temperature for 30 min. Membranes were washed twice in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:20,000 dilution in blocking buffer) at room temperature for 30 min, and washed again three times with PBS and Tween. The membranes were washed in assay buffer (0.1 mdiethanolamine, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 10), incubated for 5 min in a substrate solution (0.25 mm CSPD in assay buffer) at room temperature, and then exposed to film. The mouse Cγ primer was the 15-mer oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-GGCCAGTGGATAGAC-3′. The mouse Cγ probe was 5′-TGGGG(CG)TGTTGTTTT-3′. The mouse Cκ primer was 5′-CTGCTCACTGGATGGTGGGA-3′, and the Cκ probe was 5′-AGATGGATACAGTTGGT-3′. The anchor primer for polymerase chain reaction was a 33-mer oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-CACTGCAGAAGCTTGGATCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′ containing PstI,HindIII, and BamHI restriction sites. Probes were 5′-end radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.31-11.33Google Scholar) and purified over NENSORB-20 cartridges (NEN Life Science Products). The nucleotide sequence of the H region of RA6.3 was obtained using methods described previously (15Lin C. Kieber-Emmons T. Villalobos A.P. Foster M.H. Wahlgren C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2805-2813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from RA6.3 hybridoma cells cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum by the guanidinium/CsCl method as described previously. Reverse transcription was performed using RNA as a template with Moloney mouse leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and Cγ oligonucleotide primer. Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (26Gubler U.

T4 DNA polymerase was used to generate blunt ended cDNA, which was ligated into SmaI-digested and dephosphorylated M13. E. coli DH5-αF′IQ were transformed with recombinant phagemids and clones screened with the Cγ (H chain) oligonucleotide probe (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.31-11.33Google Scholar). Positive plaques were purified and sequenced by incorporation of dideoxynucleotides using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit. Nucleotide sequences were confirmed by sequencing a second independent clone. The method of random extension of cDNA ends was used to obtain the L chain variable region cDNA. Reverse transcription was performed using RNA from RA6.3 hybridoma cell as a template with Moloney mouse leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and Cκ oligonucleotide primer at 37 °C for 1 h. An oligo(dG) tail was added to the cDNA with terminal deoxynucleotide transferase. A polymerase chain reaction was performed using poly(dC) and the Cκ 3′-primer to amplify oligo(dG)-tailed cDNA. Samples were initially denatured at 92 °C for 8 min followed by 35 cycles of 92 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min and a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. Products of the correct predicted size were cloned into a pCR vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the Cκ oligonucleotide as a sequencing primer, as described above. Antibody modeling was performed as described previously (15Lin C. Kieber-Emmons T. Villalobos A.P. Foster M.H. Wahlgren C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

CDRs and the framework regions of identified templates were mutated to those of the respective antibody H and L chains using Insight II (Biosym Technologies) or automatically assigned by AbM. The program Discover (version 2.95, Biosym Technologies) was used for conformational calculations with the supplied consistent valence force field parameters. The respective modeled structure was energy optimized to convergence. Molecular dynamics at 300 K and 600 K was used to alleviate any further close contacts within the antibodies (15Lin C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18085-18092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the exploration of the potential epitope recognized by RA6.3, we made use of the program LUDI (39Bohm H.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1992; 6: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) (Ligand Design, Biosym Technologies) to identify amino acid residues that potentially interact with the RA6.3 combining site as described previously (20Murali R. Kieber-Emmons T. J. Mol. Recognit. 1997; 10: 269-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A LUDI search was performed using standard default values and fragment library supplied with the program to identify organic fragments that potentially interact with residues within the RA6.3 binding site. Amino acid residues with side chains similar in structure to these organic fragments were identified. In evaluating these fragments, we compared amino acid residues identified by LUDI relative to the VRDWYRFH sequence such that the fragments could occupy nonredundant sites, be spatially far enough to accommodate the peptide backbone, and follow the appropriate ordered sequence of amino acid residues. In effect, one wants to “stitch” the fragments together to form a peptide that fits within the RA6.3 combining site. To identify possible fragments that are similar to the VRDWYRFH sequence, the radius of interaction, which defines the size of spheres in which LUDI is to fit appropriate fragments, was set as incrementing radii from 5 to 14 Å. The VRDWYRFH peptide was built using Insight II and positioned relative to the docked LUDI fragments. The peptide backbone and side chain torsional angles were rotated until the side chains of the peptide were approximate to the corresponding LUDI fragments. The peptide-RA6.3 complex was subjected to energy optimization and molecular dynamics simulations to relieve steric overlap. RA6.3 is a monoclonal antibody raised by an antiidiotypic approach designed to be directed against an amiloride binding site within the epithelial Na+ channel (18Kleyman T.R. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Ernst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3907-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that RA6.3 immunoprecipitates a complex of polypeptides expressed at the apical plasma membrane of A6 epithelia. Cells were treated with tunicamycin to inhibitN-linked glycosylation in order to identify non-N-linked glycosylated polypeptide(s) recognized by RA6.3. A6 cells were incubated overnight (16 h) in the presence (0.5 or 5 μg/ml) or absence of tunicamycin. Treatment of A6 cells with tunicamycin for 16 h led to a reduction in short circuit current from 12.4 μA × cm−2 (0 tunicamycin) to 0.7 μA × cm−2 (0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin) and 0.5 μA × cm−2 (5 μg/ml tunicamycin). The A6 monolayers were metabolically labeled in the absence or presence (0.5 or 5 μg/ml) of tunicamycin, detergent solubilized, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with RA6.3. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In the absence of tunicamycin, RA6.3 immunoprecipitated a complex of polypeptides from metabolically labeled A6 cells, as we have observed previous (18Kleyman T.R. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Ernst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3907-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kleyman T.R. Coupaye-Gerard B. Ernst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9622-9628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A, left panel). However, in the presence of 0.5 or 5 μg/ml tunicamycin, RA6.3 immunoprecipitated a 72-kDa polypeptide from A6 cells, consistent with the predicted size of nonglycosylated αxENaC (Fig. 1 A,left panel) (41Puoti A. May A. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C188-C197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 72-kDa polypeptide was not immunoprecipitated when control ascites was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, an additional polypeptide was immunoprecipitated with an apparent molecular mass of 35–45 kDa and is in agreement with the mass of a novel short chain alcohol dehydrogenase we cloned previously from an A6 cell expression library based on its binding to RA6.3 (42Worrell R.T. Lin C. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9 (abstr.): 309Google Scholar). Treatment of A6 epithelia with tunicamycin altered the profile of total labeled cellular proteins (Fig. 1 A, right panel). To provide additional evidence that RA6.3 recognizes the α-subunit of ENaC, in vitro transcription/translation of mouse αENaC was performed in the presence of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine. The translated product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig.2 A). A 72-kDa polypeptide was observed for mouse αENaC, in agreement with its predicted molecular mass. Alternatively, the translation product was product subjected to immunoprecipitation with RA6.3 (1:500 dilution) in the absence or presence of the peptide DAVREWYRFHYINILSRLSD, corresponding to residues 273–292 of rat αENaC, residues 273–292 within mouse αENaC (with the exception that residue 291 in the mouse sequence is Pro), and residues 226–245 within bovine αENaC (with the exception that residues 243–245 in the bovine sequence are RRQ). RA6.3 specifically immunoprecipitated in vitro translated mouse αENaC (Fig. 2 A). We also observed that RA6.3 specifically recognized in vitro translated bovine αENaC (Fig. 2 B). RA6.3 H chain variable region cDNA was synthesized and introduced into M13. I"

Ten distinct IRFs have been described and most are expressed in a variety of cells except for interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) and lymphoid-specific IRF/Pip that are thought to be exclusively expressed in lymphoid cells. We show here for the first time that ICSBP is constitutively and inducibly expressed in the mouse lens. In contrast to lymphoid cells with exclusive expression of ICSBP in the nucleus, ICSBP is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of the lens cell. However, ICSBP in the nucleus is of lower apparent molecular weight. We further show that the ICSBP promoter is constitutively bound by lens nuclear factors and that its activation requires binding of additional factors including STAT1. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of ICSBP gene by interferon γ is accompanied by selective nuclear localization of ICSBP in proliferating epithelial cells but not in the nuclei of nondividing cells in the lens fiber compartment. Constitutive and inducible expression of ICSBP in the ocular lens and differential regulation of its subcellular localization in the developing lens suggest that ICSBP may have nonimmunity related functions and that the commonly held view that it is lymphoid-specific be modified.

Klamp T. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). In addition to their well defined roles in host defense against infectious agents, they have been associated with the regulation of cellular immunity, cell growth (1Boehm U. Klamp T. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar, 2Taniguchi T. Harada H. Lamphier M. L. Cancer Res. Clin.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2016-2022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of IFNs is underscored by the expression of their receptors in virtually all mammalian cell types and by the fact that they regulate the expression of more than 50 cellular genes (1Boehm U. Klamp T. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar, 5Valente G. Ozmen L. Novelli F. Geuna M. Palestro G. Forni G. Garotta G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2403-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interaction of IFNs with their cell surface receptor leads to activation of protein tyrosine kinases, JAK1, JAK2, or Tyk2, which in turn phosphorylate and activate members of a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors called STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) (6Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 7Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STATs form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the nucleus where they bind to well defined DNA sequences called GAS (gamma interferonactivation site) or ISREs (IFN-stimulated responseelements) and activate the transcription of genes coding for members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors (8Decker T. Kovarik P. Meinke A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 9Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). IRFs are important mediators of transcriptional activation or repression of IFN-regulatable genes. They are characterized by a 115-amino acid N-terminal DNA-binding domain that interacts with ISRE motifs of IFN-regulatable genes (9Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Direct and indirect evidence indicate that the C-terminal portion of IRFs contains a protein-protein interaction domain able to function as transcriptional activators and/or repressors (9Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 10Sharf R. Azriel A. Lejbkowicz F. Winograd S.S. Ehrlich R. Levi B.-Z. J. Biol.

Ten members of the IRF family have been identified, and they include ICSBP, ISGF3γ/p48, IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, IRF-4/lymphoid-specific IRF/Pip/ICSAT, IRF-5, IRF-6, IRF-7, and vIRF (9Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). IRF-1 and IRF-2 are the best characterized members of this family and were initially identified by studies of the transcriptional regulation of the human IFNβ gene (11Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y.

IRF-1 is a tumor suppressor (13Taniguchi T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas IRF-2 is oncogenic (14Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S.

In these mice, the normal pattern of endogenous lens gene expression is perturbed, and the developmental fate of cells destined to become lens fiber cells is altered. It was during the course of studies to establish a biological link between expression of IFNγ and the observed developmental defects that we discovered that several IRFs are constitutively expressed in the mouse lens. In this report, we present evidence that ICSBP is constitutively and inducibly expressed in the mouse lens. BALB/c wild type (WT) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). CD-1 WT mice were from Charles River (Raleigh, NC). Generation of the BALB/c IFNγ transgenic (TR) mice has previously been described (20Egwuagu C.E. Sztein J. Chan C.C. Reid W. Mahdi R.

Eye Res. 1990; 9: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Paul Russell (NEI, NIH, Bethesda, MD), was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The CRLE2 and 1AMLE 6 mouse epithelial cell lines (23Sax C.M. Dziedzic D.C. Piatigorsky J. Reddan J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), kind gifts from Dr. Christina M. Sax (NEI, NIH), were propagated in minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% rabbit serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were treated with murine recombinant IFNγ (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 100 units/ml for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Some cells were propagated in medium containing the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma) at 35 μg/ml for 30 min followed by addition of IFNγ and incubation for 2 h. Lenses from 6-week-old WT or TR mouse littermates were carefully dissected and washed before RNA isolation to avoid any possible contamination by other tissues. Total RNA was isolated from the lenses or cultured lens cells as recommended for the TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). All RNA samples were digested with RNase-free DNase 1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation in 0.4m LiCl. cDNA synthesis was performed at 42 °C for 1 h with 10 μg of total RNA, 0.3 μg of oligo(dT)(12–16) and 1000 units Superscript Reverse Transcriptase II (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 50 μl. For each RNA preparation, a negative control reaction was performed without reverse transcriptase. After purification of the cDNA, hot start PCR assays were performed with AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Samples were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min to activate the AmpliTaq Gold, and amplification was carried out for 25 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 63 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, and this was followed by a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. All the primer pairs used for PCR amplifications spanned at least one intron, making it possible to distinguish between amplification products derived from cDNA and those resulting from any contaminating genomic DNA templates. The sequence of the PCR primers used are: for mouse G3PDH, 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC-3′ and 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ (24Sabath D.E. Broome H.E. Prystowsky M.B. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and for mouse ICSBP, 5′-GCTGCGG CAGTGGCTGATCGAACAGATCG-3′ and 5′-AGTGGCAGGCCTGCACTGGGCTGCTG-3′ (25Kanno Y. Kozak C.A. Schindler C. Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 3: 3951-3963Crossref Google Scholar). For Southern blot analysis, the amplified fragments were electrophoresed in agarose gels, transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with fluorescein-dUTP 3′-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe, internal to the corresponding PCR primers. Probe labeling and signal detection were performed with the ECL 3′-oligolabeling and detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA (30 μg) was fractionated on a 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized for 12 h at 65 °C in hybridization solution containing 5 × 106 cpm/ml of probe as described (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Stuhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 4.9-4.10Google Scholar). ICSBP or β-actin-specific cDNA fragments were labeled to high specific activity (>108 cpm/μg) with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (oligolabeling kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as hybridization probes. After two high stringency washes in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, signals were detected by autoradiography at −70 °C. with Kodak X-Omat AR film and Cronex intensifying screens. Lenses derived from 6-week-old WT or TR mouse littermates were disrupted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 μmpepstatin, 0.1 μm aprotinin, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μmE-64 on ice. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and protein levels were determined by Coomassie Blue dye binding method as recommended for Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). For analysis of the lens epithelial cell lines, cells were cultured for 2 h in medium alone or medium containing 100 units/ml IFNγ. The cells were lysed and fractionated to cytosolic and nuclear fractions as described previously (27Politis A.D. Ozato K. Coligan J.E. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2270-2278PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were also obtained from the EL4 lymphoma cell line (ATCC TIB-39) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and BALB/c mouse spleen cells. All samples were heated for 10 min at 95 °C in 1× sample buffer and electrophoresed in 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gel. The gel was electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and probed with either goat anti-mouse ICSBP polyclonal antibodies (1:2000) from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA) or a rabbit anti-mouse ICSBP polyclonal antibody (1:2000) fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Mouse αA-crystallin-specific antibody was kindly provided by Sam Zigler (NEI, NIH). Preimmune serum was also used in parallel as control. Signals were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary F(ab′)2 antibodies using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Seventeen day mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in Ameraffin tissue embedding medium (Baxter). Tissue sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated through a graded alcohol series, and used for immunostaining by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA.). After preincubation for 30 min with 2% blocking serum, sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with antibodies (2 μg/ml) specific to mouse ICSBP (Santa Cruz). Control sections received the appropriate normal serum. In addition, antibody specificity control experiments were carried out by incubating the primary antibody with a 10-fold excess of a blocking peptide specific for the immunogenic epitope (ICSBP amino acid 407–425) for 2 h. The neutralized antibody was then used for immunostaining reactions with control tissue sections. All sections were subsequently incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature, and signal was visualized with diaminobenzidine-H2O2 as recommended (Vector). In some experiments, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Lens nuclear extracts were prepared either from 1–3-day-old WT CD-1 mouse lenses or cultured lens epithelial cells as described previously (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Buffer used for nuclear protein extraction contained the following protease inhibitors: 2 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 0.1 μm aprotinin, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μmE-64. Protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding as recommended for Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagen kit (Pierce), and extracts were stored at −70 °C until use. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 0.14 μg/μl poly(dI-dC) were incubated on ice for 10 min. 32P-Labeled double-stranded DNA probe (50,000 cpm) was added and incubated for an additional 20 min on ice. Samples were electrophoresed in 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer. For competition experiments, the nuclear extract was preincubated with unlabeled probe and poly(dI-dC) for 20 min on ice prior to the addition of labeled probe. The sequences used for the double-stranded probes or competitors are: ICSBP pIRE/GAS, 5′-AGTGATTTCTCGGAAAGAGAGCGCTTC-3′ (−175 to −149), and ICSBP-IRE, 5′-GTAAAGAGA GAAAAGGACTC-3′ (-217 to −198) (25Kanno Y. Kozak C.A. Schindler C. Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 3: 3951-3963Crossref Google Scholar). For supershift assays, STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, or STAT4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was added to the binding buffer containing the nuclear extract and preincubated on ice for 10 min. The 32P-labeled probe was then added, and the entire mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min on ice before electrophoresis. We had previously generated TR mice with ectopic expression of IFNγ in the lens to study the paracrine effects of IFNγ in the eye (20Egwuagu C.E. Sztein J. Chan C.C. Reid W. Mahdi R. Nussenblatt R.B. Chepelinsky A.B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 332-341PubMed Google Scholar, 21Egwuagu C.E. Sztein J. Chan C.C. Mahdi R. Nussenblatt R.B. Chepelinsky A.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined mRNA and protein levels of IFNγ-inducible transcription factors in the lenses of WT and TR mouse littermates to determine whether there is any correlation between enhanced expression of members of the IRF family of transcription factors and the abnormal lens phenotype observed in our TR mice. We found that both IRF-1 and IRF-2 are constitutively expressed in the lens and the levels of IRF-1 is markedly enhanced in the TR mouse lens (data not shown). Most surprising, we found ICSBP to be constitutively and inducibly expressed in the mouse lens as indicated by reverse transcribed PCR and Western blot analyses (Fig.1). These results have been confirmed by six independent experiments, and the authenticity of the ICSBP transcripts has been verified by cDNA sequencing; the nucleotide sequence of the ICSBP transcripts isolated from the lens is identical to published sequences reported for ICSBP derived from mouse hematopoietic cells (15Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Mak W.-H. Marks M.S. Levi B.-Z. Flanagan J.R. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3743-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Detection of ICSBP transcripts in the WT lens was unexpected because constitutive transcription of the ICSBP gene is thought to be restricted to B-lymphocytes (15Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Mak W.-H. Marks M.S. Levi B.-Z. Flanagan J.R. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3743-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 19Holtschke E. Lohler J.

Analysis of rat and bovine lenses reveal that the ICSBP protein and mRNA are also expressed in these species (data not shown). This is the first time that constitutive expression or transcriptional activation of the ICSBP gene has been demonstrated in mammalian cells that are not directly involved in immunological responses. As the vertebrate lens is comprised of undifferentiated, proliferating lens epithelial cells and terminally differentiated fiber cells, we sought to determine the spatial localization of cells expressing ICSBP in the lens. Fig.2 shows ICSBP localization in embryonic day 17 TR and WT mouse eye sections using polyclonal antibodies specific to mouse ICSBP. In these experiments, three serial sections were fixed onto the same glass slide; one section served as a negative control and was incubated with normal preimmune serum, another section received the primary antibody, and the third section received the primary antibody and 10-fold excess of a neutralizing peptide specific to an immunogenic epitope of mouse ICSBP. In all six independent experiments performed, the experimental sections showed identical antibody-staining patterns, whereas the negative control section consistently showed no immunological reactivity. The section containing 10-fold molar excess of the peptide consistently showed no significant immunoreactivity. In some experiments the amount of the peptide was varied, and the neutralizing effect of the blocking peptide was found to be dose-dependent. As shown in Fig. 2, ICSBP protein is present in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of lens cells. In the TR mouse lens, intense nuclear localization of ICSBP is observed in cells at the lens equator (Fig. 2, C and D) and anterior epithelia (Fig. 2 F) but not in nuclei of the cells at the lens fiber compartment (white arrows in Fig. 2, Dand F). In the WT lens, the amount of ICSBP in the nucleus is very low and not easily detectable. However, cytoplasmic ICSBP is easily detectable, and the level in the lens epithelia appears to be higher compared with that of the fiber compartment (arrowhead in Fig. 2 E). We obtained similar results using eye sections of mice at days 16–20 of embryonic development (data not shown). As indicated by our immunolocalization studies, a significant amount of ICSBP expression occurs in the WT lens epithelia, and there is selective accumulation of the ICSBP protein in the nuclei of epithelial cells of the TR mouse lens. To confirm these results we examined well characterized lens epithelial cell lines for ICSBP expression. Three lens cell lines, αTN4–1, CRLE2, and 1AMLE6 were therefore treated with mouse IFNγ in either the presence or absence of CHX and analyzed for constitutive or inducible expression of ICSBP. RNA was isolated from the various treatment groups and used for Northern analyses. In each of the cell lines, two ICSBP mRNAs of 3.0 and 1.7 kilobases are detected (Fig.3 A), and their sizes are similar to those of mouse ICSBP transcripts in hematopoietic cells (15Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Mak W.-H. Marks M.S. Levi B.-Z. Flanagan J.R. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3743-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar,25Kanno Y. Kozak C.A. Schindler C. Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 3: 3951-3963Crossref Google Scholar). In cells treated with IFNγ, a significant increase in ICSBP is observed, indicating activation of the gene by IFNγ. Treatment with CHX prior to addition of IFNγ had no effects on the level of ICSBP transcripts, suggesting that inducible transcription of lens ICSBP mRNAs does not require de novo protein synthesis. In addition, cells that were treated for 2 h with IFNγ and untreated cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and analyzed for the presence of the ICSBP protein by Western blotting. As indicated in Fig. 3 B, the ICSBP protein is detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, the ICSBP present in the nucleus migrates faster on SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and appears to be of a lower apparent molecular weight. Cells that were not treated with IFNγ were found to contain more ICSBP in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. After treatment with IFNγ, both higher and lower molecular weight ICSBP species are detected in the cytoplasm. However, the lower molecular weight species present in the nucleus is significantly increased. As shown in Fig.3 B, the ICSBP species detected in the lens cell nucleus co-migrates on SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the ICSBP of mouse lymphoid cells. Consistent with previous reports (27Politis A.D. Ozato K. Coligan J.E. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2270-2278PubMed Google Scholar), neither mouse spleen cells nor the lymphoma cell line EL4 contain ICSBP in the cytoplasm. Transcriptional activation of the ICSBP gene by IFNγ is mediated by the binding of activated STAT1 homodimers in the nucleus to the conserved cis regulatory palindromic IFNγ-responsive GAS element, pIRE/GAS, present in the ICSBP gene at positions −147 to −175 (25Kanno Y. Kozak C.A. Schindler C. Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 3: 3951-3963Crossref Google Scholar). We therefore tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assay whether endogenous lens nuclear factors are able to bind pIRE/GAS. Analysis performed using nuclear extracts derived from WT mouse lens is shown in Fig.4 A. Two prominent DNA-protein complexes are formed with the pIRE/GAS probe, and formation of the complexes is competed by the unlabeled probe (Fig. 4 A,lane 3), indicating that the interaction is specific. A DNA element located in the ICSBP gene at positions −191 to −217 and 22 base pairs upstream from the mouse pIRE/GAS site (25Kanno Y. Kozak C.A. Schindler C. Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 3: 3951-3963Crossref Google Scholar) contains a minimum ISRE motif (GAAANN) resembling the IRE or Pu box. This sequence, referred to as ICSBP-IRE (25Kanno Y. Kozak C.A. Schindler C. Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 3: 3951-3963Crossref Google Scholar), was used as a competitor to further characterize the ICSBP/GAS binding activities in the lens. The ICSBP-IRE probe allowed us to detect lens factors that bind to other DNA elements in the ICSBP promoter besides its GAS site. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the IRE probe competed for the complex labeledb but not with the a complex (lane 4), indicating that there are factors in the lens that constitutively interact with GAS, as well as, non-GAS elements of the ICSBP promoter. To further characterize the interaction between the ICSBP/pIRE and ICSBP-IRE elements with lens nuclear factors, we analyzed nuclear extracts derived from the various lens cell lines before and after treatment with IFNγ. Typical results obtained from these studies are shown in Fig. 4 B. Either probe formed a common complex (d) that is competed away by a 100-fold excess of either probe. Similar to results obtained using lens nuclear extracts, formation of this complex is also observed in extracts from cells that were not treated with IFNγ (lanes 2 and 6), confirming that lens nuclear factors constitutively bind to these elements. An additional retarded band (c) was detected with the pIRE/GAS probe after treatment of the cells with IFNγ (Fig.4 B, compare lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that these DNA binding activities are"

The prototypical enzyme studied for this pathway is endonuclease V from the bacteriophage T4 (T4 bacteriophage pyrimidine dimer glycosylase (T4-pdg)). The first homologue for T4-pdg has been found in a strain of Chlorella virus (strainParamecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1), which contains a gene that predicts an amino acid sequence homology of 41% with T4-pdg. Because both the structure and critical catalytic residues are known for T4-pdg, homology modeling of the Chlorellavirus pyrimidine dimer glycosylase (cv-pdg) predicted that a conserved glutamic acid residue (Glu-23) would be important for catalysis at pyrimidine dimers and abasic sites. Site-directed mutations were constructed at Glu-23 to assess the necessity of a negatively charged residue at that position (Gln-23) and the importance of the length of the negatively charged side chain (Asp-23). E23Q lost glycosylase activity completely but retained low levels of AP lyase activity. In contrast, E23D retained near wild type glycosylase and AP lyase activities on cis-syn dimers but completely lost its activity on the trans-syn II dimer, which is very efficiently cleaved by the wild type cv-pdg. As has been shown for other glyscosylases, the wild type cv-pdg catalyzes the cleavage at dimers or AP sites via formation of an imino intermediate, as evidenced by the ability of the enzyme to be covalently trapped on substrate DNA when the reactions are carried out in the presence of a strong reducing agent; in contrast, E23D was very poorly trapped on cis-syndimers but was readily trapped on DNA containing AP sites. It is proposed that Glu-23 protonates the sugar ring, so that the imino intermediate can be formed.

One mechanism for the repair of the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer is the base excision repair pathway, which is initiated by a DNA glycosylase/abasic (AP)1lyase. Although many DNA-containing viruses that have sustained UV-induced DNA damage, use host cell enzymes to repair their DNA, the bacteriophage T4 is unusual in that it encodes an enzyme, endonuclease V (T4-pdg, pyrimidine dimer glycosylase), that cleaves the N-glycosyl bond of the 5′ thymine of the dimer and then subsequently cleaves the phosphodiester backbone, producing a ring opened sugar as an α, β unsaturated aldehyde (2Kim J.

T4-pdg has been characterized extensively since its discovery over 40 years ago, and its structure and mechanism of catalysis have been recently reviewed (5Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 1998; 408: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6Lloyd R.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The first eukaryotic homologue of T4-pdg has been found to be encoded within the genome of an algal virus, Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1. As a prelude to investigating structure-function relationships in Chlorella virus pyrimidine dimer glycosylase (cv-pdg), it is advantageous to utilize molecular modeling tools to direct biochemical analyses. However, in order to justify molecular modeling studies of a protein of which the structure has not been determined by x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, it is essential that the reference enzyme (T4-pdg): 1) be highly homologous to the protein of interest (cv-pdg), 2) has had its crystal structure solved as both the apoenzyme and as a complex with substrate containing DNA, 3) has had the critical active site residues established, and 4) recognize the same substrate and catalyze a similar reaction mechanism. In this study, T4-pdg is ideally characterized to serve as a homologous reference map for the study of cv-pdg, for the following reasons. First, the gene encoding cv-pdg predicts a protein that has a 41% identity with T4-pdg (7Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E.

Third, two key residues have been identified in T4-pdg to catalyze the combined glycosylase/AP lyase activity, in which the α-amino group of Thr-2 and Glu-23 act in concert to catalyze the nucleophilic displacement reaction (11Schrock III, R.D.

Fourth, as originally hypothesized for T4-pdg, cv-pdg has been hypothesized to initiate repair by protonation on the damaged base followed by glycosidic bond destabilization.

Additionally, the initial characterization of the properties of cv-pdg revealed that despite its high degree of sequence similarity with T4-pdg, there were significant differences in the activities on different isomers of the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (23McCullough A.K. Romberg M.T. Nyaga S. Wei Y. Wood T.G. Taylor J.S. Van Etten J.L. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13136-13142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast to T4-pdg, cv-pdg was able to efficiently cleave thetrans-syn II photoisomer, possibly suggesting a subtly different active site or binding pocket. Thus, with all of these available data, modeling studies and electrostatic potential mapping have been carried out to predict the structural similarities between T4-pdg and cv-pdg (23McCullough A.K. Romberg M.T. Nyaga S. Wei Y. Wood T.G. Taylor J.S. Van Etten J.L. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13136-13142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the catalytic mechanism of cv-pdg by using homology modeling to design site-directed mutations to test the role of Glu-23 in both the glycosylase and AP lyase reactions on thymine dimers and AP sites. The cv-pdg gene (A50L) was PCR-amplified from the pUC19 vector (7Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E. Landstein D. Lane L. Van Etten J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate an NdeI site on the 5′-end and aHindIII site on the 3′ side. The PCR primers were 5′-CATATGACACGTGTGAATCTCGTACCGG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTAATTATTGCTGGTTTTAGCTTTCGTG-3′. This fragment was subcloned into the pET-lla vector (Stratagene) by the NIEHS Molecular Biology Core at the University of Texas Medical Branch under the supervision of Dr. Thomas G. Wood. PCR conditions can be obtained upon request. The amino acid sequence of T4-pdg was aligned with the predicted amino acid sequence of the cv-pdg protein using the Look computer modeling package SegMod (Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA). The SegMod algorithm can be briefly described as follows. The cv-pdg sequence was divided into short segments, and these segments were matched to fragments in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank structural data base. The fragments were combined into a framework based on a template structure, in this case, the known structure of T4-pdg (10Morikawa K. Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Matsumoto O. Katayanagi K. Ohtsuka E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 360-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Multiple structures of the model were built and averaged into a final structure, which was then stereochemically refined using 500 rounds of energy minimization. The RMS deviation of backbone atoms relative to the T4-pdg structure was 1.6 Å. The coordinates of the modeled cv-pdg structure were used to calculate a relative electrostatic potential map using GRASP (24Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar). The GRASP Poisson-Boltzmann calculation used the following parameters: interior dielectric constant, 2.0; exterior dielectric constant, 80; water probe radius, 2.0; and salt concentration, 0.0. The relative potential values were mapped onto the Connolly surface of the model. The same procedure was followed with the T4-pdg structure for comparison with the modeled cv-pdg protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on the pET-11a vector containing the cv-pdg gene using the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the primers used to carry out the mutagenesis of the cv-pdg gene were as follows: 5′-GCTTCGGAATCATCTTAAGGTCACGAAATTCTGCCATGAG-3′ (E23D cv-pdg), 5′-CTCATGGCAGAATTTCGTGACCTTAAGATGATTCCGAAGGC-3′ (E23D cv-pdg), 5′-CTTCGGAATCATCTTAAGTTGACGAAATTCTGCCATGAGAT-3′(E23Q cv-pdg), and 5′-ATCTCATGGCAGAATTTCGTCAACTTAAGATGATTCCGAAG-3′ (E23Q cv-pdg), where the mismatched nucleotides are underlined. PCR conditions are available upon request. Following the PCRs, the templates were digested with DpnI, and the PCR product was visualized following separation on a 0.8% agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide. An aliquot of the PCR (4 μl) was used for transformation into Supercompetent XL1 Blue bacterial cells (Stratagene). After 1 h at 0 °C, the transformation reaction was heat-shocked for 1 min at 42 °C. The cells were allowed to recover for 1 h at 37 °C in 2X-YT medium (pH 7.0) (16 g of bacto-tryptone, 10 g of bacto-yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl per liter of deionized water). Cells were then plated out on LB plates that contained 100 μg/ml ampicillin (amp). Plasmid preparations were prepared from amp resistant colonies and analyzed by automated sequencing (NIEHS Molecular Biology Core Facility) to confirm each mutation. The purification scheme for the mutant enzymes differed slightly from that previously described for the wild type enzyme (7Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E. Landstein D. Lane L. Van Etten J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After sequencing each mutated gene to ensure that the only mutation generated was the mutation of interest, the plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21DE3, which is used for expression from this plasmid. This cell is a DE3 lysogen in which the gene for the T7 RNA polymerase has been inserted in the λ int gene, such that the lysogen remains stable. The T7 RNA polymerase gene is induced by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cultures (2 liters) were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml amp at 30 °C for 6 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C and resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.6m sucrose). The cells were broken using a French press at a constant pressure of 9000 p.s.i. The lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were loaded onto two 60-ml tandem Q-Sepharose-SP-Sepharose columns that had been previously equilibrated with Buffer B (25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl). The mutant cv-pdg proteins flowed through the Q-Sepharose but bound to the SP-Sepharose matrix and were eluted with a linear gradient of Buffer B from 0.1 m to 1.0 mNaCl (200 ml total volume). Fractions were collected and monitored by Western blot analysis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining of 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. The fractions that contained the mutant cv-pdg proteins were pooled, dialyzed, and loaded onto a 25-ml single-stranded DNA cellulose column that had been equilibrated with Buffer B. A linear gradient was run over the column of Buffer B from 0.1 m to 1.0 m NaCl (150 ml total volume). Several fractions appeared to contain pure cv-pdg by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and were subsequently analyzed via silver staining. E. coli strain AB2480 (uvrA,recA −) containing the pET-11a vector with either wild type cv-pdg, E23D cv-pdg, or E23Q cv-pdg was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml amp. Aliquots of these cultures were streaked onto an LB agar plate that also contained 100 μg/ml amp. The liquid bacterial medium was allowed to dry, and areas on the plate were irradiated with 254-nm light at 1.0 μW/cm2 for increasing amounts of time. Following irradiation, the plates were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 12 h. The cis-syn49-mer, trans-syn II 49-mer, reduced AP 49-mer, pyrrolidine (P) 25-mer (5′-GGATAGTGTCCAPGTTACTCGAAGC-3′), and tetrahydrofuran (F) 25-mer (5′-GGATAGTGTCCAFGTTACTCGAAGC-3′) were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to the appropriate complementary oligonucleotide with an adenine opposite the damaged nucleotide. The reduced AP 49-mer was generated by the same method as the AP 49-mer substrate except that subsequent to treatment with UDG, the DNA was treated with 100 mm NaBH4 for 10 min at 25 °C. Binding of the E23D cv-pdg or E23Q cv-pdg was assessed by gel mobility shift analysis. The reactions were conducted in a 20-μl total volume with the appropriate dilutions of the enzymes, and 20 pm substrate DNA duplexes in 25 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and a 1000-fold weight excess of poly dI:dC over the specific target DNA duplex. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by the addition of a one-half volume of loading buffer (50% glycerol and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue). The free DNA was separated from the enzyme-bound DNA duplex by electrophoresis through an 8% native polyacrylamide gel in 45 mm Tris borate (pH 7.5) 1 mm EDTA for 3 h at 120 V. Free DNA and enzyme-bound DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography of the wet gels using Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) x-ray film. The binding data was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Sunnyvale, CA). The data were plotted and fit to a hyperbolic curve function using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The K Dvalues were determined to be the enzyme concentration at which 50% of the substrate was shifted. Oligonucleotides (49-mers) containing either a site-specific cis-syn, trans-syn I, or trans-syn II thymine dimer were provided generously by Colin Smith and John-Stephen Taylor (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) with the sequence 5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAATTAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT3′ (23McCullough A.K. Romberg M.T. Nyaga S. Wei Y. Wood T.G. Taylor J.S. Van Etten J.L. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

These DNAs were 32P-labeled on the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to an unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide. The double stranded thymine dimer-containing 49-mer was diluted with reaction buffer (25 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), and the appropriate concentrations of the T4-pdg, cv-pdg, E23D cv-pdg, or E23Q cv-pdg were added to the reactions for 30 min at 37 °C. Incision reactions were terminated by the addition of the loading buffer (95% (v/v) formamide, 20 mmEDTA, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The reactions were subsequently treated with 1 m piperidine and heated to boiling for 10 min. The purpose of the piperidine treatment was to convert any abasic sites into single strand breaks. The substrate DNAs were separated from the incision product DNAs by electrophoresis through a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The DNA bands were visualized by autoradiography of the wet gels using Hyperfilm-MP x-ray film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 49-mer oligonucleotide containing a site-specific uracil was synthesized (Midland Research) with the sequence 5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAAUTAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT-3′. The underlining shows the position of the uracil. This uracil-containing 49-mer was 32P-labeled on the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to its complementary oligonucleotide. The double stranded uracil-containing 49-mer was incubated with uracil DNA glycosylase (Epicentre Technologies) for 10 min at 37 °C, generating an AP site. This oligonucleotide was then diluted with reaction buffer (25 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), and the appropriate concentrations of the T4-pdg, cv-pdg, E23D cv-pdg, or E23Q cv-pdg were added to the AP-containing DNA (30 min at 37 °C). The reactions were analyzed as described above. Oligonucleotides containing either acis-syn thymine dimer or the abasic site were diluted to obtain a final substrate concentration of 0.5 nm in the reaction buffer described above. Reactions were initiated by the simultaneous addition of 100 mm NaBH4 or 100 mm NaCl with 115 nm T4-pdg, cv-pdg, E23D cv-pdg, or E23Q cv-pdg. In control experiments, the substrates were preincubated with 100 mm NaBH4 or 100 mm NaCl for 5 min prior to addition of the enzymes. All reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated as described above, and the trapped complexes were separated from free DNAs by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide 8m urea denaturing gel. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on the pET-11a vector containing the cv-pdg gene using the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce a codon change at Glu-23 to create either a glutamine (E23Q) or an aspartic acid (E23D). The cv-pdg genes were completely sequenced to verify the identity at each nucleotide. These DNAs were transformed into E. coli BL21DE3 for expression. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purity of the protein preparations was assessed by silver staining of a 15% polyacrylamide gel. E23Q cv-pdg (Fig.1, lane 1), E23D cv-pdg (lane 2), and wild type cv-pdg (lane 3) were visible without any discernable contaminants. The ability of cv-pdg and the E23D and E23Q mutants to enhance the survival of an E. coli strain that is recombination and nucleotide excision repair-deficient (uvrA −, recA−) was determined by challenge with increasing doses of UV irradiation (Fig.2). Plasmids containing the wild type and mutant cv-pdg genes were transformed into E. coliAB2480. Overnight cultures of these cells were streaked onto an agar plate and either completely shielded from UV irradiation (Fig. 2,lanes 1–4) or irradiated (lanes 5–8) for increasing times. Cells that expressed cv-pdg (lane 5) exhibited increased survival, whereas cells expressing the two mutants, E23D and E23Q (lanes 6 and 7, respectively), had survivals that were indistinguishable from cells that contained the pET11a vector alone (lane 8). These results demonstrate that cv-pdg led to increased survival of UV challenged bacteria, whereas the bacteria expressing cv-pdg mutants at Glu-23 resulted in no increased survival following UV challenge. A possible explanation for the decreased UV survival of cells expressing mutant forms of cv-pdg was that these mutations altered pyrimidine dimer-specific binding. In order to estimate relative binding affinities, dissociation constants were determined for wild type and mutant enzyme on noncleavable substrate analogues. For these determinations, gel mobility shift analyses were chosen because this assay represents the standard method that is used to estimate K D values for other glycosylase/AP lyases in the base excision repair pathway,i.e. endonuclease VIII (26Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32230-32239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), Fpg (27Castaing B. Boiteux S. Zelwer C.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11140-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For these assays, it was necessary to use substrates that are not catalytic substrates for these enzymes. Although previously it had been demonstrated that T4-pdg and cv-pdg could not incise DNAs containing reduced AP sites, tetrahydrofuran residues, or pyrrolidine sites (23McCullough A.K. Romberg M.T. Nyaga S. Wei Y. Wood T.G. Taylor J.S. Van Etten J.L. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13136-13142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28McCullough A.K.

The data in Fig.3 show no activity for the enzyme preparations on any of these three substrates. Gel shift analyses were performed to determine the relative dissociation constants for the wild type and mutant enzymes on noncleaveable substrates (Table I). Labeled DNAs were incubated with increasing concentrations of enzymes for 30 min at 25 °C and analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The wild type cv-pdg showed comparable dissociation constants to those determined for the E23D cv-pdg mutant on all of its noncleavable DNA substrates. These data strongly suggest that the decreased UV survival cannot be attributed to a loss of specific DNA binding. However, the E23Q cv-pdg mutant was found to have a reduced binding of 20–100-fold on all the substrates tested. These data indicate that reduced affinity for specific substrates may significantly contribute to reduced UV survival. In comparison, the T4-pdg mutant E23Q did not exhibit significant loss in binding to these noncleavable substrates, suggesting significant differences in the details of the damage recognition site.Table IDissociation constant determinationcv-pdgcv-pdg E23Dcv-pdg E23QT4-pdgaThe dissociation constants for the wild type and mutant T4-pdg enzymes were determined by McCullough et al.(18).T4-pdgaThe dissociation constants for the wild type and mutant T4-pdg enzymes were determined by McCullough et al.(18).

Open table in a new tab To characterize the dimer substrate specificity, in vitro incision assays were used to determine the relative nicking activity of the wild type and mutant cv-pdg enzymes on separate DNAs, each containing one of the three isomers of the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, cis-syn, trans-syn I, or trans-syn II. Seven concentrations of T4-pdg, cv-pdg, and E23D cv-pdg were assessed for activity on the cis-syn thymine dimer 49-mer (Fig.4). To monitor every glycosylase event and not only the combined glycosylase and concomitant AP lyase activities, the reactions were treated with piperidine prior to electrophoretic separation of substrates and nicked products. The relative activity between these proteins can be compared by the enzyme concentration that converted 50% of a 0.5 nm substrate into product in 30 min. These activity comparisons were made relative to the activity of the wild type cv-pdg on the cis-syn49-mer (Table II). Wild type cv-pdg had a relative activity of 0.09 nm, T4-pdg was 0.19 nm, and E23D cv-pdg was 0.60 nm. Additionally, when these experiments were carried out without the final piperidine treatment, no decrease in the amount of product DNA generated was detected, suggesting that all the glycosylase activity was followed by a concomitant AP lyase activity (data not shown). E23Q cv-pdg was found to have no detectable activity on the cis-syn 49-mer, even when the reaction time was increased from 30 min to 6 h (data not shown). Consistent with this finding, the binding affinity of E23Q for DNA containing a cis-syn dimer was very weak (400 nm.) (Table I), a value approaching the affinity for undamaged DNA.Table IISpecific activity of T4-pdg, cv-pdg, and cv-pdg mutantsT4-pdgcv-pdgE23D cv-pdgE23Q cv-pdgnmCS 49-mer0.190.090.60NAaNA, no detectable activity.TSI 49-merNANANANATSII 49-mer6.01.5NANAAP 49-mer0.150.170.18>115RAP 49-merNANANANAPyr 25-merNANANANATHF 25-merNANANANAa NA, no detectable activity.

https://openalex.org/W2053700471,"Hemin is a catalyst of the formation of reactive oxygen species. We proposed that hematophagous insects are exposed to intense oxidative stress because of hemoglobin hydrolysis in their midgut (Petretsky, M. D., Ribeiro, J. M. C., Atella, G. C., Masuda, H., and Oliveira, P. L. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 10893–10896). We have shown that hemin stimulates urate synthesis in the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus (Graca-Souza, A. V., Petretsky, J. H., Demasi, M., Bechara, E. J. H., and Oliveira, P. L. (1997) Free Radical Biol. Med. 22, 209–214). Once released by fat body cells, urate accumulates in the hemolymph, where this radical scavenger constitutes an important defense against blood-feeding derived oxidative stress. Incubation of Rhodnius fat bodies with okadaic acid raises the level of urate synthesis, suggesting that urate production can be controlled by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Urate synthesis is stimulated by dibutyryl cAMP and inhibited byN(2((p-bromocinnamil)amino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89), an inhibitor of protein kinase A, as well as activated by the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. In the presence of hemin, however, inhibition of urate synthesis by H-89 does not occur, suggesting that the hemin stimulatory effect is not mediated by protein kinase A. Calphostin C completely inhibits the hemin-induced urate production, suggesting that the triggering of urate antioxidant response depends on protein kinase C activation. This conclusion is reinforced by the observation that in fat bodies exposed to hemin, both protein kinase C activity and phosphorylation of specific endogenous polypeptides are significantly increased."

Therefore, Piv may mediate site-specific recombination by a novel mechanism. To begin to determine how Piv may assemble a synaptic nucleoprotein structure for DNA cleavage and strand exchange, we have characterized the interaction of Piv with the DNA inversion region ofM. lacunata. Gel shift and nuclease/chemical protection assays, competition and dissociation rate analyses, and cooperativity studies indicate that Piv binds two distinct recognition sequences. One recognition sequence, found at multiple sites within and outside of the invertible segment, is bound by Piv protomers with high affinity. The second recognition sequence is located at the recombination cross-over sites at the ends of the invertible element; Piv interacts with this sequence as an oligomer with apparent low affinity.

Site-specific recombination, mediated by the recombinases of the λ-integrase and Hin/resolvase families, involves a two-step transesterification reaction in which the intermediate is a covalent recombinase-DNA linkage. This covalent attachment is the result of nucleophilic attack on the DNA phosphodiester backbone by a hydroxyl group of the conserved serine (Hin/resolvase), or tyrosine (λ-integrase), of the recombinase. In the second transesterification reaction, the phosphodiester linkages of the exchanged DNA strands are restored (reviewed in Refs. 2Hallet B. Sherratt D.J.

In contrast, DNA transposition, mediated by transposases containing the catalytic DDE amino acid motif, utilizes a hydrolysis reaction for cleavage at the ends of the transposable element. This first cleavage leaves 3′-OH ends to act directly as the attacking nucleophile in a one-step trans-esterification reaction resulting in strand exchange. Resolution of the transposition process involves DNA replication or DNA repair activity to fill in gaps left at the target site due to the staggered cut mediated by the transposase and the 3′ hydroxyl groups at the element ends (reviewed in Refs. 1Craig N.L.

These features of the recombination reactions mediated by site-specific recombinases and transposases suggest that a group of related recombinases would not mediate both site-specific recombination and transposition. Therefore, it is surprising that the site-specific recombinase Piv, which directs site-specific DNA inversion inMoraxella lacunata and Moraxella bovis, exhibits significant homology to the transposases of the IS110/IS492 family of IS elements (approximately 25–35% amino acid identity and 45–55% similarity, 5). Furthermore, Piv and the IS110/IS492 transposases do not appear to be related to the site-specific recombinases of the λ-Int or Hin/resolvase families or the transposases containing the DDE motif (4Mahillon J. Chandler M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 725-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Piv and the IS110/IS492transposases may define a new family of DNA recombinases. The homology between Piv and the IS110/IS492transposases includes several highly conserved amino acid regions (5Lenich A.G. Glasgow A.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4160-4164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which, based on mutational analyses, contain functionally relevant amino acid motifs. 1D. Tobiason, A. Lenich, and A. C. Glasgow, submitted for publication. Although there is no completely conserved DNA sequence among all the IS elements and the Piv invertible DNA segment, there is a consensus sequence for the ends of a subgroup of the IS elements, which is also found overlapping the recombination sites of the Piv invertible element.1 To determine if indeed Piv and the IS110/IS492 transposases define a new family of DNA recombinases that utilize a common mechanism for both site-specific recombination and transposition, we must characterize the recombination reactions mediated by Piv and transposases from the IS110/IS492 family. As a first step in understanding the mechanism for Piv-mediated assembly of a synaptic nucleoprotein complex, DNA cleavage, and strand exchange, we have characterized the interactions of Piv with the invertible DNA segment of Moraxella lacunata. DNase I was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corp. Amylose resin, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Klenow (exo−), and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs (NEB). Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene. The His tag XPRESS purification system and the TA cloning kit were purchased from Invitrogen. Radionucleotides were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Isopropyl-1-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG),2 dithiothreitol, and EDTA were purchased from Sigma. Dimethyl sulfate was purchased from Aldrich. The pAG607 plasmid is composed of the pMal-C2 vector (NEB) containing the piv gene inserted into theXmnI and BamHI sites such that it is in frame directly downstream of a factor Xa protease site in themalE gene. The piv gene was obtained by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the pMxL1 plasmid, subclone ofM. lacunata inversion region provided by C. Marrs (6Marrs C.F. Rozsa F.W. Hackel M. Stevens S.P. Glasgow A.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4370-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), usingPfu DNA polymerase and the primers: 5′-GCCAGCACGTGTCTAAAACTTACATTG-3′ and 5′-CCTAAGCTTCTAGGATACCAATAAAT-3′. Similarly, the piv gene from pMxL1 was PCR-amplified with the primers: 5′-CTCGTCTCGAGTTCATGAATGCGTTTGTCAAAAG-3′ and 5′-CAGTTCACATATGTCTAAAACTTACATTGGGATT-3′, cleaved withXhoI and NdeI, and inserted into the same restriction sites in pET21a (Novagen). This placed piv in frame with a COOH-terminal His6 tag sequence, creating the Piv-His6 expression vector, pAG1300. A 245-bp fragment was generated from the pMxL1-dl24 plasmid (6Marrs C.F. Rozsa F.W. Hackel M. Stevens S.P. Glasgow A.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4370-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) usingPfu DNA polymerase and the primers 5′-CATAGGATCCAAAATTACCTGCCAGACATC-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCGCTAACCTTACACTCATAC-3′. This 245-bp fragment, containing the strong upstream binding site (sub1), was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids, pAG604 and pAG605, contain sub1 in opposite orientations. The inserted DNA was sequenced (T7 Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to check for any mutations due to the PCR reaction. To construct the DNA inversion test plasmid pAG862, a 5865-bp DNA fragment containing the invertible segment was obtained by partial digestion of pMxL1 with EcoRI. This fragment was gel-purified and ligated into EcoRI-digested pACYC184 (NEB) creating the pAG850 plasmid. To inactivate piv, the Ω fragment encoding the SpcR/SmR genes was recombined into the piv gene of pAG850 by homologous recombination with piv::Ω on the pMxL5 plasmid (6Marrs C.F. Rozsa F.W. Hackel M. Stevens S.P. Glasgow A.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4370-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the Rec+ strain JM101 (NEB). The recombinant plasmid, pAG862, was confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. To produce the Piv protein fused at its amino terminus to maltose-binding protein (MBP-Piv), DH5α containing pAG607 was grown in Luria broth to OD600 = 0.5, induced with 0.5 mm IPTG, aerated at 37 °C for 2 h, and lysed in a French pressure cell. Crude extract was immediately loaded onto an amylose column, washed with column buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), and then eluted with 10 mm maltose in column buffer (7di Guan C. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 8Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea A.G.d. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A. McReynolds L.A. Guan C.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected and frozen in 20% or 30% glycerol at −20 °C. Protein concentration was quantitated using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. To produce the His6-tagged Piv, pAG1300 was introduced into BL21(DE3) (Novagen), grown to mid-log phase in Luria broth, then induced with 1 mm IPTG. After 1 h aeration at 37 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, and lysed in a French pressure cell at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto an Invitrogen ProBond column (Ni2+ affinity column). Following washes with 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.8 buffer, protein was eluted with an imidazole step gradient (50, 200, 350, and 500 mm). Piv-His6 eluted at 300 mm imidazole. The protein was dialyzed into 20 mm phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, and 30% glycerol at 4 °C and stored at −20 °C. Antibody to the Piv protein was produced in rabbits injected with purified MBP-Piv protein (BAbCO; Berkeley Antibody Company). Nonspecific antibodies were removed from the rabbit sera by absorption to whole cells of DH5α cultures, followed by multiple passages over a Sepharose column bound withEscherichia coli proteins and MBP. This affinity column was made by lysing a culture of pMal-C2/DH5α that had been induced with 0.5 mm IPTG to express the MBP protein, then binding the proteins from this lysate to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose resin using the protocol of the resin manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluate was stored at 4 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using the protocol of Sambrook et al. (9$$Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was accomplished following the method of Ausubel et al. (10$$Google Scholar) with the following modifications; polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) was used for blotting, and the blot was probed with a 1:400 dilution of partially purified Piv antibody. The protein markers were SDS-PAGE standards, low range, or Kaleidoscope prestained standards (for Western blots) from Bio-Rad. DH5α containing pAG862, pAG862 and pAG607 or containing pAG862 and pMal-C2 were grown to OD600 = 0.6, induced with 0.05 mm IPTG, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Plasmids were extracted using an alkaline lysis protocol (9$$Google Scholar) and digested with HindIII and KpnI. The restriction digests were examined on a 0.8% SeaKem (FMC Bioproducts) agarose gel. The DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining and documented by digital imaging of the UV-illuminated gel. Double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides, INV and SUB (see “Results”), were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase following the protocols of Sambrook et al. (9$$Google Scholar). pAG604 and pAG605 were digested with SpeI andEcoRV to obtain 298-bp fragments containing thesub1 site to be used in DNase I protection assays. These fragments were labeled at the SpeI site with [α-32P]ATP using Klenow (exo−) DNA polymerase under conditions recommended by the manufacturer with the modification of incubating the reactions at 25 °C; the labeled fragments were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, electroeluted from the gel, and stored at −20 °C. The pMxL1-dL24 plasmid, a deletion derivative of pMxL1, provided by C. Marrs (6Marrs C.F. Rozsa F.W. Hackel M. Stevens S.P. Glasgow A.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4370-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the pMxL1invR fragment (obtained by PCR from pMxL1, usingPfu DNA polymerase and the primers: 5′-GCCAGCACGTGTCTAAAACTTACATTG and 5′-CCATACACCATCAGCAGCACG) were digested with various restriction enzymes as indicated under “Results.” The DNA fragments created were labeled with [α-32P]dATP or dCTP using Klenow (exo−) polymerase, gel-purified, and stored at −20 °C. Gel electrophoresis retardation, or gel shift, assays were initiated by mixing MBP-Piv protein with each radiolabeled DNA fragment (5 × 10−12m) in 1× binding buffer: 80 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 5 mmCaCl2, 250 mg/ml poly(C), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (NEB). The reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, immediately loaded onto a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and run at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE buffer. For the competition assays, increasing amounts of competitor DNA ranging from 1 to 500 molar excess was added to the reaction before addition of the protein. The specific DNA competitors were the SUB and INV double-stranded oligonucleotides and the nonspecific DNA competitor was a 39-bp oligonucleotide: 5′-TTAAGATCGATGACGTCAGATCTGAGCTCGATACTCGAG annealed to 5′-CTCGAGTATCGAGCTCAGATCTGACGTCATCGATC. For the DNase I protection assays performed at the sub1 site, the 298-bp fragments from pAG604 and pAG605, labeled on the top strand and bottom strand for sub1 (5 × 10−10m), were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with or without MBP-Piv (7 × 10−6m) in 1× binding buffer. DNase I protection assays were performed in binding buffer plus 5 mm MgCl2 with 0.02 units of DNase I as described previously (11Glasgow A.C. Bruist M.F. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10072-10082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical cleavage using the Maxam and Gilbert sequencing reactions A/G and C/T were performed with the same labeled fragments (12Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9012) Google Scholar). The footprinting and sequencing reactions were run on a 6% sequencing polyacrylamide gel. At the site of inversion, dimethyl sulfate interference assays were performed as described previously (16Koo H.S. Drak J. Rice J.A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4227-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Indirect DNase I and 1,10-phenanthroline-copper protection assays were also performed at the site of inversion following the protocol described by Kuwabara and Sigman (13Kuwabara M.D. Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7234-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with the following modifications for the DNase I protection assay: gel slices were treated with DNase I in 1× binding buffer plus 5 mm MgCl2 for 5–8 min before quenching the reaction with the addition of 20 mm EDTA. Gel electrophoresis retardation assays were performed with labeled DNA fragments (5 × 10−12m) and increasing amounts of MBP-Piv protein ranging from 0.6 to 1582 nm for binding to SUB and 0.6 to 4560 nm for binding to INV. Binding of MBP-Piv (P) to each DNA binding site (X) is represented by the equation:K = [P]n[X]/[Pn X], which translates into: ln([Pn X]/[X]) = nln[P] − ln[K]. [P] is the concentration of MBP-Piv monomers, [Pn] is the concentration of active MBP-Piv oligomers, n is the number of active monomers in the oligomer, [Pn X] is the concentration of bound DNA, and [X] is the concentration of unbound DNA. A plot of ln[P] versusln([Pn X]/[X]) gives a line with slope n (14Kristensen H.H. Valentin-Hansen P. Sogaard-Andersen L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The amount of bound and unbound DNA was quantitated using a PhosphorImager: 445SI with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Binding assays were performed in 1× binding buffer. Labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide (5 × 10−12m) was incubated with MBP-Piv protein (6 × 10−7m) as indicated for 20 min at room temperature. Unlabeled, competitor oligonucleotide (2.5 × 10−8m) was added at time zero. At the indicated times, 20-μl aliquots were loaded onto a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel running at 120 V. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and imaged with a PhosphorImager: 445SI. ImageQuant software was used to quantitate the label in the bands corresponding to MBP-Piv-DNA complexes and unbound DNA. The fraction of the total DNA in the reaction that was bound by MBP-Piv was calculated by dividing the amount of labeled DNA present in the shifted complexes by the total labeled DNA in the reaction (i.e. the combined complexed and unbound DNA fragments quantitated for each reaction). The percent bound DNA was plotted as a function of the time after addition of competitor DNA. The half-life for each complex was the time required for a 50% reduction in protein-DNA complex due to dissociation of the MBP-Piv DNA complex. Based on the sequence of the piv gene, the Piv protein is predicted to be a 322-amino acid polypeptide with aM r of 36,935 and an isoelectric point of 10.72. To facilitate purification of Piv, M. lacunata piv was introduced into the expression vector pMal-C2, fusing malEto the 5′ end of piv (pAG607) to produce the fusion protein, MBP-Piv. MBP-Piv (79 kDa) was soluble and expressed at high levels. Affinity chromatography (amylose resin) was used to purify the MBP-Piv fusion protein for use in DNA binding assays. Fig.1 A shows a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel containing samples from a crude lysate used for purification of MBP-Piv and fractions collected from the 10 mm maltose elution of protein bound to the amylose column. ImageQuant analysis of a digital image of a Coomassie-stained, SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing serial dilutions of the purified protein indicated that the fractions used in all the following experiments are approximately 85% full-length MBP-Piv protein (data not shown). Fig. 1 B shows Western blot analysis of expression of the MBP-Piv fusion protein from pAG607 using polyclonal antisera raised against MBP-Piv and affinity-purified to obtain anti-Piv antisera as described under “Experimental Procedures.” MBP-Piv could be detected in the soluble fraction of a crude lysate prepared from DH5α cells containing pAG607 after induction with 0.5 mm IPTG (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). The affinity-purified antibodies are specific for Piv as no cross-reactivity with MBP alone was observed (Fig. 1 B,lane 2). Cleavage of MBP-Piv with the protease factor Xa, which recognizes a specific cleavage site between MBP and Piv in the fusion protein, resulted in cleavage at the fusion junction sequence and, unfortunately, also within Piv itself. Because this additional cleavage site prevented separation of the full-length Piv protein from MBP by Factor Xa treatment, we determined whether the MBP-Piv fusion protein could carry out the functions of wild type Piv. An in vivo inversion assay was used to qualitatively estimate recombinase activity as an indication of functional protein-DNA interactions (Fig. 2). DH5α was cotransformed with a DNA inversion test plasmid, pAG862, and expression plasmids encoding either MBP alone (pMal-C2), or MBP-Piv (pAG607). After overnight expression of MBP or MBP-Piv, recombination of the invertible segment on pAG862 was assayed by restriction enzyme digestion of isolated plasmid DNA. In the original orientation of the test plasmid, digestion with HindIII and KpnI results in two bands, of 5.7 and 1.0 kb. If there is MBP-Piv-mediated inversion, the same digestion will yield two different unique bands, of 4.1 and 2.6 kb. With MBP alone, no inversion products are seen, whereas, in the presence of MBP-Piv, approximately 50% of the test plasmid is in the inverted orientation (Fig. 2). In a similar inversion assay, wild type Piv also directed inversion to yield approximately 50% of either orientation, representing an equilibrium point in the inversion reaction (data not shown). Thus, these results indicated that the MBP-Piv fusion is a functional recombinase; consequently, the uncleaved MBP-Piv fusion protein was used in subsequent in vitro DNA binding studies. Based on the binding specificity of other site-specific recombinases and transposases (reviewed in Refs. 1Craig N.L. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1996: 2339-2362Google Scholar and 2Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. FEMS Microbiol Rev. 1997; 21: 157-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we expected that Piv would bind DNA sequences encoding the cross-over sites for inversion (invL and invR) as well as possible accessory sites involved in recombination or regulation ofpiv expression. An assay for Piv DNA binding sites within the inversion region was carried out using gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA; data not shown) with a series of restriction fragments that spanned both the invertible segment and the adjacent sequences required for inversion in E. coli (Fig.3 A). Several of the fragments were shifted in the presence of MBP-Piv (* in Fig. 3 A). Two fragments, 430 and 870 bp, were chosen for further analysis by DNase I footprinting. The 430-bp fragment was selected because it spans the left recombination site of the invertible element (invL). The 870-bp fragment also contains the invL recombination site, plus a potential accessory site (see below). DNase I protection assays with MBP-Piv and the 870-bp fragment showed protections and enhancements from about −285 to −265 bp upstream of the invL cross-over site (data not shown). However, due to the relatively large size of the fragment, the DNase I cleavage pattern at the site was not easily resolved. Therefore, a smaller fragment of 298 bp, containing the protected DNA sequence, was examined by DNase I protection assays (Fig. 3, B and C). The DNase I cleavage pattern in the MBP-Piv binding region has long tracts of no cleavage due to A-tract repeats that narrow the minor groove, thus inhibiting DNase I binding and cleavage (15Drew H.R. Travers A.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). These A-tracts are also appropriately phased along the DNA helix to contribute sequence-directed DNA bending to this region of the DNA (16.). Protections and enhancements from −233 to −247 and from −266 to −285 (Fig. 3, B and C) could be resolved in these DNase I protection assays. No other protected regions were detected on the 298-bp fragment. This MBP-Piv binding site is probably too distant from the site of DNA cleavage (+1) and strand exchange in the inversion reaction to be the binding site for the Piv subunit that actually catalyzes the recombination reaction. However, it is likely that this Piv binding site is an accessory site utilized in the assembly of an active synaptic complex for Piv-mediated DNA inversion (see “Discussion”). The 430-bp fragment (Fig. 3 A) contains the 26-bp site of inversion (invL) that was defined based upon sequence homology at the ends of the invertible segment (17Fulks K.A. Marrs C.F. Stevens S.P. Green M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 310-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial EMSA analysis of MBP-Piv binding to the 430-bp fragment indicated that MBP-Piv does bind specifically, albeit weakly, to a sequence within this fragment (data not shown). However, DNase I and 1,10-phenanthroline-copper protection assays with the 430-bp fragment and MBP-Piv showed no evidence of protein-DNA interactions (data not shown). Because MBP-Piv does shift the 430-bp fragment in EMSA gels, indirect DNase I protection assays were performed with the 430-bp fragment in which the electrophoretically separated protein-DNA complex and unbound DNA are treated with DNase I in the non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and then isolated from gel slices for electrophoresis on the DNA sequencing polyacrylamide gel (see “Materials and Methods”). Even though this assay should have enriched for DNA complexed with MBP-Piv, no protection of DNA sequence by MBP-Piv was observed. These results suggested that the binding of MBP-Piv to the 430-bp fragment was either unstable or not specific. To determine if the poor interactions of MBP-Piv with invLare due to the MBP protein at the amino terminus of Piv, Piv was tagged at the COOH terminus with six histidines (see “Materials and Methods”). The Piv-His6 fusion protein was partially purified and used in EMSA and DNase I protection assays with the 430-bp fragment and also with the 298-bp fragment containing the accessory Piv binding site (data not shown). All of the DNA binding results with Piv-His6 corresponded exactly with those obtained with MBP-Piv, indicating that the poor binding of MBP-Piv to invLis not due to steric hindrance by MBP of Piv-specific binding. Therefore, stable binding of Piv may require other factors such as accessory DNA binding sites, accessory proteins, and/or supercoiled DNA substrate to facilitate binding to the recombination sites (see “Discussion”). To characterize the interactions of MBP-Piv with the isolated invL and upstream accessory site, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to each site were synthesized (designated INV and SUB, respectively; Fig. 4 A). The sequence of INV included the 26-bp region of homology from either end of the invertible element and 14 bp of sequence immediately upstream and downstream from the invL site. The DNA sequence of SUB (orstrong upstream binding site oligonucleotide) was designed based on the DNase I footprint originally obtained with the 870-bp DNA fragment (i.e. the protected region −269 to −284, but not the −233 to −245 region). The INV and SUB DNA binding substrates were used in an EMSA to examine MBP-Piv binding at each site (Fig. 4 B). Two shifted complexes (S-1 and S-2,lane 2, Fig. 4 B) were formed with the SUB oligonucleotide, indicating that at least two MBP-Piv proteins bind SUB. Because the SUB oligonucleotide does not include the DNA sequence from −233 to −247 bp (see Fig. 3), we have designated the MBP-Piv binding site encoded within the SUB oligonucleotide,sub1. MBP-Piv binding to INV resulted in one primary complex (I-1) that migrated at approximately the same rate as the slower migrating complex formed with SUB (S-2). Because the difference in the molecular weights of the INV and SUB oligonucleotides is nominal in comparison to the MBP-Piv molecular weight, this result suggests that the I-1 and S-2 protein-DNA complexes contain the same number of MBP-Piv protomers. No faster migrating protein-DNA complex was seen with INV when the concentration of MBP-Piv was decreased (data not shown). The presence of a slower complex (I-2) was detected with some variability in the EMSAs. The formation of this complex suggests that a higher multimeric MBP-Piv may bind INV or an additional INV oligonucleotide may bind the I-1 complex. Based upon the predicted molecular weights of INV, SUB, and MBP-Piv, the electrophoretic mobilities of I-1, S-1, and S-2 indicate that INV is bound by at least two MBP-Piv protomers while SUB is bound by either single (S-1) or multiple (S-2) MBP-Piv protomers. Comparison of the Piv DNA binding substrates, INV and SUB, revealed very little homology (TATNC), suggesting that Piv has two different DNA recognition sites. To further examine the interactions of MBP-Piv with the apparently different binding sites on INV and SUB, competition assays were performed using each of the oligonucleotides as both binding substrate and competitor DNA. In Fig. 5 A, the SUB oligonucleotide was labeled and used in DNA binding assays with MB"

Its expression is strongly induced in migrating and proliferating keratinocytes during wound healing and, on the other hand, diminished or lost in invasive squamous cell carcinoma. We have recently found in the syndecan-1 gene an enhancer (fibroblast growth factor-inducible response element (FiRE)) that activates gene expression in wound edge keratinocytes (Jaakkola, P., Kontusaari, S., Kauppi, T., Määttä, A., and Jalkanen, M. (1998)FASEB J. 12, 959–969). Now, we demonstrate that the activation of this enhancer by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is modulated by the components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). MCA-3D mouse immortal keratinocytes growing on fibrillar collagen failed to activate FiRE and subsequently to induce syndecan-1 in response to KGF. The same cells growing on fibronectin or laminin, however, increased FiRE-dependent reporter gene expression upon KGF treatment. The inhibition of the KGF induction by collagen appears to be specific for signaling to FiRE, as the increase in cell proliferation by KGF was not affected. The effect was selective to KGF, as EGF-induction was independent on ECM composition. Changes in the transcription factor binding were not involved in the differential activation of FiRE, as the levels and composition of the AP-1 complexes were unchanged. However, application of anisomycin, an activator of Jun amino-terminal kinase, resulted in a lower response in cells growing on collagen compared with fibronectin. These results indicate that the composition of ECM and availability of growth factors can play a role in the epidermal regulation of syndecan-1 expression and that FiRE is a novel target for gene regulation by the extracellular matrix.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) is strongly augmented by the presence of cell surface heparan sulfate (3Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 4Yayon A. Klagsburn M. Esko J. Leder P. Ornitz D. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). This is possibly related to findings that mutations in the members of glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans lead to delayed progression of cell cycle in Drosophila (6Nakato H. Futch T.A. Selleck S.B. Development. 1995; 121: 3687-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and to an overgrowth syndrome in man (7Pilia G. Hughes-Benzie R.M. MacKenzie A. Baybayan P. Chen E.Y. Huber R. Neri G. Cao A. Forabosco A. Schlessinger D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Finally, the enzymatic activity of proteases present in acute wound fluids is regulated by heparan sulfate (8Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 is an integral membrane proteoglycan that bears both heparan and chondroitin sulfate side chains. In adult tissues, it is almost exclusively found in simple and stratified epithelia. In simple epithelia, it has been proposed to participate in the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype (9Leppä S. Mali M. Miettinen H. Jalkanen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Kato M. Saunder S. Nguen H. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 559-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the epidermis, syndecan-1 expression is strongest in the suprabasal cell layers although undetectable in the cornified layer (11Hayashi K. Hayashi M. Jalkanen M. Firestone J.H. Trelstad R.L. Bernfield M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In cultured keratinocytes, syndecan-1 mRNA levels increase upon differentiation of the cells by exposure to high Ca2+ concentrations (12Inki P. Larjava H. Haapasalmi K. Miettinen H.M. Grenman R. Jalkanen M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 43-51Google Scholar). Additional regulation takes place at the posttranslational level: the glycosaminoglycan chains of syndecan-1 are longer in stratified than in undifferentiated keratinocytes (13Sanderson R. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9562-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Remarkably, both syndecan-1 protein and mRNA levels are strongly induced in the wound edge keratinocytes during wound healing (14Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This elevated expression in keratinocytes appears to be specific for syndecan-1, as no changes have been detected for the other syndecans, although a strong induction of syndecan-4 occurs in the dermis (15Gallo R. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The opposite situation is found during the malignant transformation of keratinocytes. Syndecan-1 is lost in invasive carcinomas and reduced in poorly differentiated epidermal dysplasias (12Inki P. Larjava H. Haapasalmi K. Miettinen H.M. Grenman R. Jalkanen M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 43-51Google Scholar, 16Inki P. Stenbäck F. Talve L. Jalkanen M. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 1333-1340PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, syndecan-1 levels are very low in a cell line derived from a carcinoma induced by chemical carcinogenesis but normal in epithelial cells, such as immortal MCA-3D keratinocytes (17Inki P. Kujari H. Jalkanen M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 314-323PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to understand both the induction of syndecan-1 during development and repair processes and, on the other hand, the suppression of its expression in malignancies, we have cloned the syndecan-1 gene (18Vihinen T. Auvinen P. Alanen-Kurki L. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17261-17269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed the key regulatory regions for the basal and induced expression (19Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jaakkola P. Auvinen P. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12532-12541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, we have found that an enhancer for syndecan-1 gene (named FiRE for FGF-inducible response element) is activated in vivo in wound edge keratinocytes and that in cultured keratinocytes, FiRE can be activated by KGF and EGF (21Jaakkola P. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Jaakkola P. Kontusaari S. Kauppi T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this enhancer element is not sufficient for the default expression in suprabasal cells: the only epidermal expression detected in the FiRE-LacZ mice occurs at the wound edge (22Jaakkola P. Kontusaari S. Kauppi T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed whether different matrix molecules can modulate the syndecan-1 levels. We were interested in that aspect of the regulation of syndecan-1 gene for the following reasons. First, the activation of the syndecan-1 in the migrating epidermal sheet of the wound edge is not uniform, as the merging frontiers of the two sheets are syndecan-1-negative (14Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Second, the extracellular matrix is a strong candidate to modify the gene expression of wound keratinocytes that both encounter a new matrix and produce and remodel it, as shown by the collagen-induced changes in the expression of the interstitial collagenase (23Sudbeck B.D. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Pentland A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30022-30029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that fibrillar collagen but not fibronectin suppresses the activation of syndecan-1 by KGF. EGF and TGF-α, on the other hand, were able to activate FiRE regardless the matrix. This regulation takes place at transcriptional level and establishes FiRE as a target for both ECM and growth factor receptor derived signals. MCA-3D is a keratinocyte cell line derived from carcinogen-treated mouse skin (24Kulesz-Martin M. Kilkenny A.E. Holbrook K.A. Digernes V. Yuspa S.H. Carcinogenesis. 1983; 4: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is not, however, tumorigenic in nude mice (17Inki P. Kujari H. Jalkanen M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 314-323PubMed Google Scholar). MCA-3D cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,l-glutamine, streptomycin, and penicillin. The effects of various growth factors were studied in cells starved for 24 or 48 h in Ham's medium without serum or in Ham's medium supplemented in 1% carboxymethyl-Sephadex-eluted fetal calf serum. Growth factors were purchased from Peprotech and used in a concentration of 10 ng/ml. To study the effects of ECM molecules, tissue culture plates were coated overnight at +4 °C with 50 μg/ml fibrillar collagen (Vitrogen-100, Collagen Corp.), fibronectin (Sigma), laminin-1 (EHS-laminin), or native bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Cell proliferation was determined as the incorporation of [125I]dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To this end, the cells were treated with growth factors for 12 h following by pulse labeling with 0.25 μCi/ml [125I]dUTP for additional 4 h. The cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 1n NaOH. Incorporated radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter (LKB Wallac). For the quantitation of syndecan-1 in the conditioned medium of the MCA-3D keratinocytes, starved cells were treated with growth factors for 24 h. The medium was replaced with fresh medium, and cells were incubated for another 4 h. This medium was then collected, and the cell number was estimated by crystal violet staining as described in Ref. 25Mali M. Andtfolk H. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27795-27798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Syndecan-1 levels were measured in slot-blotted aliquots of the medium by monoclonal antibody 281-2 (26Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was normalized against cell number for comparison among different growth factor treatments. Keratinocytes were grown on coated 10-cm tissue culture dishes as described above. Total RNA was isolated as described (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Ten-μg aliquots of RNA were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and sequentially probed with 32P-labeled DNA fragments for mouse syndecan-1 (28Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 107: 1199-1205Google Scholar) and rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (29Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. El Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) using hybridization conditions recommended by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The construction of the syndecan-1 enhancer-CAT constructs has been reported earlier (20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reporter gene construct p-271-FiRE (20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) contains the 280-base pair enhancer and a minimal 98-base pair promoter of the syndecan-1 gene; the construct pSynProm-FiRE has a longer, 1.1-kilobase pair promoter with the same enhancer; and the construct pSynProm carries the long promoter only, without the enhancer. The creation of stably transfected cell populations of MCA-3D keratinocytes was performed as in Ref. 19Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jaakkola P. Auvinen P. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12532-12541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. The multiclonal cell lines selected for for CAT assays were pools of independent cell clones. The rationale for this was to avoid position effect in individual insertion events. The cells were selected in 750 μg/ml G418 and maintained in 200 μg/ml G418. In this study, cells up to sixth passage after pooling were used. Cells were cultured and treated with growth factors as described above. Chloramphenicol acetylatransferase activity was measured in cell extracts as described (19Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jaakkola P. Auvinen P. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12532-12541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The values were corrected for the total protein content of the extract (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Anisomycin, an activator of JNK, was used over a range of 30–40 μm to determine the role of Jun amino-terminal kinase in enhancer activation. Whole cell extracts were prepared from growth factor-treated and control cells (20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the transcription factor binding sites in the enhancer for syndecan-1 gene and the conditions used in the binding reactions have been previously described in Refs. 19Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jaakkola P. Auvinen P. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12532-12541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and 20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. The specificities of the complexes were determined by using a 100-fold excess of either specific or nonspecific unlabeled competitors in the binding assays. Polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (indicated in the legends for figures 6 and 7) were used to characterize the transcription factors present in the specific complexes as described (20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We had previously seen that the enhancer for syndecan-1 gene (the FiRE) is activated in wound edge keratinocytes in vivo and that the FiRE can drive reporter gene expression after KGF or EGF treatment (21Jaakkola P. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Jaakkola P. Kontusaari S. Kauppi T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At the wound edge, syndecan-1 induction is not uniform, however, as the leading front of migrating keratinocytes remain syndecan-1-negative (14Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In a search for possible modulators of syndecan-1 activation in the cellular microenvironment at wounds, we investigated whether the activation of FiRE is controlled by combined effects of growth factors and extracellular matrix. We plated polyclonal MCA-3D cell lines harboring stably integrated FiRE-CAT constructs onto either collagen, laminin, or fibronectin matrices and measured CAT activities in response to growth factor treatment. A consistent induction in the CAT activity was observed in the cell lines harboring the constructs with the FiRE enhancer when cells were grown on fibronectin and stimulated by KGF for 6–8 h (Fig.1, A–C). The enhancer was placed with the minimal promoter of syndecan-1 gene (p271-FiRE) or a longer, 1.1-kilobase pair portion of syndecan promoter (pSynProm-FiRE). The effect of the enhancer on the response to KGF was similar with both of these promoters. No induction could be seen with the construct having the promoter alone (pSynProm). Contrary to results with fibronectin, FiRE transfected cells grown on collagen displayed no induction of CAT activity after the application of KGF (Fig. 1, A–C). This suppression was targeted to the FiRE only as the basal CAT activity of the promoter constructs was similar on either matrix. When the KGF treatment was prolonged to 12 or 24 h, a modest induction could be see on collagen-coated plates, as well (Fig. 1 B). However, the measured CAT activities in cells on collagen were always remarkably lower than in cells grown on fibronectin coating. This suppression of the response to KGF was detected in several serial passages of the cells, was independent on the plating density of the cells, and was seen in both transient and stable transfections of the reporter gene constructs (data not shown). Induction by KGF in cells growing on laminin-1 was over 3-fold. Thus, laminin-1 could not inhibit the activation of FiRE similarly to collagen but acted in a manner similar to fibronectin (Fig. 1). The activation of the enhancer by EGF was independent on the matrix (Fig.2). Equal CAT activity was seen on all the matrix molecules after EGF (or TGF-α) treatment. Similarly to the KGF treatment, the promoter lacking an enhancer was not activated by EGF on any of the matrix molecules (Fig. 2). To study whether the different abilities of KGF and EGF to activate FiRE levels in cells on fibrillar collagen are recapitulated at the mRNA level, we performed Northern blotting analyses on combined effect of extracellular matrix and the growth factor action. Cells grown on fibronectin showed increased syndecan-1 mRNA levels after treatment with KGF for 4 h (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, the KGF-dependent induction of syndecan-1 mRNA was inhibited in cells grown on fibrillar collagen (Fig. 3 A). In the case of treatments with EGF, induction of syndecan-1 expression appeared unaffected by the choice of matrix used (Fig. 3 B). The induction caused by EGF was usually higher than by KGF. Typically, EGF increased syndecan-1 steady-state mRNA levels 6–8-fold, whereas KGF resulted in an about 3–4-fold induction (Fig. 3,A and B). Thus, a similar combined effect of KGF and collagen was seen in mRNA levels as in reporter gene activation by FiRE enhancer. Syndecan-1 protein levels were measured from MCA-3D keratinocytes grown on different matrix molecules or on native bovine serum albumin as a nonspecific adhesive substrate. The concentration of shed syndecan-1 ectodomain in the conditioned medium of the keratinocytes was found to be directly proportional to the level of the core protein synthesis (not shown). Thus, the effect of the growth factors on the syndecan-1 protein levels were measured from conditioned medium collected during the last 4 h of a 24-h growth factor treatment. At a concentration of 10 ng/ml, KGF, EGF, and TGF-α were the most effective inducers of the syndecan-1 (Fig. 4). Both EGF and TGF-α resulted in a marked (over 10-fold) increase in the syndecan-1 ectodomain levels regardless of the matrix used as a substratum for cell attachment (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, however, the production of syndecan-1 protein in response to cell treatments with KGF appeared to be dependent on the matrix. MCA-3D cells grown on fibronectin responded to KGF by an increase in syndecan-1 production. On the other hand, cells grown on fibrillar collagen failed to increase syndecan-1 levels in response to KGF exposure (Fig. 4). Thus, the loss of activation seen in the reporter gene assays and at the mRNA steady state levels was finally reflected in the synthesis of syndecan-1 core protein. Quantitation of syndecan production after growth factor treatment was subsequently used to screen possible interactions of ECM signaling and additional growth factors. A modest enhancement was seen in cells grown on all matrix molecules and treated with either bFGF or acidic FGF (Fig. 4). No effects on the syndecan-1 levels were seen by TGF-β or platelet-derived growth factor (data not shown). This result emphasizes further the selectivity of KGF-response of FiRE enhancer as a target of modulation by collagen. We were interested to see whether collagenous matrix can suppress all of the end points of KGF signaling in MCA-3D cells. The ability of KGF to promote the proliferation of MCA-3D cells was assayed by the means of iodo-deoxyuridine (Idu) incorporation into newly synthesized DNA. A similar induction of DNA synthesis was seen in cells on all ECM molecules (Fig. 5). Thus, all aspects of KGF signaling are not compromised in the cells growing on collagen. This is supported by Western blot analysis of FGFR-2, which revealed similar amounts of the KGF-receptor in cells plated on either fibronectin or collagen (not shown). Next, we investigated whether matrix composition can cause changes in the pattern of transcription factors that bind FiRE and enable syndecan-1 induction. We have previously characterized the enhancer by DNaseI footprinting and gel mobility shift assays (20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,21Jaakkola P. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An overview of the enhancer is presented in the Fig.6 A. In 3T3 fibroblasts, the enhancer can be bound by both transcription factors that are induced by bFGF and by factors constitutively present in the cells. The enhancer harbors binding sites for two growth factor-inducible AP-1 complexes and for one inducible, as yet uncharacterized transcription factor (20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In MCA-3D keratinocytes, on the other hand, transcription factor binding is not affected by growth factors that activate FiRE (21Jaakkola P. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, there remained a possibility that ECM can cause the induction or suppression of transcription factor binding and thus modulate the growth factor effects on the cell. In order to investigate the effect of ECM on transcription factor binding to FiRE, we used gel mobility shift assays. The most 3′-motif (motif 1) of the enhancer binds an uncharacterized 46-kDa protein constitutively expressed in 3T3 cells (21Jaakkola P. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of this protein was equally present in treated and control MCA-3D cells and was unchanged by extracellular matrix molecules (data not shown). Motif 2 contains an E-box that is bound by USF-1 in both cell lines (20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Jaakkola P. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 B shows equal binding activity of USF in both control and growth factor-treated cells on fibronectin and in KGF-treated cells grown on collagen. An antibody against USF abolished the bound specific complex, whereas antibodies against other bHLH factors (anti-Max shown) did not affect the complex formation (Fig.6 B). Motif 3, which binds an bFGF-inducible unidentified factor in 3T3 cells does not bind that protein in growth factor-treated MCA-3D cells (21Jaakkola P. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Neither fibronectin nor collagen alone or in combination with growth factors induced specific transcription factor binding to this site (Fig. 6 C). Motifs 4 and 5 are occupied by the members of AP-1 (Fos/Jun) family (20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Jaakkola P. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The AP-1 binding activity was unchanged by the extracellular matrix (Fig.7 A). We furthermore investigated whether the composition of AP-1 complexes is affected by matrix. Again, the same complexes were formed in cells growing on collagen as in those on fibronectin. Antibodies against c-Fos or JunD abrogated or supershifted the complexes with motif 4 (Fig.7 B). The same complex was observed in cells growing on all tested ECM molecules and treated with either KGF or EGF (data not shown). In summary, changes in transcription factor binding activities did not explain the diminished activation in cells grown on collagen. This suggested that matrix-dependent regulation of syndecan-1 induction during growth factor treatment occurred at the posttranslational modifications of transcription factors. As AP-1 sites were necessary for the FiRE activation in vitro (20Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Jaakkola P. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we examined several pathways that converge AP-1 activation. Anisomycin, a known inducer of Jun amino-terminal kinase and p38 stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (JNK) activity (31Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E. Ahmad M. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar), caused a reduction in FiRE activation in cells growing on collagen compared with fibronectin (Fig.8 A). Thus, it appears that the activation of JNK could, in turn, activate FiRE in keratinocytes in a manner that can be inhibited by the ECM. The activity of the pSynProm construct without the enhancer sequences was unchanged by anisomycin (Fig. 8 B). This indicates that the induction seen with the enhancer construct is not due to nonspecific effect of the anisomycin on the translation or stability of the CAT protein. Interestingly, KGF and anisomycin had a synergistic effect, as the activation of the enhancer was higher when they were administered together (Fig.8 A). This synergistic activation was, as well, lower on collagen than on fibronectin (Fig. 8 A). The finding suggests that parallel signaling pathways act in concert to regulate FiRE. Evidence supporting multipathway regulation came from our recent experiments with FiRE-LacZ, in which anisomycin and a growth factor mixture were needed together to activate FiRE in an organ culture of unwounded skin (22Jaakkola P. Kontusaari S. Kauppi T. Määttä A. Jalkanen M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Additi"

https://openalex.org/W2049655467,"Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) is an important clinical agent that is inhaled into the airways where it degrades DNA to lower molecular weight fragments, thus reducing the viscoelasticity of sputum and improving the lung function of cystic fibrosis patients. To investigate DNases with potentially improved properties, we constructed a molecular fusion of human DNase I with the hinge and Fc region of human IgG1 heavy chain, creating a DNase I-Fc fusion protein. Infection of Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculovirus resulted in the expression and secretion of the DNase I-Fc fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified from the culture medium using protein A affinity chromatography followed by desalting by gel filtration and was characterized by amino-terminal sequence, amino acid composition, and a variety of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and activity assays. The purified fusion contains DNase I, as determined by a DNase I ELISA and an actin-binding ELISA, and an intact antibody Fc region, which was quantified by an Fc ELISA, in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio, respectively. The dimeric DNase I-Fc fusion was functionally active in enzymatic DNA digestion assays, albeit about 10-fold less than monomeric DNase I. Cleavage of the DNase I-Fc fusion by papain resulted in a specific activity comparable to the monomeric enzyme. Salt was inhibitory for wild type monomeric DNase I but actually enhanced the activity of the dimeric DNase I-Fc fusion. The DNase I-Fc fusion protein was also less Ca2+-dependent than DNase I itself. These results are consistent with a higher affinity of the dimeric fusion protein to DNA than monomeric DNase I. The engineered DNase I-Fc fusion protein described herein has properties that may have clinical benefits. Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) is an important clinical agent that is inhaled into the airways where it degrades DNA to lower molecular weight fragments, thus reducing the viscoelasticity of sputum and improving the lung function of cystic fibrosis patients. To investigate DNases with potentially improved properties, we constructed a molecular fusion of human DNase I with the hinge and Fc region of human IgG1 heavy chain, creating a DNase I-Fc fusion protein. Infection of Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculovirus resulted in the expression and secretion of the DNase I-Fc fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified from the culture medium using protein A affinity chromatography followed by desalting by gel filtration and was characterized by amino-terminal sequence, amino acid composition, and a variety of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and activity assays. The purified fusion contains DNase I, as determined by a DNase I ELISA and an actin-binding ELISA, and an intact antibody Fc region, which was quantified by an Fc ELISA, in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio, respectively. The dimeric DNase I-Fc fusion was functionally active in enzymatic DNA digestion assays, albeit about 10-fold less than monomeric DNase I. Cleavage of the DNase I-Fc fusion by papain resulted in a specific activity comparable to the monomeric enzyme. Salt was inhibitory for wild type monomeric DNase I but actually enhanced the activity of the dimeric DNase I-Fc fusion. The DNase I-Fc fusion protein was also less Ca2+-dependent than DNase I itself. These results are consistent with a higher affinity of the dimeric fusion protein to DNA than monomeric DNase I. The engineered DNase I-Fc fusion protein described herein has properties that may have clinical benefits. A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) polyvinylidene difluoride enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay The ability of recombinant human DNase I (DNase I) to degrade DNA to lower molecular weight fragments is the basis for its therapeutic use in cystic fibrosis patients (1Ramsey B.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). It is inhaled into the airways where it reduces the viscoelasticity of cystic fibrosis sputum, resulting in improved lung function and fewer respiratory exacerbations (2Ramsey B.W. Astley S.J.

In addition, the use of DNase I in a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus has been investigated with encouraging results (4Macanovic M. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Baughman S. Thiru S. Lachmann P.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 106: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The pharmacological and clinical significance of DNase I has led us recently to engineer actin-resistant variants of the human enzyme that are no longer inhibited by actin (5Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as well as hyperactive variants that alter the functional mechanism of DNA cleavage (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11701-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); characterization of these variants under biologically relevant ex vivo conditions has shown a marked improvement in potency compared with wild type (8Pan C.Q.

Furthermore, we have recently addressed the functional importance of various residues of human DNase I at the DNA binding interface by extensive mutagenesis (9Pan C.Q. Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Lazarus R.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). DNase I is an endonuclease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of double-stranded DNA predominantly by a single-stranded nicking mechanism under physiological conditions when both Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions are present (10Campbell V.W. Jackson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3726-3735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hyperactive variants have been shown to use a more efficient functional mechanism involving processive nicking which yielded a greater number of double-stranded breaks as a result of higher affinity for DNA (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11701-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The hyperactive variants were selected from a mutational scanning analysis of the DNase I-DNA interface where Arg or Lys replacements resulted in attractive interactions with the negatively charged phosphates on the DNA backbone. In addition, the tighter binding to DNA also eliminated the significant inhibition of DNase I by physiological saline. In the present study, we have expressed and characterized a DNase I-Fc fusion, resulting in a dimeric form of DNase I (Fig.1). We hypothesized that dimerization of DNase I using the hinge and Fc portion of IgG1 could impart several interesting properties. Dimerization could result in an enzyme with enhanced ability to degrade DNA having increased levels of “cutting” relative to “nicking” if each active site of the dimer bound to the same molecule of DNA. Furthermore, the potential enhanced binding affinity of a dimeric versus a monomeric form of DNase I could also lead to an enzyme that is more resistant to inhibition by salt. The strategy we chose to dimerize DNase I has also been used on many other ligands to make protein-IgG chimera termed immunoadhesins (11Ashkenazi A. Chamow S.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Chamow S.M. Ashkenazi A. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 52-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); these often have a longer pharmacokinetic half-life, similar to humanized monoclonal antibodies, which may be desirable for therapeutic use. Although many immunoadhesins have been characterized, to our knowledge, this is only the third example of an immunoadhesin that is an active enzyme (13Klein A. Krishna M. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7782-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Tournay C. Courtoy P.J. Marodi L. Totte P. Werenne J. Jacquet A. Garcia-Quintana L. Bollen A. Moguilevsky N. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used for the construction of recombinant transfer vectors based on the vector pVL1393 (PharMingen) (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 16O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). The pVL1393-derived plasmid pbPH.His was linearized withNcoI and SmaI and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The Fc portion of the human IgG1 was obtained as a 700-base pair fragment by restriction digestion using NdeI and subsequent treatment with Klenow and NcoI of another pVL1393-derived plasmid pVL1393.IgG. Following ligation, competentEscherichia coli XL-1 Blue was transformed, and bacteria were selected for the correct recombinant plasmid (pVL1393.Fc) by DNA sequence analysis. Then, pVL1393.Fc was linearized withBamHI and StuI and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The linearized vector was then ligated with a DNase I cDNA insert. The full-length human DNase I cDNA insert contained within the plasmid pRK.DNase (17Shak S. Capon D.J. Hellmiss R. Marsters S.A. Baker C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9188-9192Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) was obtained as a 1 kilobase fragment by restriction enzyme digestion usingBamHI and StuI. Following ligation, competentE. coli XL-1 Blue was transformed, and bacteria were selected for the correct recombinant plasmid (termed pVL.1393.DNase I-Fc) by DNA sequence analysis using the dRhodamine dye-terminator method and an Applied Biosystems ABI Model 373 automated DNA sequencer. Recombinant transfer vectors were purified by Qiagen Maxi-Preps and used for construction of recombinant baculovirus. Three DNase I-Fc variants having different linker lengths between the DNase I and the Fc were made (VEVMLK … (GGS)nP … DKTHTCPPCP, wheren = 0, 1, 2; these were termed L0, L1, and L2, respectively). Since the constructs all had similar properties, the results reported herein refer to the L2 linker. Recombinant baculovirus, AcNpV.DNase I-Fc, was generated following cotransfection of Sf9 cells with the transfer vector and the linearized wild type baculovirus DNA (Autographa californicanuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNpV),1 PharMingen). A primary amplification of the recombinant baculovirus, AcNpV.DNase I-Fc, achieved detectable protein expression. Subsequent plaque purification and titering of the viral stock were performed by plaque assays. Standard methods were utilized as described previously (16O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Adherent cultures of Spodeptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells (ATCC CRL 1711) were maintained at 28 °C in Hink's TNM-FH-supplemented Grace's insect medium (JRH Biosciences, catalog number 51942-78P) with glutamine, streptomycin/penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C). Cultures were passaged every 3 days. Spinner cultures of High Five (Invitrogen) cells (500 ml at 2.0 × 106 cells/ml) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 and harvested 60 h post-transfection. Suspension cultures were maintained in spinner flasks at 28 °C using ESF-921 protein-free insect cell culture medium (Expression Systems LLC, catalog number 96-001). Cultures were passaged every 3 days to a starting cell density of 106 cells/ml. The medium at the end of the fermentation had dropped to pH 5.5 from pH 7.5 and was capable of reducing DTNB; the initial medium did not reduce DTNB. Following the optimized infection protocol, the High Five cells were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The clarified supernatant (2 liters) was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 4 changes of 8 liters of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2 (buffer 1) and filtered using a 0.22-μm Nalgene filter. The dialyzed supernatant (2 liters) was applied to a 5 ml Hi-Trap protein A column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer 1 at 25 °C. After washing with 50 ml of buffer 1, the column was treated with 3.5 mMgCl2 in distilled H2O at 0.5 ml/min. The DNase I-Fc fractions (as judged by SDS-PAGE and A 280) were pooled and loaded onto a series of 5-ml PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer 1. After elution with 1.2 column volumes of buffer 1, the DNase I-Fc fractions (as judged by SDS-PAGE and A 280) were pooled and concentrated using a Centriplus-30 concentrator (Amicon), which had been pretreated overnight with 5% Tween 20. Proteins were separated by 10% Tris glycine SDS-PAGE (NOVEX) along with prestained protein molecular weight markers (SeaBlue, NOVEX) using the method of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). For Western analysis, proteins in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, NOVEX). After blocking nonspecific binding with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, the membrane was probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human DNase I antibody; proteins were then detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An aliquot of the purified DNase I-Fc fusion was also treated with PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and run on a nonreducing gel as described above. An aliquot of the purified DNase I-Fc fusion was run at 0.35 ml/min on an S-200 column in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mmCa2+, and 150 mm NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Purified DNase I-Fc fusion was treated with 0.1 mm DTNB in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm Ca2+ to detect any free cysteines;l-Cys was used as a standard curve by measuring the absorbance at 412 nm. DNase I-Fc purified from the infected Sf9 cell supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. Electroblotting onto Millipore Immobilon-PSQ membranes was carried out for 1 h at 250 mA constant current in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot transfer cell (19Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PVDF membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 50% methanol, for 0.5 min, and destained for 2–3 min with 10% acetic acid in 50% methanol. The membrane was thoroughly washed with water and allowed to dry before storage at −20 °C. The DNase I-Fc bands at about 120 kDa were cut, and the first 12 residues were sequenced using a model 494A Applied Biosystems sequencer equipped with an on-line PTH analyzer. Peaks were integrated with Justice Innovation software using Nelson Analytical 760 interfaces. Sequence interpretation was performed on a DEC Alpha 8400 (20Henzel W.J. Rodriguez H. Watanabe C. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 404: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Samples were hydrolyzed using 6n HCl containing 0.1% phenol at 110 °C for 24 h. Amino acids were analyzed on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer using post-column detection with ninhydrin. DNase I concentrations for the DNase I-Fc fusion protein were determined by ELISA using a rabbit anti-DNase I polyclonal antibody coat and detecting with a goat anti-DNase I polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (5Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Multiple sample dilutions were compared with standard curves of purified recombinant human DNase I (Pulmozyme®; Genentech) to determine concentrations of DNase I for the DNase I-Fc fusion proteins. The concentration of the DNase I-Fc protein was calculated taking into account the molecular weights and molarities. Fc concentrations for the DNase I-Fc protein were determined by ELISA using a rabbit anti-human Fc polyclonal antibody coat and were detected with a rabbit anti-human Fc polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. As above, multiple sample dilutions were compared with standard curves of human Fc (Sigma) to determine concentrations of Fc for DNase I-Fc. The concentration of DNase I-Fc was calculated taking into account the molecular weights and molarities. The actin-binding ELISA for DNase I or DNase I-Fc was carried out essentially as described previously (5Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition to detecting with an anti-human DNase I polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (5Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a duplicate plate was assayed using 100 μl/well of an anti-human Fc rabbit polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (19 ng/ml). Color was developed by adding 100 μl/well of Sigma Fast o-phenylenediamine and urea/H2O2 reagent and stopped by adding 100 μl/well 4.5 n H2SO4. TheA 492 was measured and plotted versusthe DNase I-Fc concentration. Recombinant human DNase I (Pulmozyme®, Genentech) was assayed as a positive control. The sigmoidal curves were fit to a four-parameter equation by nonlinear regression analysis (21Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar); the EC50 value is the DNase I-Fc or DNase I concentration that produced a half-maximal signal. Dilutions of baculoviral infected cell culture media or purified DNase I-Fc at room temperature in the presence of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2 with different NaCl concentrations were incubated with 160 μl of 30 μg/ml supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA (New England Biolabs) or 160 μl of 30 μg/mlEcoRI-linearized pBR322 (purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation). For reactions with Mg2+ or Mn2+ without Ca2+, 1 mm of the metal ion and 0.1 mm EGTA was included in the reaction mix. At selected time intervals, 30-μl aliquots of the reaction mix were quenched with 25 mm EDTA, 6% glycerol, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue and loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was run overnight at ∼1 V/cm in TBE (90 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA), stained with ethidium bromide, and quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics model 575 FluorImager. The overall activity was estimated from the initial rate of disappearance of supercoiled or linear substrate. The linear to relaxed ratio was also determined from the initial rates of appearance of linear and relaxed products. Mock-infected media with similar dilutions showed no background activity. The catalytic activity by either wild type DNase I or the DNase I-Fc fusion on the hydrolysis of a small molecule substrate, p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate (Sigma), was determined by monitoring the increase inA 405 as a result of the generation ofp-nitrophenol. Reactions were carried out with 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate incubated with culture media in the presence of 60 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm MgCl2, and 50 mmCaCl2. Papain digestion of purified DNase I-Fc was performed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The final mixture (150 μl total volume) contained 36 μg/ml DNase I-Fc, 3.3 mm cysteine, 0.67 mm EDTA, 42 μg/ml papain (Worthington 3126-PAP, 22 units/mg) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.3. The reaction was quenched by addition of 6 μl of freshly prepared 130 mm iodoacetic acid at pH 6.8 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The digestion was evaluated by SDS-PAGE using a NOVEX 4–20% gradient gel with and without 0.15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. High Five spinner cultures were infected with the recombinant baculovirus AcNpV.DNase I-Fc. Expression of the secreted DNase I-Fc protein was confirmed by adsorption of tissue culture supernatant to protein A-conjugated beads followed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. A protein band that was immunoreactive against both an anti-DNase I antibody and an anti-Fc antibody was detected (data not shown). To purify the DNase I-Fc fusion, the baculoviral infected High Five supernatants were harvested 72 h after the initial infection. After removal of the High Five cells by centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2. The dialyzed sample was filtered and loaded onto a Hi-Trap protein A column. After elution with 3.5 m MgCl2, the DNase I-Fc-containing fractions, which were determined byA 280 and SDS-PAGE, were desalted using a PD-10 column and concentrated using Centriplus-30 concentrators. Dialysis of the cell culture medium prior to purification on protein A was essential for eliminating the aggregation observed in the absence of this step; no evidence of higher order aggregates for the purified fusion were found by gel filtration chromatography or nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis (data not shown). In addition, no free cysteines were detected using DTNB, implying that all of the disulfides are formed. Purified DNase I-Fc was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2). Under nonreducing conditions, Coomassie Blue staining revealed a predominant band and a minor band with a molecular mass of ∼120 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Amino-terminal sequencing of each of these bands confirmed the DNase I sequence. Under reducing conditions, a single predominant band of ∼62 kDa was found. A minor band migrating at ∼45 kDa, which was unidentifiable by amino-terminal sequencing, is perhaps due to a reduced heavy chain of bovine IgG, which commonly has a blocked amino terminus. Immunoblot analysis using either an anti-Fc antibody (Fig. 2 B) or an anti-DNase I antibody (Fig.2 C) revealed a similar pattern of protein bands. The concentration of DNase I-Fc was determined by amino acid analysis, an Fc ELISA, and a DNase I ELISA. After accounting for the amount of Fc or DNase I proteins in the DNase I-Fc fusion, amino acid analysis determined the concentration of 28.5 μg/ml; the Fc ELISA and DNase I ELISA determined the concentrations of 27.8 and 17.5 μg/ml, respectively. The binding affinity of DNase I-Fc for G-actin was assessed by an ELISA where actin was bound to immobilized Gc globulin, a protein whose affinity for actin is unaffected by DNase I. Using the anti-human DNase I polyclonal antibody for detection, the EC50 value was 0.003 μg/ml for either DNase I or the DNase I-Fc fusion. These results suggest that DNase I-Fc is correctly folded and binds G-actin with the same affinity as DNase I. Further evidence that the Fc was indeed fused to DNase I was determined by capturing fusion protein with actin via binding to the DNase I portion and detecting with an anti-human Fc rabbit polyclonal antibody. To compare the DNA hydrolytic activity of DNase I-Fc and DNase I, supercoiled plasmid was used as a substrate for DNA cleavage under different metal ion conditions. A single nick on one of the two supercoiled DNA strands results in the formation of a relaxed circle that can subsequently be converted to linear DNA if it is nicked on the other strand at the same position. In the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+, monomeric wild type human DNase I cleaves double-stranded DNA via a nicking mechanism as evidenced by its ability to yield the linear DNA product only after nearly complete conversion of the supercoiled substrate to the relaxed circle intermediate (Fig.3). In the presence of Mn2+, human DNase I employs more of a cutting mechanism as demonstrated by a dramatic increase in the linear to relaxed product ratio, consistent with our previous studies (9Pan C.Q. Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Lazarus R.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Under both metal ion conditions, the overall activity corresponding to the rate of disappearance of the supercoiled substrate for the dimeric DNase I-Fc fusion is ∼10-fold lower than that of the native monomeric DNase I; however, the dimeric enzyme appears to generate a slightly higher linear to relaxed product ratio. As compared with the optimal conditions of Mg2+ and Ca2+, the removal of Ca2+ or the addition of 150 mm NaCl results in ∼10-fold lower activities for the monomeric DNase I but not for the dimeric fusion (TableI). As a result, under these suboptimal conditions for DNase I, DNase I-Fc has approximately the same activities as DNase I.Table ISupercoiled plasmid DNA nicking activity of DNase I and DNase I-FcMetal ionsDNase IaThe overall plasmid nicking activities are reported in nm DNA min−1 nm−1 DNase I.

Note that 1 nm DNase I-Fc is equivalent to 2 nmDNase I. Open table in a new tab To address the ionic effects on the DNA cleavage activity in more detail,EcoRI-linearized plasmid pBR322 was treated with DNase I or DNase I-Fc under increasing salt concentrations. Wild type DNase I is highly sensitive to inhibition by salt; significant inhibition is observed at 25 mm NaCl, with 50% inhibition at ∼60 mm NaCl (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the activity of the dimeric DNase I-Fc fusion actually increases as the salt concentration is elevated from 0 to 50 mm. The linear DNA digestion activity of the DNase I-Fc fusion is optimal from 50 to 100 mm NaCl and becomes inhibited only at higher salt concentrations (Fig. 4). The catalytic competency of the two active sites in the DNase I-Fc fusion should remain intact when using a small molecule substrate analog. Indeed, wild type DNase I and DNase I-Fc, when corrected for the concentration of active sites, displayed similar activities of 1.6 and 2.1A 405 min−1 mg−1 DNase I, respectively, using p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate as the substrate (22Liao T.H. Hsieh J.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus the catalytic machinery of the fusion protein with respect to a small molecule substrate remains intact. To confirm that the reduction in the overall plasmid nicking activity upon dimerization is not due to some expression artifact of the enzyme itself, we treated the DNase I-Fc fusion with papain to regenerate monomeric DNase I. In the presence of Mg2+, Ca2+, and the absence of NaCl, papain digestion of the DNase I-Fc fusion increased the plasmid nicking activity by ∼10-fold, to a level close to that of the monomeric DNase I (Fig. 5); no effect on enzymatic activity was observed by papain treatment of DNase I itself. Papain digestion of the DNase I-Fc fusion (∼62 kDa) showed two new bands migrating at ∼34 and ∼25 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions, which correspond to the molecular masses for DNase I and Fc, respectively (Fig. 6).Figure 6Papain digestion of DNase I-Fc. The DNase I-Fc fusion was digested by papain as analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.”Lane 1, molecular weight markers; lane 2,purified DNase I; lane 3, purified DNase I-Fc; andlane 4, DNase I-Fc after treatment with papain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have fused human DNase I to the Fc region of an IgG heavy chain which can be expressed in the baculovirus system and secreted as a disulfide-bonded homodimer (Fig. 1). The DNase I-Fc fusion can be purified substantially in a single step using affinity chromatography on protein A. The protein migrates with a molecular mass of ∼120 kDa, which is in good agreement with the calculated mass of the protein sequence of 111 kDa, which does not account for glycosylation. The purified protein contains a small amount (<15%) of an isoform that migrates slightly above the major band (Fig. 2 A). This minor band may represent a variant with a different disulfide arrangement; there are two disulfides in DNase I, only one of which is essential for activity (23Price P.A. Stein W.H. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 929-932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as several cysteines involved in intra- or interchain disulfides of the Fc domain. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the medium at the end of the fermentation was capable of reducing DTNB. Furthermore, in the absence of a dialysis step prior to purification on protein A, a significant degree of aggregation occurred. The aggregation of immunoglobulins in the baculovirus expression system has been observed previously, where protein disulfide isomerase has enhanced solubility and facilitated recovery (24Hsu T.A. Watson S. Eiden J.J. Betenbaugh M.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Another possibility for this heterogeneity are different glycosylation patterns in the fusion, since there are two potentialN-linked sites in DNase I and one in the Fc region, and both bands contain the amino-terminal sequence of DNase I. However, this is disfavored since treatment of the DNase I-Fc fusion with PNGase F, which should remove the carbohydrates, did not alter the molecular mass on a nonreducing gel (data not shown). The actin binding experiments showed that the DNase I-Fc fusion binds quantitatively the same as wild type DNase I (5Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore it appears that the baculoviral expression of the fusion with the Fc heavy chain does not alter the structural integrity of DNase I. Detection with the Fc antibody also confirms that the Fc portion of the fusion is intact. Further confirmation that DNase I is correctly folded in the fusion is derived from the fact that the active sites are catalytically intact as determined by similar rates of hydrolysis on the small molecule substrate p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate when compared with wild type DNase I. In addition, cleavage of the fusion by papain resulted in DNase I with comparable specific activity to wild type. The most interesting aspect of this work arises from the characterization of the fusion on a relatively large DNA substrate under different conditions. In the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ or Mn2+ and the absence of NaCl (Fig. 3and Table I), the DNase I-Fc fusion was ∼10-fold less active in the plasmid nicking assay than wild type DNase I. This was independent of the linker length between the Fc and DNase I. This reduction in activity was initially somewhat surprising and unanticipated. However, we can propose two possible explanations for this result. The first is that the second DNase I on the dimer somehow inhibits the activity of the first, most likely by imparting adverse steric interactions. An alternative related and more likely possibility is that binding of both DNases of the dimer to a given DNA at the same time induces a bend in the DNA that alters the geometry of the scissile bonds such that they are no longer optimal for catalysis. This is consistent with crystallographic studies on DNA complexed to DNase I where significant conformational change occurs, resulting in significant DNA bending and a widening of the minor groove (25Suck D. Oefner C. Nature. 1986; 321: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 26Suck D. Lahm A. Oefner C. Nature. 1988; 332: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The width of the minor groove is a major factor that affects DNA cleavage rates (27Drew H.R. Travers A.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In addition, the stiffness and flexibility of DNA also contribute significantly to catalytic rates of hydrolysis (28Hogan M.E. Austin R.H. Nature. 1987; 329: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29Hogan M.E. Robertson M.W. Austin R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9273-9277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Helix parameters such as tilt, rise, and twist could also affect cutting rates. A discussion of DNase I induced conformational changes, and other factors that determine the catalytic efficiency of DNase I has been recently reviewed (30Suck D. J. Mol. Recognit. 1994; 7: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Assuming that distortion of the DNA occurs upon binding of one of the DNases in the DNase I-Fc fusion, perhaps only one of the two active sites can contact the DNA substrate in a manner that permits optimal hydrolysis of phosphodiester bond. However, having two DNases linked together by the Fc fusion may result in a greater frequency of nicking on both strands of the DNA by each monomer, leading to the somewhat higher linear to relaxed product ratio. The ability of a DNase I dimer to create increased levels of cutting relative to nicking could be due to an increased concentration of active sites locally on a given piece of DNA. Given that one monomer can properly interact with DNA to allow DNA cleavage, the other monomer could partially interact with DNA, resulting in greater protein-DNA stability in an analogous fashion as compared with the hyperactive DNase I, engineered by the introduction of additional positively charged residues into the DNA-DNase I interface (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11701-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consequently, the DNase I-Fc fusion and hyperactive DNase I variants share certain characteristics such as greater salt resistance and lower Ca2+ dependence. Like hyperactive DNase I, the fusion dimer is also much less sensitive to salt, with a salt titration profile similar to that of the hyperactive E13R/N74K variant (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Both engineered proteins display optimal activity at ∼100 mm NaCl instead of 0 mm for the wild type monomeric DNase I. The stabilization of the DNA complexed to the first DNase I monomer by the second monomer may replace the role of the protein-stabilizing Ca2+ion 2C. Q. Pan and R. A. Lazarus, submitted for publication.; therefore, in the absence of this metal ion, the activity of DNase I-Fc is not reduced as compared with wild type DNase I (Table I). Finally, under certain conditions, both the DNase I-Fc fusion and the hyperactive variants can have lower catalytic activity than wild type, presumably under conditions where dissociation is rate-limiting (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11701-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition to the biochemical properties of the DNase I-Fc fusion described herein, the possibility that this strategy could impart different pharmacological properties has potentially important consequences. DNase I, albeit at relatively high concentrations, has recently been shown to have some beneficial response in a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus (4Macanovic M. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Baughman S. Thiru S. Lachmann P.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 106: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The pharmacokinetics of DNase I following a single bolus intravenous injection in rats shows a relatively fast dose-dependent clearance followed by a much slower phase, likely modulated by a serum-binding protein (31Mohler M. Cook J. Lewis D. Moore J. Sinicropi D. Championsmith A. Ferraiolo B. Mordenti J. Drug Metabol. Dispos. 1993; 21: 71-75PubMed Google Scholar). The DNase I-Fc fusion, like other Fc-protein fusions termed immunoadhesins (11Ashkenazi A. Chamow S.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Chamow S.M. Ashkenazi A. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 52-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), could have a much longer pharmacokinetic half-life than wild type DNase I, similar to humanized monoclonal antibodies, which may be desirable for therapeutic use. Future studies are planned to address the physiological aspects of the DNase I-Fc fusion.
