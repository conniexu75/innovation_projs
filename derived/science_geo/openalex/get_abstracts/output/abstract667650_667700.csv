Three of these are associated with enhanced infectivity and transmissibility, and there are concerns that B.1.1.7 might compromise the effectiveness of the vaccine. Muik et al. compared the neutralization efficacy of sera from 40 subjects immunized with the BioNTech-Pfizer mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 against a pseudovirus bearing the Wuhan reference strain or the lineage B.1.1.7 spike protein (see the Perspective by Altmann et al. ). Serum was derived from 40 subjects in two age groups 21 days after the booster shot. The vaccine remained effective against B.1.1.7 with a slight but significant decrease in neutralization that was more apparent in participants under 55 years of age. Thus, the vaccine provides a significant “cushion” of protection against this variant. Science , this issue p. 1152 ; see also p. 1103"
https://openalex.org/W3126657865,"A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed in quantities that are sufficient to immunize large populations. Here we report the preclinical development of two vaccine candidates (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) that contain nucleoside-modified messenger RNA that encodes immunogens derived from the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, formulated in lipid nanoparticles. BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted trimerized receptor-binding domain (known as the RBD–foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane S glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation by the substitution of two residues with proline (S(K986P/V987P); hereafter, S(P2) (also known as P2 S)). The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD–foldon bind to human ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% of the S(P2) trimers are in the two-RBD ‘down’, one-RBD ‘up’ state. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate vaccine elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong T-helper-1 CD4+ and IFNγ+CD8+ T cell responses. Prime–boost vaccination of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with the BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres that are 8.2–18.2× that of a panel of SARS-CoV-2-convalescent human sera. The vaccine candidates protect macaques against challenge with SARS-CoV-2; in particular, BNT162b2 protects the lower respiratory tract against the presence of viral RNA and shows no evidence of disease enhancement. Both candidates are being evaluated in phase I trials in Germany and the USA1–3, and BNT162b2 is being evaluated in an ongoing global phase II/III trial (NCT04380701 and NCT04368728). BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 are two candidate mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that elicit high virus-entry inhibition titres in mice, elicit high virus-neutralizing titres in rhesus macaques and protect macaques from SARS-CoV-2 challenge."
https://openalex.org/W3127800895,"The restrictive measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have triggered sudden massive changes to travel behaviors of people all around the world. This study examines the individual mobility patterns for all transport modes (walk, bicycle, motorcycle, car driven alone, car driven in company, bus, subway, tram, train, airplane) before and during the restrictions adopted in ten countries on six continents: Australia, Brazil, China, Ghana, India, Iran, Italy, Norway, South Africa and the United States. This cross-country study also aims at understanding the predictors of protective behaviors related to the transport sector and COVID-19. Findings hinge upon an online survey conducted in May 2020 (N = 9,394). The empirical results quantify tremendous disruptions for both commuting and non-commuting travels, highlighting substantial reductions in the frequency of all types of trips and use of all modes. In terms of potential virus spread, airplanes and buses are perceived to be the riskiest transport modes, while avoidance of public transport is consistently found across the countries. According to the Protection Motivation Theory, the study sheds new light on the fact that two indicators, namely income inequality, expressed as Gini index, and the reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 inhabitants, aggravate respondents’ perceptions. This research indicates that socio-economic inequality and morbidity are not only related to actual health risks, as well documented in the relevant literature, but also to the perceived risks. These findings document the global impact of the COVID-19 crisis as well as provide guidance for transportation practitioners in developing future strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3128572482,"One of the most complex aspects of the veterinarian-client-patient interaction is the clinical decision-making process. Research suggests that the approach to communication used by veterinarians can impact veterinary clients’ involvement in the decision-making process and their ultimate satisfaction. Using different approaches to the decision-making process may affect how information is exchanged and consequently how decisions are made. The objective of this study was to determine pet owners’ expectations with respect to information exchange and decision-making during veterinarian-client-patient interactions and to compare veterinarians’ perceptions of those expectations and the challenges they face in meeting them. Five pet owner focus groups (27 owners) and three veterinarian focus groups (24 veterinarians) were conducted with standardized open-ended questions and follow-up probes. Thematic analysis of the transcribed data was conducted to identify trends and patterns that emerged during the focus groups. Three pet owner-based themes were identified: 1) understanding the client; 2) providing information suitable for the client; and 3) decision-making. In addition, three barriers for veterinarians affecting information exchange and decision-making were identified: 1) time constraints; 2) involvement of multiple clients; and 3) language barriers. Results suggest that pet owners expect to be supported by their veterinarian to make informed decisions by understanding the client’s current knowledge, tailoring information and educating clients about their options. Breakdowns in the information exchange process can impact pet owners’ perceptions of veterinarians’ motivations. Pet owners’ emphasis on partnership suggests that a collaborative approach between veterinarians and clients may improve client satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W3127530919,"Effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs are desperately needed. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears as an attractive target for drug development. We show that the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of ~6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro and found ~50 compounds with activity against Mpro. Subsequent dose validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 ≤ 50 μM. Hits from our screen are enriched with hepatitis C NS3/4A protease targeting drugs including boceprevir, ciluprevir. narlaprevir, and telaprevir. This work suggests previous large-scale commercial drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3/4A viral protease should be revisited because some previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than boceprevir and suitable for rapid repurposing."
https://openalex.org/W3122078386,"Recent studies have investigated the composition and functional effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by a variety of cell types. However, the mechanisms underlying the impact of these vesicles on neurotransmission remain unclear. Here, we isolated EVs secreted by rat and mouse hippocampal neurons and found that they contain synaptic-vesicle-associated proteins, in particular the vesicular SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor [NSF]-attachment protein receptor) synaptobrevin (also called VAMP). Using a combination of electrophysiology and live-fluorescence imaging, we demonstrate that this extracellular pool of synaptobrevins can rapidly integrate into the synaptic vesicle cycle of host neurons via a CD81-dependent process and selectively augment inhibitory neurotransmission as well as specifically rescue neurotransmission in synapses deficient in synaptobrevin. These findings uncover a novel means of interneuronal communication and functional coupling via exchange of vesicular SNAREs."
https://openalex.org/W3123793254,"Introduction COVID-19 incidence is increasing and different measures have been adopted to control the spread of the pandemic in Ethiopia. Among these measures, enhancing the knowledge, positive attitudes, and proper practices of prevention measures about the disease is a basic strategy to control it. However, community compliance to control measures is largely dependent on their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. Objective To assess the current level of KAP towards COVID-19 pandemic and predictors among the rural dwellers in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia; 2020. Methods This community-based prospective cross-sectional study was carried out from May 1–30, 2020 on a sample of 1,278 adult populations in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to choice the study participants. The data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. We have entered data using Epi data version 3.1 and all analyses were done using SPSS version 25. KAPs scores of study participants based on their independent variables were compared using Chi-square test, t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as required. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with KAP. The important assumptions of the logistic regression model were checked to be satisfied. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the existence and strength of associations. Results From a total of 1,214 study participants, the overall attained knowledge, attitude and practice score about COVID-19 were 90%, 82.4% and 65%, respectively. Among these, 43.9%, 37.5%, and 24.4% of the study participants had demonstrated good knowledge, high attitude and proper practice, respectively. The mean knowledge scores were significantly different between sex, categories of marital status, educational levels, main occupation, and the monthly income quintiles of the study participants (p&lt;0.05). Similarly, the mean attitude scores significantly varied across educational levels, main occupations and marital status (p&lt;0.05). Based on multivariable logistic regression analysis, main occupation of the government employees, education level of diploma and above, highest and second highest wealth rank were positively associated with COVID-19 prevention and control practice. Conclusions The majority of study participants had showed good knowledge and optimistic attitude toward COVID-19. But, the level of practice lower than that expected to maximize effective control measures. Further public education interventions and community sensitization campaigns are required for rural adult population in the Sidama regional state, Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3083068306,"A simulation model is developed to analyze the spread of covid-19 in universities. The model can be used to conduct a what-if analysis and estimate infection cases under different policies. For proof-of-concept, the model is simulated for a hypothetical university of 25,000 students and 3,000 faculty/staff in a U.S. college town. Simulation results show that early outbreaks are very likely, and there is no silver bullet to avoid them. Instead, a combination of policies should be carefully implemented. The results suggest (almost) full remote university operations from the beginning of the semester. In a less-preferred alternative, if universities decide to have students attend in person, they should encourage remote operations for high-risk individuals, conduct frequent rapid tests, enforce mask use, communicate with students and employees about the risks, and promote social distancing. Universities should be willing to move to remote operations if cases rise. Under this scenario, and considering implementation challenges, many universities are still likely to experience an early outbreak, and the likelihood of having a case of death is worrisome. In the long run, students and faculty react to the risks, and even if universities decide to continue operations, classes are likely to have very low in-person attendance. Overall, our analysis depicts several sources of system complexities, negative unintended consequences of relying on a single policy, non-linear incremental effects, and positive synergies of implementing multiple policies. A simulation platform for a what-if analysis is offered so marginal effectiveness of different policies and different decision-making thresholds for closure can be tested for universities of varying populations."
https://openalex.org/W3123996922,"Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a life-threatening disorder most often caused by dominant mutations of ELANE that interfere with neutrophil maturation. We conducted a pooled CRISPR screen in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that correlated ELANE mutations with neutrophil maturation potential. Highly efficient gene editing of early exons elicited nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), overcame neutrophil maturation arrest in HSPCs from ELANE-mutant SCN patients, and produced normal hematopoietic engraftment function. Conversely, terminal exon frameshift alleles that mimic SCN-associated mutations escaped NMD, recapitulated neutrophil maturation arrest, and established an animal model of ELANE-mutant SCN. Surprisingly, only -1 frame insertions or deletions (indels) impeded neutrophil maturation, whereas -2 frame late exon indels repressed translation and supported neutrophil maturation. Gene editing of primary HSPCs allowed faithful identification of variant pathogenicity to clarify molecular mechanisms of disease and encourage a universal therapeutic approach to ELANE-mutant neutropenia, returning normal neutrophil production and preserving HSPC function."
https://openalex.org/W3128952341,"This paper adds to the growing literature of cryptocurrency and behavioral finance. Specifically, we investigate the relationships between the novel investor attention and financial characteristics of Bitcoin, i.e., return and realized volatility, which are the two most important characteristics of one certain asset. Our empirical results show supports in the behavior finance area and argue that investor attention is the granger cause to changes in Bitcoin market both in return and realized volatility. Moreover, we make in-depth investigations by exploring the linear and non-linear connections of investor attention on Bitcoin. The results indeed demonstrate that investor attention shows sophisticated impacts on return and realized volatility of Bitcoin. Furthermore, we conduct one basic and several long horizons out-of-sample forecasts to explore the predictive ability of investor attention. The results show that compared with the traditional historical average benchmark model in forecasting technologies, investor attention improves prediction accuracy in Bitcoin return. Finally, we build economic portfolios based on investor attention and argue that investor attention can further generate significant economic values. To sum up, investor attention is a non-negligible pricing factor for Bitcoin asset."
https://openalex.org/W3127402527,"Objectives To investigate the relationship between metabolically healthy obesity and cardiovascular disease risk in Taiwanese individuals. Methods Taiwanese individuals were recruited from a nationwide, representative community-based prospective cohort study and classified according to body mass index as follows: normal weight (18.5–23.9 kilogram (kg)/meter(m) 2 ) and obesity/overweight (≥24 kg/m 2 ). Participants without diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia and who did not meet the metabolic syndrome without waist circumference criteria were considered metabolically healthy. The study end points were cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were obtained from a Cox regression analysis. Results Among 5 358 subjects (mean [standard deviation] age, 44.5 [15.3] years; women, 48.2%), 1 479 were metabolically healthy with normal weight and 491 were metabolically healthy with obesity. The prevalence of metabolically healthy obesity/overweight was 8.6% in the Taiwanese general population, which included individuals who were &gt;20 years old, not pregnant, and did not have CVD (n = 5,719). In the median follow-up period of 13.7 years, 439 cardiovascular disease events occurred overall and 24 in the metabolically healthy obesity group. Compared with the reference group, the metabolically healthy obesity group had a significantly higher cardiovascular disease risk (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.74, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 2.99). Conclusions Individuals with metabolically healthy obesity have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and require aggressive body weight control for cardiovascular disease control."
https://openalex.org/W3124715823,"The serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) protects the pancreas from intrapancreatic trypsin activation that can lead to pancreatitis. Loss-of-function genetic variants of SPINK1 increase the risk for chronic pancreatitis, often by diminishing inhibitor expression or secretion. Variants that are secreted normally have been presumed to be pathogenic because of defective trypsin inhibition, but evidence has been lacking. Here, we report quantitative studies on the inhibition of human trypsins by wildtype SPINK1 and seven secreted missense variants. We found that tyrosine sulfation of human trypsins weakens binding of SPINK1 because of altered interactions with Tyr43 in the SPINK1 reactive loop. Using authentic sulfated human trypsins, we provide conclusive evidence that SPINK1 variants N34S, N37S, R65Q, and Q68R have unimpaired inhibitory activity, whereas variant P55S exhibits a small and clinically insignificant binding defect. In contrast, rare variants K41N and I42M that affect the reactive-site peptide bond of SPINK1 decrease inhibitor binding by 20,000- to 30,000-fold and three- to sevenfold, respectively. Taken together, the observations indicate that defective trypsin inhibition by SPINK1 variants is an uncommon mechanism in chronic pancreatitis. The results also strengthen the notion that a decline in inhibitor levels explains pancreatitis risk associated with the large majority of SPINK1 variants.

The results also strengthen the notion that a decline in inhibitor levels explains pancreatitis risk associated with the large majority of SPINK1 variants. The pancreas secretes a variety of digestive enzymes, including several isoforms of the proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase. Trypsin isoforms, encoded by the serine protease 1, 2, and 3 genes, are commonly denoted as cationic trypsin, anionic trypsin, and mesotrypsin, based on their relative isoelectric points. To protect the pancreas, digestive proteases are secreted as inactive precursors, named zymogens, which become activated in the duodenum. The intestinal transmembrane protease enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen to trypsin, which, in turn, activates chymotrypsinogens, proelastases, and procarboxypeptidases to their active form (1Rinderknecht H. Activation of pancreatic zymogens. Normal activation, premature intrapancreatic activation, protective mechanisms against inappropriate activation.Dig. Dis. Sci. 1986; 31: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Among the digestive proenzymes, trypsinogen has the unique ability to undergo autoactivation, a self-amplifying bimolecular reaction in which trypsin activates trypsinogen. If this occurs inside the pancreas, the inflammatory disorder pancreatitis develops (2Hegyi E. Sahin-Tóth M. Genetic risk in chronic pancreatitis: the trypsin-dependent pathway.Dig. Dis. Sci. 2017; 62: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As a defense mechanism against trypsinogen autoactivation and unwanted intrapancreatic trypsin activity, the pancreas secretes the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1), also known as the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor. This 6.2-kDa protein constitutes about 0.1 to 0.8% of the total protein in human pancreatic juice, which, in molar terms, corresponds to 2 to 13% of the trypsinogen content ([2Hegyi E. Sahin-Tóth M. Genetic risk in chronic pancreatitis: the trypsin-dependent pathway.Dig. Dis. Sci. 2017; 62: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar] and references therein). In 2000, Witt et al. (3Witt H. Luck W. Hennies H.C. Classen M. Kage A. Lass U. Landt O. Becker M. Mutations in the gene encoding the serine protease inhibitor, Kazal type 1 are associated with chronic pancreatitis.Nat.

The authors hypothesized that the variant causes impaired trypsin inhibition, which would result in elevated intrapancreatic trypsin activity and pancreatic injury. However, subsequent functional studies demonstrated that the N34S variant had no effect on the trypsin inhibitory activity, expression, or secretion of SPINK1 (5Kuwata K. Hirota M. Shimizu H.

Despite the accumulating negative evidence, some authors continued to propose that defective trypsin binding must underlie the pathogenic mechanism of the N34S variant and called for more detailed biochemical analysis (11Boulling A.

The discovery of additional SPINK1 variants associated with chronic pancreatitis confirmed that loss of function is indeed the mechanism responsible for the increased disease risk. Among these, the relatively frequent splice-site variant c.194+2T>C offered the best evidence, as the strong genetic association was complemented with conclusive functional data demonstrating exon skipping and loss of SPINK1 expression (10Kereszturi E.

Other loss-of-function variants reported include promoter variants, splice-site variants, nucleotide insertion or deletions, loss of the initiator methionine codon, signal peptide variants that reduce secretion, and missense variants that diminish SPINK1 secretion presumably because of misfolding and intracellular retention ([2Hegyi E. Sahin-Tóth M. Genetic risk in chronic pancreatitis: the trypsin-dependent pathway.Dig. Dis. Sci. 2017; 62: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar] and references therein). Remarkably, the large majority of SPINK1 variants seem to affect expression/secretion of the inhibitor rather than its trypsin inhibitory activity. To date, no systematic study analyzed whether any of the reported missense SPINK1 variants affect trypsin binding and inhibition. Human trypsins are post-translationally sulfated on Tyr154, and this modification alters the S2' binding subsite (Schechter–Berger nomenclature) (16Scheele G. Bartelt D. Bieger W.

Therefore, to obtain meaningful results, we performed SPINK1 binding studies with sulfated human trypsins. We included both cationic trypsin and anionic trypsin in the analysis, which constitute at least 95% of digestive trypsins. The minor isoform mesotrypsin is resistant to SPINK1 inhibition and was not studied for binding (20Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M.

First, we surveyed all reported missense SPINK1 variants and identified those with preserved secretion. Next, we purified these variants and performed quantitative binding studies with human trypsins. We found 19 missense variants reported in the literature that introduced single amino acid changes in the mature SPINK1 protein (Table 1). For this study, missense variants that affected the secretory signal peptide were excluded as these cannot alter binding properties of SPINK1 (22Király O. Boulling A. Witt H. Le Maréchal C. Chen J.M.

The results demonstrated that only seven of the 19 SPINK1 variants were secreted to the conditioned medium, including the newly tested variants K41N and I42M. All other variants, including P45S, V46D, and R65W, exhibited defective secretion, in all likelihood because of misfolding and intracellular retention (not shown).

We characterized secretion of the seven variants from transfected human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK 293T) cells using Western blotting (Fig. 2, A and B) and by measuring their trypsin inhibitory activity (Fig. 2C). For these experiments, we used SPINK1 constructs with and without a C-terminal 10His tag. SPINK1 in the conditioned medium was detected by a monoclonal anti-SPINK1 antibody and by an antibody against the His tag. When untagged SPINK1 constructs were analyzed by Western blotting, secretion of variants K41N and R65Q was somewhat decreased, that of P55S slightly increased, whereas all other variants were secreted at similar levels as the wildtype protein (Fig. 2A). Reduced secretion of the R65Q variant was described in prior studies (7Király O. Wartmann T. Sahin-Tóth M.

Western blotting of His-tagged SPINK1 constructs revealed a similar banding pattern, with the exception of variant R65Q, which showed improved secretion (Fig. 2B). Finally, we estimated SPINK1 levels by measuring the trypsin inhibitory activity of the conditioned medium (Fig. 2C). Relative SPINK1 concentrations in this assay showed good agreement with the Western blot results, with the sole exception of the untagged Q68R variant, which yielded higher than expected concentrations. We also noted that His tagging increased SPINK1 secretion by more than twofold. Taken the results together, we conclude that all seven SPINK1 variants studied are secreted well from transfected cells, and differences in secretion efficiency among the variants were relatively small. There are no X-ray structures of human SPINK1 bound to a human trypsin. Therefore, we built a model by superimposing the structure of native sulfated human cationic trypsin onto bovine chymotrypsinogen A complexed with an artificial K41Y,I42E SPINK1 variant, and we restored the reactive-site peptide bond residues to Lys41–Ile42 (25Collins J.

Examination of the amino acid side chains affected by the seven secreted SPINK1 variants indicated that mutations K41N and I42M alter the Lys41–Ile42 reactive-site peptide bond (positions P1–P1' in the Schechter–Berger numbering of scissile peptide bonds) and likely cause binding impairment (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the variants N34S, N37S, R65Q, and Q68R affect side chains that do not directly interact with trypsin and, therefore, are less likely to disturb inhibitor binding. Interestingly, in our putative model, the sulfate group on Tyr154 of trypsin lies in proximity of Pro55, suggesting that variant P55S may influence inhibitor binding to sulfated trypsins (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the Tyr43 side chain of SPINK1, which corresponds to the P2' position in the reactive loop, also appears to sterically clash with the sulfate group, suggesting that SPINK1 might bind weaker to sulfated trypsins than to nonsulfated trypsins. In the following experiments, we tested these predictions. Since the contentious question remains whether variant N34S alters inhibitor binding, we performed a comprehensive analysis of this variant. For these experiments, we used purified His-tagged SPINK1 proteins, as described in Experimental procedures section. Prior work demonstrated that inhibition of trypsin by wildtype SPINK1 and the N34S variant was comparable (5Kuwata K. Hirota M. Shimizu H. Nakae M. Nishihara S. Takimoto A. Mitsushima K. Kikuchi N.

Missense mutations in pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (SPINK1) cause intracellular retention and degradation.Gut. 2007; 56: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); however, these studies had technical limitations, as discussed later. First, we measured equilibrium binding to recombinant trypsins produced in Escherichia coli, which are not sulfated (Table 2). As shown in Figure 4, strong binding of wildtype SPINK1 to cationic and anionic trypsins was observed with KD values of 1.1 and 0.3 pM, respectively. Similar KD values (1.5 and 0.4 pM, respectively) were observed for the N34S variant too (Fig. 5). As predicted by our modeling, when binding was tested on sulfated trypsins that were purified from pancreatic juice, the KD values were considerably higher (Table 2). Thus, wildtype SPINK1 inhibited native cationic and anionic trypsins with KD values of 62.2 and 36.7 pM, respectively, whereas the N34S variant exhibited KD values of 32.3 and 16.7 pM (Figs. 4 and 5). The observations indicate that trypsin sulfation has a highly significant impact on inhibitor binding. Furthermore, the N34S variant inhibited trypsins slightly better, although this difference was within experimental error. Nonetheless, we can conclusively rule out that impaired trypsin inhibition might be caused by the N34S variant.Table 2Equilibrium dissociation constant (KD(eq)) values and association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants determined for wildtype and N34S variant SPINK1 inhibitors against nonsulfated (purified from Escherichia coli) and native sulfated (purified from pancreatic juice) human trypsinsSPINK1Hu1 (E. coli)Hu1-SO4 (native)Hu2 (E. coli)Hu2-SO4 (native)Wildtype kon (×106 M−1s−1)3.0 ± 0.33.5 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.1 koff (×10−6 s−1)8.2 ± 0.354.8 ± 6.20.5 ± 0.0418.1 ± 0.8 KD(calc) (pM)2.715.80.17.5 KD(eq) (pM)1.1 ± 0.262.2 ± 10.30.3 ± 0.0236.7 ± 2.3N34S kon (×106 M−1s−1)5.3 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.25.1 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.3 koff (×10-6 s−1)7.0 ± 0.645.0 ± 5.10.4 ± 0.0113.6 ± 0.5 KD(calc) (pM)1.316.40.14.4 KD(eq) (pM)1.5 ± 0.232.3 ± 2.90.4 ± 0.116.7 ± 0.8Hu1, nonsulfated human cationic trypsin; Hu2, nonsulfated human anionic trypsin; Hu1-SO4, native sulfated human cationic trypsin; Hu2-SO4, native sulfated human anionic trypsin; KD(calc), equilibrium dissociation constant calculated from the rate constants.Measurements were carried out as described under Experimental procedures section.

Measurements were carried out as described under Experimental procedures section. Data from at least three experiments were fitted globally. The error of the fit is indicated. In biological systems, rate of association or dissociation of the inhibitor may be more relevant functionally than the equilibrium binding strength. Therefore, we measured the kon and koff rate constants for wildtype and N34S SPINK1 against nonsulfated and sulfated human trypsins, as detailed in Experimental procedures section and illustrated in Figures S1 and S2. As shown in Table 2, similar values were obtained for the two inhibitors. When nonsulfated and sulfated trypsins were compared, SPINK1 associated slightly faster with the nonsulfated forms, whereas dissociation was significantly more rapid from the sulfated forms. Overall, the increased dissociation explains the higher KD values observed in equilibrium binding experiments. We calculated KD values from the rate constants and compared them with those obtained in the equilibrium binding assays. There was good agreement on nonsulfated trypsins where all constants were picomolar or lower. We note, however, that the experimental system used is not reliable in detecting differences in the subpicomolar KD range. With respect to sulfated and native trypsins, the calculated KD values were about two- to fivefold lower than those measured directly. This variation is within acceptable limits, given that two experimentally different methods were used to determine the KD values. SPINK1 is a so-called temporary inhibitor as it becomes inactivated over time and releases the active protease (28Laskowski M. Wu F.C. Temporary inhibition of trypsin.J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 204: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process starts with the cleavage of the SPINK1 reactive-site peptide bond by the bound trypsin followed by inactivating cleavages at Arg67–Gln68 and elsewhere by excess trypsin (20Szmola R.

Biochem. 1989; 106: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We compared the release of nonsulfated and sulfated human cationic trypsin from SPINK1 complexes and found that sulfated trypsin was released at a significantly higher rate than nonsulfated trypsin (Fig. 6A). This can be best explained by the more rapid dissociation of SPINK1 from sulfated trypsin (Table 2), which also underlies the elevated KD value of the interaction. Western blotting confirmed time-dependent SPINK1 degradation that paralleled the liberation of trypsin activity (Fig. 6B). As expected, the kinetics of temporary inhibition were similar for wildtype and N34S SPINK1, although we noted a slightly slower release for the N34S variant. An original observation of the present study was that sulfation of human trypsins on Tyr154 weakens binding of SPINK1 and facilitates its release from the complex. Since our nonsulfated and sulfated trypsin preparations were derived from different sources (E. coli versus pancreatic juice), we wanted to rule out any confounding effects this may have caused. Therefore, we expressed human cationic and anionic trypsins in HEK 293T cells in nonsulfated and sulfated forms, as described in Experimental procedures section. We purified the nonsulfated and sulfated trypsins from the conditioned medium and performed equilibrium binding assays with wildtype and N34S SPINK1. As shown in Table 3, the KD values were consistently higher against sulfated trypsins versus nonsulfated trypsins, confirming the weakening effect of trypsin sulfation on SPINK1 binding. Interestingly, when compared with values obtained on trypsin preparations from E. coli and pancreatic juice (Table 2), the KD values of nonsulfated trypsins from HEK 293T cells were somewhat higher, whereas those of sulfated trypsins from HEK 293T cells were mostly lower. As a result, the negative effect of trypsin sulfatio"

To become activated, CDKs require both regulatory phosphorylation and binding of a cognate cyclin subunit. We studied the activation process of the G1/S kinase Cdk2 in solution and developed a thermodynamic model that describes the allosteric coupling between regulatory phosphorylation, cyclin binding and inhibitor binding. The results explain why monomeric Cdk2 lacks activity despite sampling an active-like state, reveal that regulatory phosphorylation enhances allosteric coupling with the cyclin subunit and show that this coupling underlies differential recognition of Cdk2 and Cdk4 inhibitors. We identify an allosteric hub that has diverged between Cdk2 and Cdk4 and show that this hub controls the strength of allosteric coupling. The altered allosteric wiring of Cdk4 leads to compromised activity toward generic peptide substrates and comparative specialization toward its primary substrate retinoblastoma (RB)."

Various recombinant monoclonal antibodies of human origin that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection have been isolated from convalescent patients and will be applied as therapies and prophylaxis. However, the need for dedicated monoclonal antibodies suitable for molecular pathology research is not fully addressed. Here, we produced six mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibodies that not only exhibit robust performance in immunoassays including western blotting, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation, but also demonstrate neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection to VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Due to their mouse origin, our monoclonal antibodies are compatible with the experimental immunoassay setups commonly used in basic molecular biology research laboratories, providing a useful tool for future research. Furthermore, in the hope of applying the antibodies of clinical setting, we determined the variable regions of the antibodies and used them to produce recombinant human/mouse chimeric antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3126358253,"Introduction This study investigates the oral health-seeking behaviour of households and its influence on demand for dental caries treatment services in Enugu state Nigeria. Methods A quantitative descriptive cross-sectional study was used to explore the oral health seeking pattern of 378 urban and 348 rural household respondents in Enugu state Nigeria. The study explored dental caries treatment-seeking, oral health behavior of respondents using the three dynamics of the Andersen and Newman health utilization model; predisposing, enabling and need factors. Findings Recommendations from community members (48.9%), severity of disease (22.1%), and cost of treatment (19.4%) all influenced where oral healthcare was first sought. Gender and type of occupation, influenced positive oral health-seeking behavior (p&lt;0.05). The least poor socioeconomic status (SES) group, sought dental treatment in the private dental clinics, while the very poor and most poor SES groups used traditional healers, home treatment and patent medicine dealers more. Dental fillings and extractions were generally the most accessed treatment options for dental caries. The tendency for all the SES groups (especially the least poor), to choose tooth extraction more as a treatment option for dental caries was influenced by the oral health awareness level of respondents and the cost of dental fillings. (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion The findings suggest that interventions to create increased oral health awareness targeted at education on preventive strategies, appropriate time and place to seek oral health care and dental caries treatment, as well devising and implementing health financing options such as dental insurance would enable individuals to seek appropriate treatment for dental caries on time. In addition, it will reduce the proportion of people visiting unorthodox healthcare providers for their oral health problems or choosing cheaper but inappropriate treatment options."

In human cells, SL levels are regulated by ceramide synthase (CerS) enzymes that produce ceramides, which can be converted to SMs, hexosylceramides, and other SLs. In many cell types, CerS2, which catalyzes the synthesis of very long chain ceramides, is the major CerS. We have examined how CerS2 deficiency affects the assembly and infectivity of HIV-1. As expected, we observed that very long chain ceramide, hexosylceramide, and SM were reduced in CerS2 knockout cells. CerS2 deficiency did not affect HIV-1 assembly or the incorporation of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein into virus particles, but it reduced the infectivites of viruses produced in the CerS2-deficient cells. The reduced viral infection levels were dependent on HIV-1 Env, since HIV-1 particles that were pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein did not exhibit reductions in infectivity. Moreover, cell–cell fusion assays demonstrated that the functional defect of HIV-1 Env in CerS2-deficient cells was independent of other viral proteins.

In particular, CerS5 and CerS6 have short acyl chain specificities (C14 and C16), CerS1 and CerS4 have long chain specificities (C18 and C20), whereas CerS2 and CerS3 have very long chain specificities (C20–C30) (21Levy M.

We have examined the effects of knocking out CerS2 on the assembly and infectivity of HIV-1. Lipid analyses showed that relative to WT cells, CerS2−/− cells had moderately reduced levels of long chain Cer species and greatly reduced levels of long chain SMs and hexosylceramide (HexCer) lipids. Importantly, while CerS2−/− cells supported the efficient assembly and release of viruses containing normal amounts of HIV-1 Env proteins, viruses so obtained were a third as infectious as those produced in WT cells. Similar results were obtained with HIV-1 virions carrying an Env protein cytoplasmic domain deletion (ΔCT; (17Checkley M.A. Luttge B.G. Freed E.O.

Cell–cell fusion assay results mimicked virus infection results, indicating that the Env protein defect in CerS2−/− cells was independent of other virally encoded constituents. Overall, our results demonstrate that the HIV-1 Env binding and/or fusion functions are dependent on membrane SL compositions. To monitor the effects of CerS2 mutations on cellular lipid compositions, we performed lipidomic analyses on WT human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells (29DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C.

Because of this, we anticipated that CerS2−/− HEK293T cells might show reduced levels of Cer-derived SLs and, in particular, very long chain SLs. For our analyses, lipids extracted from WT and CerS2−/− HEK293T cells were analyzed by LC/MS. In all, we identified 366 lipid species for which comparisons could be made (Table S1). These included phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, PSs, phosphatidylglycerols, diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, cholesterol ester, cardiolipins, Cers, SMs, and HexCers. Our results are visualized as volcano plots (Fig. 2), in which X-axes indicate log2 fold change of mutant/WT, and Y-axes indicate −log10 adjusted significance (p) values. Of the lipid classes, levels of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, PSs, and cardiolipins were only marginally affected in the CerS2−/− cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols were slightly increased, and cholesterol ester and phosphatidylglycerols were slightly decreased. Interestingly, levels of shorter chain Cer species (d18:1/16:0 and d18:1/18:0) were increased in CerS2−/− cells, whereas the longest chain species (d18:1/23:0, d18:1/24:0, and d18:1/24:1) were decreased: these results are consistent with the role of CerS2 in very long chain Cer synthesis (21Levy M.

However, the most significant SL reductions in CerS2−/− cells were very long chain HexCer (d18:1/22:0, d18:1/23:0, d18:1/24:0, and d18:1/24:1) and SM (d18:1/22:1, d18:1/24:0, d18:1/24:1 [or d18:2/24:0], d18:1/25:0, and d18:1/26:0) species.

To examine how a deficiency in CerS2 might affect HIV-1 assembly, release, and replication, we transfected WT and CerS2−/− HEK293T cells with the full-length NL4-3 (33Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. Production of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated retrovirus in human and nonhuman cells transfected with an infectious molecular clone.J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) WT HIV-1 proviral plasmid and monitored particle production, Env levels in virus particles, and infection efficiencies. As shown in Figure 3A, cell lysate samples immunoblotted with an antibody against the Gag capsid (CA) protein showed similar staining patterns of PrGag, CA, and processing intermediates. Virus samples immunoblotted with the anti-CA antibody yielded the expected enrichment of CA over PrGag, with roughly equivalent levels of each species detected in samples produced from WT versus CerS2−/− cells (Fig. 3B). Virus samples immunoblotted with an antibody to the transmembrane (gp41) portion of Env also appeared similar (Fig. 3C), with appreciably higher levels of gp41 than the full-length unprocessed Env protein (gp160). Quantitation of immunoblots from 10 independent pairwise transfections allowed us to compare WT and CerS2−/− HEK293T virus release levels (defined as viral versus cellular Gag levels), Gag-normalized Env levels in virions (Env/Gag), and ratios of gp41 to gp160 (41/160) in virions (Fig. 4A). As shown, no significant differences in these parameters were observed, indicating that CerS2 deficiency had little effect on HIV-1 assembly efficiencies, Env incorporation levels, or Env processing. To assay virus infectivities, viruses produced from WT and mutant cells were used to infect TZM-bl cells, which respond to HIV-1 infection, integration, and expression via the transactivation of their Tat-inducible β-galactosidase (β-gal) genes (34Platt E.J.

Remarkably, we found a consistent 70% reduction in Gag-normalized infectivity (inf/Gag) levels from viruses produced in CerS2−/− cells versus WT cells (Fig. 4A).

Because of this, we also subjected an NL4-3 HIV-1 variant that carries a CT deletion (ΔCT) to our analyses. Although our first experiment suggested that ΔCT viruses might be slightly less sensitive than WT HIV-1 to CerS2 depletion, subsequent repeats showed that ΔCT viruses produced in CerS2−/− cells were as impaired for infectivity as WT viruses (Fig. 4B). We also tested two additional HIV-1 Env CT mutants: one of these was an Env P714L mutant (also called P203L (14Waheed A.A. Ablan S.D. Roser J.D. Sowder R.C. Schaffner C.P. Chertova E. Freed E.O.

Alfadhli A. Barklis R.L. Barklis E. Replication of HIV-1 envelope protein cytoplasmic domain variants in permissive and restrictive cells.Virology. 2019; 538: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These variants also showed significant infectivity reductions for viruses produced in mutant versus WT HEK293T cells (CerS2−/− P714L inf/Gag = 6% WT cells; CerS2−/− 716Ins-R∗ = 30 ± 11% WT cells). Overall, these results indicated that infectivity defects were independent of the Env CT. The aforementioned data were consistent with an inhibition of receptor binding or virus–cell fusion or with subsequent steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. As a means to narrow down possibilities, we performed our analyses with HIV-1 virions that were pseudotyped with the VSV G. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the VSV G protein can replace the function of HIV-1 Env and mediate the efficient binding, fusion, and entry of HIV-1 into target cells using alternate receptors and entry mechanisms (27Johnson M.C.

In spinal neurons, sustained endosomal signaling of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) mediates nociception, as demonstrated in models of acute and neuropathic pain. An NK1R antagonist, Spantide I (Span), conjugated to cholestanol (Span-Chol), accumulates in endosomes, inhibits endosomal NK1R signaling, and causes prolonged antinociception. However, the extent to which the Chol-anchor influences long-term location and activity is poorly understood. Herein, we used fluorescent correlation spectroscopy and targeted biosensors to characterize Span-Chol over time. The Chol-anchor increased local concentration of probe at the plasma membrane. Over time we observed an increase in NK1R-binding affinity and more potent inhibition of NK1R-mediated calcium signaling. Span-Chol, but not Span, caused a persistent decrease in NK1R recruitment of β-arrestin and receptor internalization to early endosomes. Using targeted biosensors, we mapped the relative inhibition of NK1R signaling as the receptor moved into the cell. Span selectively inhibited cell surface signaling, whereas Span-Chol partitioned into endosomal membranes and blocked endosomal signaling. In a preclinical model of pain, Span-Chol caused prolonged antinociception (>9 h), which is attributable to a three-pronged mechanism of action: increased local concentration at membranes, a prolonged decrease in NK1R endocytosis, and persistent inhibition of signaling from endosomes.

Drug discovery efforts typically target GPCRs at the cell surface, and as a consequence, many drugs targeting GPCRs are not designed to cross the plasma membrane. This inability to effectively engage intracellular GPCRs might explain why some drugs with high efficacy in cell-based assays of plasma membrane signaling fail in clinical trials. For the GPCR for substance P (SP), the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), multiple NK1R antagonists have failed in clinical trials of chronic neurological diseases, including pain (11Dionne R.A. Max M.B.

Activation of the NK1R causes two spatially and temporally distinct rounds of signaling (Fig. S1). At the cell surface, SP-bound NK1R rapidly activates Gαq G proteins to increase Ca2+ mobilization, protein kinase C (PKC) activity, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation in the vicinity of the plasma membrane (5Jensen D.D.

Stimulation of the NK1R also leads to transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to increase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity in the cytoplasm.

We have previously assessed the potential for drug delivery strategies to locally deliver NK1R antagonists to endosomes. This includes pH-responsive nanoparticles that deliver and release the NK1R antagonist aprepitant directly into the endosomes (17Ramirez-Garcia P.D. Retamal J.S. Shenoy P. Imlach W. Sykes M.

Both of these approaches improved drug efficacy in preclinical models of pain (2–5-fold more effective antinociception, 2–4-fold longer duration of action compared with free drug) (5Jensen D.D.

Nanotechnol. 2019; 14: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The localized delivery of an NK1R antagonist to endosomes using nanoparticles is a selective approach that bypasses any effects on receptors at the cell surface. In contrast, lipid-anchored NK1R antagonists first partition into the plasma membrane, before they are trafficked to endosomes (5Jensen D.D. Lieu T. Halls M.L. Veldhuis N.A. Imlach W.L. Mai Q.N. Poole D.P. Quach T. Aurelio L. Conner J. Herenbrink C.K. Barlow N. Simpson J.S. Scanlon M.J. Graham B. et al.Neurokinin 1 receptor signaling in endosomes mediates sustained nociception and is a viable therapeutic target for prolonged pain relief.Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9: eaal3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that lipid-anchored antagonists also affect the signaling and trafficking of plasma membrane-localized NK1R, in addition to their later antagonism of endosomal receptors. This dual antagonism—initial blockade of plasma membrane receptors during partitioning into the plasma membrane and then prolonged blockade of the pathophysiologically relevant signal from endosomes—could enhance therapeutic efficacy. In the current investigation, we used live cell imaging and biophysical approaches to assess NK1R signaling and trafficking in subcellular compartments, in conjunction with behavioral assays of nociception to investigate the mechanisms by which a cholestanol-anchored antagonist, Spantide I (Span-Chol), inhibits endosomal signaling. We used a cholestanol-anchored fluorescent probe (Cy5-Chol) to model the lipid-dependent translocation of the antagonist. We observed that the lipid anchor allows an initial enrichment of probe concentration at the plasma membrane, which correlates with an increased antagonist potency at proximal signaling pathways (i.e., Ca2+ mobilization). The lipid-anchored antagonist also inhibits cell surface NK1R-β-arrestin recruitment and NK1R endocytosis. Over time, Cy5-Chol travels from the plasma membrane to early and late endosomes. This movement deeper into the endosomal network correlates with inhibition of endosomal-selective NK1R signaling pathways (5Jensen D.D. Lieu T. Halls M.L. Veldhuis N.A. Imlach W.L. Mai Q.N. Poole D.P. Quach T. Aurelio L. Conner J. Herenbrink C.K. Barlow N. Simpson J.S. Scanlon M.J.

Med. 2017; 9: eaal3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) by Span-Chol, including sustained cytosolic cAMP and cytosolic PKC activity. Consistent with these findings, the lipid-anchored antagonist has long-lasting antinociceptive actions in preclinical models of pain (>9 h). We find that lipid anchors increase the local membrane concentration of GPCR antagonists, cause inhibition of receptor trafficking from the plasma membrane, and prolong the inhibition of signaling from endosomes. This three-pronged mechanism allows lipid-anchored antagonists to very effectively target endosomally derived GPCR signaling pathways of pathophysiological importance. Inspired by prior studies using lipid–drug conjugates (18Rajendran L. Schneider A. Schlechtingen G. Weidlich S. Ries J. Braxmeier T. Schwille P. Schulz J.B. Schroeder C. Simons M. Jennings G.

For the cargo we used Cyanine 5 (Cy5), to generate a fluorescent reporter of lipid-anchor location (Cy5-Chol), or the NK1R antagonist, Spantide I, to generate a lipid-anchored antagonist (Span-Chol) (Fig. S2). We also generated control probes including a nonlipidated fluorescent probe (ethyl-ester group, PEG linker, Cy5; Cy5-OEt) and a lipid anchor control probe (cholestanol group, PEG linker, biotin; Chol). Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) enables measurement of the concentrations of fluorescent molecules within a small defined volume (<0.2 fl) (20Briddon S.J. Hill S.J.

Biol. 2012; 19: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We used this approach to determine the concentration of Cy5 probes (Cy5-Chol or the control, Cy5-OEt) in the extracellular fluid immediately above the plasma membrane and at increasing distances above the cell (30–200 μm). We chose the Cy5 probes as the simplest example of how a lipid anchor could affect the plasma membrane concentration of a cargo, independent of any receptor-dependent effects on ligand distribution (22Gherbi K. Briddon S.J. Charlton S.J. Micro-pharmacokinetics: Quantifying local drug concentration at live cell membranes.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous studies (5Jensen D.D. Lieu T. Halls M.L. Veldhuis N.A. Imlach W.L. Mai Q.N. Poole D.P. Quach T. Aurelio L. Conner J. Herenbrink C.K. Barlow N. Simpson J.S. Scanlon M.J.

Med. 2017; 9: eaal3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), brightfield and fluorescence confocal imaging confirmed that Cy5-Chol rapidly incorporated into the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A), but Cy5-OEt remained in extracellular fluid (Fig. 1B). We then used FCS to quantify the concentration of Cy5 fluorescence at the plasma membrane of cells incubated with a nominal concentration of probe (10 nM). The concentration of Cy5-Chol in the extracellular fluid at 5 μm above the plasma membrane was 23.8 ± 7.1 nM, which decreased more than fourfold to 5.6 ± 1.4 nM at 30 μm (mean ± SEM from n = 4) (Fig. 1, C and E). In contrast, the measured concentration of Cy5-OEt was 6.5 ± 1.1 nM at 5 μm above the plasma membrane, which increased more than threefold to 21.8 ± 3.8 nM at 200 μm (mean ± SEM from n = 4) (Fig. 1, D and E). A comparison of probe concentrations at increasing distances (5 μm intervals) above the plasma membrane suggested that there was an enrichment of Cy5-Chol proximal to the plasma membrane, while the Cy5-OEt reporter molecule could freely diffuse through the extracellular fluid (Fig. 1E). Therefore, the addition of a lipid anchor results in an enhanced association of a probe with cell membranes. This creates a high local concentration of probe at the cell surface. To determine whether the addition of a lipid anchor influences the affinity and potency of an NK1R antagonist, we compared unconjugated (“free”) Spantide I (Span) and Span-Chol. A high-content imaging competition binding assay was used to evaluate the capacity of these antagonists to disrupt the binding of SP labeled with fluorescent tetramethylrhodamine (SP-TAMRA) to the NK1R stably transfected in HEK293 cells. Cells were analyzed using an established granularity algorithm to provide a measure of total cell binding (includes both cell surface and intracellular) (21Stoddart L.A. Vernall A.J. Denman J.L.

Direct visualisation of internalization of the adenosine A3 receptor and localization with arrestin3 using a fluorescent agonist.Neuropharmacology. 2015; 98: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We assessed antagonist affinity at two time points following antagonist addition: 30 min, when FCS data show Cy5-Chol enrichment at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1); and 4 h, when Span-Chol accumulates, and is pharmacologically active, within endosomal compartments (5Jensen D.D. Lieu T. Halls M.L. Veldhuis N.A. Imlach W.L. Mai Q.N. Poole D.P. Quach T. Aurelio L. Conner J. Herenbrink C.K. Barlow N. Simpson J.S. Scanlon M.J. Graham B. et al.Neurokinin 1 receptor signaling in endosomes mediates sustained nociception and is a viable therapeutic target for prolonged pain relief.Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9: eaal3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To assess competition binding after 30 min, HEK-NK1R cells were coincubated with an EC50 concentration of SP-TAMRA (0.5 nM) and increasing concentrations of Span or Span-Chol and equilibrated for 30 min. The affinity of Span-Chol and Span for NK1R was similar with pIC50 values of 6.28 ± 0.09 and 5.99 ± 0.13, respectively (Fig. 2A). Therefore, peptide modification by attachment of a PEG12 linker and cholestanol anchor does not diminish the affinity of Spantide for the NK1R. To assess ligand binding after 4 h, HEK-NK1R cells were preincubated with antagonist for 3.5 h, then with SP-TAMRA for a further 30 min (4 h total). The affinity of Span for the NK1R was significantly reduced compared with that of Span-Chol (pIC50 5.55 ± 0.17 vs 6.50 ± 0.12, p = 0.0018, unpaired t-test) (Fig. 2B). However, there was no significant change in the relative affinities of Span or Span-Chol for the NK1R over time (p = 0.1121 and p = 0.6378, respectively; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). This suggests that the addition of a lipid anchor improves the kinetic properties of Span by sustaining its ability to compete with SP-TAMRA at the NK1R over a 4 h period. Our previous studies indicated no difference in stability of these ligands in spinal cord membranes (5Jensen D.D. Lieu T. Halls M.L. Veldhuis N.A. Imlach W.L. Mai Q.N. Poole D.P. Quach T. Aurelio L. Conner J. Herenbrink C.K. Barlow N. Simpson J.S. Scanlon M.J.

Med. 2017; 9: eaal3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that this apparent improvement in affinity of Span-Chol for the NK1R is due to the accumulation of Span-Chol in endosomes, allowing Span-Chol to access both plasma membrane and endosomal pools of NK1R. To determine if lipid conjugation influenced the potency of Span, we compared the ability of Span and Span-Chol to inhibit SP-stimulated Ca2+ signaling in HEK-NK1R cells at different time points after addition. In initial experiments, HEK-NK1R cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of Span or Span-Chol for 30 min, prior to challenge with an EC80 concentration of SP (1 nM). Ca2+ transients were measured for 90 s poststimulation. Preincubation of cells with Span or Span-Chol caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ flux (Fig. 2C). A comparison of the pIC50 values of Span and Span-Chol (4.87 ± 0.33 and 6.25 ± 0.19, respectively) revealed a significant increase in the potency of the lipidated antagonist (p = 0.0112). This is consistent with FCS experiments (Fig. 1) and may be due to the lipid anchoring of the antagonist to the plasma membrane, thereby effectively increasing the local concentration of the antagonist near the receptor even at acute time periods (24Vauquelin G.

While lipid-anchored fluorescent probes initially partition into the plasma membrane, they are then quickly trafficked into endosomal compartments (5Jensen D.D. Lieu T. Halls M.L. Veldhuis N.A.

Med. 2017; 9: eaal3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As such, the continuous removal of lipidated antagonists from the plasma membrane by constitutive endocytosis could affect the relative potency of Span-Chol compared with soluble Span over time. To assess this possibility, we compared continuous exposure to the antagonists for 4 h to a “pulsed” administration whereby the cells were preincubated with antagonist for 30 min, washed to remove any excess ligand, and then left at 37°C for 3.5 h (4 h total). In both protocols, cells were challenged with 1 nM SP 4 h after the initial antagonist addition. There was no change in the pIC50 of the antagonists when the cells were continuously incubated with Span or Span-Chol for 4 h (5.11 ± 0.76 and 6.36 ± 0.17, respectively) compared with the 30 min preincubation (Fig. 2D). After pulsed administration, only Span-Chol retained its ability to antagonize SP-stimulated Ca2+ signaling at 4 h (pIC50 6.15 ± 0.11) (Fig. 2D). This is likely due to the wash step (after the initial 30 min incubation with antagonist) decreasing the available concentration of free Span in the extracellular fluid. In contrast, the potency of Span-Chol was not lost following the wash, confirming that lipidation causes an increased association of the antagonist with the cell membrane. Notably, the potency of Span-Chol was sustained over 4 h despite the increasing internalization of lipid-anchored probes over time (5Jensen D.D. Lieu T. Halls M.L. Veldhuis N.A. Imlach W.L. Mai Q.N.

Whilst we find an inverted asymmetry in the volatility of Bitcoin, its magnitude changes over time, and recently, it has become small. This asymmetric pattern of volatility also exists in higher frequency returns. Other measurements, such as kurtosis, skewness, average, serial correlation, and multifractal degree, also change over time. Thus, we argue that properties of the Bitcoin market are mostly time dependent. We examine efficiency-related measures: the Hurst exponent, multifractal degree, and kurtosis. We find that when these measures represent that the market is more efficient, the volatility asymmetry weakens. For the recent Bitcoin market, both efficiency-related measures and the volatility asymmetry prove that the market becomes more efficient."
https://openalex.org/W3126379572,"Bcl-2-associated athanogen-6 (BAG6) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein involved in protein quality control. We previously demonstrated that BAG6 is essential for autophagy by regulating the intracellular localization of the acetyltransferase EP300, and thus, modifying accessibility to its substrates (TP53 in the nucleus and autophagy-related proteins in the cytoplasm). Here, we investigated BAG6 localization and function in the cytoplasm. First, we demonstrated that BAG6 is localized in the mitochondria. Specifically, BAG6 is expressed in the mitochondrial matrix under basal conditions, and translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane after mitochondrial depolarization with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine, a mitochondrial uncoupler that induces mitophagy. In SW480 cells, the deletion of BAG6 expression abrogates its ability to induce mitophagy and PINK1 accumulation. On the reverse, its ectopic expression in LoVo colon cancer cells, which do not express endogenous BAG6, reduces the size of the mitochondria, induces mitophagy, leads to the activation of the PINK1/PARKIN pathway and to the phospho-ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins. Finally, BAG6 contains two LIR (LC3-interacting Region) domains specifically found in receptors for selective autophagy and responsible for the interaction with LC3 and for autophagosome selectivity. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that BAG6 requires wild-type LIRs domains for its ability to stimulate mitophagy. In conclusion, we propose that BAG6 is a novel mitophagy receptor or adaptor that induces PINK1/PARKIN signaling and mitophagy in a LIR-dependent manner."

Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate possible findings on chest CT of patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory syndromes and positive epidemiological factors for COVID-19 infection and to correlate them with the course of the disease. In this sense, it is also expected to develop specific machine learning algorithm for this purpose, through pulmonary segmentation, which can predict possible prognostic factors, through more accurate results. Our alternative hypothesis is that the machine learning model based on clinical, radiological and epidemiological data will be able to predict the severity prognosis of patients infected with COVID-19. We will perform a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study to obtain a large number of cases in a short period of time, for better study validation. Our convenience sample (at least 20 cases for each outcome) will be collected in each center considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We will evaluate patients who enter the hospital with clinical signs and symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome, from March to May 2020. We will include individuals with signs and symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome, with positive epidemiological history for COVID-19, who have performed a chest computed tomography. We will assess chest CT of these patients and to correlate them with the course of the disease. Primary outcomes:1) Time to hospital discharge; 2) Length of stay in the ICU; 3) orotracheal intubation;4) Development of Acute Respiratory Discomfort Syndrome. Secondary outcomes:1) Sepsis; 2) Hypotension or cardiocirculatory dysfunction requiring the prescription of vasopressors or inotropes; 3) Coagulopathy; 4) Acute Myocardial Infarction; 5) Acute Renal Insufficiency; 6) Death. We will use the AUC and F1-score of these algorithms as the main metrics, and we hope to identify algorithms capable of generalizing their results for each specified primary and secondary outcome."

However, the function of BRs in cold tolerance in cotton has not been explored. In this study, cotton seedlings were treated with five concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/L) of 24-Epibrassinolide (EBR) at 4°C. We measured the electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, proline content, and net photosynthesis rate (Pn) of the seedlings, which showed that EBR treatment increased cold tolerance in cotton in a dose-dependent manner, and that 0.2 mg/L is an optimum concentration for enhancing cold tolerance. The function of EBR in cotton cotyledons was investigated in the control 0 mg/L (Cold+water) and 0.2 mg/L (Cold+EBR) treatments using RNA-Seq. A total of 4,001 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 2,591 up-regulated genes and 1,409 down-regulated genes were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) and biochemical pathway enrichment analyses showed that EBR is involved in the genetic information process, secondary metabolism, and also inhibits abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene (ETH) signal transduction. In this study, physiological experiments showed that EBR can increase cold tolerance in cotton seedlings, and the comprehensive RNA-seq data shed light on the mechanisms through which EBR increases cold tolerance in cotton seedlings."
https://openalex.org/W3127744119,"Glycosylation, the most common posttranslational modification of proteins, is a stepwise process that relies on tight regulation of subcellular glycosyltransferase location to control the addition of each monosaccharide. Glycosyltransferases primarily reside and function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus; whether and how they traffic beyond the Golgi, how this trafficking is controlled, and how it impacts glycosylation remain unclear. Our previous work identified a connection between N-glycosylation and Rab11, a key player in the post-Golgi transport that connects recycling endosomes and other compartments. To learn more about the specific role of Rab11, we knocked down Rab11 in HeLa cells. Our findings indicate that Rab11 knockdown results in a dramatic enhancement in the sialylation of N-glycans. Structural analyses of glycans using lectins and LC-MS revealed that α2,3-sialylation is selectively enhanced, suggesting that an α2,3-sialyltransferase that catalyzes the sialyation of glycoproteins is activated or upregulated as the result of Rab11 knockdown. ST3GAL4 is the major α2,3-sialyltransferase that acts on N-glycans; we demonstrated that the localization of ST3GAL4, but not the levels of its mRNA, protein, or donor substrate, was altered by Rab11 depletion. In knockdown cells, ST3GAL4 is densely distributed in the trans-Golgi network, compared with the wider distribution in the Golgi and in other peripheral puncta in control cells, whereas the α2,6-sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 is predominantly localized to the Golgi regardless of Rab11 knockdown. This indicates that Rab11 may negatively regulate α2,3-sialylation by transporting ST3GAL4 to post-Golgi compartments (PGCs), which is a novel mechanism of glycosyltransferase regulation.

Glycosylation is one of the most common posttranslational modifications in eukaryotes and has a major role in regulating the functions of glycoproteins and cells, including folding, activity, cell adhesion, and communication (1Varki A. Biological roles of glycans.Glycobiology. 2017; 27: 3-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Glycan structures are diverse and dynamically change to enable complex multicellular systems such as immunity, the nervous system, and development (2Moremen K.W. Tiemeyer M. Nairn A.V.

In addition, undesirable changes in glycan structures cause various diseases, including cancer and diabetes (5Pinho S.S. Reis C.A. Glycosylation in cancer: Mechanisms and clinical implications.Nat.

Therefore, for a further understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of glycans, elucidating how glycan structures are altered is a pivotal issue. Among various types of glycosylation, N-glycosylation is highly conserved in mammals (8Stanley P. Taniguchi N. Aebi M. N-glycans.in: Essentials of Glycobiology [Internet]. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2017Google Scholar). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the common form of oligosaccharide is attached to an asparagine residue in the consensus sequence (Asn-X-Ser/Thr, X is except for Pro) (9Cherepanova N. Shrimal S. Gilmore R. N-linked glycosylation and homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 41: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Harada Y. Ohkawa Y. Kizuka Y. Taniguchi N. Oligosaccharyltransferase: A gatekeeper of health and tumor progression.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). During the transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, the attached N-glycans are processed and modified by the stepwise action of various glycosyltransferases (11Nagae M. Yamaguchi Y. Taniguchi N. Kizuka Y. 3D structure and function of glycosyltransferases involved in N-glycan maturation.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 1-23Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To date, approximately 180 human glycosyltransferases have been identified, and their expression levels impact the biosynthesis of protein-, cell-type-, and disease-specific glycans (12Moremen K.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Emerging structural insights into glycosyltransferase-mediated synthesis of glycans.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In particular, the actions of glycosyltransferases localized in the Golgi are responsible for the structural diversity of N-glycans, and the expression level of the responsible glycosyltransferase is considered to be a primary factor for the biosynthesis of a certain glycan. In addition to the expression level, the localization of glycosyltransferases is also a major factor for glycan biosynthesis. In the biosynthetic pathways of glycans, Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases often share an acceptor glycan and can compete with each other (13Koyota S. Ikeda Y. Miyagawa S. Ihara H. Koma M. Honke K. Shirakura R. Taniguchi N.

To the contrary, some glycosyltransferases form heterocomplexes in order to cooperate with each other (15Seko A. Yamashita K. Characterization of a novel galactose β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (β3Gn-T8): The complex formation of β3Gn-T2 and β3Gn-T8 enhances enzymatic activity.Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Akasaka-Manya K.

Therefore, each glycosyltransferase should be trafficked to its own appropriate place to maintain the glycan profiles in cells (18Zhao W. Chen T.L.L. Vertel B.M. Colley K.J. The CMP-sialic acid transporter is localized in the medial-trans Golgi and possesses two specific endoplasmic reticulum export motifs in its carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail.J. Biol.

Indeed, the abnormal transport of glycosyltransferases significantly impacts glycan biosynthesis and causes the expression of aberrant glycans. For example, the deletion of Golgi scaffold proteins, Giantin or GM130, leads to the mislocalization of glycosyltransferases and impaired glycosylation (20Petrosyan A. Ali M.F. Cheng P.W. Glycosyltransferase-specific Golgi-targeting mechanisms.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 37621-37627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, defects in the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex comprised of COG proteins and their interacting partners (Rab GTPases, golgins, and SNAREs) also lead to aberrant glycosylation probably due to the impaired transport of glycosyltransferases (21Shestakova A. Zolov S. Lupashin V.

Bridging the gap between glycosylation and vesicle traffic.Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 4: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the appropriate trafficking of glycosyltransferases for glycan expression, the mechanisms responsible for their regulation remain largely unclear. It is particularly noteworthy that little is known concerning whether and how glycosyltransferases are trafficked to the post-Golgi compartments (PGCs), including early/late/recycling endosomes and the plasma membrane (PM). In our previous report, to our surprise, we found that the N-glycosylation of several glycoproteins is altered in mutant mice lacking Rab11a (23Sobajima T. Yoshimura S.I. Iwano T. Kunii M. Watanabe M. Atik N. Mushiake S. Morii E. Koyama Y. Miyoshi E. Harada A. Rab11a is required for apical protein localisation in the intestine.Biol. Open. 2015; 4: 86-94Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that is involved in vesicular trafficking via recycling endosomes (24Welz T. Wellbourne-Wood J. Kerkhoff E. Orchestration of cell surface proteins by Rab11.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In mammals, the Rab GTPase family is composed of at least 60 members, and they function to regulate intracellular membrane transport (25Hutagalung A.H. Novick P.J. Role of Rab GTPases in membrane traffic and cell physiology.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 119-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Although Rab proteins that are involved in trafficking between the ER and the Golgi are likely to be committed to the transport of glycosyltransferases (26Yamane J. Kubo A. Nakayama K. Yuba-Kubo A. Katsuno T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Functional involvement of TMF/ARA160 in Rab6-dependent retrograde membrane traffic.Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3472-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the involvement of Rab11 proteins (Rab11a and Rab11b) in glycosylation has not been elucidated. Rab11 is frequently used as a marker of recycling endosomes and functions in intracellular recycling pathways, cholesterol transport, and autophagosome formation (27Campa C.C. Hirsch E.

Rab11 regulates recycling through the pericentriolar recycling endosome.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that the pathological roles of Rab11 proteins are involved in Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and cancer (31Bhuin T. Roy J.K. Rab11 in disease progression.Int. J. Mol. Cell. Med. 2015; 4: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar), details of the in vivo physiological functions of Rab11 proteins remain poorly understood. Since Rab11a systemic knockout mice are embryonically lethal (32Yu S. Yehia G. Wang J. Stypulkowski E. Sakamori R. Jiang P. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Tran T.S. Bonder E.M. Guo W. Gao N. Global ablation of the mouse Rab11a gene impairs early embryogenesis and matrix metalloproteinase secretion.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 32030-32043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we generated intestine-specific Rab11a knockout (IKO) mice and used them in an attempt to elucidate the physiological roles of Rab11a in the gut (23Sobajima T. Yoshimura S.I. Iwano T. Kunii M. Watanabe M. Atik N. Mushiake S. Morii E. Koyama Y. Miyoshi E. Harada A. Rab11a is required for apical protein localisation in the intestine.Biol. Open. 2015; 4: 86-94Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to the impaired trafficking of apical proteins to the apical membrane in the IKO mice, we discovered that the mobility of several glycoproteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel was commonly shifted up in the mutant mice. Furthermore, the mobility shifts were canceled when the N-glycans were removed by treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), strongly suggesting that abnormal N-glycosylation is caused by a Rab11a deficiency. However, the issue of how Rab11 is involved in the N-glycosylation pathway is not completely clear. In this study, to reveal the mechanisms by which Rab11 regulates N-glycosylation, we investigated the detailed changes in N-glycans and glycosyltransferases in Rab11-knockdown HeLa cells. Using lectin blotting and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses, we found that the extent of sialylation, particularly α2,3-sialylation, is strikingly increased in Rab11-knockdown cells, which was likely caused by the accumulation of the α2,3-sialyltransferase ST3GAL4 in the Golgi. Our findings suggest the existence of a pathway in which this glycosyltransferase is trafficked to PGCs, highlighting the roles of Rab11 proteins as novel regulators of N-glycosylation. Our previous study using IKO mice strongly suggested that N-glycosylation is dysregulated by a Rab11 deficiency (23Sobajima T. Yoshimura S.I. Iwano T. Kunii M. Watanabe M. Atik N. Mushiake S. Morii E. Koyama Y. Miyoshi E. Harada A. Rab11a is required for apical protein localisation in the intestine.Biol. Open. 2015; 4: 86-94Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To elucidate the roles of Rab11 proteins in N-glycosylation, we stably knocked down both Rab11a and Rab11b in HeLa cells (double knockdown (DKD) cells) (28Sobajima T. Yoshimura S. ichiro Maeda T. Miyata H. Miyoshi E. Harada A. The Rab11-binding protein RELCH/KIAA1468 controls intracellular cholesterol distribution.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217: 1777-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The levels of Rab11a and Rab11b in two representative clones of DKD cells (#22 and #27) were analyzed by western blotting with an antibody that reacts with both of the Rab11 isoforms (Fig. 1A). Compared with control cells, the expression levels of the Rab11 isoforms in both DKD clones were essentially negligible, confirming that both Rab11 isoforms were successfully silenced in these cells. To examine the issue of whether the abnormal N-glycosylation found in Rab11-deficient mice was recapitulated in DKD cells, we examined the mobility of heavily N-glycosylated proteins such as Lamp1, Lamp2, and integrin beta 1 by western blotting, which have over 10 N-glycosylation sites (33Isaji T. Sato Y. Fukuda T. Gu J. N-glycosylation of the I-like domain of β1 integrin is essential for β1 integrin expression and biological function. Identification of the minimal N-glycosylation requirement for α5β1.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12207-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Schwake M. Schröder B. Saftig P. Lysosomal membrane proteins and their central role in physiology.Traffic. 2013; 14: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We found that the mobility of these proteins, but not that of the non-N-glycosylated protein Lamin B, was markedly slower in DKD cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that N-glycosylation is disturbed in various glycoproteins in Rab11 DKD cells. To confirm that the mobility shifts were due to abnormal N-glycosylation, proteins from control and DKD cells were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) to remove all N-glycans and analyzed by western blotting. After the PNGase F treatment, the mobility of integrin beta 1 from control and DKD cells converged, demonstrating that the slower mobility of glycoproteins in the DKD cells was due to altered N-glycosylation (Fig. 1C). It should also be noted that integrin beta 1 showed two bands in western blotting, and both forms converged after the PNGase F treatment (Fig. 1C). This indicates that these two bands are differentially glycosylated forms of integrin beta1, which is consistent with previous reports showing that the upper band represents a mature form localized to the cell surface and the lower band represents a premature form localized to the ER (35Shen X. Hong M. Moss J. Vaughan M. BIG1, a brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein, is required for correct glycosylation and function of integrin b1?.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1230-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Treatment with endoglycosidase H (Endo H), which cleaves only oligomannose and hybrid types of N-glycans but not complex type N-glycans, resulted in the downshift of only the lower band (Fig. 1D), further confirming that the mature and the immature forms are modified with complex and oligomannose or hybrid N-glycans, respectively. The mobility shift by the Rab11 knockdown was only observed for the mature form of integrin beta1 (Fig. 1, B and D), suggesting that Rab11a and Rab11b regulate steps at the late stage of N-glycan biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus rather than the early stage in the ER. To investigate how N-glycan structures are altered in DKD cells, we conducted lectin blotting with various lectins with different binding preferences (ConA, oligomannose glycans; PhoSL, core fucose; L4-PHA, β1,6-GlcNAc; SSA, α2,6Sia; MAM, α2,3Sia) (Fig. 2A). We observed slight or moderate increases in the reactivity of some proteins with ConA and L4-PHA in the DKD samples compared with control cells, and we observed only a few changes in the reactivity with PhoSL in DKD cells (Fig. 2A). More striking increases in reactivity with Sia-recognizing lectins, particularly MAM, were observed in the DKD cells, suggesting that the degree of sialylation is enhanced in DKD cells. To confirm this, we performed lectin blotting with β1,4Gal-recognizing RCA120, since the terminal capping of β1,4Gal with sialic acid blocks the binding of RCA120. Consistent with the increases in reactivity with Sia-recognizing lectins, we found a substantial reduction in RCA120 reactivity in DKD cells (Fig. 2B, left). A neuraminidase treatment canceled this reduction (Fig. 2B, right), further confirming that terminal sialylation is enhanced in DKD cells. The mobility shift of the upper band of integrin beta 1 in DKD cells was also canceled by a neuraminidase treatment (compare the second and seventh lanes, the third and eighth lanes in Fig. 2C), indicating that the decreased mobility of glycoproteins in DKD cells is due to enhanced sialylation. To further confirm that sialylation was potentiated in DKD cells, we visualized the level of sialylation in cells by means of a click chemistry approach (36Laughlin S.T. Agard N.J. Baskin J.M. Carrico I.S. Chang P.V. Ganguli A.S. Hangauer M.J. Lo A. Prescher J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Metabolic labeling of glycans with azido sugars for visualization and glycoproteomics.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 230-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Control and DKD cells were incubated with equivalent amounts of N-azidoacetylmannosamine (ManNAz), which is converted to CMP-N-azidoacetyl sialic acid (SiaNAz) and transferred to glycoconjugates by sialyltransferases in cells. The detection of SiaNAz-labeled glycans by click chemistry showed that the level of labeled glycans in DKD cells had dramatically increased in comparison with control cells (Fig. 2D), further showing that sialylation is enhanced in DKD cells. We also found that proteins in culture media of DKD cells also displayed increased reactivity with the MAM lectin (Fig. 2E), excluding the possibility that the increased reactivity of DKD cells with the MAM lectin is caused by an impaired secretion of sialylated proteins. These collective data demonstrate that the knockdown of Rab11 enhances sialylation in the Golgi apparatus. To obtain more convincing evidence for the enhanced sialylation in DKD cells, we next analyzed glycan structures by MS. N-glycans were released from control or Rab11 DKD cells by a PNGase F treatment and reduced, and the N-glycan alditols were then analyzed by LC-ESI-MS (Fig. 3A, Figs. S1 and S2). We detected 202 glycans (Table S1) and found increases in the levels of di-, tri-, and tetra-sialylated glycans and decreases in the levels of mono- and nonsialylated N-glycans in DKD cells compared with control cells (Fig. 3B, left), clearly showing that sialylation is enhanced in DKD cells, consistent with the above results. In contrast, no remarkable differences in the relative amounts of fucosylated glycans were observed (Fig. 3B, right), suggesting that the effects of Rab11 knockdown on glycosylation pathways are not global but, rather, are somewhat selective to sialylation. We further carried out a linkage-specific analysis of sialic acids for the major biantennary N-glycans. Based on the chromatograms of N-glycans from a control fetuin sample whose Sia linkages have already been determined (37Nakano M. Saldanha R. Göbel A. Kavallaris M. Packer N.H. Identification of glycan structure alterations on cell membrane proteins in desoxyepothilone B resistant leukemia cells.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1, left), we were able to successfully assign the Sia linkages of each glycan isomer, even though an extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) included more than one glycan with different Sia linkages (Fig. S1). As a result, we found that the amounts of α2,3- rather than α2,6-sialylated glycans were strikingly elevated in the DKD samples (Fig. 3C, indicated in pink). These findings show that α2,3-sialylation of N-glycans is especially enhanced in DKD cells. To ensure the MS results showing the enhanced α2,3-sialylation of N-glycans in DKD cells, we performed pull-down assays with SSA (α2,6Sia) and MAM (α2,3Sia) lectins. Lysates from control and DKD HeLa cells were incubated with SSA- or MAM-agarose, and the bound integrin beta 1 was analyzed by western blotting. The reactivity of integrin beta 1 from DKD cells with MAM was drastically increased compared with control cells (Fig. 4A, right panel), whereas that with SSA was barely changed (Fig. 4A, middle panel), confirming that α2,3- but not α2,6-sialylation is enhanced in DKD cells. We also measured the amounts of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc), the donor substrate for sialylation, in cells and found that the level of CMP-NeuAc was decreased, rather than being increased in DKD cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4B), excluding the possibility that the enhanced sialylation in DKD cells was caused by an increase in the donor substrate. Combined with the fact that enhanced sialylation in DKD cells is linkage-specific but not global, we reasoned that a glycosyltransferase responsible for the α2,3-sialylation of N-glycans is activated or upregulated by the depletion of Rab11. A recent knockout study clearly showed that among several α2,3-siayltransferases, ST3GAL4 is the dominant enzyme for the α2,3-sialylation of integrin beta 1 N-glycans in HeLa cells (38Qi F. Isaji T. Duan C. Yang J. Wang Y. Fukuda T. Gu J. ST3GAL3, ST3GAL4, and ST3GAL6 differ in their regulation of biological functions via the specificities for the α2,3-sialylation of target proteins.FASEB J. 2020; 34: 881-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This prompted us to hypothesize that the expression or localization of ST3GAL4 is altered in DKD cells. To address this issue, using real-time PCR, we measured the levels of ST3GAL4 mRNA as well as other sialyltransferases that are involved in N-glycan biosynthesis and found that the expression of ST3GAL4 mRNA was not upregulated in DKD cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4C). This excludes the possibility that the enhanced α2,3-sialylation in DKD cells was caused by the upregulation of the expression of the ST3GAL4 gene. We next examined the level and half-life of the ST3GAL4 protein, since an aberrantly high stability of the ST3GAL4 protein might cause an enhanced α2,3-sialylation. Since the endogenous ST3GAL4 protein was difficult to detect due to its low expression level, we overexpressed myc-tagged ST3GAL4 in control and DKD HeLa cells. We first confirmed that the enhanced α2,3-sialylation was observed in ST3GAL4-myc-expressing DKD cells (Fig. S3). The steady-state levels of the expressed ST3GAL4 protein were comparable between the control and DKD cells (Fig. 4D). As the levels of synthesis of exogenously expressed ST3GAL4 are considered to be similar between control and DKD cells, it suggests that the stability of the ST3GAL4 protein is also unlikely altered. However, since Rab11 regulates post-Golgi trafficking, Rab11 might be involved in degradation of its target proteins. To confirm that degradation of ST3GAL4 is not affected by Rab11 knockdown, we performed cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments. CHX is a protein synthesis inhibitor, and chasing a target protein in the presence of CHX for a certain time enables us to estimate its degradation speed. The results indicate that the degradation rates of the expressed ST3GAL4 protein in DKD cells were similar to that in control cells (Fig. 4E). These data show that the mRNA and protein levels of ST3GAL4 were not affected by Rab11 knockdown. We next examined the subcellular localization of ST3GAL4. Since Rab11 was shown to be required for membrane transport from the TGN to recycling endosomes (39De Graaf P. Zwart W.T. Van Dijken R.A.J. Deneka M. Schulz T.K.F. Geijsen N. Coffer P.J. Gadella B.M.

Immunofluorescence staining revealed that although ST3GAL4 was mainly colocalized with TGN46 (a marker for the trans Golgi network (TGN)) (Fig. 5A), it was also distributed in non-Golgi vesicles (Fig. 5B, arrowheads). Costaining of ST3GAL4 with markers for PGCs, such as Transferrin receptor (TfR) (recycling endosomes), EEA1 (early endosomes), and LAMP2 (late endosomes and lysosomes), showed that ST3GAL4 is partially localized in PGCs and particularly in recycling endosomes (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, the number of ST3GAL4-positive non-Golgi dots (Fig. 5A) was significantly decreased in DKD cells compared with control cells (Fig. 5D), while the level of ST3GAL4 in the Golgi was significantly increased in DKD cells (Fig. 5E), suggesting"

In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach to schedule PPE orders among healthcare facilities. In this PPE game, each independent healthcare facility optimises its own storage utilisation in order to keep its PPE cost at a minimum. Such a model can reduce peak demand considerably when applied to a variable PPE consumption profile. Experiments conducted for NHS England regions using actual data confirm that the challenge of securing PPE supply during disasters such as COVID-19 can be eased if proper stock management procedures are adopted. These procedures can include early stockpiling, increasing storage capacities and implementing measures that can prolong the time period between successive infection waves, such as social distancing measures. Simulation results suggest that the provision of PPE dedicated storage space can be a viable solution to avoid straining PPE supply chains in case a second wave of COVID-19 infections occurs."

Human-specific duplicated genes in particular are primary sources of innovation during our evolution although they have very few known functions. Here we examine the brain function of one of these genes (CHRFAM7A) and its product (dupα7 subunit). This gene results from a partial duplication of the ancestral CHRNA7 gene encoding the α7 subunit that forms the homopentameric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR). The functions of α7-nAChR in the brain are well defined, including the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity underlying normal attention, cognition, learning, and memory processes. However, the role of the dupα7 subunit remains unexplored at the neuronal level. Here, we characterize that role by combining immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR and FRET techniques with functional assays of α7-nAChR activity using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell variants with different dupα7 expression levels. Our findings reveal a physical interaction between dupα7 and α7 subunits in fluorescent protein-tagged dupα7/α7 transfected cells that negatively affects normal α7-nAChR activity. Specifically, in both single cells and cell populations, the [Ca2+]i signal and the exocytotic response induced by selective stimulation of α7-nAChR were either significantly inhibited by stable dupα7 overexpression or augmented after silencing dupα7 gene expression with specific siRNAs. These findings identify a new role for the dupα7 subunit as a negative regulator of α7-nAChR-mediated control of exocytotic neurotransmitter release. If this effect is excessive, it would result in an impaired synaptic transmission that could underlie the neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with α7-nAChR dysfunction.

The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) is a ligand-gated ion channel expressed in neurons and nonneuronal cells of the human brain where it mostly forms homopentameric receptors composed of five α7 subunits (1Albuquerque E.X.

Hence, it is a huge challenge to identify endogenous or exogenous mechanisms that could alter α7-nAChR activity and thereby contribute to managing the abovementioned disorders. Recently our group identified a possible endogenous candidate that may interfere with α7-nAChR function, the CHRFAM7A chimeric gene, which is evolutionarily a relatively recent gene since it appears in the human genome after its divergence from other higher primates (30Locke D.P.

Refinement of a chimpanzee pericentric inversion breakpoint to a segmental duplication cluster.Genome Biol. 2003; 4R50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The new hybrid gene results from partial duplication (exons 5–10) of the parent CHRNA7 gene, coding the α7 subunit that forms the α7-nAChR, fused to the FAM7A genetic element (31Gault J. Robinson M.

Thus, we reported that dupα7 overexpression inhibits, both in vitro and in vivo, α7-nAChR-mediated protumorigenic activity in human cell lines from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (38Cedillo J.L. Bordas A. Arnalich F. Esteban-Rodríguez I. Martín-Sánchez C. Extremera M. Atienza G. Rios J.J. Arribas R.L. Montiel C.

Furthermore, using GH4C1 rat pituitary cells and RAW264.7 mouse macrophages transfected with epitope- or fluorescent protein-tagged α7 or dupα7 constructs, we identified the mechanism underlying dupα7 interference in α7-nAChR function. This mechanism consists of the physical interaction between dupα7 and α7 subunits generating heteromeric nAChRs that largely remain mainly trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (39Maldifassi M.C. Martín-Sánchez C. Atienza G. Cedillo J.L. Arnalich F. Bordas A. Zafra F. Gimenez C. Extremera M. Renart J. Montiel C.

Chem. 2018; 293: 13874-13888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the dupα7 sequestration of α7 subunits reduced membrane expression of functional homomeric α7-nAChRs, attenuating their recognized anti-inflammatory capacity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages (39Maldifassi M.C. Martín-Sánchez C. Atienza G. Cedillo J.L. Arnalich F. Bordas A. Zafra F. Gimenez C. Extremera M. Renart J. Montiel C.

Chem. 2018; 293: 13874-13888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The α7 subunit and its duplicate form are naturally coexpressed in the same human cell types, including neuronal, immune, or tumor cells (see Ref. (40Costantini T.W. Dang X. Coimbra R. Eliceiri B.P. Baird A. CHRFAM7A, a human-specific and partially duplicated α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene with the potential to specify a human-specific inflammatory response to injury.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 97: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and references there). Thus, it is to be expected that the dupα7 subunit would behave as an endogenous negative regulator of α7-nAChR-mediated activity in neurons, just as it does in macrophages or tumor cells (38Cedillo J.L. Bordas A. Arnalich F. Esteban-Rodríguez I. Martín-Sánchez C. Extremera M. Atienza G. Rios J.J. Arribas R.L. Montiel C.

Chem. 2018; 293: 13874-13888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This last hypothesis, still unexplored, is the one addressed here using the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line to assess: (i) the physical interaction between α7 and dupα7 subunits in fluorescent protein-tagged α7/dupα7 transfected cells; and (ii) the functional impact of the above interaction in cell variants with different dupα7 expression levels. Immunoblotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Föster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis combined with functional assays of α7-nAChR-activity, in either single cells or cell populations of the above cell variants, allowed us to establish that the dupα7 subunit negatively regulates α7-nAChR-mediated control of exocytotic neurotransmitter release in neuronal cell types. In order to avoid differences in the expression levels of dupα7 mRNA among different SH-SY5Y cultures transiently transfected with the dupα7.pcDNA3.1/Myc-His construct, we stably transfected the cells with this construct, or with its corresponding empty vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His, as described in the corresponding Methods section. A total of seven positive clones resistant to G418 obtained by lipofection (L1 and L2) or nucleofection (N1-N5) of dupα7-Myc were initially selected. In all of them, the dupα7 or α7 mRNA levels were analyzed by qPCR in order to select those clones that, together with the clear overexpression of dupα7, presented endogenous α7 mRNA levels similar to those found in nontransfected cells (Control). We found two clones (L1 and N1) that fit the above requirements (Fig. 1, panels A and B). Since dupα7 mRNA overexpression is much more pronounced in the N1 than in the L1 clones, we proceeded to determine if this difference was maintained at the protein level. Immunoblot data using the anti-Myc antibody to detect the foreign dupα7-Myc protein overexpressed in L1 and N1 clones show that there were no significant differences in protein expression levels (Fig. 1C), so both clones were assayed in parallel throughout our study. Using FRET confocal imaging analysis in SH-SY5Y cells cotransfected with two pairs of α7 and dupα7 constructs (α7-GFP:dupα7-Cherry or dupα7-GFP:α7-Cherry), we evaluated whether dupα7 could physically interact with α7 subunits, thus modulating the α7-nAChR-mediated control of neurotransmission. The results (Fig. 1D) provide evidence that both nAChR subunits were in sufficient proximity to interact with each other as part of a heteropentameric nAChR. Thus, the left panel of the figure shows representative confocal images acquired before (pre) and after (post) acceptor [α7-Cherry] photobleaching at 561 nm in the framed area; the increase in emission at 488 nm of the donor [dupα7-GFP (post)] in the cell analyzed after coexpression of the dupα7-GFP:α7-Cherry pair is worth noting. The right panel of the figure represents the scatter plots of individual data points corresponding to the FRET efficiency values, expressed as a percentage of the maximum efficiency, obtained in the region selected for acceptor photobleaching in cells transfected with the two pairs of constructs assayed in this study at a 1:1 ratio. The error bars represent mean ± standard deviation (SD). The significantly higher FRET efficiency values when dupα7 was the donor of the pair are also worth noting. Consequently, the subsequent experiments were designed to evaluate the functional consequences of this dupα7/α7 interaction, in both cell populations and single cells. One of the most distinctive functions of α7-nAChR in neurons is to promote the exocytotic release of several neurotransmitters as the result of the [Ca2+]i rise induced by receptor stimulation. Therefore, the next experiments aimed to evaluate whether overexpression of dupα7 in SH-SY5Y cells interfered with the [Ca2+]i response induced by 1-s pulses of increasing concentrations of PNU 282987 (1 nM up to 10 μM) applied to cell populations. To amplify the responses induced by the selective α7-nAChR agonist and thus facilitate the subsequent analysis of their possible modulation by dupα7, a fixed concentration of the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the α7-nAChR (PNU 120596; 0.5 μM) was added to the cell medium from 10 min before and during the α7-nAChR agonist pulse. Figure 2A shows the concentration–response curves to the agonist in nontransfected cells (Control), in both the absence and presence of the PAM; it can be observed that the last agent greatly enhanced the agonist-induced response at all tested concentrations. Figure 2B shows the original fluorescence traces induced by different concentrations of PNU 282987 (+PAM) in control cells (black traces; left panel) or in cells expanded from the N1 clone (red traces; right panel). Figure 2, C and D show pooled results from independent cultures (n = 4–12) of normalized [Ca2+]i responses (Δ[Ca2+]i) evoked by increasing concentrations of PNU 282987 in the four cell variants tested [control cells, and cells overexpressing dupα7 (clones L1 and N1), or empty vector]. The Δ[Ca2+]i signals were normalized as a percentage of the maximum response induced by PNU 282987 (3 μM; 100%) in control cells (Fig. 2C) or in the corresponding cell variant (Fig. 2D). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) applied to data in Figure 2C showed that while the Δ[Ca2+]i signal induced by PNU 282987 in cells overexpressing the empty vector was indistinguishable from that found in control cells, the overexpression of dupα7 significantly reduced the α7-nAChR-mediated signal, particularly at the highest agonist testing concentrations (from 30 nM to 10 μM), but not the signal generated by a depolarizing stimulus of high K+ (70 mM, 1 s). The table inserted in Figure 2D shows the EC50 and slope values obtained from the concentration–response curves of PNU 282987 in the four cell variants tested; the application of the above statistical analysis to both parameters did not show significant differences between the Δ[Ca2+]i signals generated in the four variants. To gain further insights into dupα7 negative regulation of the α7-nAChR-induced [Ca2+]i rise, we evaluated this regulation at the single cell level by fluorescence microscopy. The SH-SY5Y cells tested in these experiments belong to the next three cell variants: control, L1 clone, and N1 clone. Individual cells were stimulated with a 1-min pulse of PNU 282987 (1 μM) in the presence of PAM (1 μM) added to the perfusion medium 20 min before and during the application of the stimulus. After a washout period, the cells were exposed to a final high K+ pulse (100 mM, 30 s) to exclude from subsequent analyses those cells that had not responded to the depolarizing stimulus. Figure 3A shows original traces of the fluorescence increase (ΔF) induced by the above two pulses applied successively in two Fura 2-loaded cells representative of the Control (upper panel) and the L1 clone (lower panel) groups. Note that overexpression of dupα7 markedly reduces the α7-nAChR-mediated signal but not that induced by the depolarizing stimulus. In fact, the high K+-evoked response is higher in the dupα7 overexpressing cell than in the control cell, probably because the [Ca2+]i signal induced by PNU 282987 in the latter cell had not yet returned to the basal level when the depolarizing stimulus was applied. Figure 3B shows pooled time-course results of the [Ca2+]i signal evoked by PNU 282987 in 3 to 4 individual cells belonging to each tested cell variant; the signals recorded in the clones were normalized with respect to the signal obtained in control cells. Blockade of the α7-nAChR-induced signal was clearly seen in L1 and N1 clones with respect to control cells, but there were no significant differences in the blocked signal between the two types of clones. Figure 3C shows scatter plots of individual data points and statistical analyses of different kinetic parameters relative to the [Ca2+]i signal induced by PNU 282987 or high K+ in single cells from the three variants (control, clone L1, and clone N1) from independent cultures. The error bars represent mean ± SD of the values obtained in the number of cells appearing in parentheses. The overexpression of dupα7 significantly reduced the “Peak Amplitude” and the “Area Under the Curve” of the [Ca2+]i signal induced by α7-nAChR but not the signal evoked by the depolarizing stimulus. None of the other analyzed kinetic parameters, independently of the stimulus, was significantly affected by dupα7 overexpression. The [Ca2+]i rise induced by α7-nAChRs in neurons activates the SNARE protein complex and the consequent discharge of the vesicular content (neurotransmitter) into the synaptic space by an exocytotic mechanism. Thus, it is likely that the α7-nAChR-mediated exocytotic response in SH-SY5Y cells is affected by dupα7 overexpression, as is the [Ca2+]i signal induced by the same receptor subtype. The following experiments were aimed at evaluating this hypothesis at the single cell level. For this, synaptic vesicles of SH-SY5Y cells belonging to the three cell variants tested in this study (control, clone L1, and clone N1) were loaded with the fluorescent FM1-43 dye as described in the corresponding Methods section. Subsequently, the exocytosis of the labeled vesicles was promoted by two successive 1-min pulses of 1 μM PNU 282987 (+PAM, 1 μM) and high K+ (100 mM), separated by a washing period. Figure 4A shows two original destaining traces (loss of the fluorescent signal) indicative of the extent of the exocytotic response induced by the two stimuli in a Control cell and in a cell overexpressing dupα7 (Clone L1). The upper diagram of both registers illustrates the two key steps of what happened with the labeled vesicles in each cell type in response to the two stimuli: 1) PNU 282987 induced vesicular exocytosis (drop in the fluorescent signal) in the Control cell but not in the one with dupα7 overexpression; and 2), in contrast, high K+ was not abl"

Although it is well known that cell migration is typically driven by the actin cytoskeleton, the cause of this migratory behavior remains poorly understood. We analyze the spontaneous dynamics of actin assembly due to nucleation promoting factors, where actin filaments lead to an inactivation of the nucleators. We show that this system exhibits excitable dynamics and can spontaneously generate waves, which we analyse in detail. By using a phase-field approach, we show that these waves can generate cellular random walks. We explore how the characteristics of these persistent random walks depend on the parameters governing the actin-nucleator dynamics. In particular, we find that the effective diffusion constant and the persistence time depend strongly on the speed of filament assembly and the rate of nucleator inactivation. Our findings point to a deterministic origin of the random walk behavior and suggest that cells could adapt their migration pattern by modifying the pool of available actin."

Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) and tyrosine kinases are integral to inflammatory responses and are therefore potential targets for novel anti-inflammatory therapies. We have determined the involvement of specific kinases in Pa-induced inflammation. The effects of kinase inhibitors against p38MAPK, MEK 1/2, JNK 1/2, Syk or c-Src, a combination of a p38MAPK with Syk inhibitor, or a novel narrow spectrum kinase inhibitor (NSKI), were evaluated against the release of the proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine, IL-6 and CXCL8 from BEAS-2B and CFBE41o- epithelial cells by Pa. Effects of a Syk inhibitor against phosphorylation of the MAPKs were also evaluated. IL-6 and CXCL8 release by Pa were significantly inhibited by p38MAPK and Syk inhibitors (p&lt;0.05). Phosphorylation of HSP27, but not ERK or JNK, was significantly inhibited by Syk kinase inhibition. A combination of p38MAPK and Syk inhibitors showed synergy against IL-6 and CXCL8 induction and an NSKI completely inhibited IL-6 and CXCL8 at low concentrations. Pa-induced inflammation is dependent on p38MAPK primarily, and Syk partially, which is upstream of p38MAPK. The NSKI suggests that inhibiting specific combinations of kinases is a potent potential therapy for Pa-induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3126625247,"Recently, coupled musculoskeletal-finite element modelling approaches have emerged as a way to investigate femoral neck loading during various daily activities. Combining personalised gait data with finite element models will not only allow us to study changes in motion/movement, but also their effects on critical internal structures, such as the femur. However, previous studies have been hampered by the small sample size and the lack of fully personalised data in order to construct the coupled model. Therefore, the aim of this study was to build a pipeline for a fully personalised multiscale (body-organ level) model to investigate the strain levels at the femoral neck during a normal gait cycle. Five postmenopausal women were included in this study. The CT and MRI scans of the lower limb, and gait data were collected for all participants. Muscle forces derived from the body level musculoskeletal models were used as boundary constraints on the finite element femur models. Principal strains were estimated at the femoral neck region during a full gait cycle. Considerable variation was found in the predicted peak strain among individuals with mean peak first principal strain of 0.24% ± 0.11% and mean third principal strain of -0.29% ± 0.24%. For four individuals, two overall peaks of the maximum strains were found to occur when both feet were in contact with the floor, while one individual had one peak at the toe-off phase. Both the joint contact forces and the muscular forces were found to substantially influence the loading at the femoral neck. A higher correlation was found between the predicted peak strains and the gluteus medius (R2 ranged between 0.95 and 0.99) than the hip joint contact forces (R2 ranged between 0.63 and 0.96). Therefore, the current findings suggest that personal variations are substantial, and hence it is important to consider multiple subjects before deriving general conclusions for a target population."
https://openalex.org/W3127729220,"Cancer cell populations consist of phenotypically heterogeneous cells. Growing evidence suggests that pre-existing phenotypic differences among cancer cells correlate with differential susceptibility to anticancer drugs and eventually lead to a relapse. Such phenotypic differences can arise not only externally driven by the environmental heterogeneity around individual cells but also internally by the intrinsic fluctuation of cells. However, the quantitative characteristics of intrinsic phenotypic heterogeneity emerging even under constant environments and their relevance to drug susceptibility remain elusive. Here we employed a microfluidic device, mammalian mother machine, for studying the intrinsic heterogeneity of growth dynamics of mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells (L1210) across tens of generations. The generation time of this cancer cell line had a distribution with a long tail and a heritability across generations. We determined that a minority of cell lineages exist in a slow-cycling state for multiple generations. These slow-cycling cell lineages had a higher chance of survival than the fast-cycling lineages under continuous exposure to the anticancer drug Mitomycin C. This result suggests that heritable heterogeneity in cancer cells’ growth in a population influences their susceptibility to anticancer drugs."

Understanding how the polysaccharide components are synthesized could provide new means to combat bacterial infections. We have previously characterized two pairs of homologous enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of capsular sugar precursors GDP-6-deoxy-D-altro-heptose and GDP-6-OMe-L-gluco-heptose in Campylobacter jejuni. However, the substrate specificity and mechanism of action of these enzymes—C3 and/or C5 epimerases DdahB and MlghB and C4 reductases DdahC and MlghC—are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that these enzymes are highly specific for heptose substrates, using mannose substrates inefficiently with the exception of MlghB. We show that DdahB and MlghB feature a jellyroll fold typical of cupins, which possess a range of activities including epimerizations, GDP occupying a similar position as in cupins. DdahC and MlghC contain a Rossman fold, a catalytic triad, and a small C-terminal domain typical of short-chain dehydratase reductase enzymes. Integrating structural information with site-directed mutagenesis allowed us to identify features unique to each enzyme and provide mechanistic insight. In the epimerases, mutagenesis of H67, D173, N121, Y134, and Y132 suggested the presence of alternative catalytic residues. We showed that the reductases could reduce GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-mannulose without prior epimerization although DdahC preferred the pre-epimerized substrate and identified T110 and H180 as important for substrate specificity and catalytic efficacy.

We have previously characterized the dehydratases, epimerases, and reductases that modify GDP-manno-heptose into various heptose forms found in the capsule of Campylobacter jejuni (Fig. 1) and in the lipopolysaccharide of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (1Butty F.D.

Specifically, the Y. pseudotuberculosis pathway leading to 6-deoxy-D-manno-heptose was a simple two-step pathway consisting of C4, C6 dehydration, and C4 reduction of GDP-manno-heptose (1Butty F.D.

In contrast, the C. jejuni Ddah and Mlgh modification pathways leading to 6-deoxy-D-altro-heptose and 3,6-OMe-L-gluco heptose, respectively, have been found to be more complex (Fig. 1). Both pathways operate via a 6-deoxy-4-keto intermediate (P1 formed by DdahA (aka WcbK) (2McCallum M. Shaw G.S. Creuzenet C.

We showed experimentally that DdahB is a C3 epimerase leading to the formation of a single C3 epimerized product (denoted as P4α), whereas MlghB is a C3/C5 epimerase leading to the formation of three products encompassing the same C3 only epimer (P4α) as DdahB but also the C5 only epimer (denoted as P4β) and the double C3, C5 epimer (denoted as P4γ) (Fig. 1). DdahB and MlghB were devoid of reductase activity, but both DdahC and MlghC served as C4 reductases, reducing epimerized products made by DdahB and MlghB to generate products denoted as P5α and P5γ, respectively (3McCallum M.

In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that all these enzymes are important for the function of the polysaccharide that incorporates their reaction products, namely contributing to capsule- or lipopolysaccharide-based resistance to serum, bile salts, and/or antibiotics, allowing epithelial cell invasion and playing an essential role in gut colonization and/or dissemination to deeper organs (5Ho N.

On the opposite face of the sugar ring, Tyr 133 donates a proton at C5 position from its hydroxyl group, thus acting as an acid.

Residues important for these activities are summarized in Table S2. The reduction reaction is catalyzed by Ser 107, Tyr 136, and Lys 140, which form the typical SYK catalytic triad of short-chain dehydrogenase reductase enzymes (23Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M.

This residue is important for final reduction of the 4-keto intermediate once epimerization is complete. In GFS, Cys 109 and His 179 form a catalytic dyad where Cys 109 is the base and His 179 is the acid for epimerization at both C3 and C5 positions (19Lau S.T. Tanner M.E.

Functionally equivalent residues are Cys 145/Lys 217 in GME. Because all known C3/C5 epimerases, C4 reductases, described above use hexoses as substrates while the Campylobacter enzymes function in heptose modification pathways, we undertook the investigation of the Campylobacter enzymes to decipher the extent of their heptose versus mannose specificity and also to understand why all enzymes predicted to be C3/C5 epimerases with C4 reductase activity performed different reactions on different heptose intermediates. The studies involve structural studies of both enzymes, modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and functional analysis on GDP-manno-heptose and GDP-mannose–derived substrates. These studies will support the future applications mentioned above but are also of fundamental importance to provide a better understanding of complex glycan synthesis. MlghB and DdahB are the only C3/C5 epimerases demonstrated to have activity on heptose-based substrates to date. To assess their specificity, GDP-manno-heptose and GDP-mannose were converted into the 4-keto, 6-deoxy-derivatives P1 (7 carbon) and P1’ (6 carbon) by DdahA and equimolar amounts were used as substrates for MlghB and DdahB. As established before (3McCallum M. Shaw G.S. Creuzenet C. Comparison of predicted epimerases and reductases of the Campylobacter jejuni D-altro- and L-gluco-heptose synthesis pathways.J. Biol.

In contrast, DdahB mostly converts the P1 substrate to P4α (C3 epimer) (Fig. 2, B and F), but prolonged incubation (3 h) with DdahB led to appearance of P4β (C5 only) and P4γ (C3 and C5) (Fig. 2B) and concomitant decrease in the P4α peak. Because there was no further conversion of P1 in that time frame, this suggests that C5 epimerization also occurred, generating P4β and further converting P4α into P4γ. Both enzymes were able to epimerize a mannose (six carbon) derived substrate denoted P1’ into product P4’ (the nomenclature is chosen to mirror the heptose conversion with the addition of the prime denoting the six-carbon substrate). P1’ was processed much less efficiently than P1, especially by DdahB where catalysis was limited even after a 3-h incubation and was accompanied by significant substrate degradation (Fig. 2, A, C and E). DdahB thus possesses clear “heptose preference.” Definitely establishing the nature of P4’ has proven impossible because of its instability and of the very small amounts of material produced. Because DdahB primarily catalyzes C3 epimerization activity of heptose (3McCallum M. Shaw G.S. Creuzenet C.

This would imply MlghB was incapable of C5 epimerization of the smaller mannose-based substrate. The additional carbon of the P1 substrate is critical for enzyme turnover, appearing essential for the C5 position. DdahB and MlghB were purified as homodimers (Fig S1, A and B, Table S3), crystallized, and their structures solved to 1.30 Å and 2.14 Å resolution, respectively. DdahB crystallized in space group P1 21 1, with two chains in the asymmetric unit and MlghB crystallized in space group P21 21 21, with four chains in the asymmetric unit. Statistics on the final structures are reported in Table 1. The final structure of DdahB has two monomers in the asymmetric unit that are expected to form a stable dimer (24Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar), consistent with size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS, Fig. 3A and Fig. S1A). Residues 1 to 139 and 145 to 174 of monomer A and residues 3 to 181 of monomer B are experimentally located. The monomer comprises 14 β-strands and two short α-helices, with nine β-strands, arranged in two β-sheets, forming a small antiparallel β-barrel, known as a jellyroll. The fold of the protein identifies it as a member of the cupin family (25Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Goodenough P.W. Evolution of functional diversity in the cupin superfamily.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). MlghB has the same cupin fold as DdahB, and the monomers superimpose with an RMSD of 0.7 Å for the 163 overlapping Cα atoms and share 81% sequence identity (Table S4). Like DdahB, MlghB has two dimers (24Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol.

In the dimer, a β-strand from one monomer adds, in an antiparallel manner, to the β-sheet of the other monomer. The arrangement buries around 20% of the surface area of each monomer. No cofactor was detected in either structure.Table 1Additional crystallographic parameters for DdahB and MlghBParameter measuredDdahBMlghBDdahBGDP-mannoseMlghBGDP-mannoseData collection Space groupP21P212121P21P212121 Wavelength0.9160.9161.541.54 Unit cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)47.8, 68.3, 53.747.3, 121.7, 153.848.0, 67.8, 53.142.4, 121.9, 154.1α, β, γ (°)90, 91.4, 9090, 90, 9090, 91.8, 9090, 90, 90 Resolution (Å)aValues in parenthesis are for the highest shell.34–1.3 (1.32–1.30)95–2.14 (2.20–2.14)53–2.35 (2.43–2.35)56.7–2.60 (2.67–2.60) RmergeaValues in parenthesis are for the highest shell.0.047 (0.57)0.06 (0.76)0.061 (0.169)0.162 (0.669) I/σIaValues in parenthesis are for the highest shell.13.9 (1.2)12.7 (1.1)16.3 (6.1)12.5 (3.5) CC1/2aValues in parenthesis are for the highest shell.1.0 (0.7)1.0 (0.5)1 (0.9)1.0 (0.8) CompletenessaValues in parenthesis are for the highest shell.95 (73)100 (100)98 (89)99 (92) RedundancyaValues in parenthesis are for the highest shell.2.7 (1.4)5.9 (4.2)3.6 (2.7)7.0 (6.8)Refinement Resolution (Å)aValues in parenthesis are for the highest shell.34–1.3 (1.32–1.30)95–2.1 (2.18–2.14)39–2.35 (2.43–2.35)57–2.60 (2.67–2.60) ReflectionsaValues in parenthesis are for the highest shell.76,397 (4400)41,762 (2944)13,466 (879)23,972 (1611) Rwork/Rfree %aValues in parenthesis are for the highest shell.14.8/17.5 (31.7/30.1)21.6/23.9 (42.1/42.4)18.5/24.3 (19.4/31.5)21.0/23.5 (29.4/34.3) No. of atomsProtein2742564827425858Water4667468Ligands--67112 Residual B factors (Å2)Protein2164222326Water48461116Ligand--4547 RMSDBond lengths (Å)0.0130.0100.0070.010Bond angles (°)1.61.41.31.6 RamachandranFavored (%)98999899Outliers (%)00007ANI7ANG7ANJ7AN4a Values in parenthesis are for the highest shell. Open table in a new tab The fold of the monomer and dimeric arrangement of both DdahB and MlghB closely resemble that of RmlC, the third enzyme in the dTDP-L-rhamnose pathway (Fig. 3C and Table S4 for RMSD values). RmlC was the first cupin C3/C5 epimerase enzyme structure to be described (15Giraud M.F. Leonard G.A. Field R.A. Berlind C. Naismith J.H. RmlC, the third enzyme of dTDP-L-rhamnose pathway, is a new class of epimerase.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The structural similarity is much higher than sequence similarity (38% identity). A search of the RCSB reveals many other cupin fold enzymes including multiple C3/C5 epimerases. As DdahB and MlghB can both epimerize GDP-mannose (in addition to their normal heptose-based substrates), we attempted to obtain cocomplexes with GDP-mannose. The structure of DdahB in the presence of GDP-mannose was solved to a resolution of 2.35 Å. Although the crystal was soaked in a solution of GDP-mannose prepared in mother liquor before freezing, the electron density was poor. We positioned GDP-mannose in one chain and GDP only in the other (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2). The presence of GDP-mannose in one chain suggested to us the problem was not degradation of GDP-mannose but rather the disorder. We attributed this to the fact GDP-mannose is not the true natural substrate and therefore its binding may be suboptimal. There was little change in the protein structure upon substrate binding (Table S4). MlghB in the presence of GDP-mannose crystallized in the same unit cell as native, diffracted to 2.6 Å, showed little change in structure, but we were only able to locate the GDP moiety for each monomer (Fig. S2 and Table S4). In both proteins, the guanine, ribose, and the phosphate attached to ribose portions of the GDP were bound at the same location, at the dimer interface. In both structures, the guanine ring makes hydrogen bonds to Asn 22, Thr 33, and Lys 54∗ (∗ denotes this residue is located in the other monomer in the dimer), with Ile 3 and Ile 31 stacking on opposite sides of t"
https://openalex.org/W3126312735,"From the 17th century until the arrival of hybrids in 1960s, maize landraces were cultivated in the South-West of France (SWF), a traditional region for maize cultivation. A set of landraces were collected in this area between the 1950s and 1980s and were then conserved ex situ in a germplam collection. Previous studies using molecular markers on approx. twenty landraces from this region suggested that they belonged to a Pyrenees-Galicia Flint genetic group and originated from hybridizations between Caribbean and Northern Flint germplasms introduced to Europe. In this study, we assessed the structure and genetic diversity of 194 SWF maize landraces to better elucidate their origin, using a 50K SNP array and a bulk DNA approach. We identified two weakly differentiated genetic groups, one in the Western part and the other in the Eastern part of the studied region. We highlighted the existence of a longitudinal gradient along the SWF area that was probably maintained through the interplay between genetic drifts and restricted gene flows. The contact zone between the two groups observed near the Garonne valley may be the result of these evolutionnary forces. We found in landraces from the East part of the region significant cases of admixture between landraces from the Northern Flint group and landraces from either the Caribbean, Andean or Italian groups. We then assumed that SWF landraces had a multiple origin with a predonderance of Northern Flint germplasm for the two SWF groups, notably for the East part."

However, virtually nothing is known about Ang II actions on the basolateral conductance of principal and intercalated cells. Here, we combined macroscopic and single channel patch clamp recordings from freshly isolated mouse collecting ducts with biochemical and fluorescence methods to demonstrate an acute stimulation of the basolateral Cl− conductance and specifically the ClC-K2 Cl− channel by nanomolar Ang II concentrations in intercalated cells. In contrast, Ang II did not exhibit measurable effects on the basolateral conductance and on Kir4.1/5.1 potassium channel activity in principal cells. Although both Ang II receptors AT1 and AT2 are expressed in collecting duct cells, we show that AT1 receptors were essential for stimulatory actions of Ang II on ClC-K2. Moreover, AT1R−/− mice had decreased renal ClC-K2 expression. We further demonstrated that activation of NADPH oxidases is the major signaling pathway downstream of Ang II-AT1R that leads to stimulation of ClC-K2. Treatment of freshly isolated collecting ducts with Ang II led to production of reactive oxygen species on the same timescale as single channel ClC-K2 activation.

Ang II also increases Cl− reabsorption, in part by stimulating apically localized HCO3−/Cl− exchanger pendrin in B-type intercalated cells (10Pech V. Kim Y.H. Weinstein A.M. Everett L.A. Pham T.D.

Basolateral electrical conductance of the collecting duct principal cells is almost exclusively K+ selective (29Zaika O. Palygin O. Tomilin V. Mamenko M. Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O.

The most prevalent heteromeric inward rectifying Kir4.1/5.1 40 pS potassium channel is essential for K+ recycling to set up a strong hyperpolarizing resting potential on the basolateral membrane around −70 mV to establish a favorable driving force for ENaC-mediated Na+ reabsorption (29Zaika O.

Kir4.1/5.1 is also expressed in the upstream segments, most notably the distal convoluted tubule, to control NaCl reabsorption via thiazide-sensitive NCC cotransporter (32Terker A.S. Zhang C.

Loss-of-function mutations in the KCNJ10 gene encoding Kir4.1 subunit result in EAST/SeSAME syndrome, a complex electrolyte imbalance disorder manifested as hypotension, natriuresis, hypocalciuria, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis (34Bockenhauer D.

Intercalated cells of the collecting duct do not express Na+/K+ ATPase and have no electrogenic basolateral potassium conductance (7Roy A. Al-bataineh M.M. Pastor-Soler N.M.

Instead, activity of the ClC-K2 chloride channel determines basolateral Cl− transport and sets the resting potential around −20 mV (37Hennings J.C. Andrini O. Picard N. Paulais M. Huebner A.K.

Genet. 2001; 29: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Of note, Kir4.1/5.1 and ClC-K2 are expressed in all cells of the thick ascending limb and distal convoluted tubule, whereas they are separated to principal and intercalated cells of the collecting duct, respectively (43Kobayashi K. Uchida S. Mizutani S. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Intrarenal and cellular localization of CLC-K2 protein in the mouse kidney.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that such mosaic architecture of the collecting duct allows independent cell type–specific regulation of Na+ and Cl− transport by endocrine signals, such as Ang II. The major focus of the current study was to explore the functional consequences and uncover the molecular mechanisms of Ang II actions on Kir4.1./5.1 potassium and ClC-K2 chloride conductance in native collecting duct cells. The renal collecting duct is a heterogeneous nephron segment containing electrically uncoupled principal and intercalated cells exhibiting different morphology and physiological functions (6Pearce D. Soundararajan R. Trimpert C. Kashlan O.B. Deen P.M. Kohan D.E. Collecting duct principal cell transport processes and their regulation.Clin. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2014; 10: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Roy A. Al-bataineh M.M. Pastor-Soler N.M. Collecting duct intercalated cell function and regulation.Clin. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2015; 10: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We first used patch clamp electrophysiology in freshly isolated collecting duct to assess Ang II actions on the basolateral conductance in principal and intercalated cells. Since electrical conductance of the apical membrane is much lower than the conductance of the basolateral membrane for both cell types (29Zaika O. Palygin O. Tomilin V. Mamenko M. Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Insulin and IGF-1 activate Kir4.1/5.1 channels in cortical collecting duct principal cells to control basolateral membrane voltage.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2016; 310: F311-F321Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 44Gray D.A. Frindt G. Zhang Y.Y. Palmer L.G. Basolateral K+ conductance in principal cells of rat CCD.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 288: F493-F504Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the changes in macroscopic whole cell current chiefly reflect alterations in the electrical conductance of the basolateral membrane. Figure 1A shows representative macroscopic currents from aquaporin type 2 (AQP2)-positive principal cells of freshly isolated collecting ducts before and after application of Ang II (500 nM for 3 min). The respective current–voltage relations demonstrate notable inward rectification and reversal around −70 mV (Fig. 1B), which is characteristic of the K+-selective conductance via Kir4.1/5.1 channel, as we and others have reported previously (29Zaika O. Palygin O. Tomilin V. Mamenko M. Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Insulin and IGF-1 activate Kir4.1/5.1 channels in cortical collecting duct principal cells to control basolateral membrane voltage.Am. J.

Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F1398-F1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe any significant changes in the amplitude of the Kir4.1/5.1-mediated K+ current in principal cells after treatment with Ang II (Fig. 1, A and B). The AQP2-negative intercalated cells exhibited anion-selective conductance with a reversal around −20 mV (Fig. 1, C and D), which is mediated by the ClC-K2 Cl− channel on the basolateral membrane (45Tomilin V.N. Zaika O. Subramanya A.R. Pochynyuk O. Dietary K+ and Cl- independently regulate basolateral conductance in principal and intercalated cells of the collecting duct.Pflugers Arch. 2018; 470: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Of importance, application of Ang II (500 nM for 3 min) significantly increased the amplitude of the Cl−-dependent current by almost 2-fold. These results show that Ang II increases the basolateral conductance specifically in the intercalated cells of the collecting duct. We next assessed the effects of Ang II on the basolateral conductance of collecting duct cells at the single channel level. As shown in the representative experiment (Fig. 2A) and the summary graph (Fig. 2B), application of Ang II (500 nM) did not affect the open probability of the 40 pS Kir4.1/5.1 channel, the dominant K+ channel in the basolateral membrane of the principal cells (29Zaika O. Palygin O. Tomilin V. Mamenko M. Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Insulin and IGF-1 activate Kir4.1/5.1 channels in cortical collecting duct principal cells to control basolateral membrane voltage.Am. J.

Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F1398-F1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ang II significantly increased the open probability of the 10 pS ClC-K2 channel (46Zaika O. Mamenko M. Boukelmoune N. Pochynyuk O. IGF-1 and insulin exert opposite actions on ClC-K2 activity in the cortical collecting ducts.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2015; 308: F39-F48Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in a reversible manner in intercalated cells (Fig. 3A). As summarized in Figure 3B, the mean open probability was 0.32 ± 0.06, 0.52 ± 0.05, and 0.31 ± 0.06 in the control, after Ang II application, and following washout with control medium, respectively. Ang II increased the ClC-K2 open probability in a dose-dependent manner. As shown in Figure 3C, Ang II concentrations higher than 5 nM exhibited a significant stimulatory effect on single channel ClC-K2 activity. It is worth mentioning that similar levels of interstitial Ang II were reported in the kidney (18Navar L.G. Lewis L. Hymel A. Braam B. Mitchell K.D. Tubular fluid concentrations and kidney contents of angiotensins I and II in anesthetized rats.J. Am. Soc.

A diverse array of histone posttranslational modifications contribute to the dynamic regulation of chromatin architecture. Discrete combinations of these modifications have been proposed to form a putative “histone code” that can be read out by effector proteins and complexes, to regulate transcription by controlling access to individual genomic loci (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. The language of covalent histone modifications.Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6357) Google Scholar, 2Jenuwein T. Allis C.D.

Regulation of chromatin by histone modifications.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Aberrant alterations in histone coding mechanisms have been extensively linked to the altered transcriptomes observed in tumors (4Chi P. Allis C.D. Wang G.G. Covalent histone modifications--miswritten, misinterpreted and mis-erased in human cancers.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Further, genetic alterations in chromatin regulatory proteins are among the most frequent mutational events observed across numerous cancer types (5Koschmann C. Nunez F.J. Mendez F. Brosnan-Cashman J.A. Meeker A.K. Lowenstein P.R. Castro M.G. Mutated chromatin regulatory factors as tumor drivers in cancer.Cancer Res. 2017; 77: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Accordingly, there is significant therapeutic interest in pharmacological modulation of key chromatin regulatory proteins (6Zhao L. Duan Y.T. Lu P. Zhang Z.J. Zheng X.K. Wang J.L. Feng W.S.

The multisubunit Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a key chromatin regulator that exhibits histone methyltransferase activity on H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). The catalytic core of PRC2 consists of an SAM-dependent histone methyltransferase (either EZH1 or EZH2), an H3K27me3-binding subunit (EED), and a Zn-finger, scaffolding subunit (SUZ12). Multiple heterozygous point mutations have been observed in the EZH2 subunit of PRC2. These mutations are a recurrent genomic feature observed in multiple cancer types, with the highest frequency presenting in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (8Kim K.H. Roberts C.W. Targeting EZH2 in cancer.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Biochemically, these mutations alter the catalytic activity of EZH2, thereby resulting in aberrant, EZH2-mediated global increases in H3K27me3 levels (9Yap D.B. Chu J. Berg T. Schapira M. Cheng S.W.

Furthermore, EZH2 catalytic function has been implicated more broadly in oncology with EZH2-mediated gene silencing contributing not only to oncogenic pathway activation but also to acquired drug resistance and suppression of antitumor immune responses in T cells (8Kim K.H.

The first inhibitors described belong to multiple series of pyridone-containing small molecules (EZH2i) that target a pocket located near the interface of EZH2 and EED. The critical nature of the pyridone moiety was made clear after multiple reports emerged detailing cocrystal structures of several of these inhibitors with PRC2. These analyses revealed that the sole point of overlap between the compound-binding pocket on EZH2 and the SAM-binding site was the area occupied by the pyridone of the respective compounds. This structural insight not only illuminated the previously unknown physical basis for the compounds' SAM-competitive mechanism of inhibition but also cemented the central role of the pyridone in the context of these EZH2 inhibitors (16Bratkowski M.

Med. Chem. 2016; 59: 9928-9941Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Some of the more recent PRC2 inhibitor reports have focused on the biochemical role of H3K27me3 binding to the EED subunit of PRC2. The H3K27me3-EED binding event in the context of PRC2 is well characterized as an allosteric stimulator of EZH2 methyltransferase activity (19Xu C. Bian C. Yang W. Galka M. Ouyang H. Chen C. Qiu W. Liu H. Jones A.E. MacKenzie F. Pan P. Li S.S. Wang H. Min J. Binding of different histone marks differentially regulates the activity and specificity of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).Proc.

Accordingly, small molecules that potently antagonize the EED–H3K27me3 interaction also allosterically inhibit EZH2 catalytic function. The clinical utility of EED-targeted small molecules is yet to be determined, but preclinically, these molecules have resulted in tumor growth inhibition similar to that observed for SAM-competitive PRC2 inhibitors (15Danishuddin Subbarao N.

Biol. 2017; 13: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, multiple SAM-competitive EZH2 inhibitors have demonstrated clinical activity in the absence of dose-limiting toxicities (13Gulati N. Beguelin W. Giulino-Roth L. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitors.Leuk. Lymphoma. 2018; 59: 1574-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Observation of emerging clinical profiles, in addition to preclinical studies in murine models, has led us to hypothesize that unlocking the full therapeutic potential of EZH2 inhibitors will require molecules that achieve more comprehensive, durable target engagement than can be achieved with existing clinical EZH2 inhibitors. Recent mechanistic studies into one subseries of SAM-competitive EZH2 inhibitors have demonstrated that these molecules exhibit slow, tight-binding behavior. Detailed kinetics studies led to estimated binding affinities of <100 pM for allosterically activated PRC2 for the most potent compound characterized (23Van Aller G.S. Pappalardi M.B. Ott H.M. Diaz E. Brandt M. Schwartz B.J. Miller W.H. Dhanak D. McCabe M.T. Verma S.K. Creasy C.L. Tummino P.J. Kruger R.G. Long residence time inhibition of EZH2 in activated polycomb repressive complex 2.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Characterization of such high-affinity interactions to elucidate structure–activity relationships (SARs) is challenging using traditional, equilibrium-based assay formats. Theoretical treatment of binding equilibria by Motulsky and Mahan in 1983 first noted that the required equilibration time for an interaction with ligand concentrations equal to its Kd, under pseudo-first-order conditions, is a function of the drug-target residence time (τ) (24Motulsky H.J. Mahan L.C. The kinetics of competitive radioligand binding predicted by the law of mass action.Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar, 25Copeland R.A.

Residence time of receptor-ligand complexes and its effect on biological function.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5481-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This can result in interactions that will require multiple days of equilibration to accurately assess affinity if the protein-inhibitor complex exhibits sufficiently slow koff values. This concept was recently highlighted in a report detailing biosensor-based kinetic methodologies to quantify single-digit pM affinities in order to circumvent the practical limitations of equilibrium-based biochemical assays (28Quinn J.G. Pitts K.E. Steffek M. Mulvihill M.M. Determination of affinity and residence time of potent drug-target complexes by label-free biosensing.J. Med. Chem. 2018; 61: 5154-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, biosensor-based methodologies, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), have limited utility in studying PRC2-inhibitor kinetics because of the large complex size, long residence time of EZH2 inhibitors, and the practical limitations of assessing kinetics in the activated state because of nonspecific interactions between cationic histone peptides and the gold biosensor surface. We recently reported residence time enhancement for EZH2 inhibitors as assessed by a jump dilution method utilizing TR-FRET technology (29Khanna A. Cote A. Arora S. Moine L. Gehling V.S. Brenneman J. Cantone N. Stuckey J.I. Apte S. Ramakrishnan A. Bruderek K. Bradley W.D. Audia J.E. Cummings R.T. Sims 3rd, R.J. et al.Design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of second generation EZH2 inhibitors with long residence time.ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2020; 11: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe the full scope of biochemical approaches we used to kinetically characterize high-affinity, pyridone-containing EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i). Key technical nuances not detailed previously are described here that enabled kinetic characterization of second-generation EZH2i. Further, in this work, we also expand the methodology for kon determination to enable fully quantitative potency assessments. Finally, we expand on the structure–kinetic relationships (SKRs) described previously (29Khanna A. Cote A. Arora S. Moine L. Gehling V.S. Brenneman J. Cantone N. Stuckey J.I. Apte S. Ramakrishnan A. Bruderek K. Bradley W.D. Audia J.E. Cummings R.T. Sims 3rd, R.J. et al.Design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of second generation EZH2 inhibitors with long residence time.ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2020; 11: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) by showing the universality of the key structural motif to significantly enhance EZH2-inhibitor residence time across all scaffolds tested. The insights from our kinetic studies have enabled us to drive our second-generation series SAM-competitive EZH2 inhibitors to sub-pM biochemical potencies that correlate with enhanced tumor cell killing in vitro and in vivo. The standard biochemical assay for assessing enzyme-inhibitor residence times is a jump dilution-based methodology in which enzyme and inhibitor are pre-equilibrated at an inhibitor concentration equal to its IC90 value as determined in an equilibrium-based biochemical assay (30Copeland R.A. Basavapathruni A. Moyer M. Scott M.P. Impact of enzyme concentration and residence time on apparent activity recovery in jump dilution analysis.Anal. Biochem. 2011; 416: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The pre-equilibration is followed by a rapid, 100-fold dilution that results in an inhibitor concentration equal to its IC10 value. However, the observed sub-nM EZH2i potencies coupled with the relatively slow turnover of H3 by EZH2 (kcat ∼25/h) make dilution to IC10 simply impractical. Further, this cannot be compensated for by increasing the concentration of cofactor competitor due to the radioactive assay readout, because radioactive SAM is stored in a sulfuric acid solution, which precludes its use at concentrations >∼5× Km without substantially altering buffer pH. To overcome these challenges, we applied a modified jump dilution methodology in which inhibitors were diluted to their Cheng–Prusoff (31Yung-Chi C. Prusoff W.H. Relationship between the inhibition constant (KI) and the concentration of inhibitor which causes 50 per cent inhibition (I50) of an enzymatic reaction.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12056) Google Scholar) adjusted IC50app at the highest possible SAM concentration. A mathematical correction was then applied to kobs to account for rebinding during the establishment of equilibria, thus allowing a more accurate residence time estimate (Supplementary Note I). To corroborate our estimated residence time values, we compared them to SPR-determined values using a specialized methodology for analysis of long residence time compounds with a test set of EZH2i including clinical stage compounds and compounds 1–3, (Fig. 1). Overall, we observed good agreement with the estimated compound residence time for basal PRC2 (complex in the absence of H3K27me3 activator peptide) between the two methodologies in spite of the differing pH (8.5 versus 7.4) and salt concentrations (0 versus 150 mM NaCl) of the biochemical and SPR buffers, respectively. The most significant outlier in this set can be accounted for because the residence time of GSK126 under these conditions is simply too short to reliably quantitate enzymatically in our assay setup. Ultimately, this modified jump dilution methodology quickly became inadequate for our purposes as a result of continued increases in EZH2i residence times. This could not be circumvented by simply running longer reaction times due to the limited stability of SAM in aqueous buffers, and was further limited by our inability to accurately estimate compound IC50 values. In order to circumvent the limitations of using EZH2 catalytic readouts to estimate inhibitor residence times, we developed a time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay to directly measure free EZH2 as a function of time using a biotinylated EZH2 inhibitor that was designed based upon literature precedent (biotin-EZH2i, 4, Fig. 2A) (32Konze K.D. Ma A. Li F. Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Parton T. Macnevin C.J. Liu F. Gao C. Huang X.P. Kuznetsova E. Rougie M. Jiang A. Pattenden S.G. Norris J.L. James L.I. et al.An orally bioavailable chemical probe of the Lysine Methyltransferases EZH2 and EZH1.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The interaction between biotin-EZH2i and His-tagged PRC2 is detected using streptavidin allophycocyanin (SA-APC) and an Eu-αHis antibody (Fig. 2B). While the final, measured TR-FRET complex is identical to other standard TR-FRET-based binding assays, assay execution with this system is particularly nuanced. This nuance stems from the altered affinity and kinetics of the biotin probe when complexed with SA-APC. In order to avoid the altered equilibration time observed with the SA-APC:Biotin-EZH2i complex and PRC2, we explored the impact of order of addition on detection of free PRC2. In doing so, we identified conditions that result in effectively instantaneous equilibration between biotin-EZH2i and pre-equilibrated Eu-αHis:PRC2 complex. The SA-APC is then added at a concentration for which its saturation of the biotin-probe bound to EZH2 is also effectively instantaneous (Fig. S1, A and B). Under these conditions, we were able to quantitatively measure free PRC2 across a concentration range of 1.4–1000 pM with excellent linearity with respect to free PRC2 versus TR-FRET ratio. The signal and, accordingly, its linearity with respect to [PRC2], peaked between 5 and 10 min following SA-APC addition. Both signal and linearity were stable until ∼20 min post SA-APC addition. Peak linearity was achieved at 11 min following SA-APC addition (R2 > 0.99), thus providing an adequate window of time for reagent addition followed by signal readout (Fig. S2, A and B). We utilized this platform for detection of free EZH2 in two different schematics (Schemes SI and SII, respectively): (1) a jump dilution-based format to monitor dissociation of a prebound inhibitor over time to determine koff values and (2) a format to monitor compound association with EZH2 over time to determine kon values. For schematic 1, [PRC2] bound to inhibitor or inhibitor-bound fraction can be plotted versus time and fit to a single-phase exponential decay to determine koff (Fig. 2, C). Importantly, this can be run under dialysis conditions to ensure compound rebinding does not result in an overestimation of the drug-target residence time. Rebinding was found to be significant for EZH2i where τ > 100 h and for those compounds, only data under dialysis conditions is reported. Data treatment for schematic 2 requires additional nuance for accurate characterization (vide infra). An example compound titration using schematic 2 is shown in Figure 2D. We tested multiple compounds across multiple scaffolds with a range of koff values (determined using jump dilution procedure outlined in schematic 1). For each of the compounds tested, we observed a clear linear relationship in a plot of kobs versus [I] (Fig. S3). This relationship is indicative of a single-step binding mechanism (25Copeland R.A. The drug-target residence time model: A 10-year retrospective.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2016; 15: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 26Copeland R.A. Pompliano D.L. Meek T.D. Drug-target residence time and its implications for lead optimization.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 730-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), in contrast not only to the previously proposed two-step binding mechanism of slow-tight binding EZH2i, but also to many other characterized long residence time compounds for other protein targets (23Van Aller G.S. Pappalardi M.B. Ott H.M. Diaz E. Brandt M. Schwartz B.J. Miller W.H. Dhanak D. McCabe M.T. Verma S.K. Creasy C.L. Tummino P.J. Kruger R.G. Long residence time inhibition of EZH2 in activated polycomb repressive complex 2.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Copeland R.A. The drug-target residence time model: A 10-year retrospective.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2016; 15: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Further, the observed linear relationship of kobs versus [I] was not affected by allosteric activation of PRC2 using H3K27me3 activator peptide (Fig. S3, C and D). Finally, we corroborated this observation using both enzymatic methodologies and from the SPR data generated (Fig. S4). The final consideration for data treatment in these experiments stems from the fact that the concentrations of inhibitor used for our association experiments approach that of the total concentration of PRC2 in the sample, requiring treatments based on second-order reaction conditions. Thus, to obtain estimates of the kon values for the compounds tested, binding curves were fit to the integrated rate equation for a reversible, bimolecular association reaction. The solution to this has been presented numerous times in various forms, with the form used here shown in Supplementary Note II (https://www.researchgate.net/post/Any-literature-reference-for-the-kinetics-of-reversible-bimolecular-association/581b9f813d7f4be7e503a435/citation/download) (33McPherson R.A.

Simple integrated rate equations for reversible bimolecular reactions.Experientia. 1984; 40: 453-456Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We next compared the agreement of the kinetic parameters using our TR-FRET-based methodologies to the values obtained for the test set of compounds evaluated previously by SPR. All kinetic parameters were in excellent agreement between the two methodologies (Fig. 2, E and F), consequently producing similar estimates for compound-binding affinities (Ki, Fig. 2, G). Taken together, these results indicate that our TR-FRET-based methodology is suitable for accurately determining compound-PRC2 kinetic parameters and, therefore, binding affinity. Intriguingly, the aforementioned allosteric stimulation of EZH2 from H3K27me3 activator peptide has also been shown to modulate the residence time of EZH2 inhibitors (23Van Aller G.S. Pappalardi M.B. Ott H.M. Diaz E. Brandt M. Schwartz B.J. Miller W.H. Dhanak D. McCabe M.T. Verma S.K. Creasy C.L. Tummino P.J. Kruger R.G. Long residence time inhibition of EZH2 in activated polycomb repressive complex 2.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a phenomenon we also observed with compound 5 during the course of our mechanistic studies (Fig. S3, C and D). Utilizing our TR-FRET binding assay, we sought to explore this phenomenon across a panel of EZH2 inhibitors. We found that the residence time of every inhibitor increased, although the extent of increase was highly variable (Fig. 3, A). To date, we have not observed a clear SKR that can explain the selectivity for activated relative to basal PRC2, but we suspect it is related to the fact that pyridone-based EZH2i also interacts with the EED subunit as a result of their binding at an interface between EZH2-EED (16Bratkowski M.

Med. Chem. 2016; 59: 9928-9941Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Intrigued by the observed allosteric modulation of EZH2i residence time, we probed for residence time modulation of CPI-1205 by an EED small-molecule antagonist, MAK683. In contrast to experiments with activator peptide (Fig. 3, A), we did not observe an increase in the residence time of CPI-1205 by MAK683 (Fig. 3, B). Nonetheless, the presence of an EEDi negated residence time enhancement by addition of activator peptide (Fig. 3, C). Interestingly, these data directly indicate that EED-targeted small molecules and pyridone-containing EZH2 inhibitors can co-occupy the same PRC2 complex, providing the molecular basis for a simultaneous, orthogonal, PRC2-targeting approach. Notably, as expected from our MOI studies, there was no effect of allosteric stimulation of EZH2 on compound association kinetics (Fig. 3, D). In order to potentially gain insight into the biologically relevant PRC2 state, we compared cellular potencies of a panel of EZH2i with their residence time values obtained in the basal or activated state of PRC2. While we found a general correlation with both values, it was stronger with the H3K27me3 mark reduction EC50 values in HeLa cells for the compound residence times in the activated state, particularly for the most potent compounds in the panel, suggesting that activated PRC2 is the more biologically relevant state (Fig. 3, E and F). Therefore, our subsequent kinetic studies described here were conducted in the context of activated PRC2. We recently reported that, quite unexpectedly, the residence time of compound 2, the 4-thiomethyl analog of CPI-1205, (Fig. 4, A), displayed an order of magnitude increase in inhibitor residence time (29Khanna A.

In this study, optimization of temporal dose modulation based on the ODE equation is performed to explore the feasibility of improving GBM treatment outcome. Methods A non-convex optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the total cancer cell number while maintaining the normal tissue biological effective dose (BED normal ) at 100 Gy, equivalent to the conventional 2 Gy × 30 dosing scheme was formulated. With specified total number of dose fractions and treatment duration, the optimization was performed using a paired simulated annealing algorithm with fractional doses delivered to the CSC and DCC compartments and time intervals between fractions as variables. The recurrence time, defined as the time point at which the total tumor cell number regrows to 2.8×10 9 cells, was used to evaluate optimization outcome. Optimization was performed for conventional treatment time frames equivalent to currently and historically utilized fractionation schemes, in which limited improvement in recurrence time delay was observed. The efficacy of a super hyperfractionated approach with a prolonged treatment duration of one year was therefore tested, with both fixed regular and optimized variable time intervals between dose fractions corresponding to total number of fractions equivalent to weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly deliveries (n = 53, 27, 13). Optimization corresponding to BED normal of 150 Gy was also obtained to evaluate the possibility in further recurrence delay with dose escalation. Results For the super hyperfractionated schedules with dose fraction number equivalent to weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly deliveries, the recurrence time points were found to be 430.5, 423.9, and 413.3 days, respectively, significantly delayed compared with the recurrence time of 250.3 days from conventional fractionation. Results show that optimal outcome was achieved by first delivering infrequent fractions followed by dense once per day fractions in the middle and end of the treatment course, with sparse and low dose treatments in the between. The dose to the CSC compartment was held relatively constant throughout while larger dose fractions to the DCC compartment were observed in the beginning and final fractions that preceded large time intervals. Dose escalation to BED normal of 150 Gy was shown capable of further delaying recurrence time to 452 days. Conclusion The development and utilization of a temporal dose fractionation optimization framework in the context of CSC dynamics have demonstrated that substantial delay in GBM local tumor recurrence could be achieved with a super hyperfractionated treatment approach. Preclinical and clinical studies are needed to validate the efficacy of this novel treatment delivery method."

We evaluated 13 CRC cell lines, 84 fresh and 119 formalin-fixed CRC tissues (including 61 MSI-high CRCs and 155 microsatellite-stable CRCs) and tested the classification performance of the two methods on 23, 230, and 3,154 microsatellite markers. For the fresh tissue and cell line samples, mSILICO showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%, regardless of the number of panel markers, whereas for the formalin-fixed tissue samples, mSILICO exhibited a sensitivity of up to 100% and a specificity of up to 100% with three differently sized panels ranging from 23 to 3154. These results were similar to those of mSINGS. With the application of mSILICO, the small panel of 23 markers had a sensitivity of ≥95% and a specificity of 100% in cell lines/fresh tissues and formalin-fixed tissues of CRC. In conclusion, we developed a new computational method and microsatellite marker panels for the determination of MSI that does not require paired normal tissues. A small panel could be integrated into the targeted NGS panel for the concurrent analysis of single nucleotide variations and MSI."
https://openalex.org/W3129095941,"Polychlorinated bisphenols (PCBs) continue to contaminate food chains globally where they concentrate in tissues and disrupt the endocrine systems of species throughout the ecosphere. Hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) are major PCB metabolites and high-affinity inhibitors of human estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1), which sulfonates estrogens and thus prevents them from binding to and activating their receptors. OH-PCB inhibition of SULT1E1 is believed to contribute significantly to PCB-based endocrine disruption. Here, for the first time, the molecular basis of OH-PCB inhibition of SULT1E1 is revealed in a structure of SULT1E1 in complex with OH-PCB1 (4ʹ-OH-2,6-dichlorobiphenol) and its substrates, estradiol (E2), and PAP (3'-phosphoadenosine-5-phosphosulfate). OH-PCB1 prevents catalysis by intercalating between E2 and catalytic residues and establishes a new E2-binding site whose E2 affinity and positioning are greater than and competitive with those of the reactive-binding pocket. Such complexes have not been observed previously and offer a novel template for the design of high-affinity inhibitors. Mutating residues in direct contact with OH-PCB weaken its affinity without compromising the enzyme's catalytic parameters. These OH-PCB resistant mutants were used in stable transfectant studies to demonstrate that OH-PCBs regulate estrogen receptors in cultured human cell lines by binding the OH-PCB binding pocket of SULT1E1."

We hypothesized that M183L subunits may form mixed oligomers of native and mutant PfPNP monomers to give hybrid hexameric enzymes with properties conferring DADMe-ImmG resistance. To test this hypothesis, we designed PfPNP constructs that covalently linked native and the catalytically weak M183L mutant subunits. Engineered hybrid PfPNP yielded trimer-of-dimer hexameric protein with alternating native and catalytically weak M183L subunits. This hybrid PfPNP gave near-native Km values for substrate, but the affinity for DADMe-ImmG and catalytic efficiency were both reduced approximately ninefold relative to a similar construct of native subunits. Contact between the relatively inactive M183L and native subunits is responsible for altered properties of the hybrid protein. Thus, gene amplification of PfPNP provides adequate catalytic activity while resistance to DADMe-ImmG occurs in the hybrid oligomer to promote parasite survival. Coupled with the slow development of drug resistance, this resistance mechanism highlights the potential for DADMe-ImmG use in antimalarial combination therapies. Plasmodium falciparum purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PfPNP) catalyzes an essential step in purine salvage for parasite growth. 4′-Deaza-1′-Aza-2′-Deoxy-1′-(9-Methylene)-Immucillin-G (DADMe-ImmG) is a transition state analog inhibitor of this enzyme, and P. falciparum infections in an Aotus primate malaria model can be cleared by oral administration of DADMe-ImmG. P. falciparum cultured under increasing DADMe-ImmG drug pressure exhibited PfPNP gene amplification, increased protein expression, and point mutations involved in DADMe-ImmG binding. However, the weak catalytic properties of the M183L resistance mutation (∼17,000-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency) are inconsistent with the essential function of PfPNP.

Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of human malaria, a leading cause of mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. In 2018, malaria accounted for 67% of the mortality in children under the age of five (1WHOWorld Malaria Report. World Health Organization, Geneva2019Google Scholar, 2Blasco B. Leroy D. Fidock D.A.

The World Health Organization estimated that in 2018, approximately 228 million people were infected with malaria, causing 405,000 deaths (1WHOWorld Malaria Report.

DADMe-ImmG is a picomolar transition state analog (TSA) of PNP, which inhibits with a Kd of 670 pM and has an IC50 of 160 nM for parasites cultured in human erythrocytes (13Cassera M.B. Hazleton K.Z.

A. 2018; 115: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PfPNP in complex with DADMe-ImmG (PDB ID: 3PHC) shows hydrogen bond and ion-pair interactions with active site residues, phosphate, and structural waters (Fig. 1B). These interactions define the tight-binding nature of DADMe-ImmG compared with the substrate inosine (PBD ID: 2BSX) and explain why DADMe-ImmG is such a strong inhibitor of PfPNP. Resistance selection experiments indicated that PNP is the singular target for DADMe-ImmG. Resistance involves increased PNP protein expression and loss-of-function mutations occurring only in the PNP target enzyme (9Madrid D.C. Ting L.M. Waller K.L. Schramm V.L. Kim K.

Resistance to DADMe-ImmG develops slowly. After 1 year of drug pressure, modest resistance occurred as a consequence of threefold PfPNP gene amplification. Continued drug pressure for an additional 2 years led to additional gene amplification (up to 12 copies) and the acquisition of PfPNP catalytic site mutations (M183L and V181D) in separate clones. Of the 12-fold gene amplification, six copies of the amplified PNP gene were wild-type copies and with the other six copies corresponding to the mutant PNP (19Ducati R.G. Namanja-Magliano H.A. Harijan R.K. Fajardo J.E. Fiser A. Daily J.P. Schramm V.L. Genetic resistance to purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibition in Plasmodium falciparum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These amino acid mutations have not been previously reported for PfPNP and appear to be novel point mutations in response to DADMe-ImmG drug pressure. The V181D clone exhibited decreased affinity for DADMe-ImmG but retained sufficient catalytic activity to provide the essential PfPNP function (19Ducati R.G. Namanja-Magliano H.A. Harijan R.K. Fajardo J.E. Fiser A. Daily J.P. Schramm V.L. Genetic resistance to purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibition in Plasmodium falciparum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, the M183L mutant is severely compromised, displaying insufficient catalytic activity (a 17,000-fold decrease) to support the viability of the parasite (19Ducati R.G. Namanja-Magliano H.A. Harijan R.K. Fajardo J.E. Fiser A. Daily J.P. Schramm V.L. Genetic resistance to purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibition in Plasmodium falciparum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this clone, the coexpressed native PfPNP is fully susceptible to DADMe-ImmG inhibition. These parameters led to the hypothesis of hybrid native-M183L PfPNP oligomers with altered properties that provide biological function. Resistance against other antimalaria therapies is also known to develop via multiple mutational mechanisms. For example, PfKelch-13 mutations were reported to promote parasite survival through proteostatic regulation of other protein targets in artemisinin resistance and mutations and expression changes in P. falciparum P-glycoprotein homolog (PfPgh1) resulting in altered response to artemisin drugs (5Tilley L.

As most clinical antimalaria drugs were designed based on phenotypic susceptibility and not to interfere with a single molecular target, several common mechanisms of drug resistance occur for multiple antimalarials (23Fidock D.A.

Understanding the mechanism of drug resistance for a target-specific transition state analog informs therapeutic efficacy and potential measures to minimize resistance development. These include dosing schemes and multiple drug combinations to contain resistant strain development (28Haldar K. Bhattacharjee S. Safeukui I. Drug resistance in Plasmodium.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16: 156-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For example, understanding the mechanisms of artemisinin resistance led to the recommendation of piperaquine (PPQ) as a partner drug with artemisinin in the treatment and prevention of malaria in children and pregnant women who fail to respond to the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine combination (29Kakuru A.

In regions with developing artemisinin resistance, triple combination therapies are advised by combining dihydroatermisinin–PPQ with mefloquine and artemether–lumifantrine with amodiaquine to combat the delay of parasite elimination, another hallmark of artemisinin resistance (28Haldar K.

Here we explore the compensatory mechanisms underlying the slow development of resistance to DADMe-ImmG. Low catalytic activity made it clear that the M183L mutation alone in PNP is incompatible with parasite survival. Genomic sequencing of the resistant parasites revealed that the M183L mutation was present in approximately one-half of the sequencing reads with the other half representing native PfPNP copies. The crystal structure of PfPNP shows a homohexamer with a trimer-of-dimer structure (Fig. 2; PDB ID: 1NW4). Because the point mutants are present in half of the sequences, we hypothesized that a hybrid expression of native and mutant subunits may be driving resistance. We engineered a fusion protein with native and M183L subunits covalently linked with a peptide linker (mutPNPfus). The enzymatic characterization of this hybrid protein revealed different kinetic properties from the parent protein and demonstrated that amplification of both native and M183L genes permits formation of hybrid PfPNP oligomers to provide an unusual resistance mechanism against DADMe-ImmG. We discuss the probability of such mutations arising in malaria therapy. PfPNP is a homohexamer with a trimer-of-dimer conformation (Fig. 2). The M183L mutation occurs between the catalytic site and the subunit interface, altering the geometry of the catalytic site to relocate Tyr160 into the catalytic site and thus interfere with both catalysis and the binding of DADMe-ImmG (Fig. 1). Crystallization studies with the M183L mutant yielded crystals without inhibitor in the catalytic site, consistent with the weak catalytic activity and weak inhibitor binding of M183L PfPNP (19Ducati R.G. Namanja-Magliano H.A. Harijan R.K. Fajardo J.E. Fiser A. Daily J.P. Schramm V.L. Genetic resistance to purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibition in Plasmodium falciparum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the DADMe-ImmG-resistant parasites expressing M183L PfPNP, half the genomic sequences expressed native enzyme, therefore we hypothesized that resistance was achieved by formation of hybrid hexamers of PfPNP containing combinations of native and mutant subunits. The trimer-of-dimer structure of PfPNP enabled the design of covalently linked C-terminus of the native subunits to the N-terminus of the M183L subunits with a 20 amino acid peptide linker (ASGAGGSEGGGSEGGTSGAT) (mutPNPfus) for expression in E. coli (Fig. 2). The glycine and serine-rich peptide linker was selected as it is known to provide a flexible linker. In native PfPNP, N and C termini are 50 Å apart and the extended length of the linker peptide is 70 Å. We proposed that this linked heterodimer would form a hybrid hexamer consisting of the cross-linked dimer unit with alternating native and M183L subunits. After expression and purification, we investigated the oligomer conformation of the fusion protein using nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, where the fusion protein migrated similar to native PfPNP, establishing that native and hybrid fusion PfPNPs have the same hexameric organization (Fig. 2). The catalytic activity of M183L PfPNP, where each subunit carries the M183L mutation, has been reported to be insufficient to support the essential function of PfPNP in vivo (19Ducati R.G. Namanja-Magliano H.A. Harijan R.K. Fajardo J.E. Fiser A. Daily J.P. Schramm V.L. Genetic resistance to purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibition in Plasmodium falciparum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The catalytic properties of the mutPNPfus enzyme were characterized for comparison to native, all-M183L PfPNP and cross-linked native PfPNP (natPNPfus) using Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The natPNPfus construct provided a control for the kinetic parameters altered by the cross-linking. It was obtained by expressing a fusion protein of covalently linked native PfPNP subunits with the same cross-linker sequence and also maintained hexameric oligomer structure (Fig. S1). The Km values for native PfPNP, natPNPfus, and mutPNPfus were similar at 7.6, 5.4, and 11 μM, respectively (Fig. 3). natPNPfus is catalytically slower than native PfPNP, with kcat values of 0.09 and 2.6 s−1, respectively. However, the natPNPfus construct serves as a control for the fusion construct carrying alternating native and M183L subunits (mutPNPfus). PfPNP has a catalytic site functional group near the N-terminus, His7. It orients the 5'-hydroxyl group of the substrate to form an electrostatic interaction with the ribosyl 4’-hydroxyl group to facilitate formation of the ribocationic transition state (Fig. 1) (15Lewandowicz A. Schramm V.L. Transition state analysis for human and Plasmodium falciparum purine nucleoside phosphorylases.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Native PfPNP has a robust kcat/Km of 3.5 × 105 M−1s−1. Fully mutated M183L PfPNP is functionally inert relative to native PfPNP, with the Km value increased 780-fold, and the kcat decreased 33-fold for a kcat/Km of 20 M−1s−1, a 17,000-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (19Ducati R.G.

A. 2018; 115: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The catalytic defect arises from the consequences of Tyr160 entering the catalytic site to hinder substrate entry (Fig. 1). This mutation also eliminates tight binding of the DADMe-ImmG transition state analog, increasing the dissociation constant from 670 pM in native PfPNP to 26 μM in M183L PfPNP, a factor of 39,000 (19Ducati R.G.

The mutation has made the subunit resistant to inhibition by DADMe-ImmG, but it has also rendered the enzyme to be catalytically weakened. When PfPNP native and M183L subunits are coexpressed in resistant P. falciparum parasites, hybrids can form, exemplified here by mutPNPfus with alternating native and M183L subunits. The structural control for the linked-subunit construct compares linked native PfPNP (natPNPfus) with linked, alternating native PfPNP and M183L subunits (mutPNPfus). In this comparison, the kcat value for mutPNPfus is 4.5-fold slower than natPNPfus, and the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) differ by a factor of 9. With 12-fold gene amplification (approximately equal expression of native and M183L sequences), the catalytic potential is similar to the parent parasite. Excess target expression is of limited biological value if the hybrid oligomers remain equally sensitive to DADMe-ImmG inhibition, therefore we quantitated the inhibitor action. DADMe-ImmG is a transition state analog of native PfPNP and induces a slow-onset isomerization process leading to the formation of a tight-binding enzyme-inhibitor complex with a final dissociation constant of 670 pM (Fig. 4; (33Li C.M.

The slow-onset inhibition is experimentally observed in inhibition kinetics with a large excess of substrate that is replaced by the tight binding of transition state analog (Fig. 4). Inhibition curves of natPNPfus revealed a distinct two-phase inhibition (Fig. 4B), with near-complete inhibition following slow-onset at 100 nM DADMe-ImmG. In contrast, the mutPNPfus displayed a less pronounced slow-onset phase and weaker inhibition by DADMe-ImmG (Fig. 4A). A feature of tight-binding inhibition assays is that inhibitor and enzyme concentrations are often similar and tight binding to the enzyme partitions a significant fraction of total inhibitor onto the enzyme, a characteristic included in the affinity calculations using the Morrison equation for tight-binding inhibitors (Equation 1) (35Morrison J.F.

Previous studies have shown that sterol homeostasis is regulated by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Two E3 ubiquitin ligases, Hrd1 and Doa10, are known to mediate the proteasomal degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase Hmg2 and squalene epoxidase Erg1 with accumulation of the toxic sterols in cells, but the deubiquitinases (DUBs) involved are unclear. Here, we screened for DUBs responsible for sterol homeostasis using yeast strains from a DUB-deletion library. The defective growth observed in ubp3-deleted (ubp3Δ) yeast upon fluconazole treatment suggests that lack of Ubp3 disrupts sterol homeostasis. Deep-coverage quantitative proteomics reveals that ergosterol biosynthesis is rerouted into a sterol pathway that generates toxic products in the absence of Ubp3. Further genetic and biochemical analysis indicated that Ubp3 enhances the proteasome's ability to degrade the ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes Erg1 and Erg3. The retardation of ergosterol enzyme degradation in the ubp3Δ strain resulted in the severe accumulation of the intermediate lanosterol and a branched toxic sterol, and ultimately disrupted sterol homeostasis and led to the fluconazole susceptibility.

Sterols, such as the cholesterol found in animals and the ergosterol in fungi, are essential for sustaining the structure and properties of cellular membranes, such as fluidity and rigidity (1Brown M.S.

The intermediate and the final products in cholesterol/ergosterol biosynthetic pathway are precursors of many steroid hormones or terpenoids that are essential for cell survival. A large number of studies have shown that the dysregulation of sterol homeostasis can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases in humans and antifungal resistance in fungi (2Goldstein J.L.

In fungi, the biosynthesis of ergosterol is tightly regulated by a cascade of enzymes encoded by a group of ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes (Erg genes). These enzymes can be assigned to three pathways: the “early” mevalonate pathway, the “late” ergosterol pathway, and the “alternate” branched toxic sterol pathway (5Bhattacharya S. Esquivel B.D.

Brown M.S. Regulation of the mevalonate pathway.Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4434) Google Scholar). Enzymes of the mevalonate pathway control the conversion of acetyl-CoA to farnesyl pyrophosphate. Among them, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductases Hmg1 and Hmg2 are rate-limiting enzymes (3Espenshade P.J. Hughes A.L. Regulation of sterol synthesis in eukaryotes.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Enzymes of the ergosterol pathway are responsible for the biosynthesis of ergosterol from squalene, and some of them are chosen as targets for antifungal drug designing. Among them, the squalene epoxidase Erg1 and the lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase Erg11 are rate-limiting enzymes. Azoles, such as fluconazole, can inhibit the activity of Erg11 and redirect the metabolic flux to the toxic sterol pathway (5Bhattacharya S. Esquivel B.D. White T.C.

At protein level, a key mechanism in sterol homeostasis involves the ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation of Erg enzymes in a sterol-dependent manner (20Nakatsukasa K. Okumura F.

The overaccumulation of geranylgernayl pyrophosphate and lanosterol would feedback to induce the proteasomal degradation of Hmg2 and Erg1, respectively. The E3 ubiquitin ligases, Hrd1 and Doa10, control the sterol-dependent degradation of Hmg2 and Erg1, respectively, through the endoplasmic reticulum–associated protein degradation pathway (13Burg J.S.

Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). However, the deubiquitination machinery and the identity of deubiquitinases (DUBs) for sterol homeostasis remain unclear. Herein, we identified a novel DUB, namely Ubp3, that promotes the degradation of Erg enzymes in yeast through enhancing the ability of proteasome. In ubp3Δ yeast, an increased level of Erg enzyme triggers the accumulation of intermediate lanosterol and toxic sterols, rendering the strain sensitive to fluconazole. Our finding shed new light on the role of Ubp3 in sterol homeostasis and its potential as an antifungal therapeutic target. In yeast, there are 21 DUBs that belong to five families (23Mevissen T.E. Komander D. Mechanisms of deubiquitinase specificity and regulation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 159-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To identify DUBs responsible for regulating sterol homeostasis, we systematically compared susceptibility of 19 single DUB deletion strains, excluding the newly identified MIY1 (24Abdul Rehman S.A. Kristariyanto Y.A. Choi S.Y. Nkosi P.J. Weidlich S. Labib K. Hofmann K. Kulathu Y.

Xu P.

On synthetic complete (SC) media, the growth of ubp3Δ and ubp15Δ strains was slightly poorer than that of WT. No obvious effects were observed in other strains (Fig. 1A, left). In the presence of fluconazole stress that blocked the activity of Erg11, ubp3Δ and ubp15Δ strains exhibited serious growth defect when compared with WT, indicating that these DUBs might be involved in regulating sterol homeostasis (Fig. 1A, middle and right). Among them, the growth defect of ubp3Δ was most severe (Fig. 1B). We also tried replacing fluconazole with three other antifungal agents, including terbinafine and liranaftate, that target Erg1 and amphotericin B that bind with ergosterol (8Cowen L.E. Steinbach W.J. Stress, drugs, and evolution: The role of cellular signaling in fungal drug resistance.Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 747-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The results showed that ubp15Δ responded to all three antifungal agents at varying degrees and ubp14Δ was sensitive to terbinafine (Fig. S1). However, ubp3Δ was insensitive to all three antifungal agents (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1), suggesting its specificity to fluconazole. The IC50 value of ubp3Δ was 5.7 μg/ml, which was about one-third of that (18.2 μg/ml) of WT strain (Fig. 1C). The growth curves in SC media with or without fluconazole also verified the growth defect in ubp3Δ strain, and the phenotype was rescued after Ubp3 was re-expressed in ubp3Δ (Fig. 1D). These results supported that Ubp3 was required for fluconazole resistance and might be involved in maintaining the sterol homeostasis in yeast cells. Previous studies have shown that the proteomes of WT and ubp3Δ differ by 30% (26Isasa M. Rose C.M. Elsasser S. Navarrete-Perea J. Paulo J.A. Finley D.J. Gygi S.P.

Proteomics. 2012; 75: 3886-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This makes the study of fluconazole resistance in ubp3Δ particularly challenging, as most of the changes in proteome might indirectly affect the sensitivity of the strains to fluconazole stress. To reduce experimental errors, we used a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) label-swap approach that combined high-resolution peptide fractionation with off-line high-pH LC and LC–MS/MS platform to compare the proteome difference between WT and ubp3Δ before and after fluconazole treatment (Fig. 2A). Our deep-coverage proteomics platform (28Li Y. Dammer E.B. Gao Y. Lan Q. Villamil M.A. Duong D.M. Zhang C. Ping L. Lauinger L. Flick K. Xu Z. Wei W. Xing X. Chang L. Jin J. et al.Proteomics links ubiquitin chain topology change to transcription factor activation.Mol. Cell. 2019; 76: 126-137.e127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) allowed us to quantify all the 25 Erg enzymes in the ergosterol pathway (Fig. 2B and Table S3). Surprisingly, deletion of UBP3 led to accumulation of nearly half of the enzymes involved in ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, especially those in the late ergosterol and toxic sterol pathways (Fig. 2B). Among them, 10 enzymes showed significant upregulation, whereas only two showed slight downregulation (Fig. 2B). The difference in protein abundance of these upregulated Erg enzymes between ubp3Δ and WT was further increased in the presence of fluconazole, indicating that Ubp3 plays a critical role in regulating the stability of the enzymes in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathways. Erg1, the first enzyme of ergosterol pathway (late), showed the largest accumulation in ubp3Δ (Fig. 2B), and our observation was further supported by tryptic peptide intensity measurements (Fig. S2). The loss of Ubp3 also resulted in the accumulation of Erg11, an enzyme in the bifurcation node of the ergosterol pathway (late) and toxic sterol pathways, which disagrees with the previous study that its upregulation contributed to fluconazole resistance (29Sanglard D. Coste A. Ferrari S. Antifungal drug resistance mechanisms in fungal pathogens from the perspective of transcriptional gene regulation.FEMS Yeast Res. 2009; 9: 1029-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To examine if the accumulation of Erg enzymes was directly regulated by Ubp3, we picked three key Erg enzymes of ergosterol and branched toxic sterol pathways, namely Erg1, Erg3, and Erg11, for further investigation. The levels of these Erg enzymes in ubp3Δ, Ubp3 complementary strain, and the catalytically inactive Ubp3 (C469A) complementary strain were compared using SILAC (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3). The results showed that these three enzymes were downregulated in the Ubp3 complementary strain but not in the Ubp3–C469A (Fig. 2C). Quantitative RT-PCR results showed little difference in the relative mRNA levels of ERG1, ERG3, and ERG11 between ubp3Δ and WT strains, regardless of fluconazole treatment (Fig. S4). These results suggest that the abundance of Erg enzymes is unlikely to be regulated on the mRNA level. Thus, in contrast to the general notion that DUBs stabilize proteins (30Kvint K. Uhler J.P. Taschner M.J. Sigurdsson S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Reversal of RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation by the ubiquitin protease Ubp3.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 498-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Ubp3 might play an unexpected role in promoting the degradation of Erg enzymes in a deubiquitination activity–dependent manner. To confirm the regulation of Ubp3 on the stability of Erg enzymes, the turnover rates of Erg enzymes in WT and ubp3Δ were measured using pulse-chase SILAC approach (21Christiano R. Nagaraj N. Frohlich F. Walther T.C. Global proteome turnover analyses of the yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 1959-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Schwanhausser B. Busse D.

Global quantification of mammalian gene expression control.Nature. 2011; 473: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (3755) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The result showed that the degradative rates of accumulated Erg enzymes, such as Erg1, Erg3, and Erg11, in ubp3Δ cells were significantly lower than those of WT (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, deletion of Ubp3 had no effect on the half-lives or abundance of other enzymes in this pathway, such as Erg9, Erg10, and Erg27 (Figs. 2B and 3C). We also validated this phenomenon with a His6-biotin–tagged Erg1 and Erg3 in pdr5Δ background (Fig. 3, D and E). These results suggest that Ubp3 promotes the degradation of a subset of Erg enzymes under normal condition. Previous study has suggested that the sterol homeostasis is regulated by a feedback inhibition in an ubiquitination-dependent degradation manner (20Nakatsukasa K. Okumura F. Kamura T. Proteolytic regulation of metabolic enzymes by E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes: Lessons from yeast.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2015; 50: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Lanosterol accumulation induced by fluconazole could enhance the degradation of its upstream enzyme Erg1, which in turn reduces the biosynthesis of lanosterol to maintain the sterol homeostasis (14Foresti O. Ruggiano A. Hannibal-Bach H.K. Ejsing C.S. Carvalho P. Sterol homeostasis requires regulated degradation of squalene monooxygenase by the ubiquitin ligase Doa10/Teb4.Elife. 2013; 2e00953Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that Ubp3 promotes the degradation of Erg enzymes in the presence of fluconazole, the abundances of the key Erg enzymes were compared before and after fluconazole treatment by Western blotting (Fig. 4). As expected, fluconazole treatment resulted in a significant decrease of Erg1 in WT strain, which reflected the feedback signal. Similar decrease was observed in phenotype of Erg3 protein levels in WT implying the same regulatory machinery for Erg1 and Erg3 (Fig. 4, C and D). Fluconazole treatment might divert lanosterol into the biosynthesis of toxic sterols, in which Erg3 acts as the key enzyme (5Bhattacharya S. Esquivel B.D. White T.C. Overexpression or deletion of ergosterol biosynthesis genes alters doubling time, response to stress agents, and drug susceptibility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.mBio. 2018; 9e01291-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We speculated that the accumulation of toxic sterol could also induce the feedback signal to increase the degradation of its upstream enzyme Erg3. This is a novel feedback signal that was induced by the toxic sterol besides lanosterol and geranylgernayl pyrophosphate. Moreover, the accelerated degradation of Erg1 and Erg3, where both were arrested in ubp3Δ cells (Fig. 4, A–D), suggested that Ubp3 might participate in this feedback inhibition by facilitating their degradation. The results are consistent with those obtained using SILAC-based quantitative proteomics (Fig. 2A and Fig. S5). These results further support the large ratios of Erg1 and Erg3 between ubp3Δ and WT strains treated with fluconazole (Fig. 2B). In addition, the absence of Ubp3 also significantly upregulated the ubiquitinated forms of Erg1 and Erg3 regardless of fluconazole incubation or not (Fig. 4, A and C) but did not increase their unstability to decrease the whole amount of Erg enzymes. These results indicated that the loss of Ubp3 did not block the ubiquitination process of Erg proteins but did affect the degradation process of its ubiquitinated form. Given that both Hrd1 and Doa10 were required for the accelerated degradation of key Erg enzymes induced by sterol intermediates (14Foresti O. Ruggiano A. Hannibal-Bach H.K. Ejsing C.S. Carvalho P.

Our data from the SILAC-based quantitative proteomics showed that lack of Ubp3 had no impact on the levels of Hrd1 and Doa10, which were not changed by fluconazole as well (Fig. 2A and Fig. S6). Therefore, the absence of Ubp3 could not affect the abundance of key Erg enzymes through altering the protein level of E3s, which mediated their degradation. We thus speculated that Ubp3 was required for the feedback control of the degradation of Erg1 and Erg3 induced by fluconazole treatment, and loss of Ubp3 inhibited their degradation and blocked the feedback signal. We also measured protein turnover rates of Erg1 and Erg3 in WT and ubp3Δ without or with fluconazole treatment after protein translation is blocked by cycloheximide (CHX) (32Edwards P.A. Gould R.G. Turnover rate of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase as determined by use of cycloheximide.J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1520-1524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Harvested yeast cells at indicated time points after CHX incubation, lysed and took equal amounts of total cell lysates for SDS-PAGE separation. The slices that contained Erg1 and Erg3 based on the molecular weight were cut for further LC–MS/MS analysis (Fig. S7A). We found that fluconazole treatment promoted the degradation of Erg1 and Erg3 in WT but not in ubp3Δ (Fig. 5, A–D). Therefore, Ubp3 was required for the feedback signal by accelerating the degradation of Erg1 and Erg3 during fluconazole stimulation. To investigate the physiological role of proteasome on these Erg enzymes, we analyzed the levels of these proteins after proteasome inhibition. Similar to ubp3Δ, treatment with PS341, an inhibitor of proteasome, led to significant accumulations in both Erg1 and Erg3 in WT cells, indicating their proteasomal degradations (Fig. 6A). The fluconazole-induced degradation of Erg1 and Erg3 was blocked by PS341 treatment in WT strain (Fig. 6B), suggesting that fluconazole promotes their degradations through proteasomes. Similar accumulation phenomenon of Erg1 and Erg3 in PS341-treated WT yeast and ubp3Δ, with and without fluconazole treatment, implied that Ubp3 absence disturbed their proteasomal degradation. To clarify the relationship among Ubp3, Erg enzymes, and proteasome, the protein–protein interactions among Ubp3, the two Erg enzymes, and proteasome were examined. Ubp3 that was either C-terminally tagged with tandem 6× histidine and biotin (Ubp3-HB) or free of HB (control) was expressed in ubp3Δ (Fig. S8A and Table S1). After subjecting total cell lysates to tandem affinity purification (TAP) under native conditions, the purified Ubp3 interactome was analyzed by LC–MS/MS (Fig. S8B). As expected, Bre5, a cofactor of Ubp3 (33Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Ubp3 requires a cofactor, Bre5, to specifically de-ubiquitinate the COPII protein, Sec23.Nat.

We have previously shown that NAD(H) promotes the assembly of similar tetramers from either human CtBP1 and CtBP2 and that CtBP2 tetramer destabilizing mutants are defective for oncogenic activity. To assist structure-based design efforts for compounds that disrupt CtBP tetramerization, it is essential to understand how NAD(H) triggers tetramer assembly. Here, we investigate the moieties within NAD(H) that are responsible for triggering tetramer formation. Using multiangle light scattering (MALS), we show that ADP is able to promote tetramer formation of both CtBP1 and CtBP2, whereas AMP promotes tetramer assembly of CtBP1, but not CtBP2. Other NAD(H) moieties that lack the adenosine phosphate, including adenosine and those incorporating nicotinamide, all fail to promote tetramer assembly. Our crystal structures of CtBP1 with AMP reveal participation of the adenosine phosphate in the tetrameric interface, pinpointing its central role in NAD(H)-linked assembly. CtBP1 and CtBP2 have overlapping but unique roles, suggesting that a detailed understanding of their unique structural properties might have utility in the design of paralog-specific inhibitors. We investigated the different responses to AMP through a series of site-directed mutants at 13 positions. These mutations reveal a central role for a hinge segment, which we term the 120s hinge that connects the substrate with coenzyme-binding domains and influences nucleotide binding and tetramer assembly. Our results provide insight into suitable pockets to explore in structure-based drug design to interfere with cotranscriptional activity of CtBP in cancer.

Here we explore the moieties within NAD(H) that are responsible for promoting tetrameric assembly. Our multiangle light scattering (MALS) data show that ADP promotes tetrameric assembly in CtBP1 and CtBP2, whereas AMP promotes tetrameric assembly for only CtBP1. By mutagenesis, we pinpoint the basis for different AMP responses between the two paralogs to a short segment that both connects the two subdomains and participates in the tetrameric interface. Moieties of NAD(H) lacking the adenosine phosphate are unable to promote tetrameric assembly. To understand the structural basis for AMP-linked assembly of CtBP1, we determined the crystal structure of CtBP1 with AMP, which reveals a direct interaction involving the adenosine phosphate in tetramer formation. Thus, this phosphate is critical for the response of CtBP to binding of NAD(H). To ascertain the basis for NAD(H)-linked tetramer formation, the level of assembly of CtBP1 and CtBP2 in the presence of NAD(H) moieties (Fig. S1) was investigated by MALS of samples eluting from a size-exclusion column (SEC). (NAD(H) refers to either NADH or NAD+.) Previously we demonstrated, also with SEC-MALS, the linkage between NAD(H) and tetrameric assembly of CtBP1 and CtBP2 (41Bellesis A.G. Jecrois A.M. Hayes J.A.

Chem. 2018; 293: 9101-9112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), CtBP1 is primarily tetrameric in the presence of 10 μM NADH and 10 μM NAD+, with weight average mass (Mw) of 172 and 169 kDa, respectively. Additionally, 1 mM ADP and 1 mM AMP also exhibit early elution and high molecular masses (Mw = 167–173 kDa). CtBP1 in the presence of the other tested compounds elutes later and shows molecular mass values of 111–128 kDa, similar to CtBP1 in the absence of any NAD moiety (128 kDa). The observed molecular masses indicate heterogeneous mixtures, primarily of 94 Da dimers and 188 kDa tetramers. Given that light scattering provides weight average molecular mass estimates (Mw) (43Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971Google Scholar), one can calculate approximate molar fractions of dimers and tetramers, assuming that those are the only species contributing to the light scattering (see Experimental procedures). Based on these assumptions, CtBP1 in NADH, NAD+, AMP, and ADP is approximately 64–73% tetrameric, whereas in the other tested compounds, CtBP1 is 10–23% tetrameric for the data shown in Figure 1 (Table S1). The elution volumes and MALS molecular mass values for CtBP2 show a similar pattern to those for CtBP1, with the notable exception of the response to AMP. In the presence of 10 μM NADH, 10 μM NAD+, and 1 mM ADP, the MALS measured molecular masses for CtBP2 are 169–176 kDa. CtBP2 in the presence of 1 mM AMP exhibits a MALS molecular mass of 132 kDa, only slightly higher than in the absence of any NAD moiety and much lower than with 1 mM ADP. For the the other tested compounds, the molecular masses range from 121 to 129 kDa, similar to 129 kDa for CtBP2 in the absence of any NAD moiety. Estimating the fractions of dimer and tetramer as described above, CtBP2 in NADH, NAD+, and ADP under these conditions is 63–73% tetramer. For the other tested compounds, CtBP2 is estimated to be 15–24% tetramer (Table S1). Previously we demonstrated that NADH and NAD+ promote tetrameric assembly of CtBP1 and CtBP2 with apparent EC50 values in the range of 50–150 nM (41Bellesis A.G. Jecrois A.M. Hayes J.A. Schiffer C.A. Royer Jr., W.E. Assembly of human C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) into tetramers.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 9101-9112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As discussed above, ADP promotes the tetrameric assembly of CtBP1 and CtBP2, whereas AMP promotes the tetrameric assembly of CtBP1. Figure 2 shows the measured MALS Mw values for CtBP1 and CtBP2 as a function of ADP and AMP concentration. (Individual results along with additional replicates are provided in Table S2.) Fitting the molecular mass dependence on ADP concentration (see Experimental procedures) indicates Mw values of 120 kDa and 126 kDa for CtBP1 and CtBP2, respectively, at low ADP concentrations rising to 170 kDa and 171 kDa at high ADP concentration for the measured conditions. The fitting yields an EC50 value for the effect of ADP promoting tetramer formation of about 52 μM for CtBP1 and 43 μM for CtBP2. Fitting the data for AMP yields an EC50 value of about 66 μM for CtBP1. Thus, although ADP and AMP (for CtBP1) promote tetramer formation as does NAD(H), the concentrations of AMP and ADP required for tetrameric assembly are approximately three orders of magnitude higher than required for NAD(H). The inability of those NAD moieties that lack adenosine phosphate to promote CtBP tetramer formation could result from a lack of binding or binding that does not induce structural changes that stabilize tetramers. To test for specific binding, we investigated the ability of these compounds to interfere with NADH-linked tetramerization. Figure 3 shows SEC/MALS results for CtBP1 and CtBP2 in the presence of 50 nM NADH (slightly below the EC50 for tetramer formation (41Bellesis A.G. Jecrois A.M. Hayes J.A. Schiffer C.A. Royer Jr., W.E. Assembly of human C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) into tetramers.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 9101-9112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). Under these conditions, the MALS determined molecular masses of 128 kDa and 134 kDa for CtBP1 and CtBP2, suggesting approximately 22% and 25% tetramer, respectively. Addition of 2 mM adenosine reduces the molecular masses by 9 kDa, lowering the estimated tetramer fractions to 15% and 18%, respectively. Thus, adenosine is able to interfere with NADH-linked tetramer assembly, presumably by direct binding, which highlights the importance of the adenosine phosphate to promote tetramer formation. (The effect of adenosine showing lower MALS Mw values is also evident in Figure 1, suggesting a very small amount of residual bound NAD(H) may be present in those experiments, see below.) This series of experiments provides evidence that nicotinamide ribose and nicotinamide may also interfere with tetramer formation, but only to a very small extent. Although slight, the differences do appear to be reproducible (Table S3). These results suggest that adenosine, along with possibly nicotinamide and nicotinamide ribose, inhibits NADH-linked tetrameric assembly of CtBP by binding in the NADH pocket, albeit at much lower affinity. Thus, binding into the adenosine or nicotinamide ribose pockets is not sufficient to cause tetrameric assembly unless the adenosine phosphate is present. Our earlier crystal structures of CtBP1 and CtBP2 showed that the adenosine phosphate of NAD(H) interacts with a conserved Arg (184 in CtBP1, 190 in CtBP2), which then participates in a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asp 209′/215′ (CtBP1/CtBP2, primes designate a residue in a partner subunit) across the tetrameric interface (41Bellesis A.G. Jecrois A.M. Hayes J.A. Schiffer C.A. Royer Jr., W.E. Assembly of human C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) into tetramers.J. Biol.

(The similarity of this interaction in CtBP1 and CtBP2 is shown in Fig. S2.) To ascertain if AMP promotes tetramer assembly of CtBP1 in a similar fashion, we determined the crystal structure of CtBP1 (28–375) in complex with AMP at 2.45 Å resolution (Fig. 4A). (Crystallization of CtBP1 required the removal of the last 65 residues (41Bellesis A.G. Jecrois A.M. Hayes J.A. Schiffer C.A. Royer Jr., W.E. Assembly of human C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) into tetramers.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 9101-9112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); CtBP1 (28–375) shows similar AMP-dependent tetramerization as does CtBP1 (28–440), Table S2.) As discussed in Experimental procedures, careful purification of CtBP1 (28–375) in the presence of 5 mM AMP was required to completely remove bound NAD(H) that is apparently acquired during expression in E. coli. Eventual success became clear from crystallographic analysis showing the electron density for AMP (Fig. 4B) but no observable density for the remainder of the NAD(H) cofactor. The cocrystal structure of AMP bound to CtBP1 (28–375) confirms that AMP binds nearly identically to the AMP portion of NADH. In particular, the adenosine phosphate maintains charge-stabilized hydrogen bonding with Arg 184, which then forms a hydrogen bond across the tetrameric interface with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Asp 209 (Fig. 4B), which is nearly identical to that observed in CtBP1 and CtBP2 bound to NAD(H) (Fig. S2). Our finding that AMP triggers tetramer formation, but adenosine interferes with NADH-linked tetrameric assembly (Fig. 3), demon"

While research on the mental health of ASCs is increasing, less is known about their day-to-day living experiences such as their daily mood, sleep patterns, and post-migration factors. Moreover, no examination in situ , using smartphone-assisted ecological momentary assessment (EMA), has been conducted up to now among ASCs. Furthermore, we do not know if screening measures succeed in reflecting the daily mood of ASCs experienced in everyday life. Methods We undertook a smartphone-assisted EMA study over a two-week period with 3 measurements a day. Participants were N = 40 ASCs from 10 different countries who had resettled to Germany. They completed standardized questionnaires screening for history of trauma and clinical symptoms (post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression, and anxiety) that were carried out in interview-like settings, and they participated in the subsequent EMA where they rated mood, sleep parameters, and post-migration factors on a daily basis. Multilevel models of clinical symptoms, daily mood, and sleep parameters were computed based on a total of 680 measurements. Results The multiply traumatized and highly distressed participants reported different levels of discrimination, and various social activities and contacts in the EMA. The overall compliance rate was shown to be 40.5%. Higher PTSS and anxiety scores were associated with lower levels of daily mood and poorer outcomes of some sleep parameters. Depression scores were not associated with any of the variables assessed in the EMA. Conclusions Smartphone-assisted EMA among ASCs resettled to Germany proved to be implementable despite a rather low compliance rate. Not only do ASCs show high symptom levels, they are also affected by these symptoms in their daily lives. The results emphasize the need for concise screenings and psychological treatment for this high-risk population. Limitations include the convenient nature of the sample and the lack of a comparison group."
https://openalex.org/W3128546510,"A low-sodium (LS) diet has been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. However, severe dietary sodium restriction promotes insulin resistance (IR) and dyslipidemia in animal models and humans. Thus, further clarification of the long-term consequences of LS is needed. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic LS on gastrocnemius gene and protein expression and lipidomics and its association with IR and plasma lipids in LDL receptor knockout mice. Three-month-old male mice were fed a normal sodium diet (NS; 0.5% Na; n = 12-19) or LS (0.06% Na; n = 14-20) over 90 days. Body mass (BM), BP, plasma total cholesterol, triacylglycerol (TG), glucose, hematocrit, and IR were evaluated. LS increased BM (9%), plasma TG (51%), blood glucose (19%), and IR (46%) when compared with the NS. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that genes involved in lipid uptake and oxidation were increased by the LS: Fabp3 (106%), Prkaa1 (46%), and Cpt1 (74%). Genes and proteins (assessed by Western blotting) involved in insulin signaling were not changed by the LS. Similarly, lipid species classically involved in muscle IR, such as diacylglycerols and ceramides detected by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, were also unchanged by LS. Species of phosphatidylcholines (68%), phosphatidylinositol (90%), and free fatty acids (59%) increased while cardiolipins (41%) and acylcarnitines (9%) decreased in gastrocnemius in response to LS and were associated with glucose disposal rate. Together these results suggest that chronic LS alters glycerophospholipid and fatty acids species in gastrocnemius that may contribute to glucose and lipid homeostasis derangements in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3127102593,"Introduction Regional anesthesia offers an alternative to general anesthesia and may be advantageous in low resource environments. There is a paucity of data regarding the practice of regional anesthesia in low- and middle-income countries. Using access data from a free Android app with curated regional anesthesia learning modules, we aimed to estimate global interest in regional anesthesia and potential applications to clinical practice stratified by World Bank income level. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data collected from the free Android app “Anesthesiologist” from December 2015 to April 2020. The app performs basic anesthetic calculations and provides links to videos on performing 12 different nerve blocks. Users of the app were classified on the basis of whether or not they had accessed the links. Nerve blocks were also classified according to major use (surgical block, postoperative pain adjunct, rescue block). Results Practitioners in low- and middle-income countries accessed the app more frequently than in high-income countries as measured by clicks. Users from low- and middle-income countries focused mainly on surgical blocks: ankle, axillary, infraclavicular, interscalene, and supraclavicular blocks. In high-income countries, more users viewed postoperative pain blocks: adductor canal, popliteal, femoral, and transverse abdominis plane blocks. Utilization of the app was constant over time with a general decline with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion The use of an in app survey and analytics can help identify gaps and opportunities for regional anesthesia techniques and practices. This is especially impactful in limited-resource areas, such as lower-income environments and can lead to targeted educational initiatives."

M1 polymerizes upon binding membranes, but triggers for conversion of M1 from a water-soluble component of the nucleus and cytosol into an oligomer at the membrane surface are unknown. While full-length M1 is required for virus viability, the N-terminal domain (M1NT) retains membrane binding and pH-dependent oligomerization.

Several high-resolution crystallographic structures of the N-terminal domain (M1NT) have been determined, all of which show the same overall architecture at neutral or low pH and with only modest structural changes. Variations in intermolecular contacts observed in crystal structures of the M1NT can provide insights into how M1 assembles at the membrane (Fig. 1A). More than half of the structures have “side-by-side,” antiparallel dimers in the asymmetric unit in which helices 6 and 8 are at the dimer interface. The side-by-side dimer interface appears to be weak in solution but has been exploited for the development of protein cages (21Lai Y.T. Hura G.L. Dyer K.N. Tang H.Y. Tainer J.A. Yeates T.O.

A similar stacked arrangement is adopted in the crystal lattice observed for the matrix protein from a distantly related orthomyxovirus, infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus (23Zhang W. Zheng W.

In full-length structures of M1 from IAV and ISA virus, the M1CT is folded into a helical bundle, and both M1NT-M1NT and M1NT-M1CT intermolecular contacts are formed. Several mechanistic aspects of M1 function are poorly understood, including the physical triggers responsible for converting M1 from a water-soluble factor in the nucleus and cytosol to an immobilized oligomer at the plasma membrane. The membrane-attached oligomerization state is difficult to study at high resolution, and isolated full-length M1 is only weakly soluble as a monomer, although significant insights have been gained from low-resolution studies of the full-length monomeric protein in solution (14Shtykova E.V.

In this study, we sought to identify the conformational triggers associated with M1 polymerization and the features that stabilize the oligomer interface. We show here that the M1NT conformation is sensitive to solution conditions including both pH and water activity. Combining our results with available structural information, we propose that conformational changes observed at one of the polymerization interfaces and at the M1NT subdomain interface prime the protein for polymerization.

We characterized an M1 N-terminal domain construct (M1NT) and found it was monomeric at concentrations of 50 μM, as determined by size-exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) (Fig. S1), consistent with previous reports for both recombinant M1 (12Arzt S.

Rep. 2017; 7: 16793Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The NMR spectra of M1NT indicated a well-folded domain, as expected from crystallographic studies, and chemical shift assignments were possible for ∼85% of the backbone amides. Most signals for residues in the loops between helices 6 and 7 and between helices 8 and 9 were missing or too weak to assign suggesting they were dynamic. Chemical shift-based analyses of the observable resonances indicated that the secondary structure correlated well with what is seen in crystal structures (Fig. 1B). The 15N relaxation rates and heteronuclear overhauser effect (NOE) of M1NT and a more stable L4Q variant (M1NT(L4Q), see below) were measured to gain insights into flexibility (Fig. 1C). Decreased 15N R2 and {1H-15N} -heteronuclear NOEs relative to the helical regions indicated increased flexibility in the loops between helices 1 and 2 (residues 15–20) and helices 2 and 3 (residues 35–38) as well as the regions connecting the crossover helix 5 (residues 70–77 and 85–92). The relaxation properties of the glycines that could be assigned in the loops between helices 6 and 7 (residues 103–113) and between helices 8 and 9 (residues 132–140) confirmed that these regions were highly flexible. To gain insights into whether the addition of native C-terminal domain sequence affects the M1NT conformation, we trialed purification and solubility of several M1 N-terminal constructs having increasing amounts of native C-terminal sequence. Solubility was assessed by UV absorbance after spin concentrating and qualitatively by monitoring for visible aggregates during sample concentration. The M1NT alone (residues 1–164) could be concentrated to ∼50 μM and was stable for ∼4 days at 30 °C and pH 7.0. The M1NT was approximately fourfold more soluble at pH 5.5. Ten constructs containing increasing amounts of C-terminal sequence, from residues 1–180 to residues 1–252 (full-length), were tested for solubility (residues 1–180, 1–186, 1–194, 1–201, 1–209, 1–224, 1–232, 1–236, 1–241, and 1–252). It was observed that the solubility at pH 7.0 decreased as the length of the C terminus increased. An M1(1–224) construct had a concentration limit of ∼20 μM at pH 5.5 and exhibited an intermediate propensity to self-assemble, in agreement with previous findings (24Zhang K. Wang Z. Fan G.Z. Wang J. Gao S. Li Y. Sun L. Yin C.C. Liu W.J. Two polar residues within C-terminal domain of M1 are critical for the formation of influenza A virions.Cell Microbiol. 2015; 17: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) within the M1NT indicated that addition of C-terminal sequence to residue 224 resulted in modest chemical shift changes. Soluble, monomeric samples of constructs longer than M1(1–224) could not be prepared at sufficient concentration for NMR studies. Since the isolated N-terminal domain can self-associate in a pH-dependent manner similar to full-length ((15Zhang K. Wang Z. Liu X. Yin C. Basit Z. Xia B. Liu W. Dissection of influenza A virus M1 protein: pH-dependent oligomerization of N-terminal domain and dimerization of C-terminal domain.PLoS One. 2012; 7e37786Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and below), we sought to identify regions that were sensitive to pH. Differences in the chemical shifts of the M1NT monomer were measured from pH 3.5 to pH 7.0 (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A). Perturbed residues for the pH range 5.5–7.0 are found in subdomain interface helices 1, 4, 7, and 9, as well as in helix 2 (Fig. 2A). As expected from typical histidine pKa values, significant shifts were observed in H159 and H162. The resonance arising from H110 could not be reliably tracked in the titration, but perturbations observed over the pH range 5.5–7.0 in E114 (helix 7) and E6 (helix 1) are most likely due to titration of the H110 sidechain. Whereas chemical shift changes above pH ∼5 are expected to be due primarily to titration of histidine sidechains, those below pH ∼5 are expected to be due primarily to titration of glutamate and aspartate sidechains (25Hass M.A. Mulder F.A. Contemporary NMR studies of protein electrostatics.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2015; 44: 53-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Notable exceptions observed in M1NT were perturbations above pH 5.5 observed in E29 and D30, which are distant in structure from any histidines. The CSPs in E29 and D30 above pH 5.5 may be due to an unusually large pKa shift in one of the two closely apposed carboxyls. Perturbations at the subdomain interface suggested the possibility that pH affects the intramolecular interface between subdomain 1 (helices 1–4) and subdomain 2 (helices 6–9). The availability of several M1NT structures solved over a range of pH values provides an opportunity to test whether subdomain movements might be correlated with changes in pH. Six of the 11 M1NT coordinate files available are derived from wild-type A/Puerto Rico/1934 H1N1 (PR8) or wild-type A/Wilson-Smith/1933 H1N1 (WSN) strains, which differ in their M1NT sequences by just two conservative substitutions, and another four coordinate files are derived from WSN and contain a single G88E or G88R substitution (26Xie H. Lin Z. Mosier P.D. Desai U.R. Gao Y. The compensatory G88R change is essential in restoring the normal functions of influenza A/WSN/33 virus matrix protein 1 with a disrupted nuclear localization signal.J.

Maintaining pH-dependent conformational flexibility of M1 is critical for efficient influenza A virus replication.Emerg. Microbes Infect. 2017; 6: e108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, in total there are 19 unique M1NT structures largely derived from WSN or PR8. Plotting the subdomain rotation between helices 1 and 4 and helices 6 and 9 relative to that of 1EA3 indicated a modest correlation with pH (R = 0.68). However, significantly greater variation in subdomain rotation was observed for structures without stacked dimers in the crystal lattice, and a strong correlation was detected for structures containing a stacked dimer arrangement (R = 0.81; 13 structures) (Fig. 2D). The stacked dimer is formed from two interfaces, and in subdomain 1 the interface is centered on I51, which is in a hydrophobic loop and protrudes into a shallow concave surface near T67 on the adjacent subunit. Thus, the structures can be further sorted according to whether the subdomain rotation correlates with packing at the I51 interface or the T67 interface. Stacked dimer formation at the I51 surface results in a very high correlation with pH (R = 0.96; eight structures) and may indicate that this interface is most sensitive to changes in electrostatics. Early structural studies of the M1NT described a large tilt between crystalline stacked dimer subunits at low pH (22Harris A. Forouhar F. Qiu S. Sha B. Luo M. The crystal structure of the influenza matrix protein M1 at neutral pH: M1-M1 protein interfaces can rotate in the oligomeric structures of M1.Virology. 2001; 289: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2B). Seven stacked dimer arrangements of M1NT derived from either PR8 or WSN at six different pH values can now be quantified (Fig. 2E). The stacked dimer tilt angle was quantified by the subdomain 1 distances between I51 and T67. Plotting of the I51-T67 intermolecular distances against pH indicates a remarkably strong correlation (R = 0.98) (Fig. 2E) and confirms the earlier hypothesis (22Harris A. Forouhar F. Qiu S. Sha B. Luo M. The crystal structure of the influenza matrix protein M1 at neutral pH: M1-M1 protein interfaces can rotate in the oligomeric structures of M1.Virology. 2001; 289: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), at least for crystalline M1NT in the stacked dimer arrangement. The tilted stacked dimer arrangements seen at lower pH may be related to the disrupted forms of oligomeric M1 after exposure to low pH (11Calder L.J. Wasilewski S. Berriman J.A. Rosenthal P.B.

Biol. 1997; 4: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The observation of CSPs at the subdomain interface in monomeric M1NT suggests that pH-dependent subdomain movements in the monomer might correlate with the geometry of the stacked dimer. Other factors however such as close approach of H159 and H162 at the end of helix 9 to H110 of an adjacent subunit are likely also important in regulating intermolecular domain tilt. Since association with membranes induces M1 oligomerization (17Hilsch M. Goldenbogen B. Sieben C. Hofer C.T. Rabe J.P. Klipp E. Herrmann A. Chiantia S. Influenza A matrix protein M1 multimerizes upon binding to lipid membranes.Biophys. J. 2014; 107: 912-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of several membrane mimicking detergents on M1NT structure. M1NT was found to interact strongly with the single-chain detergents n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) and Anzergent 3-14 (AZ314) (Fig. S3). Whereas addition of these detergents, even at low micromolar concentrations in the case of AZ314, resulted in severe narrowing of the signals and visible aggregates in the sample within minutes, M1NT was completely unperturbed by the addition of lauryl maltose-neopentyl glycol (LMNG). In contrast, the addition of the sterol-containing surfactant CHAPS induced highly specific CSPs and the protein remained stably solubilized (Fig. 3A). The backbone amides strongly perturbed by CHAPS included residues L4, G34, T67, and E141, which are part of a solvent-exposed N-terminal surface of M1NT formed by the N terminus and helical loops (Fig. 3, B and C) and are at one of the stacked dimer oligomerization interfaces (12Arzt S.

We then tested the effect of CHAPS on M1(1–224). The strongly perturbed and well-resolved resonance of T67 was used to quantify changes in the N-terminal surface patch in response to solution additives. The M1(1–224) construct exhibited a greater CSP upon addition of CHAPS than M1NT (Fig. 4A). In contrast, lowering the pH to 5.5, at which M1 does not efficiently oligomerize, decreased the CSP observed in T67. Thus, the sterol-induced perturbations of the T67 surface patch correlated with the propensity of M1NT to self-associate. A stacked dimer arrangement is seen in several structures of the M1NT, with the neutral pH 1EA3 and 5V8A structures having the closest subdomain 1 intermolecular packing (Fig. 2E). The 1EA3 stacked dimer is associated with a uniquely extended conformation of the T67 backbone (ϕ=−80°, ψ = 165°) compared with all other crystallographic structures (ϕ = −93 ± 17°, ψ = −22 ± 21°), including 5V8a, in which the h4/h5 loop is not fully resolved (Fig. 4C). To test whether the CSPs observed upon addition of sterol-containing compounds are associated with a similar shift in the T67 backbone ψ angle, we measured 13C′ a"

In this exploratory study, we examine the composition of self-organized project groups and the structure of collaboration networks at the Santa Fe Institute’s Complex Systems Summer School. Using data from all iterations of the summer school from 2005 to 2019, comprising 823 participants and 322 projects, we investigate the factors that contribute to group composition. We first test for homophily with respect to individual-level attributes, finding that group composition is largely consistent with random mixing based on gender, career position, institutional prestige, and country of study. However, we find some evidence of homophilic preference in group composition based on disciplinary background. We then conduct analyses at the level of group projects, finding that project topics from the Social and Behavioral Sciences are over-represented. This could be due to a higher level of baseline interest in, or knowledge of, social and behavioral sciences, or the common application of methods from the natural sciences to problems in the social sciences. Consequently, future research should explore this discrepancy further and examine whether it can be mitigated through policies aimed at making topics in other disciplines more accessible or appealing for collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W3128148321,"Microscopy imaging experiments generate vast amounts of data, and there is a high demand for smart acquisition and analysis methods. This is especially true for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) where terabytes of data are produced if imaging a full sample at high resolution, and analysis can take several hours. One way to tackle this issue is to collect a continuous stream of low resolution images whilst moving the sample under the microscope, and thereafter use this data to find the parts of the sample deemed most valuable for high-resolution imaging. However, such image streams are degraded by both motion blur and noise. Building on deep learning based approaches developed for deblurring videos of natural scenes we explore the opportunities and limitations of deblurring and denoising images captured from a fast image stream collected by a TEM microscope. We start from existing neural network architectures and make adjustments of convolution blocks and loss functions to better fit TEM data. We present deblurring results on two real datasets of images of kidney tissue and a calibration grid. Both datasets consist of low quality images from a fast image stream captured by moving the sample under the microscope, and the corresponding high quality images of the same region, captured after stopping the movement at each position to let all motion settle. We also explore the generalizability and overfitting on real and synthetically generated data. The quality of the restored images, evaluated both quantitatively and visually, show that using deep learning for image restoration of TEM live image streams has great potential but also comes with some limitations."

https://openalex.org/W3129081053,"Small-scale fisheries are hard to assess because of the limited availability of data. Therefore, a method requiring easy-to-obtain catch-data is important for the assessment and management of small-scale fisheries. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of fishing gear selectivity on a length-based metric method proposed by Froese by estimating three indicators using catch-data from Lane Snapper ( Lutjanus synagris ) collected in Honduras. These indicators are (1) the percentage of mature individuals in the catch, (2) the percentage of fish within the range of estimated optimal lengths to be captured, and (3) the percentage of fish larger than the optimal length. These indicators determine the level of overfishing. The indicators were estimated separately for catch-data corresponding to gill nets, and each indicator was estimated with and without selectivity correction. Selectivity and mesh sizes of the fishing gear had a major impact on the estimation of indicators 1 and 2. As for indicator 3, it consistently showed a high level of exploitation. The three estimated indicators suggested that the Lane Snapper fishery in Honduras is experiencing overfishing. Overall, the method appears to be promising for the assessment of small-scale fisheries, but it should be used cautiously."

The particle size of FeOOH crystallites was approximately 100 nm, and they were distributed uniformly on the surface and in the pores of FeOOH/rGO. FeOOH/rGO prepared with mildly oxidized graphite had fewer defects, higher specific surface area, and higher FeOOH content than FeOOH/rGO prepared with highly oxidized graphite. These features resulted in better electrochemical properties, such as larger specific capacitance and lower charge transfer resistance."
