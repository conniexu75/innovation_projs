https://openalex.org/W2091445951,"Two crystal spectrometers aboard the orbiting solar observatory OSO-4 cover the wavelength ranges 0.5 to 3.9 angstroms and 1.0 to 8.5 angstroms. Within this range, there appear emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like states of calcium, sulfur, silicon, magnesium, and aluminum. The Mg XII Lyman-alpha is present strongly in all x-ray flares. The most intense flares (such as class 3) produce strong Si XIV Lyman-alpha and often S XVI Lyman-alpha. Emission, in the form of Ka lines of highly ionized states of calcium, iron, aluminum, and silicon is usually present. The continuum from 1 to 10 angstroms always dominates the line emission by more than an order of magnitude. Electron temperatures derived from the slope of the continuum spectrum are in the range of 10(7) to 10(8) degrees K, considerably higher than theoretical ionization equilibrium temperatures."

Elapsed time measurements of shock motion give directly determined velocities in the range 1 to 10 kilometers per second and establish the existence of two regions, one of large amplitude magnetic ""shock"" oscillations and another of smaller, sunward, upstream oscillations. Each region is as thick as 1 earth radius, or more."

https://openalex.org/W2008054413,"Solutions of potassium chloride (pH-buffered and 1-molal) equilibrated at 350 degrees C with pyrrhotite, pyrite, and magnetite contained approximately 1 millimole of reduced sulfur and less than 0.1 millimole of oxidized sulfur per kilogram. Similar solutions equilibrated with pyrite, magnetite, and hematite contained approximately 1 millimole of reduced sulfur, but 3 to 6 millimoles of oxidized sulfur per kilogram. Both types of solutions contained less than 0.1 millimole of iron per kilogram at pH >/= 6 and approximately 100 millimoles per kilogram at pH 2."
https://openalex.org/W2051297791,"Radar observations of Icarus were made in mid-June 1968, at the time of closest approach. From the data, it is estimated that the radius is between 0.3 and 0.6 kilometer and the rotation period between 1.5 and 3.3 hours. A set of round-trip Doppler shift measurements is given."

https://openalex.org/W2007923393,Observations of the pulse arrival times from the pulsar CP 0950 were made during August when the line of sight to the pulsar approached within 5 degrees of the sun in order to test a suggested mass-on-frequency effect. The observations do not show evidence for the predicted effect.

https://openalex.org/W1985276059,The magnitude of the axial pressure gradient at 77 degrees K (11 percent per centimeter) in solid methane compressed along one axis for applied pressures up to 10 kilobars was determined by comparing the electrical resistance of a pair of doped tellurium pressure gages with that of a set of single-crystal gages made of high-purity bismuth. The existence of the pressure gradient revealed the causes of deformation in metal tensile specimens embedded in solid methane and cycled to high pressure.
