Response was greater to racemic sulcatol than to a mixture (65 : 35) of S-(+) and R-(-) enantiomers, the naturally occurring isomeric ratio. Enantiomer-specific active sites on receptor proteins in the same or different cells are implicated."

https://openalex.org/W2066154796,"THE discovery that the pineal gland contained melatonin1 provided the stimulus for a multidisciplinary approach to the study of this organ. Considerable evidence suggests that this gland affects reproductive physiology. For example, it contains biologically active polypeptides. One of the first of these to be identified was arginine vasotocin (AVT), initially isolated from extracts of bovine pineal gland2, and later identified chemically and found to have antigonadotropic properties3,4. There is physiological and radioimmunoassay evidence for the origin of AVT in the pineal gland. We now present immunocytochemical evidence for the presence of this polypeptide in the pineal gland."

https://openalex.org/W1513325182,"The finding that animal synthetases are complexes consisting of two polypeptide chains (Stoops, J.K., Arslanian, M.J., Oh, Y.H., Vanaman, T.C., and Wakil, S.J. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 72, 1940-1944) led us to investigate their 4'-phosphopantetheine content. We have found that the chicken and rat synthetases contain 1.6 to 2.2 mol of 4'-phosphopantetheine per mol of the complex. The implications of this finding concerning the structure of the complex and the biosynthetic pathway of fatty acid synthesis are discussed."
