https://openalex.org/W2048168580,"Insular cortex (IC) contributes to a variety of complex brain functions, such as communication, social behavior, and self-awareness through the integration of sensory, emotional, and cognitive content. How the IC acquires its integrative properties remains unexplored. We compared the emergence of multisensory integration (MSI) in the IC of behaviorally distinct mouse strains. While adult C57BL/6 mice exhibited robust MSI, this capacity was impaired in the inbred BTBR T+tf/J mouse model of idiopathic autism. The deficit reflected weakened γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) circuits and compromised postnatal pruning of cross-modal input. Transient pharmacological enhancement by diazepam in BTBR mice during an early sensitive period rescued inhibition and integration in the adult IC. Moreover, impaired MSI was common across three other monogenic models (GAD65, Shank3, and Mecp2 knockout mice) displaying behavioral phenotypes and parvalbumin-circuit abnormalities. Our findings offer developmental insight into a key neural circuit relevant to neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia and autism."
https://openalex.org/W2047207774,"The imprinted, developmentally regulated H19 long noncoding RNA has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse human cancers, but the underlying mechanisms have remained poorly understood. Here, we report that H19 promotes tumor cell migration and invasion by inhibiting let-7, a potent tumor suppressor microRNA that functions to posttranscriptionally suppress the expression of oncogenes that regulate cell growth and motility. We show that H19 depletion impairs, whereas its overexpression enhances the motility and invasiveness of tumor cells. These phenomena occur, at least in part through affecting let-7-mediated regulation of metastasis-promoting genes, including Hmga2, c-Myc and Igf2bp3. This H19/let-7-dependent regulation is recapitulated in vivo where co-expressions of oncogenes and H19 exist in both primary human ovarian and endometrial cancers. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the anti-diabetic drug metformin inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion, partly by downregulating H19 via DNA methylation. Our results reveal a novel mechanism underpinning H19-mediated regulation in metastasis and may explain why in some cases increased let-7 expression unexpectedly correlates with poor prognosis, given the widely accepted role for let-7 as a tumor suppressor. Targeting this newly identified pathway might offer therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2095462094,"Spatial patterns of functional organization, resolved by microelectrode mapping, comprise a core principle of sensory cortices. In auditory cortex, however, recent two-photon Ca2+ imaging challenges this precept, as the traditional tonotopic arrangement appears weakly organized at the level of individual neurons. To resolve this fundamental ambiguity about the organization of auditory cortex, we developed multiscale optical Ca2+ imaging of unanesthetized GCaMP transgenic mice. Single-neuron activity monitored by two-photon imaging was precisely registered to large-scale cortical maps provided by transcranial widefield imaging. Neurons in the primary field responded well to tones; neighboring neurons were appreciably cotuned, and preferred frequencies adhered tightly to a tonotopic axis. By contrast, nearby secondary-field neurons exhibited heterogeneous tuning. The multiscale imaging approach also readily localized vocalization regions and neurons. Altogether, these findings cohere electrode and two-photon perspectives, resolve new features of auditory cortex, and offer a promising approach generalizable to any cortical area."
https://openalex.org/W2115853389,"To explore the link between bioenergetics and motor neuron degeneration, we used a computational model in which detailed morphology and ion conductance are paired with intracellular ATP production and consumption. We found that reduced ATP availability increases the metabolic cost of a single action potential and disrupts K+/Na+ homeostasis, resulting in a chronic depolarization. The magnitude of the ATP shortage at which this ionic instability occurs depends on the morphology and intrinsic conductance characteristic of the neuron. If ATP shortage is confined to the distal part of the axon, the ensuing local ionic instability eventually spreads to the whole neuron and involves fasciculation-like spiking events. A shortage of ATP also causes a rise in intracellular calcium. Our modeling work supports the notion that mitochondrial dysfunction can account for salient features of the paralytic disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including motor neuron hyperexcitability, fasciculation, and differential vulnerability of motor neuron subpopulations."

Elicitors like cadmium chloride, aluminium chloride and chitosan, precursors such as cholesterol, mevalonic acid and squalene were examined. Maximum total withanolides detected [withanolide A (7606.75 mg), withanolide B (4826.05 mg), withaferin A (3732.81 mg), withanone (6538.65 mg), 12 deoxy withanstramonolide (3176.63 mg), withanoside IV (2623.21 mg) and withanoside V (2861.18 mg)] were achieved in the combined treatment of chitosan (100 mg/l) and squalene (6 mM) along with 1 mg/l picloram, 0.5 mg/l KN, 200 mg/l L-glutamine and 5% sucrose in culture at 4 h and 48 h exposure times respectively on 28th day of culture in bioreactor. We obtained higher concentrations of total withanolides in shake-flask culture (2.13-fold) as well as bioreactor (1.66-fold) when compared to control treatments. This optimized protocol can be utilized for commercial level production of withanolides from suspension culture using industrial bioreactors in a short culture period."
https://openalex.org/W2006989513,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause for cognitive and communication problems, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms are not well understood. Epigenetic modifications, such as microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation, may underlie altered gene expression in the brain, especially hippocampus that plays a major role in spatial learning and memory and is vulnerable to TBI. To advance our understanding of miRNA in pathophysiological processes of TBI, we carried out a time-course microarray analysis of microRNA expression profile in rat ipsilateral hippocampus and examined histological changes, apoptosis and synapse ultrastructure of hippocampus post moderate TBI. We found that 10 out of 156 reliably detected miRNAs were significantly and consistently altered from one hour to seven days after injury. Bioinformatic and gene ontology analyses revealed 107 putative target genes, as well as several biological processes that might be initiated by those dysregulated miRNAs. Among those differentially expressed microRNAs, miR-144, miR-153 and miR-340-5p were confirmed to be elevated at all five time points after TBI by quantitative RT-PCR. Western blots showed three of the predicated target proteins, calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and alpha-synuclein (SNCA), were concurrently down- regulated, suggesting that miR-144, miR-153 and miR-340-5p may play important roles collaboratively in the pathogenesis of TBI-induced cognitive and memory impairments. These microRNAs might serve as potential targets for progress assessment and intervention against TBI to mitigate secondary damage to the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2009783594,"Background Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be involved in the development and progression of lung cancer. However, the roles of lncRNAs in lung cancer are not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a high-throughput microarray to compare the lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles in lung adenocarcinoma and normal tissue (NT) samples. Several candidate adenocarcinoma-associated lncRNAs were verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Using abundant and varied probes, we were able to assess 30,586 lncRNAs and 26,109 mRNAs in our microarray. We found that 2,420 lncRNAs and 1,109 mRNAs were differentially expressed (≥2-fold change) in lung adenocarcinoma samples and NT, indicating that many lncRNAs were significantly upregulated or downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma. We also found, via quantitative PCR, that 19 lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma compared with matched histologically normal lung tissues. Among these, LOC100132354 and RPLP0P2 were the most aberrantly expressed lncRNAs, as estimated by quantitative PCR in 100 pairs of lung adenocarcinoma and NT samples. Conclusions/Significance Our study ascertained the expression patterns of lncRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma by microarray. The results revealed that many lncRNAs were differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and NT, suggesting that they may play a key role in tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2331032789,"The microenvironment of glioblastoma (GBM) contains high levels of inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6), which contributes to promote tumour progression and invasion. The common epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) mutation in GBM is associated with significantly higher levels of IL-6. Furthermore, elevated IL-1β levels in GBM tumours are also believed to activate GBM cells and enhance IL-6 production. However, the crosstalk between these intrinsic and extrinsic factors within the oncogene-microenvironment of GBM causing overproduction of IL-6 is poorly understood. Here, we show that EGFRvIII potentiates IL-1β-induced IL-6 secretion from GBM cells. Importantly, exacerbation of IL-6 production is most effectively attenuated in EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells with inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2). Enhanced IL-6 production and increased sensitivity toward pharmacological p38 MAPK and MK2 inhibitors in EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells is associated with increased MK2-dependent nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling and accumulation of human antigen R (HuR), an IL-6 mRNA-stabilising protein, in the cytosol. IL-1β-stimulated activation of the p38 MAPK–MK2-HuR pathway significantly enhances IL-6 mRNA stability in GBM cells carrying EGFRvIII. Further supporting a role for the p38 MAPK–MK2-HuR pathway in the development of inflammatory environment in GBM, activated MK2 is found in more than 50% of investigated GBM tissues and correlates with lower grade and secondary GBMs. Taken together, p38 MAPK–MK2-HuR signalling may enhance the potential of intrinsic (EGFRvIII) and extrinsic (IL-1β) factors to develop an inflammatory GBM environment. Hence, further improvement of brain-permeable and anti-inflammatory inhibitors targeting p38 MAPK, MK2 and HuR may combat progression of lower grade gliomas into aggressive GBMs."
https://openalex.org/W2041562104,"The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a widely used screening tool for postpartum depression (PPD). Although the reliability and validity of EPDS in Japanese has been confirmed and the prevalence of PPD is found to be about the same as Western countries, the factor structure of the Japanese version of EPDS has not been elucidated yet.690 Japanese mothers completed all items of the EPDS at 1 month postpartum. We divided them randomly into two sample sets. The first sample set (n = 345) was used for exploratory factor analysis, and the second sample set was used (n = 345) for confirmatory factor analysis.The result of exploratory factor analysis indicated a three-factor model consisting of anxiety, depression and anhedonia. The results of confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the anxiety and anhedonia factors existed for EPDS in a sample of Japanese women at 1 month postpartum. The depression factor varies by the models of acceptable fit.We examined EPDS scores. As a result, ""anxiety"" and ""anhedonia"" exist for EPDS among postpartum women in Japan as already reported in Western countries. Cross-cultural research is needed for future research."

The mammalian cortex consists of an extraordinary number of neurons organized into a six-layered laminar structure, and is essential for all higher-order brain functions. The development of the cortex begins with the proliferation of neuroepithelial cells that gives rise to radial glial progenitors (RGPs) in the ventricular zone (VZ). The extensive division of RGPs is responsible for producing nearly all cortical excitatory neurons either directly or indirectly through transit amplifying progenitors, such as intermediate progenitors (IPs; also called basal progenitors) and short neural precursors (Anthony et al., 2004Anthony T.E.

Newborn neurons then migrate radially along the radial glial fibers of RGPs to constitute the future cortex (Hatten, 1990Hatten M.E.

Effective migration of neurons over long distances from their birthplace is essential for the proper formation and function of the cortex, and defects in this migration process have been associated with various brain disorders, such as lissencephaly, epilepsy, mental retardation, and schizophrenia (Ayala et al., 2007Ayala R.

Previous studies suggest that centrosomal integrity and function is crucial for mammalian brain development (Higginbotham and Gleeson, 2007Higginbotham H.R. Gleeson J.G. The centrosome in neuronal development.Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Kuijpers and Hoogenraad, 2011Kuijpers M. Hoogenraad C.C. Centrosomes, microtubules and neuronal development.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2011; 48: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As the major microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in animal cells, the centrosome influences most if not all microtubule (MT)-dependent processes, including cell shape, polarity and motility, as well as mitotic spindle formation and cell division (Bettencourt-Dias and Glover, 2007Bettencourt-Dias M.

Microtubule-organizing centres: a re-evaluation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It also serves as the basal body for ciliogenesis. In the developing cortex, both progenitor cell division and neuronal migration appear to be dependent on the centrosome. An increasing number of centrosomal proteins have been genetically linked to microcephaly largely resulting from defects in cortical neurogenesis, underscoring the importance of the centrosome in progenitor cell division (Higginbotham and Gleeson, 2007Higginbotham H.R. Gleeson J.G. The centrosome in neuronal development.Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Nigg and Raff, 2009Nigg E.A. Raff J.W. Centrioles, centrosomes, and cilia in health and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 663-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The centrosome has also been shown to lead the way during glial-guided neuronal migration (Tsai and Gleeson, 2005Tsai L.H. Gleeson J.G. Nucleokinesis in neuronal migration.Neuron. 2005; 46: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), the predominant mode of neuronal migration in the developing cortex (Rakic, 1972Rakic P. Mode of cell migration to the superficial layers of fetal monkey neocortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 1972; 145: 61-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). In most radially migrating cortical neurons, the centrosome is localized ahead of the nucleus, facing the leading process (Cooper, 2013Cooper J.A. Cell biology in neuroscience: mechanisms of cell migration in the nervous system.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Tsai and Gleeson, 2005Tsai L.H. Gleeson J.G. Nucleokinesis in neuronal migration.Neuron. 2005; 46: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Live imaging analysis showed that during saltatory nucleokinesis of migrating neurons, the centrosome first moves into the leading process, followed by forward displacement of the nucleus, suggesting a coordinated “two-stroke” movement of the centrosome and the nucleus during neuronal locomotion (Edmondson and Hatten, 1987Edmondson J.C.

Bremner K.H. Vallee R.B. Dual subcellular roles for LIS1 and dynein in radial neuronal migration in live brain tissue.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This coordination between the centrosome and the nucleus depends on the MT network that couples these two organelles, including the perinuclear cage that surrounds the nucleus (Rivas and Hatten, 1995Rivas R.J. Hatten M.E. Motility and cytoskeletal organization of migrating cerebellar granule neurons.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 981-989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tsai and Gleeson, 2005Tsai L.H. Gleeson J.G. Nucleokinesis in neuronal migration.Neuron. 2005; 46: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, how this MT-based coupling is regulated in radially migrating neurons remains largely unclear. The capacity of the centrosome to organize MTs is thought to be critical for coordinated movement of the centrosome and the nucleus, and neuronal migration (Kuijpers and Hoogenraad, 2011Kuijpers M. Hoogenraad C.C. Centrosomes, microtubules and neuronal development.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2011; 48: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The centrosome is composed of two orthogonally arranged centrioles surrounded by a complex matrix of proteins known as the pericentriolar material (PCM; Bettencourt-Dias and Glover, 2007Bettencourt-Dias M. Glover D.M. Centrosome biogenesis and function: centrosomics brings new understanding.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, Bornens, 2012Bornens M.

Microtubule-organizing centres: a re-evaluation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The PCM contains essential proteins responsible for MT nucleation and anchorage, including γ-tubulin (γ-TUB) and pericentrin (PCNT; Doxsey et al., 1994Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Pericentrin, a highly conserved centrosome protein involved in microtubule organization.Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, Stearns et al., 1991Stearns T.

Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T. Nucleation of microtubule assembly by a gamma-tubulin-containing ring complex.Nature. 1995; 378: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In fact, the PCM is a dynamic structure, and the exchange and transport of PCM is regulated to support MTOC activity and function of the centrosome. For example, in mitotic cells, the amount of γ-TUB at the centrosome increases approximately 3- to 5-fold at G2/M phase and this accompanies a strong increase in MT nucleating activity essential for mitotic spindle assembly (Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999Khodjakov A. Rieder C.L. The sudden recruitment of gamma-tubulin to the centrosome at the onset of mitosis and its dynamic exchange throughout the cell cycle, do not require microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Given its critical role in facilitating cell division, the mitosis-specific PCM recruitment process has been extensively studied (Barr et al., 2004Barr F.A. Silljé H.H. Nigg E.A. Polo-like kinases and the orchestration of cell division.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the regulation of PCM in postmitotic cells for the fulfillment of centrosomal function. Centriolar satellites, the highly motile granules concentrated near the centrosome and dispersed across the cytoplasm, have been thought to be crucial for protein trafficking to the centrosome and communication between the centrosome and the surrounding cytoplasm (Kubo et al., 1999Kubo A. Sasaki H. Yuba-Kubo A. Tsukita S. Shiina N. Centriolar satellites: molecular characterization, ATP-dependent movement toward centrioles and possible involvement in ciliogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The hallmark protein involved in controlling PCM dynamics through centriolar satellites is pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1; Kubo et al., 1999Kubo A. Sasaki H. Yuba-Kubo A. Tsukita S. Shiina N. Centriolar satellites: molecular characterization, ATP-dependent movement toward centrioles and possible involvement in ciliogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is a central scaffold of centriolar satellites and removal of PCM1 results in disappearance of the satellite structures near the centrosome, reduction in protein recruitment to the centrosome, and subsequent defect in MT organization at the centrosome (Dammermann and Merdes, 2002Dammermann A. Merdes A. Assembly of centrosomal proteins and microtubule organization depends on PCM-1.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Moreover, it forms a complex with p150glued, a subunit of the dynein/dynactin motor complex, to transport cargo toward the centrosome along the MTs (Kim et al., 2004Kim J.C. Badano J.L. Sibold S. Esmail M.A. Hill J. Hoskins B.E. Leitch C.C. Venner K. Ansley S.J. Ross A.J. et al.The Bardet-Biedl protein BBS4 targets cargo to the pericentriolar region and is required for microtubule anchoring and cell cycle progression.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest an important role for PCM1 and centriolar satellites in regulating the capacity of the centrosome to organize MTs. Serologically defined colon cancer antigen 8 (SDCCAG8) has been linked recently to nephronophthisis (NPHP; Otto et al., 2010Otto E.A. Hurd T.W. Airik R. Chaki M. Zhou W. Stoetzel C. Patil S.B.

It was originally cloned as a stably localized centrosomal protein of unknown function (Kenedy et al., 2003Kenedy A.A. Cohen K.J. Loveys D.A. Kato G.J. Dang C.V.

Besides renal and retinal abnormalities, patients with SDCCAG8 mutations often exhibit mental retardation, cognitive impairment, and seizures (Otto et al., 2010Otto E.A. Hurd T.W. Airik R. Chaki M.

Syndromol. 2011; 1: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, a genome-wide association study reported SDCCAG8 to be associated with an elevated risk of schizophrenia (Hamshere et al., 2012Hamshere M.L. Walters J.T. Smith R. Richards A.L. Green E. Grozeva D. Jones I. Forty L. Jones L. Gordon-Smith K. et al.Genome-wide significant associations in schizophrenia to ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8, and extensive replication of associations reported by the Schizophrenia PGC.Mol. Psychiatry. 2012; Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These observations indicate an important role for SDCCAG8 in brain development and function. In this study, we found that SDCCAG8 is selectively upregulated in newborn cortical neurons poised for radial migration. It forms a complex with PCM1 and regulates the recruitment of PCM, including γ-TUB and PCNT, to the centrosome to effect strong MTOC activity. Perturbations of SDCCAG8 expression or function disrupt MT organization and impair coupling between the centrosome and the nucleus, and their coordinated migration. Moreover, expression of a human SDCCAG8 mutant causes neuronal migration defects. Together, these results suggest that SDCCAG8 regulates the centrosomal accumulation of PCM and neuronal migration in the developing cortex, which may underlie the neurological defects associated with human SDCCAG8 mutations. To reveal the function of SDCCAG8 in mammalian cortical development, we examined its expression and subcellular localization in the developing mouse cortex. We stained embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) mouse brain sections with antibodies against SDCCAG8 and PCNT, a well-characterized centrosomal marker. SDCCAG8 exhibited a punctate expression pattern and colocalized with PCNT (Figure 1A; Figure S1A, arrows, available online), suggesting that SDCCAG8 is localized to the centrosome in the developing cortex. We also noticed small SDCCAG8 puncta away from the centrosome (Figures 1A and S1A, arrowheads). To further characterize the subcellular distribution of SDCCAG8, we prepared acutely dissociated cortical cultures and stained them with the antibodies against SDCCAG8 and γ-TUB, another well-characterized centrosomal marker. At each centrosome labeled by γ-TUB, SDCCAG8 existed as a pair of dots (Figure 1B, arrows), suggesting that it is localized to the centrioles, as previously shown in other cell types (Kenedy et al., 2003Kenedy A.A. Cohen K.J. Loveys D.A. Kato G.J. Dang C.V. Identification and characterization of the novel centrosome-associated protein CCCAP.Gene. 2003; 303: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Otto et al., 2010Otto E.A. Hurd T.W. Airik R. Chaki M. Zhou W. Stoetzel C. Patil S.B. Levy S. Ghosh A.K. Murga-Zamalloa C.A. et al.Candidate exome capture identifies mutation of SDCCAG8 as the cause of a retinal-renal ciliopathy.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 840-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Besides the centriolar localization, SDCCAG8 was also found as small puncta surrounding the centrosome and dispersed in the cytoplasm (Figure 1B, arrowheads). We next characterized the developmental expression profile of SDCCAG8 by exploiting a gene-trap mouse line, in which the LacZ gene was inserted into the Sdccag8 gene locus. Using β-galactosidase (β-Gal) as a reporter of Sdccag8 expression, we found that during the peak phase of cortical neurogenesis and neuronal migration (E12.5–E18.5), Sdccag8 was selectively expressed at high levels around the intermediate zone (IZ; Figure 1C, arrows), where newborn neurons temporarily reside prior to their radial migration to the cortical plate (CP)—the future cortex. In comparison, the expression of Sdccag8 was low in the VZ and the subventricular zone (SVZ; Figures 1C, S1C, and S1D), where RGPs and IPs are located, respectively. These results suggest that, while SDCCAG8 is present in RGPs and IPs, its expression is selectively upregulated in postmitotic neurons right before they commence radial migration into the CP. Interestingly, while the level of centrosomal SDCCAG8 in the IZ was not significantly different from that in other regions (Figures 1A and S1A, arrows), the level of cytoplasmic SDCCAG8 as small puncta was higher in the IZ (Figures 1A and S1A, arrowheads). In acutely dissociated cortical neurons identified by the neuronal marker TUJ1, SDCCAG8 was localized to the centrioles labeled by CENTRIN2-EGFP (CETN2-EGFP; Figure 1D, arrows), as well as the cytoplasmic puncta (Figure 1D, arrowheads). Notably, Sdccag8 was also expressed in the choroid plexus (Figure 1C, asterisk). The preferential upregulation of SDCCAG8 in newborn neurons in the IZ suggests that it may play a functional role. To address this, we developed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against Sdccag8 to suppress its expression. Of four Sdccag8 shRNAs (1–4), three (1, 3, and 4) showed effective suppression of SDCCAG8 expression in COS7 cells (Figures S2A) and in the developing cortex (Figure S2B). We then introduced these Sdccag8 shRNAs together with enhanced green fluorescent protein in a bicistronic plasmid, i.e., EGFP/Sdccag8 shRNA, into the developing mouse cortex at E13.5 using in utero electroporation to examine their effect on cortical development. When examined at E15.5, we found that in cortices expressing the empty plasmid with no shRNA, many transfected EGFP-expressing cells were found in the CP (Figure 2A left, arrow). In contrast, in cortices expressing Sdccag8 shRNA-1, -3, or -4, but not -2, EGFP-expressing cells were rarely found in the CP (Figure 2A right, arrows). We quantified the fraction of EGFP-expressing cells in different regions of the developing cortex. Compared to the empty plasmid control, the fraction of EGFP-expressing cells in the CP was drastically reduced, whereas the fraction in the IZ was concomitantly increased, in cortices expressing Sdccag8 shRNA-1, -3 and -4, but not -2 (Figure 2B). There was no significant difference in the VZ or the SVZ. Consistent with this, we observed no obvious changes in the fraction of EGFP-expressing cells that expressed PAX6 (Figures S3A and S3B), an RGP marker, or TBR2 (Figures S3C and S3D), an IP marker (Englund et al., 2005Englund C. Fink A. Lau C. Pham D. Daza R.A. Bulfone A. Kowalczyk T. Hevner R.F. Pax6, Tbr2, and Tbr1 are expressed sequentially by radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, and postmitotic neurons in developing neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). In addition, there was no change in neuronal production, as revealed by the fraction of EGFP-expressing cells that expressed TUJ1, an immature neuronal marker (Figures S3E and S3F). Together, these results suggest that depletion of SDCCAG8 does not obviously affect progenitors or the production of neurons, but changes the distribution of neurons in the IZ and the CP. This selective effect on postmitotic neurons likely reflects the preferential upregulation of Sdccag8 expression in nascent neurons, which renders them sensitive to Sdccag8 shRNAs. Two additional lines of evidence confirmed the specificity of Sdccag8 shRNAs. First, the effects of Sdccag8 shRNAs were tightly correlated with their efficacy in suppressing SDCCAG8 expression. Sdccag8 shRNA-1, -3, and -4 strongly suppressed SDCCAG8 expression and caused an obvious phenotype, whereas Sdccag8 shRNA-2 failed to suppress SDCCAG8 expression and did not cause any phenotype (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B). In the following experiments, we used shRNA-1 or -3 to suppress SDCCAG8 expression and shRNA-2 as a control. Second, the defective neuronal distribution in the CP was partially rescued by coexpression of the shRNA-resistant human SDCCAG8 (hSDCCAG8; Figures 2A, 2B, and S2C). Besides the distribution change, we noticed that SDCCAG8 depletion affected the morphology of neurons in the CP and the IZ. Compared to the control, the fraction of neurons with a bipolar morphology was greatly reduced in cortices expressing effective Sdccag8 shRNAs (Figures 2A and 2C). The morphologic switch from multipolar to bipolar has been thought to reflect neuronal polarization (Barnes and Polleux, 2009Barnes A.P. Polleux F. Establishment of axon-dendrite polarity in developing neurons.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 347-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and is likely critical for neuronal migration (LoTurco and Bai, 2006LoTurco J.J. Bai J. The multipolar stage and disruptions in neuronal migration.Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 407-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Notably, the defect in this morphological switch was partly overcome by E18.5, because many neurons in the CP and the IZ became bipolar (Figures S4A and S4C). Related to this, there was no obvious deficit in axon specification of dissociated cortical neurons in culture expressing Sdccag8 shRNA (Figures S4D and S4E). However, the distribution of neurons in E18.5 cortices remained severely disrupted (Figures S4A, S4B, S4F, and S4H), whereas the laminar fate specification of neurons were not affected, as revealed by the expression of CUX1 and CTIP2, two well-characterized neuronal markers for the superficial and deep layer neurons, respectively (Greig et al., 2013Greig L.C. Woodworth M.B. Galazo M.J. Padmanabhan H. Macklis J.D. Molecular logic of neocortical projection neuron specification, development and diversity.Nat. Rev.

Understanding the mechanisms driving the subtypes may be key in development of novel therapeutics but is challenged by lineage-specific expression signals. Using a t-test statistics approach, we compared gene expression subtypes across 12 tumor types, which identified eight transcriptional superclusters characterized by commonly activated disease pathways and similarities in gene expression. One of the largest superclusters was determined by the upregulation of a proliferation signature, significant enrichment in TP53 mutations, genomic loss of CDKN2A (p16ARF), evidence of increased numbers of DNA double strand breaks and high expression of cyclin B1 protein. These correlations suggested that abrogation of the P53-mediated apoptosis response to DNA damage results in activation of cell cycle pathways and represents a common theme in cancer. A second consistent pattern, observed in 9 of 11 solid tumor types, was a subtype related to an activated tumor-associated stroma. The similarity in transcriptional footprints across cancers suggested that tumor subtypes are commonly unified by a limited number of molecular themes."
https://openalex.org/W2059622139,"Neprilysin is a transmembrane zinc metallopeptidase that degrades a wide range of peptide substrates. It has received attention as a potential therapy for Alzheimer’s disease due to its ability to degrade the peptide amyloid beta. However, its broad range of peptide substrates has the potential to limit its therapeutic use due to degradation of additional peptides substrates that tightly regulate many physiological processes. We sought to generate a soluble version of the ectodomain of neprilysin with improved activity and specificity towards amyloid beta as a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer’s disease. Extensive amino acid substitutions were performed at positions surrounding the active site and inner surface of the enzyme and variants screened for activity on amyloid beta 1–40, 1–42 and a variety of other physiologically relevant peptides. We identified several mutations that modulated and improved both enzyme selectivity and intrinsic activity. Neprilysin variant G399V/G714K displayed an approximately 20-fold improved activity on amyloid beta 1–40 and up to a 3,200-fold reduction in activity on other peptides. Along with the altered peptide substrate specificity, the mutant enzyme produced a markedly altered series of amyloid beta cleavage products compared to the wild-type enzyme. Crystallisation of the mutant enzyme revealed that the amino acid substitutions result in alteration of the shape and size of the pocket containing the active site compared to the wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzyme offers the potential for the more efficient degradation of amyloid beta in vivo as a therapeutic for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2062755839,"Patient data suggest that colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) and its receptor (CSF1R) have critical roles during breast cancer progression. We have previously shown that in human breast tumors expressing both CSF1 and CSF1R, invasion in vivo is dependent both on a paracrine interaction with tumor-associated macrophages and an autocrine regulation of CSF1R in the tumor cells themselves. Although the role of the paracrine interaction between tumor cells and macrophages has been extensively studied, very little is known about the mechanism by which the autocrine CSF1R signaling contributes to tumor progression. We show here that breast cancer patients of the claudin-low subtype have significantly increased expression of CSF1R. Using a panel of breast cancer cell lines, we confirm that CSF1R expression is elevated and regulated by TGFβ specifically in claudin-low cell lines. Abrogation of autocrine CSF1R signaling in MDA-MB-231 xenografts (a claudin-low cell line) leads to increased tumor size by enhanced proliferation, but significantly reduced invasion, dissemination and metastasis. Indeed, we show that proliferation and invasion are oppositely regulated by CSF1R downstream of TGFβ only in claudin-low cell lines. Intravital multiphoton imaging revealed that inhibition of CSF1R in the tumor cells leads to decreased in vivo motility and a more cohesive morphology. We show that, both in vitro and in vivo, CSF1R inhibition results in a reversal of claudin-low marker expression by significant upregulation of luminal keratins and tight-junction proteins such as claudins. Finally, we show that artificial overexpression of claudins in MDA-MB-231 cells is sufficient to tip the cells from an invasive state to a proliferative state. Our results suggest that autocrine CSF1R signaling is essential in maintaining low claudin expression and that it mediates a switch between the proliferative and the invasive state in claudin-low tumor cells downstream of TGFβ."
https://openalex.org/W2087143527,"It is well-established that bacterial and viral infections have an exacerbating effect on allergic asthma, particularly aggravating respiratory symptoms, such as airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). The mechanism by which these infections alter AHR is unclear, but some studies suggest that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a role. In this study, we investigated the impact of TLR3 and TLR4 ligands on AHR and airway inflammation in a model of pre-established allergic inflammation. Female BALB/c mice were sensitised and challenged intranasally (i.n.) with either PBS or ovalbumin (OVA) and subsequently i.n. challenged with poly (I:C) (TLR3) or LPS (TLR4) for four consecutive days. The response to methacholine was measured in vivo; cellular and inflammatory mediators were measured in blood, lung tissue and broncheoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). OVA challenge resulted in an increase in AHR to methacholine, as well as increased airway eosinophilia and TH2 cytokine production. Subsequent challenge with TLR agonists resulted in a significant increase in AHR, but decreased TLR-specific cellular inflammation and production of immune mediators. Particularly evident was a decline in LPS-induced neutrophilia and neutrophil-associated cytokines following LPS and poly (I:C) treatment. The present data indicates that TLRs may play a pivotal role in AHR in response to microbial infection in allergic lung inflammation. These data also demonstrate that aggravated AHR occurs in the absence of an exacerbation in airway inflammation and that allergic inflammation impedes a subsequent inflammatory response to TLRs. These results may parallel clinical signs of microbial asthma exacerbation, including an extended duration of illness and increased respiratory symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W1992648356,"Cancer cell invasion and metastasis are the primary causes of treatment failure and death in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We previously reported that core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase (C1GALT1) is frequently overexpressed in HCC tumors and its expression is associated with advanced tumor stage, metastasis, and poor survival. However, the underlying mechanisms of C1GALT1 in HCC malignancy remain unclear. In this study, we found that overexpression of C1GALT1 enhanced HCC cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, migration, and invasion, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of C1GALT1 suppressed these phenotypes. The promoting effect of C1GALT1 on the metastasis of HCC cells was demonstrated in a mouse xenograft model. Mechanistic investigations showed that the C1GALT1-enhanced phenotypic changes in HCC cells were significantly suppressed by anti-integrin β1 blocking antibody. Moreover, C1GALT1 was able to modify O-glycans on integrin β1 and regulate integrin β1 activity as well as its downstream signaling. These results suggest that C1GALT1 could enhance HCC invasiveness through integrin β1 and provide novel insights into the roles of O-glycosylation in HCC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2121257896,"Susceptibility to most common cancers is likely to involve interaction between multiple low risk genetic variants. Although there has been great progress in identifying such variants, their effect on phenotype and the mechanisms by which they contribute to disease remain largely unknown. We have developed a mouse melanoma model harboring two mutant oncogenes implicated in human melanoma, CDK4(R24C) and NRAS(Q61K). In these mice, tumors arise from benign precursor lesions that are a recognized strong risk factor for this neoplasm in humans. To define molecular events involved in the pathway to melanoma, we have for the first time applied the Collaborative Cross (CC) to cancer research. The CC is a powerful resource designed to expedite discovery of genes for complex traits. We characterized melanoma genesis in more than 50 CC strains and observed tremendous variation in all traits, including nevus and melanoma age of onset and multiplicity, anatomical site predilection, time for conversion of nevi to melanoma and metastases. Intriguingly, neonatal ultraviolet radiation exposure exacerbated nevus and melanoma formation in most, but not all CC strain backgrounds, suggesting that genetic variation within the CC will help explain individual sensitivity to sun exposure, the major environmental skin carcinogen. As genetic variation brings about dramatic phenotypic diversity in a single mouse model, melanoma-related endophenotype comparisons provide us with information about mechanisms of carcinogenesis, such as whether melanoma incidence is dependent upon the density of pre-existing nevus cells. Mouse models have been used to examine the functional role of gene mutations in tumorigenesis. This work represents their next phase of development to study how biological variation greatly influences lesion onset and aggressiveness even in the setting of known somatic driver mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1976192921,"Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are important limiting nutrients for plant production and consumer performance in a variety of ecosystems. As a result, the N:P stoichiometry of herbivores has received increased attention in ecology. However, the mechanisms by which herbivores maintain N:P stoichiometric homeostasis are poorly understood. Here, using a field manipulation experiment we show that the grasshopper Oedaleus asiaticus maintains strong N:P stoichiometric homeostasis regardless of whether grasshoppers were reared at low or high density. Grasshoppers maintained homeostasis by increasing P excretion when eating plants with higher P contents. However, while grasshoppers also maintained constant body N contents, we found no changes in N excretion in response to changing plant N content over the range measured. These results suggest that O. asiaticus maintains P homeostasis primarily by changing P absorption and excretion rates, but that other mechanisms may be more important for regulating N homeostasis. Our findings improve our understanding of consumer-driven P recycling and may help in understanding the factors affecting plant-herbivore interactions and ecosystem processes in grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W2090436918,"Two β-galactosidases, β-gal I and β-gal II, from Bifidobacterium breve DSM 20213, which was isolated from the intestine of an infant, were overexpressed in Escherichia coli with co-expression of the chaperones GroEL/GroES, purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and biochemically characterized. Both β-gal I and β-gal II belong to glycoside hydrolase family 2 and are homodimers with native molecular masses of 220 and 211 kDa, respectively. The optimum pH and temperature for hydrolysis of the two substrates o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (oNPG) and lactose were determined at pH 7.0 and 50°C for β-gal I, and at pH 6.5 and 55°C for β-gal II, respectively. The kcat/Km values for oNPG and lactose hydrolysis are 722 and 7.4 mM-1s-1 for β-gal I, and 543 and 25 mM-1s-1 for β-gal II. Both β-gal I and β-gal II are only moderately inhibited by their reaction products D-galactose and D-glucose. Both enzymes were found to be very well suited for the production of galacto-oligosaccharides with total GOS yields of 33% and 44% of total sugars obtained with β-gal I and β-gal II, respectively. The predominant transgalactosylation products are β-D-Galp-(1→6)-D-Glc (allolactose) and β-D-Galp-(1→3)-D-Lac, accounting together for more than 75% and 65% of the GOS formed by transgalactosylation by β-gal I and β-gal II, respectively, indicating that both enzymes have a propensity to synthesize β-(1→6) and β-(1→3)-linked GOS. The resulting GOS mixtures contained relatively high fractions of allolactose, which results from the fact that glucose is a far better acceptor for galactosyl transfer than galactose and lactose, and intramolecular transgalactosylation contributes significantly to the formation of this disaccharide."

However, recent studies demonstrate MARCO expression and function in dendritic cells, suggesting MARCO might serve to bridge innate and adaptive immunity. To gain additional insight into the role of MARCO in dendritic cell activation and function, we profiled transcriptomes of mouse splenic dendritic cells obtained from MARCO deficient mice and their wild type counterparts under resting and activating conditions. In silico analysis uncovered major alterations in gene expression in MARCO deficient dendritic cells resulting in dramatic alterations in key dendritic cell-specific pathways and functions. Specifically, changes in CD209, FCGR4 and Complement factors can have major consequences on DC-mediated innate responses. Notably, these perturbations were magnified following activation with the TLR-4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. To validate our in silico data, we challenged DC‘s with various agonists that recognize all mouse TLRs and assessed expression of a set of immune and inflammatory marker genes. This approach identified a differential contribution of MARCO to TLR activation and validated a major role for MARCO in mounting an inflammatory response. Together, our data demonstrate that MARCO differentially affects TLR-induced DC activation and suggest targeting of MARCO could lead to different outcomes that depend on the inflammatory context encountered by DC."
https://openalex.org/W2064626053,"Long-term memory (LTM) formation requires new protein synthesis and new gene expression. Based on our work in Aplysia, we hypothesized that the rRNA genes, stimulation-dependent targets of the enzyme Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), are primary effectors of the activity-dependent changes in synaptic function that maintain synaptic plasticity and memory. Using electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, pharmacology and molecular biology techniques, we show here, for the first time, that the maintenance of forskolin-induced late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in mouse hippocampal slices requires nucleolar integrity and the expression of new rRNAs. The activity-dependent upregulation of rRNA, as well as L-LTP expression, are poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PAR) dependent and accompanied by an increase in nuclear PARP-1 and Poly(ADP) ribose molecules (pADPr) after forskolin stimulation. The upregulation of PARP-1 and pADPr is regulated by Protein kinase A (PKA) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)—two kinases strongly associated with long-term plasticity and learning and memory. Selective inhibition of RNA Polymerase I (Pol I), responsible for the synthesis of precursor rRNA, results in the segmentation of nucleoli, the exclusion of PARP-1 from functional nucleolar compartments and disrupted L-LTP maintenance. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that new rRNAs (28S, 18S, and 5.8S ribosomal components)—hence, new ribosomes and nucleoli integrity—are required for the maintenance of long-term synaptic plasticity. This provides a mechanistic link between stimulation-dependent gene expression and the new protein synthesis known to be required for memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2071313583,"Anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) is commonly adopted to control medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Depending on the side of resection, the degree to which Wallerian degeneration and adaptive plasticity occur after ATL has important implications for understanding cognitive and clinical outcome. We obtained diffusion tensor imaging from 24 TLE patients (12 left) before and after surgery, and 12 matched controls at comparable time intervals. Voxel-based analyses were performed on fractional anisotropy (FA) before and after surgery. Areas with postoperative FA increase were further investigated to distinguish between genuine plasticity and processes related to the degeneration of crossing fibers. Before surgery, both patient groups showed bilateral reduced FA in numerous tracts, but left TLE patients showed more extensive effects, including language tracts in the contralateral hemisphere (superior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate). After surgery, FA decreased ipsilaterally in both ATL groups, affecting the fornix, uncinate, stria terminalis, and corpus callosum. FA increased ipsilaterally along the superior corona radiata in both left and right ATL groups, exceeding normal FA values. In these clusters, the mode of anisotropy increased as well, confirming fiber degeneration in an area with crossing fibers. In left ATL patients, pre-existing low FA values in right superior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi normalized after surgery, while MO values did not change. Preoperative verbal fluency correlated with FA values in all areas that later increased FA in left TLE patients, but postoperative verbal fluency correlated only with FA of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. Our results demonstrate that genuine reorganization occurs in non-dominant language tracts after dominant hemisphere resection, a process that may help implement the inter-hemispheric shift of language activation found in fMRI studies. The results indicate that left TLE patients, despite showing more initial white matter damage, have the potential for greater adaptive changes postoperatively than right TLE patients."
https://openalex.org/W2081921650,"The BMI1 protein contributes to stem cell pluripotency and oncogenesis via multiple functions, including its newly identified role in DNA damage response (DDR). Although evidence clearly demonstrates that BMI1 facilitates the repair of double-stranded breaks via homologous recombination (HR), it remains unclear how BMI1 regulates checkpoint activation during DDR. We report here that BMI1 has a role in G2/M checkpoint activation in response to etoposide (ETOP) treatment. Ectopic expression of BMI1 in MCF7 breast cancer and DU145 prostate cancer cells significantly reduced ETOP-induced G2/M arrest. Conversely, knockdown of BMI1 in both lines enhanced the arrest. Consistent with ETOP-induced activation of the G2/M checkpoints via the ATM pathway, overexpression and knockdown of BMI1, respectively, reduced and enhanced ETOP-induced phosphorylation of ATM at serine 1981 (ATM pS1981). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of ATM targets, including γH2AX, threonine 68 (T68) on CHK2 (CHK2 pT68) and serine 15 (S15) on p53 were decreased in overexpression and increased in knockdown BMI1 cells in response to ETOP. In line with the requirement of NBS1 in ATM activation, we were able to show that BMI1 associates with NBS1 and that this interaction altered the binding of NBS1 with ATM. BMI1 consists of a ring finger (RF), helix-turn-helix-turn-helix-turn (HT), proline/serine (PS) domain and two nuclear localization signals (NLS). Although deletion of either RF or HT did not affect the association of BMI1 with NBS1, the individual deletions of PS and one NLS (KRMK) robustly reduced the interaction. Stable expression of these BMI1 mutants decreased ETOP-induced ATM pS1981 and CHK2 pT68, but not ETOP-elicited γH2AX in MCF7 cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of BMI1 in non-transformed breast epithelial MCF10A cells also compromised ETOP-initiated ATM pS1981 and γH2AX. Taken together, we provide compelling evidence that BMI1 decreases ETOP-induced G2/M checkpoint activation via reducing NBS1-mediated ATM activation."
https://openalex.org/W2166763898,"Hippocampal sharp wave (SW)/ripple complexes are thought to contribute to memory consolidation. Previous studies suggest that behavioral rewards facilitate SW occurrence in vivo. However, little is known about the precise mechanism underlying this enhancement. Here, we examined the effect of dopaminergic neuromodulation on spontaneously occurring SWs in acute hippocampal slices. Local field potentials were recorded from the CA1 region. A brief (1 min) treatment with dopamine led to a persistent increase in the event frequency and the magnitude of SWs. This effect lasted at least for our recording period of 45 min and did not occur in the presence of a dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist. Functional multineuron calcium imaging revealed that dopamine-induced SW augmentation was associated with an enriched repertoire of the firing patterns in SW events, whereas the overall tendency of individual neurons to participate in SWs and the mean number of cells participating in a single SW were maintained. Therefore, dopaminergic activation is likely to reorganize cell assemblies during SWs."
https://openalex.org/W1975642716,"Infertility is a worldwide concern that can be treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF). Improvements in IVF and infertility treatment depend largely on better understanding of the molecular mechanisms for human preimplantation development. Several large-scale studies have been conducted to identify gene expression patterns for the first five days of human development, and many functional studies utilize mouse as a model system. We have identified genes of possible importance for this time period by analyzing human microarray data and available data from online databases. We selected 70 candidate genes for human preimplantation development and investigated their expression in the early mouse development from oocyte to the 8-cell stage. Maternally loaded genes expectedly decreased in expression during development both in human and mouse. We discovered that 25 significantly upregulated genes after fertilization in human included 13 genes whose orthologs in mouse behaved differently and mimicked the expression profile of maternally expressed genes. Our findings highlight many significant differences in gene expression patterns during mouse and human preimplantation development. We also describe four cancer-testis antigen families that are also highly expressed in human embryos: PRAME, SSX, GAGE and MAGEA."
https://openalex.org/W1993287255,"Previous studies have shown that increased levels of the adaptor protein Sequestosome 1/p62 are observed in human breast cancers and significantly correlate with HER2 overexpression. However, the role of p62 in the pathophysiology of HER2-induced mammary tumorigenesis has not yet been investigated. In this study, we report that p62 facilitates HER2-mediated cell survival in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell culture and that HER2-induced cellular transformation requires p62, as well as NRF2, which is known to become stabilized by its release from Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) via p62-KEAP1 interaction. In agreement with these results, genetic ablation of p62 delays HER2-induced mammary tumorigenesis in tumor cell allografts in nude mice, and in MMTV-Neu transgenic mice. We also report that ablation of p62 impairs AKT and β-catenin activation in association with PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) accumulation, both in vitro and in vivo. Further in vivo studies suggest that loss of p62 also impairs NF-κB and NRF2 activation. Collectively, our results provide compelling evidence that p62 contributes to HER2-induced mammary tumorigenesis through multiple signaling pathways, including the PTEN/phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT axis, WNT/β-catenin signaling, the NF-κB pathway and the NRF2-KEAP1 axis, and offer novel insights into the potential role of p62 in the regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN."
https://openalex.org/W1996739180,"What role does personality play in the pervasive gender gap in entrepreneurship across the globe? This two-study analysis focuses on self-employment in the working population and underlying gender differences in personality characteristics, thereby considering both single trait dimensions as well as a holistic, configural personality approach. Applying the five-factor model of personality, Study 1, our main study, investigates mediation models in the prediction of self-employment status utilizing self-reported personality data from large-scaled longitudinal datasets collected in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., and Australia (total N = 28,762). Study 2 analyzes (observer-rated) Big Five data collected in 51 cultures (total N = 12,156) to take a more global perspective and to explore the pancultural universality of gender differences in entrepreneurial personality characteristics. Across the four countries investigated in Study 1, none of the major five dimension of personality turned out as a consistent and robust mediator. In contrast, the holistic, configural approach yielded consistent and robust mediation results. Across the four countries, males scored higher on an entrepreneurship-prone personality profile, which in turn predicted self-employment status. These results suggest that gender differences in the intra-individual configuration of personality traits contribute to the gender gap in entrepreneurship across the globe. With the restriction of limited representativeness, the data from Study 2 suggest that the gender difference in the entrepreneurship-prone personality profile (males score higher) is widespread across many cultures, but may not exist in all. The results are discussed with an emphasis on implications for research and practice, which a particular focus on the need for more complex models that incorporate the role of personality."
https://openalex.org/W2057151483,"Ultrastructural analysis of cells can reveal valuable information about their morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been widely used to provide high-resolution images from the surface of biological samples. However, samples need to be dehydrated and coated with conductive materials for SEM imaging. Besides, immobilizing non-adherent cells during processing and analysis is challenging and requires complex fixation protocols. In this work, we developed a novel dielectrophoresis based microfluidic platform for interfacing non-adherent cells with high-resolution SEM at low vacuum mode. The system enables rapid immobilization and dehydration of samples without deposition of chemical residues over the cell surface. Moreover, it enables the on-chip chemical stimulation and fixation of immobilized cells with minimum dislodgement. These advantages were demonstrated for comparing the morphological changes of non-budding and budding yeast cells following Lyticase treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1984041567,"Scirrhous gastric cancer is frequently associated with peritoneal dissemination, and the interaction of cancer cells with peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) is crucial for the establishment of the metastasis in the peritoneum. Although cells derived from PMCs are detected within tumors of peritoneal carcinomatosis, how PMCs are incorporated into tumor architecture is not understood. The present study shows that PMCs create the invasion front of peritoneal carcinomatosis, which depends on activation of Tks5 in PMCs. In peritoneal tumor implants, PMCs represent majority of cells located at the invasive edge of the cancer tissue. Exogenously implanted PMCs and host PMCs aggressively invade into abdominal wall upon the peritoneal inoculation of cancer cells, and PMCs locate ahead of cancer cells in the direction of invasion. Tks5, a substrate of Src kinase, is predominantly expressed in the PMCs of cancer tissue, and promotes the invasion of PMCs and cancer cells. Expression and activation of Tks5 was induced in PMCs following their exposure to gastric cancer cells, and increased Tks5 expression was detected in PMCs located at the invasion front. Reduced Tks5 expression in PMCs blocked PMC invasion, which in turn prevents cancer cell invasion both in vitro and in vivo. The peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer was significantly increased by mixing cancer cells and PMCs, and was suppressed by knockdown of Tks5 in PMCs. These results suggest that cancer-activated PMCs create invasion front by guiding cancer cells. Signaling leading to Tks5 activation in PMCs may be a suitable therapeutic target for prevention of peritoneal carcinomatosis."
https://openalex.org/W1968330729,"Aims This study sought to characterize global and regional right ventricular (RV) myocardial function in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) using 2D strain imaging. Methods We compared various parameters of RV and left ventricular (LV) systolic function between 2 groups of consecutive patients with TC at initial presentation and upon follow-up. Group 1 had RV involvement and group 2 did not have RV involvement. Results At initial presentation, RV peak systolic longitudinal strain (RVPSS) and RV fractional area change (RVFAC) were significantly lower in group 1 (−13.2±8.6% vs. −21.8±5.4%, p = 0.001; 30.7±9.3% vs. 43.5±6.3%, p = 0.001) and improved significantly upon follow-up. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) did not differ significantly at initial presentation between both groups (14.8±4.1 mm vs. 17.9±3.5 mm, p = 0.050). Differences in regional systolic RV strain were only observed in the mid and apical segments. LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV global strain were significantly lower in group 1 (36±8% vs. 46±10%, p = 0.006 and −5.5±4.8% vs. −10.2±6.2%, p = 0.040) at initial presentation. None of the parameters were significantly different between the 2 groups upon follow-up. A RVPSS cut-off value of >−19.1% had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 71% to discriminate between the 2 groups. Conclusion In TC, RVFAC, RVPSS, LVEF and LV global strain differed significantly between patients with and without RV dysfunction, whereas TAPSE did not. 2 D strain imaging was feasible for the assessment of RV dysfunction in TC and could discriminate between patients with and without RV involvement in a clinically meaningful way."
https://openalex.org/W2029861523,"TWIST2 has a dual function in tumors. Its implication in the initiation and metastasis of various solid tumors is well established, and its tumor-suppressor role in murine osteosarcoma cells has been reported recently. However, the function of TWIST2 and its underlying mechanisms in human normal and malignant hematopoiesis remain unclear. In the present study, we found that TWIST2 directly regulated p21 in human hematopoietic cells and whose silence promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Hypermethylation of TWIST2 occurred to 23 out of the 75 adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and resulted in the impaired expression of both TWIST2 and p21. Conversely, TWIST2 overexpression inhibited the growth of AML cells partially through its direct activation of p21 with intact HLH (helix-loop-helix) domain. The microarray data and gene expression validation showed that TWIST2 was sufficient to activate known tumor-suppressor genes, whereas suppress known oncogenes, which further supported its inhibitory effect against AML cells. Taken together, our data have identified a novel TWIST2-p21 axis that modulates the cell cycle of both normal and leukemic cells and demonstrated that the direct regulation of p21 by TWIST2 has a role in its tumor-suppressor function in AML."
https://openalex.org/W2058909672,"Runt domain transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) is widely regarded as a tumour-suppressor gene inactivated by DNA hypermethylation of its canonical CpG (cytidine-phosphate-guanidine) island (CGI) promoter in gastric cancer (GC). Absence of RUNX3 expression from normal gastric epithelial cells (GECs), the progenitors to GC, coupled with frequent RUNX3 overexpression in GC progression, challenge this longstanding paradigm. However, epigenetic models to better describe RUNX3 deregulation in GC have not emerged. Here, we identify lineage-specific DNA methylation at an alternate, non-CGI promoter (P1) as a new mechanism of RUNX3 epigenetic control. In normal GECs, P1 was hypermethylated and repressed, whereas in immune lineages P1 was hypomethylated and widely expressed. In human GC development, we detected aberrant P1 hypomethylation signatures associated with the early inflammatory, preneoplastic and tumour stages. Aberrant P1 hypomethylation was fully recapitulated in mouse models of gastric inflammation and tumorigenesis. Cell sorting showed that P1 hypomethylation reflects altered cell-type composition of the gastric epithelium/tumour microenvironment caused by immune cell recruitment, not methylation loss. Finally, via long-term culture of gastric tumour epithelium, we revealed that de novo methylation of the RUNX3 canonical CGI promoter is a bystander effect of oncogenic immortalization and not likely causal in GC pathogenesis as previously argued. We propose a new model of RUNX3 epigenetic control in cancer, based on immune-specific, non-CGI promoter hypomethylation. This novel epigenetic signature may have utility in early detection of GC and possibly other epithelial cancers with premalignant immune involvement."

This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of RH in Taiwanese patients with hypertension, and to ascertain whether patient characteristics influence the association of RH with adverse outcomes.Patients aged ≥45 years with hypertension were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Medical records of 111,986 patients were reviewed in this study, and 16,402 (14.6%) patients were recognized as having RH (continuously concomitant use of ≥3 anti-hypertensive medications, including a diuretic, for ≥2 years). Risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, a composite of all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke [included both fatal and nonfatal events]) in patients with RH and non-RH was analyzed. A total of 11,856 patients experienced MACE in the follow-up period (average 7.1±3.0 years). There was a higher proportion of females in the RH group, they were older than the non-RH (63.1 vs. 60.5 years) patients, and had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular co-morbidities. Overall, patients with RH had higher risks of MACE (adjusted HR 1.17; 95%CI 1.09-1.26; p<0.001). Significantly elevated risks of stroke (10,211 events; adjusted HR 1.17; 95%CI 1.08-1.27; p<0.001), especially ischemic stroke (6,235 events; adjusted HR 1.34; 95%CI 1.20-1.48; p<0.001), but not all-cause mortality (4,594 events; adjusted HR 1.06; 95%CI 0.95-1.19; p = 0.312) or acute coronary syndrome (2,145 events; adjusted HR 1.17; 95%CI 0.99-1.39; p = 0.070) were noted in patients with RH compared to those with non-RH. Subgroup analysis showed that RH increased the risks of stroke in female and elderly patients. However, no significant influence was noted in young or male patients.Patients with RH were associated with higher risks of MACE and stroke, especially ischemic stroke. The risks were greater in female and elderly patients than in male or young patients."
https://openalex.org/W1997999035,"The nematode C. elegans utilizes a relatively simple neural circuit to mediate avoidance responses to noxious stimuli such as the volatile odorant octanol. This avoidance behavior is modulated by dopamine. cat-2 mutant animals that are deficient in dopamine biosynthesis have an increased response latency to octanol compared to wild type animals, and this defect can be fully restored with the application of exogenous dopamine. Because this avoidance behavior is mediated by glutamatergic signaling between sensory neurons and premotor interneurons, we investigated the genetic interactions between dopaminergic signaling and ionotropic glutamate receptors. cat-2 mutant animals lacking either the GLR-1 or GLR-2 AMPA/kainate receptors displayed an increased response latency to octanol, which could be restored via exogenous dopamine. However, whereas cat-2 mutant animals lacking the NMR-1 NMDA receptor had increased response latency to octanol they were insensitive to exogenous dopamine. Mutants that lacked both AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors were also insensitive to exogenous dopamine. Our results indicate that dopamine modulation of octanol avoidance requires NMR-1, consistent with NMR-1 as a potential downstream signaling target for dopamine."

However, infection patterns are unknown in some scenarios such as rural settlements around Atlantic Forest fragments. Additionally, controversy remains over risk factors, and most identified patterns of infection in dogs have been found in urban areas. We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiological survey to assess the prevalence of leishmaniasis in dogs through three different serological tests, and interviews with owners to assess features of dogs and households around five Atlantic Forest remnants in southeastern Brazil. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Chi-square tests to detect associations between prevalence and variables that might influence Leishmania infection, and a nearest neighbor dispersion analysis to assess clustering in the spatial distribution of seropositive dogs. Our findings showed an average prevalence of 20% (ranging from 10 to 32%) in dogs. Nearly 40% (ranging from 22 to 55%) of households had at least one seropositive dog. Some individual traits of dogs (height, sterilization, long fur, age class) were found to positively influence the prevalence, while some had negative influence (weight, body score, presence of ectoparasites). Environmental and management features (number of cats in the households, dogs with free-ranging behavior) also entered models as negative associations with seropositivity. Strong and consistent negative (protective) influences of the presence of chickens and pigs in dog seropositivity were detected. Spatial clustering of cases was detected in only one of the five study sites. The results showed that different risk factors than those found in urban areas may drive the prevalence of canine leishmaniasis in farm/forest interfaces, and that humans and wildlife risk infection in these areas. Domestic dog population limitation by gonadectomy, legal restriction of dog numbers per household and owner education are of the greatest importance for the control of visceral leishmaniasis in rural zones near forest fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2080893860,"The tyrosine kinase WEE1 controls the timing of entry into mitosis in eukaryotes and its genetic deletion leads to pre-implantation lethality in mice. Here, we show that besides the premature mitotic entry phenotype, Wee1 mutant murine cells fail to complete mitosis properly and exhibit several additional defects that contribute to the deregulation of mitosis, allowing mutant cells to progress through mitosis at the expense of genomic integrity. WEE1 interacts with the anaphase promoting complex, functioning as a negative regulator, and the deletion of Wee1 results in hyper-activation of this complex. Mammary specific knockout mice overcome the DNA damage response pathway triggered by the mis-coordination of the cell cycle in mammary epithelial cells and heterozygote mice spontaneously develop mammary tumors. Thus, WEE1 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that coordinates distinct cell division events to allow correct segregation of genetic information into daughter cells and maintain genome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2089228216,"In rodents, the infralimbic (IL) region of the medial prefrontal cortex plays a key role in the recall of fear extinction. Previously we showed that fear conditioning decreases the intrinsic excitability of IL neurons, and that fear extinction reverses the depressed excitability. In the current study, we examined the time course of the extinction-induced changes in adolescent rats. Immediately after extinction, IL neurons continued to show depressed excitability. However 4 hours after extinction, IL neurons showed an increase in evoked spikes that correlated with a reduced fast afterhyperpolarizing potential. This suggests that acquisition of fear extinction induces an increase in spike firing 4 hours later, during the consolidation of extinction. We also examined IL excitability in a group of rats that showed spontaneous recovery of fear 17 days after extinction (SR group). Similar to neurons after fear conditioning, IL neurons from the SR group showed depressed intrinsic excitability compared to neurons 4 hours after extinction, suggesting that extinction-induced enhancement in intrinsic excitability decreases with time reverting back to a depressed state. These results suggest that plasticity in IL contributes to the spontaneous recovery of fear and preventing this depression of IL excitability could prolong fear extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2082583328,"Vaccines against HPV16/18 are approved for use in females and males but most countries currently have female-only programs. Cultural and geographic factors associated with HPV vaccine uptake might also influence sexual partner choice; this might impact post-vaccination outcomes. Our aims were to examine the population-level impact of adding males to HPV vaccination programs if factors influencing vaccine uptake also influence partner choice, and additionally to quantify how this changes the post-vaccination distribution of disease between subgroups, using incident infections as the outcome measure.A dynamic model simulated vaccination of pre-adolescents in two scenarios: 1) vaccine uptake was correlated with factors which also affect sexual partner choice (""correlated""); 2) vaccine uptake was unrelated to these factors (""unrelated""). Coverage and degree of heterogeneity in uptake were informed by observed data from Australia and the USA. Population impact was examined via the effect on incident HPV16 infections. The rate ratio for post-vaccination incident HPV16 in the lowest compared to the highest coverage subgroup (RR(L)) was calculated to quantify between-group differences in outcomes.The population-level incremental impact of adding males was lower if vaccine uptake was ""correlated"", however the difference in population-level impact was extremely small (<1%) in the Australia and USA scenarios, even under the conservative and extreme assumption that subgroups according to coverage did not mix at all sexually. At the subgroup level, ""correlated"" female-only vaccination resulted in RR(L)= 1.9 (Australia) and 1.5 (USA) in females, and RR(L)= 1.5 and 1.3 in males. ""Correlated"" both-sex vaccination increased RR(L) to 4.2 and 2.1 in females and 3.9 and 2.0 in males in the Australia and USA scenarios respectively.The population-level incremental impact of male vaccination is unlikely to be substantially impacted by feasible levels of heterogeneity in uptake. However, these findings emphasize the continuing importance of prioritizing high coverage across all groups in HPV vaccination programs in terms of achieving equality of outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2086451966,"The gene ankyrin repeat domain 1 (Ankrd1) is an enigmatic gene and may exert pleiotropic function dependent on its expression level, subcellular localization and even types of pathological stress, but it remains unclear how these factors influence the fate of cardiomyocytes. Here we attempted to investigate the role of CARP on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCs), angiotensin II (Ang II) increased the expression of both calpain 1 and CARP, and also induced cytosolic translocation of CARP, which was abrogated by a calpain inhibitor. In the presence of Ang-II in NRVCs, infection with a recombinant adenovirus containing rat Ankrd1 cDNA (Ad-Ankrd1) enhanced myocyte hypertrophy, the upregulation of atrial natriuretic peptide and β-myosin heavy chain genes and calcineurin proteins as well as nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells. Cyclosporin A attenuated Ad-Ankrd1-enhanced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Intra-myocardial injection of Ad-Ankrd1 in mice with transverse aortic constriction (TAC) markedly increased the cytosolic CARP level, the heart weight/body weight ratio, while short hairpin RNA targeting Ankrd1 inhibited TAC-induced hypertrophy. The expression of calcineurin was also significantly increased in Ad-Ankrd1-infected TAC mice. Olmesartan (an Ang II receptor antagonist) prevented the upregulation of CARP in both Ang II-stimulated NRVCs and hearts with pressure overload. These findings indicate that overexpression of Ankrd1 exacerbates pathological cardiac remodeling through the enhancement of cytosolic translocation of CARP and upregulation of calcineurin."
https://openalex.org/W2056827092,"New methods are needed for large scale modeling of metabolism that predict metabolite levels and characterize the thermodynamics of individual reactions and pathways. Current approaches use either kinetic simulations, which are difficult to extend to large networks of reactions because of the need for rate constants, or flux-based methods, which have a large number of feasible solutions because they are unconstrained by the law of mass action. This report presents an alternative modeling approach based on statistical thermodynamics. The principles of this approach are demonstrated using a simple set of coupled reactions, and then the system is characterized with respect to the changes in energy, entropy, free energy, and entropy production. Finally, the physical and biochemical insights that this approach can provide for metabolism are demonstrated by application to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of Escherichia coli. The reaction and pathway thermodynamics are evaluated and predictions are made regarding changes in concentration of TCA cycle intermediates due to 10- and 100-fold changes in the ratio of NAD+:NADH concentrations. Finally, the assumptions and caveats regarding the use of statistical thermodynamics to model non-equilibrium reactions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2064570507,"Internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) are utilized by a subset of cellular and viral mRNAs to initiate translation during cellular stress and virus infection when canonical cap-dependent translation is compromised. The intergenic region (IGR) IRES of the Dicistroviridae uses a streamlined mechanism in which it can directly recruit the ribosome in the absence of initiation factors and initiates translation using a non-AUG codon. A subset of IGR IRESs including that from the honey bee viruses can also direct translation of an overlapping +1 frame gene. In this study, we systematically examined cellular conditions that lead to IGR IRES-mediated 0 and +1 frame translation in Drosophila S2 cells. Towards this, a novel bicistronic reporter that exploits the 2A “stop-go” peptide was developed to allow the detection of IRES-mediated translation in vivo. Both 0 and +1 frame translation by the IGR IRES are stimulated under a number of cellular stresses and in S2 cells infected by cricket paralysis virus, demonstrating a switch from cap-dependent to IRES-dependent translation. The regulation of the IGR IRES mechanism ensures that both 0 frame viral structural proteins and +1 frame ORFx protein are optimally expressed during virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2101928047,"Solvent-tolerant microbes have the unique ability to thrive in presence of organic solvents. The present study describes the effect of increasing hydrophobicity (log Pow values) of organic solvents on the outer membrane proteome of the solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas aeruginosa PseA cells. The cells were grown in a medium containing 33% (v/v) alkanes of increasing log Pow values. The outer membrane proteins were extracted by alkaline extraction from the late log phase cells and changes in the protein expression were studied by 2-D gel electrophoresis. Seven protein spots showed significant differential expression in the solvent exposed cells. The tryptic digest of the differentially regulated proteins were identified by LC-ESI MS/MS. The identity of these proteins matched with porins OprD, OprE, OprF, OprH, Opr86, LPS assembly protein and A-type flagellin. The reported pI values of these proteins were in the range of 4.94–8.67 and the molecular weights were in the range of 19.5–104.5 kDa. The results suggest significant down-regulation of the A-type flagellin, OprF and OprD and up-regulation of OprE, OprH, Opr86 and LPS assembly protein in presence of organic solvents. OprF and OprD are implicated in antibiotic uptake and outer membrane stability, whereas A-type flagellin confers motility and chemotaxis. Up-regulated OprE is an anaerobically-induced porin while Opr86 is responsible for transport of small molecules and assembly of the outer membrane proteins. Differential regulation of the above porins clearly indicates their role in adaptation to solvent exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2002651511,"Objective To study the in vivo and in vitro effects of adding oxygen carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to chemotherapy for breast cancer. Methods MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells were co-cultured with paclitaxel and then exposed to oxygen-CNTs under hypoxic conditions. Cell proliferation, viability, and apoptosis rate were analyzed. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression was measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot. Nude mice were used as a human breast cancer model to explore the impact of oxygen-CNTs on the in vivo chemotherapeutic effect of paclitaxel. Results Oxygen-CNTs had no significant effects on the growth of breast cancer cells under normoxia and hypoxia. However, in the hypoxic environment, oxygen-CNTs significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel on cell proliferation, as well as the apoptosis rate. Under hypoxia, downregulation of HIF-1α and upregulation of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, LC3 and Beclin-1 were observed when paclitaxel was combined with oxygen-CNT. Furthermore, addition of oxygen-CNTs to chemotherapy was found to significantly reduce tumor weight in the tumor-bearing mice model. Conclusions Oxygen-CNTs can significantly increase the chemotherapeutic effect of paclitaxel on breast cancer cells. Oxygen-CNTs may be a potential chemosensitizer in breast cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2003878660,"Manual offline analysis, of a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, is a time consuming process and requires continuous human intervention and efforts. This paper presents an image processing based method for automated offline analyses of SEM images. To this end, our strategy relies on a two-stage process, viz. texture analysis and quantification. The method involves a preprocessing step, aimed at the noise removal, in order to avoid false edges. For texture analysis, the proposed method employs a state of the art Curvelet transform followed by segmentation through a combination of entropy filtering, thresholding and mathematical morphology (MM). The quantification is carried out by the application of a box-counting algorithm, for fractal dimension (FD) calculations, with the ultimate goal of measuring the parameters, like surface area and perimeter. The perimeter is estimated indirectly by counting the boundary boxes of the filled shapes. The proposed method, when applied to a representative set of SEM images, not only showed better results in image segmentation but also exhibited a good accuracy in the calculation of surface area and perimeter. The proposed method outperforms the well-known Watershed segmentation algorithm."

Thus, simplified models of macrophage activation do not explain the extent of heterogeneity seen in vivo. We focus here on the respiratory tract and ask whether factors secreted by alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) can influence the functionality of resident pulmonary macrophages (PuM). We have previously reported that factors secreted by AEC increase control of intracellular growth of BCG in macrophages. In the current study, we also aimed to investigate possible mechanisms by which AEC-derived factors increase intracellular control of BCG in both primary murine interstitial macrophages, and bone marrow-derived macrophages and characterize further the effect of these factors on macrophage differentiation. We show that; a) in contrast to other macrophage types, IFN-γ did not increase intracellular growth control of Mycobacterium bovis, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) by interstitial pulmonary macrophages although the same macrophages could be activated by factors secreted by AEC; b) the lack of response of pulmonary macrophages to IFN-γ was apparently regulated by suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1; c) AEC-derived factors did not induce pro-inflammatory pathways induced by IFN-γ e.g. expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), secretion of nitric oxide (NO), or IL-12, d) in contrast to IFN-γ, intracellular bacterial destruction induced by AEC-derived factors was not dependent on iNOS transcription and NO production. Collectively, our data show that PuM were restricted in inflammatory responses mediated by IFN-γ through SOCS1 and that factors secreted by AEC- enhanced the microbicidal capacities of macrophages by iNOS independent mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2013408991,"Background The limited effectiveness of cardiac cell therapy has generated concern regarding its clinical relevance. Experimental studies show that cell retention and engraftment are low after injection into ischemic myocardium, which may restrict therapy effectiveness significantly. Surgical aspects and mechanical loss are suspected to be the main culprits behind this phenomenon. As current techniques of monitoring intramyocardial injections are complex and time-consuming, the aim of the study was to develop a fast and simple model to study cardiac retention and distribution following intramyocardial injections. For this purpose, our main hypothesis was that macroscopic fluorescence imaging could adequately serve as a detection method for intramyocardial injections. Methods and Results A total of 20 mice underwent ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) for myocardial infarction. Fluorescent microspheres with cellular dimensions were used as cell surrogates. Particles (5×105) were injected into the infarcted area of explanted resting hearts (Ex vivo myocardial injetions EVMI, n = 10) and in vivo into beating hearts (In vivo myocardial injections IVMI, n = 10). Microsphere quantification was performed by fluorescence imaging of explanted organs. Measurements were repeated after a reduction to homogenate dilutions. Cardiac microsphere retention was 2.78×105±0.31×105 in the EVMI group. In the IVMI group, cardiac retention of microspheres was significantly lower (0.74×105±0.18×105; p<0.05). Direct fluorescence imaging revealed venous drainage through the coronary sinus, resulting in a microsphere accumulation in the left (0.90×105±0.20×105) and the right (1.07×105±0.17×105) lung. Processing to homogenates involved further particle loss (p<0.05) in both groups. Conclusions We developed a fast and simple direct fluorescence imaging method for biodistribution analysis which enabled the quantification of fluorescent microspheres after intramyocardial delivery using macroscopic fluorescence imaging. This new technique showed massive early particle loss and venous drainage into the right atrium leading to substantial accumulation of graft particles in both lungs."

The present study explores whether walking time may provide an early signal of cognitive performance, using 266 healthy adults ([18-65] years old, mean age: 45.7±12.9 years) who were also subdivided in 2 groups: under or over 50. Walking time (50 meters) and cognitive performances (mini-mental state examination, Benton Visual Retention Test and Rey Complex Figure) were assessed; total psychometric score was the sum of individual test scores. Analyses were controlled for age, gender, education level, height and weight. The mean psychometric scores were within the normal range. A substantial proportion of subjects exhibited low performance in some aspects of visuospatial memory, particularly in the older subset. In the total population, walking time was negatively correlated with all cognitive tests, particularly to total psychometric score (R = -0.817, p<0.0001); the unique contribution of walking time on all cognitive scores was very high (delta R-squared = 0.496). In the older subset, performances on walk and cognition were lower than in the younger subset. Total psychometric score showed the strongest correlation with walking time in the older subset (R = -0.867; p<0.001). In all subsets, walking time was the main explanatory variable of the total psychometric score (delta R-squared: ≤ 49 = 0.361; ≥50 = 0.613). These findings indicate that i) a significant proportion of adults without cognitive complaints exhibit low cognitive performance including visuospatial memory and longer walking time, ii) cognitive functioning is strongly correlated to walking time in healthy middle-aged adults, iii) gait velocity (GV) could be an indicator of cognitive performance in some important cognitive domains. These results warrant further investigation because such data may represent a marker for the detection of middle-aged adults who are at risk for further cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2005844141,"The tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is inactivated in a wide variety of cancers. While its role during cell cycle is well characterized, little is known about its properties on apoptosis regulation and apoptosis-induced cell responses. pRb shorter forms that can modulate pRB apoptotic properties, resulting from cleavages at caspase specific sites are observed in several cellular contexts. A bioinformatics analysis showed that a putative caspase cleavage site (TELD) is found in the Drosophila homologue of pRb (RBF) at a position similar to the site generating the p76Rb form in mammals. Thus, we generated a punctual mutant form of RBF in which the aspartate of the TELD site is replaced by an alanine. This mutant form, RBFD253A, conserved the JNK-dependent pro-apoptotic properties of RBF but gained the ability of inducing overgrowth phenotypes in adult wings. We show that this overgrowth is a consequence of an abnormal proliferation in wing imaginal discs, which depends on the JNK pathway activation but not on wingless (wg) ectopic expression. These results show for the first time that the TELD site of RBF could be important to control the function of RBF in tissue homeostasis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1999818308,"In the current study, we assessed whether visuospatial sequence knowledge is retained over 24 hours and whether this retention is dependent on the occurrence of eye movements. Participants performed two sessions of a serial reaction time (SRT) task in which they had to manually react to the identity of a target letter pair presented in one of four locations around a fixation cross. When the letter pair ‘XO’ was presented, a left response had to be given, when the letter pair ‘OX’ was presented, a right response was required. In the Eye Movements (EM) condition, eye movements were necessary to perform the task since the fixation cross and the target were separated by at least 9° visual angle. In the No Eye Movements (NEM) condition, on the other hand, eye movements were minimized by keeping the distance from the fixation cross to the target below 1° visual angle and by limiting the stimulus presentation to 100 ms. Since the target identity changed randomly in both conditions, no manual response sequence was present in the task. However, target location was structured according to a deterministic sequence in both the EM and NEM condition. Learning of the target location sequence was determined at the end of the first session and 24 hours after initial learning. Results indicated that the sequence learning effect in the SRT task diminished, yet remained significant, over the 24 hour interval in both conditions. Importantly, the difference in eye movements had no impact on the transfer of sequence knowledge. These results suggest that the retention of visuospatial sequence knowledge occurs alike, irrespective of whether this knowledge is supported by eye movements or not."
