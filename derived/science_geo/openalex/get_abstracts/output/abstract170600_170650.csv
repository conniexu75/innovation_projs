https://openalex.org/W2014887370,"The epidemic of type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In both disorders, tissues such as muscle, fat and liver become less responsive or resistant to insulin. This state is also linked to other common health problems, such as obesity, polycystic ovarian disease, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of insulin resistance involves a complex network of signalling pathways, activated by the insulin receptor, which regulates intermediary metabolism and its organization in cells. But recent studies have shown that numerous other hormones and signalling events attenuate insulin action, and are important in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2086192317,"Oxygen isotope records of five stalagmites from Hulu Cave near Nanjing bear a remarkable resemblance to oxygen isotope records from Greenland ice cores, suggesting that East Asian Monsoon intensity changed in concert with Greenland temperature between 11,000 and 75,000 years before the present (yr. B.P.). Between 11,000 and 30,000 yr. B.P., the timing of changes in the monsoon, as established with 230Th dates, generally agrees with the timing of temperature changes from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) core, which supports GISP2's chronology in this interval. Our record links North Atlantic climate with the meridional transport of heat and moisture from the warmest part of the ocean where the summer East Asian Monsoon originates."
https://openalex.org/W2141913814,"As a discipline, phylogenetics is becoming transformed by a flood of molecular data. These data allow broad questions to be asked about the history of life, but also present difficult statistical and computational problems. Bayesian inference of phylogeny brings a new perspective to a number of outstanding issues in evolutionary biology, including the analysis of large phylogenetic trees and complex evolutionary models and the detection of the footprint of natural selection in DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2127073167,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , more than 80% of the ∼6200 predicted genes are nonessential, implying that the genome is buffered from the phenotypic consequences of genetic perturbation. To evaluate function, we developed a method for systematic construction of double mutants, termed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis, in which a query mutation is crossed to an array of ∼4700 deletion mutants. Inviable double-mutant meiotic progeny identify functional relationships between genes. SGA analysis of genes with roles in cytoskeletal organization ( BNI1 , ARP2 , ARC40 , BIM1 ), DNA synthesis and repair ( SGS1 , RAD27 ), or uncharacterized functions ( BBC1 , NBP2 ) generated a network of 291 interactions among 204 genes. Systematic application of this approach should produce a global map of gene function."
https://openalex.org/W2101671848,"Molecular phylogenetic studies have resolved placental mammals into four major groups, but have not established the full hierarchy of interordinal relationships, including the position of the root. The latter is critical for understanding the early biogeographic history of placentals. We investigated placental phylogeny using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods and a 16.4-kilobase molecular data set. Interordinal relationships are almost entirely resolved. The basal split is between Afrotheria and other placentals, at about 103 million years, and may be accounted for by the separation of South America and Africa in the Cretaceous. Crown-group Eutheria may have their most recent common ancestry in the Southern Hemisphere (Gondwana)."
https://openalex.org/W2145375372,"Electroluminescence from a single quantum dot within the intrinsic region of a p-i-n junction is shown to act as an electrically driven single-photon source. At low injection currents, the dot electroluminescence spectrum reveals a single sharp line due to exciton recombination, while another line due to the biexciton emerges at higher currents. The second-order correlation function of the diode displays anti-bunching under a continuous drive current. Single-photon emission is stimulated by subnanosecond voltage pulses. These results suggest that semiconductor technology can be used to mass-produce a single-photon source for applications in quantum information technology."
https://openalex.org/W2090681869,"Helicobacter pylori CagA protein is associated with severe gastritis and gastric carcinoma. CagA is injected from the attached Helicobacter pylori into host cells and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. Wild-type but not phosphorylation-resistant CagA induced a growth factor-like response in gastric epithelial cells. Furthermore, CagA formed a physical complex with the SRC homology 2 domain (SH2)-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and stimulated the phosphatase activity. Disruption of the CagA-SHP-2 complex abolished the CagA-dependent cellular response. Conversely, the CagA effect on cells was reproduced by constitutively active SHP-2. Thus, upon translocation, CagA perturbs cellular functions by deregulating SHP-2."

https://openalex.org/W2099982459,"Peptide recognition modules mediate many protein-protein interactions critical for the assembly of macromolecular complexes. Complete genome sequences have revealed thousands of these domains, requiring improved methods for identifying their physiologically relevant binding partners. We have developed a strategy combining computational prediction of interactions from phage-display ligand consensus sequences with large-scale two-hybrid physical interaction tests. Application to yeast SH3 domains generated a phage-display network containing 394 interactions among 206 proteins and a two-hybrid network containing 233 interactions among 145 proteins. Graph theoretic analysis identified 59 highly likely interactions common to both networks. Las17 (Bee1), a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) family of actin-assembly proteins, showed multiple SH3 interactions, many of which were confirmed in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2166418062,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen capable of transferring a defined segment of DNA to a host plant, generating a gall tumor. Replacing the transferred tumor-inducing genes with exogenous DNA allows the introduction of any desired gene into the plant. Thus, A. tumefaciens has been critical for the development of modern plant genetics and agricultural biotechnology. Here we describe the genome of A. tumefaciens strain C58, which has an unusual structure consisting of one circular and one linear chromosome. We discuss genome architecture and evolution and additional genes potentially involved in virulence and metabolic parasitism of host plants."
https://openalex.org/W2046518060,"Vaccines rarely provide full protection from disease. Nevertheless, partially effective (imperfect) vaccines may be used to protect both individuals and whole populations. We studied the potential impact of different types of imperfect vaccines on the evolution of pathogen virulence (induced host mortality) and the consequences for public health. Here we show that vaccines designed to reduce pathogen growth rate and/or toxicity diminish selection against virulent pathogens. The subsequent evolution leads to higher levels of intrinsic virulence and hence to more severe disease in unvaccinated individuals. This evolution can erode any population-wide benefits such that overall mortality rates are unaffected, or even increase, with the level of vaccination coverage. In contrast, infection-blocking vaccines induce no such effects, and can even select for lower virulence. These findings have policy implications for the development and use of vaccines that are not expected to provide full immunity, such as candidate vaccines for malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2043114724,"The embryophytes (land plants) have long been thought to be related to the green algal group Charophyta, though the nature of this relationship and the origin of the land plants have remained unresolved. A four-gene phylogenetic analysis was conducted to investigate these relationships. This analysis supports the hypothesis that the land plants are placed phylogenetically within the Charophyta, identifies the Charales (stoneworts) as the closest living relatives of plants, and shows the Coleochaetales as sister to this Charales/land plant assemblage. The results also support the unicellular flagellate Mesostigma as the earliest branch of the charophyte lineage. These findings provide insight into the nature of the ancestor of plants, and have broad implications for understanding the transition from aquatic green algae to terrestrial plants."
https://openalex.org/W2111444354,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a single point mutation in the human betaA globin gene that results in the formation of an abnormal hemoglobin [HbS (alpha2betaS2)]. We designed a betaA globin gene variant that prevents HbS polymerization and introduced it into a lentiviral vector we optimized for transfer to hematopoietic stem cells and gene expression in the adult red blood cell lineage. Long-term expression (up to 10 months) was achieved, without preselection, in all transplanted mice with erythroid-specific accumulation of the antisickling protein in up to 52% of total hemoglobin and 99% of circulating red blood cells. In two mouse SCD models, Berkeley and SAD, inhibition of red blood cell dehydration and sickling was achieved with correction of hematological parameters, splenomegaly, and prevention of the characteristic urine concentration defect."

https://openalex.org/W1969577194,"The pore-forming subunits of canonical voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels are encoded by four repeated domains of six-transmembrane (6TM) segments. We expressed and characterized a bacterial ion channel (NaChBac) from Bacillus halodurans that is encoded by one 6TM segment. The sequence, especially in the pore region, is similar to that of voltage-gated calcium channels. The expressed channel was activated by voltage and was blocked by calcium channel blockers. However, the channel was selective for sodium. The identification of NaChBac as a functionally expressed bacterial voltage-sensitive ion-selective channel provides insight into both voltage-dependent activation and divalent cation selectivity."

https://openalex.org/W1993623149,"DNA replication origins are fundamental to chromosome organization and duplication, but understanding of these elements is limited because only a small fraction of these sites have been identified in eukaryotic genomes. Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins form prereplicative complexes at origins of replication. Using these proteins as molecular landmarks for origins, we identified ORC- and MCM-bound sites throughout the yeast genome. Four hundred twenty-nine sites in the yeast genome were predicted to contain replication origins, and approximately 80% of the loci identified on chromosome X demonstrated origin function. A substantial fraction of the predicted origins are associated with repetitive DNA sequences, including subtelomeric elements (X and Y') and transposable element-associated sequences (long terminal repeats). These findings identify the global set of yeast replication origins and open avenues of investigation into the role(s) ORC and MCM proteins play in chromosomal architecture and dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2114489396,"“Real time” molecular dynamics simulations of water permeation through human aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and the bacterial glycerol facilitator GlpF are presented. We obtained time-resolved, atomic-resolution models of the permeation mechanism across these highly selective membrane channels. Both proteins act as two-stage filters: Conserved fingerprint [asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA)] motifs form a selectivity-determining region; a second (aromatic/arginine) region is proposed to function as a proton filter. Hydrophobic regions near the NPA motifs are rate-limiting water barriers. In AQP1, a fine-tuned water dipole rotation during passage is essential for water selectivity. In GlpF, a glycerol-mediated “induced fit” gating motion is proposed to generate selectivity for glycerol over water."
https://openalex.org/W2017813763,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects more than 300 million people and is a leading cause of liver cancer and disease. The HBV HBx protein is essential for infection; HBx activation of Src is important for HBV DNA replication. In our study, HBx activated cytosolic calcium-dependent proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2 (Pyk2), a Src kinase activator. HBx activation of HBV DNA replication was blocked by inhibiting Pyk2 or calcium signaling mediated by mitochondrial calcium channels, which suggests that HBx targets mitochondrial calcium regulation. Reagents that increased cytosolic calcium substituted for HBx protein in HBV DNA replication. Thus, alteration of cytosolic calcium was a fundamental requirement for HBV replication and was mediated by HBx protein."

https://openalex.org/W2111630252,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a strong angiogenic mitogen and plays important roles in angiogenesis under various pathophysiological conditions. The in vivo angiogenic activity of secreted VEGF may be regulated by extracellular inhibitors, because it is also produced in avascular tissues such as the cartilage. To seek the binding inhibitors against VEGF, we screened the chondrocyte cDNA library by a yeast two-hybrid system by using VEGF165 as bait and identified connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as a candidate. The complex formation of VEGF165 with CTGF was first established by immunoprecipitation from the cells overexpressing both binding partners. A competitive affinity-binding assay also demonstrated that CTGF binds specifically to VEGF165 with two classes of binding sites (Kd = 26 +/- 11 nM and 125 +/- 38 nM). Binding assay using deletion mutants of CTGF indicated that the thrombospondin type-1 repeat (TSP-1) domain of CTGF binds to the exon 7-coded region of VEGF165 and that the COOH-terminal domain preserves the affinity to both VEGF165 and VEGF121. The interaction of VEGF165 with CTGF inhibited the binding of VEGF165 to the endothelial cells and the immobilized KDR/IgG Fc; that is, a recombinant protein for VEGF165 receptor. By in vitro tube formation assay of endothelial cells, full-length CTGF and the deletion mutant possessing the TSP-1 domain inhibited VEGF165-induced angiogenesis significantly in the complex form. This antiangiogenic activity of CTGF was demonstrated further by in vivo angiogenesis assay by using Matrigel injection model in mice. These data demonstrate for the first time that VEGF165 binds to CTGF through a protein-to-protein interaction and suggest that the angiogenic activity of VEGF165 is regulated negatively by CTGF in the extracellular environment."

https://openalex.org/W2049254359,"The glass transition temperature ( T g ) in water is still uncertain, with conflicting values reported in the literature. As with other hyperquenched glasses, water exhibits a large relaxation exotherm on reheating at the normal rate of 10 kelvin (K) per minute. This release of heat indicates the transformation of a high enthalpy state to a lower one found in slow-cooled glasses. When the exotherm temperature is scaled by T g , the good glass-formers show a common pattern. However, for hyperquenched water, when this analysis is performed using the commonly accepted T g = 136 K, its behavior appears completely different, but this should not be the case because enthalpy relaxation is fundamental to the calorimetric glass transition. With T g = 165 ± 5 K, normal behavior is restored in comparison with other hyperquenched glasses and with the binary solution behavior of network-former systems (H 2 O, ZnCl 2 , or BeF 2 plus a second component). This revised value has relevance to the understanding of water- biomolecule interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2032125647,"We have detected a global mode of Earth deformation that is predicted by theory. Precise positioning of Global Positioning System sites distributed worldwide reveals that during February to March, the Northern Hemisphere compresses (and the Southern Hemisphere expands), such that sites near the North Pole move downward by 3.0 millimeters, and sites near the equator are pulled northward by 1.5 millimeters. The opposite pattern of deformation occurs during August to September. We identify this pattern as the degree-one spherical harmonic response of an elastic Earth to increased winter loading of soil moisture, snow cover, and atmosphere. Data inversion shows the load moment's trajectory as a great circle traversing the continents, peaking at 6.9 x 10(22) kilogram meters near the North Pole in winter, indicating interhemispheric mass exchange of 1.0 x 10(16) +/- 0.2 x 10(16) kilograms."

https://openalex.org/W2058151080,"In mammals, X-inactivation silences one of two female X chromosomes. Silencing depends on the noncoding gene, Xist (inactive X-specific transcript), and is blocked by the antisense gene, Tsix. Deleting the choice/imprinting center in Tsix affects X-chromosome selection. Here, we identify the insulator and transcription factor, CTCF, as a candidate trans-acting factor for X-chromosome selection. The choice/imprinting center contains tandem CTCF binding sites that function in an enhancer-blocking assay. In vitro binding is reduced by CpG methylation and abolished by including non-CpG methylation. We postulate that Tsix and CTCF together establish a regulatable epigenetic switch for X-inactivation."

Melt is localized at the onset of rapid ice flow in the large ice stream that drains north off the summit dome and other areas in the northeast quadrant of the ice sheet. Locally, high melt rates indicate geothermal fluxes 15 to 30 times continental background. The southern limit of melt coincides with magnetic anomalies and topography that suggest a volcanic origin."

https://openalex.org/W2025899010,"The duplication of the mammalian genome is an organized event, but there is limited information about the precision of the duplication program at specific genetic loci. We developed an approach that allows DNA replication events to be visualized in individual DNA molecules. Studying the latent replication of Epstein-Barr virus episomes, we show that different initiation sites are used to commence DNA replication from a specific portion of the viral genome (zone), whereas termination does not seem to be genomically defined. We conclude that initiation zones and pausing sites are major organizers of the duplication program, but initiation, fork progression, and termination of replication can vary in each molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1991041699,"We report an extensive program of high-precision radiocarbon dating to establish the best date for a floating 1599-year Anatolian tree ring chronology that spans the later third millennium B.C. through the earlier first millennium B.C. This chronology is directly associated with a number of key sites and ancient personages. A previously suggested dating is withdrawn and is replaced by a robust new date fix 22 (+4 or –7) years earlier. These new radiocarbon wiggle-matched dates offer a unique independent resource for establishing the precise chronology of the ancient Near East and Aegean and help resolve, among others, a long-standing debate in favor of the so-called Middle Mesopotamian chronology."
https://openalex.org/W1974799396,"Delineating the molecular mechanisms that are responsive to work overload is crucial to understanding the adaptive processes controlling skeletal muscle mass. We have examined the molecular events associated with increased workload by using microarray analysis to begin to define the mechanotransduction responsive transcription programs in skeletal muscle. Microarray analysis identified 112 mRNAs that were expressed differentially in the soleus muscle of sham-operated vs. gastrocnemius-ablated rats. These genes can be classified into cell proliferation, autocrine/paracrine, extracellular matrix, immune response, intracellular signaling, metabolism, neural, protein synthesis/degradation, structural, and transcription. These findings dramatically increase the number of known, differentially expressed mRNA during early skeletal muscle hypertrophy. In toto, our findings indicate that work overload induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy alters autocrine/paracrine signaling, intracellular signaling, and transcription factor expression, which likely results in a dramatic change in cellular metabolism, cell proliferation, and muscle structure. These data enhance our understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms controlling skeletal muscle mass in response to increased physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W1964910777,"The presence of aggregated alpha-synuclein molecules is a common denominator in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we show that alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is an outstanding substrate for the protein tyrosine kinase p72syk (Syk), which phosphorylates three tyrosyl residues in its C-terminal domain (Y-125, Y-133, and Y-136), as revealed from experiments with mutants where these residues have been individually or multiply replaced by phenylalanine. In contrast, only Y-125 is phosphorylated by Lyn and c-Fgr. Eosin-induced multimerization is observed with wild-type alpha-syn, either phosphorylated or not by Lyn, and with all its Tyr to Phe mutants but not with the protein previously phosphorylated by Syk. Syk-mediated phosphorylation also counteracts alpha-syn assembly into filaments as judged from the disappearance of alpha-syn precipitated upon centrifugation at 100,000 x g. We also show that Syk and alpha-syn colocalize in the brain, and upon cotransfection in Chinese hamster ovary cells, alpha-syn becomes Tyr-phosphorylated by Syk. Moreover, Syk and alpha-syn interact with each other as judged from the mammalian two-hybrid system approach. These data suggest that Syk or tyrosine kinase(s) with similar specificity may play an antineurodegenerative role by phosphorylating a-syn, thereby preventing its aggregation."

https://openalex.org/W1973188364,"In doubly connected superconductors, such as hollow cylinders, the fluxoid is known to be quantized, allowing the superfluid velocity to be controlled by an applied magnetic flux and the sample size. The sample-size-induced increase in superfluid velocity has been predicted to lead to the destruction of superconductivity around half-integer flux quanta. We report transport measurements in ultrathin Al and Au0.7In0.3 cylinders verifying the presence of this destructive regime characterized by the loss of the global phase coherence and reveal a phase diagram featuring disconnected phase coherent regions, as opposed to the single region seen in larger superconducting cylinders studied previously."
https://openalex.org/W1658988635,"There is a disconnect between the scientific promise of bioscience research and the career prospects facing young bioscientists. Bioscientists work longer hours for less pay, spend many years as lowly paid postdocs, and have greater career uncertainty than most highly educated professionals. We apply the economists' tournament job market model to explain career patterns in bioscience research, which is structured so that the chance of winning a prize--an independent academic position, tenure, scientific renown--motivates researchers. We argue that market forces will not improve career prospects for young bioscientists and suggest policy interventions to make careers more economically rewarding and productive."
https://openalex.org/W2080955820,"Vascular endothelium transduces the temporal gradients in shear stress (tau) originating from unsteady blood flow into functional responses. We measured the effects of step-tau and ramp-tau (i.e., t with different temporal shear gradients) on the lipid lateral diffusion coefficient (D) in the apical membranes of confluent cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. A step-tau of 10 dynes/cm2 elicited a rapid (5 s) increase of D in the portion of the cell upstream of the nucleus and a concomitant decrease in the downstream portion. A ramp-tau with a rate of 20 dynes/cm2 per min elicited a rapid (5 s) decrease of D in both the upstream and the downstream portions. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK and JNK were activated by step-tau but not by ramping to the same tau level. Benzyl alcohol, which increases D, enhanced the activities of both MAPKs; cholesterol, which reduces D, diminished these activities. We conclude that the lipid bilayer can sense the temporal features of the applied tau with spatial discrimination and that the tau-induced membrane perturbations can be transduced into MAPK activation. These results have implications for understanding the role of t in modulating vascular functions in health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2068463243,"Radiocarbon dating methods typically assume that there are no significant tropospheric (14)CO(2) gradients within the low- to mid-latitude zone of the Northern Hemisphere. Comparison of tree ring (14)C data from southern Germany and Anatolia supports this assumption in general but also documents episodes of significant short-term regional (14)CO(2) offsets. We suggest that the offset is caused by an enhanced seasonal (14)CO(2) cycle, with seasonally peaked flux of stratospheric (14)C into the troposphere during periods of low solar magnetic activity, coinciding with substantial atmospheric cooling. Short-term episodes of regional (14)CO(2) offsets are important to palaeoclimate studies and to high-resolution archaeological dating."
https://openalex.org/W1968921209,"In the present study, we explored the role of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in a murine model of chronic fungal asthma induced by an intrapulmonary challenge with Aspergillus fumigatus conidia (or spores). Airway hyperresponsiveness was significantly lower in A. fumigatus-sensitized mice lacking CCR5 (CCR5-/-) compared with similarly sensitized wild-type (CCR5+/+) control mice at days 2, 21, 30, and 40 after the conidia challenge. CCR5-/- mice exhibited significantly less peribronchial T-cell and eosinophil accumulation and airway-remodeling features, such as goblet cell hyperplasia and peribronchial fibrosis, compared with CCR5+/+ mice at these times after conidia. However, both groups of mice exhibited similar allergic airway disease at day 12 after the conidia challenge. In CCR5-/- mice at day 12, the allergic airway disease was associated with airway hyperresponsiveness, peribronchial allergic inflammation, and goblet cell hyperplasia. Immunoneutralization of RANTES/CCL5 in sensitized CCR5+/+ and CCR5-/- mice for 12 days after the conidia challenge significantly reduced the peribronchial inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in comparison with control wild-type and knockout mice at this time. These data demonstrate that functional CCR5 and RANTES/CCL5 are required for the persistence of chronic fungal asthma in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2119708073,"Ca2+ regulation of Cl- current induced by cell swelling (I(CI,swell)) in response to hypotonicity was studied in human prostate cancer epithelial cells (LNCaP) by using the patch-clamp technique. Increase of global intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in) to 1 mM as well as variations of the extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]out) in the 0 to 10 mM range did not affect time course of the development, maximal amplitude, rectification properties, and kinetics of I(CI,swell). However, the presence of 0.1 mM thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ pump, resulted in a more than 50% inhibition of ICI,swell. The blockade of plasma membrane store-operated channels (SOCs), activated in the presence of TG, by 2 mM Ni2+ prevented TG-conferred I(CI,swell) inhibition by extracellular Ca2+. In the presence of TG and Ca2+, the cells failed to exhibit regulatory volume decrease. We conclude that interaction between volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) carrying I(CI,swell) and Ca2+ occurs in the microdomains from the inner surface of the membrane that are not accessible to the changes in [Ca2+]in, but can be readily reached by Ca2+ entering the cell via plasma membrane, especially through SOCs. Preferred access of SOC-transported Ca2+ to VRAC suggests colocalization of these channels in the cell membrane."
