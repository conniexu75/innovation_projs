https://openalex.org/W3163855438,"Nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are major immune receptors in plants and animals. Upon activation, the Arabidopsis NLR protein ZAR1 forms a pentameric resistosome in vitro and triggers immune responses and cell death in plants. In this study, we employed single-molecule imaging to show that the activated ZAR1 protein can form pentameric complexes in the plasma membrane. The ZAR1 resistosome displayed ion channel activity in Xenopus oocytes in a manner dependent on a conserved acidic residue Glu11 situated in the channel pore. Pre-assembled ZAR1 resistosome was readily incorporated into planar lipid-bilayers and displayed calcium-permeable cation-selective channel activity. Furthermore, we show that activation of ZAR1 in the plant cell led to Glu11-dependent Ca2+ influx, perturbation of subcellular structures, production of reactive oxygen species, and cell death. The results thus support that the ZAR1 resistosome acts as a calcium-permeable cation channel to trigger immunity and cell death."

https://openalex.org/W3163514413,"Plants have evolved complex nanofibril-based cell walls to meet diverse biological and physical constraints. How strength and extensibility emerge from the nanoscale-to-mesoscale organization of growing cell walls has long been unresolved. We sought to clarify the mechanical roles of cellulose and matrix polysaccharides by developing a coarse-grained model based on polymer physics that recapitulates aspects of assembly and tensile mechanics of epidermal cell walls. Simple noncovalent binding interactions in the model generate bundled cellulose networks resembling that of primary cell walls and possessing stress-dependent elasticity, stiffening, and plasticity beyond a yield threshold. Plasticity originates from fibril-fibril sliding in aligned cellulose networks. This physical model provides quantitative insight into fundamental questions of plant mechanobiology and reveals design principles of biomaterials that combine stiffness with yielding and extensibility."
https://openalex.org/W3160708600,"We report on an extraordinary field effect of the superconducting LaAlO3/KTaO3(111) interface with Tc ~2 K. By applying a gate voltage (VG) across KTaO3, the interface can be continuously tuned from superconducting into insulating states, yielding a dome-shaped Tc-VG dependence. The electric gating has only a minor effect on carrier density as evidenced in the Hall-effect measurement, while it changes spatial profile of the carriers in the interface, hence the carrier's disorder level significantly. As temperature is decreased, the resistance saturates at lowest temperature in both superconducting and insulating sides, despite an initial dramatic dropping or increasing, which suggests an emergence of quantum metallic state associated with failed superconductor and/or fragile insulator. A VG-modulation of the magnetic-field-driven superconductor to insulator quantum phase transition reveals a non-universal criticality."
https://openalex.org/W3161959514,"What makes things twist? Crystallization and chirality have been entangled since Pasteur's observations on chiral tartaric acid crystals, yet there is still limited understanding of how chiral compounds form chiral crystal morphologies. For example, although a chiral seed crystal can promote a particular handedness, it is not clear why such seeds do not do so with 100% efficiency. Ben-Moshe et al. examined chiral nanocrystals of tellurium grown from solution using various electron microscopy and diffraction techniques (see the Perspective by Popov). They found that screw dislocation- mediated growth is responsible for chiral polyhedral shape formation, and chiral crystals can thus form even in the presence of achiral ligands.

https://openalex.org/W3160958203,"The accessibility and transparency of the cornea permit robust stem cell labeling and in vivo cell fate mapping. Limbal epithelial stem cells (LSCs) that renew the cornea are traditionally viewed as rare, slow-cycling cells that follow deterministic rules dictating their self-renewal or differentiation. Here, we combined single-cell RNA sequencing and advanced quantitative lineage tracing for in-depth analysis of the murine limbal epithelium. These analysis revealed the co-existence of two LSC populations localized in separate and well-defined sub-compartments, termed the ""outer"" and ""inner"" limbus. The primitive population of quiescent outer LSCs participates in wound healing and boundary formation, and these cells are regulated by T cells, which serve as a niche. In contrast, the inner peri-corneal limbus hosts active LSCs that maintain corneal epithelial homeostasis. Quantitative analyses suggest that LSC populations are abundant, following stochastic rules and neutral drift dynamics. Together these results demonstrate that discrete LSC populations mediate corneal homeostasis and regeneration."

It is considered by many to be as intrinsic as hunger and thirst, but the neurobiological mechanisms behind curiosity have remained elusive. In mice, Ahmadlou et al. found that a specific population of genetically identified γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)—ergic neurons in a brain region called the zona incerta receive excitatory input in the form of novelty and/or arousal information from the prelimbic cortex, and these neurons send inhibitory projections to the periaqueductal gray region (see the Perspective by Farahbakhsh and Siciliano). This circuitry is necessary for the exploration of new objects and conspecifics. Science , this issue p. eabe9681 ; see also p. 684"
https://openalex.org/W3160394054,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase in activated T cells because of metabolic activity induced to support T cell proliferation and differentiation. We show that these ROS trigger an oxidative stress response that leads to translation repression. This response is countered by Schlafen 2 (SLFN2), which directly binds transfer RNAs (tRNAs) to protect them from cleavage by the ribonuclease angiogenin. T cell-specific SLFN2 deficiency results in the accumulation of tRNA fragments, which inhibit translation and promote stress-granule formation. Interleukin-2 receptor β (IL-2Rβ) and IL-2Rγ fail to be translationally up-regulated after T cell receptor stimulation, rendering SLFN2-deficient T cells insensitive to interleukin-2's mitogenic effects. SLFN2 confers resistance against the ROS-mediated translation-inhibitory effects of oxidative stress normally induced by T cell activation, permitting the robust protein synthesis necessary for T cell expansion and immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3162971530,"Aberrant alternative splicing is a hallmark of cancer, yet the underlying regulatory programs that control this process remain largely unknown. Here, we report a systematic effort to decipher the RNA structural code that shapes pathological splicing during breast cancer metastasis. We discovered a previously unknown structural splicing enhancer that is enriched near cassette exons with increased inclusion in highly metastatic cells. We show that the spliceosomal protein small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A' (SNRPA1) interacts with these enhancers to promote cassette exon inclusion. This interaction enhances metastatic lung colonization and cancer cell invasion, in part through SNRPA1-mediated regulation of PLEC alternative splicing, which can be counteracted by splicing modulating morpholinos. Our findings establish a noncanonical regulatory role for SNRPA1 as a prometastatic splicing enhancer in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3046357466,"The recent advances in language modeling significantly improved the generative capabilities of deep neural models: in 2019 OpenAI released GPT-2, a pre-trained language model that can autonomously generate coherent, non-trivial and human-like text samples. Since then, ever more powerful text generative models have been developed. Adversaries can exploit these tremendous generative capabilities to enhance social bots that will have the ability to write plausible deepfake messages, hoping to contaminate public debate. To prevent this, it is crucial to develop deepfake social media messages detection systems. However, to the best of our knowledge no one has ever addressed the detection of machine-generated texts on social networks like Twitter or Facebook. With the aim of helping the research in this detection field, we collected the first dataset of real deepfake tweets, TweepFake . It is real in the sense that each deepfake tweet was actually posted on Twitter. We collected tweets from a total of 23 bots, imitating 17 human accounts. The bots are based on various generation techniques, i.e., Markov Chains, RNN, RNN+Markov, LSTM, GPT-2. We also randomly selected tweets from the humans imitated by the bots to have an overall balanced dataset of 25,572 tweets (half human and half bots generated). The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle. Lastly, we evaluated 13 deepfake text detection methods (based on various state-of-the-art approaches) to both demonstrate the challenges that Tweepfake poses and create a solid baseline of detection techniques. We hope that TweepFake can offer the opportunity to tackle the deepfake detection on social media messages as well."
https://openalex.org/W3040808709,"Among the many aspects that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic, two seem particularly challenging to understand: i ) the great geographical differences in the degree of virus contagiousness and lethality that were found in the different phases of the epidemic progression, and, ii ) the potential role of the infected people’s blood type in both the virus infectivity and the progression of the disease. A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that, in the subject-to-subject transfer, SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes’ antigens of the source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune reaction in a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific antibodies for the source subject antigens. This hypothesis implies a blood type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the observed heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules based on blood types are taken into account, and we compare our model outcomes with the exiting worldwide infection progression data. We found an overall good agreement, which strengthens the hypothesis that blood types do play a role in the COVID-19 infection."

https://openalex.org/W3163283061,"Drug repurposing studies targeting inhibition of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have exhibited the potential effect of small molecules. In the present work a detailed interaction study between the phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants and the RdRP of SARS-CoV-2 has been performed. The top four phytochemicals obtained through molecular docking were, swertiapuniside, cordifolide A, sitoindoside IX, and amarogentin belonging to Swertia chirayita , Tinospora cordifolia and Withania somnifera . These ligands bound to the RdRP were further studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The principal component analysis of these systems showed significant conformational changes in the finger and thumb subdomain of the RdRP. Hydrogen bonding, salt-bridge and water mediated interactions supported by MM-GBSA free energy of binding revealed strong binding of cordifolide A and sitoindoside IX to RdRP. The ligand-interacting residues belonged to either of the seven conserved motifs of the RdRP. These residues were polar and charged amino acids, namely, ARG 553, ARG 555, ASP 618, ASP 760, ASP 761, GLU 811, and SER 814. The glycosidic moieties of the phytochemicals were observed to form favourable interactions with these residues. Hence, these phytochemicals may hold the potential to act as RdRP inhibitors owing to their stability in binding to the druggable site."
https://openalex.org/W3161278902,"The functional heterogeneity of resident stem cells that support adult organs is incompletely understood. Here, we directly visualize the corneal limbus in the eyes of live mice and identify discrete stem cell niche compartments. By recording the life cycle of individual stem cells and their progeny, we directly analyze their fates and show that their location within the tissue can predict their differentiation status. Stem cells in the inner limbus undergo mostly symmetric divisions and are required to sustain the population of transient progenitors that support corneal homeostasis. Using in situ photolabeling, we captured their progeny exiting the niche before moving centripetally in unison. The long-implicated slow-cycling stem cells are functionally distinct and display local clonal dynamics during homeostasis but can contribute to corneal regeneration after injury. This study demonstrates how the compartmentalized organization of functionally diverse stem cell populations supports the maintenance and regeneration of an adult organ."
https://openalex.org/W3161096839,"Background Unprecedented public health measures have been used during this coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is a challenge to implement timely and appropriate public health interventions. Methods and findings Population and COVID-19 epidemiological data between 21st January 2020 to 15th November 2020 from 216 countries and territories were included with the implemented public health interventions. We used deep reinforcement learning, and the algorithm was trained to enable agents to try to find optimal public health strategies that maximized total reward on controlling the spread of COVID-19. The results suggested by the algorithm were analyzed against the actual timing and intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Early implementations of the actual lockdown and travel restriction policies, usually at the time of local index case were associated with less burden of COVID-19. In contrast, our agent suggested to initiate at least minimal intensity of lockdown or travel restriction even before or on the day of the index case in each country and territory. In addition, the agent mostly recommended a combination of lockdown and travel restrictions and higher intensity policies than the policies implemented by governments, but did not always encourage rapid full lockdown and full border closures. The limitation of this study was that it was done with incomplete data due to the emerging COVID-19 epidemic, inconsistent testing and reporting. In addition, our research focuses only on population health benefits by controlling the spread of COVID-19 without balancing the negative impacts of economic and social consequences. Interpretation Compared to actual government implementation, our algorithm mostly recommended earlier intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Reinforcement learning may be used as a decision support tool for implementation of public health interventions during COVID-19 and future pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W3162635089,"Transcription and metabolism both influence cell function, but dedicated transcriptional control of metabolic pathways that regulate cell fate has rarely been defined. We discovered, using a chemical suppressor screen, that inhibition of the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) rescues erythroid differentiation in bloodless zebrafish moonshine (mon) mutant embryos defective for transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma (tif1γ). This rescue depends on the functional link of DHODH to mitochondrial respiration. The transcription elongation factor TIF1γ directly controls coenzyme Q (CoQ) synthesis gene expression. Upon tif1γ loss, CoQ levels are reduced, and a high succinate/α-ketoglutarate ratio leads to increased histone methylation. A CoQ analog rescues mon's bloodless phenotype. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial metabolism is a key output of a lineage transcription factor that drives cell fate decisions in the early blood lineage."
https://openalex.org/W3160903713,"Background The risk factors associated with the stages of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) disease progression are not well known. We aim to identify risk factors specific to each state of COVID-19 progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection through death. Methods and results We included 648,202 participants from the Veteran Affairs Million Veteran Program (2011-). We identified characteristics and 1,809 ICD code-based phenotypes from the electronic health record. We used logistic regression to examine the association of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, and prevalent phenotypes to the stages of COVID-19 disease progression: infection, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day mortality (separate models for each). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of visit months and ICD codes, state infection rate and controlled for multiple testing using false discovery rate (≤0.1). As of August 10, 2020, 5,929 individuals were SARS-CoV-2 positive and among those, 1,463 (25%) were hospitalized, 579 (10%) were in ICU, and 398 (7%) died. We observed a lower risk in women vs. men for ICU and mortality (Odds Ratio (95% CI): 0.48 (0.30–0.76) and 0.59 (0.31–1.15), respectively) and a higher risk in Black vs. Other race patients for hospitalization and ICU (OR (95%CI): 1.53 (1.32–1.77) and 1.63 (1.32–2.02), respectively). We observed an increased risk of all COVID-19 disease states with older age and BMI ≥35 vs. 20–24 kg/m 2 . Renal failure, respiratory failure, morbid obesity, acid-base balance disorder, white blood cell diseases, hydronephrosis and bacterial infections were associated with an increased risk of ICU admissions; sepsis, chronic skin ulcers, acid-base balance disorder and acidosis were associated with mortality. Conclusions Older age, higher BMI, males and patients with a history of respiratory, kidney, bacterial or metabolic comorbidities experienced greater COVID-19 severity. Future studies to investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with these phenotype clusters and COVID-19 are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3162301212,"The evolution of ecological networks Plants and the animals that eat their fruits and disperse their seeds form complex networks of mutualistic interactions. The structures of many such networks and the ecological forces that shape them are well known, but their deeper evolutionary history has received little attention. Burin et al. address this knowledge gap in a study of frugivorious bird species in documented seed-dispersal networks around the world (see the Perspective by Bello and Barreto). Species occupying central positions in frugivory networks, which thus interact with many plant species, tend to belong to lineages that are more stable over macroevolutionary time scales. These patterns are more evident in regions with warmer and wetter climates and provide evidence that evolutionary processes can leave a signal on the structure of current ecological networks.

https://openalex.org/W3163266811,"Ocean-based economic development arising from an increasing interest in the 'blue economy' is placing ecosystems and small-scale fisheries under pressure. The dominant policy response for dealing with multiple uses is the allocation of coastal space through coastal zone planning (CZP). Recent studies have shown that the rush to develop the blue economy and regulate coastal activity can result in social injustices and the exclusion of less powerful and unrecognized groups (e.g., small-scale fishers, women, Indigenous peoples and youth). To achieve a primary goal of the 2030 sustainable development agenda to ""leave no one behind"", it is important to understand the implications of coastal planning and development for these groups. Here, we present a social survey protocol for examining perceptions of justice related to small-scale fisheries (SSF) in the context of the blue economy in coastal areas. Specifically, we designed the survey instrument and sampling protocol to assess whether decisions about the use of the coastal zone over the last five years have i) followed principles of good governance, ii) recognized fishers' knowledge, culture and rights and iii) been attentive to impacts of changed coastal zone use on fisheries. The survey will engage coastal planners (N = app. 120) and fishers (N = app. 4300) in all the coastal municipalities (N = 81) in Northern-Norway. The sampling protocol is designed to ensure representation of different sectors of society, including those defined by gender, age, ethnicity and occupation (e.g., small-scale fishers, large-scale fishers, coastal planners)."
https://openalex.org/W3189055812,"The number of new cases of leprosy reported worldwide has remained essentially unchanged for the last decade despite continued global use of free multidrug therapy (MDT) provided to any diagnosed leprosy patient. In order to more effectively interrupt the chain of transmission, new strategies will be required to detect those with latent disease who contribute to furthering transmission. To improve the ability to diagnose leprosy earlier in asymptomatic infected individuals, we examined the combined use of two well-known biomarkers of M. leprae infection, namely the presence of M. leprae DNA by PCR from earlobe slit skin smears (SSS) and positive antibody titers to the M. leprae-specific antigen, Phenolic Glycolipid I (anti-PGL-I) from leprosy patients and household contacts living in seven hyperendemic cities in the northern state of Pará, Brazilian Amazon. Combining both tests increased sensitivity, specificity and accuracy over either test alone. A total of 466 individuals were evaluated, including 87 newly diagnosed leprosy patients, 52 post-treated patients, 296 household contacts and 31 healthy endemic controls. The highest frequency of double positives (PGL-I+/RLEP+) were detected in the new case group (40/87, 46%) with lower numbers for treated (12/52, 23.1%), household contacts (46/296, 15.5%) and healthy endemic controls (0/31, 0%). The frequencies in these groups were reversed for double negatives (PGL-I-/RLEP-) for new cases (6/87, 6.9%), treated leprosy cases (15/52, 28.8%) and the highest in household contacts (108/296, 36.5%) and healthy endemic controls (24/31, 77.4%). The data strongly suggest that household contacts that are double positive have latent disease, are likely contributing to shedding and transmission of disease to their close contacts and are at the highest risk of progressing to clinical disease. Proposed strategies to reduce leprosy transmission in highly endemic areas may include chemoprophylactic treatment of this group of individuals to stop the spread of bacilli to eventually lower new case detection rates in these areas."
https://openalex.org/W3160375223,"Sleep disturbance is a common and disruptive symptom of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease (HD). In HD patients, sleep fragmentation appears at an early stage of disease, although features of the earliest sleep abnormalities in presymptomatic HD are not fully established. Here we used novel automated analysis of quantitative electroencephalography to study transitions between wake and non-rapid eye movement sleep in a sheep model of presymptomatic HD. We found that while the number of transitions between sleep and wake were similar in normal and HD sheep, the dynamics of transitions from sleep-to-wake differed markedly between genotypes. Rather than the gradual changes in EEG power that occurs during transitioning from sleep-to-wake in normal sheep, transition into wake was abrupt in HD sheep. Furthermore, transitions to wake in normal sheep were preceded by a significant reduction in slow wave power, whereas in HD sheep this prior reduction in slow wave power was far less pronounced. This suggests an impaired ability to prepare for waking in HD sheep. The abruptness of awakenings may also have potential to disrupt sleep-dependent processes if they are interrupted in an untimely and disjointed manner. We propose that not only could these abnormal dynamics of sleep transitions be useful as an early biomarker of HD, but also that our novel methodology would be useful for studying transition dynamics in other sleep disorders."

Two major types of CNS glial cells, astrocytes and microglia, play critical roles in the development and pathogenesis of CNS diseases. However, the mechanisms by which CBD plays an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective role for these glial cells have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the effects of CBD on the inflammatory response of mouse primary astrocytes and microglia. We also investigated whether the effect of CBD on cytokine release is mediated by the G protein coupled receptor 3 (GPR3), which was recently identified as a novel receptor for CBD. Our results showed that CBD inhibited inflammatory responses of astrocytes and microglia stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand in vitro and in vivo. In addition, CBD reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. However, the inhibitory effect of CBD on pro-inflammatory cytokine production was independent of GPR3 expression in both types of glial cells. Thus, although CBD is effective in ameliorating the activation of astrocytes and microglia, its mechanism of action still requires further study. Our data support the concept that CBD may have therapeutic potential for neurological disorders that involve neuroinflammation."

Hence, this study aimed to provide concrete evidence towards malaria prevention practices and associated factors among Households of Hawassa City Administration, Southern Ethiopia, 2020.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a randomly selected 598 households at Hawassa City Administration from April 1-15, 2020. Multistage sampling technique was employed to recruit the study households. Data were collected by trained data collectors through a face-to-face interview with pretested structured questionnaire, which was adapted from previous peer reviewed articles. Then the data were checked for the completeness and consistencies, then, coded and entered into Epi data 3.1 and it was exported to SPSS IBM version 23 for analysis. Descriptive mean with standard deviation was used to summarize the continuous variables. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess factors affecting prevention and control of Malaria. Finally, adjusted odds ratio together with 95% CI and p-value <0.05 was used to declare the statistical significances.The overall 317 (54.3%) of households practiced good measure of malaria prevention and control measures.

https://openalex.org/W3163022061,"Water movements through the fruit skin play critical roles in many disorders of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) such as water soaking, cracking and shriveling. The objective was to identify the mechanisms of fruit water loss (dry skin, transpiration) and water uptake (wet skin, osmosis). Fruits were held above dried silica gel or incubated in deionized water. Water movements were quantified gravimetrically. Transpiration and osmotic uptake increased linearly with time. Abrading the thin cuticle (0.62 g m-2) increased rates of transpiration 2.6-fold, the rates of osmotic uptake 7.9-fold. The osmotic potential of the expressed juice was nearly the same for green and for white fruit but decreased in red fruit stages. Fruit turgor was low throughout development, except for green fruit. There was no relationship between the rates of water movement and fruit osmotic potential. The skin permeance for transpiration and for osmotic uptake were both high (relative to other fruit species) but were two orders of magnitude greater for osmotic uptake than for transpiration. Incubating fruit in isotonic solutions of osmolytes of different sizes resulted in increases in fruit mass that depended on the osmolyte. The rate of osmotic uptake decreased asymptotically as molecular size of the osmolyte increased. When transpiration and osmotic uptake experiments were conducted sequentially on the same fruit, the rates of transpiration were higher for fruit previously incubated in water. Fluorescence microscopy revealed considerable microcracking in a fruit previously incubated in water. Our findings indicate that the high permeance for osmotic uptake is accounted for by an extremely thin cuticle and by viscous water flow through microcracks and along polar pathways."

For that reason, we conducted a study using a phenomenographic approach in order to understand how university students perceive COVID-19 and the associated lockdown. Data were collected from 25 students in Pakistan. They were asked to demonstrate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in illustrations. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with these students, to gain further insights into their perspectives on the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis revealed four interlinked directions for understanding students’ experiences. These themes were: 1) escape into peace, 2) hope for personal freedom, 3) fear of becoming a victim of COVID-19, and 4) concerns regarding education, future career, and opportunities. All four themes were analyzed and condensed into an outcome space, which further gathers the perceptions of students under one theme as “Hope for life while paradoxically living with fear”. Studying the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on students not only highlighted their concerns, but also emphasized the importance of starting regular psychological evaluations and stress-releasing sessions, along with online education to overcome growing depression."

Subjects/Methods Included in this study were 10 eyes of 5 deceased COVID-19 patients. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via pharyngeal swabs and broncho-alveolar fluids. The highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) and measures was employed during fluid-tissue procurement and preparation. Histopathological examinations and qRT-PCR-testing were carried out for all retinal tissues and vitreous fluids. Results The histopathological examinations revealed no signs of morphologically identifiable retinal inflammation or vessel occlusions based on hematoxylin and eosin stains. By qRT-PCRs, we detected no significant level of viral RNA in human retina and vitreous.

The incremental analysis between varicella vaccination only and the combined programme results in a cost per gained QALY of almost EUR 1.6 million.The results from this study are central components for policy-relevant decision-making, and suggest that it was cost-effective to introduce varicella vaccination in Sweden, whereas herpes zoster vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine for the elderly was not cost-effective-the health effects of the latter vaccination cannot be considered reasonable in relation to its costs. Future observational and surveillance studies are needed to make reasonable predictions on how boosting affects the herpes zoster incidence in the population, and thus the cost-effectiveness of a vaccination programme against varicella. Also, the link between herpes zoster and sequelae need to be studied in more detail to include it suitably in health economic evaluations."
https://openalex.org/W3161027285,"In epidemiology, a typical measure of interest is the risk of disease conditional upon exposure. A common source of bias in the estimation of risks and risk ratios is misclassification. Exposure misclassification affects the measurement of exposure, i.e. the variable one conditions on. This article explains how to assess biases under non-differential exposure misclassification when estimating vaccine effectiveness, i.e. the vaccine-induced relative reduction in the risk of disease. The problem can be described in terms of three binary variables: the unobserved true exposure status, the observed but potentially misclassified exposure status, and the observed true disease status. The bias due to exposure misclassification is quantified by the difference between the naïve estimand defined as one minus the risk ratio comparing individuals observed as vaccinated with individuals observed as unvaccinated, and the vaccine effectiveness defined as one minus the risk ratio comparing truly vaccinated with truly unvaccinated. The magnitude of the bias depends on five factors: the risks of disease in the truly vaccinated and the truly unvaccinated, the sensitivity and specificity of exposure measurement, and vaccination coverage. Non-differential exposure misclassification bias is always negative. In practice, if the sensitivity and specificity are known or estimable from external sources, the true risks and the vaccination coverage can be estimated from the observed data and, thus, the estimation of vaccine effectiveness based on the observed risks can be corrected for exposure misclassification. When analysing risks under misclassification, careful consideration of conditional probabilities is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W3163082812,"Objective Placental abruption is a significant obstetric complication that affects both maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. The present study examined the effect of maternal age on the incidence of placental abruption. Methods We used data of singleton pregnancies from the Japan Environment and Children’s Study, which was a prospective birth cohort study conducted between January 2011 and March 2014 across 15 regional centers in Japan. A multiple regression model was used to identify whether maternal age (&lt;20 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34 years, and ≥35 years) is a risk factor for placental abruption. The analyses were conducted while considering the history of placental abruption, assisted reproductive technology, number of previous deliveries, smoking during pregnancy, body mass index before pregnancy, and chronic hypertension. Results A total of 94,410 Japanese women (93,994 without placental abruption and 416 with placental abruption) were recruited. Herein, 764, 8421, 25915, 33517, and 25793 women were aged &lt;20 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34 years, and ≥35 years, respectively. Besides advanced maternal age (≥35 years; adjusted odds ratio: 1.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.1–2.5), teenage pregnancy was also a risk factor for placental abruption (adjusted odds ratio: 2.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.2–6.5) when the maternal age of 20–24 years was set as a reference. Conclusions In the Japanese general population, besides advanced maternal age, teenage pregnancy was associated with placental abruption. Recently, the mean maternal age has been changing in Japan. Therefore, it is important for obstetric care providers to provide proper counseling to young women based on up-to-date evidence."
https://openalex.org/W3163682437,"This study aimed to assess the use of 33 MHz ultra-high-frequency ultrasonography (33MHz-UHFUS) for evaluating axillary sweat glands with osmidrosis in comparison with histological techniques. Axillary osmidrosis is a common problem in Asian societies, and the number and size of apocrine sweat glands have a strong relationship with osmidrosis severity. Currently, there are no methods to evaluate sweat gland distribution non-invasively.In this study, 35 skin specimens from 10 fresh human cadavers without osmidrosis and retrospective ultrasonographic images from 20 patients with osmidrosis were used. Skin specimens were embedded in paraffin, thinly sliced, and finally stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histologically, the apocrine and eccrine glands were evaluated, and the top and bottom depths of follicles were measured from the skin surface. In 33 MHz ultrasonography images, the depths of sweat glands were measured, and the mean grey value was calculated using Image J.Compared to histological data, 33MHz-UHFUS could be used to identify sweat glands as a hyperechoic structure between the dermis and fat layer. Furthermore, it could evaluate sweat gland distribution but could not distinguish between types of sweat glands.The distribution of sweat glands in the axilla can be non-invasively evaluated via 33MHz-UHFUS."
https://openalex.org/W3118256788,"Background It is of interest to explore the variability in how the COVID-19 pandemic evolved geographically during the first twelve months. To this end, we apply inequality indices over regions to incidences, infection related mortality, and infection fatality rates. If avoiding of inequality in health is an important political goal, a metric must be implemented to track geographical inequality over time. Methods The relative and absolute Gini index as well as the Theil index are used to quantify inequality. Data are taken from international data bases. Absolute counts are transformed to rates adjusted for population size. Results Comparing continents, the absolute Gini index shows an unfavorable development in four continents since February 2020. In contrast, the relative Gini as well as the Theil index support the interpretation of less inequality between European countries compared to other continents. Infection fatality rates within the EU as well as within the U.S. express comparable improvement towards more equality (as measured by both Gini indices). Conclusions The use of inequality indices to monitor changes in geographic inequality over time for key health indicators is a valuable tool to inform public health policies. The absolute and relative Gini index behave complementary and should be reported simultaneously in order to gain a meta-perspective on very complex dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3160146238,"Pbp1, the yeast ortholog of human Ataxin-2, was originally isolated as a poly(A) binding protein (Pab1)-binding protein. Pbp1 regulates the Pan2-Pan3 deadenylase complex, thereby modulating the mRNA stability and translation efficiency. However, the physiological significance of Pbp1 remains unclear since a yeast strain harboring PBP1 deletion grows similarly to wild-type strain on normal glucose-containing medium. In this study, we found that Pbp1 has a role in cell growth on the medium containing non-fermentable carbon sources. While the pbp1Δ mutant showed a similar growth compared to the wild-type cell on a normal glucose-containing medium, the pbp1Δ mutant showed a slower growth on the medium containing glycerol and lactate. Microarray analyses revealed that expressions of the genes involved in gluconeogenesis, such as PCK1 and FBP1, and of the genes involved in mitochondrial function, such as COX10 and COX11, were decreased in the pbp1Δ mutant. Pbp1 regulated the expressions of PCK1 and FBP1 via their promoters, while the expressions of COX10 and COX11 were regulated by Pbp1, not through their promoters. The decreased expressions of COX10 and COX11 in the pbp1Δ mutant were recovered by the loss of Dcp1 decapping enzyme or Xrn1 5'-3'exonuclease. Our results suggest that Pbp1 regulates the expressions of the genes involved in gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial function through multiple mechanisms."

The ring-shaped sliding clamp is loaded onto primer–template junctions of DNA and encircles the double strand, sliding with the progressing replication fork, to act as a moving docking platform for enzymes to bind and maintain proximity to the DNA (4Moldovan G.L.

However, factors that control regulation and recruitment of an appropriate sliding clamp binding partner, at the correct time and location, are not well understood. We and others have suggested that a large portion of this control arises from differences in the binding affinity of proteins for hPCNA, which span four orders of magnitude (3Maga G. Hubscher U.

Such proteins compete to bind hPCNA to gain access to the replication fork, where successful binding is ultimately dictated by hPCNA affinity. The cell-cycle regulator protein, p21CIP1/WAF1 (referred to herein as p21), is the highest affinity hPCNA-interacting protein (PIP) known (KD 2.5–90 nM, (13Wegener K.L. McGrath A.E. Dixon N.E.

This consequently stalls cell-cycle progression to provide a necessary checkpoint for healthy proliferation. p21 requires high affinity for hPCNA to fulfil this role and outcompete other proteins from interacting with hPCNA and hence the replication fork. In contrast, the Y-family translesion polymerases pol λ, pol κ, and pol ι bind hPCNA with micromolar affinity (16Hishiki A. Hashimoto H. Hanafusa T. Kamei K. Ohashi E. Shimizu T. Ohmori H. Sato M.

A fundamental understanding of the molecular-level nuances that dictate hPCNA binding affinity is required to understand the regulation of DNA-replication and DNA-repair processes. Here, we begin to unpack subtle sequence changes that influence hPCNA-binding affinity with an investigation of the structure–activity relationship of peptides that bind hPCNA. The majority of hPCNA partners bind on the surface of a hPCNA subunit located between the two subunit domains, nestled under the interdomain connecting loop (Fig. 1C). PIPs (or hPCNA-interacting peptides) interact with hPCNA through a consensus sequence aptly named the PIP-box motif. The PIP-box motif is defined as Qxxϕxxψψ, where Q is glutamine, ‘x’ is any amino acid, ‘ϕ’ is a hydrophobic residue, and ‘ψ’ is an aromatic residue (commonly Phe or Tyr). Each of the eight positions of the PIP-box are referred to here as positions 1 through 8, or indicated by a superscript P1 through to P8. It has been argued that the PIP-box definition is part of a larger subset of hPCNA-binding motifs as many noncanonical PIP-box peptides, which are defined by the absence of a glutamine at position 1, bind hPCNA with low micromolar or nanomolar affinity (11Prestel A.

The noncanonical definition will be used here for simplicity of discussion. The highly canonical PIP-box motif of p21, 144QTSMTDFY, was initially defined following an alanine mutation scan from Lys141 to Ser160 and revealed Gln144P1, Met147P4, Phe150P7, and Tyr151P8 as the conserved binding residues (positions 1, 4, 7, and 8 (18Warbrick E.

A 22-mer peptide, derived from p21 (residues 139–160), that contains this PIP-box sequence binds to hPCNA as a single well-defined 310-helical turn that is anchored to the hPCNA surface by a hydrophobic triad (Met, Phe, and Tyr). Despite these insights, the scope and tolerance at each position within the PIP-box is not well understood. A number of point mutations in p21 and modifications in p21-derived peptides have been investigated; however, such modifications have been confined to alanine mutations or simple functional modifications (18Warbrick E.

The nonconserved PIP-box residues (positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) of p21139–160 only participate in three 310-helical stabilizing hydrogen bonds (146–149, 147–150, and 147–151) (10Horsfall A.J. Abell A.D. Bruning J.B. Targeting PCNA with peptide mimetics for therapeutic purposes.ChemBioChem. 2019; 21: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O’Donnell M.

Structure of the C-terminal region of p21 WAF1/CIP1 complexed with human PCNA.Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), which has led to the belief that these residues play a limited role in the binding affinity for hPCNA. A thorough investigation is required to develop a nuanced understanding of the key interactions to which the p21 PIP-box sequence owes its high affinity, to begin to understand how affinity for hPCNA plays a role in the regulation of DNA-replication and DNA-repair processes. Here, a series of short p21-derived peptides is reported, with either one- or two-point modifications made in the PIP-box sequence to study the structure–activity relationship of hPCNA-binding peptides and determine the secondary interactions that fine-tune affinity for hPCNA. The amino acids incorporated at each PIP-box position were chosen to reflect those observed at the respective position in native protein PIP-box sequences. A second series of peptides was prepared with native PIP-box sequences from different hPCNA-binding proteins, inserted within the sequence that flanks the p21 PIP-box sequence. This series of peptides allowed a wider array of sequence combinations to be investigated than point modifications and allows direct comparison of the effect of the PIP-box sequence on hPCNA affinity, as the peptides contain the same sequence flanking the PIP-box. The hPCNA-binding affinity of each peptide was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The changes in the structure of the peptides bound to hPCNA were studied by X-ray crystallography and computational modeling studies, and correlated to the hPCNA-binding affinity to uncover interactions responsible for the differences in affinity. These studies inform on the design of three new PIP-box sequences to investigate whether cooperative interactions could be predicted from the interactions observed in the high hPCNA affinity modified p21 peptides. This comprehensive and systematic structure–activity investigation advances the ability to predict hPCNA-binding affinity from PIP-box sequence. In addition, it provides insight into how nature has fine-tuned affinity of PIP-box sequences for hPCNA, which can be leveraged to further investigate how hPCNA regulates the DNA-replication and DNA-repair process or develop inhibitors of these interactions. Fifty-one peptides were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (see Experimental procedures) to allow systematic study of the structure–activity relationship of peptides that bind hPCNA (Table S1). These peptides comprise two control p21 peptides known to bind hPCNA; a series of 27 point-modified p21 peptides; a second series of 19 peptides, where the PIP-box sequence from a number of hPCNA-binding proteins was included between the sequence that flanks the p21 PIP-box; and a final set of three peptides containing entirely new, rationally designed PIP-box sequences. A short p21 sequence 141 to 155 (referred to herein as p21μ) was chosen as it has been reported the p21139–160 sequence can be shortened without drastically impacting affinity (13Wegener K.L. McGrath A.E. Dixon N.E. Oakley A.J. Scanlon D.B. Abell A.D. Bruning J. Rational design of a 310-helical PIP-box mimetic targeting PCNA - the human sliding clamp.Chem. Eur. J. 2018; 24: 11325-11331Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the preparation of this shorter sequence gave less aspartimide formation compared with the longer 22mer, with a M-18 peak in the mass spectrum not apparent for p21μ, in contrast to p21139–160 (unpublished work), thereby improving synthetic yields. All subsequent peptides were based on this shorter p21μ peptide (residues 141–155). Five p21μ peptides with a 144P1 point mutation were prepared: p21μ–Q144K, p21μ–Q144M, p21μ–Q144D, p21μ–Q144S, and p21μ–Q144N. Four of these were inspired by the following noncanonical P1 residues: lysine (pol ι, pol κ), methionine (Cdt2, pol η and RNaseH2B), aspartic acid (poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, PARG), or serine (pol λ) at PIP-box position 1. In addition, asparagine with the amidated, but shorter side chain than glutamine was included (p21μ–Q144N). Five p21μ peptides, with a single amino-acid modification at the conserved position 4 of the PIP-box, were prepared and include valine (p21μ–M147V), isoleucine (p21μ–M147I), or leucine (p21μ–M147L), which are commonly observed in native PIP-box sequences, as well as the smaller but still hydrophobic alanine (p21μ–M147A) and the nonpolar aromatic tryptophan (p21μ–M147W). Aromatic residues, such as phenylalanine and tyrosine, are commonly observed at conserved positions 7 and 8 of the PIP-box. p21μ contains the PheP7TyrP8 combination and consequently three peptides, each with a different permutation of phenylalanine and tyrosine, were prepared (p21μ–Y151F, p21μ–F150Y, and p21μ–FY150/151YF). In addition, a p21μ–F150H peptide was prepared, inspired by the PARG PIP-box. Positively charged residues are commonly observed in native PIP-box sequences at nonconserved positions 2 and 3 (e.g., XPG, FEN1, WRN, PARG, p15, Cdt1). Consequently, eight p21μ peptides with arginine or lysine residues at PIP-box position 2 and/or 3 were prepared (p21μ–T145K, p21μ–T145R, p21μ–S146K, p21μ–S146R, p21μ–TS145/146KK, p21μ–TS145/146KR, p21μ–TS145/146RK, and p21μ–TS145/146RR). Conversely, negatively charged residues are commonly observed at nonconserved positions 5 and 6 of native PIP-box sequences (e.g., pol ι, pol λ, pol κ, p15, Cdt1, XPG, RNaseH2B) and five peptides containing aspartic and/or glutamic acid were prepared (p21μ–T148D, p21μ–T148E, p21μ–TD148/149DE, p21μ–TD148/149EE, and p21μ–D149E). Finally, to investigate a variety of PIP-box sequence combinations, a variety of native PIP-box sequences replaced the p21 PIP-box in a p21μ peptide. Ten canonical PIP-box sequences from hPCNA-binding proteins Cdt1, Pogo, XPG, DNALig1, MCMT, pol δp66, FEN1, p15, WRN, and RecQ5 were chosen, along with eight peptides with noncanonical human PIP-box sequences from pol ι, pol κ, Cdt2, pol η, RNaseH2B, PARG, pol λ, and RFCp14. The PIP-box motif in many of these proteins is located at the protein terminus and does not have a sequence extending C- or N-terminal from the PIP-box (e.g., pol δp66). Consequently, our design allows direct comparison of PIP-box sequence influence on hPCNA affinity and is not influenced by the native flanking sequence. The binding affinity (KD) of each peptide for hPCNA was determined by SPR, and the results are summarized in Figure 2 and Table S2. A representative sample of SPR sensorgrams are included in Fig. S1. p21139–160, prepared as a positive control, bound to hPCNA with a KD value of 4.32 nM (Fig. 2A, Table S2), which agrees with previous literature (13Wegener K.L.

All modified p21 peptides are compared with p21μ throughout the discussion, unless otherwise indicated. The KD value of p21μ is marked as a dashed line on all panels of Figure 2 to provide a benchmark for comparison. The KD values for the modified p21μ peptides spanned four orders of magnitude, with the best binding peptide of these two series having a KD value of 1.83 nM (p21μ–TS145/146RR) and the lowest affinity was 8.14 μM (p21μ–pol λ) (Fig. 2, B and C, Table S2). The binding affinity of p21μ–Cdt2 and p21μ–RecQ5 could not be determined because of nonspecific binding to the sensor chip. Interestingly, the analysis revealed seven peptides with higher affinity than p21μ: p21μ–TS145/146RR (1.83 nM), p21μ–S146R (4.30 nM), p21μ–Cdt1 (8.76 nM), p21μ–Pogo (8.82 nM), p21μ–Y151F (10.6 nM), and p21μ–M147I (11.1 nM) (Fig. 2, B and C). The affinity of canonical PIP-box p21μ peptides (with Gln144P1) here range from 1.83 nM to 3.57 μM (Fig. 2C, ‘canonical’). In general, the noncanonical peptides as a group, unsurprisingly, bound hPCNA with lower affinity than the canonical p21μ peptides (see Fig. 2C). The conformation of the peptides bound to hPCNA was investigated to uncover potential reasons for differences in affinity. Cocrystal structures of p21μ (PDB ID: 7KQ1, 3.30 Å) and p21μ–F150Y bound to hPCNA (PDB ID: 7KQ0, 2.40 Å) were solved. Both served as important controls for our modeling studies: p21μ showed that the shorter peptide binds hPCNA in a similar manner (position on hPCNA surface and secondary structure) as the 22mer p21139–160 peptide (PDB ID: 1AXC), and p21μ–F150Y demonstrated a proof of concept that our docking studies represented the crystal structures accurately. The resulting structures are shown in Figure 3, Figs. S1 and S2, and the data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table S3. The cocrystal structure of p21μ bound to hPCNA (Fig. 1) revealed six intermolecular and three intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3C, Fig. S2 and Table S4). The PIP-box residues 144 to 151 all retain similar conformations to p21139–160 (1AXC, Fig. 3, A and B), which is represented by an RMSD value of 0.51 Å (Table S18). This is also reflected in a high similarity of the buried surface area of the PIP-box residues of p21μ compared with p21139–160 in 1AXC (Table S19). Gln144P1 of p21μ makes a hydrogen bond with Ala252 and Pro253 within the Q-pocket, but not Ala208, in contrast to Gln144P1 of p21139–160 that formed three hydrogen bonds. The side chain of Met147P4 was packed slightly differently to the analogous Met147P4 in p21139–160 (1AXC). The C-terminal residues of hPCNA (Lys254-Asp257) and N-terminal residues of p21μ (141–143) gave well-defined electron density, in contrast to the p21139–160 structure (1AXC) that revealed an electrostatic interaction between Lys141 and Arg142 of p21μ, and Glu256 and Asp257 of hPCNA (Fig. 3C). After this, a larger collection of the modified p21μ peptides were selected for further investigation by computational modeling of the hPCNA-bound peptides, to allow high-throughput analysis of more structures. The crystal structure of p21μ (PDB ID: 7KQ1) bound to hPCNA was used as a starting point for modeling as this peptide is the most similar to the modeled peptides, and the structure was overall similar to the p21139–160 structure bound to hPCNA (PDB ID: 1AXC). The peptides chosen for computational analysis were p21μ–S146R, p21μ–M147I, p21μ–D149E, and p21μ–FY150/151YF as these modifications resulted in the largest increase in affinity for the respective PIP-box position. In addition, a representative group containing native PIP-box sequences was also modeled bound to hPCNA: two canonical PIP-box peptides, p21μ–Pogo and p21μ–pol δp66; two noncanonical PIP-box peptides p21μ–pol ι and p21μ–PARG, as well as seven amino-acid PIP-box peptide p21μ–RFC (Figs. S2–S15). The resulting computationally modeled peptide structures bound to hPCNA were compared with the cocrystal structure of p21μ bound to hPCNA, which revealed the complexed structures were similar overall (Fig. 4A), represented by an average RMSD value of 0.223 Å (Table S18). This in turn suggests that the difference in affinity for hPCNA is due to subtle structural changes. The conserved residues all adopted similar conformations between all peptide structures (Fig. 4B); however, the nonconserved residues (positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) and residues flanking the PIP-box were much more varied (Fig. 4, C and D). Intramolecular (peptide-protein) and intermolecular (peptide-peptide) interactions for each hPCNA-bound peptide structure are summarized in Tables S4, S5–S17. In addition, the hPCNA-bound peptides p21μ, p21μ–pol δp66, p21μ–pol ι, p21μ–PARG, and p21μ–Pogo were compared with the co-crystal structure reported for the analogous native peptide bound to hPCNA, to investigate how the sequence flanking the PIP-box motif influences binding conformation. These structures are p21139–160 (1AXC, (15Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O’Donnell M. Kuriyan J.

The hPCNA-bound peptide cocrystal structures were overlaid (Fig. S16), and the overall peptide conformation (RMSD values in Table S20) and secondary interactions were compared (Table S21). These data reveal the PIP-box of peptides that contain the p21, pol δp66, PARG, or Pogo PIP-box sequences all adopt similar conformations to the native counterpart on binding hPCNA with RMSD values of 0.51, 0.69, 0.49, and 0.69 Å, respectively (Table S20, Fig. S16). However, the pol ι PIP-box–containing peptides bound to hPCNA adopt very different conformations, represented by an RMSD of 1.13 Å (Fig. S16 and Table S20). Finally, the affinity and structural information for these two series of peptides was harnessed to design three new PIP-box sequences in an attempt to test our understanding of the requirements for high-affinity hPCNA binding. These new PIP-box sequences were designed to mimic favorable secondary interactions observed for native PIP-box sequences or point-modified peptides (Fig. 5). These sequences were designed with particular primary sequence combinations in mind that correlated with high hPCNA affinity, or particular secondary interactions that appeared important to stabilize the binding conformation which are highlighted throughout the discussion. These sequences were then synthesized within the p21μ scaffold, as before, to give p21μ–RD1–3. The binding affinity to hPCNA was determined by SPR (Fig. 2D) to reve"

Given the lack of data for tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in pMTCT, rates of early viral suppression with TAF and TDF were evaluated in women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) participating in 2 randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 studies in chronic HBV. Methods In a patient subset meeting WOCBP criteria and with baseline HBV DNA &gt;200,000 IU/mL, rates of viral suppression with TAF or TDF in achieving the target of HBV DNA &lt;200,000 IU/mL at weeks 12 and 24 were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors predictive of failure to suppress HBV DNA to the target level. Results In 275 of 1298 (21%) patients meeting WOCBP criteria with high viral load, 93% and 96% had HBV DNA &lt;200,000 IU/mL at weeks 12 and 24, respectively. Results for TAF (n = 194) vs TDF (n = 81) treatment were similar at weeks 12 and 24 (94% vs. 90% and 97% vs. 93%), respectively. High baseline HBV DNA level, genotype D infection, and prior interferon (week 24 only) were predictive of failure to achieve the target level. Both treatments were well tolerated with TAF showing less impact on renal and bone parameters. Conclusions In WOCBP with high VL, no differences were found between TAF and TDF in reducing HBV DNA to levels associated with lower transmission risk. These data support ongoing studies of TAF for pMTCT."

In this work, we measure life satisfaction through open-ended questionnaires to explore levels and drivers of subjective well-being among 474 adults in three Indigenous societies across the tropics: the Tsimane' in Bolivian lowland Amazonia, the Baka in southeastern Cameroon, and the Punan in Indonesian Borneo. We found that life satisfaction levels in the three studied societies are slightly above neutral, suggesting that most people in the sample consider themselves as moderately happy. We also found that respondents provided explanations mostly when their satisfaction with life was negative, as if moderate happiness was the normal state and explanations were only needed when reporting a different life satisfaction level due to some exceptionally good or bad occurrence. Finally, we also found that issues related to health and-to a lesser extent-social life were the more prominent explanations for life satisfaction. Our research not only highlights the importance to understand, appreciate and respect Indigenous peoples' own perspectives and insights on subjective well-being, but also suggests that the greatest gains in subjective well-being might be achieved by alleviating the factors that tend to make people unhappy."
https://openalex.org/W3162006349,"Many clinical studies reporting accelerometry data use sum score measures such as percentage of time spent in moderate to vigorous activity which do not provide insight into differences in activity patterns over 24 hours, and thus do not adequately depict circadian activity patterns. Here, we present an improved functional data analysis approach to model activity patterns and circadian rhythms from accelerometer data. As a use case, we demonstrated its application in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and age-matched healthy older volunteers (HOV).Data of two studies were pooled for this analysis. Following baseline cognitive assessment participants were provided with accelerometers for seven consecutive days. A function on scalar regression (FoSR) approach was used to analyze 24 hours accelerometer data.Information on 48 HOV (mean age 65 SD 6 years) and 18 patients with MCI (mean age 70, SD 8 years) were available for this analysis. MCI patients displayed slightly lower activity in the morning hours (minimum relative activity at 6:05 am: -41.3%, 95% CI -64.7 to -2.5%, p = 0.031) and in the evening (minimum relative activity at 21:40 am: -48.4%, 95% CI -68.5 to 15.4%, p = 0.001) as compared to HOV after adjusting for age and sex.Using a novel approach of FoSR, we found timeframes with lower activity levels in MCI patients compared to HOV which were not evident if sum scores of amount of activity were used, possibly indicating that changes in circadian rhythmicity in neurodegenerative disease are detectable using easy-to-administer accelerometry.Effects of Brain Stimulation During Nocturnal Sleep on Memory Consolidation in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairments, ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01782391.

https://openalex.org/W3162062118,"This paper contains a theoretical study of epidemic control. It is inspired by current events but not intended to be an accurate depiction of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We consider the emergence of a highly transmissible pathogen, focusing on metropolitan areas. To ensure some degree of realism, we present a conceptual model of the outbreak and early attempts to stave off the onslaught, including the use of lockdowns. Model outputs show strong qualitative—in some respects even quantitative—resemblance to the events of Spring 2020 in many cities worldwide. We then use this model to project forward in time to examine different paths in epidemic control after the initial surge is tamed and before the arrival of vaccines. Three very different control strategies are analyzed, leading to vastly different outcomes in terms of economic recovery and total infected population (or progress toward herd immunity). Our model, which is a version of the SEIQR model, is a time-dependent dynamical system with feedback-control. One of the main conclusions of this analysis is that the course of the epidemic is not entirely dictated by the virus: how the population responds to it can play an equally important role in determining the eventual outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3099060742,"The median of a gamma distribution, as a function of its shape parameter k, has no known representation in terms of elementary functions. In this work we use numerical simulations and asymptotic analyses to bound the median, finding bounds of the form 2-1/k(A + Bk), including an upper bound that is tight for low k and a lower bound that is tight for high k. These bounds have closed-form expressions for the constant parameters A and B, and are valid over the entire range of k > 0, staying between 48 and 55 percentile. Furthermore, an interpolation between these bounds yields closed-form expressions that more tightly bound the median, with absolute and relative margins to both upper and lower bounds approaching zero at both low and high values of k. These bound results are not supported with analytical proofs, and hence should be regarded as conjectures. Simple approximation expressions between the bounds are also found, including one in closed form that is exact at k = 1 and stays between 49.97 and 50.03 percentile."

Here, we conducted a detailed clinical evaluation of four Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in samples from acutely ill COVID-19 patients and in two negative cohorts. Methods 443 serum specimens from serial sampling of 29 COVID-19 patients were used to determine clinical sensitivities. Patients were stratified for the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Individual serum specimens from a pre-COVID-19 cohort of 238 healthy subjects and from a PCR-negative clinical cohort of 257 patients were used to determine clinical specificities. All samples were measured side-by-side with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgG), Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Results Median seroconversion occurred earlier in ARDS patients (8–9 days) than in non-ARDS patients (11–17 days), except for EUR N-IgG. Rates of positivity and mean signal ratios in the ARDS group were significantly higher than in the non-ARDS group. Sensitivities between the four tested immunoassays were equivalent. In the set of negative samples, the specificity of the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) was lower (93.9%) compared to all other assays (≥98.8%) and the specificity of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) was lower (98.8%) than that of Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%). Conclusions Serial sampling in COVID-19 patients revealed earlier seroconversion and higher signal ratios of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as a potential risk marker for the development of ARDS, suggesting a utility for antibody testing in acutely diseased patients."

Evidence is emerging on the influential role of male partners in improving maternal and newborn health. This study analysed the factors that determine men's and women's knowledge and practices in postnatal and neonatal care-seeking, in order to inform design of future interventions.A quantitative, cross-sectional study was undertaken in Bungoma County, Kenya. Women who had recently given birth (n = 348) and men whose wives had recently given birth (n = 82) completed questionnaires on knowledge and care-seeking practices relating to the postnatal period. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate associations with key maternal and newborn health outcomes.51.2% of women and 50.0% of men knew at least one neonatal danger sign, however women knew more individual danger signs than men. In the univariate model, women's knowledge of a least one neonatal danger sign was associated with attending antenatal care ≥4 times (OR 4.46, 95%CI 2.73-7.29, p<0.001), facility birth (OR 3.26, 95%CI 1.89-5.72, p<0.001), and having a male partner accompany them to antenatal care (OR 3.34, 95%CI 1.35-8.27, p = 0.009). Higher monthly household income (≥10,000KSh, approximately US$100) was associated with facility delivery (AOR 11.99, 95%CI 1.59-90.40, p = 0.009).Knowledge of neonatal danger signs was low, however there was an association between knowledge of danger signs and increased healthcare service use, including male partner involvement in antenatal care.

Exposure was the presence of PRE either intraoperatively or in the postanesthetic care unit or both. The primary outcome was length of stay after surgery. The secondary outcome was excess hospital cost excluding surgical cost. Financial information was also compared between PRE and non-PRE. Directed acyclic graphs were used to select the covariates to be included in the multivariate regression models. The predictors of length of stay and excess hospital cost between PRE and non-PRE children are presented as adjusted odds ratio (OR) and cost ratio (CR), respectively with 95% confidence interval (CI).Sixty-three PRE and 249 non-PRE patients were recruited. In the univariate analysis, PRE was associated with length of stay (p = 0.004), postoperative oxygen requirement (p <0.001), and increased hospital charge (p = 0.006). After adjustments for age, history of snoring, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, type of surgery and type of payment, preoperative planned admission had an effect modification with PRE (p <0.001).

https://openalex.org/W3163003344,"Many studies investigating pubertal development use Tanner staging to assess maturation. Endocrine markers in urine and saliva may provide an objective, sensitive, and non-invasive method for assessing development.Our objective was to examine whether changes in endocrine levels can indicate the onset of pubertal development prior to changes in self-rated Tanner stage.Thirty-five girls and 42 boys aged 7 to 15 years were enrolled in the Growth and Puberty (GAP) study, a longitudinal pilot study conducted from 2007-2009 involving children of women enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) in Iowa. We collected saliva and urine samples and assessed pubertal development by self-rated Tanner staging (pubic hair, breast development (girls), genital development (boys)) at three visits over six months. We measured dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in saliva and creatinine-adjusted luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estrone 3-glucuronide (E13G) and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide (Pd3G) concentrations in first morning urine. We evaluated the relationships over time between Tanner stage and each biomarker using repeated measures analysis.Among girls still reporting Tanner breast stage 1 at the final visit, FSH levels increased over the 6-month follow-up period and were no longer lower than higher stage girls at the end of follow-up. We observed a similar pattern for testosterone in boys. By visit 3, boys still reporting Tanner genital stage 1 or pubic hair stage 1 had attained DHEA levels that were comparable to those among boys reporting Tanner stages 2 or 3.Increasing concentrations of FSH in girls and DHEA and testosterone in boys over a 6-month period revealed the start of the pubertal process prior to changes in self-rated Tanner stage. Repeated, non-invasive endocrine measures may complement the more subjective assessment of physical markers in studies determining pubertal onset."
https://openalex.org/W3163065561,"Chronic HIV infection may exacerbate atherosclerotic vascular disease, which at advanced stages presents as necrotic plaques rich in crystalline cholesterol. Such lesions can catastrophically rupture precipitating myocardial infarct and stroke, now important causes of mortality in those living with HIV. However, in this population little is known about plaque structure relative to crystalline content and its chemical composition. Here, we first interrogated plaque crystal structure and composition in atherosclerotic SIV-infected macaques using non-linear optical microscopy. By stimulated Raman scattering and second harmonic generation approaches both amorphous and crystalline plaque lipid was detected and the crystal spectral profile indicated a cholesterol ester (CE) dominated composition. Versus controls, SIV+ samples had a greater number of cholesterol crystals (CCs), with the difference, in part, accounted for by crystals of a smaller length. Given the ester finding, we profiled HIV+ plaques and also observed a CE crystalline spectral signature. We further profiled plaques from Ldlr-/- mice fed a high fat diet, and likewise, found CE-dominate crystals. Finally, macrophage exposure to CCs or AcLDL induced auto-fluorescent puncta that co-stained with the LC3B autophagy sensor. In aggregate, we show that atheromatous plaques from mice, macaques and humans, display necrotic cores dominated by esterified CCs, and that plaque macrophages may induce autophagic vesicle formation upon encountering CCs. These findings help inform our knowledge of plaque core lipid evolution and how the process may incite systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3162716052,"We present a model of the evolution of control systems in a genome under environmental constraints. The model conceptually follows the Jacob and Monod model of gene control. Genes contain control elements which respond to the internal state of the cell as well as the environment to control expression of a coding region. Control and coding regions evolve to maximize a fitness function between expressed coding sequences and the environment. The model was run 118 times to an average of 1.4∙106 'generations' each with a range of starting parameters probed the conditions under which genomes evolved a 'default style' of control. Unexpectedly, the control logic that evolved was not significantly correlated to the complexity of the environment. Genetic logic was strongly correlated with genome complexity and with the fraction of genes active in the cell at any one time. More complex genomes correlated with the evolution of genetic controls in which genes were active ('default on'), and a low fraction of genes being expressed correlated with a genetic logic in which genes were biased to being inactive unless positively activated ('default off' logic). We discuss how this might relate to the evolution of the complex eukaryotic genome, which operates in a 'default off' mode."
https://openalex.org/W3162812057,"Opioid therapy is utilized for a broad range of chronic pain conditions. Several studies have highlighted the adverse effects of opioid medication due to the misuse of these drugs. The gradual increase in the use of opioids has become a global phenomenon and is generating social concern. Several treatment guidelines have strongly recommended assessing the risks and benefits of pharmacological treatment with opioids. These guidelines also recommend the psychological assessment of patients with chronic noncancer pain in order to make informed decisions on the advisability of intervention with opioids. Some authors have emphasized the relevance of assessing the risk of opioid misuse in patients with noncancer chronic pain before initiating treatment.Two studies will be conducted, each with a different primary objective. The primary objective of the first study (Study 1) will be to conduct a comprehensive investigation to identify the factors most closely associated with subsequent opioid misuse; and based on the results of Study 1, the primary objective of the second study (Study 2) will be to develop a brief, reliable, valid, and useful instrument that would enable health care providers to make decisions on opioid prescription and on the required level of monitoring and follow-up. These decisions would have positive consequences for patient wellbeing. Study 1 will include a logistic regression analysis to test the hypothetical model. Study 2 will have a longitudinal design and include three assessment sessions in order to develop a measure to assess the risk of prescribed opioid misuse and to analyse its reliability and validity. Participants will be individuals with chronic noncancer pain attending three Pain Units. These individuals will either be undergoing pharmacological treatment that includes opioid analgesics (Study 1, N = 400) or are going to commence such treatment (Study 2, N = 250)."
