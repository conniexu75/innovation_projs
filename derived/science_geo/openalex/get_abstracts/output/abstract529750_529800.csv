https://openalex.org/W1937980604,"Experimental recovery from retrograde amnesia When memory researchers induce amnesia, they normally assume that the manipulations prevent the memory engram from effective encoding at consolidation. In accordance with this, Ryan et al. found that after the injection of protein synthesis inhibitors, animals could not retrieve a memory. However, to their surprise, the memory could nevertheless be reactivated by light-induced activation of the neurons tagged during conditioning. Increased synaptic strength that is the result of cellular consolidation is thus not a critical requisite for storing a memory. Science , this issue p. 1007"
https://openalex.org/W1866104439,"Mechanical strain regulates the development, organization, and function of multicellular tissues, but mechanisms linking mechanical strain and cell-cell junction proteins to cellular responses are poorly understood. Here, we showed that mechanical strain applied to quiescent epithelial cells induced rapid cell cycle reentry, mediated by independent nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of first Yap1 and then β-catenin. Inhibition of Yap1- and β-catenin-mediated transcription blocked cell cycle reentry and progression through G1 into S phase, respectively. Maintenance of quiescence, Yap1 nuclear exclusion, and β-catenin transcriptional responses to mechanical strain required E-cadherin extracellular engagement. Thus, activation of Yap1 and β-catenin may represent a master regulator of mechanical strain-induced cell proliferation, and cadherins provide signaling centers required for cellular responses to externally applied force."

In higher plants, the PSI core is surrounded by a large light-harvesting complex I (LHCI) that captures sunlight and transfers the excitation energy to the core with extremely high efficiency. We report the structure of PSI-LHCI, a 600-kilodalton membrane protein supercomplex, from Pisum sativum (pea) at a resolution of 2.8 angstroms. The structure reveals the detailed arrangement of pigments and other cofactors—especially within LHCI—as well as numerous specific interactions between the PSI core and LHCI. These results provide a firm structural basis for our understanding on the energy transfer and photoprotection mechanisms within the PSI-LHCI supercomplex."
https://openalex.org/W1823020298,"Functional shape memory alloys need to operate reversibly and repeatedly. Quantitative measures of reversibility include the relative volume change of the participating phases and compatibility matrices for twinning. But no similar argument is known for repeatability. This is especially crucial for many future applications, such as artificial heart valves or elastocaloric cooling, in which more than 10 million transformation cycles will be required. We report on the discovery of an ultralow-fatigue shape memory alloy film system based on TiNiCu that allows at least 10 million transformation cycles. We found that these films contain Ti2Cu precipitates embedded in the base alloy that serve as sentinels to ensure complete and reproducible transformation in the course of each memory cycle."

But what keeps genes within heterochromatin silent? Tchasovnikarova et al. examined the basis for this type of silencing in mammalian cells (see the Perspective by Brummelkamp). They identified a complex of proteins in human cells they called HUSH that kept particular parts of the genome silent by changing associated histone methylation marks.

https://openalex.org/W1599277235,"Oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling plays an important role in regulating global metabolic pathways, including aerobic glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and pyrimidine biosynthesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which EGFR signaling regulates cancer cell metabolism is still unclear. To elucidate how EGFR signaling is linked to metabolic activity, we investigated the involvement of the RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways on metabolic alteration in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) cell lines with activating EGFR mutations. Although MEK inhibition did not alter lactate production and the extracellular acidification rate, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors significantly suppressed glycolysis in EGFR-mutant LAD cells. Moreover, a comprehensive metabolomics analysis revealed that the levels of glucose 6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate as early metabolites in glycolysis and PPP were decreased after inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, suggesting a link between PI3K signaling and the proper function of glucose transporters or hexokinases in glycolysis. Indeed, PI3K/mTOR inhibition effectively suppressed membrane localization of facilitative glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which, instead, accumulated in the cytoplasm. Finally, aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation were down-regulated when GLUT1 gene expression was suppressed by RNAi. Taken together, these results suggest that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is indispensable for the regulation of aerobic glycolysis in EGFR-mutated LAD cells.Background: EGFR signaling maintains aerobic glycolysis, but the molecular mechanism is still undefined.Results: Drug inhibition studies reveal that downstream signaling via the PI3K pathway is critical for glucose transport and metabolism.Conclusion: The PI3K signaling regulates key metabolic activities in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.Significance: These data may guide the development of chemotherapeutic options, including targeting of the PI3K pathway and glucose transporter machinery.

One report has suggested that EGFR physically associates with and stabilizes SGLT1 to promote glucose uptake into cancer cells (24Weihua Z. Tsan R. Huang W.C. Wu Q. Chiu C.H. Fidler I.J. Hung M.C. Survival of cancer cells is maintained by EGFR independent of its kinase activity.Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that mutant EGFR signaling maintains up-regulated aerobic glycolysis, PPP, and de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (11Makinoshima H. Takita M. Matsumoto S. Yagishita A. Owada S.

In this scenario, the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR is dysregulated by gene mutations that lead to aberrant EGFR signaling via the RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (8Haber D.A. Bell D.W.

Here we show that, of these two pathways, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis plays a more critical role in regulating glycolysis in EGFR-mutated LAD and appears to facilitate the proper localization of the glucose transporter GLUT1. Suppression of GLUT1 after blocking with siRNA resulted in decreased lactate production and cell proliferation in EGFR-mutated LAD. These findings indicate that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is responsible for aerobic glycolysis by regulating GLUT1 localization in EGFR-mutated LAD.

EGFR mutant LAD cells were seeded in RPMI 1640 medium containing various concentrations of inhibitors in 96-well cell culture plates. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cell viability was analyzed by WST-8 assay using cell counting kit 8. The optical density of the cell culture medium in each well was read at 450 nm on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Viable cells were enumerated by trypan blue exclusion using a Countess automated cell counter (Life Technologies). Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The protein content of supernatants was quantified by BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins were separated on a commercially available 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Mini-Protean TGX, Bio-Rad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Trans-Blot turbo transfer pack, Bio-Rad). They were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies (1:1000). The primary antibodies used in this study are described above. ECL anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked whole antibody (GE Healthcare, 1:10,000) was used as secondary antibody, and signals were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare) and x-ray films (GE Healthcare). β-actin was used as a loading control. Lactate in culture medium was quantified with a lactate assay kit II according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Biovision, Mountain View, CA). After centrifugation (3500 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), cell culture medium was stored at −20 °C. Samples were diluted in assay buffer and mixed with lactate reaction mixture for 30 min. The optical density of the mixture in each well was measured at 450 nm on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The lactate concentration was calculated from a standard curve and normalized against cell numbers and time. ECAR and OCR were measured with an XF glycolysis stress test kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Seahorse Bioscience). In brief, 4.5 × 104 cells were plated onto XF24 plates in RPMI 1640 medium (10% FBS and 2 mm glutamine) and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight. Medium including DMSO or inhibitors was placed into each well, and cells were incubated for 6 h. Cells were washed with assay medium (minus glucose and unbuffered RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, R1383)), replaced with assay medium, and then placed at 37 °C in a CO2-free incubator for 30 min. ECAR and OCR were monitored using a Seahorse Bioscience XF24 extracellular flux analyzer over time. Each cycle consisted of 3 min of mixing, 3 min of waiting, and 3 min of measuring. Glucose, oligomycin, and 2-deoxy-d-glucose were diluted into XF24 medium and loaded into the accompanying cartridge to achieve final concentrations of 10 mm, 5 μm, and 100 mm, respectively. H1975 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm [U-13C]glucose ([13C]Glc6) in the presence of DMSO, AZD9291, or PKI-587. Metabolic extracts were prepared after 6 h of incubation and analyzed using a capillary electrophoresis (CE)-connected electrospray ionization (ESI)-TOFMS and CE-MS/MS system (Human Metabolome Technologies; HMT, Inc., Tsuruoka, Japan, F-SCOPE) (25Ohashi Y.

All immunohistochemistry analyses were performed on paraffin-embedded tissues obtained from the primary tumor in the surgical specimen. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Center, Japan (no. 2014-325). All EGFR mutation status information used in this study was obtained from a database at the Division of Thoracic Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Japan. We prepared and used 4-μm-thick paraffin sections cut from a paraffin block containing histological findings that were representative of the tumor. Antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer solution (pH 6.0). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min, and all slides were heated to 95 °C by exposure to microwave radiation for 20 min. Slides were washed in PBS, and, after 1-h incubation at room temperature with the primary antibodies, the slides were incubated for 30 min with a labeled polymer EnVision TM+ peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Dako, Tokyo, Japan). The chromogen used was 2% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.3% hydrogen. Cells were seeded in a Ibidi 35-mm microdish (Martinsried, Germany) and cultured overnight. They were then incubated with inhibitors for 6 h. Cells were washed three times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After washing, the fixed cells were treated with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 3% TritonX-100, and PBS) and incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing, cells were incubated in secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG) for 1 h, stained with DAPI, mounted with Vectashield mounting medium, and analyzed using a confocal microscopy laser-scanning microscope 710 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To quantitatively detect the expression of membrane-bound GLUT1, cells were fixed with 80% ethanol, incubated with anti-GLUT1 antibody (Abcam), and then stained with the appropriate FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Quantification of FITC fluorescence intensity was performed using a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). LAD cells (1.0 × 105) were transfected with 5 nm siGLUT1#1 (catalog no. s12925, Thermo Fisher Scientific), siGLUT1#2 (catalog no. s12926, Thermo Fisher Scientific), or siNC (catalog no. 4390843, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Unless indicated otherwise, results are reported as mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were done by two-tailed Student's t test. We studied three lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that possessed the EGFR mutation in either exon 19 or exon 21. The cell lines HCC827 and PC-9 both carried the delE746-A750 mutation, whereas NCI-H1975 cells carried EGFR L858R plus T790M, a mutation that confers resistance to erlotinib. First, we confirmed that the HCC827 and PC-9 cell lines were highly sensitive to the EGFR TKI erlotinib (Fig. 1, A and B), with IC50 values in the nanomolar range compared with the erlotinib-resistant H1975 (Fig. 1C). We also treated H1975 cells with AZD9291, a selective third-generation irreversible EGFR inhibitor of T790M resistance mutants (27Cross D.A. Ashton S.E. Ghiorghiu S. Eberlein C. Nebhan C.A.

Here we confirmed that AZD9291 reduced viability in H1975 cells to a greater extent compared with erlotinib after 3 days of treatment (Fig. 1D). Several signaling pathways related to cellular proliferation and survival are activated downstream of EGFR, including the RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. AZD6244 (selumetinib) is a non-ATP competitive inhibitor and highly specific for MEK, a key enzyme in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, whereas NVP-BEZ235 (dactolisib) and PKI-587 (gedatolisib) are dual pan PI3K and mTOR inhibitors. Compared with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (IC50 = >10 μm), treatment with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 inhibited growth of all three cell lines more effectively, with similar dose-dependent decreases in viability (mean IC50 = 11, 5, and 42 nm for the HCC827, PC-9, and H1975 cell lines, respectively) (Fig. 1, A–C). In addition, PKI-587 also effectively kills H1975 cells harboring the T790M resistance mutation (Fig. 1D). To verify that the compounds used inhibited the corresponding signaling pathways, phosphorylation of EGFR signaling molecules was investigated by Western blot (WB) analysis in HCC827, PC-9, and H1975 cells (Fig. 2). We examined the effect of the inhibitors on molecular markers of the EGFR signaling cascade (EGFR, AKT, and ERK) in LAD cells incubated in the presence of erlotinib, AZD6244, BEZ235, AZD9291, and PKI-587, respectively. WB analysis showed that phosphorylation of EGFR (pEGFR), AKT (pAKT), and ERK (pERK) was inhibited at 6 h after erlotinib treatment in HCC827 and PC9 cells (Fig. 2). Alterations in any of the major EGFR signaling cascades were not observed in EGFR TKI-resistant H1975 cells treated with erlotinib, whereas treatment with AZD9291 down-regulated phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream signaling (Fig. 2). AZD6244 treatment inhibited the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway and slightly increased AKT phosphorylation in all three cell lines (Fig. 2). Signaling through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was down-regulated in all three cell lines in the presence of BEZ235 and PKI-587 (Fig. 2), as shown by decreased pAKT and consistent with previous reports (28Qu Y.

Deep sequencing of a thermophilic cyanobacterial population and analysis of the statistics of synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed a high rate of homologous recombination and departures from neutral drift consistent with the effects of genetic hitchhiking. A sequenced isolate genome resembled an unlinked random mixture of the allelic diversity at the sampled loci.

One major difficulty is dating ice-rafted debris deposits associated with Heinrich events: Extensive iceberg influxes into the North Atlantic Ocean linked to global impacts on climate and biogeochemistry. In a new ice core record of atmospheric methane with ultrahigh temporal resolution, we find abrupt methane increases within Heinrich stadials 1, 2, 4, and 5 that, uniquely, have no counterparts in Greenland temperature proxies. Using a heuristic model of tropical rainfall distribution, we propose that Hudson Strait Heinrich events caused rainfall intensification over Southern Hemisphere land areas, thereby producing excess methane in tropical wetlands. Our findings suggest that the climatic impacts of Heinrich events persisted for 740 to 1520 years."

In this study, we present an in silico analysis of neuropeptide genes within the female M. rosenbergii eyestalk, central nervous system, and ovary. We could confidently predict 37 preproneuropeptide transcripts, including those that encode bursicons, crustacean cardioactive peptide, crustacean hyperglycemic hormones, eclosion hormone, pigment-dispersing hormones, diuretic hormones, neuropeptide F, neuroparsins, SIFamide, and sulfakinin. These transcripts are most prominent within the eyestalk and central nervous system. Transcript tissue distribution as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of selected neuropeptide genes of interest mainly in the nervous tissues while others were additionally present in the non-nervous tissues. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of eyestalk peptides confirmed the presence of the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone precursor.

But how and when these features formed is much debated, with distinct implications for solar system formation, dynamics, and geology. We show that these features could be a direct result of accretionary collisions, based on three-dimensional impact simulations using realistic constitutive properties. We identify two regimes of interest: layer-forming splats and mergers resulting in bilobed shapes. For bodies with low tensile strength, our results can explain key morphologies of cometary nuclei, as well as their low bulk densities. This advances the hypothesis that nuclei formed by collisional coagulation-either out of cometesimals accreting in the early solar system or, alternatively, out of comparable-sized debris clumps paired in the aftermath of major collisions."

Candidate miRNAs were selected from studies describing circulating miRNA microarray data in the Gene Expression Omnibus or ArrayExpress. miRNA expression data of healthy controls were retrieved from each study. For each sample type, we selected those miRNAs that were least variable and sufficiently highly expressed in multiple microarray experiments, performed on at least 2 different platforms. Stability of the candidate miRNAs was assessed using NormFinder and geNorm algorithms in a RT-qPCR cohort of 10 patients with coronary artery disease and 10 healthy controls. We selected miRNA normalization panels for RT-qPCR measurements on whole blood, platelets, and serum. As a validation, we assessed the precision of all 3 panels in 3 independent RT-qPCR cohorts and compared this with normalization for miR-16 or RNU6B.

https://openalex.org/W382046725,"Considerable evidence indicates that sleep is essential for learning and memory. Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a novel model for studying sleep. We previously found a short sleeper mutant, fumin (fmn), and identified its mutation in the dopamine transporter gene. We reported similarities in the molecular basis of sleep and arousal regulation between mammals and Drosophila. In aversive olfactory learning tasks, fmn mutants demonstrate defective memory retention, which suggests an association between sleep and memory. In an attempt to discover additional sleep related genes in Drosophila, we carried out a microarray analysis comparing mRNA expression in heads of fmn and control flies and found that 563 genes are differentially expressed. Next, using the pan-neuronal Gal4 driver elav-Gal4 and UAS-RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown individual genes, we performed a functional screen. We found that knockdown of the NMDA type glutamate receptor channel gene (Nmdar1) (also known as dNR1) reduced sleep. The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) plays an important role in learning and memory both in Drosophila and mammals. The application of the NMDAR antagonist, MK-801, reduced sleep in control flies, but not in fmn. These results suggest that NMDAR promotes sleep regulation in Drosophila."

Small case studies demonstrate feline DM also occurs as a result of insulin resistance due to a somatotrophinoma. The current study estimates the prevalence of hypersomatotropism or acromegaly in the largest cohort of diabetic cats to date, evaluates clinical presentation and ease of recognition. Diabetic cats were screened for hypersomatotropism using serum total insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; radioimmunoassay), followed by further evaluation of a subset of cases with suggestive IGF-1 (>1000 ng/ml) through pituitary imaging and/ or histopathology. Clinicians indicated pre-test suspicion for hypersomatotropism. In total 1221 diabetic cats were screened; 319 (26.1%) demonstrated a serum IGF-1>1000 ng/ml (95% confidence interval: 23.6-28.6%). Of these cats a subset of 63 (20%) underwent pituitary imaging and 56/63 (89%) had a pituitary tumour on computed tomography; an additional three on magnetic resonance imaging and one on necropsy. These data suggest a positive predictive value of serum IGF-1 for hypersomatotropism of 95% (95% confidence interval: 90-100%), thus suggesting the overall hypersomatotropism prevalence among UK diabetic cats to be 24.8% (95% confidence interval: 21.2-28.6%). Only 24% of clinicians indicated a strong pre-test suspicion; most hypersomatotropism cats did not display typical phenotypical acromegaly signs. The current data suggest hypersomatotropism screening should be considered when studying diabetic cats and opportunities exist for comparative acromegaly research, especially in light of the many detected communalities with the human disease."

Although most of the 23 human claudins end in a similar Tyr-Val canonical PDZ binding motif (see Fig. 1), their more upstream residues are both shared and distinct (6Van Itallie C.M. Tietgens A.J.

Potentially their localization at the barrier, turnover, trafficking, and selective barrier properties might be influenced by the specificity and affinity of binding to cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins, such as ZO-1. Furthermore, it seems reasonable to speculate that the affinity of claudins for the PDZ domains of the scaffolding proteins is dynamically regulated to allow remodeling during cell-cell movements.

Because of the prevalence of PDZ domains and their role in myriad cellular events, there has been considerable interest in understanding the structural basis for this type of protein-protein interaction and whether these interactions are regulated (7Luck K.

The emerging contribution of sequence context to the specificity of protein interactions mediated by PDZ domains.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 2648-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Within the human genome alone there are >150 PDZ domain-containing proteins, many with multiple PDZ domains (8Wang C.K. Pan L. Chen J. Zhang M. Extensions of PDZ domains as important structural and functional elements.Protein Cell. 2010; 1: 737-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The claudin-binder ZO-1, the focus of this work, contains three tandem PDZ domains in its N terminus, and it is the first PDZ domain (PDZ1) that binds claudins. The second (PDZ2) binds connexins, which are gap junction proteins, showcasing the diverse role of ZO-1 in cellular junctions. Interestingly, PDZ2 is also required for ZO-1 homo- and heterodimerization with other ZO proteins via a unique domain-swapping mechanism (9Fanning A.S. Lye M.F. Anderson J.M. Lavie A.

This dimerization is critical for normal tight junction barrier formation (11Rodgers L.S. Beam M.T. Anderson J.M. Fanning A.S. Epithelial barrier assembly requires coordinated activity of multiple domains of the tight junction protein ZO-1.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Finally, the third ZO-1 PDZ domain (PDZ3) binds the tight junction protein JAM-A (12Nomme J. Fanning A.S. Caffrey M. Lye M.F. Anderson J.M. Lavie A.

Thus, ZO-1 can assemble multiprotein complexes with multiple junction proteins via its three PDZ domains. Here we examine in detail the interaction between claudin-1 and -2 to PDZ1 of ZO-1. The first studies of claudin binding to ZO-1, which were based on mutational deletions, suggested a requirement for the C-terminal residue, position 0 (P0), and the residue at position −2 (P−2) of the ligand for binding to its cognate PDZ-domain (2Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. Direct binding of three tight junction-associated MAGUKs, ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3, with the COOH termini of claudins.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The accepted nomenclature used to refer to residues binding to PDZ domains is as follows. The C-terminal residue is referred to as the P0 residue; subsequent residues toward the N terminus are termed P−1, P−2, P−3, etc. More recent studies reveal a role for residues at positions P−1, P−3, P−4, and P−5 in defining specificity (13Ye F. Zhang M. Structures and target recognition modes of PDZ domains: recurring themes and emerging pictures.Biochem. J. 2013; 455: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the “general model” the claudin's P0 hydrophobic side chain inserts into a hydrophobic pocket, and the C-terminal carboxylate coordinates with a largely conserved GLGF motif within the PDZ domain (7Luck K. Charbonnier S. Travé G. The emerging contribution of sequence context to the specificity of protein interactions mediated by PDZ domains.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 2648-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The preceding several residues build an antiparallel strand to the β2 strand of the PDZ domain. In contrast to specificity, not much is known about what determines the interaction affinity. Most reported affinities are relatively low and in the micromolar range (14Zhang Y. Yeh S. Appleton B.A. Held H.A. Kausalya P.J. Phua D.C. Wong W.L. Lasky L.A. Wiesmann C. Hunziker W. Sidhu S.S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 22299-22311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the implication of evidence in several studies is that phosphorylation of claudins near their PDZ binding motifs alters affinity for ZO-1. For example, the cytoplasmic tails of many claudins are documented to be phosphorylated at multiple positions including serines, threonines, and tyrosines (15Findley M.K. Koval M. Regulation and roles for claudin-family tight junction proteins.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Changes in phosphorylation have been correlated with changes in barrier properties, trafficking, and turnover, cited in Van Itallie et al. (6Van Itallie C.M. Tietgens A.J. LoGrande K. Aponte A.

Similar correlative findings have been reported after introducing phosphomimicking mutations (i.e. mutating the Ser/Thr/Tyr residue to Asp or Glu) although the mechanisms underlying these changes are not defined (16Ikari A.

Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 4902-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and because this position has a tyrosine residue in 9 of the 23 human claudins (Fig. 1). To better understand the specificity and affinity for the interaction of different claudins with ZO-1, we defined the structural basis for the interaction of ZO-1 PDZ1 with claudin-1, which lacks Tyr−6, and claudin-2, which contains Tyr−6. Surprisingly, there are distinct and significant differences between the way claudin-1 binds PDZ1 and the way claudin-2 binds PDZ1. Contacts of claudin-2 with the PDZ1 domain include residues more distal from the C terminus than does claudin-1. Specifically, the tyrosine residue present in claudin-2 at P−6 intercalates between the β2-β3 loop of the core PDZ1 domain. This observation suggested that due to the more extensive interaction, claudin-2 would bind more tightly than claudin-1 to PDZ1. Isothermal thermal calorimetry and NMR experiments verified this prediction. The functional relevance of the tyrosine residue was probed by introducing the phosphomimicking mutation Y224E (mimicking not the structure of a phosphorylated tyrosine, but charge), which revealed that the mutation at this site interrupts in vitro binding to PDZ1 and results in loss of the claudin-2 barrier properties in cultured MDCK cells. The modulation of claudin-2 binding to PDZ1 by phosphorylation state of Tyr-224 suggests a potential mechanism for physiologic regulation of affinity. These results can be applied to a better understanding of the regulation of claudin function at the tight junction and potentially be generalized to PDZ-ligand interactions outside the tight junction. For the ZO-1 PDZ1 domain, a DNA fragment encoding for residues 18–110 of human ZO-1 was cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of a pET14b expression vector that includes the tobacco etch virus cleavage site. In addition, the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Agilent Technologies was used to fuse 10-residue extensions to the C terminus of PDZ1 to produce PDZ1-Cld1 (extension, -GGGSSGKDYV), PDZ1-Cld2 (extension, -GGGYSLTGYV), and PDZ1-Cld2Y224E (extension, -GGGESLTGYV). Human claudin tails were cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of a modified pET14b expression vector that includes a SUMO tag. 13-Residue extensions were thus inserted to generate the following constructs: His-SUMO-Cld1 (extension, -YPKPAPSSGKDYV), His-SUMO-Cld2 (extension, -KSEFNSYSLTGYV), and His-SUMO-Cld2Y224E (extension, -KSEFNSESLTGYV). All recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21 C41). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 2YT medium then induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 0.6 absorbance (600 nm) and left to grow overnight at 22 °C. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 min. Pellets were resuspended and washed with 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Lysis was accomplished by sonication in a buffer composed of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm PMSF. After centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 1 h, the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml His-trap nickel affinity column (GE Healthcare), and the column was washed with 300 ml of buffer A composed of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl supplemented with 25 mm imidazole. Two supplemental wash steps were performed by flowing 100 ml of buffer A supplemented with (i) 50 mm then (ii) 75 mm imidazole. The bound protein was then eluted in buffer A supplemented with 500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated. All ZO-1 PDZ1 constructs were cleaved using tobacco etch virus protease, and the cut protein was injected onto a S-200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The purity of the protein preparations was confirmed using SDS-PAGE and detected through Coomassie staining. Proteins were concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml (ZO1-PDZ1) and ∼12 mg/ml (ZO1-PDZ1-Clds) and stored at −80 °C until used for crystallization experiments. After elution of the His-trap column, all His-SUMO-Clds constructs were concentrated and stored at −80 °C until used for calorimetry experiments. The acetylated heptapeptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of human claudin-1 (sp_O95832), claudin-2 (sp_P57739), claudin-2 with a phosphorylated tyrosine at position −6, and claudin-2Y224E (the mutated claudin-2 at position −6) were prepared by Biomatik Corp. (Cambridge, MA). The amino acid composition and purity (>98%) of peptides were verified by mass spectroscopy and HPLC analysis by the manufacturer. ITC experiments were performed on a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal). All ITC experiments involved direct titration of the His-SUMO ligand or acetylated peptide ligand into protein solution. PDZ1 (12.5 μm) was thus titrated with 5–10-μl injections of His-SUMO-Claudin tails (330–1600 μm) or ac-Cld2 (450 μm). All proteins were dialyzed against the same buffer of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and an aliquot of the latter dialysis buffer was used for dilutions and blank experiments. Experiments were performed at 25 °C; 5–10-μl injections were performed at 200-s intervals, stirring speed used was 307 rpm, and reference power was 10 μcal/s. The first injection peak was systematically discarded because of the backlash effect of the syringe plunger. Heats of dilution were measured in blank titrations by injecting the ligands into buffer and subtracted from the observed raw heat values. Control experiments were performed and consisted of injecting PDZ1 into buffer and His-SUMO into PDZ1 solution, but these titrations did not produce a significant signal. Data-fitting was based on a one-site binding model using the commercial package provided (Origin) to obtain the values of Kd, ΔH, and ΔS. Each titration was recorded at least in duplicate. NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe. Experimental conditions were 200 μm peptide, ±20 μm protein in 100 mm PO4, pH 7.2, in 90% 1H2O, 10% 2H2O at 25 °C in 3-mm NMR tubes. The WaterLOGSY experiments were performed as described previously (18Antanasijevic A. Cheng H. Wardrop D.J. Rong L. Caffrey M. Inhibition of influenza H7 hemagglutinin-mediated entry.PloS One. 2013; 8: e76363Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The data were collected with a sweep width of 14,370 Hz and a relaxation delay of 2 s. Water was selectively saturated using a 2-ms square-shaped pulse with a mixing time of 2 s. All data were processed by NMRPipe (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol.

Crystals of the PDZ1-Cld1 and PDZ1-Cld2Y224E proteins were grown at 20 °C using hanging drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 20–40% PEG 2000 monomethyl ether, 0.1 m sodium acetate (NaAc), pH 4.6, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, whereas PDZ1-Cld2 protein crystals where grown at 12 °C against a reservoir containing 2.0 m sodium formate, 0.1 m NaAc, pH 4.6. Drops of 2.0 μl were set up at a 1:1 ratio of reservoir-to-protein solution at a concentration of 7–10 mg/ml. Before data collection, crystals were transferred into a solution containing 80% of the mother liquor, 20% glycerol for cryoprotection. Diffraction data for all constructs were collected on the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) ID-G using a MARCCD 300 detector at a temperature of 100 K and a wavelength of 0.9785 Å. Data were processed and scaled with XDS and XSCALE (20Kabsch W. Xds.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11228) Google Scholar).

The unliganded ZO-1 PDZ1 domain structure was obtained from crystals that contained the PDZ1-Cld2Y224E fusion protein. Because we did not observe electron density for the residues corresponding to the modified claudin-2 tail sequence, we designate this as the unliganded ZO-1 PDZ1 structure. This 1.9 Å resolution structure is very similar to the 2.9 Å resolution structure previously reported (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.22 Å on 82 atoms with PDB entry 2H3M (22Appleton B.A. Zhang Y.

A claudin-2 Y224E mutant was generated using the Agilent QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit with the following sense primer (antisense primers are the reverse complement): 5′-CAAAGCCAAGAGTGAGTTCAACTCAGAAAGCCTGACTGGGT-3′. Stable cell lines were generated as described previously in Tet-off MDCK II cells. pTRE claudin-2 Y224E vectors were co-transfected with pTKhyg, and clones were selected by culturing cells in 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Two clonal cell lines were selected and characterized. For all localization and barrier assays cells were grown on Transwell filters (Corning) for 5 days. Measurement of dilution potential and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was carried out as previously described (25Colegio O.R. Van Itallie C. Rahner C. Anderson J.M.

Claudin and tubulin antibodies were purchased from Life Technologies; IR-coupled secondary antibodies were from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). For the purpose of studying the structure of the human ZO-1 PDZ1 domain in complex with the C terminus of human claudin-1 and -2, we attempted both co-crystallization and soaking methods using heptapeptides corresponding to the respective claudin sequences. However, we did not observe electron density at the PDZ1 binding region, presumably due to steric limitations caused by crystal packing. Therefore, we took advantage of a previously described strategy in which the claudin C-terminal residues are fused at the C terminus of the PDZ domain via a tri-glycine linker (22Appleton B.A. Zhang Y. Wu P. Yin J.P. Hunziker W. Skelton N.J. Sidhu S.S. Wiesmann C. Comparative structural analysis of the Erbin PDZ domain and the first PDZ domain of ZO-1.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), such that the residues corresponding to the claudin would bind to a PDZ1 domain of a neighboring molecule. Using this approach we determined the crystal structures of the ZO-1 PDZ1 domain in complex with the 7-most C-terminal residues of claudin-1 (-SSGKDYVCOOH, referred to as PDZ1-Cld1) and claudin-2 (-YSLTGYVCOOH, PDZ1-Cld2). See Table 1 for detailed data collection and refinement statistics. In addition, because we had previously determined by mass spectrometry that the claudin-2 P−6 tyrosine could be phosphorylated in vivo (6Van Itallie C.M. Tietgens A.J. LoGrande K. Aponte A. Gucek M. Anderson J.M. Phosphorylation of claudin-2 on serine 208 promotes membrane retention and reduces trafficking to lysosomes.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 4902-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we crystallized a construct containing PDZ1 followed by a claudin-2 sequence mutated at P−6 with a phosphomimicking mutation: -ESLTGYVCOOH (PDZ1-Cld2Y224E). However, when we solved this structure at 1.9 Å resolution, we could not observe electron density for the claudin-2-related residues and hence regard this structure as a high resolution unliganded PDZ1 structure. All comparisons to claudin-1- and -2-bound PDZ1 complexes are done relative to this high resolution structure.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsPDZ1PDZ1-Cld1PDZ1-Cld2PDB codes4OEO4OEP4YYXData collection statisticsResolutionaThe last shell is in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab We determined the crystal structure of the ZO-1 PDZ1 domain in complex with the C-terminal residues of human claudin-1 (-SSGKDYV) at a resolution of 2.35 Å (Table 1). PDZ1-Cld1 crystallized in the P41212 space group with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (depicted in light blue and red, Fig. 2A). The residues corresponding to the claudin-1 C-terminal sequence from one protomer (e.g. light blue, Fig. 2A) bind to the PDZ1 domain related by crystallographic symmetry (purple, Fig. 2A). The PDZ1 domains of the two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit are essentially identical (r.m.s.d. of 0.29 Å on 86 atoms) as is the conformation of the claudin-1 residues. However, the precise relative orientation of PDZ1 to claudin-1 differs between the molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2B), made possible by the three glycine residues that link the PDZ1 domain to the claudin-1 sequence. The observed flexibility of the linker suggests that no artificial constraints (e.g. linker, crystal contacts) determine the precise conformation of the claudin-1 residues. Superimposition of the unliganded and claudin-1-bound PDZ1 structures reveals that binding of claudin-1 does not generate a conformational change within the PDZ1 domain (r.m.s.d. of"

In order to understand the molecular processes underlying this phenomenon, we have examined seasonal variation in the transcriptome of 606 healthy individuals. We show that 74 transcripts associated with a 12-month seasonal cycle were enriched for processes involved in DNA repair and binding. An additional 94 transcripts demonstrated significant seasonal variability that was largely influenced by blood cell count levels. These transcripts were enriched for immune function, protein production, and specific cellular markers for lymphocytes. Accordingly, cell counts for erythrocytes, platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, and CD19 cells demonstrated significant association with a 12-month seasonal cycle. These results demonstrate that seasonal variation is an important environmental regulator of gene expression and blood cell composition. Notable changes in leukocyte counts and genes involved in immune function indicate that immune cell physiology varies throughout the year in healthy individuals."

Like the SecYEG translocon, the YidC protein family facilitates co-translational substrate insertion involving ribosome binding to initiate the insertion process. The C-terminal regions of the mitochondrial Oxa1 and Streptococcus mutants YidC1 and YidC2 have been shown to be crucial for the contact with ribosomes (21Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W.

In E. coli, the C terminus of YidC is positively charged, but it is substantially shorter (13 residues; total charge +5) in comparison with Oxa1 (86 residues; +14), YidC1 (33 residues; +9), and YidC2 (61 residues; +14) (19Sääf A.

Recently, we have investigated the interaction of YidC with translation-stalled ribosomes by means of the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) technique under physiological condition using nanodisc-embedded YidC to mimic the native lipids environment (24Kedrov A. Sustarsic M. de Keyzer J. Caumanns J.J. Wu Z.C. Driessen A.J. Elucidating the native architecture of the YidC: ribosome complex.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 4112-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast to earlier models (25Kohler R. Boehringer D. Greber B. Bingel-Erlenmeyer R. Collinson I. Schaffitzel C. Ban N. YidC and Oxa1 form dimeric insertion pores on the translating ribosome.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 344-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we found that monomeric E. coli YidC was sufficient for ribosome binding, and thus it formed a minimal functional unit. The analysis highlighted the role of the C terminus of YidC in the ribosome binding but also suggested it to be not the sole determinant, so alternative ribosomal contacting sites were proposed within the positively charged C1 and C2 domains of YidC (25Kohler R. Boehringer D. Greber B. Bingel-Erlenmeyer R. Collinson I. Schaffitzel C. Ban N. YidC and Oxa1 form dimeric insertion pores on the translating ribosome.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 344-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The chimeric E. coli YidC with an extended C-terminal tail from Rhodopirellula baltica YidC (YidC-Rb) exhibited enhanced binding of translating ribosome forming primary interaction sites on the ribosomal rRNA helix 59 and the ribosomal protein L24, as shown by the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the YidC-Rb·RNC complex (26Seitl I. Wickles S. Beckmann R. Kuhn A. Kiefer D.

Microbiol. 2014; 91: 408-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Lately, Wickles et al. (27Wickles S. Singharoy A. Andreani J. Seemayer S. Bischoff L. Berninghausen O. Soeding J. Schulten K. van der Sluis E.O. Beckmann R. A structural model of the active ribosome-bound membrane protein insertase YidC.Elife. 2014; 3: e03035Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) built a structural model of E. coli YidC via the intramolecular co-variation analysis, which appeared in agreement with the experimentally solved structure. The model was applied to interpret the interaction of E. coli YidC with the RNC-F0c visualized in cryo-electron microscopy. The residues Tyr-370 and Tyr-377 in the C1 loop and Asp-488 in the C2 loop of YidC were suggested to be directly engaged in the ribosome binding at His-59 and the protein Leu-23, respectively (27Wickles S. Singharoy A. Andreani J. Seemayer S. Bischoff L. Berninghausen O. Soeding J. Schulten K. van der Sluis E.O. Beckmann R. A structural model of the active ribosome-bound membrane protein insertase YidC.Elife. 2014; 3: e03035Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Substitution of the residues compromised the vegetative growth of cells; however, the role of cytoplasmic loops in ribosome binding and insertion activity of YidC has not been studied. Here, we aimed to determine the regions of YidC involved in ribosome binding and further investigate the contribution of the YidC·ribosome physical interaction to the insertion process. Herein, we made sequential deletions within the C1 and C2 loops of E. coli YidC and studied their activity in vitro by means of biochemical and biophysical assays and also checked functional properties of these YidC variants in vivo. Truncations within loop C2 reduced ribosome binding to YidC at the membrane interface and combining deletions within C2 and at the C terminus of YidC also inactivated YidC in membrane insertion of F0c and MscL, suggesting that these two sites build a platform for ribosome docking. On the other hand, modifications within the loop C1 severely affected in vivo functioning of YidC but did not interfere with ribosome binding or substrate insertion, suggesting that the C1 loop is involved in chaperone/foldase activity of YidC or protein-protein interactions at the membrane interface or the insertion of yet unknown YidC substrates that are essential for cell viability. The YidC depletion strain E. coli FTL10 (28Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. A subset of bacterial inner membrane proteins integrated by the twin-arginine translocase.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Frank Sargent (University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK). E. coli SF100 (29Baneyx F. Georgiou G. In vivo degradation of secreted fusion proteins by the Escherichia coli outer membrane protease OmpT.J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 491-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to express the YidC variants. Plasmid pKA107 was used as the template, in which the endogenous cysteine residue at position 423 of YidC was substituted for a serine, whereas a solvent-exposed cysteine was introduced at position 269, which did not affect the functionality (24Kedrov A.

Primers were designed annealing to the flanking regions of the selected deletions in the cytosolic loops C1 and C2 of E. coli YidC (Table 1). PCR products containing truncated yidC genes were treated with DpnI at 37 °C for 2 h and then subject to gel purification. After phosphorylation and self-circularization, the resulting plasmids were multiplied in DH5α cells and verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids containing the genes encoding for YidC mutated proteins were subject to Eco88I (AvaI) and HindIII double digestion, and the obtained DNA fragments with truncated yidC genes were recloned into fresh pTrc99a, yielding plasmids pKA120–126 (Table 1). As for the mutated yidC gene containing deletions in the C2 domain and at the whole C terminus, PCR was carried out using plasmid pKA125 as the template. The resulting yidC double truncated gene was subject to XbaI and HindIII double digestion and cloned into XbaI/HindIII double-digested pTrc99a vector, yielding the construct pYP00.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in the studyPlasmid/strainDescriptionSourcePlasmidspTrc99aExpression vectorpKA107YidC(C423S, D269C)Ref. 24Kedrov A.

For aerobic growth, cells were grown overnight in the LB medium supplemented with 0.2% arabinose (w/v) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). To deplete YidC, overnight cultures were diluted into fresh LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose (w/v) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown at 37 °C for 3 h. After adjusting to the same A600, 10-fold dilution series of each culture were made and 3 μl of each dilution was spotted on LB plates in the presence of 0.2% arabinose (w/v) or 0.2% glucose (w/v) and 50 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The plates were incubated at 37 °C at least 10 h, and the growth phenotype of the diluted cultures displayed on LB plates supplemented with glucose and IPTG represents the deletion effect on YidC function. For the anaerobic growth, cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in the basal anaerobic medium containing K2HPO4 (0.7%), KH2PO4 (0.2%), NH4Cl (0.1%), MgSO4·7H2O (0.02%), CaCl2·2H2O (0.002%), SL9 trace element solutions (0.1% v/v) supplemented with the carbon source glycerol (0.5% v/v) and the electron acceptor sodium fumarate (10 mm), and 0.2% arabinose (w/v) was supplied initially to induce the expression of endogenous yidC gene. To deplete the endogenously expressed YidC, overnight cultures were collected and washed twice with basal anaerobic medium and were diluted 2-fold into the same medium supplemented with glycerol and sodium fumarate. The procedure was repeated until the growth cessation. The cells were subsequently serially diluted, and 3 μl of the cell suspension were spotted on anaerobic medium plates containing 0.2% arabinose (w/v) or 50 μm IPTG and 0.5% glucose, respectively. The anaerobic growth was carried out in sealed bottles under O2-free environment. Histidine-tagged YidC proteins or SecYEG were expressed into E. coli SF100, and the inner membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (24Kedrov A. Sustarsic M. de Keyzer J. Caumanns J.J.

Target proteins were purified by Ni+-NTA affinitychromatography. Firstly, inner membrane vesicles were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM), 100 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol at 4 °C for 30 min. As for YidC variants, 200 μm tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine was added to inhibit disulfide bonds formation. Then solubilized proteins were mixed with Ni+-NTA-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C on a rolling bank, washed with 3 bed volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% DDM, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 50 mm imidazole, and finally eluted with 300 mm imidazole in buffer A. For optional labeling, Ni+-NTA-bound YidC variants were incubated with the labeling buffer B (100 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 0.1% DDM, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 200 μm tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine) supplemented with 200 μm Alexa Fluor 488 C5-maleimide (Life Technologies/Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C on a rolling bank, followed by extensive washing with 10 mm imidazole and finally eluted by 400 mm imidazole in buffer B. Protein concentration and labeling efficiency were estimated spectrophotometrically. The extinction coefficient values for YidC at 280 nm and Alexa Fluor 488 at 500 nm were 96,000 and 72,000 cm−1 m−1, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1921005742,"Recent groundbreaking work has demonstrated that combined expression of the transcription factors Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1L (BAM; also known as Wernig factors) convert mouse fibroblasts into postmitotic neuronal cells. However, questions remain regarding whether trans-conversion is achieved directly or involves an intermediary precursor stage. Trans-conversion toward expandable neural precursor cells (NPCs) is more useful than direct one-step neuron formation with respect to yielding a sufficient number of cells and the feasibility of manipulating NPC differentiation toward certain neuron subtypes. Here, we show that co-expression of Wernig factors and Bcl-xL induces fibroblast conversion into NPCs (induced NPCs (iNPCs)) that are highly expandable for >100 passages. Gene expression analyses showed that the iNPCs exhibited high expression of common NPC genes but not genes specific to defined embryonic brain regions. This finding indicated that a regional identity of iNPCs was not established. Upon induction, iNPCs predominantly differentiated into astrocytes. However, the differentiation potential was not fixed and could be efficiently manipulated into general or specific subtypes of neurons by expression of additional genes. Specifically, overexpression of Nurr1 and Foxa2, transcription factors specific for midbrain dopamine neuron development, drove iNPCs to yield mature midbrain dopamine neurons equipped with presynaptic DA neuronal functions. We further assessed the therapeutic potential of iNPCs in Parkinson disease model rats.Background: Fibroblasts can be converted into neurons by transduction with BAM.Results: Multiple lines of evidence were used to demonstrate that a significant percentage of BAM-transduced fibroblasts can be converted into iNPCs by co-expression of Bcl-xL.Conclusion: BAMX-derived iNPCs were expandable over multiple passages in vitro, and differentiation phenotypes of iNPCs were readily manipulated by specific developmental cues.Significance: Bcl-xL has a critical role in neural precursor cell conversion.

Direct conversion from a somatic cell type into another tissue-specific cell without passing through a pluripotent state may circumvent the safety issues associated with using iPSCs. Wernig and colleagues (6Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Pang Z.P. Kokubu Y. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons by defined factors.Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar) provided the first evidence of such a direct conversion, in which expression of a combination of neuronal lineage-inducing transcription factors (Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1L (BAM); also known as Wernig factors) efficiently converted mesodermal mouse fibroblasts into induced neuronal cells. Direct conversion is a conceptually interesting process but is not very practical for research or therapy because direct 1:1 conversion can yield only a limited number of trans-converted cells. Furthermore, terminally differentiated cells are expected to integrate into and survive in host tissues poorly after transplantation compared with proliferating somatic precursor cells. Thus, conversion into expandable precursors is considered a better approach. Indeed, in the last several years, multiple protocols for the conversion of fibroblasts into neural precursor cells (NPCs) with self-renewal capacity have been developed using forced expression of diverse gene combinations (7Lujan E. Chanda S. Ahlenius H. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts to self-renewing, tripotent neural precursor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Protoc. 2014; 9: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Considering that somatic cells are generated sequentially via their intermediary tissue-specific precursors during in vivo development, direct trans-differentiation into another type of terminally differentiated cells is probably irrelevant from a physiological standpoint. Thus, an interesting but unanswered question is whether somatic cell conversions are induced under artificial conditions without passing through intermediate somatic precursor cell stages. To address this question, we utilized Wernig factor-based fibroblast-to-neuron conversion. Specifically, we utilized multiple lines of evidence to clearly demonstrate that a significant portion of BAM-transduced fibroblasts, if not all, can be converted into NPCs (referred as to induced NPCs (iNPCs)) by co-expression of BAM with Bcl-xL. Importantly, iNPCs exhibited a high capacity for self-renewal over a long period in culture as well as a propensity for easily manipulated differentiation. We further assessed the therapeutic potential of iNPCs in a Parkinson disease (PD) rat model. Animals were housed and treated according to the institutional animal care and use committee guidelines of Hanyang University. Fibroblasts from CF1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), ICR mice, C57/BL6 mice (DaeHan BioLink, Seoul, Korea), and pNestin-GFP mice were isolated from embryonic day 13.5 embryos (MEFs). Fibroblasts from Sprague-Dawley (DaeHan BioLink), Lewis, and Wistar rats (Central Lab. Animal Inc., Seoul, Korea) were isolated from embryos after removing the head, spinal cord, and all internal organs, including the gonads (REFs). Adult tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs) were kindly provided by Jeong Tae Do (Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea). Fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen).

Retroviral vectors were transfected into 293GPG packaging cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Supernatants containing viral particles were harvested 72 h after transfection. For generation of iNPCs, fibroblasts were seeded on gelatin-coated culture dishes (0.5–1 × 106 cells/100-cm dish). The next day, the cells were transduced with three retroviruses for BAM and additional factors as indicated. After 16–20 h, the culture medium was changed to fresh fibroblast medium containing 100 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). After 2 days, transduced cells were placed in neural induction medium (NIM; N2 medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 100 ng/ml FGF8, 100 units/ml recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; Millipore, Billerica, MA), and 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Dx; Sigma-Aldrich)), and the culture medium was changed every other day thereafter. Two days after initiating NIM culture conditions, cells were transferred to 6-well culture dishes precoated with 15 μg/ml poly-l-ornithine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μg/ml of fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) and maintained in NIM. After ∼2–3 weeks, the cell morphology changed to that of neural stem-like cells as evidenced by a small cell size and bipolar morphology. Formation of cell clusters was also observed. For generation of dopaminergic neurons, iNPCs were transferred onto coverslips (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ) precoated with poly-l-ornithine/fibronectin. After 1 day, iNPCs were transduced for 2 h with the dopaminergic neuron-related factors Nurr1 and Foxa2 as well as Ngn2 for mouse cells and were then cultured overnight in NIM and differentiated the following day in medium containing 0.2 mm ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (R&D Systems), 20 ng/ml glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (R&D Systems), and 250 μg/ml dibutyryl-cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich) in N2 medium. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRI REAGENT (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), and cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction volume using the Superscript kit (Invitrogen).

The bath solution consisted of 124 mm NaCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 3.2 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm NaHPO4, and 10 mm glucose saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The pipette (3–4-megaohm) solution for whole-cell patch clamp recordings consisted of 140 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm di-Tris-phosphocreatine, 5 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgATP, 0.4 mm Na2GTP, 15 mm HEPES, and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate at pH 7.3 (adjusted with KOH). pNestin-GFP MEF-derived iNPCs were analyzed and sorted using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Data were analyzed using Cell-Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences). For cell cycle analysis, BAMX-transduced iNPCs derived from MEFs or REFs were resuspended in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Invitrogen) and 250 μg/ml RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) was used for analysis, and cytometer readings were evaluated using the 488-nm emission filter. In vivo transplantation and histological procedures were performed as described previously (14He X.B. Yi S.H. Rhee Y.H. Kim H. Han Y.M. Lee S.H. Lee H. Park C.H. Lee Y.S. Richardson E. Kim B.W. Lee S.H. Prolonged membrane depolarization enhances midbrain dopamine neuron differentiation via epigenetic histone modifications.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 1861-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). iNPCs were deposited at two sites (coordinates in anterior/posterior, medial/lateral, and dorsal/ventral relative to the bregma and dura: 1) +0.07, −0.30, −0.55; 2) −0.1, −0.40, −0.50; incisor bar set at 3.5 mm below 0) while the animal was under anesthesia induced by Zoletil 50 (3.3 mg/kg; Virbac Laboratories, Carros, France) mixed with Rompun (93.3 μg/kg; Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea). The needle was left in place for 5 min following each injection. Amphetamine-induced rotations were determined 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks after transplantation. Three and 8 weeks after transplantation, animals were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde. To compensate for double counting in adjacent sections, we used the Abercrombie correction factor (N = n × T/(T + D), where N is the actual number of cells, n is the number of nuclear profiles, T is the section thickness, and D is the average diameter of nuclei). Graft areas were determined using Leica Application Suite image analysis, and the Cavalieri estimator was used to calculate graft volumes. Free-floating 30-μm sections were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry using DAB staining. Sections were washed in 0.1% BSA/PBS and then incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1% BSA/PBS for 1 h and incubated overnight with primary antibody (TH 1:250; Pel-Freez) at 4 °C in 0.1% BSA/PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. After rinsing, sections were incubated with a biotinylated antibody (1:250; Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. After washing, the sections were incubated in horseradish peroxidase streptavidin (1:400; Vector Laboratories) for 2 h. The sections were then washed and visualized using DAB tetrahydrochloride (SK-4100; Vector Laboratories) for 10–30 s. Development was quenched with distilled water, and each section was mounted on a slide, air-dried, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images from stained sections were collected with a Leica fluorescent microscope equipped with an F-View II camera. Dopamine (DA) levels were determined using a dopamine research ELISA kit (Labor Diagnostika Nord, Nordhorn, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the amount of DA released from differentiated cells with or without Nurr1 and Foxa2 transduction, N2 + ascorbic acid medium, conditioned in cells for 48 h, was collected. DA release evoked by depolarization was also observed in differentiated cells. Cells at terminal differentiation on day 15 were incubated in N2 + ascorbic acid with (evoked) or without (basal release) 56 mm KCl for 30 min, and the medium was collected. Collected medium was stabilized with 4 mm sodium metabisulfite containing 1 mm EDTA, and DA levels were calculated using a standard curve obtained by plotting the absorbance readings based on standards (linear, y axis) against the corresponding standard concentrations (logarithmic, x axis). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression was measured using a MouseWG-6 BeadChip kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Raw data were imported into Illumina GenomeStudio software, and intensities were normalized using the cubic spline method. We selected only genes that exhibited significant levels of detection (p < 0.01) and a -fold change of ≥2 compared with day 0 at one or more time points after initiation of direct conversion. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using log ratio-transformed expression data of selected genes with the complete linkage method and correlation distance, which was estimated from the cluster algorithm. The clustering result was visualized using TreeView (15Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Cluster analysis and display of genome-wide expression patterns.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13199) Google Scholar). Cell counting was performed with uniform random selection of 5–10 microscopic fields/well and 3–4 wells/experimental condition. All values were confirmed in at least three independent experiments. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. A paired t test was performed when more than two groups were compared. Analyses were performed with SigmaPlot for Windows, version 10.0 (Systat Software GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). Previous studies have shown that fibroblasts transduced with a combination of neurogenic factors, including BAM, are directly converted into terminally differentiated neuronal cells. However, it remains to be determined whether fibroblast-to-neuron conversion is attained without passing through an intermediary stage for NPCs. To address this question, we isolated fibroblasts from transgenic mouse embryos expressing GFP under promoter control by nestin, an intermediate filament specific for NPCs (pNestin-GFP). Fibroblasts were cultured using the BAM-based trans-conversion protocol schematized in Fig. 1A. A fibroblast phenotype was confirmed by the expression of collagen I (COL1) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Fig. 1, Bi and Bii). None of the in vitro pNestin-GFP fibroblasts at day in vitro (DIV) 0 were positive for GFP (Fig. 1B), nestin, or SOX2 (Fig. 1, Biii and Biv), indicating that there was no neural tissue contamination during fibroblast preparation. After growing in culture for 1–2 weeks, the BAM-transduced fibroblasts were transformed into small (cell body size: 10–20 μm) and slender cells with fine fiber outgrowths (usually bipolar; Fig. 1, C and D), which are characteristic features of neural lineage cells. Interestingly, GFP+ cells (3.24 ± 2.42% of the total number of cells at DIV 10 (Fig. 1, C and E) appeared along with cells expressing the neuron-specific class III β-tubulin (TUJ1) in a mutually exclusive manner (Fig. 1Di). The percentage of GFP+ cells increased to 13.12 ± 7.69% at DIV 20 (Fig. 1, D and E). In addition, nestin and SOX2 were co-localized in GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 1, Dii and Diii), confirming the NPC identity of the GFP+ cells. Together, these findings suggested that BAM-transduced fibroblasts gave rise to not only neurons but also NPCs, and thus BAM transduction can be used as a strategy for fibroblast-to-NPC conversion. To improve the NPC conversion efficiency, we tested co-expression of BAM with several other factors associated with NPC survival, proliferation, fate, and identity. Among the various factors tested, Bcl-xL, which is expressed in NPCs during brain development and is associated with survival and neuronal differentiation of NPCs (12Chang M.Y. Sun W. Ochiai W.

Microarray analysis showed that the global gene expression pattern of fibroblasts transduced with BAM + Bcl-xL (BAMX) gradually transformed into one similar to that of NPCs derived from a mouse embryonic cortex after 2 weeks in culture (Fig. 1G). To obtain a uniform population of NPCs (hereafter referred to as “iNPCs”), we performed FACS-based sorting using GFP expression on BAMX-transduced pNestin-GFP cells at DIV 20. After sorting, the GFP+ iNPC population reached >95% of total cells (Fig. 1H). Bcl-xL has been reported to exert its anti-apoptotic effects through dimerization and mitochondrial localization. The percentage of nestin+ or SOX2+ cells in BAM-transduced cultures was similarly enhanced by co-expression of the Bcl-xL mutants in which the site for dimerization (Y101K) or mitochondrial localization (R209X) is abolished (Fig. 2A), with slightly lower efficiency than that of Bcl-xL wild type (Fig. 2, B–D). However, in our close examination, nestin and SOX2 immunoreactivities were not well co-localized in the mutant-expressing cultures, and thus the percentage of cells co-expressing nestin and SOX2 was much lower in the cultures cotransduced with the Bcl-xL mutants than that of the wild type; the percentages of nestin+SOX2+ cells of total SOX2+ cells were as follows: 76.53 ± 7.28% (BAM + Bcl-xL wild type), 11.14 ± 2.28% (BAM + Bcl-xL Y101K mutant), and 13.46 ± 7.01% (BAM + Bcl-xL R209X mutant) (Fig. 2, B and E). These findings suggest that anti-apoptotic action and/or actions of Bcl-xL mediated by the dimerization and mitochondrial co-localization contribute at least in part to facilitating BAM-induced iNPC generation. We and others recently reported that Dx exerts a protective effect in pluripotent cells and neural cells at various stages of development (20Chang M.Y. Rhee Y.H. Yi S.H. Lee S.J."
https://openalex.org/W2153772612,"In coastal China, there is an urgent need to increase land area for agricultural production and urban development, where there is a rapid growing population. One solution is land reclamation from coastal tidelands, but soil salinization is problematic. As such, it is very important to characterize and map the within-field variability of soil salinity in space and time. Conventional methods are often time-consuming, expensive, labor-intensive, and unpractical. Fortunately, proximal sensing has become an important technology in characterizing within-field spatial variability. In this study, we employed the EM38 to study spatial variability of soil salinity in a coastal paddy field. Significant correlation relationship between ECa and EC1:5 (i.e. r >0.9) allowed us to use EM38 data to characterize the spatial variability of soil salinity. Geostatistical methods were used to determine the horizontal spatio-temporal variability of soil salinity over three consecutive years. The study found that the distribution of salinity was heterogeneous and the leaching of salts was more significant in the edges of the study field. By inverting the EM38 data using a Quasi-3D inversion algorithm, the vertical spatio-temporal variability of soil salinity was determined and the leaching of salts over time was easily identified. The methodology of this study can be used as guidance for researchers interested in understanding soil salinity development as well as land managers aiming for effective soil salinity monitoring and management practices. In order to better characterize the variations in soil salinity to a deeper soil profile, the deeper mode of EM38 (i.e., EM38v) as well as other EMI instruments (e.g. DUALEM-421) can be incorporated to conduct Quasi-3D inversions for deeper soil profiles."

Disruption of the anxA4 gene led to a consistent increase in intracellular cAMP levels in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes, with heart-directed expression of the EPAC-FRET sensor, stimulated with FSK, and as determined by ELISA, also in mouse cardiomyocytes stimulated with the β-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) (anxA4a(+/+) vs. anxA4a(-/-): 5.1 ± 0.3 vs. 6.7 ± 0.6 fmol/µg protein) or FSK (anxA4a(+/+) vs. anxA4a(-/-): 1891 ± 238 vs. 2796 ± 343 fmol/µg protein; n = 9-10). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells revealed a direct interaction of murine AnxA4 with human membrane-bound AC type 5 (AC5). As a functional consequence of AnxA4-mediated AC inhibition, AnxA4 inhibited the FSK-induced transcriptional activation mediated by the cAMP response element (CRE) in reporter gene studies (10-fold vs. control; n = 4 transfections) and reduced the FSK-induced phosphorylation of the CRE-binding protein (CREB) measured on Western blots (control vs. +AnxA4: 150 ± 17% vs. 105 ± 10%; n = 6) and by the use of the indicator of CREB activation caused by phosphorylation (ICAP)-FRET sensor, indicating CREB phosphorylation. Inactivation of AnxA4 in anxA4a(-/-) mice was associated with an increased cardiac response to β-AR stimulation. Together, these results suggest that AnxA4 is a novel direct negative regulator of AC5, adding a new facet to the functions of annexins."

https://openalex.org/W386036485,"α-Amylase, a major pancreatic protein and starch hydrolase, is essential for energy acquisition. Mammalian pancreatic α-amylase binds specifically to glycoprotein N-glycans in the brush-border membrane to activate starch digestion, whereas it significantly inhibits glucose uptake by Na+/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) at high concentrations (Asanuma-Date, K., Hirano, Y., Le, N., Sano, K., Kawasaki, N., Hashii, N., Hiruta, Y., Nakayama, K., Umemura, M., Ishikawa, K., Sakagami, H., and Ogawa, H. (2012) Functional regulation of sugar assimilation by N-glycan-specific interaction of pancreatic α-amylase with glycoproteins of duodenal brush border membrane. J. Biol. Chem. 287, 23104–23118). However, how the inhibition is stopped was unknown. Here, we show a new mechanism for the regulation of intestinal glucose absorption. Immunohistochemistry revealed that α-amylase in the duodena of non-fasted, but not fasted, pigs was internalized from the pancreatic fluid and immunostained. We demonstrated that after N-glycan binding, pancreatic α-amylase underwent internalization into lysosomes in a process that was inhibited by α-mannoside. The internalized α-amylase was degraded, showing low enzymatic activity and molecular weight at the basolateral membrane. In a human intestinal Caco-2 cell line, Alexa Fluor 488-labeled pancreatic α-amylase bound to the cytomembrane was transported to lysosomes through the endocytic pathway and then disappeared, suggesting degradation. Our findings indicate that N-glycan recognition by α-amylase protects enterocytes against a sudden increase in glucose concentration and restores glucose uptake by gradual internalization, which homeostatically controls the postprandial blood glucose level. The internalization of α-amylase may also enhance the supply of amino acids required for the high turnover of small intestine epithelial cells. This study provides novel and significant insights into the control of blood sugar during the absorption stage in the intestine. Background: Secreted pancreatic α-amylase binds to N-glycans of the duodenal brush-border membrane (BBM) and inhibits glucose uptake by SGLT1 at high doses. Results: Enterocytes endocytosed and degraded the α-amylase in lysosomes about 30 min after BBM binding. Conclusion: N-Glycan recognition and subsequent internalization of α-amylase suppressed and then gradually allowed duodenal glucose absorption. Significance: A newly revealed mechanism regulates postprandial intestinal glucose uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1623540772,"Recent studies have suggested that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) increases macrophage phagocytosis through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, little information is available on the effects of AICAR on the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, known as efferocytosis, which is essential in maintaining tissue homeostasis and resolving inflammation. AICAR increased p38 MAPK activation and the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages, which were inhibited by the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, the TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) inhibitor, (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol, and siRNA-mediated knock-down of p38α. AICAR increased phosphorylation of Akt, but the inhibition of PI3K/Akt activity using LY294002 did not affect the AICAR-induced changes in efferocytosis in macrophages. CGS15943, a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, did not affect AICAR-induced changes in efferocytosis, but dipyridamole, an adenosine transporter inhibitor, diminished the AICAR-mediated increases in efferocytosis. AICAR-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation was not inhibited by the AMPK inhibitor, compound C, or siRNA-mediated knock-down of AMPKα1. Inhibition of AMPK using compound C or 5'-iodotubercidin did not completely block AICAR-mediated increases in efferocytosis. Furthermore, AICAR also increased the removal of apoptotic neutrophils or thymocytes in mouse lungs. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which AICAR increases macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and suggest that AICAR may be used to treat efferocytosis-related inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W361334482,"The Thailand flood crisis in 2011 was one of the largest recorded floods in modern history, causing enormous damage to the economy and ecological habitats of the country. In this study, bacterial and fungal diversity in sediments and waters collected from ten flood areas in Bangkok and its suburbs, covering residential and agricultural areas, were analyzed using high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer sequences. Analysis of microbial community showed differences in taxa distribution in water and sediment with variations in the diversity of saprophytic microbes and sulfate/nitrate reducers among sampling locations, suggesting differences in microbial activity in the habitats. Overall, Proteobacteria represented a major bacterial group in waters, while this group co-existed with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria in sediments. Anaeromyxobacter, Steroidobacter, and Geobacter were the dominant bacterial genera in sediments, while Sulfuricurvum, Thiovirga, and Hydrogenophaga predominated in waters. For fungi in sediments, Ascomycota, Glomeromycota, and Basidiomycota, particularly in genera Philipsia, Rozella, and Acaulospora, were most frequently detected. Chytridiomycota and Ascomycota were the major fungal phyla, and Rhizophlyctis and Mortierella were the most frequently detected fungal genera in water. Diversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria, related to odor problems, was further investigated using analysis of the dsrB gene which indicated the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria of families Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae, Syntrobacteraceae, and Desulfoarculaceae in the flood sediments. The work provides an insight into the diversity and function of microbes related to biological processes in flood areas."

Over 70% of incident cases and deaths occur in developing countries. We explored whether disparities in access to improved drinking water sources were associated with GC risk in the Golestan Gastric Cancer Case Control Study.306 cases and 605 controls were matched on age, gender, and place of residence. We conducted unconditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education, head of household education, place of birth and residence, homeownership, home size, wealth score, vegetable consumption, and H. pylori seropositivity. Fully-adjusted ORs were 0.23 (95% CI: 0.05-1.04) for chlorinated well water, 4.58 (95% CI: 2.07-10.16) for unchlorinated well water, 4.26 (95% CI: 1.81-10.04) for surface water, 1.11 (95% CI: 0.61-2.03) for water from cisterns, and 1.79 (95% CI: 1.20-2.69) for all unpiped sources, compared to in-home piped water. Comparing unchlorinated water to chlorinated water, we found over a two-fold increased GC risk (OR 2.37, 95% CI: 1.56-3.61).Unpiped and unchlorinated drinking water sources, particularly wells and surface water, were significantly associated with the risk of GC."
https://openalex.org/W1889997776,"Rainfall and temperature are the primary limiting factors for optimum quality and yield of cultivated jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.). Adaptation to arid and cool environments has been and remains an important goal of many jujube improvement programs. This study summarized the survey results of 116 Chinese jujube varieties grown at 33 sites in China. The objective was to identify the environmental factors that influence leaf morphology, and the implications for breeding and introduction of new jujube varieties. Jujube leaf morphological traits were evaluated for their potential relationships with mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP). The results showed that many leaf morphological traits had a strong linear relationship with local precipitation and temperature. Longer veins per unit area (VLA) and reduced leaf area and leaf perimeter were typical of arid areas. VLA was inversely related to MAT and MAP at the centers of origin of jujube. There was a positive relationship between leaf shape (perimeter2/area) and both MAT and MAP. These results indicated that leaf vein traits of Chinese jujubes might have resulted from their adaptation to environmental factors in the course of long-term evolution. Principal component analysis allocated the 116 jujube varieties to three different groups, differentiated on the basis of morphological and physiological leaf characteristics. Jujube varieties from the Hebei, Shandong, Henan, southern Shanxi and central Shaanxi provinces were closely related, as were varieties from northwest Shanxi and northeast Shaanxi provinces, and varieties from the Gansu and Ningxia provinces. These close relationships were partially attributed to the frequent exchanges of varieties within each group. Leaf venation characteristics might be used as reference indices for jujube variety introduction between different locations."
https://openalex.org/W609666879,"Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (hUC-MSCs) are currently being used as novel therapeutic agents in numerous clinical trials. Previous works have shown that hUC-MSCs possess profound immunomodulatory capacities through IL-1 stimulation produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), their main cellular partner in most pathophysiological and therapeutic situations. The present study was designed to explore the role of TNF-α in these interactions. In these experiments, we demonstrated that TNF-α originated from PBMCs under the influence of IL-1. We also showed that TNF-α acted differently depending upon the concentrations reached. At low concentrations it clearly contributed to IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) production. At high concentrations, used alone or in association with the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, TNF-α also stimulated hUC-MSC IL-6 but, more intensely, MCP-1 production. This stimulation was associated but independent of apoptosis induction in a process involving Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tested to stimulate PBMC and tissue activation, amplified IL-6 and MCP-1 production and cell death by, apparently, a different process involving necrosis. Our findings bring new insights into the complex interactions between hUC-MSCs and PBMCs, involving cytokines, chemokines and cell death, and are of fundamental importance for tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W903907309,"Aims Interval cancer is a key factor that influences the effectiveness of a cancer screening program. To evaluate the impact of interval cancer on the effectiveness of endoscopic screening, the survival rates of patients with interval cancer were analyzed. Methods We performed gastric cancer-specific and all-causes survival analyses of patients with screen-detected cancer and patients with interval cancer in the endoscopic screening group and radiographic screening group using the Kaplan-Meier method. Since the screening interval was 1 year, interval cancer was defined as gastric cancer detected within 1 year after a negative result. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate the risk factors associated with gastric cancer-specific and all-causes death. Results A total of 1,493 gastric cancer patients (endoscopic screening group: n = 347; radiographic screening group: n = 166; outpatient group: n = 980) were identified from the Tottori Cancer Registry from 2001 to 2008. The gastric cancer-specific survival rates were higher in the endoscopic screening group than in the radiographic screening group and the outpatients group. In the endoscopic screening group, the gastric cancer-specific survival rate of the patients with screen-detected cancer and the patients with interval cancer were nearly equal (P = 0.869). In the radiographic screening group, the gastric cancer-specific survival rate of the patients with screen-detected cancer was higher than that of the patients with interval cancer (P = 0.009). For gastric cancer-specific death, the hazard ratio of interval cancer in the endoscopic screening group was 0.216 for gastric cancer death (95%CI: 0.054-0.868) compared with the outpatient group. Conclusion The survival rate and the risk of gastric cancer death among the patients with screen-detected cancer and patients with interval cancer were not significantly different in the annual endoscopic screening. These results suggest the potential of endoscopic screening in reducing mortality from gastric cancer."

Our aim was to explore perceptions of staff of an Indian rural tertiary care teaching hospital on hospital waste management.A qualitative study was conducted using 10 focus group discussions (FGDs), with different professional groups, cleaning staff, nurses, medical students, doctors and administrators. The FGD guide included the following topics: (i) role of Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) in prevention of health care associated infections, (ii) awareness of and views about HCWM-related guidelines/legislation, (iii) current HCWM practices, (iv) perception and preparedness related to improvements of the current practices, and (v) proper implementation of the available guidelines/legislation. The FGDs were recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated to English (when conducted in Hindi) and analysed using content analysis.Two themes were identified: Theme (A), 'Challenges in integration of HCWM in organizational practice,' with the categories (I) Awareness and views about HCWM, (II) Organizational practices regarding HCWM, and (III) Challenges in Implementation of HCWM; and Theme (B), 'Interventions to improve HCWM,' with three categories, (I) Educational and motivational interventions, (II) Organizational culture change, and (III) Policy-related interventions.A gap between knowledge and actual practice regarding HCWM was highlighted in the perception of the hospital staff. The participants suggested organizational changes, training and monitoring to address this.

The contribution of MSU to anti-mycobacterial activity was also shown in vivo. Mice vaccinated in the presence of MSU showed a lower number of BCG in lymph nodes draining the vaccine inoculation site, in comparison to mice vaccinated without MSU. Lastly, we showed that MSU improved the efficacy of BCG vaccination in mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), measured in terms of lung and spleen MTB burden. These results demonstrate that the use of MSU as adjuvant may represent a novel strategy to enhance the efficacy of BCG vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W1608448823,"β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) agonists (β2-agonist) are the most commonly used therapy for acute relief in asthma, but chronic use of these bronchodilators paradoxically exacerbates airway hyper-responsiveness. Activation of βARs by β-agonist leads to desensitization (inactivation) by phosphorylation through G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) which mediate β-arrestin binding and βAR internalization. Resensitization occurs by dephosphorylation of the endosomal βARs which recycle back to the plasma membrane as agonist-ready receptors. To determine whether the loss in β-agonist response in asthma is due to altered βAR desensitization and/or resensitization, we used primary human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) isolated from the lungs of non-asthmatic and fatal-asthmatic subjects. Asthmatic HASMCs have diminished adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP response to β-agonist as compared to non-asthmatic HASMCs. Confocal microscopy showed significant accumulation of phosphorylated β2ARs in asthmatic HASMCs. Systematic analysis of desensitization components including GRKs and β-arrestin showed no appreciable differences between asthmatic and non-asthmatic HASMCs. However, asthmatic HASMC showed significant increase in PI3Kγ activity and was associated with reduction in PP2A activity. Since reduction in PP2A activity could alter receptor resensitization, endosomal fractions were isolated to assess the agonist ready β2ARs as a measure of resensitization. Despite significant accumulation of β2ARs in the endosomes of asthmatic HASMCs, endosomal β2ARs cannot robustly activate adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, endosomes from asthmatic HASMCs are associated with significant increase in PI3Kγ and reduced PP2A activity that inhibits β2AR resensitization. Our study shows that resensitization, a process considered to be a homeostasis maintaining passive process is inhibited in asthmatic HASMCs contributing to β2AR dysfunction which may underlie asthma pathophysiology and loss in asthma control."

ALS, a neuromuscular disease, causes progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Objective We analyzed the spinal cords of G93A mice following dietary D3 restriction at 2.5% the adequate intake (AI) for oxidative damage (4-HNE, 3-NY), antioxidant enzymes (SOD2, catalase, GPx1), inflammation (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10), apoptosis (bax/bcl-2 ratio, cleaved/pro-caspase 3 ratio), neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neuron count (ChAT, SMI-36/SMI-32 ratio). Methods Beginning at age 25 d, 42 G93A mice were provided food ad libitum with either adequate (AI;1 IU D3/g feed; 12 M, 11 F) or deficient (DEF; 0.025 IU D3/g feed; 10 M, 9 F) D3. At age 113 d, the spinal cords were analyzed for protein content. Differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0.10, since this was a pilot study. Results DEF mice had 16% higher 4-HNE (P = 0.056), 12% higher GPx1 (P = 0.057) and 23% higher Bax/Bcl2 ratio (P = 0.076) vs. AI. DEF females had 29% higher GPx1 (P = 0.001) and 22% higher IL-6 (P = 0.077) vs. AI females. DEF males had 23% higher 4-HNE (P = 0.066) and 18% lower SOD2 (P = 0.034) vs. AI males. DEF males had 27% lower SOD2 (P = 0.004), 17% lower GPx1 (P = 0.070), 29% lower IL-6 (P = 0.023) and 22% lower ChAT (P = 0.082) vs. DEF females.

https://openalex.org/W414738568,"Understanding of standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) depends on the background accumulations of glucose because the SUV often varies the status of patients. The purpose of this study was to develop a new method for quantitative analysis of SUV of FDG-PET scan images. The method included an anatomical standardization and a statistical comparison with normal cases by using Z-score that are often used in SPM or 3D-SSP approach for brain function analysis. Our scheme consisted of two approaches, which included the construction of a normal model and the determination of the SUV scores as Z-score index for measuring the abnormality of an FDG-PET scan image. To construct the normal torso model, all of the normal images were registered into one shape, which indicated the normal range of SUV at all voxels. The image deformation process consisted of a whole body rigid registration of shoulder to bladder region and liver registration and a non-linear registration of body surface by using the thin-plate spline technique. In order to validate usefulness of our method, we segment suspicious regions on FDG-PET images manually, and obtained the Z-scores of the regions based on the corresponding voxels that stores the mean and the standard deviations from the normal model. We collected 243 (143 males and 100 females) normal cases to construct the normal model. We also extracted 432 abnormal spots from 63 abnormal cases (73 cancer lesions) to validate the Z-scores. The Z-scores of 417 out of 432 abnormal spots were higher than 2.0, which statistically indicated the severity of the spots. In conclusions, the Z-scores obtained by our computerized scheme with anatomical standardization of torso region would be useful for visualization and detection of subtle lesions on FDG-PET scan images even when the SUV may not clearly show an abnormality."

Validated questionnaire was used to collect dietary data. Cluster analysis was run separately for all participants, plausible energy reporters (PER), and energy under-reporters (EUR) to define dietary patterns.Three clusters, ""healthy"", ""mixed"" and ""western"", were identified for both surveys. The ""mixed"" cluster was the predominant cluster in both surveys. Excluding EUR reduced the proportion of the ""mixed"" cluster up to 6.40% in the 2000 survey; this caused secular trend increase in the prevalence of the ""mixed"" pattern. Cross-classification analysis of all participants and PER' data showed substantial agreement in cluster assignments: 68.7% in 2000 and 84.4% in 2005. Excluding EUR did not cause meaningful (≥ 15%) changes in the ""healthy"" pattern. It provoked changes in consumption of some food groups in the ""mixed"" and ""western"" patterns: mainly decreases of unhealthy foods within the 2000 and increases of unhealthy foods within the 2005 surveys. Secular trend effects of EUR were similar to those within the 2005 survey. Excluding EUR reversed the direction of secular trends in consumption of several food groups in PER in the ""mixed"" and ""western"" patterns.EUR affected distribution of participants between dietary patterns within and between surveys, secular trends in food group consumption and amount of food consumed in all, but not in the ""healthy"" pattern.

The pH value of surface water sample was found to be in the range of 6.83 to 9.31, and the average concentrations of NH4(+)-N, chemical oxygen demand (COD), volatile phenol and total phosphorus (TP) were found decreasing significantly. The water quality of the river has been improved from 2009 to 2010. Through the calculation of the data availability and the correlation between adjacent sections, it was found that the present monitoring network was inefficient as well as the optimization was indispensable. In order to improve the situation, the matter element analysis and gravity distance were applied in the optimization of river monitoring network, which were proved to be a useful method to optimize river quality monitoring network. The amount of monitoring sections were cut from 17 to 13 for the monitoring network was more cost-effective after being optimized.

There is a critical need for improved diagnostics for children. Thus, we sought to evaluate the performance of a technique that measures antibodies in lymphocyte supernatant (ALS) for the diagnosis of TB in severely malnourished children presenting with suspected pneumonia.Children less than 5 years with severe acute malnutrition and radiological features of pneumonia admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, were enrolled consecutively following informed written consent. In addition to clinical and radiological assessment, samples taken for TB diagnosis included gastric lavage fluid and induced sputum for microbiological confirmation. ALS was measured from venous blood, and results were evaluated in children classified as ""confirmed"", ""non-confirmed TB"" or ""not TB"".Among 224 children who had ALS analysis, 12 (5.4%) children had microbiologically ""confirmed TB"", a further 41 (18%) had clinically diagnosed ""non-confirmed TB"" and the remaining 168 (75%) were considered not to have TB. ALS was positive in 89 (40%) and negative in 85 (39%) of children, with a large number (47 or 21%) reported as ""borderline"". These proportions were similar between the three diagnostic groups. The sensitivity and specificity of ALS when comparing ""Confirmed TB"" to ""Not TB"" was only 67% (95% CI: 31-91%) and 51% (95% CI: 42-60%), respectively.Our data suggest that ALS is not sufficiently accurate to improve the diagnosis of TB in children with severe malnutrition."

https://openalex.org/W421615445,"The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the semen quality traits of purebred male rabbits and their crosses under subtropical Egyptian conditions. A full 3 x 3 diallel crossing was performed for producing the first generation progeny of New Zealand White (N), Flander (F) and Rex (R) breeds. The highest ejaculate volume (p< 0.05) and percentage of live sperms (p<0.01) with the lowest percentage of sperm cell morphological abnormalities (p<0.05) had been recorded in the NF bucks. Moreover, they possessed positive estimates of direct heterosis for ejaculate volume, mass motility (Mm), individual motility (Im) and sperm cell concentration (SCC). On the contrary, pH had negative estimates of direct heterosis in all crosses and their reciprocal. Semen pH was negatively correlated with SCC (r = -0.18), Mm (r = -0.13) and Im (r = -0.23). In conclusion, the superiority of crossbreeding was particularly obvious in the New Zealand White x Flander males, which cumulated heterosis and favorable maternal effects of the Flander dams."
https://openalex.org/W2261688763,"Some studies have shown that manual asymmetries decrease in older age. These results have often been explained with reference to models of reduced hemispheric specialisation. An alternative explanation, however, is that hand differences are subtle, and capturing them requires tasks that yield optimal performance with both hands. Whereas the hemispheric specialisation account implies that reduced manual asymmetries should be reliably observed in older adults, the 'measurement difficulty' account suggests that manual asymmetries will be hard to detect unless a task has just the right level of difficulty--i.e. within the 'Goldilocks Zone', where it is not too easy or too hard, but just right. Experiment One tested this hypothesis and found that manual asymmetries were only detected when participants performed in this zone; specifically, performance on a tracing task was only superior in the preferred hand when task constraints were high (i.e. fast speed tracing). Experiment Two used three different tasks to examine age differences in manual asymmetries; one task produced no asymmetries, whilst two tasks revealed asymmetries in both younger and older groups (with poorer overall performance in the old group across all tasks). Experiment Three revealed task-dependent asymmetries in both age groups, but highlighted further detection difficulties linked with the metric of performance and compensatory strategies used by participants. Results are discussed with reference to structural learning theory, whereby we suggest that the processes of inter-manual transfer lead to relatively small performance differences between the hands (despite a strong phenomenological sense of performance disparities)."
https://openalex.org/W1773579530,"An EBV-specific cellular immune response is associated with the control of EBV-associated malignancies and lymphoproliferative diseases, some of which have been successfully treated by adoptive T cell therapy. Therefore, many methods have been used to measure EBV-specific cellular immune responses. Previous studies have mainly used autologous EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCLs), recombinant viral vectors transfected or peptide pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) as stimulators of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T lymphocytes. In the present study, we used an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay by using isolated CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells stimulated with mRNA-transfected DCs. The frequency of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)-specific IFN-γ producing CD4(+) T cells was significantly higher than that of LMP2a. The frequency of IFN-γ producing CD4(+) T cells was significantly correlated with that of CD8(+) T cells in LMP1-specific immune responses (r = 0.7187, Pc < 0.0001). To determine whether there were changes in LMP1- or LMP2a-specific immune responses, subsequent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) samples were analyzed. Significant changes were observed in 5 of the 10 donors examined, and CD4(+) T cell responses showed more significant changes than CD8(+) T cell responses. CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells from EBV-seropositive donors secreted only the Th1 cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, while Th2 (IL-4) and Th17 (IL-17a) cytokines were not detected. CD4(+) T cells secreted significantly higher cytokine levels than did CD8(+) T cells. Analysis of EBV-specific T cell responses using autologous DCs transfected with mRNA might provide a comprehensive tool for monitoring EBV infection and new insights into the pathogenesis of EBV-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W582727873,"The PrePex is a WHO--prequalified medical device for adult male circumcision for HIV prevention. The Government of Rwanda was the first country to implement the PrePex device and acts as the leading center of excellence providing training and formal guidelines. As part of the Government's efforts to improve PrePex implementation, it made efforts to improve the psychological acceptability of device by men, thus increasing uptake with VMMC in sub-Saharan Africa. Some men who underwent the PrePex procedure complained of foreskin odor while wearing the PrePex 3-7 days after it was placed. This complaint was identified as potential risk for uptake of the device. Researchers from Rwanda assumed there is a possible relation between the level of foreskin odor and patient foreskin hygiene technique. The Government of Rwanda decided to investigate those assumptions in a scientific way and conduct a trial to test different hygiene-cleaning methods in order to increase the acceptability of PrePex and mitigate the odor concern. The main objective of the trial was to compare odor levels between three arms, having identical personal hygiene but different foreskin hygiene techniques using either clear water with soap during a daily shower, soapy water using a syringe, or chlorhexidine using a syringe. One hundred and one subjects were enrolled to the trial and randomly allocated into three trial arms. Using chlorhexidine solution daily almost completely eliminated odor, and was statistically significant more effective that the other two arms. The trial results suggest that odor from the foreskin, while wearing the PrePex device, could be related to the growth of anaerobic bacteria, which can be prevented by a chlorhexidine cleaning method. This finding can be used to increase acceptability by men when considering PrePex as one of the leading methods for HIV prevention in VMMC programs."
https://openalex.org/W814087380,"The glycoprotein-gene (G gene) -deleted rabies virus (RV) vector is a powerful tool to examine the function and structure of neural circuits. We previously reported that the deletion of the G gene enhances the transgene expression level of the RV vector. However, the mechanism of this enhancement remains to be clarified. We presume that there are two possible factors for this enhancement. The first factor is the glycoprotein of RV, which shows cytotoxicity; thus, may cause a dysfunction in the translation process of infected cells. The second possible factor is the enhanced expression of the L gene, which encodes viral RNA polymerase. In the RV, it is known that the gene expression level is altered depending on the position of the gene. Since G-gene deletion displaces the L gene in the genome, the expression of the L gene and viral transcription may be enhanced. In this study, we compared the transgene expression level and viral transcription of three recombinant RV vectors. The effect of glycoprotein was examined by comparing the viral gene expression of G-gene-intact RV and G-gene-replaced RV. Despite the fact that the L-gene transcription level of these two RV vectors was similar, the G-gene-replaced RV vector showed higher viral transcription and transgene expression level than the G-gene-intact RV vector. To examine the effect of the position of the L gene, we compared the viral gene expression of the G-gene-deleted RV and G-gene-replaced RV. The G-gene-deleted RV vector showed higher L-gene transcription, viral transcription, and transgene expression level than the G-gene-replaced RV vector. These results indicate that G-gene deletion enhances the transgene expression level through at least two factors, the absence of glycoprotein and enhancement of L-gene expression. These findings enable investigators to design a useful viral vector that shows a controlled desirable transgene expression level in applications."
