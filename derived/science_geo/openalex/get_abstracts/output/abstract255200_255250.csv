https://openalex.org/W2142300779,"The role of the adaptive immune response in controlling the growth and recurrence of human tumors has been controversial. We characterized the tumor-infiltrating immune cells in large cohorts of human colorectal cancers by gene expression profiling and in situ immunohistochemical staining. Collectively, the immunological data (the type, density, and location of immune cells within the tumor samples) were found to be a better predictor of patient survival than the histopathological methods currently used to stage colorectal cancer. The results were validated in two additional patient populations. These data support the hypothesis that the adaptive immune response influences the behavior of human tumors. In situ analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells may therefore be a valuable prognostic tool in the treatment of colorectal cancer and possibly other malignancies."

We demonstrate that this “Connectivity Map” resource can be used to find connections among small molecules sharing a mechanism of action, chemicals and physiological processes, and diseases and drugs. These results indicate the feasibility of the approach and suggest the value of a large-scale community Connectivity Map project."

The entanglement-assisted quantum codes we describe do not require the dual-containing constraint necessary for standard quantum error–correcting codes, thus allowing us to “quantize” all of classical linear coding theory. In particular, efficient modern classical codes that attain the Shannon capacity can be made into entanglement-assisted quantum codes attaining the hashing bound (closely related to the quantum capacity). For systems without large amounts of shared entanglement, these codes can also be used as catalytic codes, in which a small amount of initial entanglement enables quantum communication."

https://openalex.org/W2093190210,"The importance of plant volatiles in mediating interactions between plant species is much debated. Here, we demonstrate that the parasitic plant Cuscuta pentagona (dodder) uses volatile cues for host location. Cuscuta pentagona seedlings exhibit directed growth toward nearby tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) and toward extracted tomato-plant volatiles presented in the absence of other cues. Impatiens (Impatiens wallerana) and wheat plants (Triticum aestivum) also elicit directed growth. Moreover, seedlings can distinguish tomato and wheat volatiles and preferentially grow toward the former. Several individual compounds from tomato and wheat elicit directed growth by C. pentagona, whereas one compound from wheat is repellent. These findings provide compelling evidence that volatiles mediate important ecological interactions among plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2097897593,"Soluble manganese(III) [Mn(III)] has been thought to disproportionate to soluble Mn(II) and particulate Mn IV O 2 in natural waters, although it persists as complexes in laboratory solutions. We report that, in the Black Sea, soluble Mn(III) concentrations were as high as 5 micromolar and constituted up to 100% of the total dissolved Mn pool. Depth profiles indicated that soluble Mn(III) was produced at the top of the suboxic zone by Mn(II) oxidation and at the bottom of the suboxic zone by Mn IV O 2 reduction, then stabilized in each case by unknown natural ligands. We also found micromolar concentrations of dissolved Mn(III) in the Chesapeake Bay. Dissolved Mn(III) can maintain the existence of suboxic zones because it can act as either an electron acceptor or donor. Our data indicate that Mn(III) should be ubiquitous at all water column and sediment oxic/anoxic interfaces in the environment."

We present a high-resolution imaging secondary ion mass spectrometry technique to reveal the lipid distribution within a phase-separated membrane with a lateral resolution of ∼100 nanometers. Quantitative information about the chemical composition within small lipid domains was obtained with the use of isotopic labels to identify each molecular species. Composition variations were detected within some domains."
https://openalex.org/W2056848570,"Time-resolved sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy permits the study of hitherto neglected ultrafast vibrational dynamics of neat water interfaces. Measurements on interfacial bonded OH stretch modes revealed relaxation behavior on sub-picosecond time scales in close resemblance to that of bulk water. Vibrational excitation is followed by spectral diffusion, vibrational relaxation, and thermalization in the hydrogen-bonding network. Dephasing of the excitation occurs in ≤100 femtoseconds. Population relaxation of the dangling OH stretch was found to have a time constant of 1.3 picoseconds, the same as that for excitation transfer between hydrogen-bonded and unbonded OH stretches of water molecules surrounded by acetone."
https://openalex.org/W2029109058,"We report here the application of a previously described method to directly determine the CO2 permeability (P(CO2)) of the cell membranes of normal human red blood cells (RBCs) vs. those deficient in aquaporin 1 (AQP1), as well as AQP1-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes. This method measures the exchange of (18)O between CO2, HCO3(-), and H2O in cell suspensions. In addition, we measure the alkaline surface pH (pH(S)) transients caused by the dominant effect of entry of CO2 vs. HCO3(-) into oocytes exposed to step increases in [CO2]. We report that 1) AQP1 constitutes the major pathway for molecular CO2 in human RBCs; lack of AQP1 reduces P(CO2) from the normal value of 0.15 +/- 0.08 (SD; n=85) cm/s by 60% to 0.06 cm/s. Expression of AQP1 in oocytes increases P(CO2) 2-fold and doubles the alkaline pH(S) gradient. 2) pCMBS, an inhibitor of the AQP1 water channel, reduces P(CO2) of RBCs solely by action on AQP1 as it has no effect in AQP1-deficient RBCs. 3) P(CO2) determinations of RBCs and pH(S) measurements of oocytes indicate that DIDS inhibits the CO2 pathway of AQP1 by half. 4) RBCs have at least one other DIDS-sensitive pathway for CO2. We conclude that AQP1 is responsible for 60% of the high P(CO2) of red cells and that another, so far unidentified, CO2 pathway is present in this membrane that may account for at least 30% of total P(CO2)."
https://openalex.org/W2020069533,"Generally, rotational isomerization about the carbon-carbon single bond in simple ethane derivatives in room-temperature solution under thermal equilibrium conditions has been too fast to measure. We achieved this goal using two-dimensional infrared vibrational echo spectroscopy to observe isomerization between the gauche and trans conformations of an ethane derivative, 1-fluoro-2-isocyanato-ethane ( 1 ), in a CCl 4 solution at room temperature. The isomerization time constant is 43 picoseconds (ps, 10 –12 s). Based on this value and on density functional theory calculations of the barrier heights of 1 , n -butane, and ethane, the time constants for n -butane and ethane internal rotation under the same conditions are ∼40 and ∼12 ps, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2000008518,"Proteins with multiple cellular functions provide biological diversity to eukaryotic cells. In the current studies, we identified the mitochondrial functions of human prohibitin 2 (PHB2), which was initially identified as a repressor of estrogen-dependent transcriptional activity. The mitochondrial complex of PHB2 consists of PHB1, voltage-dependent anion channel 2, adenine nucleotide translocator 2, and the anti-apoptotic Hax-1, which is a novel binding partner for PHB2. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of PHB2 in HeLa cells resulted in caspase-dependent apoptosis through down-regulation of Hax-1 and fragmentation of mitochondria. We also found that, although PHB2 is predominantly expressed in the mitochondria of HeLa cells, it translocates to nucleus in the presence of estrogen receptor α and estradiol. Here, we first demonstrated the roles of mammalian PHB2 in mitochondria and the molecular mechanism of its nuclear targeting and showed that PHB2 is a possible molecule directly coupling nuclear-mitochondrial interaction.

In eukaryotes, biological diversity is acquired from a limited number of genes due to the existence of proteins with multiple cellular functions. A key factor is the dynamic regulation of these diverse cellular functions.

Miki Y. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1643-1646PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular localization of PHBs has been confined to mitochondria in a variety of these species, although they also localize in nucleus in some mammalian cell lines (7Fusaro G. Dasgupta P.

To date, it is known that PHBs are localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane where they form a large protein complex (9Nijtmans L.G. Artal S.M. Grivell L.A. Coates P.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, variety functions of PHBs have been suggested, including a role in cell cycle regulation (1Nuell M.J.

Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In yeast, PHBs have been shown to exist in mitochondria and to function as chaperones that stabilize newly synthesized mitochondrial protein, possibly by negative regulation of the AAA protease (15Steglich G. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3435-3442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Even in Caenorhabditis elegans, PHBs are essential for embryonic viability and germ line differentiation, and deficiency of these proteins results in altered mitochondrial biogenesis (17Artal-Sanz M. Tsang W.Y. Willems E.M. Grivell L.A. Lemire B.D. van der Spek H. Nijtmans L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32091-32099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Alternatively, in mammals, knowledge of human PHBs focused on their transcriptional regulatory functions has been accumulated. Human PHB1 has also been shown to interact with the retinoblastoma protein, which results in the inhibition of the transcriptional activity of E2F (10Wang S. Nath N. Adlam M. Chellappan S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3501-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In a B-cell lymphoma line, stable overexpression of PHB1 protects the cells from camptothecin-induced apoptosis, possibly via down-regulation of E2F activity (18Fusaro G. Wang S. Chellappan S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4539-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human PHB2, also known as a repressor of estrogen receptor (ER) activity, has been shown to interact with and inhibit the transcriptional activity of the ER (13Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the involvement of mammalian PHB proteins in the regulation of transcription in the nucleus.On the contrary, in fibroblasts, mammalian PHB proteins mainly localize in mitochondria, and their expression is up-regulated by mitochondrial stress and down-regulated during cellular senescence (19Coates P.J. Nenutil R. McGregor A. Picksley S.M. Crouch D.H. Hall P.A. Wright E.G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that mammalian PHB proteins also have crucial roles in the mitochondria. Recently, human PHB1 was reported to associate with mitochondrial complex I, suggesting that PHB1 plays a role in complex assembly (20Bourges I. Ramus C. Mousson de Camaret B. Beugnot R. Remacle C. Cardol P. Hofhaus G. Issartel J.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, mammalian PHBs have been suggested to be involved not only in the regulation of transcription but also cellular senescence, apoptosis, and mitochondrial respiratory activity (9Nijtmans L.G. Artal S.M. Grivell L.A. Coates P.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 18Fusaro G. Wang S. Chellappan S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4539-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The molecular functions of PHBs in mitochondria, especially PHB2, however, remain unclear.In this study, to clarify the dynamic regulatory mechanism of the pleiotropic PHB2 in mammalian cells, we examined mitochondrial function of human PHB2 and then investigated its targeting mechanism to the nucleus. First, we identified the binding partners for PHB2 in the mitochondria by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis. Hax-1, which was initially identified as an HS1-binding protein (21Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Kitamura D. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar) and as an inhibitor of apoptosis (22Cilenti L. Soundarapandian M.M. Kyriazis G.A. Stratico V. Singh S. Gupta S. Bonventre J.V. Alnemri E.S. Zervos A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50295-50301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), was found to directly associate with PHB2 in mitochondria. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of PHB2 resulted in a reduction of the level of Hax-1 protein. In addition, caspase-mediated apoptotic cell death was enhanced in PHB2 knockdown cells. This induction of cell death was likely due to the down-regulation of Hax-1, because its knockdown also caused the same manner of cell death without a reduction of PHB2 protein level. Furthermore, the knockdown of PHB2 caused the fragmentation of mitochondria by a mechanism independent of Hax-1.Secondly, we found that, although PHB2 is predominantly expressed in the mitochondria of HeLa cells, it translocates to the nucleus in the presence of ERα and estradiol (E2). We further found that human PHB2 contains both an uncleavable mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) at its N terminus and an ERα-dependent nuclear localization sequence at its C terminus, suggesting that it is shuttled from the nucleus to mitochondria.Taken together, our results show that human PHB2 has pleiotropic functions in the mitochondria, including inhibition of apoptosis via the PHB2·Hax-1 complex and regulation of the mitochondrial morphology. We also demonstrated that, in the presence of ERα and E2, PHB2 is translocated into the nucleus where it functions as a repressor of transcription. PHB2 is a versatile molecule that couples transcription in the nucleus and regulation of mitochondrial function in the mitochondria, suggesting that it plays a role in communication between these two organelles.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—The coding regions of PHB1, PHB2, and Hax-1 were amplified by PCR from a human heart or HeLa cell cDNA library. Amino acids 1-50 and 45-272 of PHB1 and 1-50 and 51-299 of PHB2 were also amplified by PCR. The PCR products with 3× FLAG tag sequences or GFP-coding sequences at their 3′ termini were introduced into mammalian expression vector pCMV-SPORT (Invitrogen). Amino acids 1-100 and the full-length (1-299) of PHB2 were amplified by PCR and introduced into mammalian expression vector pEF4/Myc-His B (Invitrogen). The coding sequence of PHB2 was also inserted into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to express it as a GST fusion protein. For RNAi, siRNA sequences for PHB1 (5′-AACACAGCCTTCCTTCTGCTC-3′) (23Gamble S.C. Odontiadis M. Waxman J. Westbrook J.A. Dunn M.J. Wait R. Lam E.W. Bevan C.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2996-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), PHB2 (5′-AAGAACCCTGGCTACATCAAA-3′), and Hax-1 (5′-AACCAGAGAGGACAATGATCT-3′) were introduced into the pSilencer 3.1-H1 Puro vector (Ambion, Austin, TX).Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mitochondria were stained with rhodamine 123 (0.25 μg/ml) or MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRos (250 nm, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells expressing pSilencer 3.1-H1 Puro constructs were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Caspase activity was inhibited with 50 μm Z-VAD-FMK (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Cells expressing the ER-expression plasmid were cultured in Opti-MEM I without phenol red (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 nm ICI 182,780 (Tocris), and treated with 1 μm of E2 for 2 h. For inhibition of cytoplasmic translation, the cells were simultaneously cultured with 50 or 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX).Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were plated on 35-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass-bottomed dishes (Matsunami Glass Ind.) and fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were incubated with antibodies against FLAG (Sigma, rabbit polyclonal), cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen, mouse monoclonal), ERα (Upstate Biotechnology, rabbit polyclonal), or Myc (BD Biosciences, mouse monoclonal) in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2% horse serum. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) in PBST containing 2% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescent images were captured and analyzed with a μRadiance™ Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope System (Bio-Rad).Preparation and Fractionation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria were prepared from HeLa cells as previously described (24Satoh M. Hamamoto T. Seo N. Kagawa Y. Endo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 482-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To assess membrane association, mitochondria suspended in sucrose solution (0.25 m sucrose supplemented with 0.2 mm EDTA) were sonicated on ice. Intact mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant containing sonicated mitochondria was further centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 100,000 × g. The pellets were collected as the mitochondrial membrane fraction. The mitochondrial membrane fraction was then treated for 30 min on ice with 0.1 m Na2CO3 in sucrose solution. The solution was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 100,000 × g to separate the soluble proteins from the membranes.For the protease protection assay, mitochondria were treated for 20 min at room temperature with 0.25 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) in sucrose solution containing the indicated concentrations of digitonin (Sigma) or 1% Triton X-100. The reaction was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid.The submitochondrial fraction was prepared as follows: sonicated mitochondria in 0.45 m sucrose were layered onto a linear sucrose gradient (11 ml, 0.6-1.6 m sucrose in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 0.2 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 16 h at 100,000 × g. The gradient was collected in 25 0.5-ml fractions and then analyzed by Western blotting.Cell Counting—The living cell number in a 6-well plate was determined by trypan blue staining. Cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were suspended in 0.4% trypan blue solution (Invitrogen), and living cells were counted.Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands on acrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and cut out. In-gel digestion with trypsin was carried out as described by Shevchenko et al. (25Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Proteins were identified using a Finnigan LTQ liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system (Thermo Electron Corp.).Western Blotting—Samples were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% or 12% acrylamide) and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PHB1 (1:200, NeoMarkers), anti-PHB2 (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Hax-1 (1:250, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-cytochrome c (1:100, BD Pharmingen), anti-GAPDH (1:3000, Chemicon), anti-VDAC (1:2000, Calbiochem), anti-FLAG (1:2000, Sigma), anti-PDHE2 (1:1000, Molecular Probes), anti-OPA1 (1:1000 (24Satoh M. Hamamoto T. Seo N. Kagawa Y. Endo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 482-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar)), and anti-Mfn1/hFzo1 (1:100, rabbit anti-sera against the peptide fragment, CVQLENELENFTKQFLPSSNEES, corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the protein).Immunoprecipitation—The mitochondrial pellet from cells expressing PHB2-FLAG or Hax-1-FLAG was extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100). After sonication for 4 min on ice, the solution was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 × g. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by incubation of the supernatant with 5 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, mouse monoclonal) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for overnight.In Vitro Binding Assay—Using Escherichia coli XL2-blue, expression of GST-PHB2 was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The fusion protein was then affinity purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). FLAG-tagged Hax-1 and PHB1 were synthesized in vitro using the TnT SP6 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). The in vitro-translated products were mixed with GST or GST-PHB2 proteins in TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and then affinity purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B.RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of the total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR (SuperScript II, Invitrogen) using random hexamer primers for the RT reaction.RESULTSMammalian PHB Proteins Mainly Localize in the Mitochondria of HeLa Cells—In fibroblasts, mammalian PHB proteins are found mainly in the mitochondria (14Coates P.J. Jamieson D.J. Smart K. Prescott A.R. Hall P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas they are also localized in the nucleus in MCF7 cells (7Fusaro G. Dasgupta P. Rastogi S. Joshi B. Chellappan S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24834-24843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We expressed human PHB proteins with a FLAG tag at their C termini in HeLa cells and found that they are mainly present in the mitochondria where they colocalize with mitochondrial cytochrome c (Fig. 1A, left panel). When we expressed GFP fusion proteins of PHBs in MCF-7 or HeLa cells, like the FLAG-tagged proteins, PHB1-GFP and PHB2-GFP were expressed in the mitochondria of HeLa cells (Fig. 1A, right panel) along with cytochrome c (data not shown). We found that a portion of PHB2-GFP was also present in the nucleus of MCF7 cells, whereas PHB1-GFP was only present in the mitochondria in these cells (Fig. 1A, right panel). These results demonstrate that, in HeLa cells, PHB proteins mainly localize in the mitochondria.Association of PHB2 with Hax-1 in Mitochondria—To clarify the function of human PHB2 in mitochondria, we next performed immunoprecipitation studies using a mitochondrial extract from HeLa cells expressing PHB2-FLAG. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody (FLAG-IP) revealed that PHB2-FLAG specifically and reproducibly coprecipitates four proteins with molecular masses of 30-37 kDa (Fig. 1B), which were not detected in untransfected control extract (data not shown). Mass spectrometric analysis identified these proteins as PHB1, HS-associated protein X-1 (Hax-1) (21Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Kitamura D. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar), voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2), and adenine nucleotide translocator 2 (ANT2), respectively (Fig. 1B). We expected that PHB1 would coprecipitate with PHB2, because they form stable complex in mitochondria (9Nijtmans L.G. Artal S.M. Grivell L.A. Coates P.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). ANT and VDAC are components of the permeability transition pore (PTP), and the association of PHB2 with ANT or VDAC has been reported as a possible mitochondrial nucleoid complex in Xenopus (26Bogenhagen D.F. Wang Y. Shen E.L. Kobayashi R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1205-1216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, Hax-1 appears to be a novel binding partner of PHB2. The interaction between PHB2-FLAG and Hax-1 in the mitochondrial extract was confirmed by Western blotting with an antiHax-1 antibody following to FLAG-IP (Fig. 1C, upper panel). We further confirmed that Hax-1-FLAG coimmunoprecipitates with PHB2, PHB1, and VDAC (Fig. 1C, lower panel).Next, to determine whether the interaction between PHB2 and Hax-1 is direct, we performed in vitro pull-down assays. GST-PHB2 directly bound to Hax-1 (Fig. 1D, lane 6), but PHB1, which was believed to directly interact with PHB2 (14Coates P.J. Jamieson D.J. Smart K. Prescott A.R. Hall P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not pulled down by GST-PHB2 (Fig. 1D, lane 4). In addition, the presence of PHB1 did not disturb the interaction between GST-PHB2 and Hax-1 (Fig. 1D, lane 7).Hax-1 Is an Integral Protein of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane—Hax-1, originally isolated as an HS-1 binding protein, is known to localize mainly in mitochondria (21Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Kitamura D. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that FLAG-tagged Hax-1 is mainly localized in the mitochondria of HeLa cells (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Mitochondrial Hax-1 integrated in the outer membrane localized in the intermembrane space. A, C-terminally FLAG-tagged Hax-1 was expressed in HeLa cells. The HeLa cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-FLAG (α-FLAG) and anti-cytochrome c antibodies (α-cyt. c). As shown in the merged image (Merge), Hax-1 colocalizes with mitochondrial cytochrome c. Scale bars, 10 μm. B, mitochondria from HeLa cells were sonicated (sonic.) and separated into supernatants (sup.) and membrane-pellets (ppt.) by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The membrane pellets were further treated with Na2CO3 (alkali) and separated into “sup.” and “ppt.” by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies (α) against PHB1, PHB2, Hax-1, and cytochrome c (cyt. c). C, the outer membrane (OM) and the inner membrane (IM) fractions were prepared by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of submitochondrial particles. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with indicated antibodies. The Western blot analysis revealed that Hax-1 and the outer membrane protein VDAC are present in the outer membrane fraction. D, mitochondria were treated with various concentrations of trypsin, digitonin, and Triton X-100 and then analyzed by Western blotting with indicated antibodies. The protease protection assay showed that Hax-1 and cytochrome c are localized in the intermembrane space.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To clarify the submitochondrial localization of Hax-1, we initially examined whether Hax-1 is a membrane-integrated protein. Following sonication of HeLa cell mitochondria, most of the Hax-1 protein remained in the mitochondrial membrane pellets as did the integral inner membrane protein PHB1 and the inner membrane-associated protein cytochrome c (Fig. 2B, lane 3). As expected, alkali treatment of the mitochondrial membrane pellets released cytochrome c, an inner membrane-associated protein, from the membrane pellets (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, Hax-1 as well as PHB1 and PHB2 remained in alkali-washed membrane pellets, indicating that they are integral mitochondrial membrane proteins (Fig. 2B, lane 5).We further examined whether Hax-1 is integrated in the outer or inner mitochondrial membrane. Submitochondrial particles were fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the outer membrane and inner membrane fractions were collected. The effectiveness of the separation of these two membrane types was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies to the outer membrane protein VDAC and the inner membrane protein PHB1. We found that Hax-1 was present in the outer membrane fraction as along with VDAC (Fig. 2C), indicating that Hax-1 is integrated in the outer mitochondrial membrane.Protease protection assay was performed to further define the submitochondrial localization of Hax-1. Hax-1 as well as the mitochondrial matrix protein pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 subunit and the intermembrane space protein cytochrome c or optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) remained in intact mitochondria after trypsin treatment (Fig. 2D, lane 2). Selective disruption of the outer membrane with digitonin decreased Hax-1, cytochrome c, and OPA1 levels following trypsin treatment but not effect the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 (Fig. 2D, lane 4), demonstrating that, like cytochrome c and OPA1, Hax-1 localizes in the intermembrane space. PHB proteins have been reported to be mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, and it has been suggested that their C termini are exposed to the intermembrane space in yeast (15Steglich G. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3435-3442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, PHB proteins are known to be resistant to protease treatment after disruption of the outer membrane (19Coates P.J. Nenutil R. McGregor A. Picksley S.M. Crouch D.H. Hall P.A. Wright E.G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Berger K.H. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4043-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which may be due to their tight folding. Our experiments are consistent with these previous studies that PHB proteins are resistant to proteolytic degradation following disruption of the outer membrane.Knockdown of PHB2 Induces Reduction of Hax-1 Protein and Apoptosis—To clarify the function of human PHB2 in mitochondria and the significance of its interaction with Hax-1, we performed RNAi-mediated knockdown studies. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) for PHB1 or PHB2 based on a short hairpin RNA expression vector containing a puromycin-resistant gene was expressed in HeLa cells. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression levels of PHB1 and PHB2 mRNAs were specifically reduced by siRNAs for PHB1 (siPHB1) and PHB2 (siPHB2), respectively (Fig. 3A). Western blotting confirmed that siPHB1 and siPHB2 decreased the levels of PHB1 and PHB2 but did not affect the expression of other mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c, VDAC, and pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 subunit) or cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Fig. 3B). Although the siR-NAs were specific for each PHB protein at the mRNA level (Fig. 3A), the protein levels of PHB1 and PHB2 were reduced by siPHB2 and siPHB1, respectively. This is not surprising because the two PHB proteins are interdependent in yeast and C. elegans so that deletion of one decreases the protein level of the other (17Artal-Sanz M. Tsang W.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2068171707,"Quantification of the atmospheric concentration of CO2 ([CO2]atm) during warm periods of Earth's history is important because burning of fossil fuels may produce future [CO2]atm approaching 1000 parts per million by volume (ppm). The early Eocene (~56 to 49 million years ago) had the highest prolonged global temperatures of the past 65 million years. High Eocene [CO2]atm is established from sodium carbonate minerals formed in saline lakes and preserved in the Green River Formation, western United States. Coprecipitation of nahcolite (NaHCO3) and halite (NaCl) from surface waters in contact with the atmosphere indicates [CO2]atm > 1125 ppm (four times preindustrial concentrations), which confirms that high [CO2]atm coincided with Eocene warmth."
https://openalex.org/W2028439746,"Immune receptors that show high mutual sequence similarity and have antagonizing signaling properties are called paired receptors, and are believed to fine-tune immune responses. Siglecs are sialic acid-recognizing receptors of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily expressed on immune cells. Human Siglec-5, encoded by SIGLEC5 gene, has four extracellular Ig-like domains and a cytosolic inhibitory motif. We discovered human Siglec-14 with three Ig-like domains, encoded by the SIGLEC14 gene, adjacent to SIGLEC5. Human Siglec-14 has almost complete sequence identity with human Siglec-5 at the first two Ig-like domains, shows a glycan binding preference similar to that of human Siglec-5, and associates with the activating adapter protein DAP12. Thus, Siglec-14 and Siglec-5 appear to be the first glycan binding paired receptors. Near-complete sequence identity of the amino-terminal part of human Siglec-14 and Siglec-5 indicates partial gene conversion between SIGLEC14 and SIGLEC5. Remarkably, SIGLEC14 and SIGLEC5 in other primates also show evidence of gene conversions within each lineage. Evidently, balancing the interactions between Siglec-14, Siglec-5 and their common ligand(s) had selective advantage during the course of evolution. The ""essential arginine"" critical for sialic acid recognition in both Siglec-14 and Siglec-5 is present in humans but mutated in almost all great ape alleles."
https://openalex.org/W2041371648,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is highly expressed in the brain and has been shown to alter the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in vitro. Previously we developed mice that overexpress a functional LRP minireceptor (mLRP2) in their brains and crossed them to the PDAPP mouse model of Alzheimer disease. Overexpression of mLRP2 in 22-month-old PDAPP mice with amyloid plaques increased a pool of carbonate-soluble Aβ in the brain and worsened memory-related behavior. In the current study, we examined the effects of mLRP2 overexpression on 3-month-old PDAPP mice that had not yet developed amyloid plaques. We found significantly higher levels of membrane-associated Aβ42 in the hippocampus of mice that overexpressed mLRP2. Using immunohistochemical methods, we observed significant intraneuronal Aβ42 in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of PDAPP mice, which frequently co-localized with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. Interestingly, PDAPP mice lacking apolipoprotein E (apoE) had much less intraneuronal Aβ42. We also found that PC12 cells overexpressing mLRP2 cleared Aβ42 and Aβ40 more rapidly from media than PC12 cells transfected with the vector only. Preincubation of apoE3 or apoE4 with Aβ42 increased the rate of Aβ clearance, and this effect was partially blocked by receptor-associated protein. Our results support the hypothesis that LRP binds and endocytoses Aβ42 both directly and via apoE but that endocytosed Aβ42 is not completely degraded and accumulates in intraneuronal lysosomes.

These observations suggest that changes in LRP expression levels may affect risk for AD by altering both the processing of APP and the clearance of Aβ. To study the role of LRP in the brain, our laboratory previously cloned a section of the extremely large human LRP receptor (mLRP2) into the MoPrP.Xho transgenic mouse vector and developed transgenic mice that overexpress mLRP2 (14Zerbinatti C.V. Wozniak D.F. Cirrito J. Cam J.A. Osaka H. Bales K.R. Zhuo M. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Bu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The mLRP2 section or minireceptor of LRP behaves similarly in vitro to full-length LRP with respect to ligand binding and internalization (14Zerbinatti C.V. Wozniak D.F. Cirrito J. Cam J.A. Osaka H.

Mice overexpressing mLRP2 were then bred to the well characterized PDAPP mouse model of AD, which expresses human APP with a mutation that causes familial AD (V717F) and develops amyloid plaques in the brain beginning at ∼6 months of age (15Games D.

We found that 22-month-old PDAPP/mLRP2 and PDAPP/wild-type mice had similar levels of total amyloid deposition in their brains but that PDAPP/mLRP2 mice had increased levels of Aβ in carbonate-soluble brain extracts (14Zerbinatti C.V.

Furthermore, this carbonate-soluble Aβ pool was highly correlated with memory deficits in old mice. In the current study, we examined whether overexpression of mLRP2 also affects Aβ levels in 3-month-old mice that have not yet developed amyloid plaques. We hypothesized that changes in Aβ at this age are more likely to reflect subtle changes in Aβ metabolism resulting from mLRP2 overexpression without the confounding factor of severe pathology as in the older mice. Based on our previous work (14Zerbinatti C.V. Wozniak D.F. Cirrito J. Cam J.A. Osaka H. Bales K.R. Zhuo M. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Bu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, we investigated whether membrane-associated Aβ could represent intracellular Aβ. Animals—The mLRP2 transgene was expressed by the MoPrP.Xho vector as previously described (14Zerbinatti C.V. Wozniak D.F. Cirrito J. Cam J.A. Osaka H. Bales K.R. Zhuo M. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Bu G.

The right hemisphere was immersion fixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS for histological analysis. The left hemisphere was further dissected, and brain regions were frozen for biochemical analysis.

Cells—PC12 cell were transfected with the pcDNA vector only or the pcDNA vector encoding mLRP2 cDNA tagged with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. Stably expressing clones were selected based on cell morphology and mLRP2 expression levels, which were evaluated by Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining with anti-HA antibody. High expressing lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml G418. Sequential Brain Extraction—Hippocampi were homogenized with 25 strokes in 15 volumes of cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, containing the protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 μg/ml) and aprotinin (20 μg/ml) using a 1-ml dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (TBS extracts) were transferred to new tubes and kept on ice. After a single wash with 50 μl of cold TBS, pellets were resuspended in 15 volumes of cold TBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. The homogenates were spun again at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (TBS-Triton X-100 extracts) were transferred to new tubes and kept on ice. Pellets were spun once for 5 min, and all leftover supernatant was removed. 400 μl of 5 m guanidine solution containing protease inhibitors were added to the final pellet. Samples were vortexed to detach the pellet from the bottom of the tubes and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. The homogenates were spun again at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (guanidine extracts) were transferred to new tubes and kept on ice. Aβ40 and Aβ42 Determinations—Human Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were determined in all hippocampal extracts (TBS, TBS-Triton X-100, and guanidine) and CSF by sandwich ELISA under denaturing conditions (0.5 m guanidine). The capturing antibody was 2G3 for Aβ40 and 21F12 for Aβ42, and the detection antibody was biotinylated 3D6 as previously described (14Zerbinatti C.V. Wozniak D.F. Cirrito J. Cam J.A. Osaka H.

Samples were diluted 10-fold in PBS containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and human Aβ40 and Aβ42 standards were also solubilized in PBS containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin as well as 10% of the buffer used to obtain each sample (TBS, TBS-Triton X-100, or 5 m guanidine). Mouse ApoE Determination—A previously described sandwich ELISA for mouse apoE with a sensitivity of ∼1 ng/ml was used (17Wahrle S.E. Jiang H. Parsadanian M. Legleiter J. Han X. Fryer J.D.

Brain samples were sonicated in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and protease inhibitors. Samples were spun to pellet cell debris (20,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C), and supernatants were diluted in PBS containing 0.025% Tween 20 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Standards were based on pooled plasma from C57/Bl6 mice containing 68 μg/ml apoE, and brain samples from apoE knock-out mice were used for background subtraction. Western Blot Analysis—Hippocampi were dounce homogenized in 15 volumes of TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 with the protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 μg/ml) and aprotinin (20 μg/ml). Equal amounts of protein from the tissue lysates were separated using 10% Tris-Tricine gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blotted with anti-APP antibody (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA), and immunoreactive bands were detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Immunostaining—Right hemispheres were cut in the coronal plane on a freezing sliding microtome. Floating brain sections (50 μm) were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in TBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 45 min. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antibody to Aβ42 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and a monoclonal antibody to neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) (Chemicon International), both at 1:500 dilution in TBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum. Secondary antibodies AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were diluted 1:1000 for detection. Fluorescence was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. A mouse-specific rat antibody to LAMP-1 (1D4B) was used as hybridoma tissue culture supernatant (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) at 1:4 dilution with secondary antibody Alexa-Fluor 568 goat anti-rat IgG at 1:1000 dilution (Molecular Probes) for detection. Quantitation of Aβ42 immunoreactivity associated with neurons from PDAPP/Apoe+/+ and PDAPP/Apoe-/- mice was performed using the ImageJ software from the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Briefly, each of the images obtained under identical settings by confocal microscopy using ×40 magnification was split into RGB channels (red, green, and blue) and a total of 25 neurons/section were randomly circled in the red channel (NeuN). The intensity of fluorescence signal associated with each neuron was then calculated by redirecting measurements to the green channel (Aβ42). In Vitro Aβ Clearance—In vitro Aβ clearance experiments were performed using PC12 cells stably transfected with mLRP2 or the pcDNA vector. PC12 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of ∼300,000 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight. Serum-containing medium was then replaced with neurobasal medium containing N2 supplement and nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) to stimulate differentiation overnight. Cell-secreted Aβ was obtained from PDAPP primary neuronal cultures that contained ∼60% Aβ42. This high Aβ42: Aβ40 ratio is typical of Aβ produced by PDAPP mice (18Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R.

The cell-secreted Aβ was diluted 10-fold in neurobasal medium plus B27 and nerve growth factor and was added to the differentiated PC12 cells (final Aβ concentration ∼500 pg/ml). In some conditions, diluted Aβ-containing medium was preincubated for 2 h at 37°C with apoE particles (10 μg/ml) derived from human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with human apoE3 or apoE4 (12LaDu M.J.

In other conditions, cells were pretreated for 15 min with 0.5 μm receptor-associated protein (RAP), a LRP antagonist (21Bu G. Sun Y. Schwartz A.L. Holtzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13359-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), prior to the addition of Aβ-conditioned medium preincubated with apoE3 particles. After 24 h, Aβ levels in the incubation medium were quantified by ELISA and compared with the values of the original Aβ medium, kept at 37 °C. The difference in Aβ levels was then divided by cell protein content in each well (n = 3). We have previously shown that overexpression of mLRP2 significantly increases a carbonate-soluble Aβ pool in the hippocampus and cortex of 22-month-old PDAPP mice with abundant plaque deposition (14Zerbinatti C.V. Wozniak D.F. Cirrito J. Cam J.A. Osaka H. Bales K.R. Zhuo M. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Bu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined whether overexpression of mLRP2 affects Aβ levels in 3-month-old PDAPP mice that have not yet developed amyloid plaques in the brain. To examine the different pools of Aβ, we performed sequential extraction of the brain tissue. Previously, we examined carbonate (soluble) and guanidine (insoluble) extracts from brain. For these experiments, we added an extra step into our protocol so that we could separate the soluble extract into a water-soluble extract with few membrane-associated proteins and a detergent-soluble extract enriched for membrane-associated proteins. Instead of carbonate, we used TBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 because this buffer is more widely used to extract membrane proteins and yields results similar to those obtained with carbonate. APP, as well as other membrane proteins such as transferrin, PS1, and calnexin, were extracted by both carbonate and TBS with 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). The hippocampus was first homogenized in TBS and centrifuged, which provided a supernatant with water-soluble proteins that contained almost none of the intramembrane protein APP (Fig. 1A). Next, the pellet from the TBS extraction was rehomogenized in TBS with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged, resulting in a supernatant containing detergent-soluble, mainly membrane-associated proteins such as APP (Fig. 1A). Finally, the pellet was homogenized again in 5 m guanidine and centrifuged, allowing extraction of relatively insoluble proteins. The TBS, TBS-Triton X-100, and guanidine extracts from the brain were then assayed for Aβ40 and Aβ42 by ELISA. We found that overexpressing mLRP2 in PDAPP mice does not significantly affect levels of Aβ40 in any of the three different extracts from the hippocampus (Fig. 1, B-D). TBS-soluble Aβ42 was also not different in PDAPP/mLRP2 and PDAPP/wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). However, detergent- and guanidine-soluble Aβ42 was significantly higher in PDAPP mice overexpressing mLRP2 compared with non-transgenic littermates. Specifically, detergent-soluble Aβ42 levels were increased by ∼20% in PDAPP/mLRP2 mice, and guanidine-soluble Aβ42 levels were increased by ∼12% in PDAPP/mLRP2 mice compared with PDAPP/wild-type control mice (Fig. 1, C and D). The selective increase of detergent- and guanidine-soluble Aβ42 suggests that mLRP2 affects Aβ42 that is associated with membranes and not freely soluble Aβ42. Although these effects are small, they demonstrate the involvement of LRP in regulating brain Aβ levels. Western blotting of APP showed no differences between PDAPP/mLRP2 and PDAPP/wild-type mice (Fig. 1A). We also examined the levels of CTF-β, a fragment of APP produced by β-secretase cleavage of APP that is cleaved by γ-secretase to form Aβ. CTF-β levels were not different in PDAPP/mLRP2 and PDAPP/wild-type mice by Western blotting (data not shown). These data suggest that APP expression and APP processing is not drastically altered by mLRP2 overexpression, although it does not rule out the possibility that subtle changes in APP expression or APP processing are occurring that affect Aβ levels. Interestingly, although Aβ42 levels in the brain significantly increased in the PDAPP/mLRP2 overexpressing mice, total Aβ was significantly decreased in the CSF of mLRP2 versus wild-type mice, with a trend toward decreased Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. 1E). The increased amount of Aβ42 in the brain tissue of the PDAPP/mLRP2 mice, coupled with the decreased amount of Aβ in the CSF of the PDAPP/mLRP2 mice, suggests that mLRP2 overexpression increases the internalization of extracellular Aβ. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that mLRP2 binds and internalizes Aβ, either directly or via endocytosis of apoE-Aβ complexes, and that mLRP2 overexpression increases the internalization of Aβ42. To further examine the mechanism by which Aβ42 levels are altered in young PDAPP mice, we visualized and quantified intracellular Aβ using immunohistochemical methods. We observed significant Aβ42 associated with neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and frontal cortex (Fig. 2, A and B). Double labeling of Aβ42 and LAMP1 revealed that much of the Aβ42 is localized to the lysosomes within neurons (Fig. 2C). Double labeling of Aβ42 and the transferrin receptor (an endosomal marker) or BiP (an endoplasmic reticulum marker) did not show any significant co-localization (data not shown). Importantly, the anti-Aβ42 antibody showed no staining when preincubated with an excess of Aβ42 peptide (Fig. 2D), supporting the conclusion that we were staining Aβ42. Additionally, the anti-Aβ42 antibody did not stain brain sections from wild-type mice that do not express human Aβ (data not shown). Furthermore, previous studies have shown that neither APP nor CTF-β are significantly changed in Apoe-/- mice when compared with wild-type mice, further supporting our conclusion that we were staining Aβ42 and not APP or CTF-β (19DeMattos R.B. Cirrito J.R. Parsadanian M. May P.C. O'Dell M.A. Taylor J.W. Harmony J.A. Aronow B.J. Bales K.R. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Neuron. 2004; 41: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Because overexpression of mLRP2 is likely to affect levels of ligands such as apoE, and apoE levels are known to affect Aβ metabolism, we determined the apoE levels in mLRP2 and wild-type mice. We found that apoE levels were 25% lower in mice overexpressing mLRP2 (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with the known role of LRP as an apoE receptor that facilitates internalization and degradation of apoE. Furthermore, we examined whether the presence of the intraneuronal Aβ42 we previously observed (Fig. 2) depended on apoE. We found that PDAPP/Apoe-/- mice had ∼50% less intraneuronal Aβ42 (Fig. 3, B and C). This demonstrates that apoE plays a major role in the uptake of Aβ42 by neurons, possibly by forming apoE-Aβ complexes that bind to LRP and other receptors and are endocytosed. To directly address the question of whether mLRP2 overexpression affects intraneuronal Aβ42 levels, we examined whether PDAPP/mLRP2 and PDAPP/wild-type mice had different levels of intraneuronal Aβ42 staining. We did not see any significant differences in staining (data not shown). However, the sensitivity of this technique is relatively low and we were expecting only a small difference, so we performed another experiment to answer this question. We stably transfected PC12 cells with mLRP2 or the vector only and induced differentiation of the PC12 cells with nerve growth factor. We then added Aβ secreted by primary neurons derived from PDAPP mice. PC12 cells overexpressing mLRP2 cleared significantly more Aβ42 than cells expressing the vector only (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained when preparations of oligomeric Aβ42 were added to the cells (data not shown). Clearance of Aβ42 by mLRP2-overexpressing cells was increased by preincubation of Aβ with apoE3 or apoE4 particles (Fig. 4A). It is not surprising that Aβ42 preincubated with apoE3 or apoE4 had a similar rate of clearance because apoE3 and apoE4 have similar binding properties to LRP (22Narita M. Holtzman D.M. Fagan A.M.

The addition of RAP partially blocked clearance of Aβ42 preincubated with apoE3 (Fig. 4A). We also examined the clearance of Aβ40 and found that it was much slower than Aβ42 clearance (Fig. 4B). Aβ40 clearance was increased by the overexpression of mLRP2, but to a lesser extent than Aβ42 (54% increase in clearance for Aβ40, 80% increase for Aβ42). Additionally, clearance of Aβ40 was not affected by preincubation with apoE3 particles (Fig. 4B). This suggests that both Aβ42 and Aβ40 are cleared by an LRP-mediated process but that apoE plays a larger role in clearance of Aβ42. Overall, these data support two conclusions. 1) mLRP2 overexpression increases the internalization of Aβ42, even in the absence of apoE. This suggests that Aβ42 binds directly to mLRP2 and undergoes endocytosis. 2) ApoE enhances the clearance of Aβ42 via mLRP2. We hypothesize that Aβ binds to apoE and forms an apoE-Aβ complex, which then binds to mLRP2 and undergoes endocytosis. However, while the endocytosed apoE is rapidly degraded, a portion of the Aβ42 accumulates and possibly aggregates inside lysosomes. Our current study demonstrates that overexpression of mLRP2 increases detergent- and guanidine-soluble Aβ42 in the hippocampus of 3-month-old PDAPP mice that have not yet developed amyloid plaques. We also found significantly decreased total Aβ in the CSF of PDAPP/mLRP2 versus PDAPP/wild-type mice, with a trend toward decreases in both Aβ40 and Aβ42. The increase in cellular Aβ42 and decrease in extracellular Aβ suggest that Aβ42 may be endocytosed more rapidly by mLRP2 overexpressing cells and may accumulate intracellularly. To test this hypothesis, we developed a protocol for staining Aβ42 associated with neurons. Using this protocol, we found significant amounts of intraneuronal Aβ42 in 3-month-old PDAPP mice, most of which was localized inside lysosomes. Interestingly, we found that the levels of intraneuronal Aβ42 were dramatically lower in PDAPP mice lacking apoE. Because mLRP2 mice have slightly higher levels of membrane-associated Aβ42, we expected PDAPP/mLRP2 mice to have higher levels of intraneuronal Aβ42 than PDAPP/wild-type mice. However, we were not able to detect a significant difference in intraneuronal Aβ42 between PDAPP/mLRP2 and PDAPP/wild-type animals, probably because the protocol was not sensitive enough to detect a small effect. To study whether mLRP2 affects Aβ42 clearance in another system, we made PC12 cell lines that were stably transfected with mLRP2 or vector only. We found that the mLRP2-overexpressing cells cleared significantly more Aβ42 from the medium than cells expressing the vector only. In addition, preincubation of the Aβ-containing medium with apoE3 or apoE4 particles increased the clearance of Aβ42 by the cells, and this effect was partially blocked by addition of RAP. Our initial hypothesis based on previous studies was that Aβ in detergent-soluble extracts from the hippocampus of 3-month-old PDAPP/mLRP2 mice would be higher than in PDAPP/wild-type mice. This was essentially correct, but the increase in Aβ was only in the more amyloidogenic Aβ42 species and only in the detergent- and guanidine-soluble extracts. We speculate that endocytosed Aβ42 may not be degraded as effectively as Aβ40 in lysosomes. The finding that only detergent- and guanidine-soluble Aβ42 was increased in the PDAPP/mLRP2 mice suggests that mLRP2 is specifically affecting a pool of Aβ42 that is membrane bound or insoluble. We did not specifically test whether the Aβ42 that required guanidine for extraction was in an insoluble, oligomeric state or bound to membrane domains that are poorly soluble in 1% Triton X-100. However, other investigators have found that intraneuronal Aβ42 deposits are reactive to antibodies specific for Aβ42 oligomers (24Takahashi R.H. Almeida C.G. Kearney P.F. Yu F. Lin M.T. Milner T.A. Gouras G.K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3592-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The increase of Aβ42 in brain tissue and decrease in Aβ in CSF suggested that the ratio of intracellular to extracellular Aβ was increasing, perhaps as a result of intracellular Aβ42 accumulation. We investigated this possibility using immunohistochemistry to visualize intracellular Aβ42. The accumulation of Aβ inside neurons has been observed in both AD patients and mice with brain amyloid deposition (25Chui D.H. Tanahashi H. Ozawa K. Ikeda S. Checler F. Ueda O. Suzuki H. Araki W.

Intraneuronal Aβ accumulation appears to occur prior to extracellular amyloid deposition and is a prominent neuropathological feature in brain regions that are vulnerable in AD, such as the frontal cortex and the hippocampus. In a triple transgenic AD mouse model with the PS1 (M146V), APP (Swe), and tau (P301L) transgenes, deficits in synaptic transmission and long term potentiation were observed before plaque and tau pathology, but in the presence of early intraneuronal Aβ accumulation (29Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R. Mattson M.P. Akbari Y. LaFerla F.M.

It has been suggested that intraneuronal Aβ pathology causes the onset of early cognitive deficits in this triple transgenic AD mouse model (30Billings L.M. Oddo S. Green K.N. McGaugh J.L.

In other experiments, it has been shown that intracellular Aβ accumulation directly affects cell viability, ultimately resulting in neuronal death (31Ditaranto K. Tekirian T.L. Yang A.J. Neurobiol.

These observations raise the hypothesis that intraneuronal Aβ accumulation may be one of the initial steps in a cascade of events leading to AD (35Glabe C. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We found that intraneuronal Aβ42 co-localized with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. Previous studies have shown that intraneuronal Aβ is present within endosomes, multivesicular bodies, and lysosomes (24Takahashi R.H. Almeida C.G. Kearney P.F. Yu F. Lin M.T. Milner T.A. Gouras G.K.

If Aβ42 is concentrated within small organelles such as lysosomes, this could favor the aggregation of Aβ42. Additionally, the acidic pH characteristic of endocytic compartments may provide a favorable environment for Aβ oligomerization (39Stine W.B. Dahlgren Jr., K.N. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11612-11622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 40Pasternak S.H. Callahan J.W. Mahuran D.J. J. Alzheimer's Dis. 2004; 6: 53-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, early abnormalities in the endosomal-lysosomal system that precede amyloid deposition have been reported in sporadic AD and Down syndrome (36Cataldo A.M. Petanceska S. Terio N.B. Peterhoff C.M. Durham R. Mercken M. Mehta P.D. Buxbaum J. Haroutunian V. Nixon R.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; 25: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 41Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the Aβ42 that accumulates within the endocytic compartments of neurons results from extracellular uptake of Aβ42 or intracellular generation of Aβ42 is not yet clear. However, chronic infusion of synthetic Aβ42 oligomers with transforming growth factor β-2 into the ventricles of wild-type mice results in intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation, suggesting that extracellular uptake of Aβ42 may result in intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation. RAP markedly reduces this accumulation, which indicates that LRP plays a role in this process (42Harris-White M.E. Balverde Z. Lim G.P. Kim P. Miller S.A. Hammer H. Galasko D. Frautschy S.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The finding that PDAPP mice lacking apoE have markedly reduced levels of intraneuronal Aβ42 demonstrates that apoE plays an important role in the neuronal uptake and/or accumulation of Aβ42. Although it has previously been shown that PDAPP/Apoe-/- mice have reductions in both total Aβ and fibrillar Aβ, these studies were performed with older mice with prominent Aβ deposition (43Holtzman D.M. Bales K.R. Tenkova T. Fagan A.M. Parsadanian M. Sartorius L.J. Mackey B. Olney J. McKeel D. Wozniak D. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, our studies were performed in 3-month-old mice prior to plaque deposition and therefore suggest that Aβ42 begins to accumulate inside neurons even before plaques are deposited in tissues. Additionally, our in vitro results demonstrate that apoE can increase the uptake of Aβ42 via binding to LRP and perhaps other members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. This supports the hypothesis that extracellular uptake of apoE-Aβ complexes can lead to intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation. However, although increased endocytosis of apoE-Aβ complexes likely leads to lower brain apoE levels, such as we found in mLRP2 mice, Aβ42 is not degraded completely following endocytosis and accumulates. Although our current results support a role of LRP in intraneuronal Aβ accumulation, our studies were largely performed with a LRP minireceptor, mLRP2. The extremely large size of LRP (∼600 kDa) makes it technically challenging to overexpress the full-length receptor either in transgenic animals or stable cell lines. Because our previous studies have confirmed the functionality of mLRP2 (46Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Li Y. Osaka H. FitzGerald D.J. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we believe that mLRP2 is an appropriate tool for studying ligand binding to full-length LRP. Future studies should be directed to studying the function of endogenous LRP in intraneuronal Aβ accumulation by conditional knock out or virally mediated gene knock-down approaches. In summary, the hypothesis that Aβ clearance by neurons is a protective mechanism against AD needs to be reconsidered. Provided that all internalized Aβ is efficiently degraded within lysosomes, this pathway may indeed be protective. However, our present and previous published studies suggest that this may not be the case and that intraneuronal Aβ accumulation may be pathogenic. Furthermore, reducing the endocytosis of Aβ by neurons may have a therapeutic effect on AD.

https://openalex.org/W1984031632,"Autosomal dominant Parkinson disease (PD) is caused by duplication or triplication of the alpha-synuclein gene as well as by the A30P, E46K, and A53T mutations. The mechanisms are unknown. Reactive astrocytes in the substantia nigra of PD and MPTP-treated monkeys display high levels of the inflammatory mediator intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), indicating that chronic inflammation contributes to the degeneration. Here we report that alpha-synuclein strongly stimulates human astrocytes as well as human U-373 MG astrocytoma cells to up-regulate both interleukin (IL)-6 and ICAM-1 (ED50=5 microg ml(-1)). The mutated forms are more potent stimulators than wild-type (WT) alpha-synuclein in these assays. We demonstrate by immunoblotting analysis that this up-regulation is associated with activation of the major mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. It is also attenuated by PD 98059, an inhibitor of the MAPK/extracellular-regulated kinase kinase MEK1/2, SP 600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and SB 202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK. The inhibitory effects on human astrocytes have IC50 values of 2, 5, and 1.5 microM respectively. We hypothesize that the neuroinflammation stimulated by release of an excess of normal alpha-synuclein or by release of its mutated forms can be involved in the pathobiology of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2032936777,"Ginsenoside-Rg1, the most prevalent active constituent of ginseng, is a potent proangiogenic factor of vascular endothelial cells. This suggests that Rg1 may be a new modality for angiotherapy. Rg1 can activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, the regulatory steps downstream from GR that promote Rg1-induced angiogenesis have not been elucidated. Here we showed for the first time that Rg1 was a potent stimulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and importantly this induction was mediated through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and β-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent pathway via the GR. Rg1 stimulation resulted in an increase in the level of β-catenin, culminating its nuclear accumulation, and subsequent activation of VEGF expression. Transfection of a stable form of β-catenin (S37A) or the use of a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor to stabilize β-catenin induced VEGF synthesis, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of β-catenin did not, confirming that the effect was β-catenin-specific. Using a luciferase reporter gene assay, we observed that Rg1 increased T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcriptional activity. These events were mediated via a PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of the inhibitory Ser9 residue of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In addition, the GR antagonist RU486 was able to inhibit Rg1-induced PI3K/Akt and β-catenin activation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism responsible for Rg1 functions. Ginsenoside-Rg1, the most prevalent active constituent of ginseng, is a potent proangiogenic factor of vascular endothelial cells. This suggests that Rg1 may be a new modality for angiotherapy. Rg1 can activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, the regulatory steps downstream from GR that promote Rg1-induced angiogenesis have not been elucidated. Here we showed for the first time that Rg1 was a potent stimulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and importantly this induction was mediated through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and β-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent pathway via the GR. Rg1 stimulation resulted in an increase in the level of β-catenin, culminating its nuclear accumulation, and subsequent activation of VEGF expression. Transfection of a stable form of β-catenin (S37A) or the use of a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor to stabilize β-catenin induced VEGF synthesis, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of β-catenin did not, confirming that the effect was β-catenin-specific. Using a luciferase reporter gene assay, we observed that Rg1 increased T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcriptional activity. These events were mediated via a PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of the inhibitory Ser9 residue of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In addition, the GR antagonist RU486 was able to inhibit Rg1-induced PI3K/Akt and β-catenin activation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism responsible for Rg1 functions. Ginseng, the root of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, has been a key component in Chinese traditional medicine for more than 1000 years. It is now one of the most extensively used alternative medicines throughout the world and appears in the pharmacopoeias of several countries, including the United States and Europe and employed for cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular concerns. In the United States, it was the second largest selling herbal supplement in 2001, with gross retail sales of U.S. $62 million (1Helms S. Altern. Med. Rev. 2004; 9: 259-274PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular components responsible for ginseng actions are ginsenosides, which are triterpene saponins that have a rigid steroidal skeleton with sugar moieties (2Liu C.X. Xiao P.G. J. Ethnopharmacol. 1992; 36: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Within more than 30 different ginsenosides, Rg1 is among the most abundant and active ingredients of P. ginseng (3Radad K. Gille G. Moldzio R. Saito H. Rausch W.D. Brain Res. 2004; 1021: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Rg1 has been reported to trigger transcriptional activation of glucocorticoid-responsive element-containing reporter gene, suggesting that Rg1 can activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 2The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DN, dominant negative.2The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DN, dominant negative.

Wong R.N.S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3211-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In prior work, Rg1 has been demonstrated to promote functional neovascularization into a polymer scaffold in vivo and the proliferation, chemoinvasion, and tubulogenesis of endothelial cell in vitro (6Liang H.C. Chen C.T. Chang Y. Huang Y.C. Chen S.C. Sung H.W. Tissue Eng. 2005; 11: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Sengupta S. Toh S.A. Sellers L.A. Skepper J.N. Koolwijk P. Leung H.W. Wong R.N. Sasisekharan R. Fan T.P. Circulation. 2004; 110: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although these data indicate that Rg1 can be used as a novel therapeutic modality for inducing angiogenesis, for example in wound healing and tissue regeneration, the downstream targets that transmit these proangiogenic effects are not clearly understood.Angiogenesis is the formation of capillaries as outgrowths from preexisting vasculature; it is a tightly regulated event integral to many physiological and pathological situations, including development, wound healing, and tumor growth (8Ferrara N. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is probably the most important angiogenesis inducer because of its potency, selectivity for endothelial cells, and ability to regulate key steps in angiogenesis, including proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (9Blazquez C. Gonzalez-Feria L. Alvarez L. Haro A. Llanos Casanova M. Guzman M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Overexpression of VEGF and its receptors promote blood vessel formation, and VEGF inhibition blocks angiogenesis (8Ferrara N. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of other angiogenic cytokines and growth factors act, at least in part, by up-regulating VEGF expression (10Seghezzi G. Patel S. Ren C.J. Gualandris A. Pintucci G. Robbins E.S. Shapiro R.L. Galloway A.C. Rifkin D.B. Mignatti P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1659-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar).Recent studies have implicated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vessel development in normal and pathological conditions (11Goodwin A.M. D'Amore P.A. Angiogenesis. 2002; 5: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Stability of β-catenin is a critical point in Wnt signaling that is regulated by many cytoplasmic proteins, including glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli. In the absence of Wnt, cytoplasmic β-catenin is constitutively degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Wnt signaling inhibits β-catenin degradation by inactivation of GSK3β as a result of phosphorylation at Ser9. As a result, β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus, where it interacts with T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) family transcription factors and regulates Wnt target genes (12Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated the expression of Wnt ligands and frizzled (Fz) receptors in vascular cells (11Goodwin A.M. D'Amore P.A. Angiogenesis. 2002; 5: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mice lacking Wnt-2 or Fz-5 display severe vascular abnormalities, including defective placental vasculature, and are embryonic lethal (13Ishikawa T. Tamai Y. Zorn A.M. Yoshida H. Seldin M.F. Nishikawa S. Taketo M.M. Development. 2001; 128: 25-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Monkley S.J. Delaney S.J. Pennisi D.J. Christiansen J.H. Wainwright B.J. Development. 1996; 122: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in human Fz-4 have been linked to familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, a hereditary disorder in which retinal angiogenesis is severely impaired (15Robitaille J. MacDonald M.L. Kaykas A. Sheldahl L.C. Zeisler J. Dube M.P. Zhang L.H. Singaraja R.R. Guernsey D.L. Zheng B. Siebert L.F. Hoskin-Mott A. Trese M.T. Pimstone S.N. Shastry B.S. Moon R.T. Hayden M.R. Goldberg Y.P. Samuels M.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is also frequently observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of vascular cells during angiogenesis and vessel remodeling in disease states (11Goodwin A.M. D'Amore P.A. Angiogenesis. 2002; 5: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The endothelial cell-specific, conditional inactivation of the β-catenin gene in mice leads to a defective vascular pattern, ultimately resulting in embryonic lethality (16Cattelino A. Liebner S. Gallini R. Zanetti A. Balconi G. Corsi A. Bianco P. Wolburg H. Moore R. Oreda B. Kemler R. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17Liebner S.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).In the present study, we sought to characterize the molecular mechanism by which Rg1 mediates VEGF expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We demonstrate a role for Rg1 in the regulation of VEGF expression, and this induction is through the activation of a PI3K/Akt → GSK3β → β-catenin-TCF pathway via the GR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExperimental Reagents—Ginsenoside-Rg1 is a reference compound (purity >98%) purchased from the Division of Chinese Material Medica and Natural Products, National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, Ministry of Public Health, China. A stock solution of Rg1 (50 mm) was prepared in sterile double distilled H2O. Medium 199, endothelial cell growth supplement, heparin, lithium chloride (LiCl), staurosporine, and the polyclonal anti-β-actin were purchased from Sigma. The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and the Akt inhibitor, SH-6, were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-β-catenin and anti-VEGF were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Biotinylated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and the PhosphoSensor kit were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, whereas growth factor-reduced Matrigel was obtained from BD Biosciences. The polyclonal phospho-specific antibodies to Akt (Ser473) and GSK3β (Ser9) and polyclonal anti-Akt and GSK3β were purchased from Cell Signaling, Inc. (Austin, TX). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated rabbit IgG was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA).Human β-catenin was first amplified from a cDNA library by PCR, and site-directed mutagenesis was then used to generate the activated mutant form of β-catenin (S37A). The PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing and subcloned into KpnI and BamHI sites of pEGFP expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide targeting β-catenin (18Wong A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1191-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and a nonspecific RNA control were obtained from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). Dominant negative Akt, the TCF-binding site reporter plasmid (TOPFLASH), and a mutated control reporter (FOPFLASH) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Constitutively active and dominant negative constructs of TCF were kindly provided by Dr. B. Gumbiner (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA).Cell Culture and Treatments—HUVEC was obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured in medium 199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 20 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 90 units/ml heparin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 95% air, 5% CO2. HUVEC between passages 2 and 8 were used in these studies to ensure the genetic stability of a culture. For inhibition assays, HUVEC was pretreated with inhibitors (10 μm LY294002, 10 μm SH-6, 10 mm LiCl, and 10 μm RU486) for 30 min before the addition of Rg1. Cell transfections were performed using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells transfected with siRNA duplex were incubated for 24 h prior to protein level determination or TCF reporter gene assay. To express cDNA construct, 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA was used per 35-mm dish.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—VEGF protein in cell lysates and conditioned media were quantified using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Assay Designs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). VEGF protein levels were determined by serial dilutions of recombinant VEGF165 standards assayed at the same time. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.Cell Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—The purification of membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear fractions of β-catenin was performed using a commercially available kit (Calbiochem) following the manufacturer's instructions. Calpain I and histone H1 antibodies were used to verify the separation of cytosolic and nuclear fractions, respectively. Protein concentration was determined using protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad. An equal quantity of proteins was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 3 h, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and revealed by an ECL detection system (Bio-Rad). Where indicated, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with another antibody. The density of the bands was quantified by densitometric analysis using Metamorph software.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNAs from HUVEC were extracted with TRIzol LS reagent (Sigma) and reverse transcribed using Superscript III First-strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen). The primers for human VEGF were 5′-CGA AAC CAT GAA CTT TCT GC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCT CAG TGG GCA CAC ACT CC-3′ (reverse), and primers for β-actin were 5′-GTG GGG CCG CTC TAG GCA C-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTT GAT GTC ACG CAC GAT TT-3′ (reverse), purchased from Invitrogen. The number of amplification cycles during which PCR product formation was limited by template concentration was determined in pilot experiments. Amplification of human VEGF and β-actin cDNA were carried out for 33 and 30 cycles, respectively, with PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen).Confocal Microscopy—Cells were grown on coverslips and treated with Rg1 in the presence or absence of inhibitors as described above. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted (1:100) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2% normal goat serum. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with fluorescence mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and viewed using a Zeiss LSM-510 multitracking laser-scanning confocal microscope (Frankfurt, Germany).TOPFLASH Luciferase Reporter Assay—In 6-well plates, cells were transiently transfected with 1.5 μg of the TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH reporter plasmid using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). As a control for transfection efficiency, 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase construct was included in each transfection. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and extracts were prepared in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the luciferase assay kit from Promega. Luciferase activity in each well was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. All experiments were assayed in triplicates, and the assay was performed in three independent experiments.Assay for PI3K Activity—PI3K activity was determined using the PhosphoSensor kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. This kit measures PI3K activity by quantifying the phosphorylation of PIP2. Cellular extracts of HUVEC untreated or treated with Rg1 (150 nm) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with biotinylated PIP2 (500 nm) and ATP (3 μm). Detection of phosphorylated PIP2 was performed by using fluorescent streptavidin conjugates and measuring the emission of fluorescence at 520 nm (iEMS analyzer; Labsystems). The addition of the generic protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (10 μm) was used to control for nonspecific background signal.Tube Formation Assay—HUVEC (1 × 105 cells/well) was seeded in a growth factor-reduced Matrigel-coated 24-well plate. Cells were untreated or treated with 150 nm Rg1 or with a combination of Rg1 and various dominant negative constructs or siRNAs for 16 h at 37 °C. Images were captured under phasecontrast microscopy (×10) using a CCD camera. Twelve microscopic fields were randomly selected for each well, and the number of tubelike structures per field was counted.Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was repeated at least three times, with each experiment yielding essentially identical results. Data were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were carried out by one-way analysis of variance, with Tukey's least significant difference t test for post hoc analysis (GraphPad software, San Diego). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSGinsenoside Rg1 Induces VEGF Production in HUVEC—Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that Rg1 increases neovascularization of endothelial cells (6Liang H.C. Chen C.T. Chang Y. Huang Y.C. Chen S.C. Sung H.W. Tissue Eng. 2005; 11: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Sengupta S. Toh S.A. Sellers L.A. Skepper J.N. Koolwijk P. Leung H.W. Wong R.N. Sasisekharan R. Fan T.P. Circulation. 2004; 110: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Because VEGF is known to be a key activator of angiogenesis, we examined whether VEGF is up-regulated by Rg1. We found that VEGF production was significantly elevated in response to Rg1 stimulation as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1). Moreover, VEGF was mainly secreted outside of the cell, since the concentration of VEGF in tissue culture medium was much higher than that in the cell lysate (Fig. 1). Treatment with increasing concentrations of Rg1 (50, 150, and 300 nm) increased the level of VEGF protein secretion by 38.0-, 41.2-, and 20.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 1A). In addition, the stimulatory effect of Rg1 on VEGF production in HUVEC was time-dependent. Elevated levels of VEGF were noted at 6 h, became more evident at 12 h, and peaked at 24 h following 150 nm Rg1 stimulation (Fig. 1B). To confirm these results, Western blot analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR for VEGF expression were also carried out using the antibodies and primers described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results confirmed the up-regulation of VEGF protein and mRNA after cells were exposed to 150 nm Rg1 for 24 h (Fig. 1C).Rg1-mediated Up-regulation of VEGF Involves Accumulation of β-Catenin—To uncover the molecular mechanisms for increased VEGF expression, we focused on signaling events that converge on β-catenin, which has an essential role in the regulation of angiogenesis (11Goodwin A.M. D'Amore P.A. Angiogenesis. 2002; 5: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). First, we examined the subcellular distribution of β-catenin in Rg1-treated HUVEC by Western blot analysis on fractionated membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear extracts. Although changes in membrane or cytosolic pools of β-catenin were not detected by this method, a significant amount of β-catenin appeared in the nucleus of HUVEC after 1 h of incubation with Rg1 (Fig. 2A). Equal loading of the membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear fractions were confirmed by the presence of VE-cadherin, calpain I, and histone H1, respectively (Fig. 2A). To verify this highly intriguing result, we used immunofluorescent microscopy to directly visualize the localization of β-catenin. As shown in Fig. 2B, strong staining of β-catenin in the nucleus was detected in >90% of the cells following treatment with Rg1, confirming the data from the fractionation experiment (Fig. 2A). Together, these data suggest that Rg1 induced rapid nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in HUVEC.FIGURE 2β-Catenin translocates into the nucleus upon Rg1 treatment. A (left), total, membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear fractions of protein lysates were isolated from HUVEC treated or untreated with 150 nm Rg1 for 1 h. Western blot was probed with antibodies against β-catenin. Equal loading for the membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear fractions was confirmed by the presence of VE-cadherin, calpain I, and histone H1, respectively. A (right), signal intensities were determined by densitometry. Data points shown represent the mean, with error bars representing S.D. (n = 3). *, p < 0.05 for Rg1-treated cells versus untreated control. B, β-catenin localization was detected by immunofluorescence with the anti-β-catenin antibody after cells were treated or untreated with Rg1 for 1 h. Micrographs were captured with a confocal microscope at ×20 and ×63 magnifications. N, nucleus. Scale bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since we observed that Rg1-induced accumulation of β-catenin correlated with VEGF expression, we asked whether a reduction of the amount of β-catenin by siRNA would affect VEGF expression. Endogenous β-catenin protein levels were efficiently and specifically reduced in the presence of a specific siRNA for β-catenin (Fig. 3A). No inhibition was observed for nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 3A). Importantly, expression of β-catenin siRNA, but not nonspecific siRNA, reverted the effects of Rg1 on VEGF protein expression (Fig. 3B), indicating that β-catenin was required for Rg1 stimulation of VEGF. Similar results were obtained by measuring VEGF mRNA levels (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3siRNA-mediated depletion of β-catenin suppresses VEGF expression. A, cell lysates of HUVEC transfected with 8 nm β-catenin (β-cat)-siRNA or nonspecific (NS)-siRNA were blotted with anti-β-catenin antibodies. Equal loading was confirmed by the presence of β-actin. B, cells were transfected with β-catenin-siRNA or nonspecific siRNA and post-treated with Rg1 for 24 h. Immunoblot analysis was performed using VEGF antibodies. Equal loading was confirmed by the presence of β-actin. C, reverse transcription-PCR was performed using VEGF sequence-specific primers. β-Actin was used as the internal control. Right, signal intensities were determined by densitometry. Data points shown represent the mean, with error bars representing S.D. (n = 3). *, significant differences from control, with p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β-Catenin Stimulates VEGF Expression in a TCF-dependent Manner—In the nucleus, accumulation of β-catenin allows interaction with the TCF/LEF transcription factors and up-regulation of target genes. Hence we studied the effect of Rg1 on the transcriptional activity of β-catenin-TCF. The luciferase reporters, which have a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and either wild type (TOPFLASH) or mutated (FOPFLASH) binding sites for the β-catenin-TCF complex, have been widely used to characterize β-catenin-TCF-dependent gene expression (19Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar) These reporter constructs were transfected into HUVEC, and luciferase activity was determined. The adenomatous polyposis coli mutant colorectal cancer cell line SW480 served as a positive control (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4A, HUVEC had low basal TCF transcriptional activities, and Rg1 treatment increased TOPFLASH activation by ∼2-fold.FIGURE 4Rg1 induces β-catenin-TCF transcriptional activation. A, HUVEC were transfected with 1.5 μg of either the TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH luciferase reporter constructs containing wild-type and mutated TCF binding sites, respectively, together with 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase for normalization of transfection efficiency. 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with Rg1. In some cases, TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH reporter constructs were transiently transfected with empty vector or vector expressing dominant negative TCF (DN-TCF) or constitutively active TCF (VP16-TCF) into HUVEC. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. Values are normalized luciferase activity (TOPFLASH activity minus the activity devoted to FOPFLASH and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity) and are shown as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. B (left), in parallel experiments, the expression of VEGF was shown by immunoblotting of total cell lysates of transfected HUVEC cells using antibodies to VEGF. β-Actin served as a loading control. B (right), signal intensities were determined by densitometry. Data points shown represent the mean, with error bars representing S.D. (n = 3). *, significant differences from control, with p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further test if β-catenin-TCF complex formation is necessary for mediating Rg1 effects, we utilized a dominant negative mutant of TCF (DN-TCF) that effectively blocks β-catenin-mediated TCF-dependent transcription (20Vonica A. Wong W. Gumbiner B.M. Venuti J.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 230-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, expression of DN-TCF repressed the stimulatory ability of Rg1 upon VEGF expression. On the other hand, expression of an activated mutant of TCF (VP16-TCF) (20Vonica A. Wong W. Gumbiner B.M. Venuti J.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 230-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) produced similar activation on VEGF expression as Rg1 (Fig. 4B). We also confirmed the effectiveness of these constructs to modulate TCF activity in HUVEC by measuring TOPFLASH reporter activation (Fig. 4A). These findings suggest that the Rg1 effects are attributable to changes in β-catenin-TCF nuclear signaling.Rg1 Treatment Induces Phosphorylation of GSK3β in a PI3K/Akt-dependent Manner—The results of Fig. 2 indicated that β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus was rapid (∼1 h) in response to Rg1 treatment, suggesting that the Rg1-induced β-catenin nuclear translocation in HUVEC is likely to be due to β-catenin stabilization rather than transcription induction. GSK3β is known to phosphorylate β-catenin on N-terminal serine residues, targeting β-catenin for rapid ubiquination and proteasome-mediated degradation (21Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Conversely, inactivation of GSK3β by phosphorylation promotes β-catenin protein stability and transactivation activity. We therefore investigated whether Rg1-mediated β-catenin up-regulation involves changes in GSK3β phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 5A, the level of Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β was increased significantly after Rg1 treatment. Notably, Rg1 stimulation caused a parallel increase in the cellular level of β-catenin and subsequent VEGF expression (Fig. 5A). Treatment with LiCl, a pharmacological agent well known for its inhibitory effect on GSK3β activity (22Isner J.M. Asahara T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1231-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 23Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enhanced the cellular level of β-catenin and VEGF expression (Fig. 5A). Next, we asked whether expression of a constitutively active mutant of β-catenin (S37A) that is refractory to proteasomal degradation (24Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) could increase VEGF. Fig. 5B shows that the expression of S37A β-catenin increased β-catenin levels (2.7-fold), TOPFLASH activity (1.8-fold; data not shown), and VEGF expression (2.3-fold) to similar levels as Rg1 treatme"
https://openalex.org/W1979366690,"Acyl carrier proteins play a central role in metabolism by transporting substrates in a wide variety of pathways including the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. However, despite their importance, there is a paucity of direct structural information concerning the interaction of ACPs with enzymes in these pathways. Here we report the structure of an acyl-ACP substrate bound to the <i>Escherichia coli</i> fatty acid biosynthesis enoyl reductase enzyme (FabI), based on a combination of x-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulation. The structural data are in agreement with kinetic studies on wild-type and mutant FabIs, and reveal that the complex is primarily stabilized by interactions between acidic residues in the ACP helix α2 and a patch of basic residues adjacent to the FabI substrate-binding loop. Unexpectedly, the acyl-pantetheine thioester carbonyl is not hydrogen-bonded to Tyr<sup>156</sup>, a conserved component of the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily active site triad. FabI is a proven target for drug discovery and the present structure provides insight into the molecular determinants that regulate the interaction of ACPs with target proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1988715974,"Three highly homologous small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) proteins have been identified in mammals. Modifications of proteins by SUMO-1 have been shown to regulate transcription, nucleocytoplasmic transport, protein stability, and protein-protein interactions. Relative to SUMO-1, little is known about the functions of SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 (referred to as SUMO-2/3). Here, stable cell lines overexpressing processed forms of SUMO-2/3 (SUMO-2/3GG) as well as their non-conjugatable derivatives, SUMO-2/3ΔGG, were established. Cells overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG showed a premature senescence phenotype as revealed by cellular morphology and senescence-associated galactosidase activity. The senescence pathway protein p21 was up-regulated in cells overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG. In contrast, cells overexpressing non-conjugatable forms of SUMO-2/3ΔGG showed neither an apparent senescent phenotype nor elevated p21. Both p53 and pRB were found to be modified by SUMO-2/3. Site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that Lys-386 of p53, the SUMO-1 modification site, is also the modification site for SUMO-2/3. In addition, H2O2 treatment of untransfected cells caused an increase in p53 sumoylation by SUMO-2/3, whereas that by SUMO-1 remained unchanged. Moreover, knocking down tumor suppressor proteins p53 or pRB using small interfering RNA significantly alleviated the premature senescence phenotypes in SUMO-2/3GG overexpressing cells. Together, our results reveal that p53 and pRB can be sumoylated by SUMO-2/3 in vivo, and such modification of p53 and pRB may play roles in premature senescence and stress response. Three highly homologous small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) proteins have been identified in mammals. Modifications of proteins by SUMO-1 have been shown to regulate transcription, nucleocytoplasmic transport, protein stability, and protein-protein interactions. Relative to SUMO-1, little is known about the functions of SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 (referred to as SUMO-2/3). Here, stable cell lines overexpressing processed forms of SUMO-2/3 (SUMO-2/3GG) as well as their non-conjugatable derivatives, SUMO-2/3ΔGG, were established. Cells overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG showed a premature senescence phenotype as revealed by cellular morphology and senescence-associated galactosidase activity. The senescence pathway protein p21 was up-regulated in cells overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG. In contrast, cells overexpressing non-conjugatable forms of SUMO-2/3ΔGG showed neither an apparent senescent phenotype nor elevated p21. Both p53 and pRB were found to be modified by SUMO-2/3. Site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that Lys-386 of p53, the SUMO-1 modification site, is also the modification site for SUMO-2/3. In addition, H2O2 treatment of untransfected cells caused an increase in p53 sumoylation by SUMO-2/3, whereas that by SUMO-1 remained unchanged. Moreover, knocking down tumor suppressor proteins p53 or pRB using small interfering RNA significantly alleviated the premature senescence phenotypes in SUMO-2/3GG overexpressing cells. Together, our results reveal that p53 and pRB can be sumoylated by SUMO-2/3 in vivo, and such modification of p53 and pRB may play roles in premature senescence and stress response. The amino acid sequence of the small ubiquitin-modifier (SUMO) 2The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-related modifier; pRB, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SA-β-Gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase; E1, E1 is ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. 2The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-related modifier; pRB, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SA-β-Gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase; E1, E1 is ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. is only 18% identical to that of ubiquitin, but its three-dimensional structure is very similar to ubiquitin. SUMO is attached to its target proteins by an enzymic mechanism that is analogous to the ubiquitinylation pathway (1Gill G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem.

The mammalian SUMO family consists of SUMO-1, -2, and -3. Human SUMO-1 (SMT3C) exhibits 46% sequence identity with SUMO-2 (SMT3A) and SUMO-3 (SMT3B), whereas SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are 96% identical in their processed forms; thus SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are referred as SUMO-2/3 (4Johnson S.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 has been found to covalently modify >70 target proteins. Many of them are important regulatory proteins, such as p53, IκBα, c-Jun, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (5Ulrich H.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 525-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The functions of SUMO-1 conjugation are target-specific and highly diverse. Sumoylation may be involved in the regulation of transcription, nucleocytoplasmic transport, DNA repair, protein stability, and chromosome separation (1Gill G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Unlike SUMO-1, SUMO-2/3 can form polysumoylation chains due to their sequences containing the intrinsic SUMO consensus sequence ψKXE, where ψ stands for a large hydrophobic amino acid residue (7Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Another important difference between SUMO-2/3 and SUMO-1 conjugation pathways in mammalian cells is that the majority of SUMO-1 exists in the conjugated forms, whereas SUMO-2/3 exist primarily as free forms and readily conjugate to substrates under certain stresses (8Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In contrast to the large number of identified SUMO-1 target proteins, only a few SUMO-2/3-modified proteins have been reported. The physiological functions of SUMO-2/3 are not well understood.Cellular premature senescence is a program triggered by cells in response to various types of stresses, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and oncogene activation (9Campisi J. Exp. Gerontol. 2003; 38: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Cells entering senescence undergo permanent cell cycle arrest with a set of functional and morphological changes. The cellular signals activated by the stresses are funneled to p53 and pRB, which determine whether cells enter senescence (10Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar, 11Okada H. Mak T.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Accordingly, most genes found to regulate senescence (i.e. p21 and p16INK4a) can be placed upstream or downstream of p53 or pRB in the signaling pathways (12Ben-Porath I. Weinberg R.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 37: 961-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). p53 can be modified with SUMO-1 at lysine 386, and the sumoylation of p53 enhances its transcriptional activity (13Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 14Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Most recently, pRB was also found to be modified by SUMO-1, and its activity was regulated by sumoylation (16Ledl A. Schmidt D. Muller S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3810-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because p53 and pRB as well as SUMO-2/3 (but not SUMO-1) are involved in cellular stress responses, it is of interest to determine whether SUMO-2/3 can modify p53 and pRB as a possible regulatory mechanism in cellular senescence.To further investigate the physiological functions of SUMO-2/3, we developed stable HEK293 Tet-On cell lines overexpressing Myc-His-SUMO-2/3GG and Myc-His-SUMO-2/3ΔGG. Our results reveal that p53 and pRB are modified by SUMO-2/3, and premature cellular senescence also occurs in cells overexpressing SUMO-2/3. Furthermore, H2O2 induced p53 modification by SUMO-2/3 in untransfected HEK293 cells. These findings provide new insights into the potential regulatory role of sumoylation in cellular senescence in response to oxidative stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies, Plasmids, and Mutagenesis—The monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10), anti-SUMO-1, anti-RanGAP1, anti-p53 (DO-1) antibodies, agarose-conjugated anti-Myc, and anti-p53 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, monoclonal anti-HA and anti-β-actin antibodies from Sigma, monoclonal anti-p21 and anti-pRB antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology, and polyclonal anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody from Abcam. The cDNAs encoding the processed forms of SUMO-1 (1-97), SUMO-2 (1-92), and SUMO-3 (1-93) with Gly-Gly at their C termini were amplified by PCR. His6 tag sequences immediately upstream of the start codons of the SUMO-1/2/3 sequences were designed in the amplifying primers. The PCR-amplified cDNAs were inserted into the pTRE2hyg2-Myc vector (Clontech) as NheI/ClaI fragments to generate pTRE2hyg2-Myc-His-SUMO-1/2/3GG plasmids. The pTRE2hyg2-Myc-His-SUMO-2/3ΔGG plasmids harboring non-conjugatable SUMO-2 (1-90) and SUMO-3 (1-91) sequences, lacking the C-terminal Gly-Gly, were similarly constructed. The wild-type p53 cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pTRE2pur-HA (Clontech) as a MluI/ClaI fragment to generate the pTRE2pur-HA-p53WT plasmid. The pTRE2pur-HA-p53K386R (where Lys-386 is replaced by Arg) plasmid was constructed as described above using a 3′ primer specifically designed with the corresponding mutation. The p53 response reporter plasmids pRGC-Luc and pG13-Luc, were generous gifts from Dr. Seung J. Baek (University of Tennessee) and Dr. Ronald T. Hay (University of St. Andrews), respectively.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Lines—The stable HEK293 Tet-On or mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) 3T3 Tet-Off cell lines overexpressing Myc-His-SUMO-1/2/3GG and Myc-His-SUMO-2/3ΔGG were established using the protocol previously described (17Li T. Evdokimov E. Shen R.F. Chao C.C. Tekle E. Wang T. Stadtman E.R. Yang D.C. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) was used for transient transfection.Purification of His6-tagged SUMO Substrates—The His6-tagged proteins were purified under denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA-agarose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) with some modifications. Briefly, after induction with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h, 1 × 108 cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (6 m guanidinium-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 20 mm iodoacetamide). The clarified cell lysates were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice for 2 min each time with 0.5 ml of each of the following buffers: lysis buffer A, washing buffer A (8 m urea, pH 8.0, 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide), and washing buffer B (8 m urea, pH 6.3, 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.2% Triton X-100). For Western blotting, the His6-tagged proteins were eluted by boiling Ni-NTA-agarose beads in 2× NuPAGE sample buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Proteins were resolved by 4-12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and probed with specific antibodies.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) to obtain whole cell extracts. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (17Li T. Evdokimov E. Shen R.F. Chao C.C. Tekle E. Wang T. Stadtman E.R. Yang D.C. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The whole cell extracts from stable cell lines overexpressing SUMO-1/2/3GG were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously (17Li T. Evdokimov E. Shen R.F. Chao C.C. Tekle E. Wang T. Stadtman E.R. Yang D.C. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).p53 Transcriptional Transactivation Activity Assay—For the pRGC-Luc and pG13-Luc p53 response reporter plasmids, transfection was used to assess the transcriptional activity of p53 in vivo. The luciferase activity was determined with the Luciferase reporter assay kit (BioVision) using a Turner Design luminometer (Promega). The values obtained were normalized with protein concentration in each sample.Senescence-associated Galactosidase Assays—The senescence-associated expression of β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity was monitored using a senescence detection kit (BioVision).RNA Interference—The human p53 siRNA, human pRB siRNA, or control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was transfected into SUMO-2GG or SUMO-3GG stable cells using siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSEnhancement of SUMO-2/3 Conjugations in Cells Expressing SUMO-2/3—Unlike SUMO-1, SUMO-2/3 are present mainly in their free forms instead of conjugated forms under normal conditions, and the conjugation of SUMO-2/3 increases significantly after certain stress conditions, such as heat shock and oxidative stress (8Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines overexpressing the processed forms of SUMO-2/3 (Myc-His-SUMO-2/3GG) and their non-conjugatable mutants (Myc-His-SUMO-2/3ΔGG) were established to analyze the consequences of the increased levels of SUMO-2/3 conjugation during stresses. As shown in Fig. 1, Myc-His-SUMO-2/3GG (abbreviated as SUMO-2/3GG) and Myc-His-SUMO-2/3ΔGG (abbreviated as SUMO-2/3ΔGG) were successfully expressed in the respective cell lines. A large number of high molecular weight sumoylated proteins and unconjugated SUMO-2/3 was detected by probing with either anti-Myc or anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody in cells expressing SUMO-2/3GG. The expression level of SUMO-2GG was apparently higher than that of SUMO-3GG, correlating with the higher level of sumoylated proteins observed by anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody in SUMO-2GG cells (Fig. 1). However, only unconjugated SUMO-2/3 were detected by anti-Myc antibody, and the level of endogenous sumoylated high molecular weight proteins detected by anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody is relatively low in cells expressing SUMO-2/3ΔGG (Fig. 1). This observation indicates that epitope-tagged SUMO-2/3GG are functional in cells, and high molecular weight proteins revealed by Western blotting are sumoylated proteins.The Patterns of Proteins Modified by SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 Are Similar but Different from That of SUMO-1—As shown in Fig. 2A, the majority of SUMO-1 is conjugated to the target proteins, whereas appreciable amounts of SUMO-2/3 are present in free forms. SUMO-1 modification apparently did not respond to H2O2 treatment; in contrast, SUMO-2/3 conjugates increased significantly after cells were treated with H2O2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2). These results are consistent with a previous report (8Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Western blot analysis using anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody revealed that RanGAP1, the most abundant SUMO-1 substrate, was modified by SUMO-2/3. This sumoylation of RanGAP1 was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-RanGAP1 antibody (Fig. 2A, lanes 3). The global patterns of SUMO target proteins by different SUMO paralogues were further characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2B, the overall sumoylation patterns between SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are apparently similar, indicating that SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 may target the same proteins with similar intensity. In contrast, SUMO-1 modified many neutral proteins and fewer high molecular weight proteins. These results indicate that SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 have different substrate preferences that may function specifically under distinct conditions.FIGURE 2The sumoylation patterns of SUMO-1/2/3 in HEK293 cells. A, 10 μg of the whole cell lysate of HEK293 cells (lanes 1), 10 μg of the whole cell lysate of HEK293 cells treated with 5 μm H2O2 for 20 min at 37 °C (lanes 2), and anti-RanGAP1 immunoprecipitate from 200 μg of the whole cell lysate of HEK293 cells (lanes 3) were resolved using NuPAGE gels and probed with anti-SUMO-1 or anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody, respectively. The two dark bands below the SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 (lanes 3) are the heavy and light chains of anti-RanGAP antibody used in immunoprecipitation. B, 10 μg of the whole cell lysates from HEK293 Tet-On cells stably expressing Myc-His-tagged SUMO-1GG, SUMO-2GG, or SUMO-3GG were resolved using 7-cm two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and probed with anti-Myc antibody. Arrows indicate sumoylated RanGAP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overexpressing Processed Forms of SUMO-2/3-induced Senescence—Interestingly, cells overexpressing processed forms of SUMO-2/3 (SUMO-2/3GG) were found to grow slowly. Furthermore, many enlarged and flattened cells, a morphology commonly observed in senescent cells, were observed in the cells overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG (Fig. 3). Such a phenotype was not observed in cells overexpressing non-conjugatable forms of SUMO-2/3 (SUMO-2/3ΔGG). The SA-β-Gal activity was measured to confirm whether cells exhibiting the senescent morphology were indeed in senescence. As shown in Fig. 3, many senescent cells, stained blue due to SA-β-Gal activity, were found among cells overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG, but hardly any were found among cells overexpressing SUMO-2/3ΔGG. These results suggest that elevated cellular SUMO-2/3 modification levels in cells expressing SUMO-2/3GG may interfere with cell growth by inducing senescence. This unexpected observation with the immortal HEK293 cells was further confirmed in MEF 3T3 cells, a cell line typically used in senescence study. As shown in Fig. 3, overexpression of SUMO-2/3 also caused these cells to become enlarged and flattened, exhibiting SA-β-Gal activity.FIGURE 3The SA-β-Gal assay for processed and non-conjugatable SUMO-2/3 stable expression cells. The SA-β-Gal activity of HEK293 Tet-On cells or MEF 3T3 Tet-Off cells stably expressing Myc-His-SUMO-2/3GG or Myc-His-SUMO-2/3ΔGG was detected using a senescence detection kit (BioVision). The arrows indicate enlarged and flattened cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Knocking Down p53 or pRB Significantly Alleviated Senescence Phenotype—The tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRB are two major regulatory proteins known to mediate premature cellular senescence. We wondered whether knocking down these proteins would alleviate the effects of overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG-induced senescence. As shown in Fig. 4A, when cells overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG were transfected with either p53 siRNA or pRB siRNA for 48 h, cellular p53 or pRB protein level was reduced to about one-third of that observed in cells transfected with a control siRNA consisting of a non-targeting 20-25-nt RNA sequence. Furthermore, the senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity was significantly reduced in p53 or pRB knock-down cells (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the SUMO-2/3-induced premature cellular senescence is dependent on both p53 and pRB pathways.FIGURE 4Knocking down p53 or pRB in SUMO-2/3GG stable expression cells. A, HEK293 cells stably expressing SUMO-2/3GG were transfected with human p53 siRNA, pRB siRNA, or control (Contl) siRNA and cultured for 48 h. Whole cell extracts were resolved using NuPAGE gels and probed with anti-pRB, anti-p53, or anti-β-actin, respectively. β-actin was used to show equal loading of whole cell extracts. B, the SA-β-Gal activities of siRNA-transfected cells were assayed using a senescence detection kit (BioVision).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p53 and pRB Are Modified by SUMO-2/3—The His6-tagged sumoylated proteins from SUMO-2/3GG and SUMO-2/3ΔGG overexpressing cells were purified using Ni-NTA-agarose and probed with anti-RanGAP1, anti-p53, or anti-pRB antibodies, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, protein bands corresponding to the sizes of the monosumoylated RanGAP1, p53, and pRB were observed in cells expressing SUMO-2/3GG but not in those expressing SUMO-2/3ΔGG. These results indicate that RanGAP1, p53, and pRB can be modified by SUMO-2/3. Interestingly, some slower migrated bands corresponding to polysumoylated p53 were also found, implying that p53 might be polysumoylated by SUMO-2/3.FIGURE 5The modification of p53 and pRB by SUMO-2/3. After 48 h of incubation with 2 μg/ml doxycycline, whole cell extracts from HEK293 cells stably expressing SUMO-2/3GG or SUMO-2/3 ΔGG were purified using Ni-NTA-agarose beads and probed with anti-RanGAP1, anti-p53, or anti-pRB as indicated. The solid arrows indicate the band corresponding to the size of monosumoylated target proteins. The open arrow indicates the bands corresponding to the sizes of polysumoylated proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Sumoylation Site of p53 by SUMO-2/3 Has Been Identified to be Lys-386—To determine whether SUMO-2/3 also conjugates to p53 at Lys-386, HA-tagged wild-type p53 (p53WT) and HA-tagged mutant p53 (p53K386R) were transiently expressed in cells stably overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG (13Gostissa M.

When His6-tagged SUMO-2/3-conjugated proteins were isolated using Ni-NTA-agarose and analyzed by Western blot with anti-HA antibody, only p53 WT (but not p53K386R) was found to co-purify with His6-tagged SUMO-2/3-conjugated proteins (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that SUMO-2/3 and SUMO-1 share the same conjugating site, Lys-386, in p53. However, no polysumoylated p53 was observed, likely because of the limited expression level of HA-tagged p53.FIGURE 6Modification of p53 by SUMO-2/3 at lysine 386 and its response to H2O2. A, HEK293 cells stably expressing SUMO-2/3GG were transfected with pTRE2pur-HA-p53WT or pTRE2pur-HA-p53K386R plasmid. His-tagged SUMO-2/3-conjugated proteins were purified using Ni-NTA-agarose beads and probed with anti-HA antibody. The whole cell extracts (WCE) were used to show equal loading. B, HEK293 cells were incubated with 5 μm H2O2 for 20 min at 37 °C, and the whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibody. The precipitates were probed with anti-SUMO-1 or anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody. The arrows indicate the band corresponding to the size of monosumoylated p53.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Oxidative Stress Stimulated p53 Sumoylation by SUMO-2/3 but Not SUMO-1—It has been reported that sumoylation by SUMO-2/3 (but not SUMO-1) responds to a number of stress conditions, e.g. heat shock and oxidative stress (8Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, when untransfected HEK293 cells were treated with 5 μm H2O2 for 20 min at 37 °C, the SUMO-2/3-modified p53 was elevated from an undetectable level to a clearly visible level in Western analysis monitored by anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody. However, no polysumoylated p53 was detected under these conditions. This observation is likely because of the presence of the relatively low abundance of modified p53. On the other hand, the level of SUMO-1-modified p53 exhibited no noticeable change following H2O2 treatment (Fig. 6B).Increase of p53 Transcriptional Activation by Modification with SUMO-2/3—To assess the functional changes of p53 in cells resulting from SUMO-2/3 modification, reporter gene constructs containing binding sites for p53 at the promoter regions were used to analyze the transcriptional activity of p53. When stable cell lines were transfected with the pRGC-Luc p53 reporter plasmid, the luciferase activity in cells expressing SUMO-2GG was found to be elevated ∼4-fold over those expressing SUMO-2ΔGG. Similarly, luciferase activity in cells expressing SUMO-3GG was ∼2-fold over those expressing SUMO-3ΔGG. In contrast, both SUMO-2ΔGG- and SUMO-3ΔGG-transfected cell lines showed similarly low levels of luciferase activity (Fig. 7). Similar results were also observed when pG13-Luc was used as the p53 reporter plasmid or when MEF 3T3 Tet-Off cells were co-transfected with pRGC-Luc, p53WT, and the four SUMO-2/3 constructs (data not shown). In addition, p21, which is a direct target of p53, was induced in cells overexpressing SUMO-2/3 but not in those overexpressing the non-conjugatable SUMO-2/3ΔGG (Fig. 1). These findings suggest that overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG elevates the p53 sumoylation level, which in turn stimulates p53 transcriptional activity.FIGURE 7The stimulation of p53 transcriptional activity by overexpressing SUMO-2/3. Shown are HEK293 Tet-On cells stably expressing SUMO-2ΔGG (1), SUMO-2GG (2), SUMO-3ΔGG (3), or SUMO-3GG (4) transfected with pRGC-luc, a p53-response reporter plasmid, 1 μg/well in a 12-well plate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, luciferase reporter activity was assayed, and the values obtained were normalized by protein concentration in each sample.

Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), it is of interest to identify SUMO-2/3 target proteins and to investigate the consequences of these modifications. In this study, stable cell lines overexpressing SUMO-2/3GG were used to serve as models for evaluating the effects of the elevated level of SUMO-2/3 modification under stress conditions. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, the overall SUMO-2/3GG conjugation patterns, except for the elevation of conjugation levels, are similar to endogenous SUMO-2/3 conjugation patterns in cells expressing non-conjugatable SUMO-2/3ΔGG. These results indicate that our stable cell lines could serve as suitable models mimicking the stress-induced elevation of SUMO-2/3 conjugation. We showed clearly that RanGAP1, the most abundant substrate of SUMO-1, is also sumoylated by SUMO-2/3 at their endogenous levels in HEK293 cells. (Fig. 2A) and that overexpression of SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 significantly elevated the level of SUMO-2/3-modified RanGAP1 (Fig. 1). This finding is different from a previous report that SUMO-2/3 conjugated poorly, if at all, to RanGAP1 (8Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The discrepancy could result from the facts that COS-7 cells, which contain h"
https://openalex.org/W2117068772,"Rickettsiae are well known as intracellular pathogens of animals, humans, and plants and facultative and unorganized symbionts of invertebrates. No close relative of mitochondria has yet been associated with nutritional or developmental dependency of its host cell or organism. We have found a mycetomic Rickettsia that is a strict obligatory symbiont of the parthenogenetic booklouse Liposcelis bostrychophila (Psocoptera). These rickettsiae show an evolutionary transition from a solitary to a primary mycetomic bacterium adapted to the development of its host. These intracellular and intranuclear bacteria reside in specialized cells in several tissues. Their distribution changes markedly with the development of their host. The most advanced phenotype is a paired mycetome in the abdomen, described for the first time for Rickettsia and this host order. The mycetomic rickettsiae of two parthenogenetic book lice species are in the spotted fever group and in the basal limoniae group. While mycetomic bacteria are well known for their metabolic or light-emitting functions, these rickettsiae have an essential role in the early development of the oocyte. Removal of the Rickettsia stops egg production and reproduction in the book louse. In two phylogenetically distant psocopteran species, Rickettsia are shown to be associated with four transitional stages from free bacteria, infected cells, through single mycetocytes to organ-forming mycetomes."

The lungs of sPLA2-V Tg mice exhibited atelectasis with thickened alveolar walls and narrow air spaces, accompanied by infiltration of macrophages and only modest changes in eicosanoid levels. This severe pulmonary defect in sPLA2-V Tg mice was attributable to marked reduction of the lung surfactant phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol. Given that the expression of sPLA2-V is greatly elevated in human lungs with severe inflammation, our present results raise the intriguing possibility that this isozyme may contribute to ongoing surfactant hydrolysis often observed in the lungs of patients with respiratory distress syndrome. In contrast, sPLA2-X Tg neonates displayed minimal abnormality of the respiratory tract with normal alveolar architecture and surfactant composition. This unexpected result was likely because sPLA2-X protein existed as an inactive zymogen in most tissues. The active form of sPLA2-X was detected in tissues with inflammatory granulation in sPLA2-X Tg mice.

However, the proposed roles of sPLA2 enzymes have largely been inferred from their enzymatic and biochemical properties, the effects of their overexpression or exogenous addition in in vitro experimental settings, or the use of pharmacological inhibitors (whose specificity may not be strictly defined). Given the complexity and diversity of the PLA2 family, transgenic (Tg) overexpression (gain-of-function) and gene targeting (loss-of-function) strategies seem to be more appropriate for elucidating the functions of individual enzymes in vivo.

In this study, we generated Tg mice overexpressing sPLA2-V or sPLA2-X, the two most potent PC-hydrolyzing isozymes, in an effort to search for their suitable substrates in vivo. We found that all sPLA2-V Tg neonates died within several hours after birth because of respiratory failure. This severe, lethal phenotype of sPLA2-V Tg mice is attributable to aberrant hydrolysis of lung surfactant phospholipids, an event that has often been observed in the lungs of patients with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In contrast, sPLA2-X Tg mice do not display such detrimental lung damage, because sPLA2-X exists as an inactive zymogen in most tissues under physiological conditions. Proteolytic activation of sPLA2-X in vivo occurs in particular situations such as inflammation. Generation of sPLA2 Tg Mice—All mice were housed in climate-controlled (21 °C) specific pathogen-free facilities with a 12-h light-dark cycle, with free access to standard laboratory food (Picolab mouse diet 20; Laboratory Diet, Brentwood, MO) and water. All procedures involving animals were performed according to protocols approved by the faculties. The strategy for the generation of sPLA2 Tg mice is illustrated in Fig. 1A. The cDNA for mouse sPLA2-V or human sPLA2-X was inserted into the EcoRI site of the pCALNL5 vector (52Kanegae Y. Takamori K. Sato Y. Lee G. Nakai M. Saito I. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The plasmid, in which the transgene was flanked downstream of a neomycin cassette with LoxP sites at both ends, was excised at the HindIII and SalI sites to produce a 5.1-kb CAG-loxP-neor-loxP-sPLA2 (LNL-sPLA2) fragment. Female 6-8-week-old C57BL/6 mice (Japan SLC) were treated with 5 units of horse gonadotropin (Teikokuzoki Pharmaceutical) and 48 h later with 5 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (Teikokuzoki Pharmaceutical) and then mated with male C57BL/6 mice. The purified LNL-sPLA2 fragment was microinjected into 0.5-day fertilized eggs using a micromanipulator (Nikon), and the eggs were transferred to the fimbriae of uterine tubes in female ICR mice (Japan SLC) that had been mated with vasoligated male mice the previous day. The tails (5 mm in length) of the pups (4-week-old) were cut off and lysed in 500 μl of tissue lysis buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) at 55 °C overnight. DNA was purified from the lysates using an automated DNA isolation system (NA-2000; Kurabo Industries), and aliquots were taken for PCR for genotyping (see below). Male founders were mated with female C57BL/mice to confirm germ line transmission by PCR genotyping, and those with successful germ line transmission were then crossed with female CAG-Cre Tg mice, which carry the Cre recombinase transgene under the control of the ubiquitously active cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer-chicken β-actin hybrid (CAG) promoter (53Sakai K. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 54Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). This step resulted in removal of the neor cassette from the LNL-sPLA2 transgene, thereby allowing activation of the sPLA2-V or sPLA2-X transgene in the whole body of the offspring (sPLA2 Tg mice) (Fig. 1). As required, the male founders were mated with female pgk2-Cre Tg mice, in which the transcription of the Cre recombinase transgene was controlled by the spermatogenic cell-specific promoter pgk2, allowing generation of the testis-specific sPLA2 Tg mice (55Kido T. Arata S. Suzuki R. Hosono T. Nakanishi Y. Miyazaki J. Saito I. Kuroki T. Shioda S. Dev. Growth Differ. 2005; 47: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All the sPLA2 Tg mice were inbred with C57BL/6 mice. PCR Genotyping—Approximately 0.1 μg of genomic DNA obtained from the mouse tails was subjected to PCR amplification with ExTaq polymerase (Takara Biomedicals) and a set of primers of CAG-F1 (5′-CTGCTAACCATGTTCATGCC-3′) and CAGV-R1 (5′-CATTCTTCCTGGTCACCTTC-3′) (for sPLA2-V Tg mice) or CAG-F1 and CAGX-R1 (5′-GGGCTAAGCAGTTAGCAATC-3′) (for sPLA2-X Tg mice). The PCR primers were obtained from Fasmac. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 5 min and then 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 3 min on a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. Northern Blotting—Equal amounts (∼10 μg) of total RNA obtained from tissues by use of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) were applied to separate lanes of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then probed with appropriate cDNA probes that had been labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by random priming (Takara Biomedicals). Hybridization and subsequent membrane washing were carried out as described previously (14Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F.

RT-PCR—Synthesis of cDNA was performed using 0.5 μg of total RNA from tissues and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, according to the manufacturer's instructions supplied with the RNA PCR kit (Takara Biomedicals). Subsequent amplification of the cDNA fragments was performed using 0.5 μl of the reverse-transcribed mixture as a template with specific primers (23-bp oligonucleotide primers corresponding to 5′- and 3′-nucleotide sequences of the open reading frame) for mouse sPLA2-V. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s and then 35 cycles of amplification at 94 °C for 5 s and 68 °C for 4 min, using the Advantage cDNA polymerase mix (Clontech). RT-PCR for β-actin as a control was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. Immunoblotting—Tissues (100 mg) were soaked in 500 μl of SET buffer comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and then homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer and sonicator. The homogenates (20 μg of protein equivalents) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 13% gels under reducing conditions with 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentrations in the samples were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) with a semi-dry blotter (Transblot SD; Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% (w/v) skim milk in TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membranes were probed with rabbit antibody against each sPLA2 at 1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T for 2 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T for 2 h, and then visualized using the ECL Western blot system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described previously (14Murakami M.

Measurement of sPLA2 Activity—sPLA2 activities in tissue homogenates were assayed by measuring the amounts of radiolabeled linoleic acid or AA released from the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-PC (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The substrate in ethanol was dried under a N2 stream and dispersed in water by sonication. Each reaction mixture (total volume 250 μl) consisted of appropriate amounts of the required samples, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm CaCl2, and 2 μmol of substrate. After incubation for 30-60 min at 37 °C, [14C]linoleic acid or [14C]AA was extracted, and the radioactivity was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter, as described previously (14Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Plethysmography—Respiration monitoring of embryonic Tg mice (E18.5) obtained by cesarean section was carried out by whole-body plethysmography (56Kuwaki T. Cao W.H. Kurihara Y. Kurihara H. Ling G.Y. Onodera M. Ju K.H. Yazaki Y. Kumada M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 1279-1286PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, we used a small glass chamber that was connected to one side of a differential pressure transducer (TP602T; Nihon Kohden). The measured pressure signal was amplified with a DC amplifier (AR601G; Nihon Kohden). At the time of measurement, the chamber was sealed, and instantaneous pressure within the chamber with reference to ambient pressure was measured by a pressure transducer. Respiratory frequency, tidal volume, and minute volume were calculated from 50 to 70 respiratory cycles during quiet breathing. Histochemistry—Immunohistochemistry of mouse tissue sections was performed as described previously (57Masuda S. Murakami M. Matsumoto S. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T.

https://openalex.org/W2018296945,"We characterized the human Na+-ascorbic acid transporter SVCT2 and developed a basic model for the transport cycle that challenges the current view that it functions as a Na+-dependent transporter. The properties of SVCT2 are modulated by Ca2+/Mg2+ and a reciprocal functional interaction between Na+ and ascorbic acid that defines the substrate binding order and the transport stoichiometry. Na+ increased the ascorbic acid transport rate in a cooperative manner, decreasing the transport Km without affecting the Vmax, thus converting a low affinity form of the transporter into a high affinity transporter. Inversely, ascorbic acid affected in a bimodal and concentration-dependent manner the Na+ cooperativity, with absence of cooperativity at low and high ascorbic acid concentrations. Our data are consistent with a transport cycle characterized by a Na+:ascorbic acid stoichiometry of 2:1 and a substrate binding order of the type Na+:ascorbic acid:Na+. However, SVCT2 is not electrogenic. SVCT2 showed an absolute requirement for Ca2+/Mg2+ for function, with both cations switching the transporter from an inactive into an active conformation by increasing the transport Vmax without affecting the transport Km or the Na+ cooperativity. Our data indicate that SVCT2 may switch between a number of states with characteristic properties, including an inactive conformation in the absence of Ca2+/Mg2+. At least three active states can be envisioned, including a low affinity conformation at Na+ concentrations below 20 mm and two high affinity conformations at elevated Na+ concentrations whose Na+ cooperativity is modulated by ascorbic acid.

Vitamin C exists in two chemically distinct forms: the reduced ionizable form (ascorbic acid) and the oxidized nonionic form (dehydroascorbic acid) (1Rose R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 335-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Human cells acquire vitamin C using two different transporter systems that differ in structural as well as functional terms. One transporter system is a bidirectional, low affinity, high capacity system that includes several members of the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) 4The abbreviations used are: GLUT, facilitative glucose transporter; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein. family, shows absolute specificity for oxidized vitamin C, and transports dehydroascorbic acid down a substrate concentration gradient.

The evidence regarding GLUT2 is still controversial, and there are no data regarding the capacity of GLUT8, GLUT10, and GLUT12-GLUT14 to transport dehydroascorbic acid. GLUT5 is a fructose transporter unable to transport dehydroascorbic acid, which is probably also the situation with GLUT7, GLUT9, and GLUT11, although these last transporters have been less studied from a functional perspective. A second vitamin C transport system is a high affinity, low capacity system, the sodium-ascorbic acid co-transporters (SVCTs), composed of two members that show absolute specificity for ascorbic acid and transport the substrate down the electrochemical sodium gradient (10Liang W.J.

Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). SVCT1 and SVCT2 have been expressed in heterologous systems, but only SVCT1 has been functionally characterized in detail. SVCT1 has an apparent transport Km in the range of 50-200 μm, is electrogenic, and shows a Hill coefficient (nH) for Na+ near 2 (11Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). SVCT2 has been difficult to express in heterologous systems at high efficiency, and the data from these studies do not show a high degree of reproducibility (11Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B.

As a result of these limitations, there is no clear information regarding the values of basic functional parameters such as the transport Km (from 6 to 200 μm), the nH (from 1 to 2), the Na+:ascorbic acid stoichiometry, the substrate binding order, or the mechanism by which bivalent cations affect transport. We present here a detailed characterization of the ascorbic acid transporter SVCT2 of human melanoma cells and propose a basic model for the transport cycle. Our data from conventional and quantitative PCR immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting, cloning and expression in HEK-293 cells, and transport and electrochemical studies indicate that SVCT2 is a high affinity transporter of Na+ and ascorbic acid that shows positive cooperativity for Na+ and has an absolute requirement for Ca2+/Mg2+ for activity. The transport cycle is characterized by a 2:1 Na+:ascorbic acid transport stoichiometry and a substrate binding order of the type Na+:ascorbic acid:Na+. Cell Culture—Human melanoma cells (SK-MEL-131) were grown in RPMI 1640-25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml) (15Spielholz C. Golde D.W. Houghton A.N. Nualart F. Vera J.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2529-2537PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR—mRNA was prepared using the Micro poly(A) Pure kit (Ambion Inc.), and reverse transcription was performed using the rapid RT-PCR kit (Clontech Inc.) (9Maulen N.P. Henriquez E.A. Kempe S. Carcamo J.G. Schmid-Kotsas A. Bachem M. Grunert A. Bustamante M.E. Nualart F. Vera J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9035-9041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 ng of cDNA synthesis product was used as template in a reaction mix containing 40 pmol of the primer pair (13Daruwala R. Song J. Koh W.S. Rumsey S.C. Levine M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), with the program: 2 min at 94 °C; 35 cycles of 2 min each at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Immunolocalization—The cells were fixed in 4% p-formaldehyde, washed, and blocked in phosphate-buffered (pH 7.6) saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, incubated for 18 h at room temperature in the same buffer containing anti-SVCT or goat preimmune serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), washed, and incubated with anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (DAKO, 1:100), and the reaction revealed with H2O2 and 3,3-diaminobenzidine (16Nualart F.

Uptake Assays—The uptake experiments were carried out as previously described using 3-day-old cell monolayers in 12-well tissue culture plates (8Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velasquez F.V. Zhang R.H.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2529-2537PubMed Google Scholar). The transport medium contained 15 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.6), 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. For experiments in Na+-free buffer, NaCl was replaced with choline chloride. Monolayers were washed with transport medium, and uptake experiments were initiated by replacing the medium with prewarmed transport medium containing 0.1 μCi of l-[14C]ascorbic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cold ascorbate at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Uptake was terminated by adding ice-cold stopping solution (15 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm HgCl2). The monolayers were washed and lysed in 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2% SDS, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation spectrometry. The data are presented as the average standard deviation and correspond to a minimum of three assays performed independently in triplicate. Kinetic parameters were determined using the Michaelis-Menten equation and by using the linear transformation of Eadie-Hofstee. Stoichiometry Determination—We performed parallel time course uptake assays of 22Na and radiolabeled ascorbic acid for determination of the sodium/ascorbic acid uptake ratio. The transport medium contained a mixture of sodium transport inhibitors (1 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm amiloride, and 0.1 mm bumetanide) and 0.25 μCi of 22sodium (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or radiolabeled ascorbic acid. Cloning of SVCT2 and Expression in HEK-293 Cells—The full-length SVCT1 and SVCT2 cDNA were obtained by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primer pairs that flank the start and stop codons of SVCT1 and SVCT2, respectively (12Rajan D.P. Huang W. Dutta B. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was done using 0.4 μl of cDNA template, 0.5 μm of each primer, and the following set of reactions: 2 min at 94 °C; 36 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, extracted and purified from agarose gels with the QIAX kit (Qiagen), cloned in the pEGFP vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and analyzed by BLAST at the NCBI server at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. SVCT1-GFP and SVCT2-GFP were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques, cloned in the pEGFP vector, and sequenced. Transfection experiments in HEK-293 cells were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Patch Clamp—Patch clamp in the whole cell configuration was performed 18-24 h post-transfection using an Axopatch-1 (Axon Instrument) apparatus. Culture medium was replaced with an external solution containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose, and the cells were stabilized at room temperature for 30 min. Transfected cells were selected under fluorescence microscopy and the whole cell configuration was established with a holding potential of -60 mV. The currents were filtered at 2 kHz and digitalized (Digidata 1200, Axotape and Pcclamp 9.0; Axon Instruments) for further nonlinear analysis. Statistics—The transport data were processed for nonlinear analysis with the program IgorPro (WaveMetrics). Patch clamp data were analyzed with the program Origin (Microcal Inc.). Melanoma Cells Express a Single Ascorbic Acid Transporter That Corresponds to SVCT2—RT-PCR experiments using cDNAs prepared from RNA obtained from melanoma cells and primers specific for SVCT1 or SVCT2 generated amplification products of the size expected for SVCT2 (370 bp) but not for SVCT1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). The specificity of the amplification reaction was verified by using human liver RNA that was positive for SVCT1 and negative for SVCT2 and total human brain RNA that was positive for SVCT2 and negative for SVCT1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4, and data not shown). These results are in agreement with studies of the presence of SVCT1 and SVCT2-specific transcripts in mammalian tissues and cells (9Maulen N.P. Henriquez E.A. Kempe S. Carcamo J.G. Schmid-Kotsas A.

Expression of SVCT2 at the protein level was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B) and immunocytochemistry with antibodies anti-SVCT1 or -SVCT2 (Fig. 1, B-D). The immunoblotting experiments using anti-SVCT2 and total membranes prepared from SK-MEL cells showed one reactive band with an estimated molecular mass of 50,000 daltons (Fig. 1B, lane 2), which is consistent with the size of SVCT2 predicted from the coding region of the cDNA, but there was no immunoreactive band with anti-SVCT1 (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Control experiments revealed an immunoreactive band in membranes prepared from renal Madin-Darby canine kidney cells that express SVCT1 (data not shown). The immunolocalization experiments confirmed expression of SVCT2 in the melanoma cells, but were negative for SVCT1 (Fig. 1, C-E). Proper reactivity of the antibodies was confirmed by using cells and tissues known to express the different transporters. Human renal epithelial cells were positive for SVCT1 and SVCT2, hepatocytes were positive for SVCT1 and negative for SVCT2, and adrenal cells were positive for SVCT2 and negative for SVCT1 (data not shown), which is consistent with previous data on the differential expression of SVCT1 and SVCT2 in different tissues and cells (11Tsukaguchi H.

Transport studies confirmed that the melanoma cells expressed an ascorbic acid transporter with functional properties similar to those of SVCT2 (Fig. 2, A-E). Time course analysis of ascorbic acid uptake revealed that the melanoma cells take up ascorbic acid at a constant rate of 130 pmol/min/million cells for at least 10 min (data not shown). Dose-response experiments showed that transport approached saturation at 100 μm ascorbic acid (Fig. 2A), and analysis of the transport data with the Eadie-Hofstee method generated a straight line that is indicative of the presence of a single functional component, for which we calculated an apparent Km of 17 ± 2 μm (n = 8) and a Vmax of 150 ± 4 pmol/min/million cells (Fig. 2B). Expression studies of cloned SVCT1 and SVCT2 have rendered results indicating that they may show different Km values depending on the expression system used and also on the cell, tissue, or species from where the transporters were cloned. Rat SVCT1 and SVCT2 expressed in X. laevis oocytes showed transport Km values of 19-30 μm (SVCT1) and 9.4 μm (SVCT2), whereas for the human isoforms the Km values were 75-250 μm (SVCT1) and 22-69 μm (SVCT2) (11Tsukaguchi H.

Thus, two different transport Km values have been determined for the same transporter (cloned from the same tissue and expressed in the same system) by two different laboratories (13Daruwala R. Song J. Koh W.S. Rumsey S.C. Levine M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 14Wang Y. Mackenzie B. Tsukaguchi H. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Hediger M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We have examined the kinetic properties of SVCT2 expressed in 10 different primary cells and cell lines and found that in all cases the transport Km is close to 20 μm (data not shown). In this context, the functional properties of the ascorbic acid transporter expressed in the melanoma cells are fully compatible with its molecular identification as SVCT2. Na+ Cooperativity and the Na+:Ascorbic Acid Stoichiometry—A fundamental property of the ascorbic acid transporters of the SVCT type is their potent activation by sodium ions. Uptake of ascorbic acid by the melanoma cells required the presence of sodium ions, as shown by a greater than 95% decrease in the rate of uptake (from 130 to less than 7 pmol/min/million cells) when the Na+ in the incubation buffer was replaced with choline+, Cs+, K+, or Li+ (Fig. 2E). To further analyze this issue, transport of 100 μm ascorbic acid, a concentration at which SVCT2 is near saturation, was measured in the presence of graded extracellular concentrations (0-135 mm) of Na+. A clear increase in the ascorbic acid transport rate as a function of increasing Na+ concentration was observed (Fig. 2C), with the rate increasing at least 20-fold when the concentration of extracellular Na+ went from 0 to 135 mm, a process that was characterized by a Na50 (the Na+ concentration that increased the transport rate to 50% of the maximal effect) of 35 mm and a sigmoidal relationship between uptake rate and Na+ concentration, suggesting that the effect of Na+ on the transport rate was cooperative (Fig. 2C). Confirming this interpretation, when the data were fitted to the Hill equation, the line obtained showed an nH of 1.9 (Fig. 2D), which is consistent with the presence of at least two sodium sites showing positive cooperativity. An nH of 1.9 can be interpreted as indicating that the binding of Na+ to the first Na+-binding site increases the affinity of the second Na+ site and does not provide information on the Na+: ascorbic acid stoichiometry (20Cornish-Bowden A. Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamental of Enzyme Kinetic. Butterworth & Co., Ltd., London1979: 147-176Google Scholar, 21Smith-Maxwell C. Bennett E. Randles J. Kimmich G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C234-C242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, previous results obtained in expression studies of cloned SVCT2, which indicated a cooperative Na+ effect with an nH near 2, have been erroneously interpreted as indicating a 2:1 Na+:ascorbic acid stoichiometry (12Rajan D.P. Huang W. Dutta B. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Wang H. Dutta B. Huang W. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We directly addressed this issue by measuring the transport of 22Na in the presence and in the absence of 100 μm ascorbic acid and comparing it with the transport of ascorbic acid in the presence and in the absence of 135 mm NaCl (Fig. 2, F-H). Under these conditions, the ascorbic acid-coupled net 22Na transport rate was 0.36 nmol/106 cells/min (Fig. 2F), and the Na+-coupled net ascorbic acid transport rate was 0.20 nmol/106 cells/min (Fig. 2G). Thus, at 100 μm ascorbic acid and 135 mm NaCl, the transport of one molecule of ascorbic acid was coupled to the transport of two Na+ molecules, resulting in a 2:1 sodium:ascorbic acid stoichiometry (Fig. 2H). Na+ Activates Transport by Decreasing the Ascorbic Acid Transport Km—We examined the mechanism by which Na+ increases the rate of ascorbic acid transport. At 5 and 15 mm Na+, the saturation curves were hyperbolic, and the transporter was still not saturated at 5mm ascorbic acid, indicating that SVCT2 was fully capable of transporting ascorbic acid at low Na+ concentrations, but with a transport Km in the millimolar range (Fig. 3, A and B). A detailed analysis of the transport kinetics using graded extracellular Na+ concentrations (from 5 to 35 mm) revealed that Na+ increased the transport rate by decreasing the transport Km for ascorbic acid in a complex, nonlinear, and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Thus, there was an almost linear decrease in the ascorbic acid transport Km, from 2 mm to 120 μm as Na+ increased from 5 to 20 mm, followed by a second, slower phase in which the transport Km decreased from 120 to 17 μm with a change in Na+ from 20 to 135 mm (Fig. 3C). Overall, there was more than a 100-fold decrease in the value of the Km for ascorbic acid when Na+ was increased from 5 to 135 mm. In contrast, there was no appreciable change in the transport Vmax, which remained at ∼150 pmol/106 cells/min when Na+ was increased from 5 to 135 mm (Fig. 3C). Our data showing a biphasic effect of Na+ on the Km of SVCT2 for ascorbic acid could be interpreted as indicating the occurrence of two successive conformational rearrangements in SVCT2, the first occurring at low concentrations of Na+ followed by a second at higher Na+ concentrations. Moreover, the kinetic data indicating that the ascorbic acid transport Km changes as a function of the Na+ concentration supports a substrate binding order of the type Na+-ascorbic acid-Na+. The kinetic analysis does not provide enough data to identify the specific step in the overall transport cycle that is affected by the presence of Na+. Data obtained with the Na+-glucose and the Na+-glutamate co-transporters was interpreted as indicating that the Na+ effect on the transport Km is associated with conformational transitions that expose the substrate binding site (22Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2110-2115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Vayro S. Lo B. Silverman M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, recent data with the Lac permease, a transporter of lactose whose transport activity is driven by the electrochemical H+ gradient, indicated that the H+ effect is not related to changes in the transporter affinity for the substrate (24Guan L. Kaback R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12148-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, our present data cannot be interpreted as indicating the occurrence of Na+-driven changes in the substrate binding site(s) leading to increased affinity for ascorbic acid, as opposed to conformational changes that directly affect the substrate translocation steps (see Fig. 6A). Ascorbic Acid Affects the Na+ Cooperativity and the Na+50—Because SVCT2 is a co-transporter of Na+ and ascorbic acid, and Na+ affects the transport of ascorbic acid, we asked whether ascorbic acid affects the Na+ cooperativity. For this, we selected a wide range of ascorbic acid concentrations, from 5to500 μm, and measured the rate of transport of ascorbic acid at increasing Na+ concentrations. These experiments revealed that the Na+ cooperativity was moderate at low ascorbic acid concentrations (5 μm) and was lost at high (>200 μm) ascorbic acid (Fig. 3D). Thus, although at 5 μm ascorbic acid the ascorbic acid uptake curve was sigmoidal, with an nH of less than 1.4 (Fig. 3, D and E), the corresponding curve at 500 μm ascorbic acid was clearly hyperbolic, with an nH of 1.0 (Fig. 3, D and E). A detailed analysis revealed that the nH for Na+ varied in a complex and bimodal manner as a function of the ascorbic acid concentration; it increased from 1.4 at low ascorbic acid concentrations to a maximum value of 2 at 50-100 μm ascorbic acid and decreased to ∼1.0 at ascorbic acid concentrations >200 μm (Fig. 3F). On the other hand, the Na+50 decreased in a unimodal, nonlinear manner with increasing concentrations of ascorbic acid, from 80 mm at 5 μm ascorbic acid to 35 mm at 50 μm ascorbic acid, and reached a lowest value of 20 mm at 500 μm ascorbic acid (Fig. 3F). These results, indicating that the transport of ascorbic acid is strongly influenced by the simultaneous presence of Na+ and that the interaction of Na+ with the transporter is affected by the presence of ascorbic acid, are fully consistent with the function of SVCT2 as a Na+-ascorbic acid co-transporter. The effect of ascorbic acid on the Na+ cooperativity can be rationalized if we include in the analysis the evidence indicating that the Na+:ascorbic acid stoichiometry is 2:1 and that the substrate binding order is Na+-ascorbic acid-Na+. Thus, the data demonstrating low Na+ cooperativity at low ascorbic acid concentrations can be interpreted as evidence indicating that ascorbic acid does not participate in the binding of the first Na+ but affects the binding of the second Na+, an interpretation that is consistent with a binding order of the type Na+-ascorbic acid-Na+ and the Na+ cooperativity observed at concentrations of ascorbic acid near or above the transport Km. It is, however, difficult to explain the lack of cooperativity observed at ascorbic acid concentrations greater than 200 μm and the fact that these high concentrations of ascorbic acid still affect the Na+50 (which approaches 20 mm at 500 μm ascorbic acid) without evidence of further ascorbic acid transport (at these concentrations, SVCT2 approaches saturation caused by a transport Km of less than 20 μm). One possibility is that, at high concentrations, ascorbic acid may affect the functional properties of the first Na+-binding site, increasin"

The antitumor activity of orlistat can be attributed to its ability to inhibit the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS). The objective of the present study was to test the effect of orlistat on endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Orlistat inhibits endothelial cell FAS, blocks the synthesis of fatty acids, and prevents endothelial cell proliferation. More significantly, orlistat inhibits human neovascularization in an ex vivo assay, which suggests that it may be useful as an antiangiogenic drug. The mechanism of these effects can be traced to the fact that orlistat prevents the display of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR2/KDR/Flk1) on the endothelial cell surface. Thus, orlistat is an antiangiogenic agent with a novel mechanism of action."

Involvement of specific kinases in such resistance is likely. We developed a systematic strategy to screen the human kinome and select kinases whose inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells can increase 1) spontaneous apoptosis or 2) gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. The pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line MiaPaCa-2 was transfected with 645 pairs of siRNAs directed to all human kinases. The same experiment was conducted in cells treated with 150 microM gemcitabine. Apoptosis was measured after 2 days and the results were normalized for cell viability. A panel of 56 kinases whose inhibition increased spontaneous apoptosis by at least 50% was established. Ten of them gave similar results on Panc1 and BxPC3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. A panel of 83 kinases whose inhibition increased gemcitabine-induced apoptosis by 50% or more was also established. Twelve kinases appeared in both panels. A cumulative increase in apoptosis was observed when inhibiting simultaneously several kinases. Such a systematic approach allowed characterization of all kinases involved in pancreatic cancer cell survival and resistance to gemcitabine. Inhibitors of these kinases, used alone or in combination, might improve the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2013803693,"The cytochrome bc complexes found in mitochondria, chloroplasts and many bacteria play critical roles in their respective electron transport chains. The quinol oxidase (Qo) site in this complex oxidizes a hydroquinone (quinol), reducing two one-electron carriers, a low potential cytochrome b heme and the “Rieske” iron-sulfur cluster. The overall electron transfer reactions are coupled to transmembrane translocation of protons via a “Q-cycle” mechanism, which generates proton motive force for ATP synthesis. Since semiquinone intermediates of quinol oxidation are generally highly reactive, one of the key questions in this field is: how does the Qo site oxidize quinol without the production of deleterious side reactions including superoxide production? We attempt to test three possible general models to account for this behavior: 1) The Qo site semiquinone (or quinol-imidazolate complex) is unstable and thus occurs at a very low steady-state concentration, limiting O2 reduction; 2) the Qo site semiquinone is highly stabilized making it unreactive toward oxygen; and 3) the Qo site catalyzes a quantum mechanically coupled two-electron/two-proton transfer without a semiquinone intermediate. Enthalpies of activation were found to be almost identical between the uninhibited Q-cycle and superoxide production in the presence of antimycin A in wild type. This behavior was also preserved in a series of mutants with altered driving forces for quinol oxidation.

Three enzymatic binding sites participate in catalysis on the cyt bc1 complex, the quinol oxidase (Qo) site, quinol reductase (Qi) site, and a docking site for soluble cyt c on cyt c1. The Qo site is located toward the positively charged side of the membrane, where protons are released during turnover of the enzyme. The Qi site is located toward the negatively charged surface of the membrane, where protons are taken up during catalysis. The water-soluble cyt c docking site is located on the c-type cyt representing the terminal electron carrier within the cyt bc1 complex on the positive side of the membrane. Cyt bc1 complex catalysis is thought to occur by a “Q-cycle” mechanism (1Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 689-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 12Mitchell P.

Perhaps the key reaction of the Q-cycle is the “bifurcated” electron transfer at the Qo site, the mechanism of which is still controversial (1Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev.

In the bifurcated reaction, QH2 is oxidized at the Qo site, with one electron being transferred through the high potential chain to reduce cyt c, and the other electron is transferred through the low potential chain, to reduce a quinoid species (Q or SQ, depending on the state of the two-electron gate) at the Qi site. Two turnovers of the Qo site are required to reduce a Qi site Q to a QH2. Under some conditions, the Q-cycle can be short circuited by various “bypass” reactions, some of which yield the physiologically deleterious superoxide (18Kramer D.M. Roberts A.G. Muller F. Cape J.

The bypass reactions are typically observed in vitro under “partially inhibited” conditions, e.g. in the presence of antimycin A (AA) or under high proton motive force, where it is thought that the [2Fe2S] cluster can oxidize QH2 to a semiquinone (SQ), but processing of electrons by the low potential chain is hindered, resulting in the accumulation of a SQ intermediate, which in turn can reduce O2 to superoxide (18Kramer D.M.

In the third category (Scheme 1, panel C), the SQ is avoided completely by forcing both quinol electrons to be transferred simultaneously (28Osyczka A. Moser C.C. Daldal F. Dutton P.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13535-13541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition to the above models, a number of “gating” mechanisms have been proposed where the Qo site is modified during key stages of catalysis, preventing the escape of reactive intermediates (30Darrouzet E.

In this work, we attempt to discriminate among these models by comparing the activation energetics for the uninhibited Q-cycle and superoxide production in the presence of AA in Saccharomyces cerivisae complexes with a range of [2Fe2S] cluster redox potentials (33Denke E.

Ammonium sulfate (Fisher) and yeast nitrogen base (Sigma) without amino acids were added as a source of nitrogen. Submitochondrial Particles Preparation—Submitochondrial particles (SMPs) were prepared as described Muller et al. (20Muller F.L. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and used as prepared or after dispersal in dodecyl maltoside (5 mg/mg protein/dodecyl maltoside) (Anatrace) on ice for 1 h, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 × g to remove insoluble material. The concentration of cyt bc1 complex was estimated by measuring the sodium dithionite/ascorbate absorbance difference spectrum of the cyt b hemes at 562-578 nm using an extinction coefficient of 25.6 mm·cm-1 (35Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—All assays were carried out in buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaN3, 50 μm horse heart cyt c+3 (Fisher), 50 μm decylubiquinol at pH = 8.0. Sample temperature was set using a flowing temperature controller and water jacketed cell holder and measured in situ using a thermocouple thermometer. Rates are reported as mol of cyt c+3 reduced·s-1·mol-1 cyt bc1 complex. In all experiments, the kinetic traces were initiated before the addition of enzyme (0.5-20 nm cyt b) to allow for the subtraction of background cyt c reduction (or background superoxide production) by free decylubiquinol. Decylubiquinol was freshly generated as needed using a modification of the technique reported in Kramer et al. (36Kramer D.M. Joliot A. Joliot P. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 251-262Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) by reducing decylubiquinone (Sigma) dissolved in 1:1 ethanol:ethylene glycol with ∼2 mg of sodium borohydride, followed by the addition of 0.1 N HCl to quench unreacted sodium borohydride. For the superoxide production experiments, the cyt bc1 complex was treated with a saturating (20 μm) concentration of AA (Sigma). For measuring superoxide production in the presence of 20 μm AA, we used the Amplex Red assay (product number 12212; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). This assay was found to be much more sensitive than the cyt c reduction experiments described in (18Kramer D.M. Roberts A.G. Muller F. Cape J. Bowman M.K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 21-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Muller F.L. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Resorufin fluorescence was measured using an in-house constructed fluorimeter. Fluorescence was excited at 525 nm using 2.3 KHz modulated green light emitting diodes and detected at 90° from the direction of excitation via a photodiode (Hamamatsu 1223) covered by a 590 ± 30 nm band pass filter. Signals were amplified using a laboratory built amplifier and processed with a Thor Labs Inc. model LIA 100 lock-in amplifier. The assay was calibrated by titrating known amounts of hydrogen peroxide into the assay buffer with the full complement of enzymes and buffers. The calibration parameters were independent of temperature within the experimental range. All superoxide production rates are quoted as mol of superoxide generated·s-1·mol-1 cyt bc1 complex. This system yielded results that allowed us to detect as little as 100 pm superoxide produced·s-1 in our 500-μl volume. The wild-type SMPs were tested using the cyt c reduction method (18Kramer D.M. Roberts A.G. Muller F. Cape J. Bowman M.K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 21-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Muller F.L. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and found to yield rates within 5% of that determined by the Amplex Red system. Pre-steady-state Kinetics—Pre-steady-state reduction of the cyt bc1 complex was followed by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using an OLIS Rapid Scanning Monochromator. The temperature of the mixing chamber was varied from 10-35 °C with a thermostatically controlled Julabo F12 circulating water bath, and the temperature of the enzyme sample was equilibrated to that of the mixing chamber before each reaction. Reactions were started by mixing 3 μm cyt bc1 complex in assay buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, plus 1 mm sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20 against an equal volume of the same buffer containing decylubiquinol. A fresh solution of decylubiquinol substrate was prepared before each experiment, and the concentration was varied from 20 to 180 μm as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. Two equivalents of AA per cyt bc1 were mixed with the enzyme prior to the reaction to block any reduction of cyt b through the Qi site. A spectrum of oxidized bc1 complex was obtained by mixing the oxidized bc1 complex against assay buffer and averaging the data sets to a single scan. For each experiment, seven or eight data sets were averaged, and the oxidized spectrum was subtracted from each scan. From the three-dimensional data set comprised of wavelength, absorbance, and time, the time course and amplitude change for cyt b reduction at 563 nm minus 578 nm or cyt c1 reduction at 553 nm minus 539 nm was extracted using the OLIS software. General Enzymatic Data—The apparent Michaelis constant (Km) for decylubiquinol at the cyt bc1 complex Qo site in detergent-solubilized SMPs was 4-12 μm for wild type and each of the mutants (see Table 1), consistent with previous determinations (19Muller F.

In the presence of saturating concentrations of myxothiazol, we found a raised Km of ∼40 μm decylubiquinol, consistent with previous observations (19Muller F. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), implying that the measured Km values reflect saturation of the Qo site with substrate (and not other processes such as micelle breaking). We concluded that 50 μm decylubiquinol essentially saturated the Qo site under steady-state uninhibited conditions.TABLE 1Enzyme parametersMutantEm,7aData from Ref. 25VQCVSOPKmEaNo inhibitorsAntimycin A bypassmVμmkJ·mol–1Wild type+2851852.74.5 ± 0.557.0 ± 3.159.5 ± 5.1S183T+2691242.512.4 ± 1.160.4 ± 2.062.8 ± 4.1Y185F+217590.99.2 ± 3.662.3 ± 0.866.6 ± 3.0S183A+165230.154.3 ± 1.268.6 ± 1.373.4 ± 5.3a Data from Ref. 25Crofts A.R.

Activation Energy Measurements—The Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) for the uninhibited turnover of the wild type yeast enzyme was found to be 57.0 ± 3.0 kJ·mol-1 at pH 8.0 (see Fig. 1), consistent with previous reports from the cyt bc1 complex in Rhodobacter, Bos, and Saccharomyces (17Hong S.

We also measured the rates of pre-steady-state reduction of cyt b and cyt c1 at a range of temperatures and decylubiquinol concentrations in cyt bc1 complex isolated from wild-type yeast as shown in Fig. 2. These measurements have the advantage that they are not complicated by considerations of ionic strength or detergent concentration (which did alter the apparent Km for ubiquinol in the Qo site) as in the catalytic assay. As shown in Fig. 3, when these measurements were used to calculate activation energies, they gave values of 53 kJ mol-1 for cyt b reduction and 50 kJ mol-1 for c1 reduction. When corrected for pH, these values are in good agreement with the activation energy for the catalytic turnover of the enzyme. The fact that cyt b and cyt c1 reduction have the same activation energy is noteworthy since these rates likely reflect the first and second oxidation steps of the ubiquinol at the Qo site. This has implications as regards the rate-limiting step in ubiquinol oxidation as discussed below. The Ea increased linearly with decreasing driving force for QH2 oxidation, i.e. with decreasing Em (equilibrium redox midpoint potential (versus standard hydrogen electrode)) for the [2Fe2S] cluster (Fig. 4). The slope of Ea versus Em was similar for the uninhibited Q-cycle and superoxide production in the presence of AA (see Fig. 4), and, importantly, the value of this slope was near one. Over the entire range of complexes, the Ea measured for higher than that for the uninhibited Q-cycle. This difference was significant to the 95% confidence limit. When experiments were repeated in absence of added detergents, Arrhenius plots deviated from linearity at higher temperatures (data not shown), likely reflecting a shift in rate-limiting step from QH2 oxidation at the Qo site at low temperature to other processes, as suggested for similar trends seen in chromatophores from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (17Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33931-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the Ea values at lower temperatures were similar to those shown in Fig. 1, suggesting QH2 oxidation was not strongly modified by addition of detergent. We found that the activation energies for the uninhibited Q-cycle and superoxide production in the presence of AA were nearly identical within the noise (Fig. 4). Changing the driving force for QH2 oxidation by changing the redox properties of the [2Fe2S] cluster resulted in linear changes in Ea for both the Q-cycle and superoxide production, with a slope near unity (Fig. 4). The similarities in Ea and its dependence on the Em of the [2Fe2S] cluster indicates that both the normal Q-cycle and superoxide production are rate-limited by a process which involves electron transfer from QH2 to the [2Fe2S] cluster, most likely involving very similar chemistry (see Fig. 5). The fact that the activation energies for reduction of cyt b and cyt c1 under pre-steady-state conditions are identical allows us to exclude the possibility that movement of the Rieske protein prerequisite to reduction of cyt c1 is the rate-limiting step at the Qo site, and it is consistent with our conclusion that electron transfer to the 2Fe2S cluster is rate-limiting. In these experiments, conducted at pH 7.0, oxidation of the first QH2 at the Qo site reduces cyt b and the [2Fe2S] cluster, with only partial cyt c1 reduction, owing to its relatively low midpoint potential in comparison to that of the [2Fe2S] cluster. During the second QH2 oxidation, cyt c1 becomes reduced. The observed rate of cyt c1 reduction is slower than cyt b reduction due to the fast equilibration with the [2Fe2S] cluster, which favors the electron residing in the [2Fe2S] cluster. The fact that cyt b and cyt c1 reduction have the same activation energy, reflecting sequential turnovers of the Qo site, indicates that they share the same rate-limiting step, QH2 oxidation, as suggested previously by Hong et al. (17Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33931-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) probing flash-induced kinetics in the R. sphaeroides chromatophore system. Besides the hypothetical Qo site SQ, the most reducing species is cyt bL+2 with an Em between -30 and -50 mV, probably insufficiently reducing to support rapid rates of O2 reduction (20Muller F.L. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), as also suggested by slow rates of cyt b oxidation in the presence of O2 (45Forquer I. Cape J. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Photosynthesis: Fundamental Aspects to Global Perspectives. ACG Publishing, Montreal2004Google Scholar). Furthermore, superoxide production is readily observed in the presence of Qo site “proximal niche” inhibitors (e.g. myxothiazol, methoxyacrylate-stilbene, mucidin) that completely inhibit cyt b reduction (19Muller F. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Muller F.L. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M.

Acta. 2002; 1555: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These inhibitors probably allow QH2 to bind to the “distal” niche of the Qo pocket, allowing electron transfer to the [2Fe2S] cluster, forming SQ, which in turn reduces O2 (18Kramer D.M. Roberts A.G. Muller F. Cape J. Bowman M.K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 21-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Muller F.L. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Cape J.L. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 46-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that a Qo site intermediate, likely a SQ, is the reductant for superoxide production. Our data thus imply that production of the low potential reductant that reduces cyt bL in the Q-cycle is also involved in superoxide production and is formed via the same (or very similar) routes (i.e. these two processes probably share the same reactive intermediates, see Scheme 1, panel A). The low potential reductant may be SQ, as discussed above. An alternative suggested by Trumpower (48Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is that the cyt bL reductant is a quinol:imidazolate complex formed when an electron from the quinol oxygen is delocalized into the orbitals of the imidazole ring and [2Fe2S] cluster, although the energetics for delocalization would still follow the relative redox potential of the [2Fe2S] cluster, and thus such a species would be energetically indistinguishable from a discrete SQ. In either case, we conclude that the formation of the low potential reductant occurs during both the normal Q-cycle and during superoxide production and that the reductant is formed through the same transition barrier (see Scheme 1, panel A). This conclusion is in contradiction with Qo site models involving truly simultaneous electron transfer from QH2 to directly form Q, because they require radically different Qo site chemistries for Q-cycle superoxide production (18Kramer D.M. Roberts A.G. Muller F. Cape J. Bowman M.K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 21-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Muller F.L. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M.

Nature. 2004; 427: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Theoretical treatments by Zusman and Beratan (49Zusman L.D. Beratan D.N. Journal of Chemical Physics. 1996; 105: 165-176Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) predict distinct transition barriers and reorganization energies for sequential versus concerted (DCET) electron transfers reactions, which should be reflected in different Ea values and reorganization energies, i.e. their dependencies on driving force (compare the solid lines, representing the DCET reaction with the dashed lines representing the sequential reaction in Scheme 1, panel C). In contrast, our data show that normal Q-cycle turnover and superoxide production have very similar activation barriers and their response to the redox properties of the [2Fe2S] cluster, which clearly alters the driving force for the reactions. Overall, the simplest interpretation of our data is that DCET does not operate within the Qo site. Alternatively, one could argue that AA-inhibited enzyme acts in a completely different way, with fortuitously similar energetics, but this seems very improbable. We also cannot at present rule out another possibility that the reductant for superoxide production occurs after the Qo site-activated intermediate, e.g. a special form of cyt bL with a very low redox potential able to reduce O2, thus giving similar activation behavior for both processes. In this case, though, we would have to invoke a separate mechanism for superoxide production in the presence of myxothiazol or other Qo site proximal niche inhibitors (20Muller F.L. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Cape J.L. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 46-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Osyczka A. Moser C.C. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), making this option more complex. Class 2 models invoke high stabilization of the Qo site SQ, preventing it from being an effective O2 reductant (Scheme 1, panel B). We argue that our data places certain limits on the stability of the Qo site SQ. If, for instance, the Qo site SQ is highly stabilized its formation would be energetically favored (Gibbs free energy (ΔG) < 0), while its oxidation would require the input of energy (26Berry E.A. Huang L.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this case, we would expect the rate-limiting and energy-requiring step to be shifted from QH2 oxidation by the [2Fe2S] cluster to SQ oxidation by cyt bL and consequently little dependence on the redox properties of the [2Fe2S] cluster. Instead, we observed linear dependence of Ea on changing the Em of the [2Fe2S] cluster, consistent with previous work (33Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34Snyder C.H. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7436-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) indicating that the rate-limiting step for the Qo site reaction involves electron transfer to the [2Fe2S] cluster. This conclusion is consistent with work by Crofts and co-workers (1Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 689-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) suggesting that the fractional occupancy of the intermediate states of Qo site catalyzed QH2 oxidation could not exceed 0.1. We add, though, that this conclusion does not exclude stabilization of a SQ species after it is formed as long as the processes involved are significantly more rapid that the initial formation of SQ from QH2. We next consider a simple “unstable” SQ model (Scheme 1, panel A), where QH2 bound at the Qo site comes into equilibrium with a Qo site SQ. If the SQ is highly unstable, its formation at the Qo site would be energetically unfavorable (ΔG > 0), and its concentration should be roughly proportional to the logarithm of driving force for the one-electron transfer to the 2Fe2S cluster, as indeed we observed (Fig. 4). Furthermore, if superoxide production at the Qo site is pseudo-first order (with respect to [SQ]), then the rate of superoxide production also should depend linearly on the logarithm of changes in driving force for SQ formation. Again, as shown in Fig. 5, this is precisely what we have observed, leading us to suggest that an unstable Qo site SQ comes into equilibrium with the ground state of the enzyme and that this SQ can be oxidized either by cyt b, resulting in normal Q-cycle activity, or by other oxidants including O2, resulting in superoxide production or other bypass reactions. In principle, the SQ could appear either near the transition state for QH2 oxidation, as suggested by Hong and co-workers (17Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33931-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), or as a species that has a concentration that is tightly coupled to the concentration of the transition state. Because the Ea values for superoxide production and Q-cycle turnover are quite similar, the reactive intermediate of the Q-cycle could reduce either cyt b or O2 without a large difference in enthalpic terms. This likely places the midpoint potential of the O2/cyt bL reductant similar to or more negetic than that of the O2/O2˙- couple. If the solution potential for this couple operates in our system, this would imply a potential of around -150 mV or lower for the cyt bL (or O2) reductant, again suggesting a very unstable intermediate. Although this simple model accounts for the data in this paper, an important caveat needs to be considered. It has been pointed out by several authors (20Muller F.L. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Cape J.L. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M.

Nature. 2004; 427: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) that superoxide production by the cyt bc1 complex occurs at measurable rates only when the complex is partially inhibited, e.g. by AA or high proton motive force. (It should be noted, however, there are reports of significant superoxide production by uninhibited cyt bc1 complexes (22Sun J. Trumpower B.L. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 51Gong X. Yu L. Xia D. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

Our own experiments on the Saccharomyces cyt bc1 complex did not show rates of superoxide production above the background (20Muller F.L. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and there appears to be general consensus that superoxide production is slow in the uninhibited complex. In conflict with these observations, the simple, unstable SQ model described above predicts similar transition states under conditions favoring uninhibited Q-cycle and SO production. In one possible model to reconcile these observations, the Qo site could act primarily as a sealed “reaction chamber” (24Cape J.L. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 46-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Under uninhibited conditions, where the lifetime of the SQ intermediate is short, the chamber can effectively shield the SQ from oxygen. However, when the Q-cycle is blocked, SQ can escape from the reaction chamber or oxygen can diffuse into the chamber, perhaps following slow (on the time scale of the overall reaction), large scale conformational fluctuations of the complex. Several groups have suggested reasonable models that entail conformational or electrostatic gating of the Qo site reactions (52Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F.

Acta. 2006; 1757: 1019-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In these models, the activity of the Qo site is gated by the properties of other components of the complex. For example, the Qo site might not be able to bind substrate or becomes redox-inactive when cyt bL is reduced (28Osyczka A. Moser C.C. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), the Qi site is altered (54Cooley J.W. Ohnishi T. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10520-10532Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), substrate occupancy in one-half of the operational dimer (50Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17005-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may inhibit activity in the other half of the dimer (53Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, such gating could effectively prevent side reactions but might be susceptible to slippage over large time scales, leading to the observed differences in SO production rates in the uninhibited and inhibited cases. In both the “leaky reaction chamber” and the “leaky gating” models, superoxide production is at least partly controlled by conformational changes. We thank Drs. Jonathan Cape, James Hurst, Mike Kahn, and Atsuko Kanazawa for stimulating discussion."

Together, these results suggest that SNX10 activity may be involved in the regulation of endosome homeostasis. Eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells by the presence of membrane-enveloped organelles with distinct morphological features such as the nuclei, the Golgi complex, the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or chloroplasts in plants and those with less morphological characteristics such as secretory vesicles, endosomes, and lysosomes (1Dacks J.B. Doolittle W.F. Cell. 2001; 107: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These organelles help the cell establish an ordered structure within which its complex biochemical reactions and signaling processes are executed. Although highly compartmentalized, these organelles are interconnected through a network of vesicles shuttling between them to distribute important cargos among different compartments and deliver wastes for disposal in the cytosols or the lysosomes (2Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 5Munro S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, each cell achieves a state of homeostasis within this intracellular organelle system such that the relevant cellular functions are carried out properly, and its disruption may lead to cellular malfunctions.The organelles that constitute the secretory pathway are perhaps the most dynamic and best understood through both genetic and biochemical approaches (4Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). The secretory pathway achieves a state of homeostasis via rapid transfer of cargos through the organelles by the budding and fusion of vesicular intermediates from donor to acceptor compartments (4Bonifacino J.S.

Distinct subcellular localization of individual PI species on different organelles is generated by a combination of organelle-specific PI kinases and phosphatases through cyclically phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the PIs (6De Matteis M.A. Godi A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The resulting PIs in turn recruit transport machinery and PI-binding proteins to a specific organelle (6De Matteis M.A. Godi A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As such, a “PI-map” has been proposed to explain the compartmentalization of intracellular membrane systems (6De Matteis M.A. Godi A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 7De Matteis M.A. Godi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The PIs are recognized by PIBMs or PI-binding modules including the FYVE (Fab1, YOTB/ZK632.12, Vac1, and EEA1), PX (PHOX homology), PH (pleckstrin homology), ENTH (epsin N-terminal homology) and ANTH (AP180 N-terminal homology) domains (6De Matteis M.A. Godi A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 8Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol.

Each of the PIBMs can recognize one or several of the seven known PI species (PtdIns 3-phosphate or PI3P; PtdIns 4-phosphate or PI4P; PtdIns 5-phosphate or PI5P; PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate or PI3,4P2; PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate or PI4,5P2; PtdIns 3,5-bisphosphate or PI3,5P2; and PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate or PI3,4,5P3), or each PI could be recognized by multiple PIBMs in mammalian cells, thus, generating a combinatorial binding specificities among intracellular vesicles and organelles (10De Matteis M.A. Di Campli A. Godi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For example, the PH domain can recognize PI4P; PI3,4P2; PI4,5P2; PI3,5P2; and PI3,4,5P3, while PI3P can be recognized by both PX and FYVE domains (10De Matteis M.A. Di Campli A. Godi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, each PI species maps to specific subcellular organelles: the PI3P to the early endosomes, phagosomes, and multivescular bodies (MVBs), the PI4P to secretory vesicles, PI4,5P2 to coated pits at the plasma membrane and Golgi complex, and PI3,5P2 to MVBs/late endosomes, and PI3,4,5P3 in plasma membrane during phagocytosis (10De Matteis M.A. Di Campli A. Godi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This PI map suggests that the PI species play a critical role in generating and maintaining the compartmentalization of organelles through interactions with their binding partners.The sorting nexins (SNXs) are a large diverse group of proteins unified by the presence of a PX domain (11Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The first SNX, SNX1, was discovered by yeast two-hybrid screen as a regulator of EGFR trafficking and shares homology with a yeast protein called Mvp1 or multicopy suppressor of vacuolar sorting protein 1 (Vps1) (12Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed additional yeast proteins such as Vps5 and Vps17 that contain a PX domain and function in vacuole sorting (13Horazdovsky B.F. Davies B.A. Seaman M.N. McLaughlin S.A. Yoon S. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1529-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), thus, suggesting that SNXs function to regulate membrane trafficking. Recent evidence demonstrated that SNX1 functions in an analogous fashion to its yeast orthologue, Vps5p, as a retromer for cargo retrieval from the degradative pathway (14Carlton J. Bujny M. Peter B.J. Oorschot V.M. Rutherford A. Mellor H. Klumperman J. McMahon H.T. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Currently, there are 29 known or predicted members in the SNX family, with most of them remain uncharacterized (15Carlton J. Bujny M. Rutherford A. Cullen P. Traffic. 2005; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). While the small group of SNXs that have been characterized so far appear to function in cargo-sorting in the endosomes, the function of most SNXs remains unknown (15Carlton J. Bujny M. Rutherford A. Cullen P. Traffic. 2005; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).We have been looking for strategies to identify regulators of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases or MT-MMPs trafficking (16Wang P. Wang X. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20461-20470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Recently, we have undertaken a candidate gene family approach and screened all known members of the sorting nexin family as potential MT-MMP regulators (the results will be detailed elsewhere). We report here a surprising finding that SNX10 is capable of generating giant vacuoles in mammalian cells. Our results suggest that SNX10 is part of the regulatory machinery that governs endosome homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructions and Reagents—Expressed sequence tag cDNA clones of human SNXs were either purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) or cloned by reverse transcription-PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing with ABI3730 sequencer. Sequences were compared with those deposited at NCBI or GenBank™. The full-length coding fragments were cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pCR3.1-uni-tagged with FLAG or GFP-FLAG. The sequences were re-confirmed by DNA sequencing with ABI3730 sequencer. Point mutations of SNX10 were generated with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA) according to the manufacturer's manual. Domain-swap mutants of SNX3 and SNX10 were generated by PCR and inserted into pCR3.1-uni-GFP-FLAG. Endosome marker protein expressing vectors FYVEDsRed and Px-GFP were gifts from Dr. Jun Yuan (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Rabbit anti-EGFR antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology. EGF was purchased from R&D and added to cell at 100 ng/ml. All the constructs were re-confirmed by sequencing.Cell Transfections, FM4-64 Staining, and Treatment with Inhibitors—Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for 293T) or 1640 (for HeLa, MCF-7, GLC82, h-LAPM1, L78, and SPC-A1) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml amphicilin and 0.1% streptomycin. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 0.5 μg of plasmid DNAs were added per well in 24-well plate.FM4-64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was diluted with Me2SO to 1 μg/μl, added to each well (1 μl) in 24-well plates 12 h post-transfection, and the cells were photographed 24 h later.Brefeldin A (BFA) and LY290004 (Sigma) were prepared in Me2SO (5 mg/ml) and added to cells at the same time when cells were transfected. Cells were photographed 48 h post-transfection.Western Blotting, Immunofluorescence, and Electron Microscopy—Immunoblotting and immunofluoresentstaining were performed as described (19Cui P. Qin B. Liu N. Pan G. Pei D. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Images were acquired with a digital camera attached to Olympus CKX41 fluorescent microscope and processed with Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe System, San Jose, CA). Confocal images were acquired using Leica TCS SP2 Spectral Confocal System. For electron microscopy, cells was transfected with pCR3.1 and SNX10GFP, then fixed with gluteraldehyde (Sigma) 48 h post-transfection. Cells were then dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (60 nm) were cut, processed, and examined in the transmission electron microscope (at Southern China University of Agriculture, Guangzhou, China).RESULTSA Family-wide Screen for SNX Function Identified SNX10 as a Vacuolizing Factor in Mammalian Cells—We have previously shown that MT1-MMP is routed through early endosomes after internalization as a mechanism of down-regulation (18Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As a major sorting complex at the early endosomes, members of the SNX family may serve as regulators of MT-MMP activity in both normal and tumor cells. To this end, we cloned all known SNXs and assessed their ability to regulate MT1-MMP through a gain-of-function screen. We observed, unexpectedly, the formation of large vacuole-type vesicles in HeLa cells transfected with SNX10 but not any other SNXs (Fig. 1A, panels f and l versus a-e and g-k). Given the close relatedness among the SNXs (11Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), this specific effect of SNX10 suggests that SNX10 may have a unique cellular function related to endosome homeostasis. While the number and size of vacuoles may not be directly correlative to the intensity of SNX10-GFP expression (see the upper right corner of panel f, Fig. 1A), SNX10-GFP expression and vacuolation are tightly coupled in individual cells. To further elucidate the vacuolation process, we performed a time course study on individual cells and observed the appearance of vacuoles ∼4.5-6 h post-transfection (Fig. 1B, panels a-c). Vesicles of varying sizes appeared in the ensuring 7 h to reach a climax of one or a few giant vacuoles with concomitant disappearance of smaller vesicles (Fig. 1B, lanes c-f), suggesting that the large vesicles are formed by fusion of smaller ones continuously. Electron microscopy revealed that the vacuoles are mostly single membrane, and the large vacuole is formed through fusion of smaller ones at the periphery of the large vacuoles (Fig. 1C, panel b). The vacuolar membranes were stained with the lipophilic dye FM4-64 that were taken up through endocytosis, suggesting that these vacuoles are endosome-related (20Roberts R.L. Barbieri M.A. Pryse K.M. Chua M. Morisaki J.H. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D, panel b). We then screened multiple cell lines and found that SNX-10 is capable of mediating vacuolation in all cells tested (Fig. 1E, panels a-l). Thus, we concluded that the increased cellular activity of SNX10 perturbs the endosome homeostasis leading to the formation of giant vacuoles.Co-localization of SNX10 with Endosome Markers and Internalized EGFR—To further demonstrate that SNX10-induced vacuoles are derived from endosomes, we characterized the localization of known endosome markers in SNX10 induced vacuoles. First we co-transfected SNX10 with a known endosome marker FYVE-DsRed that contains the FYVE domain of EEA1 fused to DsRed (8Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). As shown in panels a-c of Fig. 2A, FYVE-DsRed is co-localized with SNX10 in small and intermediate vesicles. Interestingly, the membranes of large vacuoles have much lower levels of SNX10 or FYVE-DsRed, suggesting that at least the small and intermediate vesicles are endosome-like organelles. We also analyzed the co-localization of SNX10 and the PX-GFP fusion that has been used as an endosome marker. It is clear that SNX10 co-localizes almost 100% with that of PX-GFP (Fig. 2A, panels d-f). Finally, we performed internalization experiment for EGFR upon stimulation with EGF (100 ng/ml) and observed the co-localization of EGFR with SNX10 in the small vesicles mostly (Fig. 2B, panels a-c versus d-f), suggesting again that SNX10 is associated with early endosomes.FIGURE 2SNX10 co-localizes with endosome markers FYVE-DsRed and PX-GFP and the internalized EGFR. A, HeLa cells were co-transfected with SNX10 and marker genes. PX-GFP was transfected with SNX10-FLAG and immunostained with anti-FLAG antibody; FYVE-DsRed was co-transfected with SNX10GFP and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Note the significant co-localization signals in panels c and f. B, HeLa cells were transfected with SNX10GFP. After 24 h, cells were starved overnight and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 0 min (panels a-c) and 30 min (panels d-f). Cells were fixed and stained with rabbit anti-EGFR polyclonal antibody for the endogenous EGFR (red). Note the co-localization of EGFR and SNX10 in panels c and f. Bar represents 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The PI3P Binding Activity Is Required for SNX10-mediated Vacuolation—Members of the SNX family are proposed to mediate their physiological function via binding to PI3P on endosomes (15Carlton J. Bujny M. Rutherford A. Cullen P. Traffic. 2005; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To test if SNX10 functions through PI3P, we mutated the main PI3P binding residue Arg53 in SNX10 as predicted by homology modeling with yeast PX protein Grd19p (21Zhou C.Z. de La Sierra-Gallay I.L. Quevillon-Cheruel S. Collinet B. Minard P. Blondeau K. Henckes G. Aufrere R. Leulliot N. Graille M. Sorel I. de la Savarin P. Torre F. Poupon A. Janin J. van Tilbeurgh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50371-50376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, we also mutated a conserved Arg94, Arg99 in SNX10 (Fig. 3A). The mutants along with their wild type plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells and analyzed by Western blotting analysis as shown in Fig. 3B. All mutants were expressed as stable proteins as judged by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 3B, lanes 3-5). We then analyzed the ability of these mutants to induce vacuole formation in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, mutation at the main ligand binding residue Arg53 completely eliminated the ability of SNX10 to induce vacuole formation (Fig. 3C, panel c versus panel a). The secondary residue at Arg94 has a partial effect, while Lys79 has no effect on SNX10 (Fig. 3C, panels d and e versus b and Fig. 3D). These results suggest that SNX10 functions through its binding to the PI3P ligand on endosomes.FIGURE 3SNX10 mediates vacuolization through its PI3P binding domain. A, schematic diagram of three mutations in the PX domain of SNX10. B, wild-type and PX mutants of SNX10 expressed in HeLa cells as detected by Western blotting analysis probed with anti-FLAG antibody. C, vacuolizing activity of SNX10 and its three mutations. Note that R53A is negative, while K79A and R94A remain active. D, quantification of vacuoles per cell in C. Vacuoles in each of the transfected cell were counted and averaged. At least 100 cells were counted three times in each of the transfection and analyzed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Both the PX and CD Domains of SNX10 Are Required for Vacuolation—To dissect the structure-function of SNX10, we performed domain swap and deletion experiments with SNX3 as illustrated in Fig. 4A. Their PX domains share strong homology, and both belong to the simple SNX group without any other recognizable motifs or domains. Their products were analyzed by Western blotting, and the expected proteins were obtained with the GFP fusions presented in Fig. 4B. More importantly, their abilities to induce vacuole formation were analyzed in transfected cells and presented in Fig. 4C. First, the PX domain of SNX10 alone is not sufficient to illicit vacuole formation (Fig. 4C, panels h/k versus g/j), suggesting that the C-terminal domain or CD is also required for vacuole formation. Second, swapping the CD of SNX10 into SNX3 did not generate a vacuolizing chimera (Fig. 4C, panels c/f), suggesting that a close collaboration between the PX and CD domains is needed to orchestrate the vacuolation of the endosome in mammalian cells by SNX10.FIGURE 4Both PX and CD are required for the vacuolizing activity of SNX10. A, schematic diagram of CD truncations and swaps between SNX3 and SNX10. B, Western blot analysis of constructs in A expressed in HeLa cells. C, vacuolizing activity of deletion and chimera proteins in A. Note that neither CD deletion of SNX10 (panels h and k) nor CD swap with SNX3 (panels i and l) induced vacuoles like full-length SNX10 (panels g and j).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SNX10-induced Vacuolization Is Sensitive to BFA—SNX10 may induce the formation of these large vacuoles by either inhibiting the budding of vesicles from endosomes or accelerating the fusion of smaller vesicles to the growing endosomes. To gain insights into this process, we screened for small molecules that can either accelerate or inhibit the formation of vacuoles. Initially, we focused on compounds that known to impact the membrane trafficking process. Among the chemicals screened, brefeldin A specifically inhibited the formation of vacuoles in SNX10-GFP transfected cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5, panels c/f versus b/e and a/d). The rest of the chemicals including the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, LY290004 or wortmanin, which are known to inhibit morphogenesis of MVBs (22Futter C.E. Collinson L.M. Backer J.M. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), did not block the formation of vacuoles (data not shown), suggesting that the SNX10-mediated vacuolation is not dependent on phospholipids generated by the type I PI 3-kinases and the MVBs of the endosomal system (22Futter C.E. Collinson L.M. Backer J.M. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23Petiot A. Faure J. Stenmark H. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Given the fact that BFA targets Golgi-associated ARF-GEFs to inhibit the budding of vesicles from the Golgi complex (24Renault L. Guibert B. Cherfils J. Nature. 2003; 426: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that SNX10-induced vacuolization is also a Golgi-dependent process, perhaps, through the fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles with the endosomes.FIGURE 5Brefeldin A inhibits SNX10-mediated vacuolation. HeLa cells were transfected with SNX10GFP and treated with brefeldin A (panels b and e or c and f at 5 or 10 μm, respectively). Cells were photographed and presented to show that BFA inhibits vacuole formation in a dose-dependent manner.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe sorting nexins have attracted considerable attention due to their purported role in mediating sorting of cargos in intracellular vesicles, mostly endosomes by binding to the signature PI3P localized on endosomes (5Munro S.

Here we report a novel function for the SNX family by demonstrating the vacuolizing activity of SNX10. To our knowledge, this is the first reported function of this protein. As the mechanism that governs endosome homeostasis is poorly understood, the SNX10-mediated vacuolization may provide a model system to probe such mechanism.The endosome morphogenesis or maintenance may be mediated by a process or complex participated by SNX10 or its interacting proteins. Our observation may be the result of the perturbation of this perhaps “dedicated” rheostat-type mechanism by the increased activity of SNX10. One may argue that the observed vacuolation is an artifact generated by the overexpressed SNX10. While SNX10 needs to be expressed over the endogenous level to generate vacuoles as presented in this report, we also observed that cells began to form vacuoles before the SNX10-GFP became detectable and many cells with high levels of SNX10-GFP did not form any vacuole or only small vacuoles. 3B. Qin, M. He, X. Chen, and D. Pei, unpublished results. Yet, all cells that form vacuoles did express SNX10-GFP without any exception, suggesting that SNX10 is responsible for vacuolation. The precise mechanism for this discrepancy remains unknown. We speculate that SNX10 orchestrates vacuole formation by interacting with endogenous factors that regulate endosome size. One may argue that SNX10 may not be directly involved in regulating endosome formation. As such, we would predict that the targets of SNX10 are most likely involved in regulating endosome homeostasis in the mammalian cells.The origin of the observed vacuoles can be traced at least to the Golgi complex because they are sensitive to brefeldin A, an antifungal drug that inhibits the ARF-GEFs in the Golgi complex and known to disrupt the function of Golgi (24Renault L. Guibert B. Cherfils J. Nature. 2003; 426: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 25Mossessova E. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Mol.

Barbieri M.A. Pryse K.M. Chua M. Morisaki J.H. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), accumulated on the vacuole membranes (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the vacuoles are at least in part from endocytic vesicles, which is also corroborated by the internalized EGFR (Fig. 2). Consistently, BFA is also known to have similar effect on the endocytic pathway as it has on the Golgi complex (27Hunziker W. Whitney J.A. Mellman I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, a dominant negative mutant of dynamin K44A failed to block the formation of these vacuoles (data not shown), suggesting that other forms of endocytosis other than clathrin-coated pits may be responsible to deliver the endocytosed FM4-64 to the vacuoles. Given their easily scored phenotype, the vacuoles generated by SNX10 transfection may be a model system for studying organelle biogenesis and morphogenesis in mammalian cells. Eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells by the presence of membrane-enveloped organelles with distinct morphological features such as the nuclei, the Golgi complex, the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or chloroplasts in plants and those with less morphological characteristics such as secretory vesicles, endosomes, and lysosomes (1Dacks J.B. Doolittle W.F. Cell. 2001; 107: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These organelles help the cell establish an ordered structure within which its complex biochemical reactions and signaling processes are executed. Although highly compartmentalized, these organelles are interconnected through a network of vesicles shuttling between them to distribute important cargos among different compartments and deliver wastes for disposal in the cytosols or the lysosomes (2Matter K.

https://openalex.org/W2053888540,"The E2F family of transcription factors is believed to have an essential role in the control of cellular proliferation by regulating the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle progression. Previous work has demonstrated that the targeted inactivation of E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3 results in elevated p21CIP1 protein levels, loss of E2F target gene expression, and cell cycle arrest at G1/S and G2/M, suggesting a strict requirement for these E2Fs in the control of normal cellular proliferation. We now demonstrate that E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3 are also required for oncogene-mediated transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Analysis of synchronized populations of mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed that the inactivation of p21CIP1 restores the ability of E2f1-3-deficient cells to enter and transit through G1/S (but not G2/M). In contrast, loss of p53 restored the ability of these cells to progress through both G1/S and mitosis, leading to their continued proliferation. The inactivation of p53 (but not p21CIP1) rendered E2f1-3-deficient cells sensitive to transformation and tumorigenesis. These results suggest that the negative regulation of the p53-p21CIP1 axis by the E2F1-3 factors is critical for cell cycle progression and cellular transformation.

The timely entry and proper progression through the cell division cycle requires an ordered series of cyclin-dependent phosphorylation events and the execution of a well orchestrated transcriptional program. Growth factor-dependent activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) 3The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; TK, thymidine kinase; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. cdk4/6 and cdk2 results in the sequential phosphorylation of the Retinoblastoma (Rb) family of pocket proteins. This phosphorylation results in the release of E2F transcription factors from Rb-E2F complexes and activation of E2F target gene expression, leading to cell cycle progression (1Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 2Nevins J.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the temporal association with the Rb family of pocket proteins, E2F activity is also regulated through cell cycle-dependent expression, post-translational modifications, interactions with cofactors, and protein degradation (1Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 2Nevins J.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 3Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Several decades of work support the view that E2F represents an important activity that controls cellular proliferation (4Dimova D.K. Dyson N.J.

More recent studies suggest a particularly important role for the E2F3 family member in the control of gene expression during the G1/S transition. Inhibitory antibodies against E2F3 (but not E2F1) blocked the entry of cells into S phase (7Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, gene-targeting strategies in mice demonstrated a significant role for E2F3 in the proliferation of MEFs (8Humbert P.O. Verona R. Trimarchi J.M. Rogers C. Dandapani S.

Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Some functional redundancy among family members is apparent, however, as the combined inactivation of E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3 led to a much more profound proliferation arrest that was manifested at multiple stages of the cell cycle (9Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this block was accompanied by the induction of p53 transcriptional activity and the elevation of its target genes including p21CIP1 (9Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L.

These observations raise the possibility that E2F1-3 activators might regulate cdk activity through a p21CIP1-mediated negative feedback loop, which would then lead to the hypophosphorylation of Rb pocket proteins and the repression of E2F target genes (9Wu L.

It appears that the activation of p53 in E2f1-3-deficient cells is a relevant event for the control of the cell cycle because its ablation by mutation, viral oncogenes, or gene-targeting approaches mitigated the induction of p53 target genes and the block in cellular proliferation. 4C. Timmers, N. Sharma, R. Opavsky, B. Maiti, L. Wu, J. Wu, D. Orringer, P. Trikha, H. Saavedra, and G. Leone, submitted for publication. The specific role of p21CIP1 in this context, however, has yet to be determined. In the present study, we evaluated the role of E2f1-3 in the control of p21CIP1 expression during normal cellular proliferation and oncogene-mediated transformation. Our results demonstrate an important role for the control of the p53-p21CIP1 axis by E2f1-3 in cell cycle progression and oncogene-mediated transformation. Cell Culture—Primary MEFs were isolated from embryonic day 13.5 embryos using standard methods (9Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). All cells were cultured in DMEM with 15% fetal bovine serum. To bring cells to quiescence, cultures at 40-50% confluency were incubated in DMEM containing 0.2% serum for 60 h. Synchronized cells were then stimulated to proliferate by the addition of DMEM supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. Cells were collected at different time points after serum stimulation and were processed for BrdUrd incorporation and real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays. Retroviral Infections—The cDNAs for Myc and Ras61L were subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI and BamHI/EcoRI sites respectively of the pBABE-hygromycin retroviral vector. The cre recombinase cDNA was subcloned into the SnaBI site of the pBABE retroviral vector containing either a puromycin (pBABE-puro) or hygromycin (pBABE-hygro) resistance gene. High titer retroviruses were produced by transient transfection of retroviral constructs into the Phoenix-Eco packaging cell line as described previously (13Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). MEFs were infected three times at 12-h intervals with Phoenix cell supernatants containing 4 μg ml-1 of Sequabrene (Sigma). Infected cells were then selected for a total of 2-5 days in the presence of 2.5 μg ml-1 of puromycin and/or 200 μg ml-1 of hygromycin. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—For BrdUrd incorporation assays, serum-stimulated cells were incubated with BrdUrd for 2 h before harvesting and subsequently fixed with methanol and acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. Cells were then stained in 35-mm dishes with α-BrdUrd antibody (Ab-3, Oncogene) as previously described (14Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. At least 500 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-positive nuclei/35-mm plate were scored for each time point. Colony Formation Assays—MEFs were infected with supernatants containing various retroviruses as indicated in the legends to Figs. 1, 4, and 5. Cells were then plated at a density of 1000, 2500, and 5000 cells/100-mm plate. The cells were cultured in DMEM with 15% fetal bovine serum for 2 weeks and were then fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with 5 mg/ml crystal violet in 20% methanol. Colonies from three separate plates at the appropriate density were counted, and the mean±S.D. from one representative experiment is reported unless otherwise stated. Single colonies were isolated from parallel plated 96-well culture plates, and genomic DNA was collected and genotyped by PCR.FIGURE 4Loss of p53 rescues the transforming capacity of 123f/f cells and leads to tumor formation in nude mice. p53f/f123f/f and p53-/-1-/-2-/- primary cells were first infected with retroviruses expressing the Myc and Ras61L oncogenes and then infected with either control (-)- or cre (+)-expressing retroviruses as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, representative pictures of crystal violet-stained colonies with the selected genotypes are shown.

The appearance of wild-type E2f3- and p53-specific bands in samples derived from tumors is due to the presence of contaminating peripheral blood cells. The floxed allele (E2f3f/f) produces a 184-bp PCR fragment, and the knock-out E2f3 allele produces a 416-bp fragment. The p53 wild-type and knock-out alleles produce 460- and 612-bp fragments, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Loss of p21CIP1 in E2f1-3-deficient MEFs does not lead to tumor formation in nude mice. p21-/- 123f/f primary cells were treated as described in Fig. 1.

Myc- and Ras61L-transformed primary MEFs of various genotypes, as indicated in the legends to Figs. 2, 4, and 5, were harvested, counted, and resuspended in serum-free DMEM at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. 100 μl of cells were injected subcutaneously into the right and left shoulders and hips of each mouse; i.e. four injections were administered per mouse. Tumor volume was determined every three days by measuring their maximum length, width, and height using a digital Vernier caliper. The mice were sacrificed once the tumor masses affected the health of the animals. The latency was determined as the period of time required for 50% of the injection sites to form tumors having a volume of 5 mm3. Tumor studies were performed in three independent experiments, and representative data is shown. Real-time PCR Analysis—Approximately 1 × 106 cells were harvested at the indicated time points, and total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNA miniprep columns as described by the manufacturer, including a DNase treatment before elution from the column. Reverse transcription of 2 μg of the total RNA was performed by combining 1 μl of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 4 μl of 10× buffer, 0.5 μl of 100 mm oligo(dT) primer, 0.5 μl of 25 mm dNTPs, 1.0 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1.0 μl of RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and water up to a volume of 20 μl. The reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 60 min and then diluted 5-fold with 80 μl of water. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the Bio-Rad iCycler PCR machine. Each PCR reaction contained 0.5 μl of cDNA template and primers at a concentration of 100 nm in a final volume of 25 μl of SYBR Green reaction mix (Bio-Rad). Reactions were performed in triplicate, and relative amounts of cDNA were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Briefly, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with blocking buffer containing 1% goat serum for 30 min. The cells were then incubated in blocking buffer containing a 1:500 dilution of primary antibody (NCL-p53-CM5p, Novocastra) for 1 h and rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated with a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa dye conjugate (Invitrogen and Molecular Probes, respectively) for 1 h and rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, after which they were counter-stained with Hoechst and mounted using Gel/Mount (Biomed, Foster City, CA). E2f1-3 Are Required for Oncogene-mediated Transformation— Previous experiments have shown that E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3 are essential for the proliferation of primary and established MEFs. Our recent observations demonstrating that the inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor restores the ability of E2f1-3-deficient cells to proliferate raised the possibility that oncogenic insults other than the loss of p53 tumor suppressor function might also relieve the strict requirement for E2f1-3 in cell proliferation.4 We reasoned that the introduction of transforming oncogenes might alter similar or related pathways disrupted by the loss of p53 and help drive the transformation of MEFs. To test this possibility, early passage primary E2f1-/-E2f2-/-E2f3f/f MEFs (123f/f) were first infected with retroviral vectors that contain a hygromycin selection cassette and express Myc and an activated form of Ras (Ras61L). After selection with hygromycin, the cells were further infected with retroviruses that coexpress the cre recombinase along with a puromycin selection cassette. After two days of selection with puromycin, protein lysates were harvested, and consistent with our previous reports, cre expression in 123f/f MEFs resulted in the loss of both E2F3a and E2F3b proteins (Fig. 1A). The ability of Myc-Ras61L-overexpressing E2f1-3-deficient MEFs to be transformed was analyzed by colony formation (15Latres E. Malumbres M. Sotillo R. Martin J. Ortega S. Martin-Caballero J.

As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, cre treatment of 123f/f MEFs led to a pronounced decrease in the number of transformed foci; the few foci that did form (Fig. 1C, ***) contained at least one non-deleted E2f3f allele (Fig. 1D). The potential of primary 123f/f MEFs to be transformed was also tested in nude mice assays. To this end, Myc-Ras61L-overexpressing 123f/f MEFs were treated with control- or cre-expressing retroviruses (as described above) and injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor progression was monitored every three days over a period of two months. Myc and Ras61L expression in control-treated cells gave rise to tumors in 75% of the injected sites by three weeks (Fig. 2A). By one month, mice had to be sacrificed, as all of the sites injected contained rapidly growing tumors with a mean tumor volume of 989 mm3 (Fig. 2, B and C). Cre expression in Myc-Ras61L-transformed 123f/f MEFs significantly increased the time of tumor onset and decreased tumor burden relative to control-treated cells. By the end of two months, only 55% of these injected sites had given rise to tumors. PCR analysis demonstrated that, although >95% of the cre-infected cell population injected into nude mice were deleted for E2f3, 100% of the tumors that eventually developed arose from non-deleted cells (Fig. 2D). Together, these results demonstrate a strict requirement for E2f1-3 in cellular transformation. Loss of E2f1-3 Leads to Activation of p53 Target Genes and Localization of p53 in the Nucleus—As we have previously shown, real-time PCR analysis of gene expression showed a marked overall reduction of E2F target genes upon ablation of E2f1-3 (Fig. 3A). Because p21CIP1 is a known transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor, we explored whether other p53-regulated genes were also induced in E2f1-3-deleted cells. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that numerous p53 targets, including killer/dr5, gadd, pidd, and noxa, were significantly elevated in E2f1-3-deficient cells along with p21CIP1 (Fig. 3B).4 These results suggest that, in addition to a decrease in E2F target gene expression, loss of E2f1-3 leads to the activation of p53 transcriptional activity. Consistent with these observations, loss of E2f1-3 resulted in an increase of nuclear localized p53 protein (Fig. 3C). Together, these results suggest that the activation of a p53-dependent transcription program may contribute to the resistance of E2f1-3-deficient cells to be transformed by the Myc and Ras61L oncogenes. Loss of p53 (but Not p21CIP1) Renders E2f1-3-deficient MEFs Competent for Transformation—Considering our recent observations indicating that the inactivation of p53 restores the ability of E2f1-3-eficient cells to proliferate, we sought to assess whether the loss of p53 might also render these cells sensitive to oncogene-mediated transformation. To this end, we intercrossed mice containing a conditional allele of p53 (p53f/f) with E2f1-/-E2f2-/-E2f3f/f mice and generated several p53f/fE2f1-/-E2f2-/-E2f3f/f primary MEF lines (p53f/f 123f/f). The capacity of these cells to be transformed by Myc-Ras61L was tested in a similar manner as described above. In contrast to cre-treated 123f/f MEFs, both control- and cre-treated p53f/f123f/f MEFs could be transformed in response to Myc and Ras61L overexpression (Fig. 4, A and B). As shown in Fig. 4B, the capacity of cre-treated Myc-Ras61L-overexpressing p53f/f123f/f MEFs to form transformed foci was comparable with either control-treated p53f/f123f/f or cre-treated p53-/- E2f1-/-E2f2-/- (p53-/-1-/-2-/-) MEFs. PCR analysis of individual colonies confirmed that most colonies that formed were deleted for both E2f3 and p53 (∼90%); a few of the colonies were deleted for p53 only (∼10%), but no colonies were found to be deleted for E2f3 only (data not shown). Moreover, the injection of cre-treated Myc-Ras61L-transformed p53f/f 123f/f MEFs into nude mice gave rise to tumors in 100% of the injected sites by week 2 (Fig. 4D). PCR genotyping confirmed the ablation of both p53 and E2f3 in the vast majority of these tumors (Fig. 4E). These cells gave rise to aggressive tumors with a similar latency as Myc-Ras61L-transformed cre-treated p53-/-1-/-2-/- MEFs. In either case, transformation of cre-treated p53f/f123f/f or p53-/-1-/-2-/- MEFs gave rise to tumors significantly earlier than control-treated 123f/f MEFs (compare Figs. 2A and 4C). Hence, both colony and tumor assays in nude mice revealed that the loss of p53 resensitized E2f1-3-deficient cells to oncogene-mediated transformation. We then assessed whether the specific induction of p21CIP1 expression in E2f1-3-deficient cells might be responsible for the inability of these cells to be transformed. By similar experimental strategies as described above, we intercrossed mice containing a null allele of p21CIP1 (p21-/-) with E2f1-/-E2f2-/-E2f3f/f mice, generated several p21-/-E2f1-/-E2f2-/-E2f3f/f primary MEF lines (p21-/-123f/f), and tested the capacity of these cells to be transformed by Myc and Ras61L. As for 123f/f MEFs, cre treatment of p21-/-123f/f MEFs abrogated the capacity of these cells to form transformed foci in vitro and form tumors in vivo (Fig. 5, A-C). Indeed, the expression of cre in Myc-Ras61L-transformed p21-/-123f/f MEFs resulted in a marked delay in tumor onset relative to control-treated cells (39 versus 27 days, respectively). By the end of two months, only 22% of the sites injected with cre-treated cells gave rise to tumors, and all of the tumors that arose originated from non-deleted cells (Fig. 5, D and E). These results demonstrate that, in contrast to the loss of p53, the inactivation of p21CIP1 is not sufficient to bypass the requirement for E2f1-3 in transformation. Together, these data suggest that E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3 play an essential role in transformation and tumorigenesis and highlight the dramatic influence that p53 has on whether these E2Fs are required for tumor initiation and progression. Inactivation of p21CIP1 Restores the Ability of E2f1-3-deficient MEFs to Enter S Phase—We then explored why the loss of p53 (but not p21CIP1) impacted the transformation of E2f1-3-deficient cells. We initially assessed the ability of control- and cre-treated 123f/f, p53f/f123f/f, and p21-/-123f/f MEFs to respond to mitotic stimuli. To this end, 123f/f, p53f/f123f/f, and p21-/-123f/f MEFs were infected with control- or cre-expressing retroviruses, selected with puromycin, incubated in medium containing 0.2% serum for 60 h, and then restimulated with medium containing 15% serum. As determined by PCR-based genotyping assays, the expression of cre in each case led to the efficient deletion of the conditional E2f3 allele (Fig. 6B). Consistent with previous results (9Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), the cre-mediated ablation of E2f3 from 123f/f MEFs prevented cell cycle entry, as measured by BrdUrd assays (Fig. 6A). Surprisingly, the loss of either p53 or p21CIP1 restored the ability of quiescent E2f1-3-deficient cells to enter S phase. The status of E2F target gene expression in these cells was measured by real-time PCR assays. As expected, loss of E2f1-3 prevented the induction of various E2F-responsive genes known to have important functions in the G1/S and G2/M transitions (cdc6, dhfr, mcm3, pol α, tk, cyclin B1, cyclin A2, and mad2). Importantly, the entry of cre-treated p53f/f123f/f and p21-/-123f/f MEFs into S phase was accompanied by the induction of most E2F-responsive genes (Fig. 6C and data not shown). These results demonstrate that E2F target gene expression is dependent on the status of the p53 and p21CIP1 pathway and suggest that the negative regulation of the p53-p21CIP1 axis by E2F1-3 is critical for the transition of cells through G1/S. Inactivation of p53 (but Not p21CIP1) Restores the Capacity of E2f1-3-deficient MEFs to Proliferate—Previous work has demonstrated that cells deficient for E2f1-3 arrest at G1/S and at other stages of the cell cycle, including G2/M (9Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that the negative regulation of the p53-p21CIP1 axis by E2F1-3 also impacts the transition of cells through mitosis, we measured the mitotic index in control- and cre-treated unsynchronized 123f/f, p53f/f123f/f, and p21-/-123f/f MEFs. The number of mitotic cells was determined by counting at least 2000 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei. The data presented in Fig. 6D demonstrates that cre-treated 123f/f MEFs failed to undergo mitosis. Importantly, the inactivation of p53 (but not p21CIP1) in E2f1-3-deficient cells suppressed the mitotic block in these cells. From these experiments, we conclude that the activation of p21CIP1 in E2f1-3-deficient cells represents only one arm of the p53-dependent program that blocks the proliferation of these cells. Given that p21-/- and E2f1-3-deficient cells can respond to serum, leading to the induction of a number of E2F target genes, we would suggest that E2F1-3 influence gene expression at G1/S and G2/M by p21CIP1-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. A large body of work in plants, insects, and mammals has demonstrated a critical role for E2F activators in the control of cellular proliferation (9Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L.

These targets are diverse and include gene products whose activities control DNA replication, such as Cyclin A2, Cdc6, and Mcms, as well as products involved in DNA repair and G2/M transitions, such as Cdc25a and String. The analysis of MEFs deficient for the entire E2F activator subclass suggests that the control of many of these target genes by E2F1-3 might involve the regulation of a p21CIP1-dependent feedback loop (9Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In this study, gene-targeting approaches were used to evaluate the role of E2f1-3 and p21CIP1 during normal cellular proliferation and oncogene-mediated transformation. Several observations suggest that the induction of p21CIP1 in E2f1-3-deficient cells is likely an important p53-regulated event contributing to the inhibition of E2F target gene expression and the block at G1/S. First, loss of p53 prevents the induction of p21CIP1 expression and restores cdk activity in E2f1-3-deficient cells.4 This leads to Rb phosphorylation, the expression of E2F targets, and continued proliferation. Second, the reactivation of cdk activity by the overexpression of cyclin E/cdk2 can promote the stimulation of quiescent E2f1-3-deficient cells to transiently re-enter the cell cycle and replicate their DNA (9Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Finally, the targeted inactivation of p21CIP1 in cells deficient for E2f1-3, as shown by the work presented here, restores the G1/S-specific induction of E2F target genes and the entry of cells into S phase. These data suggest that regulation of the p53-p21CIP1 axis by E2F1-3 is important for the transition of cells through G1/S. Thus, it appears that the function of E2F1-3 in controlling the G1/S transition is mediated, at least in part, by the p53-mediated regulation of p21CIP1. The fact that deletion of p21CIP1 does not fully rescue the growth defect in E2f1-3-deficient cells, however, suggests that other p53 target genes may be involved in controlling the passage of cells through S phase and G2/M. Part of the mechanism by which the induction of p53 may block cells at the G2/M transition could involve the activation of Gadd45 and 14-3-3, two targets with known functions in the regulation of Cdc2 activity (26Taylor W. Stark G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). The identification of the critical E2F1-3-regulated targets involved in the transition of cells through S and G2/M would be of future interest. It is commonly believed that E2F is an activity intimately linked to cell cycle progression by virtue of its function in regulating the expression of various components necessary for DNA replication and cell cycle progression. The above results demonstrating that cells can proliferate in the absence of E2F activators challenges this view. We suggest that E2F transcription is an activity that integrates various mitogenic signaling events to coordinate the proper execution of the cell cycle transcriptional program. This E2F-mediated program includes the regulation of gene expression through both positive (activation) and negative (repression) regulation. E2F activators can thus be viewed to coordinate transcriptional activation in conjunction with transcriptional repression via a p53-dependent pathway. The results presented here argue that E2F1-3 control a p53-p21CIP1-dependent mechanism that controls E2F-mediated repression and that this feedback mechanism is critical for normal cellular proliferation and transformation. The data presented in this manuscript have significant implications for future cancer therapies. It has previously been demonstrated that overexpression of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a can induce quiescent cells to enter the cell cycle, and each has oncogenic activity in primary murine fibroblasts (22DeGregori J.

In some human cancers, E2F3 is found to be amplified or overexpressed, suggesting an important role for this particular family member in human malignancies (32Feber A. Clark J. Goodwin G. Dodson A.R.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5616-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We show here a remarkable difference between the transforming potential of E2f1-3-deficient cells having or lacking p53. Indeed, E2f1-3 function has little effect on the tumorigenic potential of p53-null cells. These results predict that future therapeutic strategies that target E2F1-3 in cancer will only be effective in tumor cells with an intact p53 gene. These results also predict that mutation of p53 may eliminate the need for subsequent genetic or epigenetic alterations that inactivate the Rb pathway and lead to increased E2F1-3 activity. Indeed, our results provide an explanation for previous observations showing that the Rb-inactivating function of the polyomavirus large T oncoprotein is not required for the transformation of primary cells deficient for the p19ARF tumor suppressor gene (11Chao H.H. Buchmann A.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7624-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In summary, by using a conditional approach to ablate gene function, we have revealed a critical and unexpected role for E2F in the control of a p53-dependent checkpoint, opening the possibility that the requirement for E2F function during development and cancer may not be universal but rather restricted to certain cellular contexts. We propose that the success of strategies designed to block the proliferation of cancer cells by inhibiting E2F1-3 function will therefore be dependent on the status of the p53 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2062051904,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been implicated in neuronal survival and death. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms involved in COX-2 function are unclear. In the present study we found that COX-2 is induced in response to glutathione depletion-induced oxidative stress in primary cortical neurons. Two proximal specific Sp1 and Sp3 binding sites are responsible for the COX-2 promoter activity under normal as well as oxidative stress conditions through enhanced Sp1 and Sp3 DNA binding activity. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that -268/-267 positions serve as specific Sp1 and Sp3 recognition sites under oxidative stress. Enforced expression of Sp1 and Sp3 using HSV vectors increased the promoter activity, transcription, and protein level of COX-2 in cortical neurons. The dominant negative form of Sp1 abrogated the oxidative stress-induced promoter activity and expression of COX-2. We also demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated COX-2 gene delivery protected neurons from DNA damage induced by oxidative, genotoxic, and excitotoxic stresses and by ischemic injury. Moreover, COX-2(-/-) cortical neurons were more susceptible to DNA damage-induced cell death. These results indicate that in primary neurons Sp1 and Sp3 play an essential role in the modulation of COX-2 transcription, which mediates neuronal homeostasis and survival by preventing DNA damage in response to neuronal stress."

The SecYEG complex was purified on the cobalt-chelating TALON resin (Clontech) via His-tagged SecE. To this end, INVs were prepared from TY0 (MC4100, ompT::kan zhd-33::Tn10 rpsE) (34Matsumoto G.

INVs (2 mg of protein/ml) were solubilized by 1% dodecyl maltoside (Sigma), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and the solubilized membrane proteins were bound to TALON, which was washed with the same buffer containing 0.02% dodecyl maltoside. The SecYEG complex was eluted with 50 mm imidazole in wash buffer and concentrated by ultrafiltration. E. coli polar phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. DAG was enzymatically prepared by treating sonicated liposomes (10 mg/ml) made of polar phospholipids with phospholipase C (100 u/ml) (Sigma) in 50 mm triethanolamine acetate (TEA-OAc), pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, at 37°C for 1 h. DAG thus generated was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) followed by evaporation. Liposomes containing DAG were prepared as follows. Phospholipids (20 mg/ml) and DAG (5 mg/ml), each dissolved in chloroform, were mixed to obtain the specified content of DAG followed by evaporation. To this dried lipid mixture, buffer A (50 mm Tea-OAc, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added to give the concentration of 10 mg of phospholipids/ml, and then liposomes were formed by bath sonication.

Reconstitution of Proteoliposomes and in Vitro Integration Reactions—Proteoliposomes were reconstituted as follows. Sonicated liposomes (200 μg) were solubilized in 50 μl of buffer A containing 1.5% OG and then mixed with solubilized membrane proteins. The total volume was adjusted to 100–150 μl using buffer A containing 1.5% OG. After incubation on ice for 20 min, OG was removed by dialysis against 500 ml of buffer A for at least 3 h at 4 °C to allow the formation of proteoliposomes. The proteoliposome suspension thus prepared was diluted with 0.9 ml of buffer A, followed by centrifugation (170,000 × g, for 1 h at 4 °C) to sediment proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes were then resuspended in 50 μl of buffer A and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Before use, the suspension was thawed at room temperature and then sonicated to form proteoliposomes again (32Akimaru J. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6545-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A 2.5-μl aliquot was used in a 25-μl integration reaction. In vitro synthesis of membrane proteins was performed for 30 min at 37 °C by a reconstituted system composed of fractionated cytosolic translation factors, salt-washed ribosomes, and initiation factor 2 (24Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Concentrations of magnesium acetate and potassium acetate were changed from 10 and 70 mm to 7.5 and 150 mm, respectively. Polyethylene glycol was omitted. Spermidine concentration was changed from 0.8 to 2.4 mm. These conditions were necessary to prevent aggregation of liposomes. SecA, Ffh, and FtsY were added from the beginning of the reactions. Following synthesis, reaction mixtures (50 μl) were divided into two halves. One-half directly received trichloroacetic acid (5%), and the other half was mixed with an equal volume of PK (1 mg/ml) and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Radioactive translation products were separated on SDS gels and visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of the Factor—INVs (∼1 g of protein) prepared from E. coli strain MC4100 were treated with 5 m urea in 50 mm Tea-OAc, pH 7.5, for 20 min on ice at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Urea-washed INVs were collected at 170,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, resuspended at 2 mg/ml in 6% sodium cholate (Sigma), 50 mm Tea-OAc, pH 7.5, and spun again. About one-third of the total membrane protein was recovered from the supernatant. Cholate was removed by acetone precipitation (4 volumes of acetone, 30 min at –20 °C). Precipitates were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) and washed successively with acetone and diethyl ether, and dry precipitates were resuspended in 15 ml of buffer B (1.5% OG, 50 mm Tea-OAc, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was mixed with 0.5 volume of 30% trichloroacetic acid and incubated on ice for 30 min. The trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C was precipitated with 10 volumes of acetone to remove trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) were washed with acetone and diethyl ether and dissolved in 5 ml of 1.5% OG, 20 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 5.8, 10% glycerol. The solution was applied to a Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Active fractions as to integration of H5 procoat were determined after reconstitution of each fraction into proteoliposomes. The activity eluted at ∼0.2 m NaCl. Active fractions were combined and further separated by gel filtration chromatography using Superose 12 (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was developed at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The activity eluted at ∼70 kDa. The active fractions were combined and used as the purified factor. The protein concentration determined according to Ref. 39Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar was 2.8-fold lower than the weight of the dry acetone pellets and was therefore corrected by this value. The factor from D31m4 was purified as follows. INVs washed with urea were treated with 6% cholate as described above. The integration activity was recovered from the cholate-washed INVs. Cholate-washed INVs were then solubilized in buffer B, followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The solubilized membrane was then treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction thus obtained was concentrated and subjected to column chromatography as described above. Other Methods—SDS-PAGE was performed as described (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). For the analysis of proOmpA D26 the HI gel system (38Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3707-3712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for M13 procoat and the factor an HI gel containing 6 m urea were used. Immunoblotting was performed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) as described (41Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7170-7176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nile blue and Sudan black were used at 30 and 700 μg/ml. Glycan was detected using a glycan detection system (Roche Diagnostics). Spontaneous Protein Integration into Phospholipids Is Prevented by DAG—When MtlA is synthesized in vitro in the presence of native inverted, inner membrane vesicles (INVs), proteinase K (PK) digestion leaves behind a 30-kDa MPF (Fig. 1, A and B). This fragment, which is also obtained from MtlA assembled in vivo (42Stephan M.M. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8230-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), has been shown by multiple criteria to reliably indicate correct membrane integration and not to reflect any kind of aggregation nor misfolding (24Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Koch H.G. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Werner P.K. Saier Jr., M.H. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24523-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the same MPF was obtained when INVs were replaced by liposomes composed only of E. coli polar phospholipids, and its formation was even stimulated 2-fold by the addition of Ffh and FtsY (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the liposome-mediated MPF was really the result of membrane integration, the liposomes were extracted with 5 m urea, 1 m potassium acetate, and 1.5% octyl glucoside (OG) after MtlA synthesis (Fig. 1C). The appearance of the MPF was resistant toward extraction with urea and high salt but was abolished by prior solubilization with detergent, collectively indicating that the MPF resulted from lipid integration of MtlA. The MPF was, however, not observed when liposomes were added post-translationally (Fig. 1C). All together these findings are consistent with a synthesis-coupled spontaneous integration of MtlA into these liposomes. In contrast, previous observations indicated that MtlA integration strictly depends on SecYE (25Koch H.G. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This is supported by experiments depicted in Fig. 1D. The MtlA integration activity of INVs could partially be recovered after total INV proteins were first solubilized with OG and then reconstituted back into proteoliposomes by removal of the detergent. Integration of MtlA into these proteoliposomes was stimulated by Ffh/FtsY and reached a substantial level when SecYEG-overproducing INVs were used for solubilization, whereas YidC did not seem to be required. The formation of MtlA-MPF was, however, not observed when proteoliposomes had been reconstituted from SecE-deficient INVs. This latter finding suggested the presence of some component in these proteoliposomes reconstituted from total INV proteins, which prevented a spontaneous integration of MtlA. We therefore examined several membrane components and found that DAG, which is a physiological constituent of E. coli membranes, reduces the spontaneous integration of MtlA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). Alteration of the phospholipid composition in liposomes did not cause any significant changes in the integration (data not shown), suggesting a specific role of DAG. Moreover, although the spontaneous integration was stimulated by Ffh and FtsY (Fig. 1, B and E), presumably because of some antifolding activity of Ffh, no such effect was detected in the presence of more than 5% DAG (Fig. 1E). Spontaneous membrane integration was originally described for M13 procoat protein (8Geller B.L. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has the membrane topology depicted in Fig. 1F. We therefore examined if DAG would also in this case reduce spontaneous integration (Fig. 1G). We used the H5 mutant of the M13 procoat, which is integrated in the same manner as wild type M13 procoat except that its signal sequence cannot be cleaved (44Soekarjo M. Eisenhawer M. Kuhn A. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The integration of H5 procoat can be analyzed also via the appearance of an MPF (45Angelini S. Deitermann S. Koch H.G. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which is slightly smaller than the non-PK-treated form (Fig. 1G, asterisk). By this criteria, ∼20% of H5 procoat was found spontaneously integrated into DAG-free liposomes as compared with ∼30% into native INVs (Fig. 1G). The amount of the spontaneously integrating H5 procoat was also drastically reduced when the DAG content of liposomes was increased. We therefore conclude that DAG generally prevents the spontaneous integration of proteins into E. coli phospholipids, and hereafter we used 5% DAG when reconstituting proteoliposomes. A Reconstitution System for Membrane Protein Integration—With DAG-containing liposomes now at hand as a negative control for the reconstitution of MtlA membrane integration, we examined the effect of purified SecYEG and/or YidC. However, no MtlA-MPF was obtained when proteoliposomes were reconstituted from SecYEG and YidC alone or in combination, even if Ffh and FtsY were present (Fig. 2A). These results were indicative of a missing integration factor, and we therefore set out to isolate such a component from INVs. As a first step, urea-washed INVs were extracted with sodium cholate. The cholate extract precipitated with acetone and solubilized in OG did not contain detectable amounts of SecYE, SecD, and YidC (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, the extracted material when reconstituted into proteoliposomes per se was inactive in MtlA integration (Fig. 2C). However, when the cholate extract and SecYEG were co-reconstituted, significant MtlA integration was observed, indicating that the cholate extract contained an integration activity complementing SecYEG. Again YidC did not further increase the MtlA integration efficiency. It has been reported recently that in addition to the membrane potential (46Kuhn A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15914-15918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), YidC is required for the integration of M13 procoat (13Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These dependences are verified in Fig. 2D, where H5 procoat was integrated into INVs from strain JS7131 at wild type level (cf. strain MC4100), as long as YidC had been expressed from an arabinose-inducible promoter (compare JS7131/arabinose with JS7131/glucose). Integration of H5 procoat into YidC-containing INVs was reduced by 50% when DCCD was added to inhibit the ATP-dependent generation of an H+ gradient (47Müller M. Fisher R.P. Rienhofer-Schweer A. Hoffschulte H.K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3855-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). With YidC-depleted vesicles, however, the DCCD effect was only marginal. H5 procoat integration was also observed for proteoliposomes reconstituted only with the cholate extract (Fig. 2E) with an efficiency that was comparable with that of INVs depleted of YidC and the membrane potential (Fig. 2D). Neither the co-reconstitution of the cholate extract with SecYEG nor with YidC had a stimulatory effect on the H5 procoat integration (data not shown). From these results we concluded that the cholate extract contained some hydrophobic compound that stimulates membrane protein integration both in the presence and absence of SecYEG. Because a basal level of H5 procoat integration was obtained with liposomes reconstituted only from the cholate extract, this integration stimulating activity was exploited as an assay to follow purification of the active compound. The cholate extract was prepared from urea-treated INVs and washed with acetone and diethyl ether to remove cholate and bulk lipids. After solubilization in 1.5% OG, the solution was treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, because we found that in the presence of OG the integration stimulating activity was recovered from the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction. This fraction was precipitated with acetone to remove trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone and diethyl ether, dissolved in 1.5% OG, and subjected to anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q. The activity was recovered at ∼0.2 m NaCl. Active fractions were combined and subjected to gel filtration on Superose 12. The activity coeluted from Superose 12 at ∼70 kDa with a single species that displayed a molecular mass of 8–10 kDa on denaturing PAGE (see below). Activities of the Isolated Factor—We first investigated an involvement of the purified factor in the integration of MtlA. Proteoliposomes containing both SecYEG and the factor in fact revealed the highest integration activity of MtlA (Fig. 3A). In contrast to H5 procoat, no integration of MtlA into proteoliposomes containing only the factor was obtained, ruling out the possibility that the factor restores spontaneous integration to DAG-harboring liposomes. The SecYEG- and factor-dependent integration of MtlA was clearly stimulated by the addition of Ffh and FtsY. The fact that it proceeded to some extent in the absence of added Ffh and FtsY is most likely because of residual amounts of these proteins in the fractionated cell extract used for in vitro synthesis (24Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we tested the integration of Momp2 (Fig. 3, B and C), which is a model membrane protein composed of the first membrane spanning domain of MtlA and the mature part of OmpA. Following integration, Momp2 remains membrane-anchored by its single transmembrane domain exposing OmpA at the periplasmic surface (Fig. 3B). Topogenesis of Momp2 does not only involve Ffh/FtsY and SecYEG but also SecA to transl"
https://openalex.org/W2042267093,"Reactive astrogliosis is the gliotic response to brain injury with activated astrocytes and microglia being the major effector cells. These cells secrete inflammatory cytokines, proteinases, and proteinase inhibitors that influence extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. In astrocytes, the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) is up-regulated by interleukin-1 (IL-1), which is a major neuroinflammatory cytokine. We report that IL-1 activates TIMP-1 expression via both the IKK/NF-κB and MEK3/6/p38/ATF-2 pathways in astrocytes. The activation of the <i>TIMP-1</i> gene can be blocked by using pharmacological inhibitors, including BAY11-7082 and SB202190, overexpression of the dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBαSR), or by the knock-down of p65 subunit of NF-κB. Binding of activated NF-κB (p50/p65 heterodimer) and ATF-2 (homodimer) to two novel regulatory elements located –2.7 and –2.2 kb upstream of the TIMP-1 transcription start site, respectively, is required for full IL-1-responsiveness. Mutational analysis of these regulatory elements and their weak activity when linked to the minimal <i>tk</i> promoter suggest that cooperative binding is required to activate transcription. In contrast to astrocytes, we observed that TIMP-1 is expressed at lower levels in gliomas and is not regulated by IL-1. We provide evidence that the lack of TIMP-1 activation in gliomas results from either dysfunctional IKK/NF-κB or MEK3/6/p38/ATF-2 activation by IL-1. In summary, we propose a novel mechanism of TIMP-1 regulation, which ensures an increased supply of the inhibitor after brain injury, and limits ECM degradation. This mechanism does not function in gliomas, and may in part explain the increased invasiveness of glioma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2071358091,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can be stimulated by several Gs-coupled receptors, but the precise mechanism of action has not yet been elucidated. We therefore examined the ability of GαsQ226L (GαsQL), a constitutively active mutant of Gαs, to stimulate STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Apart from GαsQL, the stimulation of Gαs by cholera toxin or β2-adrenergic receptor and the activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin, (Sp)-cAMP, or dibutyryl-cAMP all promoted both STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations. Moreover, the removal of Gαs by RNA interference significantly reduced the β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated STAT3 phosphorylations, denoting its capacity to regulate STAT3 activation by a G protein-coupled receptor. The possible downstream signaling molecules involved were assessed by using specific inhibitors and dominant negative mutants. Induction of STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations by GαsQL was suppressed by inhibition of protein kinase A, Janus kinase 2/3, Rac1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and a similar profile was observed in response to β2-adrenergic receptor stimulation. In contrast to the Gα16-mediated regulation of STAT3 in HEK 293 cells (Lo, R. K., Cheung, H., and Wong, Y. H. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 52154–52165), the Gαs-mediated responses, including STAT3-driven luciferase activation, were resistant to inhibition of phospholipase Cβ. Surprisingly, Gαs-mediated phosphorylation at Tyr705, but not at Ser727, was resistant to inhibition of c-Src, Raf-1, and MEK1/2 as well as to the expression of dominant negative Ras. Therefore, as with other Gα-mediated activations of STAT3, the stimulatory signal arising from Gαs is transduced via multiple signaling pathways. However, unlike the mechanisms employed by Gαi and Gα14/16, Gαs distinctively requires protein kinase A, JNK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase for STAT3 activation. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can be stimulated by several Gs-coupled receptors, but the precise mechanism of action has not yet been elucidated.

By virtue of their linkage to the superfamily of seven-transmembrane receptors, the heterotrimeric G proteins are critical players in the regulation of cellular functions ranging from cell proliferation to differentiation. There is increasing evidence to suggest that malfunctions in G protein signaling may be associated with various disease states such as bacterial infections (Vibrio cholera and Bordetella pertussis), pseudohypoparathyroidism, McCune-Albright syndrome, cancers, and night blindness (1Spiegel A.M.

Attempts to elucidate the mechanisms by which G proteins transduce proliferative signals have revealed many new conduits for G protein signaling. These new pathways provide linkages to oncogenes, kinases, and transcription factors. It has now become apparent that many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors; AC, adenylyl cyclase; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; CaMKII, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; CCh, carbachol; CTX, cholera toxin; DN, dominant negative; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Fsk, forskolin; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HEL, human erythroleukemia; HEK, human embryonic kidney; hIP, human prostacyclin receptor; JAK, Janus kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; JNKK-CA, c-Jun N-terminal kinase kinase constitutive active mutant; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PLCβ, phospholipase Cβ; PKA, protein kinase A; PTX, pertussis toxin; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RNAi, RNA interference; PKC, protein kinase C. can modulate the activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), thereby allowing them to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (9Crespo P. Gutkind J.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 250: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of MAPKs by G proteins proceeds via complex signaling networks involving oncogenes such as Src tyrosine kinases (10Kraus S. Benard O. Naor Z. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32618-32630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and the monomeric GTPases Ras and Rac1 (11Stahle M. Veit C. Bachfischer U. Schierling K.

Transcription factors such as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) have also been shown to participate in the transduction of G protein-mediated proliferative signals (7Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). STATs are key players in mitogenesis because all seven members of STATs are associated with major types of cancer (13Calo V. Migliavacca M. Bazan V. Macaluso M. Buscemi M. Gebbia N. Russo A. J. Cell Physiol. 2003; 197: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Although STATs are typically stimulated by cytokines or growth factor receptors via Janus kinases (JAKs) (14Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar), at least 20 GPCRs have now been shown to possess the ability to activate STATs in a variety of cell types (15Buggy J.J.

J. 2000; 351: 257-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). STAT3 is one of the most widely studied STAT proteins, and its activation apparently involves multiple pathways. Both viral Src (v-Src) and cellular Src (c-Src) tyrosine kinases can activate STAT3 in mammalian fibroblasts (21Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 22Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, MAPKs can phosphorylate Ser727 on STAT3 to modulate its transcriptional activity (23Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), whereas activation of p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is thought to be required for v-Src activation of STAT3 (24Turkson J. Bowman T. Adnane J. Zhang Y. Djeu J.Y. Sekharam M. Frank D.A. Holzman L.B. Wu J. Sebti S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7519-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These and other signaling molecules have been similarly implicated in the activation of STAT3 by G proteins. Neoplastic transformation of NIH-3T3 cells by constitutively active Gαo is mediated via STAT3 in an Src-dependent manner (7Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), although expression of a dominant negative mutant of Gαi2 in the same cell type inhibits Src kinase activity and Tyr705 phosphorylation of STAT3 (25Corre I. Baumann H. Hermouet S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6335-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Gαq family members, Gα14 and Gα16, also employ c-Src for the activation of STAT3 (26Lo R.K. Cheung H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52154-52165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Lo R.K. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Unlike Gαo/i2-mediated stimulatory signals, Gα14/16 additionally requires the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PLCβ/PKC/CaMKII pathways for STAT3 activation. Among the GPCRs that are known to be capable of activating STAT3, most are linked to either Gi/o or Gq, with only a handful coupled to Gs. Although activation of the Gs-coupled human thyrotropin receptor and the prostacyclin receptor (hIP) can lead to STAT3 phosphorylation in FRTL-5 (28Park Y.J. Park E.S. Kim M.S. Kim T.Y. Lee H.S. Lee S. Jang I.S. Shong M. Park D.J. Cho B.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 194: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and human erythroleukemia (HEL) (29Lo R.K. Wise H. Wong Y.H. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) cells, respectively, both receptors also possess the ability to signal via Gq proteins (29Lo R.K. Wise H. Wong Y.H. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Van Sande J. Spicher K. Schultz G. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13733-13735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises a concern as to whether the Gs protein can truly activate the STAT3 pathway because Gq proteins such as G14 and G16 are known activators of STAT3 (26Lo R.K. Cheung H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52154-52165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Lo R.K. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In FRTL-5 cells, elevation of intracellular cAMP activates STAT3, but inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) does not affect thyrotropin receptor-mediated STAT3 activation (28Park Y.J. Park E.S. Kim M.S. Kim T.Y. Lee H.S. Lee S. Jang I.S. Shong M. Park D.J. Cho B.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 194: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, cytokine-triggered STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation and DNA binding are inhibited by cAMP in human mononuclear cells (31Sengupta T.K. Schmitt E.M. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9499-9504Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in cultured cardiomyocytes can be markedly enhanced by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor amrinone, indicating that cAMP is critically involved in β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)-mediated STAT3 activation (32Yin F. Li P. Zheng M. Chen L. Xu Q. Chen K. Wang Y.Y. Zhang Y.Y. Han C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21070-21075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, this Gs-induced cAMP signal may facilitate JAK/STAT3 signaling indirectly through the induction of cytokine expression such as interleukin-6 (33Han C. Demetris A.J. Stolz D.B. Xu L. Lim K. Wu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24831-24846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Liu X.H. Kirschenbaum A. Lu M. Yao S. Klausner A. Preston C. Holland J.F. Levine A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The issue of whether Gs can indeed directly stimulate STAT3 activity remains controversial. We have recently demonstrated that the Gs/Gq-coupled hIP is capable of activating STAT3 in HEL cells, and the signal propagation appears to require JNK (29Lo R.K. Wise H. Wong Y.H. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because G16-mediated activation of STAT3 in HEL cells, as well as in HEK 293 cells, is independent of JNK signaling (26Lo R.K. Cheung H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52154-52165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this difference is because of Gs-mediated signaling. In this study, we examined the ability of Gαs to activate STAT3 by expressing the constitutively active GαsQL or stimulating the Gs-coupled β2AR in HEK 293 cells and characterizing the molecular components involved in the signal transduction. Materials—The cDNAs of human G proteins were obtained from Guthrie Research Institute (Sayre, PA). Cell culture reagents, including Lipofectamine PLUS and Lipofectamine 2000 reagents, were obtained from Invitrogen. All kinase inhibitors, their negative analogues, and other cAMP analogues were ordered from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Isoproterenol, salbutamol, carbachol, ICI 118-551, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and cholera toxin (CTX) were purchased from Sigma. Pertussis toxin (PTX) was obtained from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Gαs and Ras-GRF1 antisera were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and other antisera were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Nitrocellulose membrane and ECL kit were ordered from Bio-Rad and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. The Stealth Select RNAi for Gαs and Stealth RNAi negative control were products of Invitrogen, and the RNAi for Ras-GFR1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The luciferase reporter gene, pSTAT3-TA-luc, was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The luciferase substrate and its lysis buffer were purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1573, Manassas, VA) and were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium at 5% CO2, 37 °C with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For Western blotting analysis, HEK 293 cells were seeded on 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well and were cultured in the growth medium for 18–24 h prior to transfection. They were co-transfected with various cDNAs using Lipofectamine PLUS reagents. The transfection mixtures in serum-free Opti-MEM (600 μl/well) contained 3 μl of both PLUS and Lipofectamine reagents and 500 ng of each G protein cDNA. For the experiments with other signaling molecules, 250 ng of each construct was added. 3 h after transfection, 300 μl of Opti-MEM containing 30% FBS was added into the wells. For Gαs knockdown experiments, HEK 293 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well and again cultured in growth medium overnight. They were transfected and maintained in serum-free Opti-MEM containing 80 pmol of Stealth Select RNAi targeting Gαs, RNAi targeting Ras-GRF1, or Stealth RNAi Negative Control Med GC and 5μl Lipofectamine 2000 per well for 24 h. For luciferase assays, HEK 293 cells were seeded into 96-well white microplates designed for luminescent work at 1.5 × 104 cells/well and were cultured in minimum essential medium overnight. Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine PLUS reagents (26Lo R.K. Cheung H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52154-52165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The transfection mixtures in serum-free Opti-MEM (100 μl/well) contained 0.2 μl of both PLUS and Lipofectamine reagents, 10 ng of cDNAs encoding G proteins or the control vector cDNAs, and 100 ng of pSTAT3-TA-luc. For the experiments with extra signaling molecules, 5 ng of each construct cDNA was added. After 3 h, 50 μl of Opti-MEM containing 30% FBS was added into the wells and cultured overnight. Western Blotting Analysis—30 h after transfection, HEK 293 cells were serum-starved overnight. Prior to cell lysis, incubation with different kinase inhibitors for 30 min, if applicable, was performed. An extra 30 min of agonist exposure was performed for receptor-induced STAT3 activations. For Gαs knockdown experiments, transfectants were directly challenged with different ligands for 30 min. Cells were then lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer and then gently shaken on ice for 30 min. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. Clarified lysates were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (35Liu A.M. Wong Y.H. Neurosignals. 2005; 14: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). STAT3, phospho-STAT3-Tyr705, phospho-STAT3-Ser727, and Gαs were detected by specific primary antisera and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera. The immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence with the ECL kit, and the images detected in x-ray films were quantified by densitometric scanning using the Eagle Eye II still video system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Luciferase Assay—Transfectants were grown in culture medium for 30 h and then maintained in serum-free medium. Where indicated, cells were treated with different kinase inhibitors overnight in serum-free medium. Cell lysates were analyzed as described previously (26Lo R.K. Cheung H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52154-52165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Activation of Gαs Induces STAT3 Activations in HEK 293 Cells—We have previously demonstrated that hIP is coupled to both Gs and Gq for signal transduction (36Kam Y. Chow K.B. Wise H. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Chow K.B. Jones R.L. Wise H. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2004; 70: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and Gs may also participate in mediating the hIP-induced STAT3 phosphorylations in HEL cells (29Lo R.K. Wise H. Wong Y.H. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hence, we began our study by determining whether a constitutively active mutant of Gαs (GαsQL) possesses the ability to stimulate STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA1, Gαs, or GαsQL. Total cell lysates prepared from the transfected cells were probed with anti-phospho-STAT3-Tyr705, anti-phospho-STAT3-Ser727, and anti-STAT3 antisera. Expression of either Gαs or GαsQL in HEK 293 cells did not affect the expression of total STAT3 as compared with the vector control (Fig. 1A). Anti-phospho-STAT3-Tyr705 and anti-phospho-STAT3-Ser727 antisera revealed very low levels of basal STAT3 phosphorylation at either Tyr705 or Ser727 sites in the vector control and Gαs-expressing cells. In contrast, expression of GαsQL led to a detectable increase in both Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 1A). Pretreating the transfectants with PKA inhibitors, 10 μm H-89 or 100 μm (Rp)-cAMP, significantly inhibited GαsQL-induced STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations. Examination of the STAT3-driven transcriptional activity was also performed using a luciferase reporter gene assay. In HEK 293 cells transiently co-transfected with pSTAT3-TA-luc, GαsQL significantly induced STAT3 transcriptional activation as compared with the corresponding controls (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of PKA by H-89 or (Rp)-cAMP completely abrogated the GαsQL-induced luciferase activity, indicating that Gαs/cAMP is able to mediate STAT3 phosphorylations and transcriptional activation. To further confirm the specific involvement of Gαs/cAMP in the activation of STAT3, we utilized Gαs-activating CTX, adenylyl cyclase (AC)-stimulating forskolin (Fsk), and cAMP analogues (Bt2cAMP and (Sp)-cAMP; Fig. 1C). Pretreating HEK 293 cells for 4 h with CTX to directly stimulate Gαs by ADP-ribosylation (38Gill D.M. Meren R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) significantly induced both STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations (Fig. 1C). Stimulation of AC by Fsk and the applications of cAMP analogues (Bt2cAMP and (Sp)-cAMP) also increased the STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations, although using (Rp)-cAMP did not induce any significant change in STAT3 phosphorylations. Thus, activation of the Gαs pathway could indeed result in STAT3 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation. GαsQL Induces STAT3 Phosphorylations via MEK1/2, JNK, c-Src, and PI3K in HEK 293 Cells—A number of signaling molecules have been shown to be required for Gα-induced activation of STAT3 (7Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Lo R.K. Cheung H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol.

They include c-Src (for GαoQL, Gα14QL, and Gα16QL), ERK, and PLCβ/PKC/CaMKII (for Gα14QL and Gα16QL). Hence, we asked if GαsQL-mediated STAT3 phosphorylations utilize the same signaling intermediates as other constitutively active Gα subunits. PLCβ/PKC/CaMKII signaling cascade is one of the critical pathways regulating Gα14- and Gα16-mediated STAT3 activations (26Lo R.K. Cheung H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52154-52165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Lo R.K. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because Gαs is unable to modulate the PLCβ cascade, inhibiting PLCβ should have no effect on GαsQL-mediated STAT3 phosphorylations. HEK 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA1, Gαs, or GαsQL and treated with different kinase inhibitors for 30 min (Figs. 1D, 2, 3, and 5). As expected, treatment of GαsQL-transfected cells with U73122 or U73343 (10 μm) did not affect STAT3 phosphorylations (Fig. 1D), suggesting the lack of involvement of PLCβ in GαsQL-mediated STAT3 activation.FIGURE 3c-Src is involved only in GαsQL-induced STAT3 Ser727, but not Tyr705, phosphorylation in HEK 293 cells, whereas JAK2 is capable of regulating phosphorylations at both residues. A, C, and E, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA1, Gαs, or GαsQL. Cells were treated with 25 μm PP1, 25 μm PP2, 25 μm PP3, 100 μm AG490, 100 μg/ml WHI-P131 (WHI), 100 μg/ml WHI-P258 (WHI-ve), or vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) for 30 min. B and D, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA1, Gαs, or GαsQL along with cDNAs of wild type or dominant negative mutant (DN) of c-Src or vector control (pcDNA1). Overexpression of exogenous c-Src was confirmed by an anti-c-Src antiserum (lowest panel). Cell lysates were resolved and analyzed for STAT3, ERK, JNK, and JAK2 phosphorylations as described in Fig. 1A.

B, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA1, Gαs, or GαsQL along with cDNAs of wild type or dominant negative mutant (DN) of PI3K or vector control (pcDNA1).

Cheung H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52154-52165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To study the requirement of ERK in the GαsQL-induced STAT3 phosphorylations, we used 10 μm U0126 to inhibit MEK1/2, the upstream regulators of ERK. Suppression of MEK1/2 activity by U0126 significantly blocked the Ser727, but not the Tyr705, phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 2A). This is in agreement with the differential attenuation of hIP-induced STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation by U0126 in HEL cells (29Lo R.K. Wise H. Wong Y.H. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Apart from ERK, the possible involvement of the other two MAPKs was also examined. Blockade of JNK and p38 MAPK by SP600125 (30 μm) and SB202190 (10 μm), respectively, produced very different results (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of JNK suppressed both Tyr705 and Ser727 STAT3 phosphorylations, whereas p38 MAPK inhibition was unable to alter any GαsQL-induced STAT3 activations. To address the specificity of these kinase inhibitors, we analyzed the MEK/ERK and JNK/c-Jun activations using various antibodies following the treatment of cells with different kinase inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 2B, only the application of U0126 led to the attenuation of ERK phosphorylation, whereas SP600125 and the negative controls (U0124 and SP-ve) were ineffective. Inhibition of JNK by SP600125 suppressed the phosphorylation of c-Jun. The use of U0126, U0124, and SP-ve did not affect the phosphorylations of JNK and c-Jun (Fig. 2B). Further studies on different monomeric GTPases associated with the MAPK cascades were performed by overexpressing their dominant negative mutants (Fig. 2C). The ability of GαsQL to stimulate STAT3 phosphorylations was unaffected by the presence of wild type monomeric GTPases. Consistent with the results obtained with U0126 (Fig. 2A), inhibition of the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway by overexpressing the dominant negative Ras (RasDN) inhibited Ser727 STAT3 phosphorylation but failed to attenuate the Tyr705 STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Along with STAT3, GαsQL-induced ERK phosphorylations were reduced as well, although the reductions were only partial (Fig. 2D)"
https://openalex.org/W2070438439,"Agrin induces the aggregation of postsynaptic proteins at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This activity requires the receptor-tyrosine kinase MuSK. Agrin isoforms differ in short amino acid stretches at two sites, called A and B, that are localized in the two most C-terminal laminin G (LG) domains. Importantly, agrin isoforms greatly differ in their activities of inducing MuSK phosphorylation and of binding to α-dystroglycan. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we characterized the amino acids important for these activities of agrin. We find that the conserved tripeptide asparagineglutamate-isoleucine in the eight-amino acid long insert at the B-site is necessary and sufficient for full MuSK phosphorylation activity. However, even if all eight amino acids were replaced by alanines, this agrin mutant still has significantly higher MuSK phosphorylation activity than the splice version lacking any insert. We also show that binding to α-dystroglycan requires at least two LG domains and that amino acid inserts at the A and the B splice sites negatively affect binding. Agrin induces the aggregation of postsynaptic proteins at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This activity requires the receptor-tyrosine kinase MuSK. Agrin isoforms differ in short amino acid stretches at two sites, called A and B, that are localized in the two most C-terminal laminin G (LG) domains. Importantly, agrin isoforms greatly differ in their activities of inducing MuSK phosphorylation and of binding to α-dystroglycan. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we characterized the amino acids important for these activities of agrin. We find that the conserved tripeptide asparagineglutamate-isoleucine in the eight-amino acid long insert at the B-site is necessary and sufficient for full MuSK phosphorylation activity. However, even if all eight amino acids were replaced by alanines, this agrin mutant still has significantly higher MuSK phosphorylation activity than the splice version lacking any insert. We also show that binding to α-dystroglycan requires at least two LG domains and that amino acid inserts at the A and the B splice sites negatively affect binding. Agrin is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan best known for its function to induce and maintain postsynaptic specializations at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). 3The abbreviations used are: NMJ, neuromuscular junction; AChR, acetylcholine receptors; LG, laminin G; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MuSK, muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase. Agrin was purified from the electric organ of Torpedo californica based on its activity to induce the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on cultured muscle cells (1Nitkin R.M. Smith M.A. Magill C. Fallon J.R. Yao Y.M.M. Wallace B.G. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2471-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This biological function and the fact that agrin-like immunoreactivity is high in motor neurons led to the hypothesis that agrin is the motor neuron-derived factor inducing the formation of postsynaptic structures in vivo (2McMahan U.J. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1990; 55: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Indeed, agrin-deficient mice lack postsynaptic specializations and die at birth of respiratory failure (3Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Moscoso L. Rupp F. Scheller R.H. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 4Lin W. Burgess R.W. Dominguez B. Pfaff S.L. Sanes J.R. Lee K.F. Nature. 2001; 410: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Moreover, agrin alone is sufficient to induce postsynaptic structures in nerve-free regions of adult, fully innervated muscles in vivo (5Jones G. Meier T. Lichtsteiner M. Witzemann V. Sakmann B. Brenner H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2654-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Bezakova G. Helm J.P. Francolini M. Lomo T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These data are strong evidence that agrin is both required and sufficient to generate functional postsynaptic structures in skeletal muscle (for reviews see Refs. 9Ruegg M.A. Bixby J.L. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 22-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar and 10Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also suggests a role of agrin in the formation of the immunological synapse (11Khan A.A. Bose C. Yam L.S. Soloski M.J. Rupp F. Science. 2001; 292: 1681-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and of synapses in the brain (12Hoover C.L. Hilgenberg L.G. Smith M.A. J.

Smith M.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, a miniaturized form of agrin might be of therapeutic relevance for the treatment of a particular form of congenital muscular dystrophy (14Moll J. Barzaghi P. Lin S. Bezakova G. Lochmuller H. Engvall E. Muller U. Ruegg M.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Qiao C. Li J. Zhu T. Draviam R. Watkins S. Ye X. Chen C. Xiao X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11999-12004Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). At least three sites within the agrin gene undergo alternative mRNA splicing resulting in several protein isoforms (see Fig. 1A). Alternative usage of exons at the 5′-end of the gene results in one isoform that binds to the coiled-coil region of laminins via the N-terminal agrin (NtA) domain (17Denzer A.J. Brandenberger R. Gesemann M. Chiquet M. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Mascarenhas J.B. Ruegg M.A. Winzen U. Halfter W. Engel J. Stetefeld J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and an another isoform that allows agrin to be incorporated into plasma membranes as a type II transmembrane protein via a transmembrane (TM) region (20Burgess R.W. Skarnes W.C. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Neumann F.R. Bittcher G. Annies M. Schumacher B. Kroger S. Ruegg M.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The secreted, NtA form of agrin is expressed in non-neuronal cells and motor neurons and is required to immobilize agrin in the synaptic basal lamina at the NMJ, while the TM form is mainly expressed by neurons of the brain (20Burgess R.W. Skarnes W.C. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Neumann F.R. Bittcher G. Annies M. Schumacher B. Kroger S. Ruegg M.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Two additional splice sites are located within laminin G (LG) domains LG2 and LG3. The splice site in LG2, called A in chick and y in rodents, can contain a four-amino acid long insert (A4) that encodes a heparin binding site (22Campanelli J.T. Gayer G.G. Scheller R.H. Development. 1996; 122: 1663-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hopf C. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5231-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This insert is included in agrin transcripts expressed in neurons and glial cells whereas non-neuronal cells in the periphery, such as muscle, Schwann, and kidney cells, lack this insert (25Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 27Stone D.M. Nikolics K. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6767-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second splice site, called B in chick and z in rodents, is encoded by two exons of 24 bp and 33 bp in length. Alternative usage of these exons results in protein isoforms with 0 (B0), 8 (B8), 11 (B11), or 19 (B19) amino acid long inserts. The presence of an insert is essential for AChR aggregation in vitro (25Ruegg M.A. Tsim K.W. Horton S.E. Kröger S. Escher G. Gensch E.M. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The agrin postsynapse-inducing activity is mediated by the muscle-specific receptor-tyrosine kinase MuSK (31DeChiara T.M. Bowen D.C. Valenzuela D.M. Simmons M.V. Poueymirou W.T. Thomas S. Kinetz E. Compton D.L. Rojas E. Park J.S. Smith C. DiStefano P.S. Glass D.J. Burden S.J. Yancopoulos G.D.

However, agrin does not bind to MuSK directly, suggesting that MuSK is the signaling but not the binding component in the agrin receptor complex. Another function that involves the LG domains of agrin is the binding to α-dystroglycan, a peripheral membrane protein that is tightly associated with the transmembranous β-dystroglycan and arises from a common precursor protein by posttranslational cleavage (33Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Binding to α-dystroglycan has also been found in other LG domain-containing proteins such as laminin-α1 and -α2 (33Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 35Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), perlecan (35Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and neurexins (36Sugita S. Saito F. Tang J. Satz J. Campbell K. Sudhof T.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although initially postulated, binding of agrin to α-dystroglycan is not necessary for its AChR-aggregating activity (23Gesemann M. Cavalli V. Denzer A.J. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the binding of agrin to α-dystroglycan is also regulated by alternative mRNA splicing at the A and B sites. For example, a C-terminal fragment that includes the four-amino acid long insert at the A-site and the eight-amino acid long insert at the B-site (agrinA4B8) binds to α-dystroglycan with severalfold lower affinity than the corresponding fragment lacking amino acid inserts (agrinA0B0; Ref. 37Gesemann M. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 600-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, splicing at the A- and B-site is a critical determinant for several functions of agrin. The molecular details that are important for the different functions of agrin are not known but structural insights obtained by x-ray crystallography and solution NMR of the LG3 domain from different agrin splice variants (38Stetefeld J. Alexandrescu A.T. Maciejewski M.W. Jenny M. Rathgeb-Szabo K. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Frank S. Ruegg M.A. Kammerer R.A. Structure (Camb). 2004; 12: 503-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have led to the following conclusions: 1) the overall fold of the agrin-LG3 domain is very similar to that of LG domains of other proteins (39Rudenko G. Nguyen T. Chelliah Y. Sudhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 1999; 99: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 42Sasaki T. Knyazev P.G. Cheburkin Y. Gohring W. Tisi D. Ullrich A. Timpl R. Hohenester E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44164-44170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); 2) the amino acid insert at the B-site is highly flexible indicative of an “induced-fit” mechanism of docking to its putative receptor; 3) the structure of different splice forms of the LG3 domain diverge already seven amino acids before and six amino acids after the B-site; and 4) depletion of Ca2+ from LG3B8 induces structural changes at the same amino acid residues where the different protein isoforms diverge. Ca2+ depletion also induces a high flexibility in LG3B0 and the most dynamic residues are those whose orientations differ between LG3B0 and LG3B8. These studies thus led us to speculate that amino acids involved in the agrin AChR-aggregating function might not only be found within the B-splice insert but also outside. We now used site-directed mutagenesis of conspicuous amino acids to identify those involved in MuSK phosphorylation. We find that an agrin mutant where all amino acids of the eight-amino acid insert at the B-site were replaced by alanines is still active. We also find that the most critical site in the B insert is the tripeptide Asn-Glu-Ile with the strongest contribution of Asn and Ile. Curiously, mutation of a single amino acid does not alter the potency at all, although a construct in which Asn1779, the residue at which the structure of agrin splice variants deviate from each other is mutated to Ala, has an increased potency for MuSK phosphorylation. Finally, we find that the length of the amino acid inserts at the A- and the B-site but not their sequence affects agrin binding to α-dystroglycan. Thus, our data support our previous hypothesis that amino acids outside of the splice sites contribute to the agrin activity. Antibodies—Polyclonal antiserum 194T was raised against a His-tagged version of the extracellular domain of MuSK (MuSK-ECD) that had been purified from supernatants of transfected HEK293 EBNA cells. For the first injection ∼60 μg of protein in complete Freund's adjuvant was used. Specificity of anti-MuSK-ECD IgG was determined by Western blot analysis using MuSK-transfected HEK293 cells and by staining cross-sections of mouse soleus muscle (see supplementary Fig. S1). Cell Culture and Transfections—C2C12 myotubes were prepared as previously described (29Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). HEK293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA), 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected in serum-free conditions with the agrin expression constructs using the JetPei transfection reagent according to the supplier's description (QBiogene). After 2-7 days, the conditioned medium was collected and the concentration of the recombinant agrin protein was determined as described below. Additionally, the proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis (see supplementary Fig. S2). AChR Aggregation Assay—C2C12 myoblasts were seeded on gelatin-coated, 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) and differentiation into myotubes was induced by changing the proliferation medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 4-6 days, myotubes were incubated with recombinant agrin proteins for ∼16 h at 37 °C. After washing, cells were incubated in the same medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml rhodamine-labeled-α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) for 45-60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 10 min in 2% PFA. Fixed cells were mounted on glass coverslips with Cityfluor (Plano) and examined with a microscope equipped with epifluorescence (Leica). Expression Constructs—The constructs pc95A4B8, pc95A0B0, pc95A4B11 (29Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and phumanγ1 (43Traunecker A. Oliveri F. Karjalainen K. Trends Biotechnol. 1991; 9: 109-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were used as PCR templates to generate the cDNA construct encoding C45A4/0B0/8/11, LG3B0/8, and LG2A0/4 fused to a humanγ1-Fc tag. Primers used to amplify the fragments for C45A4B8 and C45A0B0 were s4655_NheI CGA AGC TCA GTG AGC AGG ACC ACA CCA TG and as6227_BamHI CAC GAG GAT CCC TTT GGC TGA TCA GTG TAA TA and primers used for the amplification of the humanγ1-Fc-tag were shγ1_BamHI TGA GGA TCC TAG AGC CCA AAT CTT CTG AC and ashγ1_XhoI GCT GAC TCG AGT CAT TTA CCC GGA GAC AGG GAG AG. The PCR products were cloned in-frame to the BM-40 signal peptide (44Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) into the expression vector pCEP-Pu cut with XhoI and NheI. The C45A4B0 construct was generated by digesting C45A4B8 with HindIII/XhoI and ligating the fragment containing the A4-insert into C45A0B0 opened with HindIII/XhoI. Similarly, C45A0B8 was generated by digesting C45A0B0 with BamHI/XhoI and ligating the fragment containing the B0-insert into C45A4B8 opened with BamHI/XhoI. The LG2A0/4 and LG3B0/8 were generated using C45A4B8 and C45A0B0 as PCR template. Primers used to amplify the LG2A0/4 were s4655_NheI, CGA AGC TCA GTG AGC AGG ACC ACA CCA TG and as_cAgrin-BamHI_G2 CAC CAG GAT CCC GAA AGT GGA GAT TTC AAC GG. Primers used for LG3B0/8 were s_G3_NheI ATA GCT AGC TGA GAA AGT GAT CAT TGA GAA GGC AGC TGG, and as_cAgrin_BamHI_G3 CAC GAG GAT CCC TTT GGC TGA GC. The PCR products were digested with NheI and BamHI and ligated into C45A4B8 cut with NheI/BamHI. Sequencing was used to assure that all constructs were correct. Mutant proteins were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of C45A4B8 that was cloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). Mutations were introduced by forward and reverse primers with overlapping 5′-ends that encoded sequences on either side of the mutation (primer sequences are available on request). PCR was on the whole plasmid with long expand polymerase kit (Roche Applied Science). Template DNA was removed by DpnI digestion and the new plasmid containing the mutation was transformed into DH10B. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Mutated constructs were subcloned into pCEP-Pu containing the BM-40 signal sequence and humanγ1-Fc tag by BamHI/EcoRI digestion. Quantification of Agrin—To determine the concentration of recombinant agrin, 100 μl of goat anti-humanγ1 IgG (5 μg/ml, BIOSOURCE) in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) was immobilized on a 96-well high binding microtiter plate (Costar) overnight at 4 °C. Agrin-containing media or purified agrin was incubated for 1 h followed by 3 washes with PBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20) and incubation of an HRP-conjugated goat anti-human γ1 IgG antibody (70 ng/ml; BIOSOURCE) for 3 h at room temperature. After four washes with PBST, the amount of agrin was measured by using McEvans solution, ABTS and H2O2 as an HRP substrate. Absorbance was measured on an ELISA-reader at 405 nm at several time points. As a standard, affinity-purified C45A4B8 at the concentration range between 0.1 and 100 ng/ml was used. Solid Phase MuSK Phosphorylation Assay—C2C12 myotubes were grown in gelatin-coated 96-well plates (Falcon). Agrin stimulations were routinely done for 30 min with protein diluted in 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 1.34 mm Na2HPO4, 5.6 mm glucose, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Myotubes were subsequently rinsed and extracted in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, phosphatase, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min at 4 °C. The extracted proteins were transferred to a 96-well high binding microtiter plate (Costar) that had previously been coated with 100 μl of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (1 μg/ml, Upstate) in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 and had been blocked with PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 and 0.5% Top Block (Juro). Extracts of C2C12 myotubes were incubated in the microtiter plates for 5 h at 4 °C. Plates were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) followed by an overnight incubation of protein A-purified anti-MuSK IgG (194T; dilution 1:5,000) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% Top Block (incubation buffer). Plates were rinsed 4 times with PBST and incubated for 4 h at 4°C with 100 μl of an HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (0.2 μg/ml; Jackson Immunoresearch). Subsequently, the plate was washed with PBST four times and once with PBS. For detection, QuantaBlue (Pierce) was mixed according to the manufacturer's advice, and 100 μl of the solution was added to each well. The reaction was stopped after 30 min by QuantaBlue stop solution. Fluorescence was measured on an ELISA reader (Gemini) with the excitation wavelength of 325 nm and detection at 420 nm. Purification of α-Dystroglycan—Purification was essentially done as described elsewhere (45Brancaccio A. Schulthess T. Gesemann M. Engel J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 g of frozen chicken breast were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 0.2 m NaCl (buffer A). After centrifugation (12,000 × g), the supernatant was filtered through a Whatman filter paper. The cleared solution was incubated at 4 °C with 10 ml of DEAESephacel beads (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated in buffer A. After extensive washes with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted from the beads by 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 0.5 m NaCl (buffer B). Eluates were then incubated with 5 ml of WGA-Sepharose previously equilibrated in buffer B. After washing the resin 5 times with buffer B, elution from WGASepharose was achieved by adding 300 mm N-acetyglucosamine. Eluted proteins were then dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The enrichment of α-dystroglycan was verified by transfer overlay assay as described below. Solid Phase α-Dystroglycan Binding Assay—Enzyme-linked binding assays were performed with 100 μlof α-dystroglycan (5 μg/ml) in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6, immobilized on a 96-well high binding microtiter plate by absorption overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and 3% BSA (blocking buffer), wells were incubated with agrin proteins diluted in blocking buffer. Wells were then washed with blocking buffer and incubated with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-human γ1 IgG (70 ng/ml in blocking buffer). The amount of HRP was measured using McEvans solution and ABTS/H2O2 as substrate. Absorbance was measured on an ELISA reader at 405 nm. To avoid saturation of the signal, measurements were performed every 5 min. Transfer Overlay Binding Assay—Purified chicken skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan was denatured with reducing SDS sample buffer, separated on a 3-12% SDS-PAGE (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and transferred to nitrocellulose (47Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked for 2 h with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and 5% milk powder (blocking buffer). The membrane was cut into strips and incubated overnight at 4 °C with agrin diluted in blocking buffer. Nitrocellulose strips were washed three times with blocking buffer and subsequently incubated for 2 h with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-human γ1 IgG (1 μg/ml). Finally, the membrane strips were washed three times with blocking buffer and once with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by the ECL detection method (Pierce). Curve Fitting—Data were fitted using a single class of equivalent binding sites according to Equation 1, Ai=Asat×[c/(Kd+c)+A0](Eq. 1) where Ai represents the absorbance measured at a particular concentration of the ligand, Kd the dissociation constant, c the concentration of the ligand, and Asat and A0 are the absorbances at saturation and in the absence of ligand, respectively. Data were normalized according the equation (Ai - A0)/(Asat - A0). The software used was Prism GraphPad 4.0. Modeling—The splice insert model was built based on the solution NMR structure of LG3B0 (PDB code: 1Q56) together with both calcium containing x-ray structures of LG3B8 (PDB code: 1PZ8) and LG3B11 (PDB code: 1PZ9). Residues missing in the splice insert were included manually. The lowest energy structure was subject to 200 cycles of unrestrained Powell minimization using CNS (48Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Harmonic restraints were imposed on the protein atoms (3 kcal/mol Å2) with increased weight (20 kcal/mol Å2). The model of the LG2 domain and the EGF domain were generated using SWISS-MODEL. The tandem structure of LG2-EGF-LG3 was created on the basis of typical elbow angle described for Fv-fragments. To avoid sterical clashes between LG2-EGF and EGF-LG3, the same refinement protocol as described above was performed. Constructs and Cellular Assays—To facilitate purification of the recombinant protein from the medium of transfected HEK293 EBNA cells and to increase apparent binding affinities, all agrin fragments were expressed as fusion constructs with the Fc part of human γ1 (Fig. 1B). The first set of agrin mutants was derived from a construct encoding a 45-kDa, C-terminal fragment (called C45A0/4B0/8/11) that comprises LG2 and LG3 and one EGF-like (EG) domain. This fragment is known to be the smallest one that induces AChR aggregation with a half-maximal response (EC50) at picomolar concentration (29Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To test the influence of individual splice inserts independent of the second site, we also generated constructs encoding only LG2 or LG3 (Fig. 1B). For competition experiments, we further used a miniaturized form of agrinA0B0 (N25C95A0B0 or mini-agrin; 14). We mutated amino acid residues that were identical between fish and mammals (bold in Fig. 1C). Because agrin-induced AChR aggregation requires MuSK phosphorylation, we first established a two-side enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that allowed us to determine reliable dose-response curves for the different constructs. The assay (Fig. 1D) is based on the use of the monoclonal antibody 4G10 (49Cohen B. Yoakim M. Piwnica-Worms H. Roberts T.M. Schaffhausen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4458-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and an anti-MuSK antiserum that recognizes MuSK in immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis (supplementary Fig. S1). The ELISA detects MuSK phosphorylation in cultured C2C12 myotubes after stimulation by 2 nm neural agrin (Fig. 1E; MT + agrin). A nonspecific signal was detected in non-treated myotubes (MT) or myoblasts incubated with 2 nm neural agrin (MB + agrin). This signal persisted even when no cell extract was added (w/o cells). The background signal was, however, lost upon omitting the anti-MuSK IgG (w/o 1 Ab) or the coating of the plates with 4G10 (w/o coating). Similarly, when preimmune serum was used instead of the anti-MuSK antiserum, the high background signal became lower (data not shown). This indicates that this relatively high background originates from tyrosine-phosphorylated IgG in the primary antiserum. As the background was very stable and agrin-induced MuSK phosphorylation resulted in a consistent, significantly higher signal, the assay was still sensitive and reproducible enough to measure phosphorylation of MuSK in cultured C2C12 myotubes. Contribution of Amino Acids within the B-site to Agrin-induced MuSK Phosphorylation—To determine the contribution of amino acids within the B-inserts to the agrin MuSK phosphorylation activity, we compared the potency of agrin splice variants in the MuSK phosphorylation assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, the EC50 value was lowest with C45A4B8 followed by C45A4B11. No activity was detected with C45A4B0 and C45A0B0. Thus, MuSK phosphorylation activity of agrin splice variants follows the same order as their AChR aggregation (29Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Whereas even 100 nm of C45A4B0 did not induce any MuSK phosphorylation, the same concentration induced some AChR clusters (Ref. 29Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar; see also supplementary Fig. S2). To get insights into the molecular details of agrin-induced MuSK phosphorylation, we next made a series of mutants where conserved amino acids of the B8 insert were altered to alanine (Fig. 2B). First, we replaced all eight amino acids by alanines (mutant C45B8-8A). As shown in Fig. 2C, the potency and efficacy of C45B8-8A was much lower than that of wild-type C45A4B8. In strong contrast to C45A4B0, however, C45B8-8A still induced MuSK p"

Although the role of PtdIns[4,5]P2 in endocytosis is well established, the precise trafficking steps relying on normal PtdIns[4,5]P2 balance in the endosomal pathway have not yet been elucidated. Here we show that decrease in intracellular PtdIns[4,5]P2 levels achieved by the overexpression of the 5-phosphatase domain of synaptojanin 1 or by siRNA knock-down of PIP5Ks expression lead to severe defects in the internalization of transferrin as well as in the recycling of internalized transferrin back to the cell surface in COS-7 cells. These defects suggest that PtdIns[4,5]P2 participates in multiple trafficking and/or sorting events during endocytosis. Coexpression of the PtdIns[4,5]P2 synthesizing enzyme, PIP5KI gamma, was able to rescue these endocytic defects. Furthermore, decreased levels of PtdIns[4,5]P2 caused delays in rapid and slow membrane recycling pathways as well as a severe backup of endocytosed membrane. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PtdIns[4,5]P2 availability regulates multiple steps in the endocytic cycle in non-neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2119637652,"RPE65 is the retinal isomerase essential for conversion of all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol in the visual cycle. Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), an autosomal recessive form of RP resulting in blindness, is commonly caused by mutations in the Rpe65 gene. Whereas the molecular mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to retinal disease remain largely unresolved, affected patients show marked RPE damage and photoreceptor degeneration. We evaluated gene expression in Rpe65-/- mouse model of LCA before and at the onset of photoreceptor cell death in 2, 4, and 6 month old animals. Microarray analysis demonstrates altered expression of genes involved in phototransduction, apoptosis regulation, cytoskeleton organization, and extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents. Cone-specific phototransduction genes are strongly decreased, reflecting early loss of cones. In addition, remaining rods show modified expression of genes encoding components of the cytoskeleton and ECM. This may affect rod physiology and interaction with the adjacent RPE and lead to loss of survival signals, as reflected by the alteration of apoptosis-related genes Together, these results suggest that RPE65 defect triggers an overall remodeling of the neurosensitive retina that may, in turn, disrupt photoreceptor homeostasis and induce apoptosis signaling cascade toward retinal cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2158753304,"The 5′-leader of tobacco etch virus (TEV) genomic RNA directs the efficient translation from the naturally uncapped viral RNA. The TEV 143-nt 5′-leader folds into a structure that contains two domains, each of which contains RNA pseudoknots. The 5′-proximal pseudoknot 1 (PK1) is necessary to promote cap-independent translation (Zeenko, V., and Gallie, D. R. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 26813–26824). During the translation initiation of cellular mRNAs, eIF4G functions as an adapter that recruits many of the factors involved in stimulating 40 S ribosomal subunit binding to an mRNA. Two related but highly distinct eIF4G proteins are expressed in plants, animals, and yeast. The two plant eIF4G isoforms, referred to as eIF4G and eIFiso4G, differ in size (165 and 86 kDa, respectively) and their functional differences are still unclear. Although eIF4G is required for the translation of TEV mRNA, it is not known if eIF4G binds directly to the TEV RNA itself or if other factors are required. To determine whether binding affinity and isoform preference correlates with translational efficiency, fluorescence spectroscopy was used to measure the binding of eIF4G, eIFiso4G, and their complexes (eIF4F and eIFiso4F, respectively) to the TEV 143-nt 5′-leader (TEV1–143) and a shorter RNA that contained PK1. A mutant (i.e. S1–3) in which the stem of PK1 was disrupted resulting in impaired cap-independent translation, was also tested. These studies demonstrate that eIF4G binds TEV1–143 and PK1 RNA with ∼22–30-fold stronger affinity than eIFiso4G. eIF4G and eIF4F bind TEV1–143 with similar affinity, whereas eIFiso4F binds with ∼6-fold higher affinity than eIFiso4G. The binding affinity of eIF4G, eIF4F, and eIFiso4G to S1–3 was reduced by 3–5-fold, consistent with the reduction in the ability of this mutant to promote cap-independent translation. Temperature-dependent binding studies revealed that binding of the TEV 5′-leader to these initiation factors has a large entropic contribution. Overall, these results demonstrate the first direct interaction of eIF4G with the TEV 5′-leader in the absence of other initiation factors.

The participation of numerous proteins is required for the formation of an 80 S initiation complex at the correct AUG initiation codon. eIF4G interacts with eIF4A to facilitate helicase unwinding activity that removes mRNA secondary structure and promotes ribosome scanning to the initiation codon. eIF3 facilitates ribosome binding to an mRNA and also interacts with eIF4G. eIF4G associates with the poly(A)-binding protein, which enhances cap binding and stabilizes RNA. Accordingly, eIF4G acts as an adaptor protein that recruits other initiation factors involved in stimulating 40 S ribosome binding to mRNA. Functional domains of mammalian eIF4G have been identified. The N-terminal domain is responsible for binding eIF4E and poly(A)-binding protein, the central domain interacts with eIF3 and eIF4A, and the C-terminal domain binds a second molecule of eIF4A and Mnk1, the protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating eIF4E (1Merrick W.C.

Plants express two related but distinct forms of the cap binding complex designated eIF4F and an isoform, eIFiso4F (5Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each isoform is composed of a small cap binding subunit (eIF4E or eIFiso4E, respectively) and a large subunit (eIF4G or iso4G, respectively). The two isoforms are only 30% identical and differ in size. eIF4G has a molecular mass of 165 kDa, whereas eIFiso4G is 86 kDa (5Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison, mammalian eIF4GI and eIF4GII are 46% identical (7Abramson R.D. Browning K.S. Dever T.E. Lawson T.G. Thach R.E. Ravel J.M. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5462-5467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast eIF4G1 and eIF4G2 are 53% identical (6Lax S.R. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two plant eIF4F isoforms have a number of functional similarities in that eIF4F and eIFiso4F support translation in vitro, facilitate ATP-dependent RNA helicase (RNA unwinding) activity, and function as RNA-dependent ATPases (6Lax S.R.

A. 1985; 82: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, functional differences in these two proteins have begun to be elucidated. eIF4F supported translation of an mRNA containing a structured 5′-leader to a greater extent than did eIFiso4F (10Gallie D.R. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36951-36960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that in vitro translation using the tobacco etch virus (TEV) 5′-leader to direct cap-independent translation preferentially used eIF4G instead of eIFiso4G (11Gallie D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12141-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although a direct interaction between eIF4G and the TEV leader was not demonstrated. Virtually all eukaryotic cellular mRNAs are capped and most are also polyadenylated. These two sites are critical for the recruitment of the protein synthesis machinery (4Gallie D.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 949-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, a number of viral mRNAs are naturally uncapped and have evolved alternative strategies for translation. Animal picornaviruses, such as poliovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), lack a 5′ cap and instead have evolved a long and structured 5′-leader that promotes internal ribosome entry of the 40 S ribosomal subunit (12Pettersson R. Flanegan J. Rose J. Baltimore D. Nature. 1977; 268: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Dougherty W.G. Carrington J.C. Annu. Rev.

Lee Y. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For EMCV, eIF4G binds to the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) directly and facilitates binding of the 40 S subunit through interaction with eIF3 (16Pestova T. Hellen C. Shatsky I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 17Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6870-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In the case of poliovirus, a viral protease cleaves the host eIF4G. The C-terminal fragment of eIF4G is unable to participate in eIF4G-eIF4E complex formation and, as a consequence, cap-dependent translation, but retains the binding sites for the IRES, eIF4A, and eIF3 (18Etchison D. Milburn S.C. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14806-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Svitkin Y.V. Herdy B. Costa-Mattioli M. Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10556-10565Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and therefore is sufficient to support translation of EMCV. Although eIF4G binds the EMCV IRES directly, trans-acting factors are required for eIF4G to bind other IRESs, e.g. that in poliovirus. Recently, the mechanism by which TEV, a plant member of the picornavirus superfamily, initiates cap-independent translation was reported (11Gallie D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12141-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Dobrikova E.Y. Grisham R.N. Kaiser C. Lin J. Gromeier M. J.

The genomic RNA of TEV is polyadenylated and contains an IRES element in the 143-nt 5′-leader sequence that is sufficient to ensure efficient translation of the RNA. The 5′-leader folds into a complex structure composed of two domains, each of which contains RNA pseudoknots. Zeenko and Gallie (23Zeenko V. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26813-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) reported that mutations in the 5′ proximal pseudoknot, i.e. PK1, and an upstream single-stranded sequence that flanks PK1 reduced translation. A nucleotide sequence of loop 3 in PK1 is complementary to a highly conserved region of 18 S rRNA. Mutations in this region disrupted translation, supporting the idea that base pairing of the two conserved regions is important for cap-independent initiation (23Zeenko V. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26813-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although these studies identified the essential structural elements of the TEV IRES required for cap-independent translation and the requirement for eIF4G, they did not examine whether eIF4G binds the TEV IRES directly or if trans-acting factors were required. In this study, we have quantitatively determined the binding affinity of eIF4G and eIFiso4G as well as their complexes (eIF4F and eIFiso4F, respectively) to the TEV 143-nt 5′-leader and a shorter RNA segment that contains only PK1. A mutant that disrupted the stem of PK1 was also tested for binding efficiency. These studies demonstrate that eIF4G binds the TEV leader and the PK1-containing region directly with ∼30-fold higher affinity than eIFiso4G. The effect of adding eIF4E or eIFiso4E as well as the thermodynamic parameters are presented. These data provide direct evidence supporting a correlation between eIF4G binding and translational efficiency. They also demonstrate that eIF4G can bind the TEV leader in the absence of trans-acting factors and they show that the PK1 region of TEV IRES is the likely binding site for eIF4G. To our knowledge, no similar finding has been reported for any other potyvirus. Materials—N-Acetyltryptophanamide (NATA), Tris-HCl, Hepes, KCl, KOH, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, diethylpyrocarbonate, and EDTA were purchased from Sigma. Promega Ribo-MAX™ large scale RNA Production System T7 and Promega RiboMAX™ large scale RNA Production System SP6 were used for in vitro RNA synthesis. Peptone, yeast extract, agar, and NaCl were purchased from Fisher for making LB media and agar plates. The restriction enzymes SalI and NcoI were purchased from New England Biolabs. All other chemicals were of analytical or molecular biology grade. Diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water was used for RNA preparation and all experiments with RNA. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—eIFiso4E and eIFiso4G were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLys using pET3d and were purified as described (24Van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following induction of eIFiso4E, cells were lysed in Buffer B containing 600 mm KCl, centrifuged at high speed to remove the ribosomal fraction followed by dialysis to reduce the KCl concentration to 50 mm. The composition of Buffer B was 20 mm Hepes-KOH, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol at pH 7.6, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 ml of aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The dialyzed sample was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Mono-Q ion exchange column. The expressed eIFiso4E was initially eluted with a 50–400 mm KCl linear gradient and followed by a m7GTP-Sepharose affinity column (GE Healthcare) for further purification. eIFiso4E was eluted from the column with the buffer containing 100 mm GTP and 50 mm KCl. For the purification of recombinant eIFiso4G, a HiTrap SP column (Amersham Biosciences) was used (25Khan M.A. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The protein was eluted with a 50–400 mm KCl linear gradient. The eIFiso4G appeared in the 200–300 mm KCl fractions. Purity was confirmed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All steps were carried out in a cold box at ∼4 °C. Recombinant wheat eIF4F and eIF4G were prepared as described previously (24Van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. Karen Browning (University of Texas, Austin, TX). In Vitro TEV mRNA Synthesis—The pT7-luciferase (luc) reporter constructs, in which the firefly luc-coding region is under the control of the T7 promoter in a pBluescript-derived vector, have been described previously (23Zeenko V. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26813-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The PK1-containing region (nt 28–77) and the mutant S1–3 were introduced into the HindIII and SalI sites within the polylinker and the luc reporter introduced into the SalI and BamHI sites. DNA was linearized with SalI, a site immediately upstream of the luc open reading frame. The TEV1–143 sequence was positioned next to the SP6 promoter of PTL7SN.3 GUS vector. The restriction enzyme NcoI was used for cleavage to give linear DNA with the TEV1–143 sequence. The plasmid was the gift of James Carrington (Oregon State University). The linearized DNA was treated with Proteinase K (100 μg/ml) and 0.5% SDS in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was further purified by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) at pH 8.0 followed by ethanol precipitation. Purity was checked in a 1% agarose gel and the concentration was quantified spectrophotometrically following linearization and brought to 0.5 mg/ml. In vitro transcription of PK1 and S1–3 was carried out using Promega RiboMAX™ large scale RNA Production System T7 and TEV1–143 RNA was synthesized using Promega RiboMAX™ large scale RNA Production System SP6 following the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of RNA was quantified by measuring the optical density at 260 nm using the absorbance at 260 nm of 40 μg/ml RNA as 1. The purity of synthesized RNA was checked by measuring the absorbance ratio, A260/280 nm, in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. This absorbance ratio varied from 1.9 to 2.2 in different RNA preparations. The folded structure of these TEV RNA constructs was determined by Zeenko and Gallie (23Zeenko V. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26813-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structures of the full-length TEV leader, PK1, and the stem mutant S1–3 as described (23Zeenko V. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26813-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 1. Fluorescence Measurements—Steady state fluorescence experiments were performed using a SPEX spectrofluorometer using 10-mm path length quartz cuvettes. Binding experiments were performed using 0.02–0.2 μm eIF4G, eIFiso4G, eIF4F, or eIFiso4F to which increasing amounts of TEV RNA constructs were added. For these experiments at least two independent preparations of initiation factors were used. Data were averages of three or more titrations. Fluorescence emission intensity was measured at 333 nm and excitation was at 280 nm with 4-nm band pass slits for excitation and emission channels. The buffer used in the present study contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl at pH 7.5. The sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C for all experiments unless otherwise stated. The fluorescence intensities obtained were corrected for dilution. Inner filter correction for the TEV RNA ligand was performed using NATA as a fluorescent standard as described (26Rambo R.P. Doudna J.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6486-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The observed fluorescence intensity of 10 μm NATA was monitored at 333 nm exciting at 280 nm for each concentration of TEV RNA. The absorption of each TEV RNA concentration was measured at 280 nm. The fluorescence intensity of NATA was normalized and plotted against the absorption of TEV RNA (shown in Fig. 2A). Normalized NATA data versus RNA concentration were generated by fitting with the first-order exponential decay equation using Microcal Origin software package (version 5.0) from Microcal Software Inc. (Northampton, MA). For each RNA concentration in the titration, the normalized NATA corrections to the observed intensities were incorporated using the following equation,Fcorr=Fobs/Cf where Fcorr and Fobs are the corrected and observed fluorescence intensities, respectively, and Cf is the NATA correction factor. Corrections for inner filter effect were also tested using the following equation (27Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar).Fcorr=Fobsantilog[(Aex+Aem)/2] Fcorr and Fobs are the corrected and observed fluorescence intensities. Aex and Aem are the absorbance of the excitation and emission wavelength, respectively. The quenching of eIFiso4G with PK1 RNA and the inner filter correction is shown in Fig. 2B. The absorbance of the samples were measured using an Ultrospec 1100 Pro UV-visible absorption spectrophotometer. The dissociation constants (Kd) of TEV RNA binding to the eIF4G and eIF4G isoforms with their eIF4F complexes were determined by nonlinear curve fitting analysis as described previously (28Ray S. Chakrabarti A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A double-reciprocal plot was used for the determination of ΔFmax and also the association binding constant (KA) using Equation 3.1/ΔF=1/ΔFmax+1/[KA⋅ΔFmax(CL−C0)](Eq. 3) CL is the concentration of the RNA and C0 is the initial concentration of protein. ΔFmax is the fluorescence change for complete saturation of protein with ligand. The linear double-reciprocal plot of 1/ΔF against 1/(CL – C0) is extrapolated to the ordinate to obtain the value of ΔFmax from the intercept (28Ray S. Chakrabarti A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The double-reciprocal plot of eIFiso4G with PK1 RNA is shown in the inset of Fig. 2B. The approach is based on the assumption that the emission intensity is proportional to the concentration of the ligand and CL ≫ C0, i.e. when RNA concentration was in large excess compared with the protein concentration. Evaluation of Thermodynamic Parameters—Thermodynamic parameters, ΔH (van't Hoff enthalpy), ΔS (entropy), and ΔG (free energy), were determined using the following equations (29Gottesfeld J.M. Belitsky J.M. Melander C. Dervan P.B. Luger K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).lnKa=−ΔH/RT+ΔS/RΔG=−RTlnKa(Eq. 5) R and T are the universal gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively. Ka was determined at three different temperatures 5, 15, and 25 °C, respectively. ΔH and ΔS were determined from the slope and intercept of a plot of ln (Ka) against 1/T. ΔG was determined from Equation 5. Fluorescence of the eIFiso4G, eIF4G, eIF4F and eIFiso4F-TEV1–143, PK1, and S1–3 RNA Complexes—Upon complex formation with RNA there was a decrease in the protein fluorescence emission intensities. Because of the high absorbance of the RNA (see “Experimental Procedures”), corrections for the inner filter effect were necessary. The fluorescence quenching of eIFiso4G with PK1 RNA is shown in Fig. 2. The correction for the inner filter effect using absorbance and the correction using NATA, a fluorescent analog that does not bind RNA, are shown (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that inner filter effects corrected by the two methods give nearly identical results. Corrected quenching data were used to obtain binding equilibrium constants. The PK1 within the TEV Leader Binds with Stronger Affinity to eIF4G than to eIFiso4G—eIF4G promotes cap-independent translation conferred by the TEV leader to a greater extent than does eIFiso4G (11Gallie D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12141-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Zeenko and Gallie (23Zeenko V. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26813-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the PK1 within the TEV leader was required for cap-independent translation. PK1 is an H type pseudoknot with two stems, S1 (6 bp) and S2 (5 bp), which are connected by loops L1, L2, and L3. S1 contains a base bulge (C56) (Fig. 1). The two stems are separated by 2 nt of L2. To allow stacking these nucleotides would need to bulge out of the helix or alternatively would produce a bend in the pseudoknot that would also prevent stacking. PK1 is flanked by an unstructured 5′-proximal 37-nt sequence. To correlate the requirement for eIF4G in cap-independent translation with its binding to PK1, we examined the binding efficiency of PK1 with 20 nm eIF4G and 200 nm eIFiso4G. These concentrations of protein were chosen from preliminary studies so that the concentration of protein was less than KD. The binding plots are shown in Fig. 3. The dissociation constants (Kd) for eIF4G and eIFiso4G were 0.126 ± 0.01 and 3.85 ± 0.7 μm, respectively, using PK1 RNA. eIF4G bound PK1 with ∼30-fold higher affinity than eIFiso4G (see Table 1). These data provide quantitative information to support the preferred binding of eIF4G to PK1.TABLE 1Dissociation constants (Kd) for the interactions of eukaryotic initiation factors with TEV1–143, PK1, and mutant S1–3ProteinsKdTEV1-143PK1S1-3μmeIFiso4G2.25 ± 0.333.85 ± 0.7>20eIF4G0.10 ± 0.010.126 ± 0.010.586 ± 0.04eIFiso4F0.178 ± 0.030.685 ± 0.062.03 ± 0.21eIF4F0.079 ± 0.010.194 ± 0.010.502 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab Binding of PK1 RNA with eIF4F and eIFiso4F—The wheat germ initiation factor eIF4F is a complex of eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, and eIF4G. Similarly, eIFiso4F is a complex of the cap-binding protein eIFiso4E and eIFiso4G. eIF4F and eIFiso4F are stable complexes in plants and therefore are isolated as distinct complexes when purified from wheat germ. The concentrations of eIF4F and eIFiso4F also play a critical role in cap-independent translation. To examine the binding affinity of PK1 RNA with eIF4F and eIFiso4F, 20 nm wheat germ eIF4F or 200 nm eIFiso4F were titrated with PK1 RNA. The binding plots are shown in Fig. 4. eIF4F bound PK1 with ∼3.5-fold greater affinity than eIFiso4F (Table 1). The presence of the cap-binding protein, eIF4E, had little effect on eIF4G binding affinity. eIFiso4E, however, increased the affinity of eIFiso4G when present as part of the eIFiso4F complex; eIFiso4F bound to PK1 ∼6-fold more strongly than did eIFiso4G (Fig. 5A), whereas the binding of eIF4F and eIF4G were very similar (Table 1 and Fig. 5B). The presence of the cap-binding proteins reduced the discrimination between the two eIF4F isoforms by almost 9-fold.FIGURE 5Binding analysis of eIFiso4G, eIFiso4F, eIF4G, and eIF4F to PK1 RNA.

The dissociation constant, Kd, for eIFiso4G and eIF4G was 2.25 ± 0.33 and 0.10 ± 0.01 μm, respectively. eIF4G bound TEV1–143 with greater than 20-fold higher affinity than did eIFiso4G. These results are similar to the difference in affinity following binding to PK1 alone where the difference was ∼30-fold. The smaller difference in affinity between the two proteins is due to increased binding of eIFiso4G to TEV1–143, whereas the binding of eIF4G to TEV1–143 and PK1 is the same within experimental error. The binding affinity of eIFiso4G to TEV1–143 is more difficult to measure because of the large inner filter effect. Consequently, although our data reflect averages of at least three titrations and the error spans the range of values obtained from fitting, these data are less accurate than those for binding RNA with higher binding affinity. The binding affinity of eIFiso4F and eIF4F to TEV1–143 showed the same pattern as observed for PK1 with binding constants of 0.178 ± 0.03 and 0.079 ± 0.01 μm, respectively. eIF4F binds the TEV1–143 2.3 times more tightly than does eIFiso4F. For PK1, the difference in binding affinity between the two proteins was 3.5-fold. In this case, both proteins show higher binding affinity for TEV1–143, with the larger effect attributable to eIFiso4F. Fig. 6, A and B, show the binding of eIFiso4F and eIF4F with TEV1–143, PK1, and S1–3, the stem mutant of PK1 discussed below.

https://openalex.org/W1533767372,"The 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master sensor for cellular metabolic energy state. It is activated by a high AMP/ATP ratio and leads to metabolic changes that conserve energy and utilize alternative cellular fuel sources. The kinase is composed of a heterotrimeric protein complex containing a catalytic α-subunit, an AMP-binding γ-subunit, and a scaffolding β-subunit thought to bind directly both the α- and γ-subunits. Here, we use coimmunoprecipitation of proteins in transiently transfected cells to show that the α2-subunit binds directly not only to the β-subunit, confirming previous work, but also to the γ1-subunit. Deletion analysis of the α2-subunit reveals that the C-terminal 386-552 residues are sufficient to bind to the β-subunit. The γ1-subunit binds directly to the α2-subunit at two interaction sites, one within the catalytic domain consisting of α2 amino acids 1-312 and a second within residues 386-552. Binding of the α2 and the γ1-subunits was not affected by 400 μm AMP or ATP. Furthermore, we show that the β-subunit C terminus is essential for binding to the α2-subunit but, in contrast to previous work, the β-subunit does not bind directly to the γ1-subunit. Taken together, this study presents a new model for AMPK heterotrimer structure where through its C terminus the β-subunit binds to the α-subunit that, in turn, binds to the γ-subunit. There is no direct interaction between the β- and γ-subunits."

ASIC3 mRNA has been detected in the homogenate of pulmonary tissues. However, whether ASIC3 is expressed in the apical membranes of lung epithelial cells and whether it regulates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function are not known at the present time. Using reverse transcription-PCR, we found that the ASIC3 mRNA was expressed in the human airway mucosal gland (Calu-3) and human airway epithelial (16HBE14o) cells. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that ASIC3 was co-segregated with CFTR in the apical membranes of Calu-3 cells. Proton-gated, amiloride-sensitive short circuit Na+ currents were recorded across Calu-3 monolayers mounted in an Ussing chamber. In whole-cell patch clamp studies, activation of CFTR channels with cAMP reduced proton-gated Na+ current in Calu-3 cells from -154 ± 28 to -33 ± 16 pA (n = 5, p < 0.05) at -100 mV. On the other hand, cAMP-activated CFTR activity was significantly inhibited following constitutive activation of putative ASIC3 at pH 6.0. Immunoassays showed that both ASIC3 and CFTR proteins were expressed and co-immunoprecipitated mutually in Calu-3 cells.

In contrast to the extensive studies of the ENaC channels and their interactions with CFTR in the last three decades, little is known about the contribution of other apical cation channels of normal and CF epithelia on CFTR function. A new branch of the ENaC/degenerin family, the proton-gated Na+ channels (ASIC1a, -1b, -2a, -2b, -3, and -4), has been cloned from neural tissue (20Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E.

To test the hypothesis that ASIC3 mRNA and proteins are expressed in the apical membrane of pulmonary epithelial cells and contribute to elevated Na+ channel activity in CF epithelia, we studied the expression of ASIC3 channels and possible interaction with CFTR in Calu-3 cells. Our results confirm that ASIC3 and ASIC2 mRNAs were expressed in Calu-3 cells, human airway, pancreatic, and colonic epithelial cells. ASIC3 and CFTR co-segregated in the apical membrane of polarized Calu-3 monolayers. Co-immunoprecipitation of native and heterologously expressed CFTR and ASIC3 proteins suggests that these two proteins may interregulate each other via a physical association. ASIC3 channels functionally contribute to transepithelial Na+ transport, which is down-regulated by CFTR in Calu-3 cells. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from Calu-3 (submucosal cells), 16HBE14o (bronchial cells), CFPAC (pancreatic cells), and T84 (colonic cells) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was assessed by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. RNA quality was confirmed by running 5 μg of total RNA from each preparation on a 1.2% denatured agarose gel. The first strand cDNAs were synthesized using the Superscript™ first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR analysis of ASIC3 expression, the forward and reverse primers were 5′-TAT GAG ACC GTG GAG CAG-3′ and 5′-TGT GTG ACA AGG TAG CAG G-3′, which correspond to nucleotides 1279-1296 and 1610-1592, respectively, of ASIC3 (GenBank™ accession number AF057711) (37Berdiev B.K.

Two microliters of the first strand product was used as a template in each 50-μl PCR reaction, and PCR conditions were optimized using the PCR Optimizer™ kit (Invitrogen). The cycling parameters consisted of one cycle of 95 °C for 3 min and then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 0.5 min, 58 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min followed by a single 10-min cycle at 72 °C for extension. RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel using 100-bp PCR markers (Promega) as a standard to determine the molecular size. Products of the predicted molecular size were excised and purified from the gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into the pCR-2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Positive clones were selected by blue/white screening and followed by digestion with EcoRI (Promega) to verify incorporation of the insert of the correct size. PCR products in the pCR2.1 vector were verified by automated DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, Iowa State University). Immunofluorescent Staining—Calu-3 cells were grown as polarized monolayers on 12-mm tissue culture inserts (Costar). Three percent formaldehyde-fixed cells were stained by incubating with the primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-ASIC3 antibody from Neuromics diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer) and mouse monoclonal anti-CFTR antibody from Chemicon 1:100 in blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. The samples were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline following blocking buffer incubation and exposed to the secondary antibodies (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 h at room temperature. The samples were mounted and imaged using an Olympus 1 × 70 epifluorescence microscope. Negative controls consisted of substituting non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. For imaging side views of the Calu-3 monolayers, the filters were folded sharply, and the cells at the folded edge were photographed. Oocyte Expression and Voltage Clamp Assay— cRNA for ASIC3 and CFTR were prepared as previously described (8Ji H.L. Chalfant M.L. Jovov B. Lockhart J.P. Parker S.B. Fuller C.M. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J.

In brief, patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (20-24 °C) 2-4 days after seeding (39Ji H.L. Jovov B. Fu J. Bishop L.R. Mebane H.C. Fuller C.M. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

The reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl pellet in the bath (in mm: Na+ 130, Cl- 148, Ca2+ 2, Mg2+ 2, Ba2+ 5, HEPES 20, pH 7.4/NaOH). HEPES was substituted by MES to prepare the bath solutions at a pH below 6.0. The patch pipettes were pulled from fire-polished borosilicate glass (WPI Instruments) using a multistepped micropipette puller (model P97, Flaming/Brown) followed by fire polishing. An Axopatch 1B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) was used to record the current. Resistance of the electrode was 3-6 MΩ when filled with pipette solution (in mm: Cs+ 120, triethanolamine+ 20, Na+ 5, Cl- 144, Mg2+ 2, HEPES 10, EDTA 2.0, Ca2+ 0.1 (free Ca2+ 10 nm), pH 7.2/CsOH). Currents were digitized at 2-5 kHz by DigiData 1200, which was driven by CLAMPEX version 7.0 (Axon). The data were filtered at 1-2 kHz. Delivery of superfusates at various pH values were controlled by the SF-77B perfusion fast step system (Warner) and CLAMPEX version 7.1. Solutions from the square perfusion tubing with a size of 1 × 1 mm covered the clamped cell completely. Approximately 1 ms was measured to switch perfusate tubing from one to another in a chamber of 0.1 ml. Ussing Chamber Studies—Calu-3 monolayers were mounted into Ussing chambers (Jim's Instrument Manufacturing, Inc., Iowa City, IA) and bathed with solution consisting of (in mm): Na+ 145, K+ 5, Ca2+ 1.2, Mg2+ 1.2, gluconic acid 125, HEPES 10, glucose 10 (pH 7.4). Bath solution in the apical chamber contained 10 mm mannitol in place of glucose to minimize the contribution of the Na+-glucose co-transporter to the Na+ transport. Bath solutions were continuously bubbled with 100% N2, combined with both HPO4- -free and HCO3- -free medium to eliminate pH buffering and the activity of the HCO3- -dependent transporter/exchangers (pH 7.4). Bath solutions were maintained at 37 °C. The monolayers were voltage-clamped at 0 mV. Transepithelial short circuit current (Isc) and resistance (RTE) were simultaneously measured using 5-mV pulses every 20 s. Data were recorded for off-line analysis using the Acquire and Analyze program combined with an epithelial voltage clamp amplifier VCC MC8 (Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San Diego, CA). After stabilization of the basal Isc, the pH of the apical or basolateral solution was adjusted to 6.8 by 1 m HCl. A pH of 6.8 was chosen, because more acidic pH values would have altered gap junction and possibly the intracellular pH (40Peracchia C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 61-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Clinically, pH 6.8 is within the range of acidic CF luminal fluid (29Freedman S.D. Kern H.F. Scheele G.A.

Physiol. 2006; 290: C741-C749Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have recently reported that the pH of mucus stimulated with pilocarpine is from ∼6.6 to ∼6.9. The pH values of bath solutions were concurrently monitored by a digital pH meter during Ussing chamber experiments (Corning). Western Blotting and Co-immunoprecipitation—Calu-3 cells were split and plated, per 75-mm flask, with minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro), 1% glutamine, and 1% strep and penicillin for 48 h. The cells were lysed in 0.7 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris buffer pH 7.5) with a freshly added protein inhibitor mixture tablet (44Hardiman K.M. McNicholas-Bevensee C.M. Fortenberry J. Myles C.T. Malik B. Eaton D.C. Matalon S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays were performed as described previously (44Hardiman K.M. McNicholas-Bevensee C.M. Fortenberry J. Myles C.T. Malik B. Eaton D.C. Matalon S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 45Ji H.L. Su X.F. Kedar S. Li J. Barbry P. Smith P.R. Matalon S. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8233-8241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Equivalency of loading for Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation was ensured by performing protein assays (BCA; Pierce) and using equal amounts of protein for each group. Briefly, anti-CFTR monoclonal antibody (University of Alabama at Birmingham) or anti-ASIC3 polyclonal antibody (Chemicon) was added into the cell lysates of the protein samples and rotated at 4 °C overnight. For co-immunoprecipitation, the protein complexes were immunoprecipitated by protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the samples were loaded and run in either 6 or 8% SDS-PAGE gel. The precipitates were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted by different antibodies. All blots were developed by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). For co-immunoprecipitation in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transiently transfect ASIC3 and CFTR following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell protein was purified for CFTR and ASIC3 expression 2 days post-transfection. The amount of plasmid DNA used per 35-mm dish was 2 μg for CFTR in pcDNA3 and 1 μg for rat ASIC3 in pCI per 35-mm dish. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). CFTR was immunoprecipitated using 1 μg of anti-C-terminal CFTR monoclonal antibody cross-linked to protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubating the lysates with cross-linked antibody, the beads were pelleted and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, and the samples were processed for Western blotting using the monoclonal anti-CFTR antibody (Chemicon) or polyclonal anti-ASIC3 antibody (Neuromics). Data Analysis—Proton-activated Na+ current was calculated as the difference between the basal current and sustained current at acidic pH. The EC50 value of external pH was computed by fitting the dose-response curve with the Hill equation INa = Imax · pHon/(pHon + EC50n) (39Ji H.L. Jovov B. Fu J. Bishop L.R. Mebane H.C. Fuller C.M. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8395-8405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), where INa represents the proton-activated current, Imax the maximal proton-activated current, pHo the extraoocyte pH, EC50 the value of pHo that results in half of the maximal current of the ASIC3 channel, and n the Hill coefficient. All average results are presented as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance computation combined with the Bonferroni test was used to analyze data with unequal variance between each group. A probability level of 0.05 was considered significant. ASIC3 mRNA in CFTR-expressing Human Epithelial Cells— The expression of ASIC3 in airway and other epithelial cells has not been examined previously. Our RT-PCR results revealed that ASIC3 mRNA was present in CFTR-expressing human epithelial cell lines Calu-3 (submucosal cells), 16HBE14o (bronchial cells), CFPAC (pancreatic cells), and T84 (colonic cells) (Fig. 1). However, ASIC1 (585 bp) was not detected in Calu-3 cells. Interestingly, expression of ASIC2 mRNA was also detected in these epithelial cells. The RT-PCR products (585 bp for ASIC1, 503 bp for ASIC2, and 351 bp for ASIC3) from each cell line were ligated into the pCR2.1 vector and sequenced. BLAST analysis revealed that sequences of the RT-PCR products were identical to corresponding human ASIC1, -2, and -3. ASIC3 Protein Expression in Human CF Lung Tissues—Because ASIC channels are regulated by protons and inflammatory mediators (46Mamet J. Baron A. Lazdunski M. Voilley N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10662-10670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Voilley N. de Weille J. Mamet J. Lazdunski M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of ASIC3 in CF lung may be enhanced by acidic luminal fluid and infection. To examine the expression of ASIC3 in normal and CF lung tissues, we immunolabeled human lung tissue sections with a specific anti-ASIC3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, ASIC3 was expressed in the pneumocytes of human lung alveoli. In CF lung, the normal alveolar structure was altered by the aggregation of inflammatory cells and propagation of non-flat abnormal alveolar cells (Fig. 2, E and F). ASIC3 expression, as shown by the brightness of the green color, is greater in CF lung sections due to inflammation than that in non-CF tissues. Immunolabeling of ASIC3 was not detected when the anti-ASIC3 antibody was neutralized with ASIC3 immunopeptide (Fig. 2, A and D). Co-segregation of ASIC3 and CFTR in the Apical Membrane of Calu-3 Monolayers—To examine the subcellular location of ASIC3 and its possible co-expression with CFTR, Calu-3 monolayers grown on filters and cultured with an air-liquid interface were incubated with specific anti-ASIC3 (green channel) and anti-CFTR (red channel) antibodies. Lateral views of the monolayers show that ASIC3 is located in the apical membrane of most Calu-3 cells (Fig. 2, A and D). In agreement with previous observations (38Bebok Z. Varga K. Hicks J.K. Venglarik C.J. Kovacs T. Chen L. Hardiman K.M. Collawn J.F. Sorscher E.J. Matalon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43041-43049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), CFTR was also observed in the apical membrane of Calu-3 cells (Fig. 2, B and E). Merged images indicate that ASIC3 and CFTR are co-segregated with each other within the apical membrane domain of Calu-3 cells (Fig. 2, C and F). Apical labeling of the monolayers was not observed when non-immune rabbit and mouse IgG were substituted for the anti-ASIC3 and -CFTR antibodies, respectively. To verify these immunostaining results, Western blot assay was used to determine the ASIC3 and CFTR protein in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). A 75-kDa protein was shown with an identical size as in dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 3B). As previously reported (38Bebok Z. Varga K. Hicks J.K. Venglarik C.J. Kovacs T. Chen L. Hardiman K.M. Collawn J.F. Sorscher E.J. Matalon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43041-43049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), CFTR protein is expressed in Calu-3 cells abundantly (Fig. 3C). ASIC3-type Channel Activity in Calu-3 Monolayers—If ASIC3 functions as a Na+ channel, the channel should be activated by lowering apical pH. To test this hypothesis, we bathed Calu-3 cells with HPO3- -free, HCO3- -free, Cl--free medium on both sides and bubbled them with pure gaseous nitrogen. Lowering the apical pH from 7.5 to 6.8 resulted in a transient followed by a sustained activation of an apical Na+ current (Fig. 4). The proton activation was repeatable. In the presence of amiloride (100 μm), an increase of apical proton concentration did not elicit acid-sensitive sustained Isc (Fig. 4). Putative Proton-gated Whole-cell Na+ Current in Calu-3 Cells—To further characterize the putative ASIC3 channels in individual Calu-3 cells, we applied a series of external pH values from 4.0 to 8.5 after the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp assay was established (Fig. 5). In 27 of 32 cells, a transiently activated current and a sustained current were activated by protons, whereas alkali pH (8.5) inhibited basal current slightly (5A). An EC50 value of 5.2 for proton activation was determined (5.2 ± 0.1, n = 6) by fitting the dose-response curve with the Hill equation (Fig. 5B). Multiple sites were required for proton activation (Hill coefficient, 12 ± 3), which supports previous publications on this topic (20Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. De Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Krishtal O. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 477-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Seventy percent of this proton-gated current was abolished in Na+-free medium. The gating pattern of proton-dependent Na+ current and the EC50 value for proton activation in Calu-3 cells were identical to those of cloned ASIC3 but not ASIC1a and -2a channels (48Hesselager M. Timmermann D.B. Ahring P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11006-11015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The large sustained current, which tends to become stable, is a hallmark of homo- and heteromeric ASIC3, which is not observed in other ASIC channels. Down-regulation of Putative ASIC3 Na+ Channels by cAMP-activated CFTR in Calu-3 Cells—To investigate the effect of CFTR activation on the proton-gated ASIC3-type Na+ current in Calu-3 cells, proton-gated Na+ currents from a group of cells in the absence of forskolin were compared with those obtained from a parallel group in the presence of 10 μm forskolin. After CFTR activity reached its maximum in whole-cell patch clamp mode and was stabilized at neutral pH (7.5), pH 6.0 was applied to activate native ASIC3 (Fig. 5C). The proton-gated sustained Na+ current in Calu-3 cells in the presence of forskolin was -33 ± 16 pA (n = 5), which was markedly less than the controls in the absence of forskolin (-154 ± 28 pA, n = 5, p < 0.01). To exclude the direct effect of forskolin on ASIC3 activity, we expressed ASIC3 in oocytes and measured whole-cell currents using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique before and after the addition of forskolin at pH 6.0. The ASIC3 current at -60 mV was not altered by forskolin (Fig. 5D). These results were consistent with our previous observation that elevation of cAMP does not have an effect on αβγ ENaC and ASIC1a/2a channels expressed in oocytes (8Ji H.L. Chalfant M.L. Jovov B.

https://openalex.org/W2006267341,"Aggregated and highly phosphorylated tau protein is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. We identified motifs of alternating polar and apolar amino acids within the microtubule-binding repeats of tau which were interrupted by small breaking stretches. Minimal mutation of these breaking sequences yielded a unique instantly aggregating tau mutant containing longer stretches of polar/apolar amino acids without losing its microtubule-binding capacity. These modifications produced rapid aggregation and cytotoxicity with accompanying occurrence of pathologic tau phosphoepitopes (AT8, AT180, AT270, AT100, Ser422, and PHF-1) and conformational epitopes (MC-1 and Alz50) in cells. Similar to pathological tau in the pretangle state, toxicity appeared to occur early without the requirement for extensive fibril formation. Thus, our mutant protein provides a novel platform for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms for toxicity and cellular behavior of pathologically aggregated tau proteins and the identification of its interaction partners.

Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are a pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, which include Alzheimer disease (AD), 3The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; FTDP-17, frontotemporal dementia with Parkinson syndrome linked to chromosome 17; MTBR, microtubule-binding repeat; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EM, electron microscopy; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; PT, post-transfection. 3The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; FTDP-17, frontotemporal dementia with Parkinson syndrome linked to chromosome 17; MTBR, microtubule-binding repeat; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EM, electron microscopy; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; PT, post-transfection. frontotemporal dementia with Parkinson syndrome linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), and others (1Spillantini M.G.

Aging. 2000; 21: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These aggregates can become entangled in the form of neurofibrillary tangles that are held responsible for neuronal cell death via yet unknown intracellular mechanisms. The tau protein exists as a naturally unfolded protein that is associated with microtubules. However, within pathological aggregates like neurofibrillary tangles, a β-strand conformation can be identified (3Gamblin T.C. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15009-15017Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4von Li L. Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41390-41400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The physiological function of tau involves the binding and stabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. It exists as several splicing isoforms in the central nervous system. The expression levels of the different isoforms vary during the development and maturation of the central nervous system. This probably serves to modulate neuronal microtubule stability and function. The tau isoforms contain three or four C-terminal microtubule-binding repeats (MTBRs) and one or two acidic residues at the N terminus. The latter domains are not directly involved in the binding of microtubules, whereas the MTBRs of tau bind to the acidic C terminus of the tubulin monomers. The naturally unfolded nature of tau is probably explained by the fact that an extended conformation allows its interaction with several tubulin dimers (5von Barghorn S. Bergen M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the course of several diseases of the nervous system, tau molecules aggregate in the form of pathological multimers. Isolated tau protein exhibits a tendency to aggregate in the form of fibrils when incubated in the presence of polyanionic compounds or fatty acid-like molecules (3Gamblin T.C. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15009-15017Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the third MTBR contains a sequence that aggregates in isolated form (6von Friedhoff P. Bergen M. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), and accordingly, the MTBRs have been shown to be located in the core of fibrils by tryptophan fluorescence scanning spectroscopy (4von Li L. Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41390-41400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the relevance of these findings for aggregation of the intact tau protein inside cells remains to be elucidated. Despite the detailed information gained from these in vitro studies, attempts to obtain more mechanistic insights by reconstruction of aggregation-mediated disease models in cell culture and animals have proven to be difficult. Various models producing an AD-like tau pathology exist in rodents, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and others (7Gotz J. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2001; 35: 266-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Wittmann C.W. Wszolek M.F. Shulman J.M. Salvaterra P.M. Lewis J. Hutton M. Feany M.B. Science. 2001; 293: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). These animal models take a considerable part of the life span before they develop pathological features and do not readily allow the progression of cellular pathology and toxicity to be followed. Current cellular model systems based on tau expression fail to reliably model AD-like tau pathology, since they are unable to simultaneously show hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, and tau-related toxicity. Okadaic acid treatment of neuroblastoma cells (10Perez M. Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos A. Smith M. Perry G. Avila J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1484-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) results in tau hyperphosphorylation, but its possible toxicity effects are masked by the high toxicity of the okadaic acid per se. Tau polymerization in neuroblastoma cells occurs upon incubation with preaggregated amyloid-β peptide, but its effects cannot be uncoupled from the high toxicity of the amyloid-β protein itself (11Ferrari A. Hoerndli F. Baechi T. Nitsch R.M. Gotz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40162-40168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Expression of an FTDP-17 triple mutant of tau in CHO cells (12Vogelsberg-Ragaglia V. Bruce J. Richter-Landsberg C. Zhang B. Hong M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4093-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) shows morphological tau inclusions but fails to reveal toxicity effects and moreover shows a decreased phosphorylation. A cellular model based on the conditional expression of a tau repeat domain carrying the ΔK280 familial tau mutation was described recently (13Khlistunova I. Biernat J. Wang Y. von Pickhardt M. Bergen M. Gazova Z. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1205-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It reveals aggregation, toxicity, and hyperphorsporylation, but it is not clear how such a behavior will be modulated in the presence of the full-length tau sequence. There is therefore a high demand for an experimental model system that unifies prominent tau aggregation and cytotoxicity. We identified motifs of alternating polar and apolar amino acids in parts of the microtubule binding repeats of tau. These ordered patterns are known to impart α-helical or β-strand structure in selected protein domains (14Broome B.M. Hecht M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and could therefore locally introduce secondary structure inside the otherwise unstructured tau molecule. We noticed furthermore that these motifs were interrupted by short stretches of three or four amino acids, which we “bridged” by changing only one or two residues. This optimization served to increase the stability of these isolated structured motifs by the correction of “imperfections” in the pattern, leading to large motifs of alternating polar and apolar residues inside the tau protein. This approach carries relevance to the ΔK280 familial tau mutation that has been suggested before to have an increased tendency for aggregation due to the formation of an alternating “hydrophilic/hydrophobic” pattern (15von Barghorn S. Bergen M. Li L. Marx A. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48165-48174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These rational mutations resulted in a tau mutant that exhibits aggregation, pathological modifications, and toxicity in cellular systems within extremely short time frames. Our mutant tau system therefore represents a novel experimental tool for the study of AD and other tauopathies, which allows the facile introduction of highly aggregated tau species into living cells to aid in the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular responses that lead to cytotoxicity. Generation of DNA Vectors—The 441-amino acid form of human tau (WT-tau, GenBank™ accession number NM_005910; NCBI Protein Database accession number AAC04279; a kind gift from R. Brandt, University of Osnabrück, Germany) was cloned by PCR using the primers agagagcggccgcgccaccatggctgagccccgcca (NotI-Kozak-5′tau) and gcgcggatccctatcacaaaccctgcttggccag (3′tau-BamHI). The cDNA was inserted into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). N-terminal fusions with fluorescent protein (enhanced GFP, enhanced YFP, or enhanced CFP) were created using the 5′ NotI restriction site of tau and a flexible linker Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Gly between GFP and tau (16Tan K. Liu J. Wang J. Shen S. Lu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The mutant tau form (3PO-tau, for 3-repeat pattern-optimized tau) was produced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) using the following mutation primer pairs: MTBR2, caccagccgggaggcgggaaggtgcagataaatatcaagctggatcttagcaac (sense) and gttgctaagatccagcttgatatttatctgcaccttcccgcctcccggctggtg (antisense); MTBR3, cacgtcccgggaggcggcagtgtgcaaatatacgtc (sense) and cttgctcaggtcaactttgacgtatatttgcacact (antisense); MTBR4, cataaaccaggaggtggccaggtggaagtaaaaatcaagcttgacttcaaggacaga (sense) and tctgtccttgaagtcaagcttgatttttacttccacctggccacctcctggtttatg (antisense). WT- and 3PO-tau-GFP were transferred to a Semliki Forest Virus 2 vector (pSFV2; Invitrogen). Plasmids were purified using the EndoFree Maxi Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Cell Culturing—CHO cells, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, and BHK-21 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). CHO and BHK-21 cells were cultured in basal medium Eagle (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAN Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen). SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 16 embryos of C57BL/6 mice as described previously (17Iliev A.I. Stringaris A.K. Nau R. Neumann H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 412-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cells were cultivated in basal medium Eagle neuronal medium supplemented with 2% B-27 neuronal supplement (Invitrogen), 1% glucose (Sigma), and 1% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Neurons were seeded in 4-well chamber slides (Nunc GmbH & Co. KG, Wiesbaden, Germany) that were coated with 1 μg/ml poly-l-ornithine and laminin (Sigma). Gene Transfer and Viral Particle Production—Cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Semliki Forest Virus 2 particles were produced by in vitro transcription of the construct-containing vector and the Helper2 vector, followed by electroporation of the mRNA in BHK-21 cells in PBS using a Bio-Rad II electroporator (Bio-Rad) with a pulse of 360 V and a capacitance of 75 microfarads. Virus particles were collected and stored at 4 °C. Neurons were incubated with virus particles for 90 min at a multiplicity of infection of 0.001, after which the medium was replaced. 97% of transduced cells were neurons, as confirmed by β-tubulin III immunostaining. Experiments were performed within 30 h after transduction. Immunofluorescence and Electron Microscopy (EM)—For immunofluorescence studies, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde or methanol at -20 °C. Subsequently, the formaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, antibody incubations were performed for 1 h at room temperatures, extensively washed, and mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst KG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Primary antibodies and dilutions used were AT8 (1:500), AT180 (1:200), AT270 (1:200), AT100 (1:200) (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium), PHF-1 (1:500), MC1 (1:250), Alz50 (1:50) (generous gift from Prof. Peter Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), antiphospho-Ser422 (1:200) (Calbiochem, Merck Biosciences, Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany), anti-active caspase-3 (1:500) (BD Biosciences), anti-β-tubulin III (1:200) (Sigma), anti-α-tubulin (1:200) (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), and anti-C-terminal tau antibody (clone T46; 1:400) (Zytomed GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Corresponding IgG and IgM (Alz50) secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, Cy3, and Cy5 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used in a 1:200 dilution. TUNEL staining was performed using the InSitu Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. A positive control for apoptosis was provided by a 24-h incubation of cells with 10 μm staurosporine (Sigma). For electron microscopic analysis of Sarkosyl extracts, prepared as described previously (18Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), samples were absorbed on Formvar carbon-coated grids (PlanoGmbH) and counterstained with 2% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate. For electron microscopy on cells, the cells were fixed 24 h after transfection using 2% (w/v) formaldehyde and 0.25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (EM grade; Sigma) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. Pre-embedding labeling was performed to identify the transfected cells (19Humbel B.M. de Jong M.D. Muller W.H. Verkleij A.J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 42: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.045% (w/v) cold water fish gelatin (EM grade; Sigma) in PBS. Pre-embedding immunogold labeling was performed with the anti-C-terminal tau antibody (clone T46; 1:400) and 1.4-nm gold- and AlexaFluor488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes; 1:30) in PBS, 0.05% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Silver enhancement of the nanogold particles was performed using the LI Silver Enhancement Kit from Molecular Probes. Cells were gently scraped in PBS, collected, and post-fixed with 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide. The fixed cells were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol containing 0.5% uranylacetate and embedded in Araldit (Serva) by passage through propylene oxide and propylene oxide-Araldit (1:1) solutions followed by polymerization at 60 °C. Ultrathin sections were cut, mounted on Formvar-coated copper grids (Plano GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), and counterstained with 0.4% lead citrate. All samples were analyzed on a Zeiss EM 10B electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV. Imaging and Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—Confocal imaging was performed on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal system equipped with an AOBS (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). FRAP was performed on CHO cells 24 h PT grown in a 4-well chamber slide with a German borosilicate glass coverslip bottom (Nunc GmbH & Co. KG) using a heated ×63 oil objective and a thermostatted microscopy chamber. The cells were imaged in 142 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaHPO4, 25 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose, 0.8 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4, buffer and for not longer than 120 min. Bleaching was performed by repeated scanning (10 frames) at 488 nm with 100% laser power of a 4 × 4-μm size area. Immediately after bleaching, recovery images were acquired at 5-s intervals for 150-250 s with a laser power of 1-4% at 488 nm, and fluorescence was detected in a spectral window of 495-540 nm. WT-tau-YFP was bleached with the 514-nm laser and detected from 520 to 560 nm. 3PO-tau-CFP was bleached with the 458-nm laser and detected from 465 to 500 nm. Experiments were performed with the same laser settings. Toxicity and Cell Counting—Toxicity was analyzed by counting 3PO-tau-GFP- or WT-tau-GFP-expressing SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at 24, 48, and 72 h PT. Cell numbers were normalized to the number of cells at 24 h in the same microscopy fields of view and served as an internal reference for the toxicity evaluation. For immunofluorescence experiments, cell counting was performed as described previously (11Ferrari A. Hoerndli F. Baechi T. Nitsch R.M. Gotz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40162-40168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An average of 100 transfected cells were counted per preparation. Cells transfected with non-GFP-fused tau were identified on the basis of increased immunolabeling with an anti-C-terminal tau antibody. All toxicity experiments and other experiments with cell counting were repeated independently five times, and the results were represented as mean ± S.E. Protein Biochemistry—Western blotting was performed as described previously (20Dou F. Netzer W.J. Tanemura K. Li F. Hartl F.U. Takashima A. Gouras G.K. Greengard P. Xu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), and protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant and pellet fraction. For the immunodetection of phosphorylation epitopes, the samples were boiled under strong reducing conditions, using 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Amounts of protein were adjusted to contain equal amounts of tau and were loaded and subjected to 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by wet blotting (Bio-Rad) at 50 V for 3 h. The blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated with PHF-1 (1:1000), AT8 (1:1000), or anti-C-terminal tau (clone T46; 1:2000) primary antibodies for 1 h. The primary antibodies were detected with the corresponding goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Dianova), and the signal was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Sarkosyl extracts were absorbed onto nitrocellulose membranes using slot blotting and detected by the anti-C-terminal tau antibody (clone T46; 1:2000). Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed using Graph-Pad Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed using NIH Image 1.62 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Modification of MTBRs Producing an Instantly Aggregating Tau Mutant—We identified motifs of 4 or 5 amino acids consisting of alternating polar/apolar residues in the second, third, and fourth MTBR of the 441-amino acid-long form of human wild-type tau (WT-tau) (Fig. 1, upper panel). Each of these MTBRs contains two such motifs (MTBR2, 274KVQI277 and 281KLDLS285; MTBR3, 305SVQI308 and 313VDLS316; MTBR4, 336QVEVK340 and 343KLDFK347) situated after the flexible PGGG repeats. These motifs are separated by a short breaking stretch of 2-4 amino acids that interrupts the optimal polar/apolar pattern. We mutated these small breaking sequences, thereby forming a sequential motif of 11 alternating polar and apolar amino acid residues in each of the second, third, and fourth MTBR (Fig. 1, lower panel). The breaking sequence 278INK280 in MTBR2 was optimized by inversion of Ile278 and Asn279, followed by the deletion of Lys280. The breaking sequence 309VYKP312 in MTBR3 was optimized by inversion of Val309 and Tyr310 and the subsequent deletion of the structure breaking Pro312. The breaking sequence 341SE342 in MTBR4 was optimized by replacing these two polar amino acids with one apolar amino acid, isoleucine. In this manner, we created a mutant tau protein (3PO-tau for 3-repeat pattern-optimized tau) that is pattern-optimized for aggregation. We expressed the WT-tau and 3PO-tau in CHO cells, which lack endogenous tau, to examine the microtubule interactions and behavior of the proteins. Both the WT-tau and 3PO-tau showed normal microtubule localization at early times (within the first 12 h after transfection) (Fig. 2A). During this initial period, 3PO-tau was properly transported within the cytosol without the formation of inclusions. Furthermore, proper microtubule binding was observed, indicating that the microtubule binding function of the proteins bearing modified MTBRs was unperturbed in the early times after transfection. After 24 h of transfection, the 3PO-tau staining revealed morphologically prominent bulky aggregates and amorphous aggregates in the majority of transfected cells (more than 60% of these cells) (Fig. 2, A and C). The aggregation pattern was heterogeneous in the form of small punctate aggregates (∼30% of the transfected cells) to large spherical aggregates, consistent with inclusion bodies (∼10% of the transfected cells) or amorphous aggregates (∼20% of the transfected cells) that occupy a significant portion of the cytosol. The use of GFP fusion constructs of 3PO-tau produced identical morphological results when compared with untagged 3PO-tau as detected by immunofluorescence using tau antibodies. Western blotting of cell lysates of WT-tau and 3PO-tau-transfected CHO cells showed the presence of higher molecular weight aggregates consisting of di- and oligomeric 3PO-tau complexes (molecular mass ∼130 kDa and higher) both in the detergent-soluble and in the detergent-insoluble fractions (Fig. 2B). A monomeric product (∼60-65 kDa) was detected in the detergent-soluble fraction of both the WT-tau- and 3PO-tau-expressing cells. To verify the role of the individual MTBR modifications in tau aggregation, we also constructed several partial mutations, designated M3, M34, and M23, to indicate the modified repeats. The modifications demonstrated a dose-dependent phenotype as aggregation accumulated with increasing modification, 3PO-tau being most potent (Fig. 2C). However, this also shows that all breaking sequences inside polar/apolar patterns have the same effect on preventing aggregation. In contrast to pathological tau oligomers in human brain tangles and in vitro aggregated tau, we did not detect staining with the fibril-sensitive dyes thioflavin-S and -T and thiazin red in cells expressing 3PO-tau. We also did not observe fibrillary structures in Sarkosyl extracts of 3PO-tau cell lysates by immunoelectron microscopy. This was confirmed by the absence of tau immunoreactivity in slot blot analysis of these Sarkosyl extracts (not shown). We performed EM with pre-embedding nanogold immunolabeling of tau, followed by silver enhancement, to identify transfected cells. Whereas only a few scattered isolated particles could be detected in WT-tau-expressing cells, numerous large clusters of silver-enhanced gold particles were observed in the cytosol of 3PO-tau-expressing cells. The reduced staining of the WT-tau-expressing cells is attributed to the known solubilization of the microtubule-bound tau under formaldehyde fixation (21Schliwa M. Euteneuer U. Bulinski J.C. Izant J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and the extensive permeabilization necessary for pre-embedding labeling. Since fibrils are highly resistant to detergent extraction, they would have coincided with the strong tau immunoreactivity had they been formed. The absence of discernable fibrillary structures indicates that tau aggregates form in a nonfibrillary manner (Fig. 2D). FRAP Analysis of Aggregation Dynamics—We examined the aggregation properties of GFP-labeled 3PO-tau using FRAP in CHO cells. After 24 h, WT-tau-GFP exhibited an exponential recovery after bleaching with a half-time of ∼13 s and a mobile fraction of ∼96%. In comparison, 3PO-tau-GFP revealed a nearly complete immobility with a very slow linear course of recovery, typical for aggregating proteins, only reaching a recovery of ∼14% at 250 s after bleaching. FRAP dynamics on 3PO-tau-GFP-expressing cells showed two populations with distinct slower dynamics at earlier time points (6-8 h) of expression, at which tau is still bound to the microtubules without obvious signs of aggregation. A substantial immobility of 3PO-tau with a mobile fraction of ∼56% and a recovery half-time of ∼160 s (Fig. 3A) was found in strongly expressing cells as judged by confocal imaging with standardized settings and intensity thresholding. Weakly expressing cells, on the other hand, exhibited a higher motility and an exponential recovery with a mobile fraction of ∼96% and a recovery half-time of ∼98 s. (Fig. 3A). This indicated that 3PO-tau aggregated into multimeric complexes very soon after the onset of expression and in a time- and expression level-dependent manner. FRAP analysis of the partial forms of 3PO-tau (M3, M34, and M23) after 24 h of expression confirmed the cumulative nature of the individual MTBR mutations (supplemental Fig. S1). Next, we investigated the possible induction of aggregation of wild-type tau by 3PO-tau. 3PO-tau-CFP and WT-tau-YFP were co-expressed, and the WT-tau-YFP motility was analyzed by FRAP. A pronounced “all-or-none” cellular response with distinct behaviors was observed; 78% of the double-transfected cells showed typical WT-tau-YFP diffusion rates, whereas 22% of the cells showed a reduced recovery with a half-time of ∼46 s and a mobile fraction of ∼35% (Fig. 3B). These effects were not correlated with the relative expression levels of both constructs as judged by CFP/YFP fluorescence ratio measurements (not shown). Surprisingly, in half of the population of cells that exhibited normal WT-tau-YFP motility, WT-tau-YFP showed an aggregated appearance as its signal co-localized with 3PO-tau (supplementary Fig. S2). This indicates that the mechanism by which 3PO-tau forms aggregates still allows the recognition and inclusion of WT-tau. Nevertheless, as its high motility suggests, WT-tau escapes from inclusion in 3PO-tau aggregates in the majority of cells for unknown reasons. This shows that 3PO-tau aggregates do not simply act as a nonspecific steric trap for proteins. Hyperphosphorylation and Pathological Conformation of 3PO-tau—A typical feature of aggregated tau in AD and other tauopathies is the increased phosphorylation at specific epitopes. These modifications were also present in our 3PO-tau model. The increase of PHF-1 (simultaneous phosphorylation at Ser396/Ser404) and AT8 (phospho-Ser202/phospho-Thr205) phosphoepitopes in expressed polymeric 3PO-tau was demonstrated by Western blotting of total CHO cell extracts (Fig. 4A). Subsequent densitometric analysis of the PHF-1 staining revealed an ∼5-fold increase of Ser396/Ser404 phosphorylation in cells transfected with 3PO-tau compared with WT-tau. AT8 staining was detected almost exclusively in 3PO-tau-expressing cells. Next, we assessed 3PO-tau phosphorylation in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. SH-SY5Y cells natively express several tau isoforms and represent an experimental system that is closer to neurons. All experiments with GFP-fused tau proteins were validated with nonfused proteins detected by an anti-C-terminal tau antibody (clone T46). For the phosphorylat"

The virus has evolved strategies to escape immune clearance by remaining latent in most infected cells in vivo. We demonstrated previously that virally encoded p30 protein is a potent post-transcriptional inhibitor of virus replication (Nicot, C., Dundr, M., Johnson, J. M., Fullen, J. R., Alonzo, N., Fukumoto, R., Princler, G. L., Derse, D., Misteli, T., and Franchini, G. (2004) Nat. Med. 10, 197-201). p30 is unable to shuttle out of the nucleus in heterokaryon assays, suggesting the existence of specific retention signals. Because suppression of virus replication relies on nuclear retention of the tax/rex mRNA by p30, determining the retention features of p30 will offer hints to break latency in infected cells and insights into new therapeutic approaches. In this study, we used live cell imaging technologies to study the kinetics of p30 and to delineate its retention signals and their function in virus replication. Notably, this is the first study to identify p30 nucleolar retention domains. Using mutants of p30 that localized in different cellular compartments, we show that post-transcriptional control of virus replication by p30 occurs in the nucleoplasm. We further demonstrate that p30 nuclear/nucleolar retention is dependent upon de novo RNA transcripts and interactions with components of the ribosomal machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2009180555,"Using the osmotic stress technique together with a self-cleavage assay we measure directly differences in sequestered water between specific and nonspecific DNA-BamHI complexes as well as the numbers of water molecules released coupled to specific complex formation. The difference between specific and nonspecific binding free energy of the BamHI scales linearly with solute osmolal concentration for seven neutral solutes used to set water activity. The observed osmotic dependence indicates that the nonspecific DNA-BamHI complex sequesters some 120-150 more water molecules than the specific complex. The weak sensitivity of the difference in number of waters to the solute identity suggests that these waters are sterically inaccessible to solutes. This result is in close agreement with differences in the structures determined by x-ray crystallography. We demonstrate additionally that when the same solutes that were used in competition experiments are used to probe changes accompanying the binding of free BamHI to its specific DNA sequence, the measured number of water molecules released in the binding process is strikingly solute-dependent (with up to 10-fold difference between solutes). This result is expected for reactions resulting in a large change in a surface exposed area."
https://openalex.org/W2027852497,"E2A and HEB are basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that play important roles in T cell development. Expression of Id1, one of their inhibitors, severely impairs T cell development in transgenic mice. Aberrant activation of NF-κB transcription factors has been shown to contribute to the developmental defects, but it is not clear whether NF-κB activation is directly due to Id1 expression or is secondary to an abnormal thymic environment in Id1 transgenic mice. Here, by using a T cell line model, we demonstrate that Id1 expression stimulates basal levels of NF-κB activity and further enhances NF-κB activation upon T cell receptor (TCR) signaling achieved by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation. Activation of NF-κB is partially mediated by the classical pathway involving the interaction between the regulatory subunit, NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), and the catalytic subunit, IκB kinase β. However, a NEMO-independent pathway also appears to be at play. Id1-potentiated activation of NF-κB leads to overproduction of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α and interferon-γ in a T cell line as well as in thymocytes. Among members of the NF-κB family, c-Rel appears to be preferentially activated by Id1, especially during TCR stimulation.

Consistently, c-rel deficiency diminishes tumor necrosis factor α and interferon-γ expression induced by Id1 and TCR signaling. Transcriptional regulation of gene expression plays crucial roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This is orchestrated by coordinated efforts of various families of transcription factors. Each family of transcription factors is further regulated by specific stimuli or in a temporal and spatial-specific manner. However, cross-talk between different families of transcription factors also exists. In this report, we describe the influence of basic helix-loop-helix proteins on the activity of NF-κB transcription factors and the consequences of such an influence. The NF-κB family consists of p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 (NF-κB1), and p52/p100 (NF-κB2) (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). All members possess the Rel homology domain responsible for dimerization, DNA binding, and interaction with IκB proteins. However, p65, RelB, and c-Rel carry a transcription activation domain, which enables homodimers of these proteins or heterodimers between these proteins and p50 or p52 to activate transcription of target genes. In response to different stimuli, a large number of genes are regulated by NF-κB transcription factors, among which are various cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) 2The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; IFNγ, interferon-γ; TCR, T cell receptor; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; IKK, IκB kinases; DP, CD4 and CD8 double positive; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. and interferon-γ (IFNγ) (2Karin M.

Although p65 and p50 are ubiquitously expressed, RelB, c-Rel, and p52 are largely expressed by cells of hematopoietic lineages, possibly serving their specialized functions (6Liou H.C. Hsia C.Y. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 767-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the absence of stimulation, NF-κB transcription factors are retained in the cytoplasm through association with IκB proteins (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar, 7Ghosh S. Ghosh S. Handbook of Transcription Factor NF-κB. Taylor & Francis CRC Press, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2006: 107-157Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by a range of inducers, IκB proteins become phosphorylated and degraded through an ubiquitin-mediated process, thus allowing NF-κB proteins to translocate into the nucleus and function as transcription factors. Phosphorylation of IκB molecules is mediated by IκB kinases, IKKα and -β, which are involved in two known pathways leading to NF-κB activation. In the classical pathway, NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), which receives signals from various signaling pathways, forms complexes with IKKα and -β and causes their activation (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar, 8Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). In the alternative pathway, IKKα homodimers are formed in response to inducers such as lymphoprotein β and B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family and phosphorylate p100, causing its cleavage to generate p52 (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In T lymphoid cells, antigen binding to T cell receptors (TCRs) leads to the activation of IKKβ/NEMO complexes through the interaction and function of a series of adaptor and kinase molecules (10Weil R. Israel A. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Such complicated activation mechanisms provide ample opportunities for other cellular factors to intervene in the activation process. NF-κB activation has been shown to be important for thymocyte survival following pre-TCR signaling and for activation of peripheral T cells upon TCR stimulation (10Weil R. Israel A.

Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors encoded by the E2A and HEB genes play crucial roles in T cell development (12Engel I. Murre C. Nat. Rev.

The function of these proteins, collectively called E proteins, can be diminished by a family of dominant negative inhibitors consisting of Id1 to Id4. Although their activities are necessary for the earliest stage of T cell commitment and differentiation, E proteins also regulate the function of pre-TCR and TCR by controlling the threshold of signaling (14Bain G.

Production of functional pre-TCR, monitored by the β selection checkpoint, allows the progression of double negative thymocytes to the CD4 and CD8 double positive (DP) stage. Thymocytes that express TCRs failing to recognize self-major histocompatibility complex molecules present in the thymus die in a process called “death by neglect.” In contrast, those thymocytes express TCRs that bind too strongly to self-major histocompatibility complex/peptide complexes in the thymus undergo apoptosis and are eliminated by negative selection. Thus only thymocytes that express TCRs capable of recognizing self-major histocompatibility complex/peptide complexes with limited affinity develop further as the result of positive selection (20Alberola-Ila J.

Interestingly, signaling from pre-TCR and TCR causes down-regulation of E2A and HEB function by transient stimulation of Id3 expression (15Engel I. Johns C. Bain G. Rivera R.R. Murre C. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 733-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 23Bain G. Cravatt C.B. Loomans C. Alberola-Ila J. Hedrick S.M. Murre C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This suggests that modulation of E protein function is an integral part of T cell differentiation driven by signaling from pre-TCR and TCR. However, the mechanism by which E proteins influence pre-TCR or TCR signaling remains poorly understood. Expression of the Id1 gene in thymocytes of transgenic mice effectively inhibits all E proteins and severely impairs T cell development (24Kim D. Peng X.C. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8240-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Like E2A deficiency, Id1 expression enables RAG1-deficient thymocytes to differentiate to the DP stage in the absence of TCR (25Kim D. Xu M. Nie L. Peng X.C. Jimi E. Voll R.E. Nguyen T. Ghosh S. Sun X.H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 9-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD4 single positive thymocytes from Id1 transgenic but not wild-type mice proliferate vigorously upon signaling from TCR by anti-CD3 treatment without co-stimulation through CD28 (26Qi Z. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 7313-7323Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Id1 transgenic DP thymocytes are completely eliminated under positively selecting conditions created by expression of H-Y or and TCR transgenes, a scenario reminiscent of negative selection. To address the underlying mechanisms, we have previously shown that NF-κB transcription factors, particularly c-Rel, are aberrantly activated in Id1 transgenic mice (25Kim D. Xu M. Nie L. Peng X.C. Jimi E. Voll R.E. Nguyen T. Ghosh S. Sun X.H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 9-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by expression of a constitutively active form of IKKβ exacerbated T cell deficiency, whereas inhibition of NF-κB with an IκB super repressor partially alleviated the developmental defect in Id1 transgenic mice. However, it is not clear whether NF-κB activation is directly due to Id1 expression or secondary to the developmental abnormalities occurring in Id1 transgenic thymuses. Here, by using a DP T cell line model system, we demonstrate the direct effects of Id1 expression or inhibition of E protein function on NF-κB activation before and after TCR stimulation and transcription of NF-κB downstream target genes, TNFα and IFNγ. These effects are similar to those found in DP thymocytes isolated from Id1 transgenic mice. These findings suggest that aberrant activation of NF-κB potentiated by Id1 may be one of the mechanisms underlying the developmental defects seen in Id1 transgenic mice. Mice, Cell Line, and Plasmids—Id1 transgenic mice were previously described as Id1–28 (24Kim D. Peng X.C. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8240-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), in which expression of the Id1 cDNA is driven by a T cell-specific proximal promoter of the lck gene. Mice lacking c-Rel were previously described by Tumang et al. (27Tumang J.R. Owyang A. Andjelic S. Jin Z. Hardy R.R. Liou M.L. Liou H.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4299-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The CD4 and CD8 double positive 16610D9 T cell line was derived from a p53-deficient T cell lymphoma (14Bain G. Quong M.W. Soloff R.S. Hedrick S.M. Murre C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To generate retroviral vectors, cDNA fragments encoding Id1 or E47 were inserted into the EcoRI site of the MIGR vector (28Pui J.C. Allman D. Xu L. DeRocco S. Karnell F.G. Bakkour S. Lee J.Y. Kadesch T. Hardy R.R. Aster J.C. Pear W.S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), which carries EGFP coding sequence downstream of the internal ribosomal entry site. The NF-κB reporter construct, pBIIx-luc, contains two NF-κB binding sites upstream of the c-fos minimal promoter (provided by S. Ghosh, Yale University School of Medicine). Cell Culture and Retrovirus Transduction—The Phoenix-E packaging cell line (29Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with retroviral vectors using the calcium phosphate precipitation method in the presence of 25 μm chloroquine. Twenty-four hours later, cultures were given fresh medium, and viral stocks were obtained by harvesting culture supernatants after incubation for an additional 24 h. To transduce 16610D9 cells, cells were resuspended at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in viral supernatants mixed with an equal volume of fresh medium supplemented with Polybrene at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml. The suspensions were then transferred to 6-well plates, and spin-infection was performed by centrifugation at 2200 rpm for 90 min at room temperature followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight and refreshment of medium. Typically, transduction efficiencies of 50–80% were obtained. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from thymocytes or 16610D9 cells by using an Nonidet P-40 lysis method and used in EMSA as described (25Kim D. Xu M. Nie L. Peng X.C. Jimi E. Voll R.E. Nguyen T. Ghosh S. Sun X.H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 9-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments, antibodies were added to the mixtures at the end of the binding reaction and incubated for an additional 5 min. Antibodies against p50, p65, c-Rel, relB, and E2A were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblotting—16610D9 cells with or without stimulation were lysed in radioimmuno-precipitation buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) plus a mixture of protease inhibitors, and supernatants were collected after centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA reagents (Pierce). Thirty micrograms of each protein extract was analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Antibodies against IKKβ, phospho-IKKα/β, IκBα, and phospho-IκBα were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Transient Transfection—1–2 × 107 16610D9 cells were transfected using a DEAE-DEXTRAN method. Briefly, cells were washed with TS solution (0.8% NaCl, 0.038% KCl, 0.01% Na2HPO4, 0.3% Tris HCl, pH to 7.4, 100 μg/ml each CaCl2 and MgCl2), resuspended in 1 ml of TS solution, DNA, 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-DEXTRAN mixture solution, and kept at room temperature for 15 min before 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μm chloroquine was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, cells were collected, washed with fresh medium, and then resuspended in fresh culture medium. After culturing for 20–40 h, cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (TROPIX, Bedford, MA). Luciferase assays were performed using a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Total amounts of transfected DNA were kept constant by supplementing appropriate amounts of empty vector DNA. For TCR stimulation, cells were resuspended at a density of 2 × 106/ml and chilled on ice. Antibodies against CD3 and CD28 (BD Biosciences) were added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml and incubated with the cells on ice for 10 min before the addition of anti-hamster IgG (Sigma) to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Cells were returned to 37 °C and incubated for desired periods. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells lysed with a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA templates were produced by reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse-transcriptase and DNase I-treated RNA samples. PCR amplification was performed using Taqman master mix and the ABI Prism 7700 machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR primers and real-time PCR fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes for IFNγ, TNFα, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Id1 Expression Activates NF-κB—We have previously shown that the DNA binding activities of NF-κB transcription factors are dramatically increased in nuclear extracts of thymocytes from Id1 transgenic mice when compared with wild-type mice (25Kim D. Xu M. Nie L. Peng X.C. Jimi E. Voll R.E. Nguyen T. Ghosh S. Sun X.H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 9-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To verify whether the increased activities are intrinsic to T cells, nuclear extracts were prepared from sorted CD4 and CD8 DP T cells of wild-type and Id1 transgenic mice and used in EMSA with NF-κB and Oct-1 probes. NF-κB binding activities were significantly increased in Id1 transgenic T cells when compared with wild-type T cells (Fig. 1A). As a control, Oct1 binding activity in both wild-type cells and Id1 transgenic cells was similar. This result demonstrates that the increased NF-κB binding activity in Id1 transgenic thymocytes is contributed by DP thymocytes. To determine whether NF-κB is directly activated by Id1 expression or indirectly by an abnormal thymic environment in Id1 transgenic mice, we utilized a CD4+CD8+ T cell lymphoma cell line, 16610D9. To test the effect of Id1 expression, 16610D9 cells were transduced with Id1-expressing or control vector retroviruses. Id1 expression abolished the E-box binding activity by E2A homodimers or E2A/HEB heterodimers since antibodies against E2A supershifted the binding complexes (Fig. 1B). To examine the effects of Id1 during TCR stimulation, vector- or Id1-transduced cells were stimulated with 2 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody plus or minus 2 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody along with anti-hamster IgG antibodies as cross-linkers of primary antibodies for 2 h at 37°C. Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed using EMSA with NF-κB and Oct-1 probes. Stimulation of TCR by anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies resulted in slight increases in NF-κB activities in vector-transduced cells. In contrast, Id1 expression significantly potentiated NF-κB activation induced by TCR stimulation (Fig. 1C, upper panel). NF-κB binding complexes in anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28-stimulated and Id1-expressing cells primarily consists of homodimers of p50 or heterodimers between p50 and p65, c-Rel, or RelB as suggested by the ability of anti-p50 antibodies to supershift the majority of complexes. Antibodies against p65, c-Rel, or RelB each supershifted a fraction of the slower migrating complexes but not the faster migrating complexes mostly composed of p50 homodimers (Fig. 1C, lower panel). We next performed immunoblot assays to measure nuclear translocation of c-Rel, p65, and RelB using nuclear extracts isolated from vector- or Id1-transduced 16610D9 cells treated with or without anti-CD3 alone or plus anti-CD28 (Fig. 1D). Although levels of nuclear p65 and RelB were similar in vector- and Id1-transduced cells, the level of c-Rel was markedly increased in Id1-transduced cells when stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies. Consistently, supershift assays using the same nuclear extracts also showed significant increases in c-Rel containing NF-κB binding complexes in Id1-expressing cells upon stimulation with anti-CD3 plus or minus anti-CD28 (Fig. 1D). Together, these results suggest that Id1 expression specifically enhances the activation of c-Rel transcription factors upon TCR signaling. Regulation of NF-κB Transcriptional Activity by Id1, E47, and IκB—To obtain functional data about regulation of NF-κB activity by Id1, we utilized a luciferase reporter gene controlled by a promoter containing two NF-κB binding sites in transient transfection assays. This reporter, pBIIx-luc, and a CMV-LacZ construct were co-transfected into 16610D9 cells with Id1- or E47-expressing constructs individually or together. Twenty-four hours after transfection, luciferase activities were measured and normalized against β-galactosidase activities, which served as internal controls for transfection efficiency. When compared with vector co-transfected cells, expression of Id1 caused over 4-fold increase in luciferase activity. In contrast, expression of E47 led to a 60% reduction in the basal level of reporter activity and an 85% reduction in Id1-stimulated expression of the reporter (Fig. 2A). When these transfected cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, luciferase activity in cells transfected with the reporter alone typically increased 3–5-fold depending on the overall condition of the cells and their ability to respond to stimulation. Id1-expressing cells when stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies increased NF-κB activity by about 10-fold when compared with unstimulated vector-transduced cells (Fig. 2A). However, E47 reduced reporter expression to a similar level as unstimulated vector control. Co-expression of E47 and Id1 completely eliminated the stimulatory effect of Id1 (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that inhibition of endogenous E protein function by Id1 results in activation of NF-κB, whereas increasing E protein levels inhibits NF-κB activities. To test whether Id1-induced activation of NF-κB can be inhibited by IκB, an IκBα super repressor (IκBα-SR), which is resistant to IKK-induced degradation, was co-transfected with NF-κB reporter and Id1 in the absence or presence of stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Under both conditions, the basal level of NF-κB was inhibited by IκBα-SR. Furthermore, activation of NF-κB caused by overexpression of Id1 can be completely blocked by co-expression of IκBα-SR (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrated that activation of NF-κBbyId1 expression as indicated by the reporter activity could be inhibited by IκB. Id1 Potentiates IKKβ Activation—To delineate the signaling pathway involved in Id1-potentiated NF-κB activation, the kinetics of activation of IKK complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against phospho-IKK molecules. Retrovirally transduced 16610D9 cells were stimulated with 2 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies and harvested at different time points. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against phospho-IKKα or β (Fig. 3A). The amount of total IKKβ was also measured as a loading control. Signaling through TCR caused a moderate level of IKKβ phosphorylation in vector-transduced cells starting at 2 min after stimulation of TCR, and the level began to decline after 1 h. In contrast, the magnitude of TCR-mediated phosphorylation of IKKβ was dramatically increased in Id1-expressing cells, although the kinetics of IKKβ activation remained the same. Phosphorylation of IKKα was not affected by either anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 stimulation or Id1 expression. Consistent with IKKβ activation, IκBα phosphorylation was also dramatically elevated in Id1-expressing cells, which led to a reduction in the level of total IκBα (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the kinetics of IκBα phosphorylation followed IKKβ activation. These results suggest that Id1 expression enables the cells to vigorously respond to TCR signaling by activating excessive levels of IKKβ. It is worth noting that in the absence of TCR stimulation, Id1 had little effect on IKKβ or IκBα phosphorylation, although Id1 could stimulate NF-κB reporter gene expression by severalfold (Figs. 2 and 3B), which suggests that additional mechanisms may be involved in NF-κB activation. TCR-mediated activation of IKKβ is known to be mediated through the classical pathway involving the interaction between the regulatory subunit of IKK complexes, NEMO, and the catalytic subunit, IKKβ (8Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of IKK complexes have been developed to disrupt the interaction between NEMO and IKKβ. NBD is a cell-permeable polypeptide containing the NEMO-binding domain of IKKβ and competes with endogenous IKKβ to interact with NEMO, thus acting as a dominant negative inhibitor (30May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). NBA is a control peptide containing mutations in the binding site. To test whether Id1-mediated activation of NF-κB utilizes the classical pathway, we measured Id1-stimulated NF-κB reporter expression in the presence of NBD or NBA, as well as antibodies against CD3 and CD28 (Fig. 3B). Upon stimulation with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for 2 h, NF-κB activities in Id1-expressing cells were significantly increased. The same treatments caused slight increases in NF-κB activities in control cells under this assay condition where 0.5 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody was used to best observe the stimulatory effect of Id1. The addition of NBD but not NBA inhibited NF-κB activation by about 50% in stimulated Id1-expressing cells, suggesting that the classical pathway for NF-κB activation following TCR signaling was partially involved. The residual NF-κB activity in Id1-expressing cells could be due to an incomplete inhibition of the classical pathway by NBD or contributed by a different activating mechanism independent of the classical pathway. Consistent with the second possibility, the NBD inhibitor had minimal effect on Id1-mediated activation of NF-κB in the absence of TCR signaling. The exact nature of such a mechanism remains to be elucidated. Id1 Expression Induces Overproduction of TNFα and IFNγ—In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of Id1 on T cell development, we performed microarray analysis to compare gene expression profiles between DP thymocytes from wild-type and Id1 transgenic mice and obtained two major groups of genes regulated by IFNγ and TNFα. 3Y. Yang and X.-H. Sun, unpublished data. For example, IRF-1, IRF-7, ISGF3, ICSBP, STAT1 MX2, MyD88, and SOCS-3 are known to be regulated by IFNγ and/or TNFα (31Chawla-Sarkar M. Lindner D.J. Liu Y.F. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Silverman R.H. Borden E.C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 32Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). This result led us to suspect that Id1 expression might cause overproduction of IFNγ and TNFα in the thymus. To test this hypothesis, we performed real-time PCR assays using Ficoll-purified thymocytes from wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous Id1 transgenic mice. When compared with wild-type thymocytes, mRNA levels of both IFNγ and TNFα were increased in heterozygous Id1 transgenic mice but more dramatically in homozygous transgenic mice, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of Id1 expression (Fig. 4A). Alternatively, the different levels of cytokine production may be explained by a difference in the proportion of various cell populations present in heterozygous or homozygous transgenic thymuses, which may be different in their ability to produce these cytokines. We next sorted CD4+CD8+ thymocytes from wild-type and heterozygous Id1 transgenic mice and found that levels of both IFNγ and TNFα mRNA were elevated in the latter (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that Id1 expression in thymocytes intrinsically causes up-regulation of IFNγ and TNFα. However, it is possible that other types of cells in the thymus may secondarily contribute to the overall production of IFNγ and TNFα because more dramatic differences were observed in total thymocytes. To further test the direct stimulating effect of Id1 on TNFα and IFNγ production, we analyzed the transcript levels of the two cytokines in Id1-expressing 16610D9 cells. Cells were transduced with vector- or Id1-expressing retroviruses and stimulated with anti-CD3 plus or minus anti-CD28 antibodies. Transduced cells were then separated from non-transduced cells based on EGFP expression produced from the retrovectors. Real-time PCR analyses were performed using total RNA isolated from EGFP-positive and -negative cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Stimulation with anti-CD3 and especially with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies increased TNFα and IFNγ expression in vector-transduced cells or non-transduced cells. However, the same treatments resulted in much more dramatic increases in the production of both cytokines in Id1-expressing cells. Interestingly, non-transduced cells co-cultured with Id1-transduced cells did not exhibit such dramatic increases in TNFα and IFNγ production, suggesting that the synergistic stimulatory effects by TCR signaling and Id1 expression are intrinsic to Id1-expressing cells. IFNγ and TNFα secreted by Id1-expressing cells had minimal effects on their neighboring non-transduced cells. Id1 Enhances TNFα and IFNγ Expression through c-Rel Activation—Since expression of TNFα and IFNγ is known to involve regulation by NF-κB (2Karin M. Greten F.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar, 5Sica A. Dorman L. Viggiano V. Cippitelli M. Ghosh P. Rice N. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30412-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), we tested whether the effect of Id1 on TNFα and IFNγ expression is due to the ability of Id1 to potentiate TCR-stimulated NF-κB activation. Because we found that Id1 expression led to a marked activation of c-Rel upon TCR signaling, we examined TNFα and IFNγ expression in c-Rel-deficient thymocytes. Total thymocytes were isolated from wild-type or c-Rel-deficient mice and transduced with Id1-expressing or control retroviruses. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were stimulated with antibodies against CD3 and CD28. Transduced cells were then sorted for EGFP expression, and they displayed a CD4+CD8+ phenotype. TNFα and IFNγ mRNA levels were measured using real-time PCR. TCR signaling stimulated TNFα expression in wild-type cells transduced with vector viruses, but Id1 expression greatly enhanced this stimulation (Fig. 6A). However, the effects of both TCR signaling and Id1 expression were nearly abolished in c-Rel-deficient cells, suggesting that c-Rel plays an important role in Id1-potentiated and TCR-stimulated expression of TNFα. In addition, c-Rel also contributed to basal levels of TNFα expression because lack of c-Rel led to reduction of TNFα expression in both vector- and Id1-transduced cells in the absence of TCR signaling (Fig. 6A). Interferon-γ expression was also stimulated by TCR signaling and further potentiated by Id1 expression. Loss of c-Rel also diminished these effects (Fig. 6B). However, c-Rel appeared to partially contribute to the effect of Id1 in the presence of TCR stimulation because a modest reduction in interferon-γ expression was observed in c-Rel-deficient mice. Whether the residual level of expression is due to the function of other NF-κB family members or other unrelated transcription factors remains to be determined. Our previous analyses of Id1 transgenic mice, in which Id1 is expressed under the control of lck promoter, revealed aberrant NF-κB activation in total thymocytes, which contributed to the T cell defects seen in these mice (25Kim D. Xu M. Nie L. Peng X.C. Jimi E. Voll R.E. Nguyen T. Ghosh S. Sun X.H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 9-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether NF-κB activation was a direct consequence of Id1 expression or a secondary effect resulting from abnormal thymic environment. For example, inappropriate levels of cytokines in Id1 transgenic thymuses could lead to aberrant activation of NF-κB. Here, we demonstrate the intrinsic effect of Id1 expression on NF-κB activation using a cell culture system. Although TNFα can stimulate NF-κB activation, TNFα expression occurs downstream of Id1 expression and TCR signaling, which lead to NF-κB super-activation. Furthermore, our results indicate that cells co-cultured with Id1-expressing cells fail to produce TNFα at the level found in Id1-expressing cells, thus ruling out an extrinsic effect of TNFα on NF-κB activation (Fig. 5A). Id1 expression acts synergistically with TCR stimulation to activate NF-κB in 16610D9 cells, which is reminiscent of the situation in the thymus where developing thymocytes receive signals from antigen-presenting cells through their TCR. The effect of Id1 expression, at least in part, involves the classical pathway of NF-κB activation through the interaction between NEMO and IKKβ, which is known to be responsible for TCR-mediated NF-κB activation (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar, 10Weil R. Israel A. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that IKKβ phosphorylation is rapidly and dramatically increased in Id1-expressing cells upon anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation. However, part of the activating effect of Id1 appeared to be NEMO-independent, especially in the absence of TCR signaling. The inhibitor, which interferes with NEMO and IKKβ interaction, had minimal effects on the basal level of Id1-induced NF-κB activation as indicated by the luciferase activity produced by a NF-κB reporter gene. In contrast, IκBα super repressor almost completely diminishes NF-κB reporter activity. Taken together, these data suggest that Id1 not only potentiates NF-κB activation through the classic pathway initiated by TCR signaling but also causes NF-κB activation through an unknown alternative pathway. This phenomenon was not only observed in the 16610D9 cell line but also in CD4+ thymocytes of Id1 transgenic mice (26Qi Z. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 7313-7323Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of this pathway and its interaction with the classical pathway remains to be elucidated. The mechanism by which Id1 expression, likely through inhibiting E protein functions, influences these NF-κB activating pathways is an interesting issue to be addressed. Because E proteins are transcription factors, it is possible that these proteins activate transcription of genes encoding proteins normally involved in suppressing NF-κB activation. However, such genes have not been identified, but their products likely act upstream of IKKβ complexes (Fig. 3). Id1 expression also enhances signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediated by Erk and p38.3 Therefore, it is not clear whether regulation of IKK and mitogen-activated protein kinases involves similar mechanisms or separate events. Interestingly, Id1 expression also causes NF-κB activation in a prostate cancer cell line (33Ling M.T. Wang X. Ouyang X.S. Xu K. Tsao S.W. Wong Y.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4498-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Whether a similar molecular mechanism is involved in different cell types also remains to be determined. c-Rel is the member of the NF-κB family primarily affected by Id1 during TCR signaling in 16610D9 cells. This is consistent with our previous finding in Id1 transgenic thymocytes. The role of c-Rel in Id1-potentiated and TCR-mediated activation of NF-κB was further demonstrated by the reduction of TNFα and IFNγ expression in c-rel-deficient thymocytes. Interestingly, c-Rel is known to be preferentially expressed in lymphoid cells, and its expression is auto-regulated by NF-κB (6Liou H.C. Hsia C.Y. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 767-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether initial activation of NF-κB lead to up-regulation of c-Rel gene expression or Id1 expression directly causes selective activation of c-Rel. NF-κB hyperactivation has been attributed to the developmental defect found in Id1 transgenic mice (25Kim D. Xu M. Nie L. Peng X.C. Jimi E. Voll R.E. Nguyen T. Ghosh S. Sun X.H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 9-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Qi Z. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 7313-7323Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since NF-κB transcription factors control the expression of a large number of genes, it is difficult to pinpoint a single specific factor responsible for the developmental defect. Indeed, although expression of IFNγ and TNFα has been shown to be stimulated by Id1 via NF-κB activities, disruption of receptors for these two cytokines could not significantly rescue T cell development.3 This may be due to multiple defects caused by Id1 expression or even by NF-κB hyperactivation. However, the finding that Id1 expression influences IFNγ and TNFα expression has biological implications beyond the T cell lineage. For example, Id1 is found to be expressed at relatively high levels in macrophages, 4S. Cochrane and X.-H. Sun, unpublished results. and IFNγ and TNFα are cytokines produced or utilized by these cells (34Leon M.L. Zuckerman S.H. Inflamm. Res. 2005; 54: 395-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35Yoshimura A. Cancer Sci. 2006; 97: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Whether Id1 plays a physiological role in IFNγ and TNFα expression in macrophages, especially in activated macrophages, is an interesting subject awaiting investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2014417202,"Huntington disease (HD) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a polyglutamine (poly(Q) tract in the N-terminal region of huntingtin (htt). Although the precise mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in HD have not been fully elucidated, transcriptional dysregulation has been implicated in disease pathogenesis. In HD, multiple N-terminal mutant htt fragments smaller than the first 500 amino acids have been found to accumulate in the nucleus and adversely affect gene transcription. It is unknown whether different htt fragments in the nucleus can differentially bind transcription factors and affect transcription. Here, we report that shorter N-terminal htt fragments, which are more prone to misfolding and aggregation, are more competent to bind Sp1 and inhibit its activity. These effects can be reversed by Hsp40, a molecular chaperone that reduces the misfolding of mutant htt. Our results provide insight into the beneficial effects of molecular chaperones and suggest that context dependent transcriptional dysregulation may contribute to differential toxicity of various N-terminal htt fragments.

Proteolytic cleavage of full-length htt, which is predominantly cytoplasmic, generates N-terminal htt fragments that accumulate abnormally and form inclusions over time in neuronal nuclei (1DiFiglia M.

The nucleus is thought to be a primary site of poly(Q) toxicity, as blocking the nuclear entry of htt suppresses its ability to cause cell death (2Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), conistent with the notion that cleavage of mutant htt is a key event in HD pathology (19Graham R.K. Deng Y. Slow E.J.

Because htt protein length can influence its cellular toxicity and ability to cause neurodegeneration in HD cellular models and transgenic mice (21Hackam A.S. Singaraja R. Wellington C.L. Metzler M.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is important to know whether nuclear N-terminal htt fragments of different length can differentially affect gene transcription. Understanding this issue will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the context-dependent neuropathology observed in various HD mouse models. In this study, we examined the interaction between mutant htt and the transcription factor Sp1. We demonstrate that this interaction is affected by htt protein context and further show that the ability of different N-terminal htt fragments to affect the activity of an Sp1-dependent promoter is context-dependent. In each case, shorter htt fragments, which are more likely to become misfolded, produced the greater inhibitory effect. The ability of these htt fragments to bind Sp1 and to reduce its activity was decreased by Hsp40 expression, suggesting that protein misfolding plays a key role in this process. Plasmids—cDNA constructs encoding exon-1 htt (1-67 amino acids) plus different glutamine (Q) repeats in the pRK5 eukaryotic expression vector were generated in our previous study (23Li S.H. Lam S. Cheng A.L. Li X.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2859-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 72Q repeat encoded stably by CAA/CAG mixture repeats (24Michalik A. Kazantsev A. Van Broeckhoven C. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (254): 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was introduced into our previous htt constructs (25Cornett J. Cao F. Wang C.E. Ross C.A. Bates G.P. Li S.H. Li X.J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) to produce N-terminal mutant htt (1-212 or 1-508 amino acids) with an expanded poly(Q) domain (72Q-212 and 72Q-508). The NLS of the SV large T antigen (PKKKRKV) was linked to the N terminus of these htt proteins to generate NLS-72Q-67, NLS-72Q-212, and NLS-72Q-508. The nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) promoter from the luciferase reporter construct (11Sipione S. Rigamonti D. Valenza M. Zuccato C. Conti L. Pritchard J. Kooperberg C. Olson J.M. Cattaneo E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1953-1965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was placed into the multiple cloning site of pDsRed-Express-1 vector (Clontech) to generate the NGFR-DsRed reporter construct. Full-length human Hsp40 in the pRK-hemagglutinin vector, which contains a C-terminal hemagglutinin epitope, was generated in our previous study (26Zhou H. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48417-48424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The rabbit polyclonal antibody (EM48) and mouse monoclonal antibody (mEM48) to htt were generated using the first 256 amino acids of human htt as described previously (18Zhou H. Cao F.

For Sp1 immunoprecipitation, we used rabbit antibodies to Sp1 (S9809, Sigma) and (sc-59, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mouse antibody to the hemagglutinin epitope (12CA5, Cell Signaling) was used to detect transfected Hsp40. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. NIH 3T3 and Sp1-/- cells, both of which were derived from mouse fibroblasts, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. cDNAs were transfected into 70-80% confluent HEK293T, NIH 3T3, and Sp1-/- cells for 24-48 h using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiencies for NIH 3T3 and Sp1-/- cells were equal as determined by visualization of transfected red fluorescent protein. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation of endogenous Sp1 from cultured cells, HEK293T cells in a 6-well plate were transfected with 1 μg/well htt cDNA for 24 h using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were collected and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (×1,000; P8340, Sigma)) at 4 °C on a rocking platform for 30 min. The lysates were spun at 500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was precleared with 50% Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) slurry on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (500 μl at 1 μg/μl) was then subjected to immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of rabbit anti-Sp1 (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Rabbit preimmune serum served as the control for Sp1 immunoprecipitations. Fifteen μl of 50% Protein A-Sepharose slurry was added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 30 s and washed 3 times in lysis buffer. The beads containing immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with mEM48 and anti-Sp1. For immunoprecipitation of Sp1 from HD mouse brains, we used R6/2 (28Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P.

Tallaksen-Greene S. Chien W.M. Cearley J.A. Jackson W.S. Crouse A.B. Ren S. Li X.J. Albin R.L. Detloff P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) mice. These mice were maintained at the Emory Animal Facility as described previously (18Zhou H. Cao F. Wang Z. Yu Z.X. Nguyen H.P. Evans J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Yu Z.X. Li S.H. Evans J. Pillarisetti A. Li H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation from brain lysates of HD mice was done as follows. Mouse brain cortex was homogenized in buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (×1,000; P8340, Sigma)). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. This crude P1 pellet was suspended and vortexed in RIPA buffer before being centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (1 μg/μl of 300 μl) was then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Sp1 as described above. Immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with anti-Sp1 and mEM48 or 1C2. Immunocytochemistry—Immunostaining of cultured cells was done as described previously (12Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Zhou H. Lam S. Rao M. Li H. Li X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 12-well plates at ∼70-80% confluency and transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA/well for 24-48 h. At the end of the transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibody in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. After 3 washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with either fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and Hoechst dye (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed 3 times for 10 min each with PBS. A Zeiss fluorescent microscope (Axiovert S100) and a 3CCD camera video system (Dage-MTI Inc.) were used to capture images with different optical filters. The captured images were stored and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed using polyacrylamide Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked at room temperature for 1 h with 5% milk in PBS. Membranes were washed 3 times (10 min/each time) in PBS and incubated with primary antibodies in PBS and 3% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were again washed 3 times (10 min/each time) in PBS, blocked at room temperature for 1 h with 5% milk in PBS, and incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL plus chemiluminescence kits (Amersham Biosciences). Transcription Reporter Assays—To examine the effect of different fragments of intranuclear htt on the NGFR promoter, we transfected 70-80% confluent HEK293T cells in a 12-well plate for 48 h with pRK vector, NLS-72Q-67, NLS-72Q-212, or NLS-72Q-508 (1 μg/well) and NGFR-DsRed reporter constructs (0.33 μg/well). After transfection for 48 h, cells were scraped from the plate and suspended in sterile 1× PBS (500 μl/well). A total volume of 100 μl (50 μl of the cell suspension and 50 μl of 1× PBS) was aliquoted in duplicate into a black polystyrene 96-well assay plate (Corning Inc.). Relative fluorescent units were measured with a fluorescence plate reader (Fluostar Galaxy, BMG Labtechnologies) set at 544 nm excitation and 590 nm emission. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test when comparing two groups or using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison post-test when comparing three or more groups. Statistical significance was considered to be p < 0.05. Western blot analysis of transfected HEK293T cells with mEM48 was also performed to verify the expression of transfected htt. Generation and Expression of N-terminal Htt Constructs—To study whether protein length can alter the ability of htt to affect gene transcription, we used three N-terminal htt constructs encoding exon-1 htt (72Q-67), htt amino acids 1-212 (72Q-212), or 1-508 (72Q-508) with a 72Q repeat. These proteins cover the range of N-terminal htt fragments that can accumulate in the nucleus in brains from HD repeat knock-in mice (18Zhou H. Cao F. Wang Z. Yu Z.X. Nguyen H.P. Evans J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because transient transfection leads to the cytoplasmic localization of the majority of transfected htt in cultured cells, we added the SV40 NLS to the N terminus of each htt fragment to ensure its nuclear localization (Fig. 1A). In this way, any differences in the effects of the N-terminal htt fragments (NLS-72Q-67, NLS-72Q-212, and NLS-72Q-508) in the nucleus are likely due to their protein context. Western blot analysis of transfected htt revealed the expected molecular weight and equal expression of these htt fragments (Fig. 1B), and nuclear localization of each htt fragment was confirmed by immunostaining (Fig. 1C). Sp1 Preferentially Associates with Shorter N-terminal Htt fragments Both in Vitro and in Vivo—Htt has been shown to interact with the transcriptional activator Sp1, and this interaction is enhanced by poly(Q) expansion (12Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Zhou H. Lam S. Rao M. Li H. Li X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). However, the effect of htt protein length on its binding to Sp1 has not been examined. We used immunoprecipitation to evaluate the interactions of different htt fragments with Sp1 in cells. We have found that aggregated htt can be co-precipitated with Hsp70 but not Sp1 (12Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Zhou H. Lam S. Rao M. Li H. Li X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 25Cornett J. Cao F. Wang C.E. Ross C.A. Bates G.P. Li S.H. Li X.J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused on the interaction of soluble mutant htt with Sp1. We transfected HEK293T cells with NLS-72Q-67, NLS-72Q-212, or NLS-72Q-508, immunoprecipitated endogenous Sp1, and examined the precipitates by Western blotting with mEM48 and anti-Sp1 (Fig. 2). Whereas the expression levels of these htt fragments are equivalent, a greater amount of shorter N-terminal fragments of htt were precipitated with Sp1 than longer fragments. Among the three N-terminal htt fragments tested, the shortest one (NLS-72Q-67) bound Sp1 the most. Although NLS-72Q-67 also formed aggregates that remained in the stacking gel (Fig. 2), only the soluble form of this protein was precipitated with Sp1. This result is consistent with previous reports (12Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Zhou H. Lam S. Rao M. Li H. Li X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Dunah A.W.

Nguyen H.P. Li X.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that soluble but not aggregated mutant htt associates with Sp1. Taken together, protein context regulates the ability of soluble htt to interact with Sp1. To test if the context-dependent interaction of N-terminal htt with Sp1 in transfected cells also occurs in HD mouse brain, we examined three different HD mouse models that express N-terminal or full-length mutant htt. In brain cortex from 4-week-old R6/2 mice that express human exon-1 htt (1-67 amino acids) with a 150Q repeat (28Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar), both soluble and aggregated htt were detected in nuclear fractions. Another soluble band at ∼125 kDa was also detected and may reflect a misfolded or oligomeric species of htt. Both soluble species of htt were precipitated with Sp1 but htt aggregates were not (Fig. 3A). We next examined 8-week-old N171-82Q HD transgenic mice that express the first 171 amino acids of human htt with an 82Q repeat (29Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A.

The transgenic htt was also precipitated with Sp1 (Fig. 3B). It is difficult to compare the amounts of precipitated htt from R6/2 and N171-82Q transgenic mice because of different transgene expression levels. Thus, we focused on HD knock-in mice that express full-length htt with 150Q from the endogenous mouse locus (17Lin C.H. Tallaksen-Greene S. Chien W.M. Cearley J.A. Jackson W.S. Crouse A.B. Ren S. Li X.J. Albin R.L. Detloff P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and can accumulate degraded N-terminal htt fragments over time (18Zhou H. Cao F. Wang Z. Yu Z.X. Nguyen H.P. Evans J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We used the crude P1 fraction from the cortex of HD knock-in mice at 2-12 months of age and performed Western blotting with 1C2, as it can sensitively detect N-terminal fragments of mutant htt in HD knock-in mouse brain. This crude fraction contains nuclear proteins and full-length htt as well as N-terminal htt fragments, allowing us to examine whether full-length or N-terminal htt preferentially interact with transcription factors in the brain. We then immunoprecipitated endogenous Sp1 and examined the precipitates by Western blotting with 1C2. N-terminal htt fragments are not as abundant as full-length htt in the input for immunoprecipitation, perhaps because they are unstable or become aggregates soon after degradation of full-length mutant htt. However, N-terminal htt fragments are clearly preferentially co-precipitated with Sp1 as compared with full-length htt. More importantly, Sp1 binding to N-terminal htt fragments, but not full-length htt, increased with age (Fig. 3C). Because HD repeat knock-in mice show age-dependent behavioral phenotypes (17Lin C.H. Tallaksen-Greene S. Chien W.M. Cearley J.A. Jackson W.S. Crouse A.B. Ren S. Li X.J. Albin R.L. Detloff P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), the age-dependent increase in the association of Sp1 with N-terminal htt fragments is likely to contribute to transcriptional dysregulation and neurological symptoms in this HD mouse model. Shorter N-terminal Htt Fragments Are More Competent to Suppress Sp1 Activity—We next wanted to determine whether the context-dependent interactions of htt with Sp1 are related to changes in Sp1-mediated gene expression. Like many other Sp1-dependent promoters, the p75 NGFR promoter lacks TATA and CAAT elements and is GC-rich. The activity of the NGFR promoter is dependent on Sp1 (31Poukka H. Kallio P.J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and inhibited by mutant htt (9Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Li H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5159-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Zhou H. Lam S. Rao M. Li H. Li X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus, we used the NGFR promoter as a tool to examine the effect of different htt fragments on Sp1-mediated transcription. To do so, we used the NGFR promoter to drive a DsRed reporter so that red fluorescence intensity can be used to quantify the activity of the NGFR promoter (Fig. 4A). We cotransfected HEK293T cells with NGFR-DsRed and Sp1 or PRK vector. Cotransfection of Sp1 increased DsRed reporter expression ∼10-fold as compared with the vector control (Fig. 4B). To ensure that this reporter activity is indeed dependent on Sp1, we also examined Sp1-/- mouse fibroblast cells (32Ping D. Boekhoudt G. Zhang F. Morris A. Philipsen S. Warren S.T. Boss J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1708-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the absence of Sp1, DsRed expression was reduced to background levels. By contrast, DsRed expression was readily detected in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells (Sp1+/+) in which the normal Sp1 level is present (Fig. 4B). Thus, the NGFR-DsRed reporter construct is a good tool to examine Sp1-dependent gene transcription. Next, we transfected HEK293T cells with NGFR-DsRed and NLS-72Q-67, NLS-72Q-212, or NLS-72Q-508 to examine if htt protein length is important for its ability to affect Sp1 activity. All three htt constructs decreased DsRed expression but NLS-72Q-67 had the strongest inhibitory effect (Fig. 4C). Because Western blots showed that the htt fragments were expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 4D), these results support the idea that the protein context of htt influences the ability of N-terminal htt fragments to decrease Sp1-mediated gene expression. Protein Misfolding Is Important for the Context-dependent Effects of N-terminal Htt on Sp1—One possible explanation for the stronger effect of shorter N-terminal htt fragments on Sp1 activity is that protein misfolding plays a role in this process. Shorter htt fragments are more likely to become misfolded or aggregated (21Hackam A.S. Singaraja R. Wellington C.L. Metzler M. McCutcheon K. Zhang T. Kalchman M. Hayden M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 27Gutekunst C.A. Li S.H. Yi H. Mulroy J.S. Kuemmerle S. Jones R. Rye D. Ferrante R.J. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2522-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as evidenced by the inverse correlation between protein length and aggregation for NLS-72Q-67, NLS-72Q-212, and NLS-72Q-508 (Fig. 4D). In the cell, proper protein folding is maintained by molecular chaperones, whereas clearance of misfolded proteins is mediated by the ubiquitinproteasome system (33Ciechanover A. Brundin P. Neuron. 2003; 40: 427-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 34Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M.

It is also likely that the nuclear environment is more favorable for mutant htt to become misfolded, as both chaperone (36Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and proteasome (18Zhou H. Cao F. Wang Z. Yu Z.X. Nguyen H.P. Evans J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) activities have been reported to be lower in the nucleus than the cytoplasm. To test this idea, we focused on exon-1 htt because of its propensity to misfold and aggregate. We transfected HEK293 cells with exon-1 htt containing either a 20Q (20Q-67) or 120Q (120Q-67) repeat and visualized transfected htt by immunocytochemistry using two antibodies. The first antibody (EM48) recognizes both soluble and aggregated htt (27Gutekunst C.A. Li S.H. Yi H. Mulroy J.S. Kuemmerle S. Jones R. Rye D. Ferrante R.J. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2522-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the second antibody (1C2) is specific to poly(Q) domains and does not recognize aggregated forms of mutant htt (18Zhou H. Cao F. Wang Z. Yu Z.X. Nguyen H.P. Evans J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37Lunkes A. Lindenberg K.S. Ben-Haiem L. Weber C. Devys D. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Mandel J.L. Trottier Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 259-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Both 20Q-67 and 120Q-67 were localized to the cytoplasm but 120Q-67 also formed aggregates that were intensely labeled by EM48. As expected, 1C2 antibody labeled soluble 120Q-67 but not aggregates (Fig. 5). 1C2 also weakly labeled 20Q-67 because it has a shorter poly(Q) stretch. To visualize mutant htt in the nucleus, we used NLS-72Q-67 for transfection. NLS-72Q-67 was distributed mostly in the nucleus, and its diffuse nuclear localization was clearly revealed by EM48 staining. However, 1C2 did not recognize soluble mutant htt in the nucleus, although it was able to label diffuse mutant htt in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). We have shown that HEK293 cells cotransfected with mutant htt and Hsp40 express both proteins and that Hsp40 can reduce poly(Q) aggregation (26Zhou H. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48417-48424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Even in the cells transfected with both NLS-72Q-67 and Hsp40, 1C2 still primarily labeled the cytoplasmic htt despite the intense nuclear staining of mutant htt by EM48 (Fig. 5B). Because Western blots show 1C2 immunoreactive bands of soluble mutant htt in the nucleus (Fig. 3 and Ref. 18Zhou H. Cao F. Wang Z. Yu Z.X. Nguyen H.P. Evans J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), these results support the idea that mutant htt in the nucleus possesses a conformation that prevents 1C2 immunoreaction in immunocytochemistry. If misfolding of nuclear htt contributes to its effect on Sp1, factors that reduce htt misfolding might also decrease its ability to interact with Sp1 and suppress Sp1 activity. To test this idea, we used the molecular chaperone Hsp40, which can effectively suppress htt misfolding and aggregation (25Cornett J. Cao F. Wang C.E. Ross C.A. Bates G.P. Li S.H. Li X.J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Zhou H. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48417-48424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Western blots confirmed the expression of NLS-72Q-67 and reduction in htt aggregation by Hsp40 transfection (Fig. 6A). Importantly, transfected Hsp40 decreased the amount of soluble htt precipitated with Sp1 (Fig. 6A). We then examined the effect of Hsp40 on the activity of NGFR-DsRed in htt-transfected HEK293T cells. Compared with the control htt (NLS-20Q-67) transfection, mutant htt (NLS-72Q-67) inhibited the transcriptional activity of the NGFR promoter. However, Hsp40 expression reversed this inhibition (Fig 6B). In the absence of NLS-72Q-67, Hsp40 expression had no significant effect on the NGFR promoter as compared with vector expression alone (Fig. 6C), suggesting that Hsp40 selectively reduces mutant htt-mediated impairment on Sp1-dependent gene transcription. Taken together, htt misfolding is important for its ability to interact with Sp1 and reduce Sp1 activity at specific promoters. Factors that prevent htt misfolding can therefore restore normal Sp1 function. In the present study, we show that Sp1 interacts with multiple N-terminal fragments of htt in the nucleus in both transfected cells and HD mouse brain. Importantly, these interactions are regulated by htt protein context. Shorter htt fragments bound more Sp1 than longer fragments and also suppressed the transcriptional activity from the NGFR promoter, which is known to be regulated by Sp1 (31Poukka H. Kallio P.J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, consistent with previous microarray studies showing that increased htt length reduces the number of poly(Q)-induced gene changes in HD mice (38Chan E.Y. Luthi-Carter R. Strand A. Solano S.M. Hanson S.A. DeJohn M.M. Kooperberg C. Chase K.O. DiFiglia M. Young A.B. Leavitt B.R. Cha J.H. Aronin N. Hayden M.R. Olson J.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), analysis of Sp1 and its transcriptional activity in our studies suggests that smaller N-terminal htt fragments may have a stronger effect on transcriptional activity than larger htt fragments. The context-dependent effect of mutant htt on transcription factors may contribute to different neurological symptoms seen in HD mice expressing different forms of mutant htt. Finally, htt misfolding appears to underlie its ability to bind Sp1 and reduce Sp1-dependent activity of the NGFR promoter and Hsp40, which prevents htt misfolding, deters this process. This observation provides further insight into the protective effects of molecular chaperones in HD (39Sakahira H. Breuer P. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 4: 16412-16418Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, chaperones are also found to reduce the interaction of exon-1 mutant htt with TATA box-binding protein (16Schaffar G. Breuer P. Boteva R. Behrends C. Tzvetkov N. Strippel N. Sakahira H. Siegers K. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The findings in the present study suggest a model in which small htt fragments, after entering the nucleus, undergo a conformational change, interact with Sp1, and directly disrupt Sp1 function in gene expression. In HD repeat knock-in mice that show an age-dependent increase in accumulation of mutant N-terminal htt fragments and their formation of nuclear aggregates (17Lin C.H. Tallaksen-Greene S. Chien W.M. Cearley J.A. Jackson W.S. Crouse A.B. Ren S. Li X.J. Albin R.L. Detloff P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 18Zhou H. Cao F. Wang Z. Yu Z.X. Nguyen H.P. Evans J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the association of N-terminal fragments of mutant htt with Sp1 in the brain is also increased with age (Fig. 3C). Moreover, reduction of the expression of some Sp1-mediated genes has been reported to become more severe over time in HD mouse models (40Luthi-Carter R. Strand A. Peters N.L. Solano S.M. Hollingsworth Z.R. Menon A.S. Frey A.S. Spektor B.S. Penney E.B. Schilling G. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Tapscott S.J. Young A.B. Cha J.H. Olson J.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1259-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Because only soluble mutant htt binds Sp1, shorter htt fragments may bind Sp1 and prevent Sp1 binding to promoter DNA before they form aggregates. It should be noted that Sp1 mediates the expression of a large number of genes and is reported to be up-regulated in some models of HD (13Chen-Plotkin A.S. Sadri-Vakili G. Yohrling G.J. Braveman M.W. Benn C.L. Glajch K.E. Dirocco D.P. Farrell L.A. Krainc D. Gines S. Macdonald M.E. Cha J.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 41Qiu Z. Norflus F.

Kubilis J. Ferrante R.J. Ross B.D. Neve R. Ratan R.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3597-3606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant htt probably causes oxidative stress to increase Sp1 levels, which may also activate some genes that can trigger cellular pathological pathways under certain conditions. However, growing evidence has shown that mutant htt inhibits the binding of Sp1 to DNA promoters and suppresses the transcription of certain Sp1-mediated genes (12Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Zhou H. Lam S.

Cell. 2005; 123: 1241-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our data further demonstrate that this inhibitory effect is context-dependent. Because mutant htt aberrantly interacts with multiple transcription factors (6Li S.H. Li X.J. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 146-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), it is possible that these interactions are also context-dependent and that protein context and conformation are key aspects of suppression of selective transcription factors by mutant htt. Likewise, context-dependent inhibition of transcription could contribute to the selective or specific neuropathology in HD.

https://openalex.org/W2029486013,"RasGRP3 is an exchange factor for Ras-like small GTPases that is activated in response to the second messenger diacylglycerol. As with other diacylglycerol receptors, RasGRP3 is redistributed upon diacylglycerol or phorbol ester binding. Several factors are important in determining the pattern of translocation, including the potency of the diacylglycerol analog, the affinity of the receptor for phospholipids, and in some cases, protein-protein interactions. However, little is known about the mechanisms that play a role in RasGRP3 redistribution aside from the nature of the ligand. To discover potential protein binding partners for RasGRP3, we screened a human brain cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid approach. We identified dynein light chain 1 as a novel RasGRP3-interacting protein. The interaction was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo and required the C-terminal domain encompassing the last 127 amino acids of RasGRP3. A truncated mutant form of RasGRP3 that lacked this C-terminal domain was unable to interact with dynein light chain 1 and displayed a dramatically altered subcellular localization, with a strong reticular distribution and perinuclear and nuclear localization. These findings suggest that dynein light chain 1 represents a novel anchoring protein for RasGRP3 that may regulate subcellular localization of the exchange factor and, as such, may participate in the signaling mediated by diacylglycerol through RasGRP3."
https://openalex.org/W2109728964,"A polymorphic glucocorticoid receptor (GR(Qn)) with an expanded CAG track and two silent mutations, when compared with the sequence of other isoform (GR(wt)), is found in two outbred mouse lines that were produced by selection for high (SH) or low (SL) stress response from high or low heat loss lines of mice, respectively. The GR(Qn) allele, which is also found in 5 of 16 commonly used inbred mouse lines, had a much higher frequency in SL mice; the GR(wt/wt) was found only in the SH line. Both GR(Qn/Qn) and GR(wt/Qn) mice had a much weaker corticosterone response to stress than the GR(wt/wt) mice. Assessment of open field activity revealed that GR(Qn/Qn) and GR(wt/Qn) mice exhibited significantly lower velocity and locomotor activity, less time in the center, and much longer duration in corner zones than the GR(wt/wt) mice. The increased anxiety-type behaviors of the GR(Qn/Qn) and GR(wt/Qn) mice were confirmed by the ""elevated plus maze"" test in which GR(Qn/Qn) and GR(wt/Qn) mice spent significantly less time in the ""open arm"" and longer duration in the ""closed arm,"" than GR(wt/wt) mice. These results suggest this GR polymorphism plays a role in complex mechanisms leading to lower corticosterone response to stress, and may also be associated with decreased locomotive and increased anxiety-type behaviors in mice."

The functional anatomy and rattling of the tymbal organ in 17 yr periodical cicada, Magicicada cassini (Brood X), were revealed by high-resolution microcomputed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, electron microscopy, and laser vibrometry to understand the mechanism of sound production in these insects. Each 50 Hz muscle contraction yielded five to six stages of rib buckling in the tymbal, and a small release of muscle tension resulted in a rapid recovery due to the spring-loaded nature of the stiff ribs in the resilin-rich tymbal. The tymbal muscle sarcomeres have thick and thin filaments that are 30% shorter than those in flight muscles, with Z-bands that were thicker and configured into novel perforated hexagonal lattices. Caffeine-treated fibers supercontracted by allowing thick filaments to traverse the Z-band through its open lattice. This superfast sonic muscle illustrates design features, especially the matching hexagonal symmetry of the myofilaments and the perforated Z-band that contribute to high-speed contractions, long endurance, and potentially supercontraction needed for producing enduring mating songs and choruses."
https://openalex.org/W2015187293,"We have previously reported that both hypotonic stress (HTS) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induce ATP release and a transient reorganization of actin through sequential activation of RhoA/Rho-kinase and focal adhesion kinase F-actin (FAK)/paxillin in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). LPA is known to induce the activation of RhoA via its specific receptors, but the mechanisms by which HTS initiates these intracellular signals are not known. The present study aimed to identify the molecule(s) that are unique to the sensing and/or transducing the mechanical stress. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed the expression of several integrin subunits in HUVECs. Anti-integrin alpha5beta1 antibody (Ab), but not anti-integrin alpha2, alpha6, alpha v, or beta4 antibodies, inhibited HTS-induced RhoA translocation, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, ATP release, and actin reorganization. However, the LPA-induced ATP release and actin reorganization were not inhibited by any of these anti-integrin antibodies, indicating that integrin alpha5beta1 plays a pivotal role in the HTS-induced but not in the LPA-induced responses. It is therefore reasonable to assume that this particular subtype of integrin is involved in the initiation of the responses induced by mechanical stimuli in HUVECs."

For smooth and non-muscle myosins, filaments are stabilized by RLC phosphorylation, which is required for activation of the actin-activated ATPase activity. Myosin filaments can interact with actin and generate force, however, when dephosphorylated and inactivated, filaments can disassemble to form a mixture of filaments in equilibrium with a soluble hairpin folded monomer called 10 S (3Trybus K.M. Huiatt T.W. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6151-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The relative amount of each conformation is defined by the critical monomer concentration (4Ankrett R.J. Rowe A.J. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Bagshaw C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the myosin concentration at which filaments form. Many isoforms of myosin II can adopt the 10 S conformation, including those from vertebrate smooth muscle (3Trybus K.M. Huiatt T.W. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Of these isoforms it appears that the regulated myosins (smooth, non-muscle, and molluscan) form the 10 S conformation to the greatest extent. The physiological function of 10 S is unknown. It has been suggested that it may be an inactive compact form of myosin suitable for transport within the cell by other motors (20Faruqi A.R. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 332: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 22Trybus K.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 10 S has been detected in permeabilized embryonic, but not adult gizzard muscle (23Horowitz A. Trybus K.M. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that the stability of filaments may be tissue-specific. Other motors such as myosin I (24Stoffler H.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can form a self-inhibited folded structures similar to 10 S myosin II. Therefore, the ability to adopt such folded structures may be an evolutionarily conserved property of motor proteins. 10 S myosin was named after its sedimentation coefficient measured by analytical ultracentrifugation (S for Svedberg) (3Trybus K.M. Huiatt T.W. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6151-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 27Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol.

Electron micrographs of shadowed and negatively stained single molecules (3Trybus K.M. Huiatt T.W. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(Tokyo). 1983; 94: 1147-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) show that the heads are bent down toward the tail and that the tail is bent at least twice into three regions of approximately equal length. The first bend is at the S2-LMM junction, and the second bending region appears to interact with the regulatory domains. The location of the second bending region coincides with two closely spaced potential bends characterized by their low propensity for coiled-coil structure (31Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The tail-regulatory domain interaction is consistent with the fact that both the ELC and the RLC, and specifically the RLC N terminus are required for 10 S stability (32Ikebe M. Ikebe R. Kamisoyama H. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R. Matsuura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28173-28180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16485-16492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single-headed SMM can fold, but only at an unusually low ionic strength (31Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of both heads appears to strongly stabilize the interaction of the tail. Because both motor domains are required to adopt the off state (34Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it appears the tail binds to the heads in the off state (31Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is consistent with mutagenesis data showing that myosin hybrids that cannot adopt the off state are less stable in the 10 S conformation (32Ikebe M. Ikebe R. Kamisoyama H. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R. Matsuura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28173-28180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of the 10 S monomer is efficiently switched off. The products of ATP hydrolysis, ADP-Pi, are stably bound (trapped) at both of the 10 S active sites. Efficient active site trapping appears to be a unique property of 10 S. Neither 6 S monomers, in which the tail is extended, nor filaments can trap ADP-Pi to such an extent. Measurements of product release rates have shown that 6 S extended SMM turns over at ∼0.02 s-1 and filaments turn over at 0.006 s-1, whereas 10 S fold SMM turns over at ∼2-4 × 10-4 s-1 (35Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2887-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Cross R.A. Cross K.E. Sobieszek A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2637-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 10 S must transition back to the 6 S conformation before its bound ADP-Pi can be released. An important question is whether or not the tail interaction with the head is required for the trapped state. Covalent attachment of the tail to the C-lobe of the RLC is sufficient to keep that head's ATPase activity inhibited even at high ionic strength (31Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Turnover rates by product release for heavy meromyosin, which lacks the C-terminal two-thirds of the tail and cannot form 10 S, are about 10× the rate of 10 S (38Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15815-15819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, structural determinates of down-regulation are present in HMM, correlating with the heads-down attitude observed not only in HMM but also in 10 S (28Suzuki H. Stafford W.F.I. Slayter H.S. Seidel J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14810-14817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the transition in 10 S to the fully trapped state requires the interaction of the tail with the regulatory domain. Mutagenesis studies have addressed whether 10 S stability and inhibited ATPase activity are directly coupled. For most of the available mutants in the N-terminal (32Ikebe M. Ikebe R. Kamisoyama H. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R. Matsuura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28173-28180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and central hinge (40Ikebe M. Kambara T. Stafford W.F. Sata M. Katayama E. Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17702-17707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) region the inability to fold to the 10 S conformation is correlated to elevation of the actin-activated ATPase of the unphosphorylated state. Cryo-EM data show that dephosphorylated smooth HMM (41Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 42Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and 10 S (43Liu J. Wendt T. Taylor D. Taylor K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and myosin in a regulated thick filament (44Woodhead J.L. Zhao F.Q. Craig R. Egelman E.H. Alamo L. Padron R. Nature. 2005; 436: 1195-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), adopt a conformation in which both heads are bent toward the tail domain and in which the two motor domains interact. One head is in the pre-power stroke state, and the other is in the post-power stroke state. The motor-motor interaction has been proposed to be the mechanism for down-regulation in that one head cannot bind to actin, and the other head, although with an unhindered actin binding site, may have a hindered converter domain and thus exhibit slow product release. However, in solution, the actin affinity of 10 S is extremely weak suggesting that both heads are incapable of actin binding (31Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 45Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6177-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Considering this fact and that both heads trap ADP-Pi, it is possible that both heads of 10 S in solution are in the pre-power stroke state. We are interested in the structural mechanism for stabilization of the 10 S conformation and specifically, the mechanism for maintenance of the off state (38Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 46Cremo C.R. Wang F. Facemyer K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41465-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 48Wahlstrom J.L. Randall Jr., M.A. Lawson J.D. Lyons D.E. Siems W.F. Crouch G.J. Barr R. Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 5123-5131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). From the cryo-EM data mentioned above, it is not clear how the tail interacts with the regulatory domain. Previously we showed that a photocross-linker within the RLC C-lobe (Cys-108) cross-links to a region of LMM (C-terminal two-thirds of the tail) that coincides with the position of the second bending region. The tail was cross-linked to only one RLC, leaving the other uncross-linked. Clearly this RLC-tail interaction is significant, because it is sufficient to keep the head fully down-regulated even under high ionic strength conditions, which activated the partner head. However, other significant interactions may also have been stabilized. Here we attached a photocross-linker to the other RLC lobe (N-terminal) at S59C to determine whether the tail interacts with this lobe. After photo-activated cross-linking we find four types of molecules all of which are “locked” into the 10 S conformation: Molecule I in which both RLCs are cross-linked to one HC; Molecule II in which each RLC is cross-linked to an HC; Molecule III in which one RLC cross-linked to an HC and the other RLC remains uncross-linked; and Molecule IV in which one RLC is cross-linked to an HC and the other is internally cross-linked. Analysis of the sites of cross-linking by MALDI-MS confirmed that there are at least two regions of the tail, spaced ∼117 Å, that interact with S59C in 10 S SMM. Therefore, these data show that the tail interacts with both RLC at S59C within a single molecule. Protein Preparations—SMM was prepared from frozen chicken gizzards (49Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) obtained from Pell-Freeze. All experiments were performed with 100% unphosphorylated SMM. Human smooth muscle RLC (MLRN_HUMAN, accession P24844) mutants were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (34Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Native ELC was obtained from the supernatant of a 95% ethanol precipitation of purified SMM (50Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. Bioconj. Chem. 1992; 3: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the following extinction coefficients: SMM, ϵ0.1%280 = 0.56; RLC, ϵ0.1%277 = 0.337; BP-RLC, ϵ0.1%302 = 0.89 (31Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); and ELC, ϵ0.1%280 = 0.31. Cross-linking SMM into 10 S—Sample preparation and cross-linking methods were as previously reported (31Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and as in the figure legends. Briefly, recombinant thrombin-treated S59C RLC was labeled with BPIA (synthesized as described (31Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)), exchanged onto SMM using trifluoroperazine (51Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or heat (31Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the non-filamentous protein was irradiated in 10 S buffer conditions (31Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After centrifugation in a filament-promoting buffer to remove filaments, the protein in the supernatant was applied to a gel-filtration column. The protein eluting at the 10 S position under high salt conditions was collected (see Fig. 1B). Determination of the Composition of Gel-filtration Fractions—The structures and the approximate relative percentages of all the cross-linked molecules present in each fraction across the gel-filtration peak (Fig. 1B) were determined in five steps. First, gel band assignments were made using Rf values calculated from a molecular weight standard curve (see Blue Plus 2 (Invitrogen) plus the SMM HC). Second, stain densities were quantified (Lab Works software, Ultraviolet Products), and the values were normalized to the SMM standard (lane 1, Fig. 1A) to account for varying sample loads. All stain densities were verified to be in the linear range. Lane 2, Fig. 1B, was not analyzed due to the distortion of bands in the HC region. Third, we verified that the density lost from the RLC bands equaled the amount gained in the HC region, thus accounting for all material. Fourth, for the HC-RLC and RLC-HC-RLC bands, the fraction of each measured band density (Dband) that was attributed to RLC staining alone (X) was determined by Equations 1 and 2, respectively, where [DRLC/DHC]std = 0.16 = band density ratio for unmodified SMM. XRLC-HC=DRLC-HC×0.14(Eq. 1) XRLC-HC-RLC=DRLC-HC-RLC×0.24(Eq. 2) XRLC=DRLC(Eq. 3) XXL-RLC=DXL-RLC(Eq. 4) Yband=Xband∑14Xband×100(Eq. 5) This adjustment was not necessary for the uncross-linked and internally cross-linked RLC bands, because they do not contain HCs; so X = Dband; see Equations 3 and 4. Fifth, the X values for the four RLC-containing bands were converted to percentages Y using Equation 5. Therefore, Y represents the % distribution of the RLC among the four RLC containing bands. These values were used to estimate the relative amounts of the four cross-linked molecules present in each fraction as described under “Results” for Fig. 3. Proteolytic Digest of Photocross-linked 10 S—High-performance liquid chromatography-purified cross-linked 10 S SMM or unmodified SMM (1.5 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 125 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.5) were equilibrated (25 °C with stirring) prior to adding Glu-C (175 units per 100 mg of SMM; Sigma, EC 3.4.21.19, Type XVII-B). The reaction was quenched at 40 min by adding 2 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate (prepared in isopropanol) at 0 °C. Samples were stored at -80 °C. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and destained with 75 mm ammonium bicarbonate in 40% ethanol. The cross-linked LMM-RLC, unirradiated LMM, BP-S59C RLC, and blank gel bands were excised (see Fig. 4, lane 6), placed into microcentrifuge tubes and incubated with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 10 min. After removing the ammonium bicarbonate, the gel pieces were dehydrated by adding acetonitrile, followed by lyophilization with a vacuum centrifuge and rehydration with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The washing procedure was repeated once. Trypsin and Glu-C (1/10 (w/v) protease to substrate, sequencing grade from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, cat. no. 1047817) in 50 mm sodium phosphate with 1 mm CaCl2 were added to the dried gel pieces, and the mixture was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Two more protease additions were made to the gel pieces over a 16-h period. Excess buffer was removed, and peptides were extracted from the gel material by incubating for 60 min with rocking at room temperature in 150 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile. The supernatant was removed and replaced with extraction solution again. The supernatants were combined and lyophilized to dryness and submitted for MALDI-MS analysis. Proteolytic Digest of Internal RLC Cross-links—The internal RLC cross-link (Fig. 1B), unirradiated BP-S59C, native RLC, and blank gel bands were excised from the gel and placed into microcentrifuge tubes. Gel plugs were destained in 50% acetonitrile, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Liquid was removed, and 50 μl of acetonitrile was added for 5 min at room temperature prior to an additional wash. Liquid was removed and Glu-C digests (25 μl, 10 μg/ml in ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5) were performed at 37 °C for 16 h. The reaction was quenched with 15 μl of 0.3% formic acid. Peptides were extracted from the gel material as described above. Mass Spectral Analysis—Samples (pH adjusted to <4) were aspirated and dispensed with ZipTips (ZipTipBu-C18 PB TMP, Millipore) three times, and the bound peptides were eluted with 70% acetonitrile/0.2% formic acid containing 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Aldrich), then spotted onto the MALDI target. Mass spectra were obtained using an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer with TOF/TOF optics. The samples were run in positive reflector mode at laser power 5,100 or 2,500 scanning from 700 to 4,000 Da and accumulating 10,000 shots/spectra. Three internal standards (Sigma) were applied to the samples; angiotensin I, m/z 1296.68; adrenocorticotropic hormone fragments (clip 1-17), m/z 2093.087; and adrenocorticotropic hormone (clip 7-38), m/z 3657.929. Tandem MS spectra were recorded in positive-ion mode with a resolution of 50 (full-width at one-half maximum) and 2500 shots were collected. For collision-induced dissociation-MS/MS, the laser power was 5500, and the selected ions were fragmented using atmospheric gas in the collision cell and analyzed in the orthogonal TOF. Some spectra were taken without the gas, termed laser-induced dissociation-MS/MS at laser power 6500. Analysis of MALDI-TOF/TOF Data to Determine the Sites of Cross-linking—Precursor mass lists with signal to noise levels ≥ 20 were generated from MALDI-TOF/TOF experiments. To annotate the mass lists, data were submitted on-line for analysis by ASAP (Sandia Laboratories) (52Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). For each experiment, the appropriate criteria were entered as variables; tolerated error value was ±25 ppm, cross-linker mass was 237.086 Da, and methionine oxidation and protease specificity were used. For the RLC-LMM cross-link, the LMM sequence (MYH11_CHICK, accession P10587, residues 1150-1979) and the RLC sequence (MLRN_HUMAN, accession P24844 with N terminus extended with the sequence GSHM and Ser-59 mutated to Cys and Cys-108 mutated to Ala) were entered with an intervening nonsense KKKKK sequence. For the internal RLC cross-link, only the RLC sequence was entered. The benzophenone modification was restricted to S59C but was permitted to photo-insert into any residue either with or without the loss of water (48Wahlstrom J.L. Randall Jr., M.A. Lawson J.D. Lyons D.E. Siems W.F. Crouch G.J. Barr R. Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 5123-5131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ASAP output is an annotated list of possible assignments for all masses, including unmodified peptides and possible cross-linked peptides. The same procedure was repeated for the precursor mass list obtained from a gel blank sample and for a benzophenone-labeled but unirradiated S59C sample (or the unirradiated LMM for the LMM-RLC data). The mass lists, calculated for protease autolysis (determined by MassCutter, us.expasy.org) and human keratin contamination (accession AAA96689) were processed through ASAP, as for the irradiated sample. The latter ASAP outputs were then “subtracted” from the cross-linked sample output using a spreadsheet program (Excel). Because position 59 was labeled with BPIA, all masses attributed to any sequences lacking Ser-59 were discarded. The final mass list reflects only those masses that were potential cross-linked peptides. The isotopic distribution for each of these masses was checked to ensure that it did not overlap with any other masses and that the distribution clearly showed that the spectrometer software had assigned the correct monoisotopic peak. In most cases, each mass matched only one or sometimes two possible cross-linked peptides. Only masses with unique matches are presented, unless one of two non-uniquely matched target sequences was also identified for another mass with a unique match. Tandem MS Data Analysis—Cross-linked peptide precursor ions were analyzed by MS/MS (as above), and MS/MS data were analyzed using MS2Assign (52Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W.
