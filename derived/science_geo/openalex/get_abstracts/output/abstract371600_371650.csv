Defects in innate immune response may contribute to the overproduction of TNF-alpha leading to systemic inflammation and diseases. Thus, the innate immune response needs to be tightly regulated by elaborate mechanisms to control its onset and termination. LPS tolerance is a state of hyporesponsiveness to subsequent LPS challenge and is achieved by monocytic cells after prolonged exposure to LPS. In this report, kinetics of endotoxin-responsive microRNAs expression analysis revealed a unique pattern of gradual increase for miR-146a starting 4 h after LPS stimulation in THP-1 cells and continued up to 35-fold over 24 h. Conversely, TNF-alpha increased up to 4 h and then decreased gradually implicating a negative correlation with miR-146a progression. The characteristic up-regulation of miR-146a toward subsequent LPS challenge in THP-1 cells was studied. Strikingly, microRNA expression analysis during the tolerized state of THP-1 cells showed only miR-146a overexpression suggesting its important role in LPS tolerance. In addition, LPS tolerance was dependent on a LPS-priming dose and associated miR-146a up-regulation. LPS-tolerized cells were observed to regain responsiveness in TNF-alpha production 22 h after LPS removal correlating with a decrease in miR-146a level. Transfection of miR-146a into THP-1 cells mimicked LPS priming, whereas transfection of miR-146a inhibitor largely abolished LPS tolerance. Thus our studies demonstrated that miR-146a is critical for the in vitro monocytic cell-based endotoxin tolerance."

This requirement is clearly evident during critical periods of activity-dependent neural development, and accumulating evidence has established a surprising role for the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) proteins in this process. For the nervous system to translate experience into memory and behavior, lasting structural change at synapses must occur. This requirement is clearly evident during critical periods of activity-dependent neural development, and accumulating evidence has established a surprising role for the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) proteins in this process. During critical periods of activity-dependent neural development, early experience sculpts connections to establish adult circuits via the selection and strengthening of subsets of synapses, combined with weakening and elimination of others. This selection process can even begin well before sensory experience. For example, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons from the two eyes are initially intermixed with each other within the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus and later sort from each other to achieve the eye-specific and topographically ordered layers of the LGN. Key experiments indicate that appropriate correlated patterns of neural activity are required for segregation (Stellwagen and Shatz, 2002Stellwagen D. Shatz C.J.

But just how these patterns of early activity contribute to synapse remodeling and ultimately to lasting structural change remain unclear. Several years ago, we initiated studies of LGN synapse remodeling motivated by the hypothesis that changes in gene expression are required to translate initial physiological alterations in synaptic strength into stable long-term structural changes in axonal branching and connectivity. Quite unexpectedly, reductions in neuronal MHCI (class I major histocompatibility complex, also known as HLA in humans) mRNA was discovered in an unbiased PCR-based differential screen for gene expression changes in response to blockade of spontaneous neural activity in the developing fetal cat visual system (Corriveau et al., 1998Corriveau R.A.

In these experiments, weblocked pre- and postsynaptic activity by minipump infusions of the sodium channel blocker TTX during the time of synapse remodeling and formation of eye-specific layers in the LGN. Such blockades prevent the formation of the eye-specific layers but allow growth and branching of LGN RGC axons—though in a now unrestricted manner in which eye-specific layers fail to form (Sretavan et al., 1988Sretavan D.W.

This selective deficit results in mutant mice that have “grossly normal” brain histology and organization and underscores the importance of studying the detailed patterning of synaptic connections. Indeed, changes in the details of activity-driven synaptic patterning may underlie many cognitive and behavioral disorders ranging from autism to schizophrenia. Class I MHCs are transmembrane molecules of the Ig superfamily that comprise a large and highly polymorphic gene family (Maenaka and Jones, 1999Maenaka K. Jones E.Y. MHC superfamily structure and the immune system.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar; over 50 gene sequences are annotated presently in GenBank), subdivided into “classical” (class Ia) or “nonclassical” (class Ib; Amadou et al., 1999Amadou C.

Rev. 1999; 167: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The classical MHCI genes are best known for their roles in cellular-mediated immunity, where one of their primary functions is to present antigenic peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Loading of foreign peptides, such as those derived from viral infection, into the MHCI cleft triggers cell killing consequent to ligation and signaling by the T cell receptor (TCR) and a required subunit, CD3 zeta (CD3z; Love et al.; Kane et al., 2000Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Signal transduction by the TCR for antigen.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). For cell-surface expression, the vast majority of MHCI molecules also require the beta 2 microglobulin (B2m) light chain (Zijlstra et al., 1990Zijlstra M. Bix M. Simister N.E. Loring J.M. Raulet D.H. Jaenish R. Beta 2-microglobulin deficient mice lack CD4–8+ cytolytic T cells.Nature. 1990; 344: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). mRNA for B2m is also present in neurons (Corriveau et al., 1998Corriveau R.A. Huh G.S. Shatz C.J. Regulation of Class I MHC gene expression in the developing and mature CNS by neural activity.Neuron. 1998; 21: 505-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Cell-surface expression of most class Ia MHCs also requires peptide loading, which occurs in the ER via the TAP1 transporter (e.g., Shastri et al., 2002Shastri N. Schwab S. Serwold T. Producing nature's gene chips: the generation of peptides for display by MHC Class I molecules.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the nonclassical MHCI genes. Expression is more restricted to specific tissues, they are less polymorphic, and they can be involved in diverse functions ranging from immune function to transferrin receptor trafficking (Shawar et al., 1994Shawar S.M. Vyas J.M. Rodgers J.R. Rich R.R. Antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I-b molecules.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 839-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Our identification of MHCI in our unbiased screen implied an unexpected role for MHC class I in nervous system development and function. Yet, there had been much controversy over whether or not neurons express MHCI (mRNA or protein). Until relatively recently, it had been thought that, with the exception of damage or viral infection in vivo and/or cytokine stimulation in vitro, neurons did not express MHCI (Lampson, 1995Lampson L.A.

These findings have contributed in part to the idea that the brain is “immune privileged.” Others had argued that neurons express MHCI only when they are electrically silenced (Neumann et al., 1997Neumann H. Schmidt H. Cavalie A. Jenne D. Wekerle H. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression in single neurons of the central nervous system: differential regulation by interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha.J.

Med. 1995; 182: 1201-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)—that is, under pathological conditions. However, it is important to note that in those experiments, fetal hippocampal neurons were dissociated, cultured in vitro, and then stimulated to express MHCI with cytokines followed by TTX. In our experiments, we found that MHCI genes are dynamically regulated in neurons in the healthy, unmanipulated brain during development; expression also remains high in specific regions of adult brain (Corriveau et al., 1998Corriveau R.A. Huh G.S. Shatz C.J.

Boulanger L.M. Du H. Riquelme P. Brotz T.M. Shatz C.J. Functional requirement for Class I MHC in CNS development and plasticity.Science. 2000; 290: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Following blockade of action potentials, there was a clear decrease in mRNAs encoding MHCI in the LGN (Corriveau et al., 1998Corriveau R.A. Huh G.S. Shatz C.J. Regulation of Class I MHC gene expression in the developing and mature CNS by neural activity.Neuron. 1998; 21: 505-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, Goddard et al., 2007Goddard C.A. Butts D. Shatz C.J. Regulation of CNS synapses by neuronal MHC Class I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 6828-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), which is why we had initially picked up this gene in our unbiased screen. Further, MHCI mRNA can be downregulated in LGN neurons not only by blocking spontaneous retinal waves early in development, but also simply by occluding normal vision in one eye during early postnatal life. Conversely, following kainate-induced seizures, MHCI mRNA is increased in adult hippocampal neurons (Corriveau et al., 1998Corriveau R.A. Huh G.S. Shatz C.J. Regulation of Class I MHC gene expression in the developing and mature CNS by neural activity.Neuron. 1998; 21: 505-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Together, these findings clearly demonstrated that neurons in the healthy brain not only normally express MHCI mRNA but that expression can be regulated by neural activity and is correlated with times and places of known synaptic plasticity. Thus, MHCIs are excellent candidates for linking neural activity to structural changes at synapses and imply an unexpected role for MHC class I in nervous system development and function. The discovery that neurons normally express MHCI mRNA in vivo without exogenous cytokine stimulation and that expression is downregulated by activity blockade and upregulated by seizure is opposite the prior in vitro observations. Many recent publications using more sensitive amplification methods to detect both mRNA and protein have demonstrated directly that neurons in rat, mouse, and cat under normal circumstances and in pathogen-free animals express MHCI genes- both classical and nonclassical, as well as B2m (Corriveau et al., 1998Corriveau R.A.

Other notable examples include olfactory receptor neurons in the mouse vomeronasal organ where the M10 family of nonclassical MHCI genes are expressed (Loconto et al., 2003Loconto J. Papes F.

High levels of MeCP2 depress MHC class I expression in neuronal cells.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, these in vivo observations extend and should not be confused with prior in vitro experimental results. Since there are more than 50 MHCI genes in mice, how can one even begin to examine a requirement for MHCI in the CNS without knowing exactly which ones might be involved? Immunologists have generated mice with greatly diminished levels of most MHCI proteins by deleting beta 2 microglobulin (B2m), a protein required for stable cell surface expression (Dorfman et al., 1997Dorfman J.R. Zerrahn J. Coles M.C. Raulet D.H. The basis for self-tolerance of natural killer cells in beta2-microglobulin- and TAP-1- mice.J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5219-5225PubMed Google Scholar), or by deleting TAP1, a protein required for loading of peptide and proper folding of MHC Class I in the endoplasmic reticulum (Tourne et al., 1996Tourne S. van Santen H.M. van Roon M. Berns A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Ploegh H. Biosynthesis of major histocompatibility complex molecules and generation of T cells in TAP1 double-mutant mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The initial studies assessing general roles for MHC class I proteins in synapse remodeling and plasticity used mice lacking both of these genes (hereafter referred to as B2m/TAP−/− mice). We explicitly searched for phenotypes associated with abnormalities of activity-dependent synapse remodeling and plasticity because the original differential display screen demonstrated that activity blockade downregulates MHCI mRNA in the LGN (Corriveau et al., 1998Corriveau R.A. Huh G.S. Shatz C.J. Regulation of Class I MHC gene expression in the developing and mature CNS by neural activity.Neuron. 1998; 21: 505-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that mice lacking B2m/TAP−/− might be similar to mice in which neural activity has been blocked if MHCI proteins play a critical role in this process. Indeed, these mutant mice have defects in developmental remodeling of RGC axons in the LGN that resemble deficits known to result from blocking neural activity. In addition, rules of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in adult mutant mice are shifted: in CA1, long-term potentiation (LTP) is enhanced and long-term depression (LTD) is absent at typical Schaeffer collateral stimulus frequencies (Huh et al., 2000Huh G.S. Boulanger L.M. Du H. Riquelme P. Brotz T.M. Shatz C.J. Functional requirement for Class I MHC in CNS development and plasticity.Science. 2000; 290: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of these mice are consistent with the hypothesis that neuronal MHCI proteins regulate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, as well as structural regression of synapses in the LGN during development. However, it should be stressed that these conclusions were based on indirect evidence from mice lacking molecules required for the folding and stable cell-surface expression of many MHCI proteins, rather than loss or gain-of-function studies of specific MHCI molecules. Clearly, it is now essential to study mice lacking specific MHCI genes and mice with conditional alleles to examine cell type specificity directly. The field desperately needs these new lines of mice, as well as other reagents including antibodies that can recognize individual MHCI proteins in aldehyde-fixed tissue sections, permitting ultrastructural localization. In the immune system, MHCI family members have very short intracellular domains not thought to function in intracellular signaling cascades but instead by interacting with a variety of receptors during cell-mediated immunity. The most famous immune cell receptor is the T cell receptor. While our results suggested a role for MHC1 in neuronal plasticity, it was unclear whether neurons actually expressed MHC receptors. We first examined if neurons express TCR. Although a TCR transcript is selectively expressed and developmentally regulated in cortical layer 6 neurons, no transcribed protein could be detected (Syken and Shatz, 2003Syken J. Shatz C.J. Expression of T Cell Receptor Beta Locus in CNS neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), making the TCR an unlikely candidate MHCI receptor. However CD3z, a component of the TCR needed for signaling (Kane et al., 2000Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Signal transduction by the TCR for antigen.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), is expressed in the LGN transiently during development and is also expressed in the adult hippocampus (Huh et al., 2000Huh G.S. Boulanger L.M. Du H. Riquelme P. Brotz T.M. Shatz C.J. Functional requirement for Class I MHC in CNS development and plasticity.Science. 2000; 290: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, Baudouin et al., 2008Baudouin S.J. Angibaud J. Loussouarn G. Bonnamain V. Matsuura A. Kinebuchi M. Naveilhan P. Boudin H. The signaling adaptor protein CD3zeta is a negative regulator of dendrite development in young neurons.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2444-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In mice lacking CD3z, RGC axons fail to remodel in the LGN and LTP is enhanced in hippocampus (Huh et al., 2000Huh G.S. Boulanger L.M. Du H. Riquelme P. Brotz T.M. Shatz C.J. Functional requirement for Class I MHC in CNS development and plasticity.Science. 2000; 290: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), implying potential roles for CD3z-containing MHCI receptor(s) in the CNS. Another immune receptor thought to bind MHCI is PirB (paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B), an Ig-like transmembrane receptor expressed on various types of immune cells. PirB was discovered in a search for receptors already known to bind MHCI proteins in the immune system. Studies of B cells in vitro have shown that MHCI proteins can bind and signal via PirB (Takai, 2005Takai T. Paired immunoglobulin-like receptors and their MHC class I recognition.Immunology. 2005; 115: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Signaling through PirB is dependent on four tyrosines located within distinct immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) in the intracellular domain and in immune cells activation of PirB is thought to antagonize integrin and MAP Kinase signaling cascades (Takai, 2005Takai T. Paired immunoglobulin-like receptors and their MHC class I recognition.Immunology. 2005; 115: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our in situ hybridization screen revealed that PirB mRNA is highly expressed in certain regions of mouse CNS, particularly in neurons of cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and granule cells in cerebellum. PirB protein is located in growth cones and axons of cerebral cortical neurons in vitro (Syken et al., 2006Syken J. Grandpre T. Kanold P.O. Shatz C.J. PIRB restricts ocular dominance plasticity in visual cortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1795-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Notably, expression of PirB was not detected in the LGN during the period of activity-dependent synapse remodeling, implying that other (possibly CD3 zeta-containing) MHCI receptors might be present. Indeed, several labs have recently added other innate immune receptors to the list of potential neuronal MHCI receptors. For example, Ly49, a member of the NK (natural killer) family of innate immune receptors (Zohar et al., 2008Zohar O. Reiter Y. Bennink J.R. Lev A. Cavallaro S. Paratore S. Pick C.G. Brooker G. Yewdell J.W. Cutting edge: MHC class I-Ly49 interaction regulates neuronal function.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 6447-6451PubMed Google Scholar), as well as KIR (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor; Bryceson et al., 2005Bryceson Y.T. Foster J.A. Kuppusamy S.P. Herkenham M. Long E.O. Expression of a killer cell receptor-like gene in plastic regions of the central nervous system.J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 161: 177-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), have been observed in a variety of CNS neurons. In the absence of functional PirB, the brains of mutant mice are grossly normal (Syken et al., 2006Syken J. Grandpre T. Kanold P.O. Shatz C.J. PIRB restricts ocular dominance plasticity in visual cortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1795-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Since PirB mRNA is highly expressed in cortex (but not LGN), we examined if the ocular dominance of neurons in primary visual cortex is normal by using a convenient immediate-early gene induction method for Arc mRNA to map functionally inputs from each eye to cortical neurons (Tagawa et al., 2005Tagawa Y. Kanold P.O. Majdan M. Shatz C.J. Multiple periods of functional ocular dominance plasticity in mouse visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 3: 380-388Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). While the initial development of eye input to cortex occurs normally in PirB−/− mutant mice, ocular dominance (OD) plasticity is far from normal. Following monocular enucleation or monocular visual deprivation in PirB−/− mice during the critical period, OD plasticity is significantly enhanced over WT (Syken et al., 2006Syken J. Grandpre T. Kanold P.O. Shatz C.J. PIRB restricts ocular dominance plasticity in visual cortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1795-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Enhanced OD plasticity is even apparent in adulthood. Once again, these results stress the need to assess detailed aspects of synaptic patterning and activity when examining mutant phenotypes. Importantly, there are very few examples where loss of gene function results in enhanced plasticity; Nogo receptor (NgR) mutant mice have a OD plasticity phenotype in adult visual cortex similar to that of PirB mutant mice (McGee et al., 2005McGee A.W. Yang Y. Fischer Q.S. Daw N.W. Strittmatter S.M. Experience-driven plasticity of visual cortex limited by myelin and Nogo receptor.Science. 2005; 309: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Recently, in a most unexpected intersection of research on axonal regeneration with that on neural plasticity, PirB was also found to bind Nogo peptide and to regulate growth cone inhibition on myelin substrates (Atwal et al., 2008Atwal J.K. Pinkston-Gosse J. Syken J. Stawicki S. Wu Y. Shatz C.J. Tessier-Lavigne M.T. PirB is a functional receptor for myelin inhibitors of axonal regeneration.Science. 2008; 322: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), implying that in some instances PirB and NgR may function in a complex that also includes Nogo peptide. While these results are intriguing, there are a number of key unanswered questions including whether growth cone inhibition also requires the participation of MHCI proteins. It is also essential to determine if MHCI mutant mice have phenotypes similar to those of PirB−/− and/or NgR−/− mice. Similar neuronal phenotypes would be consistent with PirB acting as a receptor for neuronal MHCI. Similarities in synaptic plasticity phenotypes would lend support to a working model of neuronal MHCI interacting and signaling via PirB or other immune receptors expressed on neurons. Based on observations of MHCI immunostaining localized to the postsynaptic densities and dendrites of hippocampal neurons in culture (Goddard et al., 2007Goddard C.A. Butts D. Shatz C.J. Regulation of CNS synapses by neuronal MHC Class I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 6828-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and Purkinje cell proximal dendrites in fixed tissue sections (McConnell et al., 2009McConnell M.J. Huang Y.H. Datwani A. Shatz C.J. H2-Kb and H2-Db regulate cerebellar long term depression and limit motor learning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a first iteration model would suggest that MHCI proteins are located postsynaptically at or near synapses (Figure 1). MHCI might then interact across the synapse with immune receptors such as PirB, located presynaptically based on the observation that PirB immunostaining is localized near synapsin- positive vesicles in the growth cones of cortical neurons in culture (Syken et al., 2006Syken J.

MHCI levels are decreased by activity blockade (Corriveau et al., 1998Corriveau R.A. Huh G.S. Shatz C.J.

Patterson S. Alarcon J.M. Gromova P. Mata-Roig M. Morozov A. Kandel E.R.

Thus, it is possible that MHCI acts downstream of synaptic activity, changes in intracellular Ca2+ and CREB, to regulate the degree and possibly the sign of synaptic plasticity. Note that this is not to imply that MHCI molecules are acting as cell type-specific markers (such as eye-specific markers in the LGN). Indeed, the normal expression patterns, along with the phenotypes seen in mutant mice, do not seem consistent with this idea. However, another not mutually exclusive possibility is that MHCI molecules could alter trafficking of glutamate receptors by acting in cis as “chaperones,” based on analogy with certain nonclassical MHCIs and their role in trafficking of transferrin receptors (Bennett et al., 2000Bennett M.J. Lebron J.A. Bjorkman P.J. Crystal structure of the hereditary hemochromatosisprotein HFE complexed with the transferrin receptor.Nature. 2000; 403: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Immune and neuronal synapses could have much more in common than thought originally (Dustin and Colman, 2002Dustin M.L. Colman D.R. Neural and immunological synaptic relations.Science. 2002; 298: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Clearly, the unresolved question of where MHCI is located and how it signals in neurons is a key to understanding the function of this large gene family. Given examples in the immune system, there could be multiple modes of signaling in the CNS as well. These are early days for newly proposed roles of MHCI in neurons. Consequently, few labs have considered whether or how dysregulation of MHCI in the CNS might contribute to pathology. Since the initial report of MHCI expression and activity regulation in healthy neurons (Corriveau et al., 1998Corriveau R.A. Huh G.S. Shatz C.J. Regulation of Class I MHC gene expression in the developing and mature CNS by neural activity.Neuron. 1998; 21: 505-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), fascinating hints about MHCI function in the context of synapse plasticity, learning and memory have come to light. For example, work from the Kandel lab (Barco et al., 2005Barco A. Patterson S. Alarcon J.M. Gromova P. Mata-Roig M. Morozov A. Kandel E.R. Gene expression profiling of facilitated L-LTP in VP16-CREB mice reveals that BDNF is critical for the maintenance of LTP and its synaptic capture.Neuron. 2005; 48: 123-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the same set of MHCI genes known to be expressed in normal hippocampal neurons (Huh et al., 2000Huh G.S. Boulanger L.M. Du H. Riquelme P. Brotz T.M. Shatz C.J. Functional requirement for Class I MHC in CNS development and plasticity.Science. 2000; 290: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) are also regulated by CREB. Transgenic mice that express CREB in the hippocampus under a constitutive (VP16) promoter have highly elevated mRNAs for H2-K, H2-D, among other MHCIs, implying that these may be part of a process whereby LTP is read out. Screens for dendritic mRNAs in hippocampal neurons have identified MHCIs (Zhong et al., 2006Zhong J. Zhang T. Bloch L.M. Dendritic mRNAs encode diversified functionalities in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.BMC Neurosci. 2006; 7: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and MHCI mRNAs are reported to be enriched over 4-fold in the FMRP-mRNP complex in dendrites (Brown et al., 2001Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W.T. Tenenbaum S.A. Jin X. Feng Y. Wilkinson K.D. Keene J.D. et al.Microarray identification of FMRP-associated brain mRNAs and altered mRNA translational profiles in fragile X syndrome.Cell. 2001; 107: 477-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that MHCI could be synthesized locally in dendrites and regulated by Fragile X protein. Mouse models of Fragile X have alterations in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and OD plasticity in visual cortex (Huber et al., 2002Huber K.M. Gallagher S.M. Warren S.T. Bear M.F. Altered synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of fragile X mental retardation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7746-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, Dölen et al., 2007Dölen G.

Correction of fragile X syndrome in mice.Neuron. 2007; 56: 955-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) related to those seen in B2m/TAP−/− and PirB−/− mutant mice. MHCI protein may be upregulated in cortex of mice expressing the mutant form of MeCP2 that is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Rett syndrome (Miralvès et al., 2007Miralvès J. Magdeleine E. Kaddoum L. Brun H. Peries S. Joly E. High levels of MeCP2 depress MHC class I expression in neuronal cells.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is even conceivable that altered MHCI expression contributes to synaptic changes and learning defects in Fragile X and Rett (Moretti et al., 2006Moretti P. Levenson J.M. Battaglia F. Atkinson R. Teague R. Antalffy B. Armstrong D. Arancio O. Sweatt J.D. Zoghbi H.Y. Learning and memory and synaptic plasticity are impaired in a mouse model of Rett syndrome.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, Chahrour et al., 2008Chahrour M. Jung S.Y. Shaw C. Zhou X. Wong S.T. Qin J. Zoghbi H.Y. MeCP2, a key contributor to neurological disease, activates and represses transcription.Science. 2008; 320: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). In this regard, it will be important to determine whether or not mice lacking MHCI function also have changes in behaviors related to learning and memory. It is already known that mice lacking expression of just two of the more than 50 MHCI molecules (H2-K and H2-D) have enhanced motor learning on the rotarod, as well as lower threshold LTD in the cerebellum (McConnell et al., 2009McConnell M.J. Huang Y.H. Datwani A. Shatz C.J. H2-Kb and H2-Db regulate cerebellar long term depression and limit motor learning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Given these considerations, it is possible to imagine that altered MHCI function in the human brain could also result in changes in learning and memory, some of which could even result in enhancements to behavior and cognition. The presence of MHCI in neurons also suggests new ways to understand and ultimately to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders including those with known autoimmune components such as multiple sclerosis (Bhat and Steinman, 2009Bhat R. Steinman L. Innate and adaptive autoimmunity directed to the central nervous system.Neuron. 2009; 64 (this issue): 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar [this issue of Neuron]). It is also known that exogenous cytokines such as TNF alpha can alter MHCI cell surface expression on neurons (Neumann et al., 1997Neumann H. Schmidt H. Cavalie A. Jenne D. Wekerle H. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression in single neurons of the central nervous system: differential regulation by interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha.J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and recent elegant studies have now demonstrated a normal role for cytokines such as TNF alpha in LTD (Beattie et al., 2002Beattie E.C. Stellwagen D. Morishita W. Bresnahan J.C. Ha B.K. Von Zastrow M. Beattie M.S. Malenka R.C. Control of synaptic strength by glial TNFalpha.Science. 2002; 295: 2282-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) and OD plasticity in vivo (Kaneko et al., 2008Kaneko M. Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Stryker M.P. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mediates one component of competitive, experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 58: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, damage and inflammation might lead to changes in synaptic plasticity and memory function via dysregulation of MHCI expression. In a series of three genome-wide studies of large populations published recently (Shi et al., 2009Shi J. Levinson D.F. Duan J. Sanders A.R. Zheng Y. Pe'er I. Dudbridge F. Holmans P.A. Whittemore A.S.

International Schizophrenia ConsortiumCommon polygenic variation contributes to risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.Nature. 2009; 460: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar), polygenic variations on human chromosome 6p22.1 at the MHCI locus have now been implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While many common gene variants in the MHC region (both class I and class II) are strongly associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, there was no association with several non-psychiatric disorders. The authors of the studies related their observations regarding the MHCI region to the popular idea that there is a link between schizophrenia and infection or autoimmunity (Patterson, 2009Patterson P.H. Immune involvement in schizophrenia and autism: etiology, pathology and animal models.Behav. Brain Res. 2009; 204: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). While this proposal is reasonable, a burning question remains: how can early infection or autoimmune disorders change brain circuits and behavior? If neuronal MHCI indeed functions at synapses, then the immune system would have a variety of rather direct ways of communicating with and altering activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and circuit tuning. Major challenges for the future will be not only to identify MHCI molecules and receptors in the human brain, but also to understand how the extraordinary polymorphism at the MHCI locus contributes to brain function and dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W2023401038,"Despite almost 40 years of molecular genetics research in Escherichia coli a major fraction of its Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) are still unknown, limiting therefore our understanding of the regulatory circuits that control gene expression in this model organism. RegulonDB (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) is aimed at integrating the genetic regulatory network of E. coli K12 as an entirely bioinformatic project up till now. In this work, we extended its aims by generating experimental data at a genome scale on TSSs, promoters and regulatory regions. We implemented a modified 5′ RACE protocol and an unbiased High Throughput Pyrosequencing Strategy (HTPS) that allowed us to map more than 1700 TSSs with high precision. From this collection, about 230 corresponded to previously reported TSSs, which helped us to benchmark both our methodologies and the accuracy of the previous mapping experiments. The other ca 1500 TSSs mapped belong to about 1000 different genes, many of them with no assigned function. We identified promoter sequences and type of σ factors that control the expression of about 80% of these genes. As expected, the housekeeping σ70 was the most common type of promoter, followed by σ38. The majority of the putative TSSs were located between 20 to 40 nucleotides from the translational start site. Putative regulatory binding sites for transcription factors were detected upstream of many TSSs. For a few transcripts, riboswitches and small RNAs were found. Several genes also had additional TSSs within the coding region. Unexpectedly, the HTPS experiments revealed extensive antisense transcription, probably for regulatory functions. The new information in RegulonDB, now with more than 2400 experimentally determined TSSs, strengthens the accuracy of promoter prediction, operon structure, and regulatory networks and provides valuable new information that will facilitate the understanding from a global perspective the complex and intricate regulatory network that operates in E. coli."

In this study, we assessed the potential of OCT to yield histology-analogue sections in mouse models of retinal degeneration.We achieved to adapt a commercial 3(rd) generation OCT system to obtain and quantify high-resolution morphological sections of the mouse retina which so far required in vitro histology. OCT and histology were compared in models with developmental defects, light damage, and inherited retinal degenerations. In conditional knockout mice deficient in retinal retinoblastoma protein Rb, the gradient of Cre expression from center to periphery, leading to a gradual reduction of retinal thickness, was clearly visible and well topographically quantifiable. In Nrl knockout mice, the layer involvement in the formation of rosette-like structures was similarly clear as in histology. OCT examination of focal light damage, well demarcated by the autofluorescence pattern, revealed a practically complete loss of photoreceptors with preservation of inner retinal layers, but also more subtle changes like edema formation. In Crb1 knockout mice (a model for Leber's congenital amaurosis), retinal vessels slipping through the outer nuclear layer towards the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) due to the lack of adhesion in the subapical region of the photoreceptor inner segments could be well identified.We found that with the OCT we were able to detect and analyze a wide range of mouse retinal pathology, and the results compared well to histological sections. In addition, the technique allows to follow individual animals over time, thereby reducing the numbers of study animals needed, and to assess dynamic processes like edema formation. The results clearly indicate that OCT has the potential to revolutionize the future design of respective short- and long-term studies, as well as the preclinical assessment of therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2084688946,"Co-overexpression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and c-Src frequently occurs in human tumors and is linked to enhanced tumor growth. In experimental systems this synergistic growth requires EGF-dependent association of c-Src with the EGFR and phosphorylation of Tyr-845 of the receptor by c-Src. A search for signaling mediators of Tyr(P)-845 revealed that mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CoxII) binds EGFR in a Tyr(P)-845- and EGF-dependent manner. In cells this association involves translocation of EGFR to the mitochondria, but regulation of this process is ill-defined. The current study demonstrates that c-Src translocates to the mitochondria with similar kinetics as EGFR and that the catalytic activity of EGFR and c-Src as well as endocytosis and a mitochondrial localization signal are required for these events. CoxII can be phosphorylated by EGFR and c-Src, and EGF stimulation reduces Cox activity and cellular ATP, an event that is dependent in large part on EGFR localized to the mitochondria.

Investigations in murine fibroblasts and in human breast cancer cells have revealed synergistic increases in DNA synthesis, soft agar colony growth, and tumor formation in nude mice when EGFR and c-Src are co-overexpressed as compared with cells overexpressing EGFR or c-Src alone (5.Maa M.C.

Subsequent efforts to identify mediators of the Tyr(P)-845 EGFR mitogenic signal revealed that phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of Stat5b are dependent on Tyr(P)-845 and that Stat5b is required for EGF-induced DNA synthesis (8.Kloth M.T.

Phage display screening of a human breast cancer tissue library also identified cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CoxII) as a protein that binds the EGFR in a Tyr(P)-845- and EGF-dependent manner (9.Boerner J.L. Demory M.L. Silva C. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7059-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CoxII is a mitochondrially encoded, transcribed, and translated protein that resides on the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and is a key component of the oxidative phosphorylation cascade (10.Cabral F. Solioz M. Rudin Y. Schatz G. Clavilier L. Slonimski P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 297-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that expression and activity (11.Ludovico P. Rodrigues F. Almeida A. Silva M.T. Barrientos A. Côrte-Real M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2598-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) or protein-protein associations (12.Yang W.L. Iacono L. Tang W.M. Chin K.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14175-14180Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) of Cox subunits may regulate cytochrome c release from the mitochondria during apoptosis. In support of this idea, Boerner et al. (9.Boerner J.L. Demory M.L. Silva C. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7059-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) observed an increase in apoptosis in adriamycin-treated breast cancer cells expressing a mutant Y845F EGFR as compared with those expressing wild type, stimulated receptor. These results were suggestive of a cell survival role for EGFR in CoxII-dependent mitochondrial events. That CoxII and EGFR reside in different subcellular compartments raised the question of where, intracellularly, the two proteins interact. Previous studies using confocal microscopy and biochemical fractionation showed an EGF-dependent transient co-localization of the EGFR at the mitochondria that was maximal around 20 min post stimulation (9.Boerner J.L. Demory M.L. Silva C. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7059-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, regulation of this event was not investigated. In this study, a multifaceted regulatory mechanism for EGFR translocation to the mitochondria is revealed. Evidence is presented that demonstrates EGFR insertion into the mitochondrial membrane, EGF-induced translocation of c-Src to the mitochondria, and a role for c-Src in EGFR translocation. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis and an EGFR mitochondrial localization signal also play critical roles in the process. We find that EGFR and c-Src phosphorylate CoxII and that CoxII phosphorylation is increased after EGF stimulation. Further, EGF treatment results in decreased Cox activity and cellular ATP levels, the latter of which are in part dependent upon EGFR mitochondrial localization. These findings suggest that EGF stimulation alters mitochondrial function in the same time frame as EGFR-mitochondrial co-localization, events that may have implications for growth factor-mediated regulation of cellular bioenergetics and survival.

Cells were then washed, fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield PA) for 20 min, permeabilized in 0.1% saponin in 20% goat serum for 1 h, incubated overnight with EGFR mAb (Transduction Laboratories), washed, stained with ultra small gold (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 2 h, and washed in 20% goat serum followed by phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were again fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, incubated with silver developer and enhancer (Electron Microscopy Sciences), rinsed, post-fixed for 30 min in 1% osmium tetroxide, washed, dehydrated in ethanol and acetone, and infiltrated with epoxy resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at 60 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (70–80 nm) were contrast-stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and viewed in a JEOL 1230 (Japan Electron Optics Limited, Tokyo) transmission electron microscope (80 kV) equipped with a Scientific Instruments and Applications, Inc. (Duluth, GA) 12-C digital camera. Fractionation and preparation of Sprague-Dawley rat forebrain mitochondria was carried out as described (16.Douglas R.M. Lai J.C. Bian S. Cummins L. Moczydlowski E. Haddad G.G. Neuroscience. 2006; 139: 1249-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified mitochondrial fraction was fixed, and pellets were cut into 1-mm cubes, placed on pins, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultra-thin cryosections (∼80 nm) were cut on a UCT cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica) at −130 °C and placed onto carbon- and Formvar-coated nickel grids. Sections were incubated with EGFR mAb (Transduction Laboratories) and Protein A-conjugated 10-nm gold particles (1:50) (Electron Microscopy Sciences) (16.Douglas R.M. Lai J.C. Bian S. Cummins L. Moczydlowski E. Haddad G.G. Neuroscience. 2006; 139: 1249-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and viewed on a JEOL 1200-EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation according to Boerner et al. (9.Boerner J.L. Demory M.L. Silva C. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7059-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Two mg of protein was incubated with EGFR mAb 108, anti-Tom40 pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or a negative antibody control for 24 h at 4 °C. Anti-EGFR (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and anti-Tom40 (Santa Cruz) pAbs were used for immunoblotting. One mg of protein was incubated with CoxII (Invitrogen) or IgG antibody for 24 h at 4 °C. Anti-CoxII (Invitrogen) and anti-phosphotyrosine (Invitrogen) antibodies were used for immunoblotting. Cells were seeded on 15-cm plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) at a density of 3 × 106 cells/plate, cultured, serum-starved, and incubated with or without EGF. Crude mitochondria were obtained by differential centrifugation and subjected to alkali extraction as described by Eskes et al. (40.Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Fractions were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels as cell equivalents (except for whole cell lysates). The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-EGFR rabbit pAb (Cell Signaling), anti-c-Src mouse mAb 2–17, anti-Lamp 2 rabbit pAb (Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen), anti-voltage-dependent anion channel rabbit pAb (Calbiochem), anti-nucleoporin 62 mouse mAb, anti-Rab4 mouse mAb, and anti-Bip/Grp mouse mAb (all from Transduction Laboratories). Antigen-antibody complexes were developed by chemiluminescence (Pico ECL, Pierce) and viewed by audioradiography. To suppress the expression of clathrin heavy chain or Rab7, cells were subjected to nucleofection (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) with clathrin heavy chain siGENOME SMARTpool CLTC, siGENOME SMARTpool RAB7, siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA #1 (all from Dharmacon), or no siRNA as recommended by Amaxa and incubated for 48 h. Cells were then analyzed by confocal microscopy or harvested for Western blotting. Fifty μg of total lysate was immunoblotted with anti-clathrin mouse mAb (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Rab7 pAb (Santa Cruz), or anti-β-actin mouse mAb (Sigma). A fragment encoding amino acids (aa) 622–666 of the EGFR was PCR-amplified from pcDNA-wt EGFR, cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of phrGFP-C vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and used for generation and amplification of the EGFR fragments, aa 622–644 and 645–666. These smaller fragments were then cloned into the phrGFP-C vector between the aforementioned sites. All mutants were sequenced before use. The various enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-EGFR plasmids were nucleofected into 10T1/2 cells overexpressing c-Src using an Amaxa nucleofector as directed by the manufacturer and examined by confocal microscopy. Full-length wt EGFR was PCR-amplified from pcDNA-wt EGFR and inserted into the NotI and XhoI sites of pCMV-Tag1 (Stratagene). pCMV-Tag1-Δ645–666 EGFR was constructed from the wt EGFR vector using the method of Ho et al. (41.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Hortorn R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The entire EGFR coding regions of both plasmids were sequenced before use. HEK 293T cells were transfected with 4 μg of wt EGFR or EGFR Δ645–666 plasmids using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, serum-starved for 24 h, stimulated with EGF, and processed as described. Mitochondria from MCF7 breast cancer cells were purified using a Mitochondria Isolation kit (Pierce). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was further purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and used as a template for PCR amplification of the region of CoxII denoted in Fig. 8B. The resulting fragment was cloned into pBluescript II SK+ vector between the EcoRI and XhoI sites. Because of the unique codon usage in mtDNA, the CoxII sequence was altered for bacterial expression by changing four Ala residues to Gly by PCR. The EcoRI-XhoI fragment of this construct was cloned into pET28a (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ) and named His-CoxII. BL21 Escherichia coli, transformed by His-CoxII pET28a, were induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h at 25 °C. Bacterial pellets were suspended in cold CHAPS buffer (0.65% CHAPS, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 25,000 × g. The His-CoxII peptide was purified by nickel-agarose chromatography, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed for purity by Coomassie stain. Serum-starved MDA-MB-231 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA), and 1 mg of extract protein was immunoprecipitated with CoxII mAb (Invitrogen) or IgG control. Immunoprecipitated CoxII or 0.1 μg of purified His-CoxII was incubated with 18 catalytic units of purified Src (Upstate) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (25 μm) in Src reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate) or 0.025 μg of truncated EGFR (Upstate) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (25 μm) in EGFR reaction buffer (8 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.8 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ⅕ volume 0.5 m EDTA, and samples were resolved by 15% (His-CoxII) or 12% (IP-CoxII) SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to film. Cytochrome c oxidase activity of cells that had been incubated in serum free media or stimulated with EGF for 20 min was analyzed as described (17.Samavati L. Lee I. Mathes I. Lottspeich F. Hüttemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21134-21144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 96-well dishes at a density of 4500–5000 cells/well, cultured for 24 h, starved of serum for 24–48 h in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (fibroblasts) or regular DMEM (MDA-MB-231s), and stimulated with EGF. Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of c-Src and 0.1 μg of wt EGFR, Δ645–666 EGFR, or K721 EGFR plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 before serum starvation and stimulation. ATP concentration was measured with the ATPlite kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to manufacturer's instructions, and luminescence was read by a Synergy 2 single-channel multi-mode microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Fig. 1 depicts EGFR co-localization with the mitochondria in C3H10T1/2 cells co-overexpressing EGFR and c-Src after 20 min of EGF stimulation. The 0-min time point shows EGFR and mitochondria (identified by MitoTracker Red) in separate subcellular compartments, whereas at 20 min of stimulation, the EGFR image could be seen to merge with that of the mitochondria, suggesting a co-localization. Similar results were seen with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (supplemental Fig. 2C and Z-stack images in supplemental Movies 1 and 2) and with either 10, 50, or 100 ng/ml EGF (data not shown). Quantification revealed that EGFR co-localized with the mitochondria in 30% of cells (Fig. 1B), and 5–10% of the total receptor in the cell was found in this compartment (Fig. 2D). By 30 or 40 min of EGF treatment, significantly less co-localization was observed (Fig. 1B, supplemental Fig. 1, and Ref. 9.Boerner J.L. Demory M.L. Silva C. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7059-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These results, along with our published data support the idea that maximal detection of EGFR at the mitochondria occurs 10–30 min post-EGF stimulation and that the co-localization is transient.FIGURE 2EGFR localizes to the mitochondria. A, 10T1/2 cells co-overexpressing EGFR and c-Src were cultured in serum-free media for 24 h, left untreated or stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 20 min, and processed for immunoelectron microscopy analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrows indicate positive EGFR staining. B, mitochondria were purified from rat brain and subjected to immunoelectron analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were stained with either anti-EGFR antibody or no primary antibody as a control. Arrows indicate positive EGFR staining in the mitochondria. C, lysates from EGF-stimulated or non-stimulated 10T1/2 cells co-overexpressing EGFR and c-Src were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two mg of protein lysate was immunoprecipitated (IP) with EGFR, Tom40 (goat), Tom40 (rabbit), or control IgG. Precipitated proteins were immunoblotted (WB) with EGFR or Tom40 antibodies. D, biochemical fractionation of the EGFR and c-Src with the mitochondria is shown. 10T1/2 cells were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractionation yielded proteins present in and associated with the mitochondria (crude mitochondria), proteins inserted in the mitochondrial membrane (alkali-resistant), and proteins peripherally attached to the mitochondrial membrane (alkali-sensitive). Fractions containing cell equivalents were immunoblotted with the following antibodies: EGFR, c-Src, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), Rab4, Nucleoporin62, Bip/Grp, and Lamp2. Crude mitochondrial fractions represent 80 times the volume of whole cell lysates (WCL) present on the immunoblot, whereas alkali-resistant and -sensitive fractions represent 26 times the whole cell lysate volume. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electron microscopy of 10T1/2 cells co-overexpressing c-Src and EGFR (Fig. 2A) and of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (data not shown) also revealed positive EGFR staining in the mitochondria of EGF-stimulated cells. Similarly, electron microscopy of purified rat brain mitochondria demonstrated specific EGFR staining (Fig. 2B). To determine if EGFR could associate with mitochondrial proteins other than CoxII, immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts from 10T1/2 double overexpressors were performed. Fig. 2C shows that EGFR co-immunoprecipitated with Tom40, an outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) transport protein, in a reciprocal and EGF-dependent fashion. Fig. 2D shows that the full-length receptor biochemically co-fractionates with the mitochondria and is predominantly present in the alkali-resistant (membrane-inserted) fraction, purifying with the voltage-dependent anion channel. Western blotting for endosomal, lysosomal endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear markers indicated that the alkali-extracted fractions were relatively clear of these organelles or vesicles. Together, these results suggest that the full-length EGFR can associate with an OMM protein and insert into mitochondrial membranes after EGF stimulation. Because c-Src phosphorylates Tyr-845 of the EGFR (7.Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), Tyr(P)-845 directly interacts with CoxII in the mitochondria (9.Boerner J.L. Demory M.L. Silva C. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7059-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and c-Src has been found in the mitochondria of osteoclasts and bovine aortic endothelial cells (18.Miyazaki T. Neff L. Tanaka S. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19.Itoh S. Lemay S. Osawa M. Che W. Duan Y. Tompkins A. Brookes P.S. Sheu S.S. Abe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26383-26396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), c-Src localization after EGF stimulation was tracked in 10T1/2 cells co-overexpressing EGFR and c-Src. Confocal microscopy (Fig. 3A) revealed that maximal increases in c-Src localization at the mitochondria occurred 20 min post-EGF stimulation, mimicking the time course of the EGFR, and that 21% of the cells examined showed c-Src co-localization with the mitochondria at this time (Fig. 3B). Biochemical fractionation also revealed c-Src in both the inserted and peripherally attached fractions (Fig. 2D). To determine if the maximal increases in EGFR and c-Src at the mitochondria occurred simultaneously, 10T1/2 cells co-overexpressing EGFR and c-Src were immunostained for EGFR, c-Src, and mitochondria. Supplemental Fig. 1 shows a maximal merge of the stains at 20 min of EGF stimulation, suggesting EGFR and c-Src can translocate to the mitochondria simultaneously. Boerner et al. (9.Boerner J.L. Demory M.L. Silva C. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7059-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) showed that EGFR overexpression greatly facilitated detection of EGF-stimulated EGFR translocation to the mitochondria. To determine if overexpression of c-Src also increased detection of the EGFR at the mitochondria, 10T1/2 cells with overexpressed EGFR and endogenous levels of c-Src were subjected to confocal microscopy. Fig. 4A shows a reduction in EGFR localization at the mitochondria after EGF stimulation as compared with Fig. 1, suggesting that overexpression of c-Src enhances EGFR-mitochondrial translocation. That the catalytic activity of c-Src is critical for this event is demonstrated by decreased EGFR translocation in 10T1/2 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing EGFR and c-Src upon treatment with the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2 (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 2, A and C) or by 10T1/2 cells stably overexpressing wt EGFR and kinase-defective c-Src (supplemental Fig. 2B). Only 2% of 10T1/2 cells exhibited EGFR-mitochondrial co-localization after PP2 treatment (Fig. 4B). Combined, these results indicate that c-Src overexpression and kinase activity enhance EGFR translocation to the mitochondria. Because c-Src and EGFR expression levels and kinase activities regulate the frequency of EGFR seen at the mitochondria, we asked what factors might regulate c-Src translocation to the mitochondria. Fig. 5A shows that in 10T1/2 cells with overexpressed c-Src and endogenous levels of EGFR, detection of c-Src at the mitochondria in response to EGF was greatly reduced as compared with cells co-overexpressing both c-Src and EGFR (Fig. 3), suggesting that overexpression of EGFR promotes c-Src translocation to the mitochondria. Similarly, mutational (Fig. 5B) or pharmacological (Fig. 5C) inhibition of c-Src activity (PP2) or pharmacological inhibition of the EGFR (AG1478) (Fig. 5D) demonstrated the requirement for the catalytic activities of c-Src and EGFR for maximal increases in c-Src at the mitochondria. Combined, these results suggest that EGFR and c-Src co-overexpression and kinase activities enhance EGF-dependent translocation of c-Src and the EGFR to the mitochondria. The dependence of the translocation on EGFR and c-Src tyrosine kinase activities, both of which have been shown to facilitate EGFR endocytosis (20.Ware M.F. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Lauffenburger D.A.

We asked whether mechanical up-regulation of β-catenin was critical to reduction in adipogenesis as well as other mechanical events inducing alternate MSC lineage selection. In MSC cultured under strong adipogenic conditions, mechanical load (3600 cycles/day, 2% strain) inactivated GSK3β in a Wnt-independent fashion. Small interfering RNA targeting GSK3β prevented both strain-induced induction of β-catenin and an increase in COX2, a factor associated with increased osteoprogenitor phenotype. Small interfering RNA knockdown of β-catenin blocked mechanical reduction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and adiponectin, implicating β-catenin in strain inhibition of adipogenesis. In contrast, the effect of both mechanical and pharmacologic inhibition of GSK3β on the putative β-catenin target, COX2, was unaffected by β-catenin knockdown. GSK3β inhibition caused accumulation of nuclear NFATc1; mechanical strain increased nuclear NFATc1, independent of β-catenin. NFATc1 knockdown prevented mechanical stimulation of COX2, implicating NFATc1 signaling. Finally, inhibition of GSK3β caused association of RNA polymerase II with the COX2 gene, suggesting transcription initiation. These results demonstrate that mechanical inhibition of GSK3β induces activation of both β-catenin and NFATc1 signaling, limiting adipogenesis via the former and promoting osteoblastic differentiation via NFATc1/COX2. Our novel findings suggest that mechanical loading regulates mesenchymal stem cell differentiation through inhibition of GSK3β, which in turn regulates multiple downstream effectors.

https://openalex.org/W1485189476,"Approximately 80% of breast cancers express the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) and are treated with anti-estrogens. Resistance to these agents is a major cause of mortality. We have shown that estrogen inhibits Notch, whereas anti-estrogens or estrogen withdrawal activate Notch signaling. Combined inhibition of Notch and estrogen signaling has synergistic effects in ERalpha-positive breast cancer models. However, the mechanisms whereby Notch-1 promotes the growth of ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Notch-1 increases the transcription of ERalpha-responsive genes in the presence or absence of estrogen via a novel chromatin crosstalk mechanism. Our data support a model in which Notch-1 can activate the transcription of ERalpha-target genes via IKKalpha-dependent cooperative chromatin recruitment of Notch-CSL-MAML1 transcriptional complexes (NTC) and ERalpha, which promotes the recruitment of p300. CSL binding elements frequently occur in close proximity to estrogen-responsive elements (EREs) in the human and mouse genomes. Our observations suggest that a hitherto unknown Notch-1/ERalpha chromatin crosstalk mediates Notch signaling effects in ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells and contributes to regulate the transcriptional functions of ERalpha itself."
https://openalex.org/W1989003932,"One major theory in learning and memory posits that the NR2B gene is a universal genetic factor that acts as rate-limiting molecule in controlling the optimal NMDA receptor's coincidence-detection property and subsequent learning and memory function across multiple animal species. If so, can memory function be enhanced via transgenic overexpression of NR2B in another species other than the previously reported mouse species? To examine these crucial issues, we generated transgenic rats in which NR2B is overexpressed in the cortex and hippocampus and investigated the role of NR2B gene in NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity and memory functions by combining electrophysiological technique with behavioral measurements. We found that overexpression of the NR2B subunit had no effect on CA1-LTD, but rather resulted in enhanced CA1-LTP and improved memory performances in novel object recognition test, spatial water maze, and delayed-to-nonmatch working memory test. Our slices recordings using NR2A- and NR2B-selective antagonists further demonstrate that the larger LTP in transgenic hippocampal slices was due to contribution from the increased NR2B-containing NMDARs. Therefore, our genetic experiments suggest that NR2B at CA1 synapses is not designated as a rate-limiting factor for the induction of long-term synaptic depression, but rather plays a crucial role in initiating the synaptic potentiation. Moreover, our studies provide strong evidence that the NR2B subunit represents a universal rate-limiting molecule for gating NMDA receptor's optimal coincidence-detection property and for enhancing memory function in adulthood across multiple mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W2060892630,"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as PCBs, DDT and dioxins have in several cross-sectional studies shown strong associations with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Reversed causality can however not be excluded. The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate whether POPs concentration is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.A case-control study was performed within a well-defined cohort of women, age 50-59 years, from the Southern part of Sweden. Biomarkers for POP exposure, 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (p,p'-DDE) were analyzed in stored serum samples, which were collected at the baseline examination when the cohort was established. For 107 out of the 371 cases, serum samples were stored at least three years before their type 2 diabetes was diagnosed. In this data set, CB-153 and p,p'-DDE were not associated with an increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes. However, when only the cases (n = 39) that were diagnosed more than six years after the baseline examination and their controls were studied, the women in the highest exposed quartile showed an increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes (OR of 1.6 [95% 0.61, 4.0] for CB-153 and 5.5 [95% CI 1.2, 25] for p,p'-DDE).The results from the present case-control study, including a follow-up design, confirms that p,p'-DDE exposure can be a risk factor for type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2045948167,"The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) correlates with poor clinical outcomes and confers resistance to the apoptosis of the tumor cells that are exposed to hypoxia. Presently, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is poorly understood. In this study we provide evidence that transglutaminase 2 (TG2), an enzyme that catalyses protein crosslinking reactions, is a transcriptional target of HIF-1 to enhance the survival of hypoxic cells. We found that hypoxia induces TG2 expression through an HIF-1 dependent pathway and concurrently activates intracellular TG2. The hypoxic cells overexpressing TG2 showed resistance to apoptosis. Conversely, the hypoxic cells treated with either TG2 inhibitor or small interfering RNA (siRNA) became sensitive to apoptosis. Activation of TG2 in response to hypoxic stress inhibited caspase-3 activity by forming crosslinked multimer, resulting in insoluble aggregates. TG2 also activates nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway after hypoxic stress, and thereby induces the expression of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2. The anti-apoptotic role of TG2 was further confirmed in vivo using xenografts in athymic mice. Our results indicate that TG2 is an anti-apoptotic mediator of HIF-1 through modulating both apoptosis and survival pathways and may confer a selective growth advantage to tumor cells. These findings suggest that the inhibition of TG2 may offer a novel strategy for anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2081040572,"G-protein-coupled receptors are thought to transmit extracellular signals to the cytoplasm from their position on the cell surface. Some receptors, including the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), are also highly expressed on intracellular membranes where they serve unknown functions. Here, we show that activation of cell surface versus intracellular mGluR5 results in unique Ca2+ signatures leading to unique cellular responses. Specifically, activation of either cell surface or intracellular mGluR5 leads to JNK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), and cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation, whereas activation of only intracellular mGluR5 leads to ERK1/2 and Elk-1 phosphorylation. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, the present findings support a role for CaMK kinase in mediating mGluR5-dependent cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation, whereas CaMKII is upstream of intracellular mGluR5-mediated Elk-1 phosphorylation. Consistent with models showing Elk-1 regulating cascades of gene expression, the known Elk-1 targets c-fos and egr1 were up-regulated following intracellular mGluR5 activation, whereas a representative non-Elk-1 target, c-jun, was not. These findings emphasize that glutamate not only serves as a neurotransmitter for cell surface receptors but, when transported into the cell, can also activate intracellular receptors such as mGluR5.

Glutamate activation of intracellular mGluR5 serves an important role in the regulation of nuclear Ca2+, transcriptional activation, and gene expression necessary for physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity. G-protein-coupled receptors are known for converting extracellular signals into intracellular responses. Some receptors, however, are also localized on intracellular membranes where they perform unknown functions. For instance, 50–90% of the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, 2The abbreviations used are: mGluR5metabotropic glutamate receptor 5CREcAMP-response elementCREBcyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-responsive element-binding proteinCaMKcyclic adenosine Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseCAMKKCaMK kinasedndominant negativeMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseIEGimmediate early geneSREserum-response elementQuisquisqualateDHPG(S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycineAMPAα-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionateMEKMAPK/ERK kinase. which plays an active role in neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, as well as in various neurological (anxiety, seizures, and addiction) and neurodevelopmental (Fragile X syndrome and autism) disorders, is found on endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes (1.Hubert G.W.

In the striatum, we have shown that mGluR5 is expressed on nuclear membranes where it can couple to Gq/11 leading to phosphoinositide signaling and release of Ca2+ from nuclear stores. Moreover, results demonstrate that both sodium-dependent and -independent transporters are involved in moving agonist across extra- and intracellular membranes; inhibition of either transport system blocks agonist-induced nuclear Ca2+ changes (4.Jong Y.J.

Thus, mechanisms exist whereby intracellular receptors like mGluR5 may be activated and in turn trigger intracellular signal transduction processes. What are the functional consequences of activating intracellular mGluR5? In the nucleus, Ca2+ is generated by diffusion of cytosolic Ca2+ waves through nuclear pore complexes (6.Alonso M.T. Villalobos C. Chamero P. Alvarez J. García-Sancho J. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or by release from the lumen of the nuclear envelope (7.Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3087-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8.Klein C. Malviya A.N. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 1206-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Presumably, release of Ca2+ from the nuclear lumen would amplify Ca2+ signals crossing the nuclear envelope via the pore complex and/or independently generate nucleoplasmic Ca2+ transients. Converging Ca2+ transients may change the amplitude, duration, and spatial characteristics of a Ca2+ signal leading to differential activation of various transcriptional regulators and co-activators as well as their modifying enzymes (9.Dolmetsch R. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: PE4PubMed Google Scholar). Two signal transduction pathways linking neuronal activity to transcriptional changes in the nucleus include Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) and the MAPK pathways via ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, or stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (10.Swulius M.T. Waxham M.N. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2637-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Both pathways can lead to the phosphorylation of cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), which plays an important role in survival and plasticity. Activation of the Ets transcription factor, Elk-1, also requires nuclear Ca2+ (11.Pusl T. Wu J.J. Zimmerman T.L. Zhang L. Ehrlich B.E. Berchtold M.W. Hoek J.B. Karpen S.J. Nathanson M.H. Bennett A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27517-27527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A known target for MAPK signaling pathways, Elk-1 is an essential component of a ternary complex that activates the promoter of c-fos and other immediate early genes (IEG) (12.Shaw P.E. Saxton J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1210-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that mGluR5 activation leads to ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the up-regulation of CREB and Elk-1, findings that reinforce the notion that mGluR5 modulates synaptic plasticity (13.Wang J.Q. Fibuch E.E. Mao L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, whether these responses are due to cell surface or intracellular receptors is unclear. To test the hypothesis that activation of intracellular mGluR5 leads to unique changes in signal transduction and subsequently gene expression, we used pharmacological, genetic, and molecular tools. Here, we show that activation of intracellular mGluR5 generates distinct Ca2+ responses as well as downstream signaling cascades separate from their cell surface counterparts. These observations challenge the notion that cells only interact with their environment at the plasma membrane to bring about long term changes. Drugs were as described previously (4.Jong Y.J.

Primary striatal cultures using neonatal rat or mouse pups were prepared, maintained, and treated as detailed (4.Jong Y.J. Kumar V. Kingston A.E. Romano C. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30469-30480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). mGluR5 knock-out mice were obtained from Dr. M. A. Schwarzchild (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston). Heterozygous mice were mated to produce wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mGluR5-deficient pups that were individually genotyped by PCR using DNA prepared from cortical tissue. Striatal tissue from each pup was processed separately. The “kinase-dead” dominant-negative (dn) CaMK constructs dnCaMKI, dnCaMKIV, and dnCaMKK were obtained from Dr. T. R. Soderling (Oregon Health and Science University, Portland). The dnCaMKII was obtained from Dr. U. Bayer (University of Colorado, Denver). Cultures (50,000 cells/dish) were transfected with vectors expressing dnCaMKK (K71A, T108A, and S458A), dnCaMKI (K49E, T177A, I286D/H287D/Q288E/S289E, and F307A), dnCaMKIV nuclear (T196A, K71E, and H305D/M306E/T308D), or dnCaMKII (K42M) fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (14.Wayman G.A.

Treatment and subsequent analysis was done 24 h post-transfection. Primary striatal neurons were fixed and stained as described previously (4.Jong Y.J. Kumar V. Kingston A.E. Romano C. O'Malley K.L.

Western blotting was performed using whole cell extracts from 14 days in vitro striatal culture or purified nuclei from postnatal day 10 rodent striata (4.Jong Y.J. Kumar V. Kingston A.E. Romano C. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30469-30480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Antibody dilutions and sources for immunostaining and Western blotting (supplemental material) are as described previously (4.Jong Y.J. Kumar V. Kingston A.E. Romano C. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol.

Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) followed by densitometric analysis (Storm 860 Imager, (GE Healthcare) together with associated software). 12–14 days in vitro striatal neurons were loaded with Ca2+ fluorophore, imaged, and quantitated as described previously (4.Jong Y.J. Kumar V. Kingston A.E. Romano C. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30469-30480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase reporter vectors were constructed such that a minimal promoter (Promega, Madison, WI) was modified by the addition of three tandem SREs derived from either the c-fos or egr1 promoters (pGL4/SREc-fos or pGL4/SREegr1) or four tandem CREs derived from the somatostatin promoter (pGL4/CREsoma). Neurons (2 × 106) were co-transfected with each construct (1.8 μg) and the internal control vector pGL4.74 (hRluc/TK) (0.3 μg) containing Renilla luciferase (Promega). After 30 h, drugs were added for 15 min. Cells were then solubilized, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Wallace 1420 VICTOR2TM multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity was calculated after normalization against the transfection reference vector. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed largely as described previously (15.Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) starting with ∼5 × 106 cells. After cross-linking, lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2–4 μg of anti-Elk-1 or 2–4 μg of nonspecific IgG (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were collected, washed, eluted, and reverse-cross-linked as described previously (15.Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Eluted DNA was purified and used as a template for PCR. Primer sequences are given in supplemental Table S1A. Two-step quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using procedures and sets of primers described in the supplemental material. Expression levels of target mRNAs were normalized to Gapdh mRNA and expressed as fold change compared with the untreated control. Recently, we have shown that rat striatal mGluR5 can be expressed on nuclear membranes where it couples to Gq/11 and phosphatidylinositide-phospholipase C to generate inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-mediated release of Ca2+ via Ca2+ release channels in the nucleus (4.Jong Y.J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 14072-14083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have also shown the following: 1) agonists such as glutamate and the group 1 agonist, quisqualate (Quis), reach intracellular receptors via both sodium-dependent transporters and cystine/glutamate exchangers; 2) the group 1 ligand, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), does not compete with Quis or glutamate for uptake into the cell and therefore is a nontransported or impermeable agonist; and 3) the drugs LY393053 and LY367366 are nontransported, impermeable antagonists (4.Jong Y.J.

To ensure the specificity of nuclear mGluR5 responses and to extend these results to murine systems, we prepared striatal cultures from genotyped postnatal day 1 mouse pups derived from mating mice heterozygote for mGluR5. No mGluR5 immunoreactivity was seen in cultures prepared from mGluR5 null mice, although robust staining could be visualized in wild type (+/+) neurons on processes, intracellularly, and on the nuclear membrane (Fig. 1, A versus C). Because Quis would also activate AMPA receptors and mGluR1, it was bath-applied in the presence of 25 μm SYM2206, an AMPA receptor antagonist, and 20 μm CPCCOEt, an mGluR1 antagonist. Treatment under these conditions led to a rise in Ca2+ in both the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus in mGluR5+/+ cultures but not in null cultures (Fig. 1, B versus D). The same activation pattern was seen when Quis was perfused into cultures for short periods of time (supplemental Fig. S1A). The lack of Quis-mediated Ca2+ responses in null cultures shows that endogenous AMPA and/or N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors are not being activated (Fig. 1D). Moreover, bath application of 50 μm AMPA in the presence of SYM2206 did not activate intracellular Ca2+ in this system (supplemental Fig. S1B). Finally, the inclusion of 50 μm d-(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, a competitive N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor antagonist, did not affect Quis-mediated Ca2+ responses (supplemental Fig. S1C). Thus, Quis-mediated effects are specific for mGluR5. Quis-mediated Ca2+ changes consisted of two phases, an initial rapid rise followed by a sustained elevation (Fig. 1B). Both sets of responses were terminated by the addition of the permeable mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (Fig. 1B), whereas cultures preincubated with the nontransported antagonists, LY393053 (Fig. 1E) or LY367366 (data not shown), followed by Quis exhibited the sustained Ca2+ response pattern as cultures treated with Quis alone. In contrast, addition of the nontransported agonist, DHPG, to +/+ but not mGluR5 null cultures (supplemental Fig. S1H) led to a rapid transient Ca2+ peak, which returned to base line following MPEP application at the height of the peak (data not shown) or on its own, prior to MPEP addition (Fig. 1F). In keeping with the finding that LY393053 and LY367366 block extracellular receptors (4.Jong Y.J. Kumar V. Kingston A.E. Romano C. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30469-30480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5.Kumar V. Jong Y.J. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14072-14083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16.Kingston A.E. Griffey K. Johnson M.P. Chamberlain M.J. Kelly G. Tomlinson R. Wright R.A.

Lett. 2002; 330: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), bath application of either drug blocked DHPG responses (Fig. 1G and data not shown). Compiled results from multiple experiments assessing drug-induced changes of both the initial Ca2+ peak (supplemental Fig. S1D) and from responses at 300 s (Fig. 1H) revealed that Quis and DHPG generated unique Ca2+ responses that were specific for mGluR5. To rule out the possibility that Quis and DHPG had different affinities for receptors expressed on cell surface or intracellular membranes, inhibition of radiolabeled glutamate binding was tested using Quis or DHPG together with plasma membrane or nuclear membranes (supplemental Fig. S1, E and F). No significant differences were found between drugs or membrane sources (DHPGplasma membrane IC50 = 2.94 ± 1.71 μm; DHPGnuclei IC50 = 2.86 ± 1.23 μm versus Quisplasma membrane IC50 = 2.75 ± 1.47 μm; Quisnuclei IC50 = 1.56 ± 0.72 μm). These values are similar to those obtained by others (17.Klein J. Iovino M. Vakil M. Shinozaki H. Löffelholz K. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We also tested the striatal Ca2+ response for the endogenous ligand, glutamate in the presence of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor antagonist MK801, the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, and 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa(b)chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester. The glutamate response in +/+ cultures exhibited the same profile as that of Quis (supplemental Fig. S1G). Moreover, it was blocked by MPEP and completely absent in null cultures (supplemental Fig. S1, G and H). Thus, like Quis, glutamate activates both the cell surface and intracellular mGluR5. These data provide compelling proof as to the specificity of intracellular mGluR5-mediated Ca2+ signals and demonstrate that activation of cell surface versus intracellular receptors leads to spatially and temporally distinct Ca2+ responses. Among other things, agonist treatment of striatal mGluR5 results in ERK1/2, stress-activated protein kinase/JNK, and CaMKIV pathway activation (Fig. 2A) (18.Mao L. Yang L. Tang Q. Samdani S. Zhang G. Wang J.Q. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2741-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To determine whether differential receptor activation leads to differential signaling responses, we treated rat striatal cultures with different ligands and pathway inhibitors. Significantly, Quis alone or Quis in the presence of either nontransported antagonist, LY393053 or LY367366 (data not shown), up-regulated phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK) within 5 min of treatment, whereas pERK up-regulation was not observed with DHPG (Fig. 2, B and C). Quis-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation could be blocked by MPEP or the MEK inhibitor U0126 but not by the CaMKK inhibitor, STO609 (Fig. 2, B and C). A possible role for CaMK involvement in ERK1/2 activation was underscored by the general CaMK inhibitor, KN62 inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (data not shown), and the CaMKII inhibitor, KN93 partial inhibition (Fig. 2, B and C). Western blotting showed that at no time point did DHPG significantly activate ERK1/2, whereas Quis increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation for 15 min before declining back to base line (Fig. 2, D and E). mGluR5 activation is also associated with JNK and CaMK activation (13.Wang J.Q. Fibuch E.E. Mao L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Using both immunocytochemistry and Western blotting, we found that p38 MAPK exhibited no change in any condition (data not shown) and that phosphorylation of CaMKIV and JNK went up equally in response to either agonist (Fig. 3). Phospho-CaMKIV (pCaMKIV) was equally activated at 5 and 10 min by DHPG and Quis (Fig. 3, C and D), although the Quis response peaked later and declined more slowly (Fig. 3D). DHPG-mediated CaMKIV activation was blocked by MPEP, LY393053, KN62, and STO609 but not U0126 nor the CaMKII inhibitor KN93 (Fig. 3, A and B). Quis-mediated CaMKIV phosphorylation was essentially the same except that neither LY393053 nor LY367366 blocked Quis responses (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, ligand occupation of cell surface and intracellular receptors not only activates similar pathways (JNK and CaMKIV) but also unique signaling molecules such as ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Agonist stimulation of mGluR5 leads to the phosphorylation of several transcription factors, including CREB and Elk-1 (13.Wang J.Q. Fibuch E.E. Mao L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), hence we tested whether DHPG and Quis differentially increased Elk-1 phosphorylation (pElk-1) in striatal cultures. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, Quis but not DHPG stimulated an ∼8-fold increase in the number of mGluR5-positive neurons with detectable pElk-1 in the nucleus. This increase was entirely blocked by MPEP but not by LY393053 or LY367366 indicating that Elk-1 phosphorylation was due to intracellular receptor activation. Quis-mediated induction of Elk-1 was also apparent following Western blotting of treated striatal lysates (Fig. 4, C and D). Because Elk-1 can be phosphorylated by ERK1/2, JNK, and CaMK cascades (Fig. 2A), we used pathway inhibitors to determine whether there were any preferential responses. U0126 and KN62 completely blocked Elk-1 phosphorylation, whereas the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190, the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, the PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, or STO609 did not (Fig. 4, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). KN93 partially blocked Elk-1 activation (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas dnCaMKK, dnCaMKI, and dnCaMKIV did not (Fig. 4, E and F). Collectively, the most parsimonious model for these data is that a CaMKII/MEK/ERK1/2 cascade phosphorylates Elk-1 in response to signals originating from intracellular receptors versus those on the cell surface. In contrast to Elk-1 induction, significant up-regulation of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) could be observed within 15 min of either Quis or DHPG application (Fig. 5A). MPEP pretreatment blocked the effects of either drug, but LY393053 only blocked DHPG (Fig. 5A). Western blots confirmed equivalent agonist-mediated phosphorylation of CREB, which returned to base line by 2 h (Fig. 5, B and C). Although not significantly different from each other, Quis generated more intense CREB responses then did DHPG particularly between 10 and 60 min (Fig. 5D). Both STO609 and KN62 blocked agonist-mediated CREB phosphorylation, whereas U0126, SB202190, SP600125, KN93, or GF109203X had no effect (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S3A). Consistent with these data, dnCaMKK and dnCaMKIV blocked pCREB formation, whereas dnCaMKI did not (Fig. 5, D and E). These observations support the notion that mGluR5 receptors utilize a CaMKK/CaMKIV cascade to phosphorylate CREB. ERK1/2 does not appear to play a role in this system. Finally, pERK1/2, pCREB, and pElk-1 responses were specific to mGluR5-expressing neurons because striatal cultures derived from mGluR5 knock-out animals exhibited no response (supplemental Fig. S3B). The pharmacological inhibitors KN62 and KN93 support a role for Ca2+ signaling pathways being involved in intracellular mGluR5-mediated Elk-1 phosphorylation. Because these drugs also have off-target effects and as dnCaMKI, dnCaMKIV, and dnCaMKK did not block this process (Fig. 4, E and F), we directly tested the notion that CaMKII is involved. Use of an anti-phospho-CaMKII (pCaMKII) antibody showed robust activation of this kinase within 5 min of Quis but not DHPG treatment in either mGluR5-positive neurons and processes or in cell lysates prepared from striatal cultures (Fig. 6, A–D). The appearance of pCaMKII was blocked by MPEP but not by LY393053 indicating that intracellular receptors were involved in its activation (Fig. 6, A and B). Consistent with these data, dnCaMKII-EGFP expression in mGluR5-positive striatal neurons showed about a 50% decrease in Elk-1 phosphorylation compared with controls (Fig. 6, C and D, versus Fig. 4B), whereas mGluR5-activated pCREB was not blocked by dnCaMKII (Fig. 6, G and H, versus Fig. 5A). Taken together these data confirm that a CaMKII/MEK/ERK1/2 cascade phosphorylates Elk-1 in response to signals originating from intracellular receptors versus those on the cell surface. To test the hypothesis that nuclear Ca2+ is sufficient and not just necessary for phosphorylating the various signaling components activated by mGluR5 agonists, we isolated nuclei from postnatal 10 rat striata and directly tested whether Quis or DHPG application would lead to phosphorylation of ERK1/2, CaMKIV, and subsequently Elk-1 and CREB. Because DHPG cannot cross the membrane (4.Jong Y.J. Kumar V. Kingston A.E. Romano C. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30469-30480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5.Kumar V. Jong Y.J. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14072-14083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we predicted and indeed observed that DHPG treatment did not lead to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Elk-1, CaMKIV, or CREB, whereas Quis led to a direct 1.5–2-fold increase in all signaling molecules except for CaMKIV that could be blocked by MPEP, U0126, and KN62 (Fig. 7, A and B; and data not shown). Western blots of nuclei prepared from striatal tissue treated with DHPG or Quis confirmed that only Quis increased ERK1/2, CREB, and Elk-1 phosphorylation, a response that could be blocked by MPEP, U0126, and KN62 (Fig. 7, C and D; and data not shown). Taken together, these data reenforce the notion that nuclear Ca2+ is sufficient to induce ERK1/2, CREB, and Elk-1 phosphorylation in situ. To test whether Elk-1 phosphorylation is associated with gene activation, we determined whether the known Elk-1 targets c-fos and egr1 are affected by differential agonist treatment of striatal cultures. Both immediate early genes were increased following Quis treatment but not with DHPG, whereas c-jun, which lacks an Elk-1-binding site (19.Lavaur J. Bernard F. Trifilieff P. Pascoli V. Kappes V. Pagès C. Vanhoutte P. Caboche J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14448-14458Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), was not induced at any time point (Fig. 8A). A small but significant increase in egr1 RNA levels was seen after 2 h of DHPG treatment (Fig. 8A), although DHPG-mediated changes in egr1 promoter function were never seen (Fig. 8, B and C). Elk-1 up-regulates targets by binding to the so-called serum-response element (SRE) within the promoter of each gene. To determine whether Elk-1 phosphorylation leads to increased transcriptional activity, striatal cultures were transiently transfected with luciferase constructs containing the c-fos SRE (SREc-fos/luciferase) and the egr1 SRE (SREegr1/luciferase) (20.Chen C.C. Lee W.R. Safe S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because CREB phosphorylation is up-regulated equally in response to either drug (Fig. 5), we also tested a CREB-response element (CRE)/"

To explore the scope of regulation by stalling peptides and to better understand the mechanism of stalling, we identified and characterized new examples from random libraries. We created a genetic selection that ties the life of Escherichia coli cells to stalling at a specific site. This selection relies on the natural bacterial system that rescues arrested ribosomes. We altered transfer-messenger RNA, a key component of this rescue system, to direct the completion of a necessary protein if and only if stalling occurs. We identified three classes of stalling peptides: C-terminal Pro residues, SecM-like peptides, and the novel stalling sequence FXXYXIWPP. Like the leader peptides SecM and TnaC, the FXXYXIWPP peptide induces stalling efficiently by inhibiting peptidyl transfer. The nascent peptide exit tunnel and peptidyltransferase center are implicated in this stalling event, although mutations in the ribosome affect stalling on SecM and FXXYXIWPP differently. We conclude that ribosome stalling can be caused by numerous sequences and is more common than previously believed. Several nascent peptides stall ribosomes during their own translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Leader peptides that induce stalling can regulate downstream gene expression.

We conclude that ribosome stalling can be caused by numerous sequences and is more common than previously believed. The ribosome efficiently synthesizes an enormous diversity of peptide sequences without regard to their chemical properties. This generality is not universal, however. Several polypeptides interact with the ribosome to stall their own translation, either in the elongation or termination steps (1.Tenson T. Ehrenberg M.

In two well characterized examples from Escherichia coli, ribosome stalling on a leader peptide increases the expression of a gene further downstream on the same mRNA. The secretion monitor peptide SecM, for example, regulates secA in response to changes in protein translocation activity (7.Oliver D. Norman J. Sarker S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5240-5242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If translocation activity is low, ribosome stalling on the SecM peptide alters the secondary structure of the mRNA and up-regulates the translation of secA, a key component of the secretory machinery (8.Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). When activity is high, the signal recognition particle/SecYEGA system binds the signal peptide sequence in SecM and pulls it from the stalled ribosome (8.Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9.Butkus M.E. Prundeanu L.B. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6719-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A second example is the regulation of tnaA, a gene required to break down tryptophan, by the leader peptide TnaC in response to Trp levels. When Trp concentrations are high, ribosome stalling on TnaC blocks a transcriptional terminator upstream of tnaA, increasing its expression (10.Gong F. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1974-1983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11.Gong F. Yanofsky C. Science. 2002; 297: 1864-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Low tryptophan levels do not support ribosome stalling and lead to attenuation of the transcript. Stalling on the SecM and TnaC peptides is the result of three interactions: the binding of the nascent peptide to the exit tunnel and the peptidyltransferase center, and the binding of an effector in the ribosomal A site. The peptide exit tunnel in the large ribosomal subunit is 100 Å long and 15 Å wide on average (12.Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Mostly made of RNA, it provides very few hydrophobic surfaces for elongating proteins to bind, accounting for their ability to pass through unhindered. A significantly constricted portion of the tunnel is formed by loops in proteins L4 and L22 (13.Gabashvili I.S. Gregory S.T. Valle M. Grassucci R. Worbs M. Wahl M.C. Dahlberg A.E. Frank J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14.Berisio R. Schluenzen F. Harms J. Bashan A. Auerbach T. Baram D. Yonath A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). SecM and TnaC interact with the tunnel near this constriction, using critical Trp residues 10–12 amino acids upstream of the stalling site. Ribosomal mutations that reduce stalling map to the exit tunnel, implicating A751, A2058, and U2609 in the 23 S rRNA and specific residues in the L22 protein in the stalling mechanism (15.Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 16.Cruz-Vera L.R. Rajagopal S. Squires C. Yanofsky C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A cryo-electron microscopy study of the SecM-stalled ribosome revealed a network of conformational changes in 23 S rRNA emanating from the exit tunnel (17.Mitra K. Schaffitzel C. Fabiola F. Chapman M.S. Ban N. Frank J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nascent peptides also interact directly with the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) 2The abbreviations used are: PTCpeptidyltransferase centertmRNAtransfer-messenger RNAA siteribosomal aminoacyl-tRNA siteP siteribosomal peptidyl-tRNA siteMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSntnucleotide(s)GSTglutathione S-transferaseTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineKanRkanamycin resistance protein. to induce stalling. In the case of SecM, the identity of the final six residues is critical for stalling on the FXXXXWIXXXXGIRAGP166 sequence (15.Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Likewise, the C-terminal Pro residue in TnaC is essential for stalling on the sequence WXXXDXXXXXXXP* (11.Gong F. Yanofsky C. Science. 2002; 297: 1864-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These amino acids must be acting within the PTC to inhibit its catalytic activity, either peptidyl transfer for SecM or peptidyl hydrolysis for TnaC. In some cases, the peptide sequence in the PTC is sufficient to induce stalling without exit tunnel interactions. A C-terminal Pro residue in the YbeL protein inhibits termination. Peptide release is especially inefficient when Pro-Stop is preceded by an Asp, Glu, or Pro residue (18.Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). peptidyltransferase center transfer-messenger RNA ribosomal aminoacyl-tRNA site ribosomal peptidyl-tRNA site matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry tandem MS nucleotide(s) glutathione S-transferase N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine kanamycin resistance protein. In addition to nascent-peptide interactions with the exit tunnel and the PTC, stalling on SecM and TnaC requires a specific effector molecule to bind in the A site. This binding event is thought to create a PTC conformation that is inactive. For example, SecM stalls during elongation with unreacted Pro-tRNA bound in the A site (19.Garza-Sánchez F. Janssen B.D. Hayes C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34258-34268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20.Muto H. Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 545-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mutation of this Pro codon to Ala alleviates stalling. Likewise, TnaC stalling requires the binding of free tryptophan near the PTC (21.Cruz-Vera L.R. Gong M. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3598-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22.Cruz-Vera L.R. New A. Squires C. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3140-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The action of free tryptophan can be mimicked by Trp-tRNA if the tnaC stop codon is mutated to a Trp codon. Other aminoacyl-tRNAs (Phe, Met, and Pro) do not induce stalling on TnaC (11.Gong F. Yanofsky C. Science. 2002; 297: 1864-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although stalling peptides interact with the exit tunnel and PTC, they do so differently and share little sequence similarity. This led us to hypothesize that there are additional, unknown peptide sequences that might inhibit peptidyl transfer or hydrolysis. Here, we report the genetic identification and characterization of peptides that stall at high efficiency during elongation. The initial 18-nt library was created by amplifying the truncated kanR gene by PCR with the forward primer CATATGGCTAGCATGAGCCATATTCAACGGGAAAC and the degenerate reverse primer CGAAAGGGTACCN18ATTACCATATTTTTGAAAAAGCCGTTTCTG. 18 random nt (6 codons) were added to the 3′-end of kanR following residue 253. To create a second library lacking stop codons in codons four through six, the random region (N18) in the degenerate primer was replaced by (NNB)3N9, where B is a mix of C, G, and T phosphoramidites. The PCR products were cloned into pBAD-KT2 (23.Tanner D.R. Dewey J.D. Miller M.R. Buskirk A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10561-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with NheI and BamHI, and the resulting plasmids were amplified in DH10B. The libraries were then selected in X90 ssrA::cat as described (23.Tanner D.R. Dewey J.D. Miller M.R. Buskirk A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10561-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in media containing 15 μg/ml kanamycin at either 25 or 37 °C. The KanR fusion sequences from surviving colonies were amplified, sequenced, and recloned to verify their activities. The pGEX-3X vector was amplified with inverse PCR to create new restriction sites using the primers AGAGTAGCTAGCACGACCTTCGATCAGATCCG and AGAGTAGCATGCTTGACTGACGATCTGCCTCG. The library cassette was amplified by PCR from 12 residues upstream of the 6 random codons to the stop codon downstream, including the nucleotide sequence encoding SLQKRLFQKYGIXXXXXXGYRGSRVDRQAWLFWRMREDFQPDTD*, using the primers AGAGTAGCTAGCTCATTACAGAAACGGCTTTTTC and AGAGTAGCATGCTTTAATCTGTATCAGGCTGAAAATC. The resulting PCR products were digested with NheI and SphI and ligated to create the pGEX-WPPPSI, WPPDV*, and WPPWYR vectors. These plasmids and pCH201 (expressing tmRNA-H encoding a His6 tag (24.Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3440-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)) were introduced into X-90 ssrA::cat. Cultures were grown to mid-log phase and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2.5 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed in B-PER reagent (Thermo Scientific), and the cell lysate was cleared in an SS-34 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. His-tagged GST was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin from the supernatant. 50 μg of protein was acetone-precipitated and digested with trypsin for 14 h at 37 °C. Tryptic fragments were purified again in a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry, and the peptides were loaded onto a reversed-phase ZipTip column, spotted onto a MALDI plate, and overlaid with an alpha-CHC matrix (Agilent Technology). Samples were analyzed with a QSTAR Pulsar QqTOF mass spectrometer. Ala mutations were introduced by PCR into the pGEX-WPPPSI vector described above. X-90 ssrA::cat cells were transformed with a GST vector together with pCH201 (expressing tmRNA-H). Overnight cultures were diluted to A600 of 0.1, grown to A600 = 0.5, induced for 2 h with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and pelleted. The pellets were resuspended, lysed in SDS-lysis buffer, and quantitated. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed with mouse anti-His6 and rabbit anti-GST antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) as detected by fluorescently labeled anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (LICOR Biosciences). Images were taken on a LICOR Odyssey IR scanner. Templates were prepared by PCR with the following primers: CTGTACATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATTTTATAAGGAGGAAAAAATATGCAGGGCTGGCAAGCCAC and GGTTATAATGAATTTTGCTTATTAACCAGCCAAGCTTGCCGGTC, adding the T7 promoter and a binding site for the NV1 primer. The PURExpress cell-free transcription-translation system (New England Biolabs) was used for in vitro protein synthesis. Briefly, a 0.2-pmol template was combined on ice with 2.5 μl of Solution A and 1 μl of Solution B along with either 0.5 μl of DMSO (5%) or thiostrepton (0.5 mm in 5% DMSO), and then the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 1 pmol of [32P]ATP-labeled NV1 primer (GGTTATAATGAATTTTGCTTATTAAC) was added, and reverse transcription was performed as described before (25.Vazquez-Laslop N. Thum C. Mankin A.S. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 190-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Samples were then extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, separated by 6% denaturing PAGE with C and G sequencing lanes, and visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To detect peptidyl-tRNA in stalled complexes, [35S]Met was added to the translation reactions. Samples were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and visualized with a PhosphorImager. The reporter plasmid was created by inserting the WPPPSI stalling sequence plus 12 upstream residues after the ninth codon of full-length lacZ (derived from pNH122 (15.Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar)). The SecM sequence FSTPVWISQAQGIRAGP was used as a control. Cells bearing a lacZ plasmid and a ribosomal mutant plasmid were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-xgalactopyranoside at mid-log phase and analyzed for β-galactosidase activity using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside as described before (26.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). We set out to systematically identify peptide sequences like SecM and TnaC that interfere with peptidyl transfer or hydrolysis and induce ribosome stalling. To identify stalling peptides from random libraries, we modified a genetic selection that we previously developed to link ribosome stalling and rescue to the life of the cell (23.Tanner D.R. Dewey J.D. Miller M.R. Buskirk A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10561-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this selection, stalled ribosomes are recognized by transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), a small, stable RNA found in eubacteria and a key component of a quality control system for protein synthesis (for a review, see Ref. 27.Moore S.D. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The natural function of tmRNA is to release stalled ribosomes and tag the aborted nascent peptide for destruction. Acting as a transfer RNA, tmRNA enters the empty A site of the ribosome and adds Ala to the nascent polypeptide chain. tmRNA then serves as a template, encoding a short peptide tag that is recognized by cellular proteases. After this tag is translated, the ribosome is released at a stop codon within tmRNA, and the aborted protein product is degraded. For the purposes of our selection, it is important to note that, although tmRNA was first characterized as rescuing ribosomes stalled on mRNAs lacking stop codons (28.Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), it can also act on ribosomes stalled by nascent peptides (18.Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29.Sunohara T. Jojima K. Tagami H. Inada T. Aiba H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15368-15375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To create a genetic selection for ribosome stalling based on this ribosome rescue machinery, we altered tmRNA so that, instead of tagging proteins for proteolysis, it completes the synthesis of an essential protein, linking stalling to the life of the cell (Fig. 1). The kanamycin resistance protein (KanR) from Tn10 has a C-terminal helix of 15 amino acids that is structurally critical (30.Nurizzo D. Shewry S.C. Perlin M.H. Brown S.A. Dholakia J.N. Fuchs R.L. Deva T. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); truncation of this helix leads to loss of activity. To complement the truncated KanR protein, we changed the tmRNA template to encode the last 14 residues of KanR (ANKLQFHMLDEFF), referred to hereafter as tmRNA-K1. Together with the Ala from aminoacylated-tmRNA, these residues complete the KanR protein and restore KanR activity but only if the ribosome stalls at exactly the right site. This serves as the basis for our selection: peptide sequences that stall the ribosome at the end of a truncated KanR protein can be easily identified in random libraries, because they recruit tmRNA, complete KanR, and confer resistance to kanamycin. How can stalling be induced at the end of the KanR protein without interfering with the final structure and activity of KanR? Two mutations, Asn255 → Glu and Asp257 → Opal, create a Glu-Pro-(Stop) sequence that induces stalling during translational termination in a kanR gene lacking the C-terminal helix. We previously showed that expression of this truncated kanR-EP construct and the altered tmRNA, tmRNA-K1, allows cells to survive equally well on selective (15 μg/ml kanamycin) or non-selective plates at 37 °C (23.Tanner D.R. Dewey J.D. Miller M.R. Buskirk A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10561-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, bacteria lacking the modified tmRNA-K1 gene survive at the rate of 5 colony forming units in 107 plated. These results demonstrate that the introduction of the Glu-Pro-Ala “scar” from the stalling and tagging process does not destroy KanR activity. Analysis of the crystal structure of the homologous Aph(3′)-IIa protein (30.Nurizzo D. Shewry S.C. Perlin M.H. Brown S.A. Dholakia J.N. Fuchs R.L. Deva T. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) suggests that the C-terminal helix in KanR is preceded by a surface-exposed loop of poorly conserved residues (Ile253 through Pro256). We anticipated that this loop region might tolerate a variety of sequences that induce stalling while maintaining robust KanR function. Nucleotide sequences that induce stalling and tagging were isolated from a randomized library fused to a truncated kanR gene. 18 amino acids were deleted from KanR, including the C-terminal helix and 3 residues in the preceding loop. 18 random nucleotides (6 codons) were cloned downstream of this truncated kanR gene, beginning with residue 254. No stop codon was specified. We generated a library of 5 × 106 mutants and introduced it, together with tmRNA-K1, into an E. coli strain lacking wild-type tmRNA. We selected the mutants for survival on plates containing 15 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C. Roughly 1 in 104 colonies survived, suggesting that a substantial fraction of the sequences induce ribosome stalling. Although we were interested primarily in peptides that induce stalling, our selection identifies any nucleic acid sequences that elicit tagging by tmRNA. In principle, nucleotide sequences containing rare codon clusters (31.Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4579-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 32.Li X. Hirano R. Tagami H. Aiba H. RNA. 2006; 12: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), secondary structures, transcriptional terminators (28.Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), or other novel mechanisms might also survive the KanR selection. Analysis of the surviving clones, however, revealed sequences that share common features at the amino acid level. These were grouped into three classes (Table 1).TABLE 1Stalling peptides isolated from the KanR selectionClass I: Pro-stopG I S E P * (opal)G I K D P * (amber)G I W P P * (opal)Class II: Pro-ProG I R A P P H C G TG I R S P P N S G TG I L D P P G M G TClass III: Trp-Pro-ProG I W P P W Y R G TG I W P P D V * (opal)G I W P P P S I G T Open table in a new tab The most common cause of stalling, found in over 90% of the clones, is inefficient termination at the sequence Pro-Stop. The Pro residue is found almost exclusively at position three of the six random codons, corresponding to native KanR residue Pro256. Although there is no significant codon bias for any particular Pro codon, the opal stop codon (UGA) is highly overrepresented (23/29 clones). There is also selection for the residue just upstream of Pro-Stop: Glu is overrepresented (16/29) and Asp, Pro, and Gly are each seen several times in the −2 position. A second class of peptides must induce stalling during elongation, not termination. These clones contain two consecutive Pro codons, most commonly at codons three and four in the random sequence with no nearby stop codon. The majority of these clones were found by performing the selection at lower stringency, lowering the temperature to 25 °C. When tested individually, they showed poor survival at 37 °C, roughly 1–10%, much weaker than the 100% survival seen with the Pro-Stop sequences above. A third class of clones contains the sequence Trp-Pro-Pro without a nearby stop codon (Table 1). Like the other Pro-Pro sequences, these peptides also stall during elongation rather than termination. Unlike the second class of clones, however, where the two consecutive Pro codons appear at positions three and four, here they occur at positions two and three (e.g. WPPWYR). Another difference is that WPP-containing clones survive robustly (100%) in the KanR selection at 37 °C when characterized individually. Further experiments on these sequences are described below. The sequence Pro-Stop occurs commonly and elicits tagging at high levels; to prevent such clones from overwhelming other novel sequences, we created a second library of 18 nt (6 codons) in which codons 4 through 6 could not be stop codons. This was done by allowing only C, G, and A at the first nucleotide of these codons; this eliminates Phe, Tyr, Cys, and Trp as well. We screened an 8 × 106-member library at high stringency, obtaining colonies at rates of 0.01% survival. 21 of 23 sequenced clones contained the sequence WPPP at the first four positions (data not shown). This result confirms that WPP-containing sequences are robust inducers of stalling, particularly when coupled with a third Pro codon. Selection of this second library at low stringency yielded higher levels of survival (0.25%). Nearly all of surviving clones fall into the second class of stalling peptides, with two consecutive Pro codons at codons three and four of the random sequence. An alignment of 46 of these sequences reveals that Arg or His are strongly preferred at the first position, with Ala, Asp, Ser, and Pro at the second position (supplemental Fig. S1). Including the constant Gly-Ile upstream, the consensus sequence becomes GI(R/H)XPPXX. These appear to be weaker versions of the SecM C-terminal sequence GIRAGP. A clone closely resembling this sequence (GIRAPP) is more active than the other members of this class and survives the KanR assay 100% at high stringency. The peptide sequences in class three (containing WPP) show high levels of activity in the KanR assay and stall translation during the elongation step. We chose to further characterize three sequences: WPPPSI, WPPDV*, and WPPWYR. Where does stalling occur in these sequences? Where is the tag added by tmRNA? To analyze the tagged proteins by mass spectrometry, we first transferred the stalling sequence to the C terminus of the GST protein. This full-length, stable protein served as a scaffold enabling overexpression of the stalling peptide. Some of the KanR protein context was fused to GST as well, from 12 amino acids upstream of the random hexamer through the stop codon 27 amino acids downstream. To isolate proteins tagged by tmRNA, we used a modified tmRNA encoding 6 His residues in its template sequence (tmRNA-H). GST fusions tagged by tmRNA-H were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and digested with trypsin. From this tryptic digest, the C-terminal-tagged peptide was purified again with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The C-terminal peptide contains both the stall sequence from KanR and the tmRNA tag; determining its mass by MALDI-MS revealed the site of stalling and tagging by tmRNA. A single large peak in the mass spectra for the WPPPSI and WPPWYR C-terminal-tagged peptides corresponded to an m/z of 2041 (supplemental Fig. S2). This is the predicted result if the tmRNA tag is added after the second Pro (YGIWPPAANDH6D). The mass spectrum of the WPPDV* peptide fragment contained the same peak at 2041 together with a more abundant peak at 2255, corresponding to the peptide YGIWPPDVAANDH6D. In the WPPDV* clone, stalling occurs both after WPP and during termination at the stop codon. Peptide fingerprinting by tandem MS/MS was performed on all four of these peptides to confirm the amino acid sequence directly. The MS data indicate that tagging occurs immediately after WPP in these three clones. What amino acids cause this stalling event? In the case of SecM and TnaC, residues essential for the highest levels of stalling are found upstream and interact with the exit tunnel. For this reason we included 12 upstream amino acids (SLQKRLFQKYGI) from KanR along with the hexamers in making the GST fusions. To assay for stalling and tagging in the GST fusions, we detected the tag added by tmRNA-H with anti-His6 antibodies (Fig. 2). High levels of tagging were detected for the full-length GST-WPPPSI fusion, referred to hereafter as 1–18 (i.e. 12 residues from KanR followed by the hexamer (Fig. 2A)). Deletion of the first four amino acids had little or no effect (Fig. 2B, 5–18), but removal of the first eight nearly eliminated tagging (Fig. 2B, 9–18). We conclude that residues upstream of the WPPPSI sequence play a critical role in high efficiency tagging. Interestingly, some minimal activity resides in the hexamer sequence alone (Fig. 2B, 13–18) with no KanR upstream sequence. To identify how each residue contributes individually to stalling, we performed alanine scanning on the full-length stalling peptide, 1–18. Residues 1–16 were individually mutated to alanine and assayed by immunoblot (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the truncation results, mutating residues 1–4 has little or no effect on tagging. Alanine substitutions for Arg5, Leu6, Gln8, and Lys9 likewise make little difference in the level of tagging. In contrast, mutation of Phe7, Tyr10, or Ile12, or the WPP sequence dramatically decreased tagging levels. Notably, tagging was also strongly reduced by the Pro16 → Ala mutation.

Vaccinia virus (VACV), a poxvirus used during the WHO smallpox vaccination campaign, has been involved in zoonotic infections in Brazilian rural areas (Bovine Vaccinia outbreaks - BV), affecting dairy cattle and milkers. Little is known about VACV's natural hosts and its epidemiological and ecological characteristics. Although VACV was isolated and/or serologically detected in Brazilian wild animals, the link between wildlife and farms has not yet been elucidated.In this study, we describe for the first time, to our knowledge, the isolation of a VACV (Mariana virus - MARV) from a mouse during a BV outbreak. Genetic data, in association with biological assays, showed that this isolate was the same etiological agent causing exanthematic lesions observed in the cattle and human inhabitants of a particular BV-affected area. Phylogenetic analysis grouped MARV with other VACV isolated during BV outbreaks.These data provide new biological and epidemiological information on VACV and lead to an interesting question: could peridomestic rodents be the link between wildlife and BV outbreaks?"
https://openalex.org/W2033669284,"Background During zebrafish embryogenesis, microRNA (miRNA) miR-430 contributes to restrict Nanos1 and TDRD7 to primordial germ cells (PGCs) by inducing mRNA deadenylation, mRNA degradation, and translational repression of nanos1 and tdrd7 mRNAs in somatic cells. The nanos1 and tdrd7 3′UTRs include cis-acting elements that allow activity in PGCs even in the presence of miRNA-mediated repression. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a GFP reporter mRNA that was fused with tdrd7 3′UTR, we show that a germline-specific RNA-binding protein DAZ-like (DAZL) can relieve the miR-430-mediated repression of tdrd7 mRNA by inducing poly(A) tail elongation (polyadenylation) in zebrafish. We also show that DAZL enhances protein synthesis via the 3′UTR of dazl mRNA, another germline mRNA targeted by miR-430. Conclusions/Significance Our present study indicated that DAZL acts as an “anti-miRNA factor” during vertebrate germ cell development. Our data also suggested that miRNA-mediated regulation can be modulated on specific target mRNAs through the poly(A) tail control."

Shotgun lipidomics demonstrated multiple alterations in hippocampal lipid metabolism in iPLA(2)gamma(-/-) mice including: 1) a markedly elevated hippocampal cardiolipin content with an altered molecular species composition characterized by a shift to shorter chain length molecular species; 2) alterations in both choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, including a decreased plasmenylethanolamine content; 3) increased oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine molecular species; and 4) an increased content of ceramides. Electron microscopic examination demonstrated the presence of enlarged heteromorphic lamellar structures undergoing degeneration accompanied by the presence of ubiquitin positive spheroid inclusion bodies. Purification of these enlarged heteromorphic lamellar structures by buoyant density centrifugation and subsequent SDS-PAGE and proteomics identified them as degenerating mitochondria. Collectively, these results identify the obligatory role of iPLA(2)gamma in neuronal mitochondrial lipid metabolism and membrane structure demonstrating that iPLA(2)gamma loss of function results in a mitochondrial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degenerating mitochondria, autophagy, and cognitive dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W2031738820,"The Rheb1 and Rheb2 small GTPases and their effector mTOR are aberrantly activated in human cancer and are attractive targets for anti-cancer drug discovery. Rheb is targeted to endomembranes via its C-terminal CAAX (C=cysteine, A=aliphatic, X=terminal amino acid) motif, a substrate for posttranslational modification by a farnesyl isoprenoid. After farnesylation, Rheb undergoes two additional CAAX-signaled processing steps, Ras converting enzyme 1 (Rce1)-catalyzed cleavage of the AAX residues and isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt)-mediated carboxylmethylation of the farnesylated cysteine. However, whether these postprenylation processing steps are required for Rheb signaling through mTOR is not known. We found that Rheb1 and Rheb2 localize primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. We determined that Icmt and Rce1 processing is required for Rheb localization, but is dispensable for Rheb-induced activation of the mTOR substrate p70 S6 kinase (S6K). Finally, we evaluated whether farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) blocks Rheb localization and function. Surprisingly, FTS prevented S6K activation induced by a constitutively active mTOR mutant, indicating that FTS inhibits mTOR at a level downstream of Rheb. We conclude that inhibitors of Icmt and Rce1 will not block Rheb function, but FTS could be a promising treatment for Rheb- and mTOR-dependent cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1988469989,"The unwinding and priming activities of the bacteriophage T4 primosome, which consists of a hexameric helicase (gp41) translocating 5' to 3' and an oligomeric primase (gp61) synthesizing primers 5' to 3', have been investigated on DNA hairpins manipulated by a magnetic trap. We find that the T4 primosome continuously unwinds the DNA duplex while allowing for primer synthesis through a primosome disassembly mechanism or a new DNA looping mechanism. A fused gp61-gp41 primosome unwinds and primes DNA exclusively via the DNA looping mechanism. Other proteins within the replisome control the partitioning of these two mechanisms by disfavoring primosome disassembly, thereby increasing primase processivity. In contrast to T4, priming in bacteriophage T7 and Escherichia coli involves discrete pausing of the primosome and dissociation of the primase from the helicase, respectively. Thus nature appears to use several strategies to couple the disparate helicase and primase activities within primosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2072529945,"In mammals, germ cells within the developing gonad follow a sexually dimorphic pathway. Germ cells in the murine ovary enter meiotic prophase during embryogenesis, whereas germ cells in the embryonic testis arrest in G0 of mitotic cell cycle and do not enter meiosis until after birth. In mice, retinoic acid (RA) signaling has been implicated in controlling entry into meiosis in germ cells, as meiosis in male embryonic germ cells is blocked by the activity of a RA-catabolizing enzyme, CYP26B1. However, the mechanisms regulating mitotic arrest in male germ cells are not well understood. Cyp26b1 expression in the testes begins in somatic cells at embryonic day (E) 11.5, prior to mitotic arrest, and persists throughout fetal development. Here, we show that Sertoli cell-specific loss of CYP26B1 activity between E15.5 and E16.5, several days after germ cell sex determination, causes male germ cells to exit from G0, re-enter the mitotic cell cycle and initiate meiotic prophase. These results suggest that male germ cells retain the developmental potential to differentiate in meiosis until at least at E15.5. CYP26B1 in Sertoli cells acts as a masculinizing factor to arrest male germ cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle and prevents them from entering meiosis, and thus is essential for the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of male germ cells during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2076490001,"The type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) regulates multiple aspects of malignancy and is the target of several drugs currently in clinical trials. Although the function of IGF1R in proliferation and survival is well studied, the regulation of metastasis by IGF1R is not as clearly delineated. Previous work showed that disruption of IGF1R signaling by overexpression of a dominant-negative IGF1R inhibited metastasis. To establish a clinically applicable approach to inhibition of metastasis by targeting IGF1R, we examined the effect of an inhibitory antibody against IGF1R, EM164 and its humanized version, AVE1642, on metastasis of cancer cells. EM164 and AVE1642 did not affect primary tumor growth of MDA-435A/LCC6 cells but inhibited metastasis of these cells. Consistent with this inhibition in the formation of metastatic nodules, disruption of IGF1R also resulted in a decreased number of circulating tumor cells in blood of tumor-bearing mice. Disruption of IGF1R with a dominant-negative construct or antibody inhibited invasion across Matrigel in vitro. When tumor cells were directly injected into the circulation through the lateral tail vein of mice, IGF1R disruption also resulted in significant reduction of pulmonary nodules, suggesting that regulation of invasion is not the only function of IGF1R signaling. Further, disruption of IGF1R rendered cells more susceptible to anoikis. Thus, IGF1R regulated metastasis independently of tumor growth. The multiple phenotypes regulated by IGF1R must be considered during development of this therapeutic strategy as inhibition of metastasis independent of inhibition of tumor growth is not easily assessed in phase II clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2006985224,"Mitophagy is an autophagic process that degrades mitochondria by an intracellular engulfment that leads to their delivery into the lumen of the cell's hydrolytic compartment, such as the lysosome in animal cells or the vacuole in yeast. It is hypothesized that such processes serve a quality control function to prevent or slow the accumulation of malfunctioning mitochondria, which are thought in turn to underlie central aspects of the aging process in eukaryotic organisms. We recently identified a conserved mitochondrial protein phosphatase homolog, Aup1, which is required for efficient stationary phase mitophagy in yeast. In the present report, we demonstrate that the retrograde signaling pathway (RTG) is defective in aup1Δ mutants. In agreement with a role for Aup1 in the regulation of the RTG pathway, we find that deletion of RTG3, a transcription factor that mediates the RTG response, causes a defect in stationary phase mitophagy and that deletion of AUP1 leads to changes in Rtg3 phosphorylation patterns under these conditions. In addition, we find that mitophagic conditions lead to induction of RTG pathway target genes in an Aup1-dependent fashion. Thus, our results suggest that the function of Aup1 in mitophagy could be explained through its regulation of Rtg3-dependent transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2052363176,"Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0, an antagonist of phytopathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of crop plants, elaborates and excretes several secondary metabolites with antibiotic properties. Their synthesis depends on three small RNAs (RsmX, RsmY, and RsmZ), whose expression is positively controlled by the GacS-GacA two-component system at high cell population densities. To find regulatory links between primary and secondary metabolism in P. fluorescens and in the related species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we searched for null mutations that affected central carbon metabolism as well as the expression of rsmY-gfp and rsmZ-gfp reporter constructs but without slowing down the growth rate in rich media. Mutation in the pycAB genes (for pyruvate carboxylase) led to down-regulation of rsmXYZ and secondary metabolism, whereas mutation in fumA (for a fumarase isoenzyme) resulted in up-regulation of the three small RNAs and secondary metabolism in the absence of detectable nutrient limitation. These effects required the GacS sensor kinase but not the accessory sensors RetS and LadS. An analysis of intracellular metabolites in P. fluorescens revealed a strong positive correlation between small RNA expression and the pools of 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, and fumarate. We conclude that Krebs cycle intermediates (already known to control GacA-dependent virulence factors in P. aeruginosa) exert a critical trigger function in secondary metabolism via the expression of GacA-dependent small RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2016295650,"Interindividual variation in DNA-methylation level is widespread in the human genome, despite its critical role in regulating gene expression. The nature of this variation, including its tissue-specific nature, and the role it may play in human phenotypic variation and disease is still poorly characterized. The placenta plays a critical role in regulating fetal growth and development in ways that have lifelong effects on health. To identify genes with a high degree of interindividual DNA methylation variation in the human placenta, we surveyed the human genome using the Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer panel targeting 1505 CpG sites of 807 genes. While many sites show a continuous pattern of methylation levels, WNT2, TUSC3 and EPHB4 were identified to have a polymorphic ""on-or-off"" pattern of DNA methylation variation at their promoter region which was confirmed by pyrosequencing. Methylation of these genes can be found in 7%-25% of over 100 placentas tested. The methylation state at the promoter of these genes is concordant with mRNA allelic expression. In three informative cases TUSC3 was observed to be methylated on the maternal allele, and it is thus possible this represents a polymorphically imprinted gene. Furthermore, TUSC3 promoter methylation showed evidence for association with preeclampsia. A biological significance of these methylation allelic polymorphisms (MAPs) to human placental diversity is further implied by their placental specificity and absence in mouse. An extended study of blood suggests that MAPs may also be found in other tissues, implicating their utility for tissue-specific association with complex disorders. The identification of such ""epipolymorphism"" in other tissues and their use in association studies, should improve our understanding of interindividual phenotypic variability and complex disease susceptibility."

With this background, we have investigated here the possibility that the GRASPs may selectively control the transport of neosynthesized C-valine cargos. To this end we have combined the two independent approaches of removing the C-TVM and interfering with the GRASP machinery. We provide biochemical and functional evidence that GRASP65 and GRASP55 bind directly to newly synthesized CD8α in a C-TVM-dependent fashion and show that the GRASPs control two sequential transport steps of CD8α from the ER into the Golgi complex.

The anti-GRASP65 polyclonal antibody was obtained through immunization against a fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and rat GRASP65 and affinity purified; the anti-GRASP55 polyclonal antibody was a kind gift of Dr. F. Barr. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from Sigma. Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Parental FRT cells were grown and transiently transfected as described in Ref. 23.Iodice L. Sarnataro S. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28920-28926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar. CHO and ldlG cells were grown at 34 °C as described previously (32.Vasile E. Perez T. Nakamura N. Krieger M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 254-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Stably expressing cells were obtained after transfection by selection in the presence of G418 (Invitrogen) and screening by indirect immunofluorescence. Propagation of the VSV ts-045 strain and infection were performed as described previously (33.Bonatti S. Migliaccio G. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12590-12595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeling, preparation of cell extracts, and immunoprecipitation were all performed as reported previously (33.Bonatti S. Migliaccio G. Simons K. J. Biol.

In the two-step immunoprecipitation experiments on radiolabeled cell extracts after the first round of immunoprecipitation with the antibody (anti-GRASP65 or anti-GRASP55), samples were boiled for 15 min in denaturation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% SDS), subsequently the buffer was adjusted to 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton, and CD8 was immunoprecipitated using the folding-insensitive N1-anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (33.Bonatti S. Migliaccio G. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12590-12595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown on glass coverslips and treated for indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (34.Mottola G. Jourdan N. Castaldo G. Malagolini N. Lahm A. Serafini-Cessi F.

Image analysis was performed using Zeiss LSM 510 colocalization software. Immunoprecipitated samples were treated with 1,000 units of endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) as described previously (33.Bonatti S. Migliaccio G. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12590-12595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on linear 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, as described previously (33.Bonatti S. Migliaccio G. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12590-12595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were incubated overnight in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline), and then with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer, and finally with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After washing, the bound antibodies were detected by ECL. To quantify the relative amounts of the immunolabeled bands, different exposures of the blots were analyzed with the NIH Image program. Binding to the filters of 0.5 mm purified His fusion protein was carried out for 8 h at 4 °C, and the bound protein was detected with a polyclonal anti-His antibody and a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, as described above. Cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.4), washed in the same buffer, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were embedded in 10% gelatin, cooled in ice, and cut into 1-mm3 blocks, at 4 °C. The blocks were infused with 2.3 m sucrose at 4 °C for at least 2 h, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thick sections (50–60 nm) were cut at −120 °C using an Ultracut R/FCS (Leica, Milan, Italy) equipped with an antistatic device (Diatome, Fort Washington, PA) and a diamond knife. Ultrathin sections were picked up from a mixture of 1.8% methylcellulose and 2.3 m sucrose (1:1), as described previously (35.Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The cryosections were collected on formvar/carbon-coated slot copper grids and then incubated with different combinations of rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies, followed by protein-A-conjugated gold particles of different sizes (36.Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar). Double immunolabeling was performed as described previously (36.Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar), with optimal combinations of gold particle sizes. The siRNAs used were specific for human GRASP65 (NM_031899) and human GRASP55 (NM_015530) and consisted of a mixture of four siRNA duplexes selected using the Dharmacon SMART selection process and SMART pool algorithm. They were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). For RNA interference the COS7 cells were plated for 30% confluence in 24-well plates and transfected with 50 pmol of GRASP65 siRNAs using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the control, COS7 cells were treated with identical concentrations of transfectant. Forty-eight h after the initial siRNA treatment, the cells were processed directly for immunofluorescence microscopy or transfected with VSVG-based constructs, and kept for 16 h at 40 °C before the transport assays were performed. To perform a detailed study of the function of the CD8α C-TVM that we identified previously (23.Iodice L. Sarnataro S. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28920-28926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in cells transiently expressing CD8α, we isolated stable clones of FRT epithelial cells expressing CD8α and two C-terminal-mutated CD8α proteins, CD8α-ΔYV and CD8α-TL. CD8α-ΔYV is a truncated form of CD8α that lacks both the tyrosine at position −2 and the C-terminal valine (our previous work showed that the tyrosine residue plays no role in this C-TVM (23.Iodice L. Sarnataro S. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28920-28926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). The CD8α-TL mutant lacks the entire C-terminal cytosolic tail of CD8α (28 residues) and is severely impaired in its progress along the entire secretory pathway (23.Iodice L. Sarnataro S. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28920-28926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); CD8α-TL was chosen as a negative control (Fig. 1a). Immunofluorescence analysis of the clones showed that, at steady state, CD8α is mostly present at the cell surface, whereas CD8α-ΔYV also accumulates in the ER, as indicated by labeling of the nuclear envelope. In contrast, the vast majority of CD8α-TL accumulates in the ER, and is not seen on the cell surface (Fig. 1b). As a glycoprotein, CD8α only has O-glycans and moves rapidly from the ER to the plasma membrane (t½ 30 min) (37.Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Migliaccio G. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9940-9947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its O-glycosylation occurs entirely in the Golgi complex and its initial and terminal glycosylation are spatially and temporally separate, occurring in the cis- and trans-Golgi, respectively. The non-glycosylated (CD8u), initially glycosylated (CD8i), and terminally glycosylated (CD8m) forms of CD8α have different electrophoretic mobilities on SDS-PAGE, thus allowing progression of CD8α along the secretory pathway to be monitored (37.Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Migliaccio G. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9940-9947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 30-min pulse with [35S]Cys/Met, about 30% of the newly synthesized CD8α WT was in the CD8u form, whereas the majority reached the Golgi complex and were converted to glycosylated CD8i and CD8m forms (Fig. 1c, left panel). In contrast, the CD8u form represented more than 70 and 80% of CD8α-ΔYV and CD8α-TL, respectively, confirming their slower ER-to-Golgi transport (Fig. 1c, left panel). In addition, pulse-chase labeling with [35S]Cys/Met showed very fast maturation of non-glycosylated CD8u and an initial transient increase of CD8i (Fig. 1c, upper right panel; CD8u disappearance t½ ∼12 min) (37.Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Migliaccio G. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9940-9947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in contrast, CD8α-ΔYV showed delayed glycosylation of CD8u (CD8u disappearance t½ ∼60 min) and a substantial disappearance of CD8i as a transient intermediate (Fig. 1c, lower right panel). Thus, the C-TVM promotes a fast and synchronous wave of transport of CD8α to the cis-Golgi (23.Iodice L. Sarnataro S. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28920-28926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To further test this hypothesis, a chimeric reporter protein was generated by joining the ectomembrane and transmembrane domains of the temperature-sensitive VSVG (38.Gallione C.J. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 374-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the cytosolic domain of the CD8α glycoprotein. This reporter should have characteristics of both the viral protein and CD8α: (i) a reversible temperature-sensitive phenotype that causes misfolding and retention of VSVG in the ER at the non-permissive temperature, and its correct folding and exit from the ER upon a shift to the permissive temperature; and (ii) the C-TVM-dependent rapid transport to the Golgi complex of CD8α. Therefore this chimeric reporter protein should allow morphological analysis of its transport. Two forms of the chimera were generated: one with the wild-type cytosolic tail of CD8α, and the other with this tail but without the terminal tyrosine and valine residues (VSVG-CD8α and VSVG-CD8α-ΔYV, respectively; Fig. 1d). Both of these were expressed by transfection in COS7 cells incubated at 40 °C. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed that at this temperature, both chimeric forms of VSVG were retained in the ER (Fig. 1e). Upon shifting the temperature to 32 °C, VSVG-CD8α moved quickly to the Golgi complex and then to the plasma membrane, whereas VSVG-CD8α-ΔYV showed accumulation in the ER and a clear delay in its transport to the Golgi complex and plasma membrane (Fig. 1e). The rate of ER-to-Golgi complex transport of specific cargo proteins has been proposed to be stimulated by selective recruitment to ER exit sites (ERES) via a direct or indirect interaction of the cargo with a COPII coat (24.Nufer O. Guldbrandsen S. Degen M. Kappeler F. Paccaud J.P. Tani K. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 619-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Kuehn M.J. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 40.Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 41.Saito K. Chen M. Bard F. Chen S. Zhou H. Woodley D. Polischuk R. Schekman R. Malhotra V. Cell. 2009; 136: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether the C-TVM of CD8α has a role in driving the cargo concentration at the ERES. As a readout for a possible involvement of the C-TVM of CD8α in this process, we considered the subcellular distribution of VSVG-CD8α at 10 °C, a temperature at which COPII components are recruited to the ERES, but where fissioning of the nascent carrier is blocked (42.Lotti L.V. Torrisi M.R. Erra M.C. Bonatti S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 43.Mezzacasa A. Helenius A. Traffic. 2002; 3: 833-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44.Ronchi P. Colombo S. Francolini M. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, cargo proteins that can directly interact with COPII components, such as VSVG (which has a COPII-binding DXE di-acidic motif), appear concentrated at the ERES (43.Mezzacasa A. Helenius A. Traffic. 2002; 3: 833-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a). As shown in Fig. 2a, VSVG-CD8α showed reduced accumulation at the ERES at 10 °C as compared with the parental VSVG, with a distribution similar to that seen for negative control of the VSVG (VSVG-AXA), in which the di-acidic motif has been mutated (40.Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). VSVG-CD8α-ΔYV also showed reduced accumulation at the ERES at 10 °C, with a distribution very similar to VSVG-CD8α. As these data indicated that the C-TVM of CD8α does not promote concentration at the ERES, we asked whether this anterograde signal had a role in a subsequent transport step. To this end, we followed the transport of these chimeras at 15 °C, a condition that leads to the accumulation of cargo proteins in the IC (42.Lotti L.V. Torrisi M.R. Erra M.C. Bonatti S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here, with ERGIC-53 used as a marker for the IC, VSVG-CD8α and VSVG showed strong accumulation in the IC (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the C-terminal mutant forms VSVG-CD8α-ΔYV and VSVG-AXA showed little IC co-localization, with an overall ER labeling pattern similar to that seen at 10 °C (Fig. 2b, compare with Fig. 2a). Together, these results suggest that the C-TVM of CD8α promotes a transport step subsequent to cargo recruitment to the ERES and that it fosters cargo entry or proceeds into the IC. CD8α interacts directly with GRASP65 and GRASP55 through the C-TVM. The requirement of the C-TVM (a PDZ binding motif) for rapid transport of CD8α and concentration at the IC prompted us to test whether GRASP65, which has PDZ domains and cycles between the Golgi complex and pre-Golgi compartments, including the IC, had any role in decoding the CD8α C-TVM, and through this, in controlling trafficking of CD8α. To this end, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 3a, endogenous GRASP65 co-immunoprecipitated with CD8α, but did not co-immunoprecipitate with CD8α-ΔYV, CD8α-TL, or in the control non-transfected parental FRT cells. Fig. 3a also shows that GM130, a well known interactor of GRASP65, co-immunoprecipitated with GRASP65 and CD8α; however, p115, an “indirect” interactor of GRASP65 (as it binds the GRASP65/GM130 complex through GM130 (45.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jämsä E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), was not co-immunoprecipitated with CD8α and was therefore not investigated further (data not shown) (23.Iodice L. Sarnataro S. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28920-28926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3b, not only GRASP65, but also GRASP55, which also contains PDZ domains, was co-immunoprecipitated with CD8α, but not with CD8α-ΔYV or CD8α-TL. In addition, the same specific GRASPs-CD8α interactions were revealed when immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-GRASPs antibody (see below). Of note, normal rates of transport of CD8α correlated with its binding to GRASP65, as tested by the concomitant rescue of GRASP binding and rapid transport induced by the readdition of a terminal valine to a CD8α mutant with a partially truncated cytosolic tail (Δ17+; Fig. 3c) (23.Iodice L. Sarnataro S. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28920-28926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether CD8α interacts directly with the GRASPs, far Western blotting assays were performed. The GST-tagged cytosolic tails of CD8α and CD8α-ΔYV, and GST alone, were analyzed by SDS-PAG"

Yet surprisingly, we have considered very little the contribution of the sexually dimorphic brain when thinking about disease etiology and the important influences of the neuroendocrine and immune systems in programming the CNS. Most neuropsychiatric diseases have a sex bias in their presentation, age of onset, or treatment response. Yet surprisingly, we have considered very little the contribution of the sexually dimorphic brain when thinking about disease etiology and the important influences of the neuroendocrine and immune systems in programming the CNS. “It's not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it”—Hans Selye But are those reactions dependent on our sex? The complex sexually dimorphic brain is an intricate puzzle from which we are piecing together similarities and differences between the sexes for disease onset, development, and progression. As many neuropsychiatric disorders have a sex bias, elucidation of what makes the male brain different from the female brain and when in development and maturation such sex differences are important may prove enlightening if we want to identify novel therapeutic targets and treatments. Sex differences are important to consider for both how the organism responds or copes with neuroendocrine or immune challenges to homeostasis, such as stress or infection, as well as for how such perturbations may then feed back to program long-term changes in future responses. This idea of a G × E × D (or how our Genes are affected by the Environment during Developmental periods) interaction has been a recent focal point of the National Institute for Mental Health and its Director, Thomas Insel. The identification of environmental programming effects on novel genes during sensitive and dynamic periods of brain development and maturation has greatly pushed forward our understanding of disease susceptibility. There is no doubt that sex factors into this equation, but its contribution at a mechanistic level has been greatly ignored. How can this be? With women presenting with affective disorders at two to three times the rate of men, with autism affecting four times as many boys as girls, and with schizophrenia and depression onset dramatically rising during the adolescent years when major sex differences in brain maturation occur, taking a closer look at why sex matters seems a question of fundamental importance. In the absence of gonadal hormones during the sensitive period, the default brain is female…well, almost. The effect of the perinatal testosterone surge is to masculinize the male brain. In the absence of this hormonal trigger, typical differences between sexually dimorphic nuclei will likely never develop. However, application of testosterone to a female during this organizational period or to a male outside this period produces a brain that is neither fully male nor female. Not surprisingly, our chromosomal sex can also contribute to brain development in a hormone-independent manner. Evidence supporting this idea has come from many studies, including Art Arnold's development of the four core genotype mice where the testis-determining SRY gene is autosomal, providing a novel tool with which the contribution of sex chromosome complement can be dissociated from gonadal sex to address important questions regarding sex differences (Arnold and Chen, 2009Arnold A.P. Chen X. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2009; 30: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The timing or “critical periods” of brain development demarcate points where the plastic brain undergoes dramatic changes that are distinctly feminine or masculine, with sexually dimorphic nuclei increasing or decreasing in size, synapse and glia numbers changing, and dendritic spines sprouting at a rapid rate. However, an aspect of disease mechanism that has been greatly overlooked is the examination of how these sex-specific states may present as a window of vulnerability, where the normal developmental trajectory becomes most susceptible to reprogramming. For instance, in both humans and rodents, portions of the limbic system that are involved in stress regulation and emotional affect undergo significant maturation during adolescence, where amygdala volume increases significantly more in boys, while hippocampal volume increases faster in girls. Interestingly, these same limbic and forebrain regions are extremely sensitive to stress (McEwen, 2005McEwen B.S. Metabolism. 2005; 54: 20-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Logic would follow that as glucocorticoids are potent modulators of synaptic function and plasticity, exposure to stressors during adolescence could shape these areas critical to emotionality in a sex-dependent manner (Goel and Bale, 2009Goel N. Bale T.L. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2009; 21: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, while studies have begun to focus on the long-term consequences of stress during adolescence as a predetermining factor in disease, sex-specificity for outcomes has not been included as a possible factor. As adolescence is a period of increased presentation of mental health disorders, it will be imperative to better identify and delineate these interactions between adolescent brain maturation, environmental influences, and sex. One example where these factors may come together to mediate brain dysfunction is the case of affective disorders. We have become increasingly aware that females are diagnosed with affective disorders at more than twice the rate of males, while we still know astonishingly little regarding potential mechanisms underlying such sex differences. Clinical studies have pinpointed stress sensitivity or stress pathway dysregulation as a strong risk factor in affective disorder onset and susceptibility. Notably, in both humans and rodents, females show a postpubertal increase in stress response magnitude and a more prolonged stress recovery time compared to males. Orchestration of the stress response and recovery can be influenced by a host of neuroendocrine and immune factors and may have long-term consequences related to the future sensitivity and susceptibility of the organism. Therefore, the continued ability throughout life to appropriately respond to stress is a necessary aspect in homeostatic maintenance and disease prevention. Interestingly, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis, defined as inappropriate stress responsivity, be it too high or too low, is the most common and predictive physiological symptom in neuorpsychiatric disease. However, it is not yet clear whether changes in HPA axis hormones are a primary contributor or a secondary response to an as yet undetermined cause. Interestingly, there is a recent appreciation for the direct impact of the immune system on the stress axis and its potential involvement in stress-induced affective disorder onset and progression. Why is this important now? From early work by the famed endocrinologist Hans Selye, we have long understood the role that stress axis glucocorticoids play in dampening the immune system, and in more recent studies that within the brain these same steroid hormones can enhance immune function via direct actions on microglia (Sorrells et al., 2009Sorrells S.F. Caso J.R. Munhoz C.D. Sapolsky R.M. Neuron. 2009; 64 (this issue): 33-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar [this issue of Neuron]). However, as is often the case in organismal maintenance where endocrine system feedback works to promote homeostasis, the converse also rings true—proinflammatory cytokines and immune activation are potent stimulators of the HPA stress axis and are thought to function during chronic inflammation to promote cytokine-dependent glucocorticoid receptor resistance. More directly, cytokines also have an effect on promoting release of CRF, a likely candidate for many of the symptoms presented in affective disorders (Irwin and Miller, 2007Irwin M.R. Miller A.H. Brain Behav. Immun. 2007; 21: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Could there be sex differences in how the immune system interacts with these outcomes or in the link between inflammation and affective disorders? Certainly, there are well-examined immunosuppressive effects of the gonadal hormone rise during pregnancy, promoting a vulnerability of the pregnant host to infection (Butts and Sternberg, 2008Butts C.L. Sternberg E.M. Cell. Immunol. 2008; 252: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, less is understood at the cellular level as to specific innate sex differences in the ability of immune molecules to alter stress responsivity or influence affect. Interestingly, in a preponderance of human autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and lupus erythematosus, there is also a sex difference with greater prevalence in women. Here too, the neuroendocrine stress axis intersects with immune function, greatly exacerbating disease symptoms. Where do we begin for understanding the influence of neuroendocrine and immune systems on sex differences? If we first back up and examine how the sexually dimorphic brain develops, we find intriguing evidence in support of the immune system's influence on important sex differences even at the cellular level beginning very early in CNS development. Margaret McCarthy's laboratory has elegantly demonstrated in rats that brain masculinization by estrogen during the perinatal sensitive period occurs through prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms and can be blocked by a COX-2 inhibitor, supporting a critical role for neuroimmune signals in programming of the sexually dimorphic brain (Amateau and McCarthy, 2004Amateau S.K. McCarthy M.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). So, at a very early point in development we find evidence for a critical interaction between neuroendocrine-neuroimmune pathways that is involved in establishing sex differences. In addition to helping program the sexually dimorphic brain, the neuroimmune system also plays an important role in regulation of various neurotransmitters important in stress response throughout life. One example involves the kynurenine pathway and its potent stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines. In the brain, tryptophan is degraded by the cytokine-inducible enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO). Fluctuations of IDO activity following inflammation can have a direct effect on tryptophan availability and hence the amount of serotonin synthesized, which is clearly critical in maintenance of mental health and has been associated with the development of major depression and schizophrenia (Dantzer et al., 2008Dantzer R. O'Connor J.C. Freund G.G. Johnson R.W. Kelley K.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4155) Google Scholar). Since stress hormones also have direct actions on cytokine production via the glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor to induce IDO activity, the increased stress response and reduced recovery in females could further alter tryptophan metabolism and 5-HT availability. During stress experience, reduced 5-HT production is prohibitive to adaptive coping abilities and can greatly contribute to learned helplessness, where in humans such passive responses to stress are highly associated with the occurrence of depressive symptoms. Overall, there appear to be multitudes of paths in which fundamental sex differences beginning early in brain development, through dynamic periods of maturation and throughout life, can collide to push an organism into disease susceptibility. Clinically, understanding such sex-dependent mechanisms becomes important in diagnosis as well as in designing treatments with greater efficacy. As men and women are viewed as having a distinctly different brain development and maturation, then it would follow that one drug “size” would not fit all. For instance, we know that in women the acute phase of antidepressant therapy frequently increases anxiety rather than decreasing it. Further, if we factor in developmental timing, where adolescence is distinct from adulthood, SSRI treatments have been associated with an increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behavior. While little has been examined as to potential sex differences in these measures, based on the dynamic state of the adolescent brain it seems a necessary question to be addressed. Here again, we turn our attention to the importance of sex differences intersecting with developmental stages when determining disease outcome. While we now understand more about the importance of gonadal hormones, chromosomal sex, and the neuroimmune system in the “normal” programming of the sexually dimorphic brain, the potential for early life insults to alter this trajectory and its relevance to disease are less clear. Fetal antecedents, postnatal disturbances, or childhood trauma have increasingly been associated with long-term disease risk in depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and autism (Gardener et al., 2009Gardener H. Spiegelman D. Buka S.L. Br. J. Psychiatry. 2009; 195: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, Goel and Bale, 2009Goel N. Bale T.L. J.

However, despite an obvious sex bias in these diseases, surprisingly little has been examined as to how such early life experiences may alter perinatal or adolescent sexually dimorphic brain development and plasticity. Imaging studies in clinical evaluation of sex differences in affective disorders and schizophrenic patients have revealed dysregulation of the human neuroendocrine system with fetal antecedents coinciding with brain sexual differentiation (Goldstein, 2006Goldstein J.M. Horm. Behav. 2006; 50: 612-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and a disruption of the normal sexually dimorphic ratio of orbitofrontal cortex to amygdala in male schizophrenia patients (Gur et al., 2004Gur R.E.

Such clinical findings support the need to identify contributing factors in the disruption of “normal” sex differences related to neurodevelopmental disease susceptibility, be they insightful markers pointing to the timing of an insult or as an underlying mechanism of disease etiology. Insults that specifically occur during gestation have been highly associated with the development of schizophrenia and autism, where maternal stress or infection by way of increasing the proinflammatory response is thought to increase risk. Interestingly, playing right into the hypothesis that development of the sexually dimorphic brain may be involved, these diseases have been recently proposed as the hypo- or hypermasculinized brain in male patients, respectively. Studies in rodent models have examined the influence of prenatal stress on a range of sex-dependent outcomes, including hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and adult stress responsivity, illustrating the specificity of these outcomes to the timing of stress exposure across pregnancy (Mueller and Bale, 2008Mueller B.R. Bale T.L. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9055-9065Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, these studies support a likely feminization of males exposed to stress during early development, where spatial learning and memory, stress hormone responses, and physiological characteristics of stressed males show a pattern more similar to females. These studies suggest a possible disruption in the process of normal masculinization of the sexually dimorphic brain by maternal experience. Recent epidemiological studies found a similar association between maternal stress experience during the first trimester with an increased risk of schizophrenia in males (Khashan et al., 2008Khashan A.S. Abel K.M. McNamee R. Pedersen M.G. Webb R.T. Baker P.N. Kenny L.C. Mortensen P.B. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2008; 65: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). As the brain is less likely to be the direct target during this time, a candidate target tissue for mechanistic examination is the placenta, where influences of early gestational perturbations affecting developmental programming in humans and rodents may contribute to changes in maternal hormones or placental gene expression patterns impacting the developing embryo throughout gestation. It turns out that the placenta is actually sex specific, developing predominantly out of the embryo with less contribution from the mother. These data point to an exciting and novel involvement of chromosomal sex and a sex-specific interaction with the maternal hormonal milieu, inflammatory responses, and nutrient transport and growth support of the developing fetus. Focusing on early programming events in disease susceptibility leads us to an important mode of regulation that has yet to be tapped for sex differences—epigenetics. The recent surge of neuroscientists incorporating epigenetics into their research demonstrates a rethinking of disease etiology. Where our tunnel vision around genetic inheritance had been limited to DNA sequence and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, an appreciation has surfaced for the contribution made by the environment and experience as also heritable through DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and microRNAs. In animal models, epigenetic analyses have been applied to the examination of long-term outcomes and transgenerational effects of maternal care, diet, stress, or infection to identify specific genes associated with disease endophenotypes (Fagiolini et al., 2009Fagiolini M. Jensen C.L. Champagne F.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). While a great body of work has examined the critical role for DNA methylation in the imprinting essential for normal mammalian development, we know much less about how this machinery itself is regulated and what contribution to sex-dependent outcomes it might play. Intriguing sex differences exist in the expression patterns for the epigenetic machinery tied to regulating methylation and acetylation patterns. For instance, females typically have much greater levels of DNA methyl transferase enzymes and methyl-binding proteins in many tissues including the brain and placenta. Further, there are sex-chromosome-specific histone demethylases, Utx and Uty. How sex specificity in epigenetic machinery may relate to programming of the sexually dimorphic brain or potential differences in sex-biased disease is not clear but is likely again to point to developmental windows of vulnerability where gene targets could be identified. At the crossroads of the developing and maturing sexually dimorphic brain and the challenges that pose a potential deviation from this norm may lie the sex-specific programming events contributing toward disease susceptibility. Studies herein afford us a great opportunity to define disease mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets and prevention. The interaction of the neuroendocrine and immune systems with brain sex is an essential component of how the organism copes and maintains homeostasis where appropriate responses are necessary in short- and long-term disease prevention. These strategies are likely to be highly individual and dependent on a host of factors, with sex being a key contributor. We have many miles to go to fully dissect this enigmatic sexually dimorphic brain and the diverse points along its route of development and maturation where detours are likely to reprogram the final destination. Of clear importance in our continuing studies is the appropriate inclusion and evaluation of sex comparisons. Perhaps in solving this puzzle a critical additional piece to the timing and environmental equation needs to be G × E × D × S."
https://openalex.org/W2038902703,"Overexpression of the Ron receptor tyrosine kinase has recently been shown in a wide variety of human cancers. However, no studies have examined Ron receptor expression or function during prostate tumorigenesis. In this study we report that Ron is highly expressed in human prostate adenocarcinoma and metastatic lymph nodes when compared with normal prostate or benign prostate hyperplasia. Furthermore, we show that Ron is overexpressed in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines, and that the levels of angiogenic chemokines produced by prostate cancer cells positively correlate with Ron expression. The knockdown of Ron in PC-3 or DU145 cells results in a significant decrease in angiogenic chemokine production and is associated with a decreased activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Moreover, exogenous overexpression of Ron in LNCaP cells is sufficient to induce a significant increase in angiogenic chemokines that can be abrogated by inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling. Given that the function of angiogenic chemokines is important in the development of new blood vessels, we also examined the ability of Ron to modulate endothelial cell migration. Our data show that knockdown of Ron in prostate cancer cells results in significantly less endothelial cell chemotaxis when compared with Ron-expressing cells in vitro as well as in reduced tumor growth and decreased microvessel density after orthotopic transplantation into the prostate in vivo. In total, our data suggest that the Ron receptor is important in modulating prostate tumor growth by modulating angiogenic chemokine production and subsequent endothelial cell recruitment."

https://openalex.org/W2059763273,"Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) is an oncogenic transcription factor whose overexpression and nuclear localization is associated with tumor progression and drug resistance. Transcriptional activation of YB-1 in response to genotoxic stress is believed to occur in the cytoplasm through sequence-specific endoproteolytic cleavage by the 20S Proteasome, followed by nuclear translocation of cleaved YB-1. To study the proteolysis model, we developed a two-step affinity purification of endogenous YB-1 protein species and characterized the products using mass spectrometry. Whereas full-length YB-1 was readily identified, the smaller protein band thought to be activated YB-1 was identified as hnRNP A1. An antibody specific for YB-1 was generated, which revealed only one YB-1 species, even after genotoxic stress-induced nuclear YB-1 translocation. These findings warrant re-evaluation of the mechanism of YB-1 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. The relationship between nuclear YB-1 and tumor progression may also have to re-evaluated in some cases."

However, the native enzyme activity of PON was recently found to be as a lactonase (12.Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), suggesting that despite its known enzymatic promiscuity for other substrates including esters and phosphotriesters, its endogenous substrates are lactones. Importantly, all three PON family members have conserved their lactonase activity, but individual PON family members have widely disparate enzymatic activities toward other substrates. One specific lactone-containing molecule that PONs can degrade is the bacterial quorum-sensing molecule, N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) (13.Ozer E.A. Pezzulo A. Shih D.M. Chun C.

PON2 activity in airway epithelial cells may represent a novel antibacterial defense mechanism against invading pathogens that utilize acyl-homoserine lactones for quorum sensing and virulence regulation. Genetic variation in human genes can have a substantial impact on host responses, and SNP analysis may be used in anticipating responses and outcomes or in adjusting drug dosing. In this study we asked whether a common PON2 SNP, a serine to cysteine amino acid change at codon 311 in PON2 (2.Mochizuki H. Scherer S.W. Xi T. Nickle D.C. Majer M. Huizenga J.J. Tsui L.C. Prochazka M. Gene. 1998; 213: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), alters PON2 lactonase activity for 3OC12-HSL. This SNP is fairly common in the general population and is strongly conserved evolutionarily. We chose this PON2 SNP because PON2 has the greatest lactonase activity of PON family members, phylogenetic analysis suggests that PON2 is the oldest PON family member (11.Draganov D.I. La Du B.N. Naunyn. Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and several PON1 SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with PON2 SNPs. We found that recombinant PON2 Cys311 exhibits an impaired ability to inactivate 3OC12-HSL and that airway epithelial cells from humans homozygous for Cys/Cys at PON2 amino acid position 311 also have an impaired ability to degrade 3OC12-HSL. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used for transfection studies because these cells have no endogenous PON or lactonase activity (13.Ozer E.A. Pezzulo A. Shih D.M. Chun C. Furlong C. Lusis A.J. Greenberg E.P. Zabner J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 253: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). CHO cells were cultured as monolayers in plastic dishes and transfected with plasmids expressing hPON2 Cys311 or Ser311 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and allowed to express for 24–48 h. For epithelial cell lysate experiments, epithelia were first washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (containing calcium and magnesium), and then 50 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.9, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine) was added to the apical surface. After 20 min of rocking in lysis buffer at 4 °C, the cells were scraped free from the membrane with a pipette tip and lysed by sonication (10 pulses, pulse duration of ∼1 s) (Branson Sonifier 250, Danbury, CT). The cellular debris was cleared from the lysate by centrifugation (4500 × g for 30 s at 4 °C). The relative protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (500-0006). Lysate preparations (10–20%) were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (containing calcium and magnesium) and incubated in the presence of 3OC12-HSL (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC) at 37 °C. 3OC12-HSL in acidified ethyl acetate was dried under a nitrogen gas stream and then dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (containing calcium and magnesium) to achieve a final concentration of 10 μm 3OC12-HSL. At various time points, 6-μl aliquots were collected, added to 100 μl of ethyl acetate, and stored in airtight glass vials at −20 °C. 3OC12-HSL was obtained from RTI International. 3OC12-HSL was measured in a quantitative bioassay as previously described using Escherichia coli MG4 (pKDT17) (22.Pearson J.P. Gray K.M. Passador L. Tucker K.D. Eberhard A. Iglewski B.H. Greenberg E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). PON2 chemical deglycosylation was performed by first transfecting CHO cells with a plasmid expressing PON2 Cys311 or Ser311. 30 min later, tunicamycin was added to the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. 36–48 h later cell lysates were harvested, and SDS-PAGE was performed for PON2. Peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Sigma) digestion was performed according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, cell lysates were collected in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 138 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) and incubated with PNGase F (10 units) for 4 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by incubating at 100 °C for 5 min. Deglycosylation was then assessed with SDS-PAGE. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (Sigma) digestion was performed according to the manufacturer's directions. The cell lysates were incubated with reaction buffer and denaturation solution and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Following cooling of the sample, Endo H was added to the samples and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Digestion was then determined using SDS-PAGE. CHO cell lysates were made by incubation in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 138 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) with 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C on a rocker. The cells were scraped from the tissue culture plates and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Sonication was performed for 10 s, and cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 4,500 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. The lysates were then combined with loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked either overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The membranes were then incubated with the PON2 antibody (1:1000; rabbit, polyclonal anti-human PON2; Orbigen, San Diego, CA) for 2 h at room temperature and then washed three times in 1× TTBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm Tris, 0.05% Tween 20). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and used at 1:10,000 for 1 h. Following three washes with 1× TTBS, immunoreactive bands were detected with SuperSignal solution (Pierce) and exposed to film. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Stratagene QuikChange™ kit according to the manufacturer's standard protocol (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). Double-stranded DNA template was prepared by a standard megaprep protocol (Qiagen). Mutant strand synthesis was performed with the following primers for N226Q (5′-GATTCAGCAAATGGGATCCAGATTTCACCTGATGATAAG-3′), for N254Q (5′-GTTTTGGAAAAACACACTAATATGCAGTTAACTCAGTTGAAGG-3′), for N269Q (5′-TGGATACACTGGTGGATCAGTTATCTATTGATCCTTCC-3′), for N323Q (5′-ACTACAGTTTATGCCAACCAGGGGTCTGTTCTCCAAGG-3′), for N254A (5′-GTTTTGGAAAAACACACTAATATGGCTTTAACTCAGTTGAAGG-3′), and for N323A (5′-ACTACAGTTTATGCCAACGCTGGGTCTGTTCTCCAAGG-3′). The reaction products were then treated with the restriction endonuclease DpnI to enrich for multiply mutated single-stranded DNA. This reaction mixture was then transformed into XL10-Gold® Ultracompetent cells and spread on Luria-Bertani ampicillin agar plates (containing 80 ng/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and 20 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside). The colonies were picked, and site-specific mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (DNA Facility, University of Iowa). CHO cells were plated on collagen-coated four-well chamber slides and transfected with a plasmid encoding either human PON2 Cys311 or Ser311. At 36 h following transfection, the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in methanol, blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin in SuperBlock (Pierce), and stained with anti-human PON2 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Orbigen) and a monoclonal antibody specific for protein-disulfide isomerase to localize the endoplasmic reticulum (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI). Confocal images were acquired with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal system mounted on a Nikon E600 microscope. Primary human airway epithelial cells were isolated from the trachea and bronchi of human donor lungs. The isolated cells were seeded onto collagen-coated, semi-permeable membranes (0.6-cm2 Millicell-HA; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and grown at the air-liquid interface as previously described (23.Karp P.H. Moninger T. Weber S.P. Nesselhauf T.S. Launspach J. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Epithelial Cell Culture Protocols.in: Wise C. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 115-137Google Scholar). After genotypic identification of PON2 SNPs in donor fibroblasts, primary or passage 1 cryopreserved airway epithelial stocks were thawed and expanded for the described studies. All of the experiments were performed on well differentiated human airway epithelia (more than 14 days after seeding of cells). The samples were collected with the approval of the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. DNA samples were genotyped for the presence of several common coding and noncoding polymorphisms, including PON2 Cys311 → Ser. PCR primers for amplifying the sequences containing the SNP were designed using Primer 3. The PCR primers are listed in the supplemental materials. Sense and antisense probes used for fluorescence polarization-single base extension detection of SNPs were designed using Primer Premier. The sense and antisense probes for genotyping the PON2 Cys311 → Ser SNP are: 5′-CTG TAG TCA CTG TAG GCT TCT CA-3′ and 5′-CCG CAT CCA GAA CAT TCT AT-3′, respectively. Each genotyping reaction consisted of a polymerase chain reaction followed by a single base pair extension reaction using either the sense or antisense probe and dideoxynucleotides labeled with carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) or R110 for the alternative alleles. The fluorescence signal was detected by fluorescence polarization using the analyst HT (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and genotypes were determined based on the plot of TAMRA versus R110 signal values. All of the experiments were performed in at least triplicate, and the data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.). Comparisons between two groups were made with Student's t test. We cloned PON2 and asked whether mutating the 311 amino acid, from a serine to cysteine, would affect PON2 lactonase activity. Lysates from CHO cells expressing both PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 inactivated 3OC12-HSL over time, but PON2 Cys311 lysates had an impaired ability compared with PON2 Ser311 lysates (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that cysteine substitution at amino acid 311 impairs PON2 function through mechanisms other than alternative splicing, linkage disequilibrium, or promoter differences. To test whether the PON2 Cys311 variant expresses similar PON2 protein levels as PON2 Ser311, PON2 immunoblotting was performed in CHO cell lysates 48 h following transfection. Fig. 1B shows that in PON2 Cys311 samples we observed a single immunoreactive band migrating slightly higher than 37 kDa, a molecular mass consistent with PON2. In PON2 Ser311 samples, we also observed a similarly sized upper band as in PON2 Cys311, but noted an additional band with greater electrophoretic mobility several kDa lower than the upper PON2 band. Densitometric analysis and quantification showed no difference in total PON2 protein levels between PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 groups (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that the 311 amino acid change does not alter PON2 protein stability. The smaller, second band could result from alternative splicing (although this seems highly unlikely to occur using cDNA) (2.Mochizuki H. Scherer S.W. Xi T. Nickle D.C. Majer M. Huizenga J.J. Tsui L.C. Prochazka M. Gene. 1998; 213: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), from PON2 aggregation (24.Josse D. Ebel C. Stroebel D. Fontaine A. Borges F. Echalier A. Baud D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33386-33397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), or most likely from differential post-translational modification or proteolysis. PON2 has four putative N-linked glycosylation sites at asparagine residues. Purified PON1 is ∼15.8% carbohydrate by weight (25.Gan K.N. Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the glycosylation of PON2 and determine whether PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 are differentially glycosylated, we first expressed PON2 Cys311 or Ser311 in CHO cells and then treated with tunicamycin, an antibiotic from the bacterium Streptomyces iysosuperficus that inhibits GlcNAc phosphotransferase, one of the initial steps required for glycoprotein synthesis. Two days later, cell lysates were harvested, and Western blot analysis showed that, in PON2 Cys311 samples, the predominant immunoreactive band following tunicamycin treatment had a greater electrophoretic mobility compared with the PON2 band in untreated cells (Fig. 2A). This finding is consistent with N-linked core glycosylation of PON2. Similar findings were observed with PON2 Ser311 (Fig. 2B). After tunicamycin treatment there was no difference in the appearance of the PON2 band between Cys311 and Ser311 variants. This suggests that the lower band in PON2 Ser311 samples represents differential or incomplete glycosylation compared with the upper band in PON2 Cys311 and Ser311. Because tunicamycin has a number of effects on the cell including induction of the unfolded protein response, we also treated cell lysates with PNGase F at 48 h following transfection. PNGase F is an enzyme that cleaves N-linked glycoproteins between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues. N-Linked deglycosylation with PNGase F caused both PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 migration patterns to change as observed with tunicamycin treatment, and after PNGase F treatment there was no difference between the Cys and Ser variants (Fig. 2). PON2 was also sensitive to treatment with Endo H, an endoglycosidase that cleaves the chitobiose core of high mannose and oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins. When proteins are correctly processed through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, they become resistant to Endo H. Therefore sensitivity to Endo H indicates the presence of proteins that have not been processed beyond the ER. We observed qualitatively similar results when comparing Endo H, tunicamycin, and PNGase F treatments in both PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 samples (Fig. 2). From these results, we conclude that PON2 undergoes N-linked core glycosylation, and incomplete glycosylation is likely responsible for the additional band observed when PON2 Ser311 is expressed in CHO cells. Based on the two different bands of glycosylated PON2, we predicted that at least two of the four putative N-linked glycosylation sites are glycosylated in PON2. To determine which asparagine residues of the Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr) consensus sequence are N-glycosylated in PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 variants, putative N-linked glycosylation sites were disrupted by substituting glutamine for asparagine individually and also in combination (quadruple mutant). Western blotting for PON2 revealed one immunoreactive band in wild-type PON2 Cys311 and the N226Q and N269Q mutants. Cell lysates from the N254Q and N323Q mutants also showed one PON2 immunoreactive band, but with a greater electrophoretic mobility than wild-type PON2 Cys311 (Fig. 3A). Lysate from the quad mutant had a PON2 immunoreactive band with a smaller molecular mass than either N254Q or N323Q. This shows that, for PON2 Cys311, two of the four putative N-linked glycosylation sites undergo oligosaccharide addition: asparagine residues 254 and 323. We next hypothesized that the upper band in PON2 Ser311 also represents glycosylation at both asparagine 254 and 323, whereas the lower electrophoretic mobility band could be glycosylation at either one of these asparagine residues or a mixture of individually glycosylated PON2 proteins. Alternatively, PON2 Ser311 could use different asparagine residues for core glycosylation. Similar to the PON2 Cys311, only asparagine 254 and 323 were glycosylated (Fig. 3B). The immunoreactive band in both PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 quad mutants had a similar molecular mass compared with PON2 treated with PNGase F or Endo H (Fig. 3, C and D). These substitution experiments allowed us to investigate which site is glycosylated in the lower band of PON2 Ser311. The N254Q mutant had an unglycosylated band as well as an intermediate glycosylated band, suggesting that the lower PON2 Ser311 band is glycosylated at asparagine 254. This is confirmed by the finding that the N323Q substitution results in a single intermediate band (Fig. 3B). Substitution at asparagine 323 caused loss of the upper band, but the lower band remained in place. These data show that the upper band in PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 is glycosylated at asparagine 254 and 323, whereas the lower band in PON2 Ser311 is only glycosylated at asparagine 254. We hypothesized that differential glycosylation of PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 accounts for the differences in lactonase activity between the 311 variants, so we initially asked whether glycosylation is important for PON2 inactivation of 3OC12-HSL. Lysates from CHO cells transfected with the PON2 Cys311 or Ser311 with the N254G mutation had preserved 3OC12-HSL lactonase activity (Fig. 4, A and B). We expected that if the lower electrophoretic band, only glycosylated at asparagine 254, in wild-type PON2 Ser311 accounts for its enhanced 3OC12-HSL inactivation, then glycosylation at asparagine 323 must inhibit PON2 lactonase activity. In contrast, we found that the N323Q mutant had impaired lactonase activity, showing that glycosylation at asparagine 323 is important for PON2 function. Similarly, lysates from CHO cells transfected with the PON2 Cys311 or Ser311 quad mutant (N226Q/N254Q/N269Q/N323Q) were unable to degrade 3OC12-HSL, also showing that glycosylation might be important for PON2 3OC12-HSL inactivation. Mutation of asparagine residues to glutamine could have other effects on PON2 structure and activity besides disrupting N-linked glycosylation. Therefore, we constructed additional mutants of the PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 variants by replacing asparagine with alanine individually at positions 254 and 323, as well as a double mutant, N254A/N323A. Compared with the glutamine mutants, we found similar patterns of PON2 immunoreactive bands in the N254A, N323A, and N254A/N323A mutants (Fig. 4C). In addition, the N323A and N254A/N323A mutants had an impaired ability to inactivate 3OC12-HSL (Fig. 4, D and E). From these data we conclude that: 1) PON2 undergoes N-linked core glycosylation at asparagine residues 254 and 323; 2) the upper band in PON2 Ser311 is glycosylated at asparagine 254 and 323, whereas the lower band is only glycosylated at asparagine 254; 3) glycosylation at asparagine 323 is required for PON2 lactonase activity; and 4) differential glycosylation between the PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 variants does not account for greater lactonase activity by PON2 Ser311. Our data show that PON2 is Endo H-sensitive and does not undergo complex glycosylation, 4D. A. Stoltz, T. J. Recker, and J. Zabner, unpublished data. suggesting that PON2 resides in the ER. Moreover, recent work by Horke et al. (26.Horke S. Witte I. Wilgenbus P. Krüger M. Strand D. Förstermann U. Circulation. 2007; 115: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) demonstrated PON2 localization to the ER in endothelial cells. To test for changes in PON2 cellular localization as a mechanism of disrupted lactonase activity between PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 variants, immunohistochemical staining for PON2 was performed in CHO cells following transfection with either PON2 Cys311- or Ser311-expressing plasmids. A similar pattern of staining for both PON2 Cys311 and Ser311 was observed with the most intense staining corresponding to an ER location (Fig. 5). To test whether the PON2 311 SNP also affects lactonase activity in vivo, we asked whether naturally occurring PON2 mutations at position 311 would affect the ability of primary human airway epithelial cells to degrade 3OC12-HSL. We first isolated DNA from 200 human donor lung samples and performed genotyping by polymerase chain reaction allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization assays for the PON2 S311C polymorphism and a number of other common PON1, PON2, and PON3 allelic variants including coding (PON1 Q192R, PON1 L55M, PON3 C133A, and PON3 G99A) and promoter (PON1 G-907C) polymorphisms (supplemental Table S1). For PON2, we found that 62% of human donor samples were homozygous for Ser/Ser, 35% heterozygous for Ser/Cys, and 3% homozygous for Cys/Cys at amino acid 311 (Fig. 6A). These findings are consistent with the HapMAP-CEU European SNP data base showing 57% of individuals homozygous for Ser/Ser, 38% heterozygous for Ser/Cys, and 5% homozygous for Cys/Cys. To test whether differences in the common PON2 311 variant affect airway epithelia inactivation of 3OC12-HSL, human airway epithelial cells from four individuals homozygous for cysteine, five homozygous for serine, and two heterozygous for cysteine/serine at amino acid position 311 were grown at the air-liquid interface. We chose these donors based upon their PON2 311 SNP and similarities in other described SNPs for PON1 and PON3. Lysates from airway epithelial cells homozygous for serine degraded 3OC12-HSL with ∼25% active 3OC12-HSL remaining after 60 min of exposure (Fig. 6B). In contrast, airway epithelial cell samples from donors homozygous for cysteine had an impaired ability to inactivate 3OC12-HSL, and samples from heterozygotes (Ser/Cys) demonstrated an int"

However, other events occur prior to the initiation of apoptosis in cells. Because of the importance of mtDNA in ATP production and of ATP in fuel cell cycle progression, we asked whether mtDNA damage was an upstream signal leading to cell cycle arrest. Using quantitative alkaline Southern blot technology, we found that exposure to menadione produced detectable mtDNA damage in HeLa cells that correlated with an S phase cell cycle arrest. To determine whether mtDNA damage was causatively linked to the observed cell cycle arrest, experiments were performed utilizing a MTS-hOGG1-Tat fusion protein to target the hOGG1 repair enzyme to mitochondria and enhance mtDNA repair. The results revealed that the transduction of MTS-hOGG1-Tat into HeLa cells alleviated the cell cycle block following an oxidative insult. Furthermore, mechanistic studies showed that Chk2 phosphorylation was enhanced following menadione exposure. Treatment of the HeLa cells with the hOGG1 fusion protein prior to menadione exposure resulted in an increase in the rate of Chk2 dephosphorylation. These results strongly support a direct link between mtDNA damage and cell cycle arrest. Previous work from our laboratory has focused on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) repair and cellular viability.

Mitochondria are often described as the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation for cellular utilization. However, this process can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesBERbase excision repairHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneMNUN-methyl-N-nitrosoureaQAGEquantitative alkaline gel electrophoresisHAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered salineMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidATMataxia telangiectasia-mutatedERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseOGG8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylasehOGGhuman OGGMTSmitochondrial targeting sequence. as a result of electron leakage from the electron transport chain. It is estimated that 1–5% of the electrons from electron transport join with molecular oxygen to produce superoxide (1.Mandavilli B.S. Santos J.H. Van Houten B. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 2.Spiteller G. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 959: 30-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The superoxide molecule can then undergo dismutation, either spontaneously or aided by manganese superoxide dismutase, to form hydrogen peroxide. Although superoxide has a very short half-life, hydrogen peroxide is much more stable and can diffuse freely across membranes. Once hydrogen peroxide reacts with iron, it can undergo Fenton chemistry and produce the hydroxyl radical. Because the hydroxyl radical is so highly reactive, it reacts in close proximity to its production site. Because of the location of ROS production from electron transport in the mitochondrial inner membrane, mtDNA can become oxidatively damaged. Indeed, research has shown that mitochondrial DNA is a sensitive target for mitochondria-derived ROS production (3.Hollensworth S.B. Shen C. Sim J.E. Spitz D.R. Wilson G.L. LeDoux S.P. Free Radic.

The mammalian mitochondrion contains 2–10 copies of mtDNA, a circular double-stranded DNA molecule that encodes 13 proteins, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs (7.Wallace D.C. Gene. 2005; 354: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The integrity of the mtDNA must be maintained to ensure proper electron transport chain function. The repair of lesions in mtDNA is especially important because it has no introns and almost all of the mtDNA must be transcribed. Therefore, efficient repair of lesions in this DNA is essential to ensure that the mitochondria-encoded proteins for the respiratory chain are produced and that efficient electron transport is maintained. To ensure genomic stability and remove oxidative base lesions, mtDNA is repaired through base excision repair (BER), which requires a stepwise removal of the damaged base and its replacement with the correct base (1.Mandavilli B.S. Santos J.H. Van Houten B. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 8.Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. D'Errico M. Simonelli V. Dogliotti E.

However, there are changes in cellular function that can occur prior to the initiation of cell death to allow the cell to repair damage that it has sustained. One such example is the initiation of a cell cycle arrest. Because of the importance of mtDNA in ATP production and the production of ROS that can occur from aberrant electron transport, it is likely that mitochondria exert some level of control over cellular proliferation. Recent evidence supports the concept of a mitochondrial checkpoint (13.Singh K.K. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1067: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, our experiments explored whether a link exists between mtDNA integrity and the cell cycle. Experiments utilized menadione to produce ROS in HeLa cells to determine whether there is a link between mtDNA integrity and cell cycle arrest. mtDNA BER was modulated using a fusion protein containing human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (hOGG1) targeted to mitochondria to enhance mtDNA repair. The results show that mtDNA damage is linked to cell cycle arrest. HeLa cells and RCSN-3 cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5.0% CO2 in a humidified chamber. HeLa cells, a human cervical cancer cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mm glutamine (Sigma), and 100 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). RCSN-3 cells, a neuronal cell line derived from the substantia nigra of 4-month-old rat brains, were cultured in 1:1 F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Sigma), and 6.0 g/liter glucose (14.Martinez-Alvarado P.

In all experiments, cells were plated 24 h prior to the start of the experiment. For menadione exposure, menadione sodium bisulfite (Sigma) was dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Sigma) and diluted to the desired concentrations. The medium in the dishes was removed, cells were washed once in HBSS, and the HBSS containing menadione (or HBSS alone for control dishes) was added to the dishes for 1 h. Following the 1-h exposure, the menadione was removed, the dishes were washed once with HBSS, and the cells were either harvested for analysis immediately (e.g. mtDNA or nuclear DNA damage, etc.), or fresh medium was placed into the cell dishes for 24 h (e.g. cell cycle analysis, trypan blue dye exclusion viability, etc.). Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; Sigma) treatment followed the same protocol as for menadione, except that CCCP was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide prior to diluting into HBSS; control CCCP samples contained only dimethyl sulfoxide in HBSS. N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) treatment followed the same protocol as menadione, except that MNU was diluted into citrate buffer, pH 4.2, prior to dilution into HBSS. Control MNU samples contained only citrate buffer in HBSS, with a final citrate buffer concentration of 1%. Cells were plated into tissue culture vessels at a subconfluent density. Cells were allowed to grow for 24 h in normal medium prior to experimentation. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were exposed to varying concentrations of menadione following the exposure regimen described above. At the appropriate time, the cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended. An aliquot was taken from the cell suspension and mixed 1:1 with 0.4% trypan blue. Cells then were counted in a hemacytometer to determine the number of cells present. Viability was calculated, and proliferation was determined based on the sample collected at T = 0 h, the time that the chemical exposure began. Cells were plated and exposed to menadione as described above. At the appropriate time, cells were lysed in DNA lysis buffer (0.3 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science), 0.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. To each sample, 5 m NaCl was added to a final NaCl concentration of 1 m, and DNA was extracted twice with an equal volume of SEVAG (24:1, chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol). To the resulting aqueous layer, 10.5 m ammonium acetate was added to a final ammonium acetate concentration of 2.1 m. The samples were mixed by inversion; then twice the sample volume of 100% ice-cold ethanol was added to each sample and mixed by inversion, and the DNA was allowed to precipitate at −20 °C overnight. The precipitated samples then were pelleted and resuspended in distilled H2O, and the sample was treated with RNase (final concentration, 1.25 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science) and BamHI restriction enzyme (Roche Applied Science). The restriction was allowed to proceed for at least 6 h at 37 °C. Following restriction, samples were precipitated using 10.5 m ammonium acetate and 100% ice-cold ethanol at −20 °C overnight. The precipitated DNA samples were pelleted, resuspended in 1× TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and quantitated using calf thymus DNA as the standard in a Hoefer DyNA Quant 200 fluorometer and a Hoechst 33258 fluorescent solution. The quantitated total cellular DNA was heated to 70 °C for 15 min, cooled to room temperature for 10 min, and treated for 30 min with 5 units/μg endonuclease III and 5 units/μg formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (New England Biolabs). Then, NaOH was added to a final concentration of 0.1 n, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Alkaline loading dye (10 mm EDTA, 25% Ficoll, 0.25% bromcresol purple, 500 mm NaOH in H2O) was added to each sample, and the samples were loaded on a 0.6% alkaline-agarose gel (0.6% agarose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaOH) in alkaline running buffer (1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 45 mm NaOH). The gels ran for 16 h at 30 V (1.5 V/cm gel length). The resulting gel was stained with ethidium bromide and imaged using UV light to obtain a gel picture. The gel picture was saved, and the gel was then washed twice with 0.25 m HCl, twice with an alkaline wash (0.5 m NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl), and twice with neutral buffer (0.5 m Tris, 1.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5) for 10 min each. The gel was transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) using 10× SSC (1.5 m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate) and cross-linked using a GS Gene Linker UV chamber (Bio-Rad). The membrane was hybridized to a species-specific mitochondrial radioactive probe in 7% SDS, 0.25 m Na2HPO4 at 55 °C overnight. Following hybridization, the membrane was washed twice in 5% SDS, 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and twice in 1% SDS, 20 mm Na2HPO4 for 15 min each. The membrane was dried and placed on film for exposure and analysis. Film density was determined either by Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad) or using Fujifilm Image Gauge 4.0 software. Break frequencies were calculated using the Poisson equation, Bf = −ln(Po), where Bf is the number of breaks per fragment and Po is the fraction of fragments free of breaks. All results are shown as lesions per mitochondrial genome. Samples of the resulting Southern blot images are included in supplemental Fig. 1. The gel picture obtained during the quantitative alkaline Southern blotting procedure was scanned into a computer. The film was then analyzed using Fujifilm Image Gauge 4.0 software to determine the peak fluorescent intensity size, which represents the area of greatest intensity along the DNA sample lane. The location then was compared with the lambda band standard (Promega) to determine the size of the peak fluorescent intensity. Nuclear DNA damage causes a decrease in the fragment size of the peak fluorescent intensity compared with the control. Note that the DNA visualized by QAGE was treated enzymatically with formamidopyrimidine glycosylase and endonuclease III as described under “Quantitative Southern Blot Analysis” (“Experimental Procedures”). Samples of the resulting QAGE images are included in supplemental Fig. 1. HeLa cells exposed to menadione or CCCP were collected by trypsinization, pelleted, and resuspended at a concentration of 1 million cells/ml in serum-free medium. At this point, positive controls (previously untreated cells) were treated with 1 μl of 50 mm CCCP for 5 min at 37 °C (final concentration of 50 μm). To each sample, 6 μl of 200 μm JC-1 dye was added, and the samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Following incubation, cells were washed once with serum-free medium, pelleted, and resuspended in fresh serum-free medium. Samples were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry, with 10,000 events collected for each sample. ADP/ATP ratios were determined using the ApoSENSOR ADP/ATP ratio assay kit (Alexis Biochemicals). Cells were plated in 96-well dishes with 2 × 103 cells/well and allowed to grow for 24 h. Following the growth period, cells were treated with menadione or CCCP at varying concentrations and exposure times. Following chemical exposure, cells were lysed and analyzed using the protocol provided. ATP and ADP levels were determined using a reporter luminometer (Turner Designs), with ATP analysis preceding ADP analysis. The sequence for hOGG1-α was obtained and codon-optimized for efficient expression in Escherichia coli (GenScript Corp.). The MTS sequence is from human manganese superoxide dismutase and is 24 amino acids in length (17.Shimoda-Matsubayashi S. Matsumine H. Kobayashi T. Nakagawa-Hattori Y. Shimizu Y. Mizuno Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The C-terminal extension, HA-Tat-His10, was generated from synthetic oligonucleotides using an overlapping PCR technique. All components then were constructed together using overlapping PCR. The final construct (MTS-hOGG1-HA-Tat-10His) was assembled in the pBluescriptII (Stratagene) derivative vector, with the expression driven by the Plac promoter. This vector was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. The bacteria were grown in liquid culture at 15 °C for 42 h in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in purification buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (no EDTA), 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm imidazole). The bacterial suspension was sonicated for 15 s with 45 s in between using a Branson Sonifier 250. Sonication was repeated five times. The bacterial lysates were then centrifuged at 22,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The clear lysates were mixed with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose suspension (Qiagen) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a slow orbital shaker. A polystyrene column was prepared for the lysate suspension, and the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column that was formed was washed with 2–3 volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol). A sample of the flow-through was taken for the absorbance measurement using a spectrophotometer, with an A280 of <0.05 obtained before the elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 300 mm imidazole) was applied. Once the A value was obtained, the elution buffer was applied, and timed fractions of eluting protein were collected from the column in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The protein obtained then was desalted to remove imidazole using a desalting buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol), and the protein was concentrated. The amount of protein was measured using a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad SmartSpec 3000), the purity of the eluted protein was assessed using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and a Western blot was performed to confirm the correct size of the protein (45.9 kDa). HeLa cells were treated with 50 μg/ml MTS-hOGG1-Tat or the desalting buffer for 3 h at 37 °C in an incubator. Following a 3-h protein transduction, HeLa cells were collected by trypsinization and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min after each wash. The pelleted cells were resuspended in ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose in 1× TKM (10 mm Tris, 3 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Cells were allowed to sit for 40 min on ice to allow for cell swelling. Cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclear and mitochondrial organelles. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 0.25 m sucrose in 1× TKM. The cell suspension then was mixed with 2 ml of 2.3 m sucrose in 1× TKM, giving a final sucrose concentration of ∼1.62 m sucrose. The cells then were loaded onto a cushion of 1 ml of 2.3 m sucrose in 1× TKM in 5-ml Ultracentrifuge tubes, and 1 ml of 0.25 m sucrose in 1× TKM was placed on the very top of the column. Samples were centrifuged at 124,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C using a swinging bucket rotor. The tubes were removed, and the mitochondrial fraction (at the 0.25 and 1.62 m sucrose interface) and the nuclear fraction (at the 1.62 and 2.3 m sucrose interface) were collected into separate tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Mitochondrial and nuclear pellets were lysed in lysing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm KCl) with 5 μl/ml protease inhibitors (Sigma) added to each sample. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet the unlysed organelles and membranes. The supernatant from the spin was collected and saved as protein material to be analyzed. A 5′-end radiolabeled 8-oxoguanine oligonucleotide was created by adding the following components together: 14.5 μl of H2O, 2.0 μl of 10× T4 kinase buffer (Promega), 0.5 μl (5 pmol total) of 8-oxoguanine oligonucleotide (Bio-Synthesis), 1.0 μl of T4 kinase (Promega), and 1.5 μl of [33γ]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The 8-oxoguanine oligonucleotide has an 8-oxoguanine lesion at the 11th position. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then heated to 90 °C for 2 min to inactivate the T4 kinase. At that point, 0.5 μl (5 pmol total) of the complementary oligonucleotide (Bio-Synthesis) was added, and the samples were cooled to 4 °C until used. The protein samples from subcellular fractionations were quantitated using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Activity samples were mixed together using the following components: 20 μg of protein and 0.2 pmol of 8-oxoguanine oligonucleotide in 1× REC buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h and then stored at 4 °C until gel analysis. For controls, formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (6.4 units; New England Biolabs) and purified MTS-hOGG1-Tat (5 μg) were utilized. For gel analysis, 4 μl of the activity samples was mixed with 2 μl of 3× alkaline dye (300 mm NaOH, 97% formamide, 0.2% bromphenol blue) and heated to 95 °C for 2 min, and 4 μl was loaded on a 7 m urea, 20% acrylamide gel and run at 200 V in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The gel then was placed on film and put at −70 °C for exposure. Cells were exposed to menadione as described, and following exposure, the cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and pelleted again by centrifugation. Cells then were lysed for 80 s using ice-cold digitonin (0.4 mg/ml digitonin, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm mannitol, 17 mm MOPS, pH 7.4). Lysates were added to 2.5× mannitol-sucrose buffer (525 mm mannitol, 175 mm sucrose, 12.5 mm Tris, 112.5 mm EDTA) to a final concentration of 1×. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min to pellet organelles. The supernatant was collected and used for protein analysis of cytosolic proteins relating to the cell cycle block. These samples were stored at −70 °C until analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed as described previously (4.Dobson A.W. Xu Y. Kelley M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37518-37523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein samples were quantitated using the Bradford assay, aliquoted, and brought to volume with 1× TE and 5× SDS loading dye (0.225 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 5% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.25 m dithiothreitol). Samples were boiled for 5 min, cooled, and resolved by 12 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by standard procedures, and membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in 1× TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) for 1 h. Membranes then were exposed to primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were rinsed with 5% blocking solution, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in 5% blocking solution, and then rinsed with 1× TBS-T. Membranes then were exposed to chemiluminescent substrates (West Dura or West Pico-Pierce) for 5 min and placed on film. The following antibodies were used: HA (Sigma), succinate dehydrogenase (Invitrogen), lamin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), actin (Sigma), phosphorylated Thr-68 and total Chk2 (R&D Systems), and secondary antibodies of anti-mouse, anti-goat, and anti-rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To determine the signaling pathways activated following menadione and CCCP exposure, the human phospho-kinase array kit was utilized (R&D Systems). HeLa cells were plated as described previously and exposed to either menadione (200 μm) or CCCP (50 μm) for 1 h. Following exposure, the cells were lysed according to the supplied protocol and reagents. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay, and 150 μg of protein was placed on each membrane. The membranes were prepared and exposed to film following the supplied protocol, and the densities of the resulting spots on the array were determined using Image Gauge software (Fujifilm). Cells were plated and exposed to menadione as described above. The cells were trypsinized at the appropriate time point and then pelleted by centrifugation. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 70% ice-cold ethanol at a concentration of 1–3 million cells/ml and stored at 4 °C until the day of analysis. Analysis was performed within less than 3 weeks. On the day of analysis, the cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, washed twice in 1× PBS, and pelleted after each wash by centrifugation. After the second 1× PBS wash, the cells were resuspended in serum-free medium (i.e. medium without fetal bovine serum added) at a concentration of ∼1 million cells/ml. At this point, 5 μg of RNase (10 μl of 500 μg/ml RNase) was added to the cell suspension, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Following the incubation, propidium iodide was added to each cell suspension to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and the cells were stored on ice in the dark until analysis by flow cytometry. Approximately 10,000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the resulting distribution of cells was analyzed by the ModFit program to determine the percentage of cells in G0-G1, S, or G2-M phases of the cell cycle. All experiments were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance and the Tukey post hoc test. However, when only two data points were compared, a two-tail Student's t test was used. Data and statistics were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 4 software. Graphical results represent mean ± S.E. Results were deemed statistically significant at the level of p < 0.05 (as labeled with an asterisk in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 and FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8), and experiments were done with n ≥ 3. To determine the effects of menadione on mtDNA damage, HeLa cells were treated with menadione, lysed, and analyzed using the quantitative alkaline Southern blot technique. Menadione caused mtDNA damage in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Also, mtDNA damage was observed at menadione concentrations that were lower than the concentrations at which cell death had been observed previously (4.Dobson A.W. Xu Y. Kelley M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37518-37523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the same samples were analyzed for nuclear DNA damage using QAGE, there was detectable nuclear DNA damage only at menadione doses greater than 300 μm (Fig. 1B). As a result of this finding, further studies were performed at dosage levels at which no nuclear DNA damage was detected (i.e. 200 μm or less). HeLa cells then were exposed to menadione to determine the effects menadione had on cell proliferation and viability. Menadione-treated HeLa cells were collected and analyzed for cell numbers in the presence of trypan blue dye, with viable cells excluding the trypan blue dye. Menadione exposure produced a decrease in the total number of cells present without a significant increase in the percentage of dead cells, with all doses analyzed having more than 95% viability (Fig. 1C). To verify that the decrease in total cell numbers was a cell cycle arrest, HeLa cells were treated with menadione and analyzed using propidium iodide and flow cytometry (Fig. 1D). The results verified that menadione does cause a cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells by arresting cells in the S phase and in a minor, yet significant way in the G2-M phase. Therefore, menadione produced a cell cycle arrest at doses at which mtDNA damage was observed, and no nuclear DNA damage was detected. To determine whether the correlation between mtDNA damage and cell cycle arrest was dependent upon the cell type or chemical used, experiments were performed in an unrelated cell line. RCSN-3 cells are a dopaminergic neuronal cell line derived from rat substantia nigra (14.Martinez-Alvarado P. Dagnino-Subiabre A. Paris I. Metodiewa D. Welch C.J. Olea-Azar C. Caviedes P. Caviedes R.

https://openalex.org/W2039319602,"SHP-1, a haematopoietic cell-specific tyrosine phosphatase, is also expressed in human prostate. In this study, we report that SHP-1 depletion in PC-3 cells induced by small interfering RNAs causes G1 phase cell-cycle arrest accompanied by changes in some components of the cell-cycle machinery. SHP-1 knockdown increases p27Kip1 (p27) protein stability, its nuclear localization and p27 gene transcription. These effects could be mediated by PI3K-AKT pathway as SHP-1 interacts with PI3K regulating its activity and p110 catalytic subunit phosphorylation. The increase in p27 protein stability could also because of reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK2) activity. SHP-1 knockdown decreases the CDK6 levels, inducing retinoblastoma protein hypophosphorylation, downregulation of cyclin E and thereby a decrease in the CDK2 activity. However, the codepletion of SHP-1 and p27 does not produce re-entry into the cycle, implying that p27 is not required to maintain cell-cycle arrest induced by SHP-1 depletion. The maintenance of the PC-3 cell anti-proliferative response after p27 loss could be because of mislocalization of CDK2 induced by SHP-1 knockdown. This study shows that SHP-1 depletion promotes cell-cycle arrest by modulating the activity of cell-cycle regulators and suggests that SHP-1 may be required for the proper functioning of events governing cell-cycle progression."

https://openalex.org/W2041812843,"Glycerol monolaurate (GML), a 12 carbon fatty acid monoester, inhibits Staphylococcus aureus growth and exotoxin production, but is degraded by S. aureus lipase. Therefore, dodecylglycerol (DDG), a 12 carbon fatty acid monoether, was compared in vitro and in vivo to GML for its effects on S. aureus growth, exotoxin production, and stability.Antimicrobial effects of GML and DDG (0 to 500 microg/ml) on 54 clinical isolates of S. aureus, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types USA200, USA300, and USA400, were determined in vitro. A rabbit Wiffle ball infection model assessed GML and DDG (1 mg/ml instilled into the Wiffle ball every other day) effects on S. aureus (MN8) growth (inoculum 3x10(8) CFU/ml), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) production, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations and mortality over 7 days. DDG (50 and 100 microg/ml) inhibited S. aureus growth in vitro more effectively than GML (p<0.01) and was stable to lipase degradation. Unlike GML, DDG inhibition of TSST-1 was dependent on S. aureus growth. GML-treated (4 of 5; 80%) and DDG-treated rabbits (2 of 5; 40%) survived after 7 days. Control rabbits (5 of 5; 100%) succumbed by day 4. GML suppressed TNF-alpha at the infection site on day 7; however, DDG did not (<10 ng/ml versus 80 ng/ml, respectively).These data suggest that DDG was stable to S. aureus lipase and inhibited S. aureus growth at lower concentrations than GML in vitro. However, in vivo GML was more effective than DDG by reducing mortality, and suppressing TNF-alpha, S. aureus growth and exotoxin production, which may reduce toxic shock syndrome. GML is proposed as a more effective anti-staphylococcal topical anti-infective candidate than DDG, despite its potential degradation by S. aureus lipase."
https://openalex.org/W1977992798,"Although HIV-1 Vpr displays several functions in vitro, limited information exists concerning their relevance during infection. Here, we characterized Vpr variants isolated from a rapid and a long-term non-progressor (LTNP). Interestingly, vpr alleles isolated from longitudinal samples of the LTNP revealed a dominant sequence that subsequently led to diversity similar to that observed in the progressor patient. Most of primary Vpr proteins accumulated at the nuclear envelope and interacted with host-cell partners of Vpr. They displayed cytostatic and proapoptotic activities, although a LTNP allele, harboring the Q65R substitution, failed to bind the DCAF1 subunit of the Cul4a/DDB1 E3 ligase and was inactive. This Q65R substitution correlated with impairment of Vpr docking at the nuclear envelope, raising the possibility of a functional link between this property and the Vpr cytostatic activity. In contradiction with published results, the R77Q substitution, found in LTNP alleles, did not influence Vpr proapoptotic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2170868183,"Background Both host genetic potentials for growth and disease resistance, as well as nutrition are known to affect responses of individuals challenged with micro-parasites, but their interactive effects are difficult to predict from experimental studies alone. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, a mathematical model is proposed to explore the hypothesis that a host's response to pathogen challenge largely depends on the interaction between a host's genetic capacities for growth or disease resistance and the nutritional environment. As might be expected, the model predicts that if nutritional availability is high, hosts with higher growth capacities will also grow faster under micro-parasitic challenge, and more resistant animals will exhibit a more effective immune response. Growth capacity has little effect on immune response and resistance capacity has little effect on achieved growth. However, the influence of host genetics on phenotypic performance changes drastically if nutrient availability is scarce. In this case achieved growth and immune response depend simultaneously on both capacities for growth and disease resistance. A higher growth capacity (achieved e.g. through genetic selection) would be detrimental for the animal's ability to cope with pathogens and greater resistance may reduce growth in the short-term. Significance Our model can thus explain contradicting outcomes of genetic selection observed in experimental studies and provides the necessary biological background for understanding the influence of selection and/or changes in the nutritional environment on phenotypic growth and immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2037728701,"The phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate transferase system (PTS) transports glucose in Escherichia coli. Previous work demonstrated that strains lacking PTS, such as PB11, grow slow on glucose. PB11 has a reduced expression of glycolytic, and upregulates poxB and acs genes as compared to the parental strain JM101, when growing on glucose. The products of the latter genes are involved in the production of AcetylCoA. Inactivation of rpoS that codes for the RNA polymerase σ38 subunit, reduces further (50%) growth of PB11, indicating that σ38 plays a central role in the expression of central metabolism genes in slowly growing cells. In fact, transcription levels of glycolytic genes is reduced in strain PB11rpoS− as compared to PB11. In this report we studied the role of σ70 and σ38 in the expression of the complete glycolytic pathway and poxB and acs genes in certain PTS− strains and their rpoS− derivatives. We determined the transcription start sites (TSSs) and the corresponding promoters, in strains JM101, PB11, its derivative PB12 that recovered its growth capacity, and in their rpoS− derivatives, by 5′RACE and pyrosequencing. In all these genes the presence of sequences resembling σ38 recognition sites allowed the proposition that they could be transcribed by both sigma factors, from overlapping putative promoters that initiate transcription at the same site. Fourteen new TSSs were identified in seventeen genes. Besides, more than 30 putative promoters were proposed and we confirmed ten previously reported. In vitro transcription experiments support the functionality of putative dual promoters. Alternatives that could also explain lower transcription levels of the rpoS− derivatives are discussed. We propose that the presence if real, of both σ70 and σ38 dependent promoters in all glycolytic genes and operons could allow a differential transcription of these central metabolism genes by both sigma subunits as an adaptation response to carbon limitation."
https://openalex.org/W2061432892,"Emerging evidence indicates that suppression of protein kinase C (PKC) renders the susceptibility of cells expressing mutated ras to apoptosis. Although the effort has been made, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, using small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or PKC inhibitor, we show that the concurrent suppression of PKC-α and β induces cells ectopically expressing v-ras to undergo apoptosis. In this apoptotic process, PKC-δ is upregulated and translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus. The activated PKC-δ associates with and phosphorylates p73 to initiate apoptosis. In this apoptotic process, Akt seems to be downstream of oncogenic Ras. Moreover, overexpression of PKC-δ, without co-suppression of PKC-α and β, is not apoptotic to the cells, suggesting that PKC-δ and PKC-α/β function oppositely to facilitate cells harboring v-ras to survive. Thus, our study shows that PKC-α and β are necessary for sustaining the homeostasis in cells containing a hyperactive Ras. The abrogation of these two isoforms switches on the p73-regulated apoptotic machinery through the activation of PKC-δ."
https://openalex.org/W1972581130,"B-cell lymphomas are common malignancies in which transformed B cells enter the circulation, extravasate into tissues and form tumors in multiple organs. Lymphoma cells are thought to exit the vasculature and enter tissues through the same chemokine- and adhesion molecule-dependent mechanisms as normal B cells. We have previously shown that activation of the Rap GTPases, proteins that control cytoskeletal organization and integrin activation, is critical for chemokine-induced migration and adhesion in B-lymphoma cell lines. Using the A20 murine B-lymphoma cell line as a model, we now show that Rap activation is important for circulating lymphoma cells to enter tissues and form tumors in vivo. In vitro assays showed that Rap activation is required for A20 cells to efficiently adhere to vascular endothelial cells and undergo transendothelial migration. These findings suggest that Rap or its effectors could be novel targets for treating B-cell lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2057657209,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant worldwide health concern that is associated with discrete etiological events, encompassing viral infection, metabolic stress and genotoxic compounds. In particular, exposure to the genotoxic hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a significant factor in the genesis of human liver cancer. Presumably, genetic events associated with HCC could influence the effect of environmental insults, yielding a predilection for tumor development. The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway is functionally inactivated in HCC through discrete mechanisms; however, the role of RB in suppressing tumorigenesis in this disease is poorly understood. Therefore, we analysed how RB status affects the response to AFB1 in reference to acute exposures and tumor development reflective of chronic exposure. Liver-specific Rb deletion resulted in an aberrant proliferative response to AFB1. This cell-cycle induction was associated with increased levels of secondary genetic damage and failure in appropriate cell-cycle coupling. This effect of RB loss was unique to AFB1 and involved the induction of a non-canonical proliferative pathway, and was not merely reflective of the overall cell-cycle deregulation or aberrant regenerative responses. The acute responses to AFB1 exposure presaged aberrations in hepatocyte nuclear morphology and ploidy with RB loss. Correspondingly, RB-deficient livers showed significantly enhanced susceptibility to liver tumorigenesis initiated by AFB1. Combined, these studies show that RB has a critical role in mediating checkpoint responses in liver tissue to maintain genome integrity and in suppressing tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2039027980,"As I have written previously about my personal history and research journey since graduating from medical school (1.Taniguchi N. IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 703-705Crossref Google Scholar), in this article, I wish to focus on the biochemistry of glutathione and glycosyltransferases, which, on the surface, would appear to be quite different subjects. After obtaining an M.D. and finishing an internship at the university hospital in 1965, my early training in research was obtained in the Department of Biochemistry, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, where I received a Ph.D. degree in 1972. At that time, the department was chaired by Professor Hidematsu Hirai, and the focus of the departmental research effort was primarily on the biological and clinical significance of α-fetoprotein, an oncofetal protein that is synthesized by embryonic tissues and primary hepatomas but not by normal tissues (2.Hirai H. Nishi S. Watabe H. Tsukada Y. Gann Monogr. 1973; 14: 19-34Google Scholar). I had already developed an interest in enzymology, and I also became interested in an area that was very different from the mainstream program in the department. I decided to focus on the enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism during experimental hepatocarcinogenesis of rats that had been fed 0.06% 3′-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene under the guidance of Dr. Yutaka Tsukada. In these studies, rats were killed at weekly intervals, and the glutathione levels and glutathione-related enzymes were assayed spectrophotometrically. The experiments started early in the morning and usually ended at around midnight. I found that the activity of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, one of the glutathione-degrading enzymes, in rats the fed azo dye underwent two biphasic changes, i.e. the activity was increased at an early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis, then decreased, and finally increased again at the late stage. Similar changes in the pattern for α-fetoprotein had been reported by a group in the same department. The actual level of glutathione decreased at the early stage, then increased, and again decreased at the late stage, mirroring the pattern observed for γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (3.Taniguchi N. Tsukada Y. Mukuo K. Hirai H. Gann. 1974; 65: 381-387PubMed Google Scholar). I hypothesized that γ-glutamyl transpeptidase might also be an oncofetal protein, analogous to α-fetoprotein. In fact, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity is high in fetal tissues, but the enzyme is also ubiquitously distributed and abundant in the kidney. After receiving my Ph.D., I spent one year as a research fellow in the same laboratory and then moved to the Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine. In 1974, Alton Meister, Professor and Chair of the Department of Biochemistry at the Cornell Medical School, presented a plenary lecture on the γ-glutamyl cycle at the annual meeting of the Japan Biochemical Society held in Okayama, Japan. He was agreeable to my working with him in New York, and I joined his group as a visiting associate professor on September 1, 1976. At that time, there were many postdoctoral fellows and faculty members in Meister's laboratory, and they published numerous excellent papers on glutathione metabolism, including the chemical synthesis of buthionine sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase; the chemical synthesis of glutathione esters that are able to enter the cell; the feedback inhibition of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase; and the characterization of metabolic disorders of glutathione via the γ-glutamyl cycle, first thought to play a role in amino acid transport but later shown to be largely involved in the turnover of glutathione (Fig. 1) (4.Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5897) Google Scholar, 5.Meister A. Molecular Perspectives and Clinical Implications.in: Taniguchi N. Higashi T. Sakamoto Y. Meister A. Academic Press, New York1986: 3-21Google Scholar). He was a heavy smoker, so I could soon recognize him by the smell of his cigars and pipes when he showed up in the lab and when I visited him to discuss research progress in his office on the first floor. Glutathione is synthesized via two enzymes, glutathione synthetase and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, both of which require ATP. Likewise, the degradation of glutathione is catalyzed by two enzymes, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and γ-glutamylcyclotransferase. I was involved in the purification of γ-glutamylcyclotransferase from rat kidney, which was highly heterogeneous because of sulfhydryl modifications of the enzyme. I was supposed to become an associate professor in a newly launched department, i.e. the Graduate School of Environmental Science at Hokkaido University. I was obliged to return to Japan, but the research situation was not well organized, and I became interested in moving to another laboratory. Half a year later, Professor Akira Makita kindly offered me a position of associate professor in the Cancer Institute of the same university. His group discovered various cancer-associated changes in various enzymes such as arylsulfatases (6.Gasa S. Balbaa M. Nakamura M. Yonemori H. Makita A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1230-1238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β-glucuronidase, hexokinases, cathepsin D, and galactosyltransferase-1 and glycolipids such as sulfatides. Some of the work on sulfatides was subsequently carried out by Koichi Honke, who purified sulfatide synthase, cloned the cDNA and gene, produced null mice, and discovered many interesting phenotypes (7.Honke K. Hirahara Y. Dupree J. Suzuki K. Popko B. Fukushima K. Fukushima J. Nagasawa T. Yoshida N. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). He later joined our group as an associate professor and was a valuable member of our department. When I first joined the Makita laboratory, I was not familiar with glycoprotein or glycolipid research, and I was just like a saint's maid quoting Latin. Finally, however, I learned many techniques that subsequently proved to be useful in the area of glycobiology and published several articles under his guidance. I enjoyed my tenure as an associate professor in his group very much, as well as my interactions with the various graduate students in the group. I also published several papers on non-enzymatic glycosylation (glycation), the Maillard reaction, in relation to free radical research or diabetes, which subsequently became the other project of my research journey when I moved to Osaka University (8.Taniguchi N. Adv. Clin. Chem. 1992; 29: 1-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). While there, I was able to restart experiments on γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. At that time, several glycolytic enzymes such as aldolase C, hexokinase, and pyruvate kinase had been reported to be activated in cancer and fetal and muscle tissues, and isozymic forms such as the muscle type were present in hepatoma tissues. Even though my preliminary experiments on γ-glutamyl transpeptidase suggested that isozymic forms were not present, I nevertheless continued to wonder if a specific isozymic form of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase was also activated in hepatomas. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase is a glycoprotein and was first purified from bovine kidney by Meister's group. Therefore, I was interested in purifying the enzymes again from various rat tissues such as fetal, kidney, normal liver, and tumor tissues with the objective of comparing their biochemical properties as judged by kinetic properties, isoelectric focusing patterns, antigenicity, and amino acid analysis. The only difference we found was in the sugar composition, i.e. the levels of neutral sugars and sialic acid, as the isoelectric focusing patterns varied before and after treatment with sialidase (9.Yokosawa N. Taniguchi N. Tsukada Y. Makita A. Oncodev. Biol. Med. 1981; 2: 165-177PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Taniguchi N. Yokosawa N. Iizuka S. Tukada Y. Sako F. Miyazawa N. Gann Monogr. 1983; 29: 263-272Google Scholar). Since then, I decided to focus on the sugar chains of the enzyme. In collaboration with Professor Akira Kobata (Kobe University), an eminent glycobiology expert, we found that the enzyme purified from ascites hepatoma AH-66 cells contained bisecting GlcNAc, whereas the enzyme purified from normal liver did not (11.Yamashita K. Hitoi A. Taniguchi N. Yokosawa N. Tsukada Y. Kobata A. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 5059-5063PubMed Google Scholar). In February 6, 1986, I received an unexpected phone call from the dean of the Osaka University Medical School, who told me that I was a candidate for the position of Professor and Chair of the Department of Biochemistry, one of the oldest and most prestigious biochemistry departments in Japan. The First Chair of the department was Professor Yashiro Kotake, who elucidated the chemistry of kynurenine and was an eminent biochemist and an expert in tryptophan metabolism. The Third Chair was Professor Osamu Hayaishi, a world-renowned and eminent biochemist famous for his pioneering work on oxygenase and prostaglandins. I was very happy and honored to accept this position and subsequently moved to Osaka on April 1, 1986. I decided to change my project from protein chemistry to glycobiology in this new department. As 1988 was the 100th anniversary of the discovery of glutathione, I co-organized a meeting on the “Glutathione Centennial: Molecular Perspectives and Clinical Implications” with Dr. Yukiya Sakamoto and his group. Alton Meister also attended the conference as an organizer. At the meeting, he comprehensively reviewed the history of glutathione and its metabolism, designated as the γ-glutamyl cycle (12.Meister A. Glutathione Centennial.in: Taniguchi N. Higashi T. Sakamoto Y. Meister A. Academic Press, New York1998: 3-22Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1. His group had been involved in studies in this area for the last 10 years or so. We reported on the purification and cDNA cloning of human γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and also reported on the significance of highly activated UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:β-d-mannoside β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), which may modify γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in hepatoma tissues and hyperplastic nodules. In 1988, we also reported on a marked activation of GnT-III activity in primary hepatoma and ascites hepatoma, which could explain the unique changes in the sugar units attached to γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, i.e. the addition of a bisecting GlcNAc, a product of GnT-III. In 1992, we organized the Sapporo Cancer Seminar, which was founded by Dr. Hiroshi Kobayashi, Professor Emeritus of Hokkaido University; this seminar is a Gordon Conference-like meeting that focuses on cancer research. I invited Alton Meister, Owen Griffith, Susumu Nishimura, Cecil Pickets, Harold Deutsch, and other distinguished speakers who were actively involved in glutathione research, redox regulation, and nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species (Fig. 2). Immediately after the meeting, we celebrated Alton's 70th birthday in Osaka, and many Japanese scientists, good friends of his or former colleagues, attended. Since Yoshitaka Ikeda in our group joined Alton's laboratory in 1993, we continued the work on the catalytic properties of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in a collaborative effort, which focused mainly on studies of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis. Two years later, in 1995, Alton suffered a stroke during a trip to New Zealand, and after returning to New York, he passed away in December at the age of 72. The final paper that Alton actually handled was ours, which appeared in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in September 1995 (13.Ikeda Y. Fujii J. Anderson M.E. Taniguchi N. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22223-22228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); this article was the culmination of his work. Alton's death was a great loss not only for glutathione metabolism but also for biochemistry in the world. His enormous contributions to our understanding of glutathione metabolism through the concept of the γ-glutamyl cycle (Fig. 1) and amino acid metabolism will remain forever as his legacy. Our data on the catalytic mechanism of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, including the work with Alton, were published (14.Taniguchi N. Ikeda Y. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 239-278PubMed Google Scholar). Starting in 1986, we began to purify the glycosyltransferase, which catalyzes the biosynthesis of the bisecting GlcNAc found in γ-glutamyl transpeptidase purified from ascites hepatoma AH-66 cells. At that time, the method used in assaying glycosyltransferases involved the incorporation of 14C- or 3H-labeled nucleotide sugars into the acceptor substrate, but this was a time-consuming and rather expensive method. Therefore, we attempted to develop a simpler, less costly method of analysis. The groups of Drs. Hase and Ikenaka at Osaka University developed a method involving the pyridylamination of the nonreducing end of glycans to analyze sugar chains. Atsushi Nishikawa and co-workers (15.Taniguchi N. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gu J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) successfully employed this technique to assay the activity of various glycosyltransferases such as GnT-III, -IV, -V, and -VI. Using this assay method, we measured the GnT-III activity of various hepatoma cells and azo dye-induced hepatomas and found that the enzyme activity was substantially elevated in most hepatomas. In some cases, the activity was 100-fold greater than that in a normal rat liver. To obtain a cDNA clone, we attempted to purify GnT-III by affinity chromatography using biantennary sugar chains, the substrate for GnT-III. We first prepared a large amount of bisected biantennary sugar chains from human serum transferrin. Because GnT-III activity is very high in rat kidney, we collected a large number of kidneys from rats that had been killed during physiological experiments in other laboratories. We ultimately collected 10 kg of rat kidneys. The enzyme was purified >153,000-fold in 1.5% yield from a Triton X-100 extract of rat kidneys by fractionation procedures utilizing QAE-Sepharose, Cu2+-chelating Sepharose, and affinity chromatography on UDP-hexanolamine and substrate-conjugated Sepharose, and finally, the cDNA encoding GnT-III was successfully cloned (16.Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is responsible for the formation of a bisecting glycan, as first published by Dr. Harry Schachter, who reported the presence of numerous N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases such as GnT-I, -II, -III, -IV, -V, and -VI. His group purified GnT-I and GnT-II for the first time and then cloned their genes (17.Schachter H. Narasimhan S. Gleeson P. Vella G. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1983; 61: 1049-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). His contribution in this field has been enormous, and I met Harry for the first time in 1989, when Dr. Makita organized the Second Sapporo Cancer Seminar at a time when I was a new comer in this field. Since then, every time I met Harry, he gave me valuable suggestions and encouragement in our work on glycosyltransferases even though his lab has been our major competitor in this area because very few groups have attempted to purify and biochemically characterize the enzyme and then clone the gene (Fig. 3). We further purified various glycosyltransferases involved in N-glycan branch biosynthesis one by one and cloned their genes; these included GnT-V (18.Gu J. Nishikawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and GnT-IV, GnT-VI, synthetic enzyme for poly-N-acetyllactosamine, and α1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) (19.Uozumi N. Yanagidani S. Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Sakuma T. Gao C.X. Teshima T. Fujii S. Shiba T. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 121: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our group also cloned other glycosyltransferases using molecular cloning techniques as depicted in Fig. 4. In 1989, I organized the first glycosyltransferase meeting in Osaka, and numerous eminent scientists in this field, including Robert Hill, Pamela Stanley, Jamey Marth, Gerald Hart, Ajit Varki, Jurgen Roth, Minoru Fukuda, Laurence Tabak, Andre Verbert, John Lowe, and many renowned Japanese glycobiologists, attended, and the significance of glycosyltransferases was discussed. Last year, the sixth meeting (now called Glyco T) was organized by Richard Cummings and Michael Pierce and held in Atlanta. Using the cloned glycosyltransferase genes, we next initiated studies related to functional glycomics using sugar-remodeling techniques by gene transfections, knock-out and/or transgenic mice, and small interfering RNA. We were able to show various functional changes in glycans as the result of aberrant glycosylation (21.Taniguchi N. Yoshimura M. Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22.Taniguchi N. Ihara S. Saito T. Miyoshi E. Ikeda Y. Honke K. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23.Taniguchi N. Gu J. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2004; 80: 82-91Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24.Taniguchi N. Miyoshi E. Gu J. Jianguo G. Honke K. Matsumoto A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using the cloned glycosyltransferases. Moreover, to utilize a functional glycomics approach, we emphasized the importance of identifying the target protein(s) of the glycosyltransferase genes. At that time, some researchers asked, “What would happen if you were able to identify one or two target proteins among the numerous glycosylated proteins that could undergo glycosylation? This is analogous to pointing out one star among the universe.” However, we now all realize that, even though the knock-out of a certain glycosyltransferase gene may lead to various phenotypic changes due to a lack of glycan in various glycoproteins, in fact, phenotypic changes accompanied by functional changes in glycans are very limited. This indicates that the identification of target protein(s) is very important in characterizing glycan functions. In 2002, I co-edited and published a handbook in which most of the biochemical and molecular properties of glycosyltransferases and related genes are described (25.Taniguchi N. Honke K. Fukuda M. Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Related Genes. Springer, Tokyo2002Crossref Google Scholar). Our major glycosyltransferases of interest are depicted in Fig. 4. As we observed previously, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase was one of the target proteins for GnT-III. To explore the other functions of the GnT-III gene and its target proteins, our group conducted experiments using cells that had been transfected by the GnT-III gene and found different types of likely target proteins as follows (21.Taniguchi N. Yoshimura M. Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22.Taniguchi N. Ihara S. Saito T. Miyoshi E. Ikeda Y. Honke K. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23.Taniguchi N. Gu J. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2004; 80: 82-91Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24.Taniguchi N. Miyoshi E. Gu J. Jianguo G. Honke K. Matsumoto A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). K562 cells are usually killed by the immune systems in the spleen, but GnT-III-transfected K562 cells are not. This is due to a decreased sensitivity to natural killer cell cytotoxicity, which leads to increased spleen colonization by these cells in athymic mice. We identified target proteins that recognize bisecting GlcNAc, a product of GnT-III, as annexin V and apoprotein B. Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) also contain N-glycans, and several researchers have proposed that they play a role in growth factor signaling. The deletion of Asn241 from the EGFR permits the molecule to dimerize spontaneously without phosphorylation (26.Tsuda T. Ikeda Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21988-21994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Erb-2 glycans play a key role in growth factor signaling because, without glycans, Erb-2 dimerizes without phosphorylation and enhances tumor development in vitro (27.Takahashi M. Yokoe S. Asahi M. Lee S.H. Li W. Osumi D. Miyoshi E. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In GnT-III-transfected glioma cells, EGF binding was blocked, and autophosphorylation of the EGFR occurred. In HeLa cells, GnT-III transfection inhibited the low affinity binding of EGF to the EGFR but enhanced the high affinity binding and the internalization rate of the EGFR. The transfection of GnT-III further resulted in 1) the inhibition of the growth factor response of tyrosine phosphorylation of the Trk/nerve growth factor receptor following the addition of nerve growth factor, 2) the inhibition of neurite growth induced by co-stimulation of EGF and integrins, and 3) the inhibition of EGFR-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. The target proteins of GnT-III responsible for these effects were identified as the EGFR and integrin α3β1. CD44 obtained from GnT-III-transfected mouse melanoma cells exhibited increased adhesion to hyaluronate, which enhanced CD44-mediated tumor growth and metastasis in the spleen after subcutaneous inoculation into mice. The α1–3Gal epitope is a xenotransplantation antigen absent in humans. Thus, in the case of xenotransplantation from pigs to apes or humans, subacute rejection will occur because of the presence of an antibody against the αGal epitope in humans and apes. Interestingly, the transfection of GnT-III into pig cells or the generation of GnT-III transgenic pigs markedly reduced the αGal epitope by inhibiting α1–3Gal-transferase action, thus reducing its antigenicity. GnT-III serves as a STOP signal for other glycosyltransferases such as GnT-II, -IV, and -V, and once a bisecting GlcNAc is incorporated, those enzymes no longer act. Therefore, a high expression of GnT-III would be expected to inhibit the synthesis of multiantennary complex carbohydrates and to evoke various phenotypic alterations reflecting abolished glycan functions. Gu et al. (18.Gu J. Nishikawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) confirmed this substrate specificity using purified GnT-V and demonstrated that GnT-V does not act on a bisected biantennary chain. This catalytic function was originally reported by Schachter et al. (17.Schachter H. Narasimhan S. Gleeson P. Vella G. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1983; 61: 1049-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) using a crude enzyme preparation. B16-hm cells, in which GnT-V is highly expressed, therefore leading to increased β1,6 branching, have a high metastatic potential. In contrast, lung metastasis in syngeneic and athymic mice after an intravenous injection of B16-hm cells transfected with the gene encoding GnT-III was dramatically suppressed (28.Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). GnT-V catalyzes the addition of a β1–6 linkage to the Manα1–6 residue of GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6Man between the arm of the N-glycan core. In the GnT-III transfectants, the level of β1,6 branches is decreased due to competition for the substrate by intrinsic GnT-V and ectopically expressed GnT-III (Fig. 5). The underlying mechanism by which lung metastasis is suppressed is due to elevated E-cadherin levels on cell-cell borders. Upon overexpression of GnT-III in melanoma cells, E-cadherin remains on the cell-cell border and enhances the attachment of cancer cells to protect cancer metastasis. As E-cadherin·β-catenin complexes are quite stable, the increased E-cadherin levels result in the complete down-regulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin after EGF treatment (23.Taniguchi N. Gu J. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2004; 80: 82-91Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24.Taniguchi N. Miyoshi E. Gu J. Jianguo G. Honke K. Matsumoto A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Conversely, the disruption of E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion appears to be a central event in the transition from noninvasive to invasive carcinomas. Interestingly, we recently found that E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interaction up-regulated GnT-III expression, suggesting that the regulation of GnT-III and E-cadherin expression may represent a positive feedback loop and may be implicated in endothelial-mesenchymal transition (29.Akama R. Sato Y. Kariya Y. Isaji T. Fukuda T. Lu L. Taniguchi N. Ozawa M. Gu J. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 3221-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). E-cadherin contains four N-glycan sites, and the role of glycans in terms of cell adhesion is now well recognized. The increased GnT-V levels were attributed to the up-regulation of the Ets family of transcriptional activators, which increase GnT-V expression. Knock-out mice of Mgat5, encoding GnT-V, develop into apparently normal adults, but the incidences of polyoma virus middle T oncogene-induced mammary tumor growth and metastases are considerably lower in knock-out mice than in transgenic littermates. N-Glycans bearing the GnT-V branch amplify oncogene signaling of tumor growth in vivo (30.Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Integrins, crucial molecules for cell adhesion, have been shown to be the major N-glycan-containing molecules on cell membranes. For example, integrin α5β1 contains 14 and 12 putative N-glycosylation sites on the α5 and β1 subunits, respectively. Introduction of a bisecting GlcNAc to N-glycans of integrin α5 by the overexpression of GnT-III diminished ligand binding, cell adhesion, and cell migration. Contrary to the functions of GnT-III, the overexpression of GnT-V promoted integrin α5β1-mediated cell migration (31.Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the opposing effects of GnT-III and GnT-V have been observed for the same target protein, integrin α3β1. N-Glycosylation of the β-propeller domain on the α5 subunit (32.Zhao Y. Nakagawa T. Itoh S. Inamori K. Isaji T. Kariya Y. Kondo A. Miyoshi E. Miyazaki K. Kawasaki N. Taniguchi N. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32122-32130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and the I-like domain on the β1 subunit is essential to both the heterodimerization and biological functions of the subunits. In addition, among many N-glycosylation sites of the α5 subunit, only N-glycosylation site-4 on the β-propeller was specifically modified by GnT-III, thereby regulating integrin α5β1-mediated cell spreading and cell migration. Our group identified matriptase as a target protein for GnT-V and showed that the overexpression of GnT-V results in the increased expression of matriptase due to the resistance of matriptase to autodegradation. Matriptase is known to be associated with cancer invasion and metastasis, and its expression is enhanced in some types of tumor cells. Moreover, GnT-V may function as an inducer of angiogenesis, thereby promoting metastasis (22.Taniguchi N. Ihara S. Saito T. Miyoshi E. Ikeda Y. Honke K. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23.Taniguchi N. Gu J. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol.

Biol. 2006; 16: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). TIMP-1 was identified as a target protein for GnT-V. The poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains on GnT-V-dependent N-glycan antennae serve as ligands for galectin-3, and it has been suggested that GnT-V strengthens the galectin-3/glycoprotein lattice on the T-cell receptor, thereby restricting the recruitment of T-cell receptors to the site of antigen presentation and impeding antigen-dependent receptor clustering and signal transduction (33.Lagana A. Goetz J.G. Cheung P. Raz A. Dennis J.W. Nabi I.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3181-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). l-Fuc:N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide α1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) catalyzes the transfer of a fucose residue from GDP-Fuc to position 6 of the innermost GlcNAc residue (core fucose residue) of an N-linked sugar hybrid and complex types of N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins. The enzyme was first purified to homogeneity and cloned by our group from porcine brain as well as from human gastric cancer cells (19.Uozumi N. Yanagidani S. Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Sakuma T. Gao C.X.

https://openalex.org/W2065538031,"Acquisition of independence from anchorage to the extracellular matrix is a critical event for onset and progression of solid cancers. To identify and characterize new genes conferring anchorage independence, we transduced MCF10A human normal breast cells with a retroviral cDNA expression library and selected them by growth in suspension. Microarray analysis targeted on library-derived transcripts revealed robust and reproducible enrichment, after selection, of cDNAs encoding the scaffolding adaptor Gab2. Gab2 was confirmed to strongly promote anchorage-independent growth when overexpressed. Interestingly, downregulation by RNA interference of endogenous Gab2 in neoplastic cells did not affect their adherent growth, but abrogated their growth in soft agar. Gab2-driven anchorage independence was found to specifically involve activation of the Src-Stat3 signaling axis. A transcriptional 'signature' of 205 genes was obtained from GAB2-transduced, anchorage-independent MCF10A cells, and found to contain two main functional modules, controlling proliferation and cell adhesion/migration/invasion, respectively. Extensive validation on breast cancer data sets showed that the GAB2 signature provides a robust prognostic classifier for breast cancer metastatic relapse, largely independent from existing clinical and genomic indicators and from estrogen receptor status. This work highlights a pivotal role for GAB2 and its transcriptional targets in anchorage-independent growth and breast cancer metastatic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2057397488,"Background Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a central regulator of cell growth and may control cancer development. A cis noncoding rRNA (nc-rRNA) upstream from the 45S rRNA transcription start site has recently been implicated in control of rRNA transcription in mouse fibroblasts. We investigated whether a similar nc-rRNA might be expressed in human cancer epithelial cells, and related to any genomic characteristics. Methodology/Principal Findings Using quantitative rRNA measurement, we demonstrated that a nc-rRNA is transcribed in human lung epithelial and lung cancer cells, starting from approximately −1000 nucleotides upstream of the rRNA transcription start site (+1) and extending at least to +203. This nc-rRNA was significantly more abundant in the majority of lung cancer cell lines, relative to a nontransformed lung epithelial cell line. Its abundance correlated negatively with total 45S rRNA in 12 of 13 cell lines (P = 0.014). During sequence analysis from −388 to +306, we observed diverse, frequent intercopy single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in rRNA, with a frequency greater than predicted by chance at 12 sites. A SNP at +139 (U/C) in the 5′ leader sequence varied among the cell lines and correlated negatively with level of the nc-rRNA (P = 0.014). Modelling of the secondary structure of the rRNA 5′-leader sequence indicated a small increase in structural stability due to the +139 U/C SNP and a minor shift in local configuration occurrences. Conclusions/Significance The results demonstrate occurrence of a sense nc-rRNA in human lung epithelial and cancer cells, and imply a role in regulation of the rRNA gene, which may be affected by a +139 SNP in the 5′ leader sequence of the primary rRNA transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2036872340,"The cystatin protein superfamily is characterized by the presence of conserved sequences that display cysteine protease inhibitory activity (e.g., towards cathepsins). Type 1 and 2 cystatins are encoded by 25 genes of which 23 are grouped in 2 clusters localized on mouse chromosomes 16 and 2. The expression and essential roles of most of these genes in mouse development and hematopoiesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we describe a set of quantitative real-time PCR assays and a global expression profile of cystatin genes in normal mouse tissues. Benefiting from our collection of DelES embryonic stem cell clones harboring large chromosomal deletions (to be reported elsewhere), we selected a clone in which a 95-kb region of chromosome 16 is missing (Del16qB3Δ/+). In this particular clone, 2 cystatin genes, namely Csta and Stfa2l1 are absent along with 2 other genes (Fam162a, Ccdc58) and associated intergenic regions. From this line, we established a new homozygous mutant mouse model (Del16qB3Δ/16qB3Δ) to assess the in vivo biological functions of the 2 deleted cystatins. Stfa2l1 gene expression is high in wild-type fetal liver, bone marrow, and spleen, while Csta is ubiquitously expressed. Homozygous Del16qB3Δ/16qB3Δ animals are phenotypically normal, fertile, and not overtly susceptible to spontaneous or irradiation-induced tumor formation. The hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell activity in these mutant mice are also normal. Interestingly, quantitative real-time PCR expression profiling reveals a marked increase in the expression levels of Stfa2l1/Csta phylogenetically-related genes (Stfa1, Stfa2, and Stfa3) in Del16qB3Δ/16qB3Δ hematopoietic tissues, suggesting that these candidate genes might be contributing to compensatory mechanisms. Overall, this study presents an optimized approach to globally monitor cystatin gene expression as well as a new mouse model deficient in Stfa2l1/Csta genes, expanding the available tools to dissect cystatin roles under normal and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2019105479,"Many bacteria express phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems (PTS). The mannitol-specific PTS catalyze the uptake and phosphorylation of d-mannitol. The uptake system comprises several genes encoded in the single operon. The expression of the mannitol operon is regulated by a proposed transcriptional factor, mannitol operon repressor (MtlR) that was first studied in Escherichia coli. Here we report the first crystal structures of MtlR from Vibrio parahemeolyticus (Vp-MtlR) and its homolog YggD protein from Shigella flexneri (Sf-YggD). MtlR and YggD belong to the same protein family (Pfam05068). Although Vp-MtlR and Sf-YggD share low sequence identity (22%), their overall structures are very similar, representing a novel all α-helical fold, and indicate similar function. However, their lack of any known DNA-binding structural motifs and their unfavorable electrostatic properties imply that MtlR/YggD are unlikely to bind a specific DNA operator directly as proposed earlier. This structural observation is further corroborated by in vitro DNA-binding studies of E. coli MtlR (Ec-MtlR), which detected no interaction of Ec-MtlR with the well characterized mannitol operator/promoter region. Therefore, MtlR/YggD belongs to a new class of transcription factors in bacteria that may regulate gene expression indirectly as a part of a larger transcriptional complex. Many bacteria express phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems (PTS). The mannitol-specific PTS catalyze the uptake and phosphorylation of d-mannitol. The uptake system comprises several genes encoded in the single operon. The expression of the mannitol operon is regulated by a proposed transcriptional factor, mannitol operon repressor (MtlR) that was first studied in Escherichia coli. Here we report the first crystal structures of MtlR from Vibrio parahemeolyticus (Vp-MtlR) and its homolog YggD protein from Shigella flexneri (Sf-YggD). MtlR and YggD belong to the same protein family (Pfam05068). Although Vp-MtlR and Sf-YggD share low sequence identity (22%), their overall structures are very similar, representing a novel all α-helical fold, and indicate similar function. However, their lack of any known DNA-binding structural motifs and their unfavorable electrostatic properties imply that MtlR/YggD are unlikely to bind a specific DNA operator directly as proposed earlier. This structural observation is further corroborated by in vitro DNA-binding studies of E. coli MtlR (Ec-MtlR), which detected no interaction of Ec-MtlR with the well characterized mannitol operator/promoter region. Therefore, MtlR/YggD belongs to a new class of transcription factors in bacteria that may regulate gene expression indirectly as a part of a larger transcriptional complex. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems (PTS) 2The abbreviations used are: PTSphosphotransferase system(s)Se-MetselenomethionineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidr.m.s.root mean square. primarily consist of a transmembrane transporter and enzymes responsible for phosphoryl group transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate to a transporter-bound sugar acceptor (1.Saier Jr., M.H.

It is one of the hexitols involved in bacteria catabolism pathways, where it serves as a source of fermentable sugar (4.Berkowitz D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 232-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Lengeler J. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 39-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The d-mannitol-specific PTS was first discovered and sequenced in Escherichia coli (6.Lee C.A. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol.

Taking into consideration that the system was regulated like other hexitol PTS systems, an open reading frame was sought and identified within the mannitol operon (9.Figge R.M. Ramseier T.M. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 840-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments indicated that the loss of the gene (mtlR) led to the constitutive expression of the operon, and its gene product MtlR was proposed to be a transcription factor: mannitol operon repressor (MtlR, COG2213) (9.Figge R.M. Ramseier T.M. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 840-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two putative DNA operator palindromes that might serve as MltR binding sites were identified within the operator-promoter region. phosphotransferase system(s) selenomethionine 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid root mean square. Besides MtlR, a typical mannitol operon also encodes a mannitol-specific PTS system ABC transporter II component (MtlA, COG2213) and a mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase (MtlD, COG0246). The mannitol operon is conserved and has been cloned from many Gram-negative bacterial families, such as Shigella (10.Wei J. Goldberg M.B. Burland V. Venkatesan M.M. Deng W. Fournier G. Mayhew G.F.

A paralogue gene yggD annotated as putative transcriptional regulator was found clustered with cmtA and cmtB on chromosome II of V. parahemeolyticus. The cmtA and cmtB genes seem to encode the equivalents of MtlA components according to a recent study (16.Yu C. Li Y. Xia B. Jin C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In genomes of many other Gram-negative bacteria, a gene named yggD, encoding a sequence homolog of MtlR, has also been identified. The gene yggD is not clustered with mtlA and mtlD as mtlR in a typical mannitol operon. Its gene neighbors vary considerably among organisms, even among strains, and its position provides little insight into its function. In the complete genome sequence of Shigella flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T (10.Wei J. Goldberg M.B. Burland V. Venkatesan M.M. Deng W. Fournier G. Mayhew G.F. Plunkett 3rd, G. Rose D.J. Darling A.

Immun. 2003; 71: 2775-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), for example, the yggD gene is located about 1 megabase pair away from the mannitol operon on the same strand of DNA (10.Wei J. Goldberg M.B. Burland V. Venkatesan M.M. Deng W. Fournier G. Mayhew G.F. Plunkett 3rd, G. Rose D.J. Darling A. Mau B. Perna N.T. Payne S.M. Runyen-Janecky L.J. Zhou S. Schwartz D.C. Blattner F.R. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2775-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Its neighboring genes include uncharacterized yggC and yggF. The latter may encode a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase II-like protein (10.Wei J. Goldberg M.B. Burland V. Venkatesan M.M. Deng W. Fournier G. Mayhew G.F. Plunkett 3rd, G. Rose D.J. Darling A. Mau B.

The function of YggD has never been described. However, based on its sequence similarity to MtlR, it has been assigned to the same protein family, Pfam05068 (mannitol operon repressor) (17.Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein structural information of mannitol operon components has been limited to the IIA domain of MtlA from E. coli (18.van Montfort R.L. Pijning T. Kalk K.H. Hangyi I. Kouwijzer M.L. Robillard G.T. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1998; 6: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and Salmonella typhimurium LT2 (Protein Data Bank code 1XIZ). The enzyme IIA consists of a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices on both sides, which is remarkably different from IIA proteins that belong to the other three EIIs groups of PTS (18.van Montfort R.L. Pijning T. Kalk K.H. Hangyi I. Kouwijzer M.L. Robillard G.T. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1998; 6: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To understand the structure, molecular mechanism, and regulation of the mannitol operon, we have expressed and purified a number of MtlR and YggD from different bacterial species. Several expression vectors were used to improve protein solubility, and reductive methylation was applied to augment crystallization (19.Kim Y. Quartey P. Li H. Volkart L. Hatzos C. Chang C. Nocek B. Cuff M. Osipiuk J. Tan K. Fan Y. Bigelow L. Maltseva N. Wu R. Borovilos M. Duggan E. Zhou M. Binkowski T.A. Zhang R.G. Joachimiak A. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 853-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we present the crystal structures of MtlR from V. parahemeolyticus (Vp-MtlR) and YggD from S. flexneri (Sf-YggD), the first structures of the mannitol operon repressor family. The structures of Vp-MtlR and Sf-YggD were determined at 2.75 and 2.50 Å resolution, respectively, and represent a novel all α-helical fold. Although Vp-MtlR and Sf-YggD share low sequence identity, they are structurally very similar and also form similar dimers. The analysis of their structural features and surface electrostatic properties in combination with DNA-binding studies of Ec-MtlR suggests that MtlR/YggD are unlikely to bind DNA directly. We also provide direct biochemical evidence that the MtlR does not bind the regulatory region of the E. coli mannitol operon. Therefore, MtlR seems to belong to a new class of transcription factors in bacteria and may regulate gene expression indirectly, perhaps as a part of a larger transcriptional complex. A truncated on C terminus mtlR gene from V. parahemeolyticus RIMD 2210633 was cloned into pMCSG7 vector (20.Stols L. Gu M. Dieckman L. Raffen R. Collart F.R. Donnelly M.I. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The gene codes Vp-MtlR without four C-terminal residues, D173SPF. The protocols for the expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purification of the Se-Met-labeled recombinant protein were reported previously (21.Kim Y. Dementieva I. Zhou M. Wu R. Lezondra L. Quartey P. Joachimiak G. Korolev O. Li H. Joachimiak A. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The Vp-MtlR expressed well with a final protein yield of about 195 mg/liter of culture. The full-length yggD gene from S. flexneri 2a 2457T was initially cloned into pMCSG7 vector. The solubility of Sf-YggD was very low, with a soluble protein yield of ∼5 mg/liter of culture. To improve the protein production, pMCSG19 expression vector was utilized (22.Donnelly M.I. Zhou M. Millard C.S. Clancy S. Stols L. Eschenfeldt W.H. Collart F.R. Joachimiak A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which bears a fusion construct with maltose-binding protein followed by the TVMV protease cleavage site, His6-tag, and TEV protease cleavage site fused into the N terminus of the target protein. The expression and purification protocols of Se-Met-labeled recombinant Sf-YggD were the same as for Vp-MtlR (21.Kim Y. Dementieva I. Zhou M. Wu R. Lezondra L. Quartey P. Joachimiak G. Korolev O. Li H. Joachimiak A. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). With the use of pMCSG19 vector, the Sf-YggD yield increased to 62 mg/liter of culture. The expression constructs for Ec-MtlR, FruR1 (coding for the first 57 amino acids of fructose repressor (FruR)), and FruR2 (the full-length protein) were cloned into the NdeI and XhoI restrictions sites of pET28. The resulting constructs consisting of an N-terminal His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site were expressed in BL21(DE3) and purified as reported earlier (23.Sassoon J. Hörer S. Stoop J. Mooibroek H. Baumann U. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The gene for full-length Ec-MtlR was also cloned into pMCSG7 vector. The protein was expressed and purified as reported previously (21.Kim Y. Dementieva I. Zhou M. Wu R. Lezondra L. Quartey P. Joachimiak G. Korolev O. Li H. Joachimiak A. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A reductive methylation of lysine residues of Sf-YggD was performed to improve protein crystallization properties (19.Kim Y. Quartey P. Li H. Volkart L. Hatzos C. Chang C. Nocek B. Cuff M. Osipiuk J. Tan K. Fan Y. Bigelow L. Maltseva N. Wu R. Borovilos M. Duggan E. Zhou M. Binkowski T.A. Zhang R.G. Joachimiak A. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 853-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). During reductive methylation, the protein is modified through the addition of two methyl groups to Lys residues. The concentration of the protein was first adjusted to about 10 mg/ml. Dimethylamine-borane complex (ABC; 20 μl of 1 m stock) and formaldehyde (40 μl of 1 m stock) were added per 1 ml of the protein solution. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The procedure was then repeated for the second time. After that, only ABC (10 μl per 1 ml of protein solution) was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight. On the second day, 1 ml of 5 mg/ml glycine and 1 m dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 5 mm were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 2 h. The protein was finally dialyzed against crystallization buffer and concentrated. Ec-MtlR was first treated with trypsin and chymotrypsin and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which shows apparent reduction of molecular mass. The digest was then redone with 100 μg of protein, stopped after 6 h with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The mass of 20,359.6 Da corresponds to a fragment of Ec-MtlR truncated of the first 14 N-terminal amino acids (theoretical mass 20,351 Da). Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex-200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) using AKTATM Xpress. The column was pre-equilibrated with crystallization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and calibrated with premixed protein standards, including ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and blue dextran (2,000 kDa). For each run, a 5-ml protein sample at a 10-mg/ml concentration was injected into the column. The chromatography was carried out at 4 °C at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The calibration curve of Kav versus log molecular weight was prepared using the equation, Kav = Ve − Vo/Vt − Vo, where Ve represents the elution volume for the protein, Vo is column void volume, and Vt is total bed volume. The Se-Met-labeled Vp-MtlR and unmethylated and methylated Sf-YggD proteins were screened for crystallization conditions with the help of the Mosquito robot (TTP Labtech), using the sitting drop vapor-diffusing technique in a 96-well CrystalQuick plate (Greiner). For each condition, 0.4 μl of protein (79 mg/ml for Vp-MtlR and 66 mg/ml for Sf-YggD) and 0.4 μl of crystallization formulation were mixed; the mixture was equilibrated against 135 μl of the reservoir in the well. Crystallization screens used were Index (Hampton Research), Wizard (Emerald Biosystems), and SM4 (Nextal) at both 4 and 18 °C. Diffraction quality crystals of Vp-MtlR appeared under the condition of 0.2 m triammonium citrate, pH 7.0, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. The crystallization condition of methylated Sf-YggD crystals was 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 2000MME. Prior to data collection, crystals were treated with cryoprotectant complemented from crystallization buffer. For Vp-MtlR, 25% (v/v) glycerol was added. For methylated Sf-YggD, 20% (v/v) glycerol was added, and polyethylene glycol 2000MME was reduced to 20%. No crystal was produced from unmethylated Sf-YggD protein. Extensive screenings of crystallization conditions for Ec-MtlR and its proteolytic fragment were also performed, and no crystal was obtained. 80 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled DNA-oligonucleotides were incubated with a 4–10-fold excess of protein in TMD-buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Bovine serum albumin was added in a ratio of 100:1 to the protein under investigation to prevent nonspecific binding. The samples were incubated for 30 min and separated on a vertical polyacrylamide gel. An x-ray film was exposed for 16 h at −70 °C. Additional electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out on a minigel electrophoresis system (Invitrogen) using a Native PAGE™ 4–16% gradient gel (Invitrogen) and Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (see supplemental material). An IASys single channel resonant mirror biosensor (Fisons Applied Sensor Technology, Cambridge, UK) (34.George A.J. French R.R. Glennie M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35.Rubio I. Buckle P. Trutnau H. Wetzker R. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was used to measure the affinity of Ec-MtlR constructs to DNA. The 5′-biotin-labeled oligonucleotides mtlr1_for (5′-CTCGGGCTTCCAGCCTGCG) and mtlr2_for (5′-ACATAAGAAGGGGTGTTTTTATGT) and their complementary strands were obtained from Microsynth, dissolved, and annealed according to the standard procedure. A 100–200-μg excess of streptavidin (Pierce) was coupled to a sensing cuvette manufactured with a biotin layer, and the biotinylated double-stranded DNA was then coupled to the immobilized streptavidin. All binding reactions were performed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 25% glycerol, and a range of additional NaCl concentrations between 100 and 300 mm were tested to optimize the binding. A SELEX-based binding site selection assay was developed for the identification of protein-DNA binding specificities. Wells of Nunc immunoplates were coated with 400 μl of 1 mg/ml concentrations of the proteins under test and incubated for between 1 and 8 h. The wells were washed with Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) prior to the binding reaction. 50 μl of binding reaction buffer containing 200 ng of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) and 0.2 ng of the random oligonucleotide R76 were added to each test well. The oligonucleotide R76 comprised a random 26-base sequence flanked by two 25-nucleotide PCR primers as follows: 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCG(A/G/C/T)26GAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACTGCAGC. Plates were incubated for 4 h with shaking. After the binding reaction, wells were washed thoroughly with buffer E, and the bound DNA was eluted with 250 μl of 500 mm NaCl. 2-μl aliquots of the eluate were amplified by PCR. The amplified DNA was then rebound to the protein from which it was eluted, and the whole binding, elution, and amplification procedure was repeated five times to facilitate greater accuracy in the selection of DNA sequences. The final amplification of the selected DNA sequences was performed using Eppendorf Taq polymerase, which produces 3′-A overhangs and facilitates cloning into the pGEMT Easy vector system (Promega). The blue/white screening was used to select clones containing inserts, and the selected DNA was sequenced. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the 19ID and 19BM beamlines of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory using the program SBCcollect. A multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction data set and a single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data set were collected at the wavelengths near selenium absorption peaks from Se-Met-labeled protein crystals of Vp-MtlR and Sf-YggD, respectively. All data were processed and scaled with the HKL3000 suite (24.Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab The Vp-MtlR and Sf-YggD crystal structures were determined using multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods, respectively. For both structures, selenium sites were first located using the program SHELXD (25.Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar), and they were used for initial phasing with the program MLPHARE (26.CCP4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). After density modification (26.CCP4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), partial models (Vp-MtlR, 378 residues with 26 side chains placed; Sf-YggD, 392 residues with 17 side chains placed) were obtained from automatic model-building trials using the program RESOLVE (27.Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). All of the above programs are integrated within the program suite HKL3000 (24.Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). After cycles of model buildings using the program COOT (28.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar), the models were refined using the program REFMAC (29.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar) (Table 1). After final refinements, electron density calculated at 1.0 σ is well connected for main chains of three Vp-MtlR monomers. There were density breaks between Met-127 and Asp-138 for the fourth Vp-MtlR monomer. In case of Sf-YggD, electron density breaks were observed only at the loop region from residue Phe-137 to residue Lys-142 in three of four monomers. Electron densities were observed for methyl groups of 22 of 32 lysine residues in the methylated Sf-YggD, and these methyl groups were built into the structural model. The recombinant proteins Vp-MtlR and Sf-YggD were overexpressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain and purified to homogeneity using His6 tag-specific immobilized metal affinity chromatography columns as described previously (21.Kim Y. Dementieva I. Zhou M. Wu R. Lezondra L. Quartey P. Joachimiak G. Korolev O. Li H. Joachimiak A. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Sf-YggD was further subjected to reductive methylation of lysine residues to improve crystallization (19.Kim Y. Quartey P. Li H. Volkart L. Hatzos C. Chang C. Nocek B. Cuff M. Osipiuk J. Tan K.

The x-ray diffraction data of Vp-MtlR (2.75 Å) and Sf-YggD (2.50 Å) were both collected near the selenium absorption K-edge of their Se-Met-labeled protein crystals (Table 1) with their structures solved by multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction techniques, respectively (Table 1). The Ec-MtlR and its proteolytic fragment failed to crystallize. There are four monomers in one asymmetric unit of both Vp-MtlR and Sf-YggD crystals (Figs. 1A and 2A). Although different in their molecular packing, the structures of the MtlR and the YggD monomers are highly similar. Each monomer assumes an all α-helical fold rather than the predicted α/β structure of E. coli MtlR (9.Figge R.M. Ramseier T.M. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 840-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Sf-YggD monomer has nine α-helices arranged in three layers (Fig. 2). In Vp-MtlR the α8 helix is replaced by a flexible loop (Figs. 1B and 2C). Except for the short α7 helix within the loop between α6 and α8, all helices that are adjacent in the amino acid sequence are antiparallel. The first layer includes α4, α5, α6, and α8 as well as the short helix α7. The four helices α4, α5, α6, and α8 are antiparallel to each other with a relative rotation of about 20° to each other. The second layer or the central helical sheet includes α2, α3, and α9. The α2 and α9 helices are parallel to each other. They are the longest and the most prominent helices of the structure. The second layer has a rotation of about 50° relative to the first layer. The packing between two adjacent individual α-helices within a helical layer or between two helical layers is largely representative of two typical helix-helix packing modes, with the ridges of one helix fitting into grooves of the other and vice versa (30.Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1991: 36-37Google Scholar). A single N-terminal helix (α1) is stacked onto the second layer, interacting with α2 and α9. The interactions between these three helices are similar to what was observed in a coiled-coil helical structure, although there are only two layers of hydrophobic interactions in both Vp-MtlR and Sf-YggD. Furthermore, the majority of interhelical interactions in both monomers are predominantly hydrophobic in nature, suggesting the high stability of this all α-helical fold.FIGURE 2Crystal packing of Sf-YggD monomers and Sf-YggD dimer.

The cytotoxic T (Tc) cell granule serine-protease, granzyme B, is important for its control, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Using ex vivo virus immune Tc cells, we have previously shown that granzyme B is able to activate several independent pro-apoptotic pathways, including those mediated by Bid/Bak/Bax and caspases-3/-7, in target cells pulsed with Tc cell determinants. Methods and Findings Here we analysed the physiological relevance of those pro-apoptotic pathways in ectromelia infection, by incubating ectromelia-immune ex vivo Tc cells from granzyme A deficient (GzmB+ Tc cells) or granzyme A and granzyme B deficient (GzmA×B−/− Tc cell) mice with ectromelia-infected target cells. We found that gzmB-induced apoptosis was totally blocked in ectromelia infected or peptide pulsed cells lacking caspases-3/-7. However ectromelia inhibited only partially apoptosis in cells deficient for Bid/Bak/Bax and not at all when both pathways were operative suggesting that the virus is able to interfere with apoptosis induced by gzmB in case not all pathways are activated. Importantly, inhibition of viral replication in vitro, as seen with wild type cells, was not affected by the lack of Bid/Bak/Bax but was significantly reduced in caspase-3/-7-deficient cells. Both caspase dependent processes were strictly dependent on gzmB, since Tc cells, lacking both gzms, neither induced apoptosis nor reduced viral titers. Significance Out findings present the first evidence on the biological importance of the independent gzmB-inducible pro-apoptotic pathways in a physiological relevant virus infection model."

Unlike other family members, TG2 is expressed in many tissues and cell types, also functions as a G protein in transmembrane signaling, and acts as a cell surface adhesion mediator (1.Fesus L.

TG2 has been the focus of numerous studies that show it plays an important role in a variety of biological functions including differentiation, apoptosis, signaling, adhesion, migration, wound healing, inflammation, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Although TG2 appears to have many functional domains, studies have mainly concentrated on its cross-linking activity, with little investigation into its non-enzymatic roles (3.Janiak A. Zemskov E.A. Belkin A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1606-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Bcr was originally identified through its involvement in chronic myeloid leukemia (5.Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: Biology and Treatment.in: Carella A.M. Daley G.Q. Eaves C.J. Goldman J.M. Hehlman R. Martin Dunitz, Ltd., London2001: 3-17Google Scholar). Subsequent studies established that it contains a domain with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for the Rho family of small GTPases that includes Rho, Rac and Cdc42 (6.Diekmann D. Brill S. Garrett M.D. Totty N. Hsuan J. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Hall A. Nature. 1991; 351: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Although the purified GAP domain of Bcr and of the highly related Abr are active toward both Rac and Cdc42 in vitro (7.Chuang T.H. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl.

They act as molecular switches that cycle between an active, GTP-bound and an inactive, GDP-bound form. This cycle is tightly controlled by GAPs such as Bcr and Abr, by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). Although many studies have focused on activation of Rho GTPases, the deactivation by GAPs plays an equally important critical role in their regulation (15.Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 16.Bernards A. Settleman J.

Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, loss of the tumor suppressor DLC1, a RhoGAP, is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in man (18.Lahoz A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1724-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).How the GAP activity of such proteins is regulated is not completely understood. The Bcr protein contains multiple domains that could be involved in regulation of the GAP activity. We recently identified a direct interaction with RhoGDI as one regulatory mechanism (19.Kweon S.M. Cho Y.J. Minoo P. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3023-3030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that Bcr is regulated though multiple, different interactions. In an alternative approach to investigate how Bcr is regulated, we sought to identify Bcr-interacting proteins in a yeast two-hybrid screen, using the entire Bcr protein as bait, and isolated TG2. We here report that TG2 functions as a regulator of the BcrGAP activity, and, through it, controls levels of activated Rac. Furthermore, GTP-bound TG2 has reduced affinity for Bcr and reduced ability to inhibit the Bcr GAP activity.DISCUSSIONTG2 is a large multidomain protein with interesting but very complex activity and regulation in vivo and in vitro. A number of studies are consistent with a model in which TG2 exists in at least two distinct conformations, which may be dependent upon the physiological state of a cell. The so-called closed conformation is adopted when TG2 is guanine nucleotide-bound. In this form of TG2, the catalytic core domain is hidden, access to the domain is blocked, and the protein is inactive as transamidase. In contrast, the conformation of guanine nucleotide-free or Ca2+-activated TG2 is open (2.Griffin M. Casadio R. Bergamini C.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 28.Pinkas D.M. Strop P. Brunger A.T. Khosla C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e327Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 29.Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). TG2 mutants such as R580A and S171E are unable to bind guanine nucleotides and are locked in this non-compacted conformation, exposing the catalytic core domain (22.Datta S. Antonyak M.A. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13163-13174Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30.Begg G.E. Carrington L. Stokes P.H. Matthews J.M. Wouters M.A. Husain A. Lorand L. Iismaa S.E. Graham R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19683-19688Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our studies are consistent with a model in which the interaction between Bcr and TG2 is conformation dependent, taking place preferentially with the more open conformation of TG2 (Fig. 5). First, Bcr binds to the catalytic core domain of TG2, which is exposed in the open conformation. Second, the R580A and S171E mutants showed a very strong interaction with Bcr. Third, we found that the binding of TG2 to BcrGAP was increased in the presence of Ca2+ (data not shown). However, although Bcr bound to the TG2 catalytic core, the interaction was independent of the catalytic core domain being active as transamidase.The interaction between Bcr and TG2 was measured under normal physiological conditions, indicating that the more open conformation of TG2 is present in non-stressed cells. Many signal transduction pathways including those of EGF lead to transient increases in intracellular free Ca2+ that could locally induce the open conformation of TG2 (31.Noh D.Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Indeed, Antonyak et al. (21.Antonyak M.A. Li B. Regan A.D. Feng Q. Dusaban S.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17914-17925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) showed that HeLa cells stimulated with EGF contain both GTP-bound TG2 and transamidase-proficient TG2.Interestingly, stimulation of the α1B-adrenergic receptor with epinephrine results in the activation of PLCδ1, the exchange of GDP for GTP on TG2 mediated by PLCδ1, and the release of calcium from intracellular stores (32.Baek K.J. Kang S.K. Damron D. Im M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5591-5597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that TG2 undergoes a number of rapid conformational switches upon cell signaling, with an initially GTP-bound, effector binding state followed by a calcium-bound state that exposes the CD domain for interaction with proteins such as Bcr.Our studies show that TG2 plays a role in the normal regulation of Bcr activity and through it, of Rac activation, and cytoskeletal organization. Although there have been a number of previous reports showing that TG2 can regulate Rho and Rho family-controlled processes, these studies either reported a different molecular mechanism or did not clearly identify one. One mechanism described involves the post-translational modification/transamidation activity of TG2, which may be relatively irreversible: when TG2 is activated by retinoic acid, it can directly modify and activate RhoA by transamidation, resulting in Rho-associated kinase-2 activation (33.Singh U.S. Kunar M.T. Kao Y.L. Baker K.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TG2 can additionally activate Rac1 and RhoA by their transamidation to serotonin (34.Dai Y. Dudek N.L. Patel T.B. Muma N.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 326: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35.Guilluy C. Rolli-Derkinderen M. Tharaux P.L. Melino G. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2918-2928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cell surface TG2 was reported to regulate RhoA activity via a non-enzymatic mechanism involving integrin clustering (3.Janiak A. Zemskov E.A. Belkin A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1606-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Also, Toth et al. (36.Tóth B. Garabuczi E. Sarang Z. Vereb G. Vámosi G. Aeschlimann D. Blaskó B. Bécsi B. Erdõdi F.

J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17914-17925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) recently reported that TG2 is an essential component of EGF-stimulated migration. Interestingly, they showed that the TG2 R580L and C277V mutants, which bind to Bcr, both localize to the leading edge of cells. They speculate that the active site of TG2 may be involved in the direct binding to actin and act as a scaffold for the recruitment of other proteins that influence actin polymerization. This would be consistent with the results of our own studies, which show that TG2 binds to the Rac regulatory protein Bcr.Thus, TG2 clearly is involved in the regulation of Rac, and it will be of interest to determine if the regulation is associated only with maintenance of normal cell homeostasis, or if it can be linked to apoptosis/cell death and/or pathologies such as celiac and neurodegenerative diseases. Our other studies 3N. Heisterkamp, manuscript in preparation. show that TG2 can also use Bcr as a substrate and cross-link it. The combined data will allow us to start to dissect how TG2 regulates Rac under normal and pathological conditions.

TG2 has been the focus of numerous studies that show it plays an important role in a variety of biological functions including differentiation, apoptosis, signaling, adhesion, migration, wound healing, inflammation, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Although TG2 appears to have many functional domains, studies have mainly concentrated on its cross-linking activity, with little investigation into its non-enzymatic roles (3.Janiak A. Zemskov E.A.

Bcr was originally identified through its involvement in chronic myeloid leukemia (5.Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: Biology and Treatment.in: Carella A.M. Daley G.Q. Eaves C.J. Goldman J.M. Hehlman R. Martin Dunitz, Ltd., London2001: 3-17Google Scholar). Subsequent studies established that it contains a domain with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for the Rho family of small GTPases that includes Rho, Rac and Cdc42 (6.Diekmann D. Brill S. Garrett M.D. Totty N. Hsuan J. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Hall A. Nature. 1991; 351: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Although the purified GAP domain of Bcr and of the highly related Abr are active toward both Rac and Cdc42 in vitro (7.Chuang T.H. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10282-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), they only act on Rac in vivo (8.Cho Y.J. Cunnick J.M. Yi S.J. Kaartinen V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell.

Rho family members are critical regulators of a variety of cellular functions including actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, growth, differentiation, and membrane trafficking (11.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 12.Bokoch G.M.

They act as molecular switches that cycle between an active, GTP-bound and an inactive, GDP-bound form. This cycle is tightly controlled by GAPs such as Bcr and Abr, by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). Although many studies have focused on activation of Rho GTPases, the deactivation by GAPs plays an equally important critical role in their regulation (15.Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 16.Bernards A. Settleman J.

Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, loss of the tumor suppressor DLC1, a RhoGAP, is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in man (18.Lahoz A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1724-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). How the GAP activity of such proteins is regulated is not completely understood. The Bcr protein contains multiple domains that could be involved in regulation of the GAP activity. We recently identified a direct interaction with RhoGDI as one regulatory mechanism (19.Kweon S.M. Cho Y.J. Minoo P. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3023-3030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that Bcr is regulated though multiple, different interactions. In an alternative approach to investigate how Bcr is regulated, we sought to identify Bcr-interacting proteins in a yeast two-hybrid screen, using the entire Bcr protein as bait, and isolated TG2. We here report that TG2 functions as a regulator of the BcrGAP activity, and, through it, controls levels of activated Rac. Furthermore, GTP-bound TG2 has reduced affinity for Bcr and reduced ability to inhibit the Bcr GAP activity. DISCUSSIONTG2 is a large multidomain protein with interesting but very complex activity and regulation in vivo and in vitro. A number of studies are consistent with a model in which TG2 exists in at least two distinct conformations, which may be dependent upon the physiological state of a cell. The so-called closed conformation is adopted when TG2 is guanine nucleotide-bound. In this form of TG2, the catalytic core domain is hidden, access to the domain is blocked, and the protein is inactive as transamidase. In contrast, the conformation of guanine nucleotide-free or Ca2+-activated TG2 is open (2.Griffin M. Casadio R. Bergamini C.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 28.Pinkas D.M. Strop P. Brunger A.T. Khosla C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e327Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 29.Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). TG2 mutants such as R580A and S171E are unable to bind guanine nucleotides and are locked in this non-compacted conformation, exposing the catalytic core domain (22.Datta S. Antonyak M.A. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13163-13174Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30.Begg G.E. Carrington L. Stokes P.H. Matthews J.M. Wouters M.A. Husain A. Lorand L. Iismaa S.E. Graham R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19683-19688Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our studies are consistent with a model in which the interaction between Bcr and TG2 is conformation dependent, taking place preferentially with the more open conformation of TG2 (Fig. 5). First, Bcr binds to the catalytic core domain of TG2, which is exposed in the open conformation. Second, the R580A and S171E mutants showed a very strong interaction with Bcr. Third, we found that the binding of TG2 to BcrGAP was increased in the presence of Ca2+ (data not shown). However, although Bcr bound to the TG2 catalytic core, the interaction was independent of the catalytic core domain being active as transamidase.The interaction between Bcr and TG2 was measured under normal physiological conditions, indicating that the more open conformation of TG2 is present in non-stressed cells. Many signal transduction pathways including those of EGF lead to transient increases in intracellular free Ca2+ that could locally induce the open conformation of TG2 (31.Noh D.Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Indeed, Antonyak et al. (21.Antonyak M.A. Li B. Regan A.D. Feng Q. Dusaban S.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17914-17925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) showed that HeLa cells stimulated with EGF contain both GTP-bound TG2 and transamidase-proficient TG2.Interestingly, stimulation of the α1B-adrenergic receptor with epinephrine results in the activation of PLCδ1, the exchange of GDP for GTP on TG2 mediated by PLCδ1, and the release of calcium from intracellular stores (32.Baek K.J. Kang S.K. Damron D. Im M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5591-5597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that TG2 undergoes a number of rapid conformational switches upon cell signaling, with an initially GTP-bound, effector binding state followed by a calcium-bound state that exposes the CD domain for interaction with proteins such as Bcr.Our studies show that TG2 plays a role in the normal regulation of Bcr activity and through it, of Rac activation, and cytoskeletal organization. Although there have been a number of previous reports showing that TG2 can regulate Rho and Rho family-controlled processes, these studies either reported a different molecular mechanism or did not clearly identify one. One mechanism described involves the post-translational modification/transamidation activity of TG2, which may be relatively irreversible: when TG2 is activated by retinoic acid, it can directly modify and activate RhoA by transamidation, resulting in Rho-associated kinase-2 activation (33.Singh U.S. Kunar M.T. Kao Y.L. Baker K.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TG2 can additionally activate Rac1 and RhoA by their transamidation to serotonin (34.Dai Y. Dudek N.L. Patel T.B. Muma N.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 326: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35.Guilluy C. Rolli-Derkinderen M. Tharaux P.L. Melino G. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol.

This would be consistent with the results of our own studies, which show that TG2 binds to the Rac regulatory protein Bcr.Thus, TG2 clearly is involved in the regulation of Rac, and it will be of interest to determine if the regulation is associated only with maintenance of normal cell homeostasis, or if it can be linked to apoptosis/cell death and/or pathologies such as celiac and neurodegenerative diseases.
