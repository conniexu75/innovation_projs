To understand the mechanism of action of trehalose in detail, we have conducted a thorough investigation of its effect on the thermal stability in aqueous solutions of five well characterized proteins differing in their various physico-chemical properties. Among them, RNase A has been used as a model enzyme to investigate the effect of trehalose on the retention of enzymatic activity upon incubation at high temperatures. 2 m trehalose was observed to raise the transition temperature, T m of RNase A by as much as 18 °C and Gibbs free energy by 4.8 kcal mol–1 at pH 2.5. There is a decrease in the heat capacity of protein denaturation (ΔC p) in trehalose solutions for all the studied proteins. An increase in the ΔG and a decrease in the ΔC p values for all the proteins points toward a general mechanism of stabilization due to the elevation and broadening of the stability curve (ΔG versus T). A direct correlation of the surface tension of trehalose solutions and the thermal stability of various proteins has been observed. Wyman linkage analysis indicates that at 1.5 m concentration 4–7 molecules of trehalose are excluded from the vicinity of protein molecules upon denaturation. We further show that an increase in the stability of proteins in the presence of trehalose depends upon the length of the polypeptide chain. The pH dependence data suggest that even though the charge status of a protein contributes significantly, trehalose can be expected to work as a universal stabilizer of protein conformation due to its exceptional effect on the structure and properties of solvent water compared with other sugars and polyols.

Sugars have been known to protect proteins against loss of activity (1Colaco C. Sen S. Thangavelu M. Pinder S. Roser B.

Timasheff S.N. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 25-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Among several sugars, α,α-trehalose (α-d-glucopyranosyl(1→1)-α-d-glucopyranoside) has been known to be a superior stabilizer in providing protection to biological materials against dehydration and desiccation (10Sampedro J.G. Guerra G. Pardo J.P. Uribe S. Cryobiology. 1998; 37: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Sun W.Q. Davidson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1425: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is a compatible osmolyte that gets accumulated in organisms under stress conditions (12Somero G.N. Am. J.

Because of this unique property, tremendous interest has been generated in understanding the molecular basis of stress management through induction of trehalose biosynthesis (13Singer M.A. Lindquist S.

Biol. 1998; 58: 197-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Trehalose has also been found to be very effective in the stabilization of labile proteins during lyophilization (15Carpenter J.F. Prestrelski S.J. Arakawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16Kreilgaard L. Frokjaer S. Flink J.M. Randolph T.W. Carpenter J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 360: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and exposure to high temperatures in solution (2Carninci P. Nishiyama Y. Westover A. Itoh M. Nagaoka S. Sasaki N. Okazaki Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8Lin T.-Y. Timasheff S.N.

Sugars in general protect proteins against dehydration by hydrogen bonding to the dried protein by serving as water substitute (15Carpenter J.F. Prestrelski S.J. Arakawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 17Carpenter J.F. Crowe J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3916-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Several studies carried out by Timasheff and coworkers (9Xie G. Timasheff S.N. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 25-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 18Xie G. Timasheff S.N. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) show that sugars and polyols stabilize the folded structure of proteins in solution as a result of greater preferential hydration of the unfolded state compared with the native state. The mechanism is fundamentally different from stabilization in the dried state and points toward the different origins of protein denaturation under different stress conditions (17Carpenter J.F. Crowe J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3916-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In solution, trehalose has been observed to stabilize RNase A by increasing the surface tension of the medium, which leads to the preferential hydration of the protein (8Lin T.-Y. Timasheff S.N. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9Xie G. Timasheff S.N. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 25-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These studies have been carried out using a representative protein at a few selected conditions only. Different proteins are expected to interact with cosolvent molecules in varied ways depending on their physico-chemical properties. In general, trehalose has been observed to provide protection to different proteins to various extents and the efficacy of protection depends on the nature of the protein (2Carninci P. Nishiyama Y. Westover A. Itoh M. Nagaoka S. Sasaki N. Okazaki Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 4Sola-Penna M. Ferreira-Pereira A. Lemos A.P. Meyer-Fernandes J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Despite the availability of such data, the exact role of proteins and their physico-chemical properties in trehalose-mediated stability is still not clear. Studies done earlier by Gekko (19Gekko K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Gekko K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using polyol osmolytes and free energy of transfer studies, suggested that unfavorable interactions of the amino acid side chains with polyols dominate the stability effect, and peptide-polyol interactions contribute negligibly to the stability mediated by polyols. However, recently, Bolen and coworkers (21Liu Y. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12884-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 22Qu Y. Bolen C.L. Bolen D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9268-9273Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 23Bolen D.W. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), based on carefully conducted transfer studies of amino acids and model compounds, have shown that cumulative interactions between amino acid side chains and osmolytes (including sucrose) favor protein unfolding, whereas their overall stabilization is achieved due to unfavorable peptide-osmolyte interactions. The exact nature of interactions that govern the osmolyte-mediated stability of proteins is, therefore, not yet very clear. Overall, protein stability should depend upon a fine balance between favorable and unfavorable interactions of the native and the denatured protein states with the cosolvent molecules (24Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stabilizing effect would, thus, depend on the nature of both the proteins as well as the cosolvent molecules and generalization of the effect may not be possible. To understand the mechanism of trehalose-mediated thermal stability of proteins in detail, we have studied its effect on the thermal stability of a set of five well characterized globular proteins, viz., ribonuclease A (RNase A), 1The abbreviations used are: RNase A, ribonuclease A; ΔASA, change in accessible surface area; ΔC p, apparent heat capacity of denaturation; ΔH m, enthalpy of denaturation; ΔG 0, Gibbs energy; ΔΔG 0, free energy of stabilization; T m, midpoint of thermal denaturation; α-CTgen, α-chymotrypsinogen; cyt c, cytochrome c; Trp-Inh, Trypsin Inhibitor; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; CD, circular dichroism; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. lysozyme, cytochrome c (cyt c), α-chymotrypsinogen (α-CTgen), and trypsin-inhibitor (Trp-Inh) at varying cosolvent concentrations and pH values. These proteins vary in their molecular size, ranging from 12.3 kDa for cyt c to 25.7 kDa for α-CTgen, their hydrophobicities, and the net charges, with pI values in the range of 4.1 for Trp-Inh to 10.7 for lysozyme. The data have been analyzed in the light of the role of bulk properties of the solvent environment and the physico-chemical properties of proteins. Because trehalose in addition to imparting thermodynamic stability to proteins also helps in the retention of activity of enzymes during storage at high temperatures, we have carried out activity studies for RNase A at elevated temperatures and denaturing conditions to understand the stability-activity relationship of the enzyme in the presence of trehalose. Materials—RNase A (bovine pancreatic), lysozyme (hen egg white, HEW), α-CTgen (bovine pancreatic), cyt c (horse heart, type IV), Trp-Inh (HEW), trehalose, and 2′,3′-cCMP (NH4+ salt) were all from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. All the proteins were dialyzed against distilled de-ionized water and lyophilized followed by drying over P2O5. Glycine and sodium acetate were purchased from E. Merck, India. The pH of the solutions was adjusted on a Radiometer PHM84 research pH meter by adding HCl or NaOH solutions. 20 mm glycine HCl buffer at pH 2.5, 40 mm acetate buffer at pH 4.0, and 20 mm MOPS (Sigma Chemical Co.) buffers at pH 7.0 were used from their stock solutions. The solutions at pH 7.0 were made in the presence of 1.5 m GdmCl (Amresco, Solon, OH). Thermal Denaturation Experiments—For monitoring the unfolding of the tertiary structure, thermal denaturation experiments were carried out using a Cecil 599 UV-visible spectrophotometer to which a linear temperature programmer (CE-247, Cecil) was attached. The concentration of the protein solutions was ∼0.5 mg/ml, except for cyt c where 0.1 mg/ml protein was used. The protein solutions were loaded in a 0.5-ml masked and Teflon-stoppered quartz cuvette (Hellma, Germany). A temperature scan rate of 1 °C/min was used in all the experiments. The wavelengths for monitoring conformational changes related to the tertiary structure were 287 nm for RNase A, 293 nm for α-CTgen, 301 nm for lysozyme, 285 nm for Trp-Inh, and 394 nm for cyt c based on their difference spectra. The reversibility of the thermal transitions recorded for the proteins was ascertained by reheating the protein solutions. To investigate the unfolding of secondary structure elements, thermal denaturation was monitored by far-UV CD measurements using a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter at selected pH conditions, one for each protein, at a scan rate of 1 °C/min. A wavelength of 222 nm was used to specifically probe the opening up of helical regions in the proteins. Analysis of Data—The evaluation of thermodynamic parameters from the thermal denaturation curves was based on the equilibrium constant K, for N ⇔ D conversion for a two-state reversible transition, where N represents the native state and D is the denatured state. The equilibrium constant was deduced from the equation, K=[unfolded]/[native]=(AN-AO)/(AO-AD)(Eq. 1) where A N is the absorbance of the pure native state in the transition zone after extrapolation from the pre-transition region, A D is the corresponding absorbance of the pure denatured state, and A O is the observed absorbance at a temperature in the transition zone. We used all the experimental data points obtained in a transition reaction to fit Equation 2, as follows, and described in detail elsewhere (25Kaushik J.K. Bhat R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 7058-7066Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 26Kaushik J.K. Bhat R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), AO=[AN+AD·exp·(-1/R(ΔHm(1/T-1/Tm)-ΔCp(Tm/T-1+1n(T/Tm)))][1+exp(-1/R(ΔHm(1/T-1/Tm)-ΔCp(Tm/T-1+1n(T/Tm)))](Eq. 2) where R is the gas constant, T m is the midpoint temperature of transition in kelvin, ΔH m is the enthalpy of protein denaturation calculated at the T m, and ΔC p is the apparent heat capacity of protein denaturation. For nonlinear least square analysis a minimum of 50 iterations or more using Marquardt-Levenberg routine as available in the Origin™ software (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) were performed until the fractional change in χ2 value was within the tolerance limit set to 5 × 10–4. All the parameters were floated freely to deduce their values simultaneously from thermal transition curves. RNase A Activity Assay—RNase A catalyzed hydrolysis of 2′,3′-cCMP was measured by the change in the absorbance at 286 nm (27Crook E.M. Mathias A.P. Robin B.R. Biochem. J. 1960; 74: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Two sets of experiments were conducted in the presence of 1.5 m trehalose and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0. In set 1, RNase A was incubated at high temperatures (66 °C and 60 °C, with 1 m GdmCl) for 13 h followed by cooling to room temperature and monitoring the activity by addition of 2′,3′-cCMP from the stock. In set 2, RNase was added to the reaction buffer and allowed to equilibrate at high temperatures (63 °C, 56 °C, and 52 °C, with 1 m GdmCl) at which the activity was monitored by the addition of 2′,3′-cyclic CMP. All the reactions were carried out in a 1.0-ml Teflon-stoppered quartz cuvette. The temperature of the cuvette was maintained by using a programmable thermoelectric cuvette holder. Thermal denaturation experiments were carried out for RNase A, lysozyme, cyt c, α-CTgen, and Trp-Inh in the absence and presence of 1–2 m trehalose at pH 2.5, 4.0, and 7.0 by absorbance measurements. The data have been presented in Fig. 1. The insets in Fig. 1 (A–E) show thermal denaturation of the helical structure of these proteins monitored at 222 nm by CD spectroscopy in the absence and presence of 1 m trehalose. The studies were not feasible at all the pH conditions for the proteins. cyt c is known to be partially denatured at pH 2.5 (28Dyson H.J. Beattie J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2267-2273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and hence the thermal stability studies at this pH were not possible. α-CTgen undergoes aggregation at pH 4.0 and 7.0 at higher temperatures, thereby limiting thermodynamic analysis. In the presence of trehalose, lysozyme at pH 4.0 and 7.0 and cyt c at pH 7.0 undergoes partial aggregation even in the presence of 1.5 m GdmCl. The two-state transition analysis using the van't Hoff equation in these cases was carried out only to determine the approximate values of thermodynamic parameters. Santoro et al. (29Santoro M.M. Liu Y. Khan S.M.A. Hou L.-X. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5278-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) have observed irreversible aggregation of lysozyme in osmolyte solutions, and its inactivation at high temperatures in buffer has also been reported (30Zale S.E. Klibanov A.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5432-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). RNase A in the presence of trehalose undergoes a completely reversible denaturation at pH 2.5 and 4.0. At high trehalose concentrations, however, RNase A solutions at pH 7.0 showed partial aggregation even in the presence of 0.5 m GdmCl and required the addition of 1–1.5 m GdmCl for reversibility in thermal denaturation. It must be pointed out that a two-state cooperative transition has been observed for all the proteins studied. Even though Trp-Inh possesses three tandem homologous domains, only a single cooperative transition has been observed. We have observed that multidomain and multimeric proteins usually undergo irreversible thermal denaturation 2D. P. Kumar and R. Bhat, unpublished data. and hence cannot be studied for the effect of trehalose by either spectroscopic or calorimetric techniques. Effect of Trehalose on the Thermodynamics of Protein Denaturation—Thermodynamic parameters for protein denaturation in trehalose solutions at different conditions, obtained from the data in Fig. 1, have been presented in Table I. ΔT m and ΔΔG 0 are the increments in the midpoint of transition, T m, and Gibbs free energy of stabilization, ΔG 0, respectively. ΔΔG 0 in the presence of trehalose has been calculated at the T m of the control, where ΔG 0 for control is zero. For all the proteins, both ΔT m and ΔΔG 0 increase linearly with an increase in the trehalose concentration. ΔH m and ΔS m were also observed to be increasing with trehalose concentration in the case of RNase A, α-CTgen, Trp-Inh, and cyt c at pH 4.0. However, these parameters show a decrease in the case of lysozyme at pH 4.0 and 7.0, and cyt c at pH 7.0, which could be due to partial irreversible aggregation of the proteins in the post denaturation region. Overall, barring these exceptions involving protein aggregation, trehalose was observed to gradually increase the ΔH m and ΔS m of protein denaturation. The experimental errors in ΔH m were in the range of ±1–4% for RNase and cyt c and ±5–7% for α-CTgen, lysozyme, and Trp-Inh. The error in T m measurements was within ±0.5 °C for all the proteins. The fitting errors were always within the experimental error limits. The CD data presented as insets in Fig. 1 have not been used in Table I. However, the transition temperatures and the various thermodynamic parameters obtained by CD measurements matched well with those evaluated by absorption spectroscopy.Table IThermodynamic parameters for several proteins in aqueous trehalose solutions at various pH valuesCosolventRNase Aα-CTgenLysozymeCytochrome cTmΔTmΔHmΔSmΔΔG 0TmΔTmΔHmΔSmΔΔG 0TmΔTmΔHmΔSmΔΔG 0TmΔTmΔHmΔSmΔΔG 0°C°Ckcal mol-1e.u. ae.u., entropy units (cal k -1 mol-1).kcal mol-1°C°Ckcal mol-1e.u.kcal mol-1°C°Ckcal mol-1e.u.kcal mol-1°C°Ckcal mol-1e.u.kcal mol-1pH 2.5Control38.381.02600.0044.996.33030.0061.198.02930.00Trehalose (1.0 M)46.68.386.02692.1350.35.498.53041.5966.55.494.52781.50(1.5 M)51.613.390.72793.4553.28.3100.43072.4370.69.597.02822.68(2.0 M)56.518.295.32894.4856.411.5109.73333.5674.713.6101.42923.96pH 4.0Control54.294.02870.0073.198.52840.0064.561.51820.00Trehalose (1.0 M)62.48.2102.93072.4279.96.895.12691.8371.26.763.11831.19(1.5 M)66.212.0104.53083.4983.710.694.02632.7978.714.267.01902.56(2.0 M)70.516.3107.13124.7181.917.468.91943.15pH 7.0bSolutions at pH 7.0 also contain 1.5 M GdmCl.Trypsin inhibitorControl46.092.02880.0059.056.51700.0058.594.92860.0048.038.41200.00Trehalose (1.0 M)51.55.596.52971.5865.46.458.21721.0866.98.490.02652.2251.43.434.01050.35(1.5 M)56.910.9103.03123.1974.515.660.51762.5972.914.491.02633.7956.68.635.81090.88(2.0 M)59.313.3106.93223.95>75>16.590.02584.26a e.u., entropy units (cal k -1 mol-1).b Solutions at pH 7.0 also contain 1.5 M GdmCl.

The values are considerably lower than the spectroscopically obtained ΔC p values of 2.07 kcal mol–1 K–1 and 2.2 kcal mol–1 K–1 evaluated by varying the T m of RNase A using GdmCl (26Kaushik J.K. Bhat R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and urea (31Pace C.N. Laurents D.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2520-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), respectively, and calorimetric values of 1.74 kcal mol–1 K–1 in buffer and 2.16 kcal mol–1 K–1 in 1 m GdmCl reported by Liu and Sturtevant (32Liu Y. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3059-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previously, several other osmolytes like sarcosine (29Santoro M.M. Liu Y. Khan S.M.A. Hou L.-X. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5278-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and polyols (25Kaushik J.K. Bhat R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 7058-7066Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have also been observed to decrease the apparent heat capacity of denaturation of globular proteins. Neutral salts, including carboxylic acid salts (26Kaushik J.K. Bhat R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which increase the thermal stability of proteins, also lead to a decrease in the denaturation heat capacity of several proteins just like osmolytes. For proteins other than RNase A, e.g. for α-CTgen and lysozyme at pH 2.5, cyt c at pH 4.0, and Trp-Inh at pH 7.0, ΔH m also increases as a function of T m, though marginally (Table I), and results in much lower ΔC p values than the corresponding values reported for these proteins without trehalose. Solution Surface Tension and Protein Stability— Fig. 3 presents data showing the effect of the surface tension of trehalose solutions on the thermal stability, as monitored by T m of various proteins studied. Surface tension of aqueous trehalose solutions has been observed to increase linearly with the concentration resulting in a slope of 1.34 dyne cm–1 mol–1 at 20 °C (33Kita Y. Arakawa T. Lin T.-Y. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15178-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 3 suggest a good correlation of the effect of the increased surface tension of trehalose solutions with the increase in the T m for all the proteins studied. Studies done by us earlier using a series of polyols (25Kaushik J.K. Bhat R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 7058-7066Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and carboxylic salts (26Kaushik J.K. Bhat R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) also indicate a strong correlation of the surface tension effect with the thermal stability of proteins, suggesting an important role of water and the solvent environment in the stability of proteins. Wyman Linkage and Interaction of Trehalose with Proteins— Trehalose stabilizes proteins by shifting the equilibrium constant in favor of the native state. To analyze the effect of trehalose on the denaturation reaction, the Wyman linkage equation (24Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) given below (Equation 3) was used to determine the relative preferential interaction of trehalose with the two end states of the proteins, d(lnK)/d(lna)=(nD-nN)=Δn(Eq. 3) where K is the equilibrium constant for the conversion reaction N ⇔ D, a is the cosolvent activity, and n D and n N are the numbers of cosolvent molecules bound to the denatured and the native protein molecules, respectively. For approximation, a second order equation was fit to a ln-ln plot of the equilibrium constant versus the trehalose concentration (instead of activity) for various proteins (Fig. 4). The Wyman slope of the tangent, Δn at a point on the curve provides the difference in the cosolvent molecules bound to the denatured and the native protein molecules. The Δn values obtained for various proteins at 1.5 m trehalose concentration vary from –7 to –4. The negative values indicate the preferential exclusion of trehalose from the hydration shell of the protein upon denaturation. The values of Δn extrapolated to 0.1–0.9 m trehalose agree well with those obtained by Xie and Timasheff (9Xie G. Timasheff S.N. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 25-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) for RNase A at similar concentrations Activity of RNase A in the Presence of Trehalose—RNase A was taken as a model enzyme to analyze the effect of trehalose on its bioactivity at high temperatures. The relative activity of RNase A in the presence of trehalose presented in Table II has been calculated by dividing the slopes of the linear zone of the corresponding activity plots by the slope of the data for control (buffer). The stabilization factor, f Nt/f Nc presented in Table II, wherein f Nt is the fraction of the protein in the native state in the trehalose solution and f Nc is the fraction of the native protein in the control buffer, was calculated from the thermal denaturation curves for RNase A in the respective solvent systems at the indicated temperatures. The data indicate a remarkable retention of activity of the enzyme in the presence of trehalose under various conditions of the experiment compared with control. Both the storage (set 1) as well as the operational (set 2) stabilities of the enzyme increased in the presence of trehalose as suggested by activity measurements under different conditions. Interestingly, greater relative retention of activity was observed in the presence of a mixture of 1.5 m trehalose and 1.5 m GdmCl compared with trehalose alone. We have obtained similar results earlier using lysozyme as a model enzyme (34Sangeeta Devi Y. Nair U.B. Bhat R. Prog. Biotechnol. 1998; 15: 263-268Google Scholar).Table IIRelative activities of RNase A in the presence of trehalose at different temperaturesCosolventRelative activitiesSet 1aActivities were measured at 25 °C after 13 h of incubation at the indicated temperatures.Set 2bActivities were measured at the indicated temperatures.66 °C56 °C63 °CTrehalose2.02 ± 0.11.47 ± 0.082.41 ± 0.35(9.64)cParentheses include the value of stabilization factor, f Nt/f Nc.(1.041)(2.82)60 °CaActivities were measured at 25 °C after 13 h of incubation at the indicated temperatures.52 °CbActivities were measured at the indicated temperatures.Trehalose + 1 M3.03 ± 0.13.44 ± 0.05GdmCl(12.3)(1.77)a Activities were measured at 25 °C after 13 h of incubation at the indicated temperatures.b Activities were measured at the indicated temperatures.c Parentheses include the value of stabilization factor, f Nt/f Nc. Open table in a new tab Exceptional Stabilization by Trehalose—Among the various osmolytes selected by nature to counteract deleterious environmental effects, trehalose seems to be exceptional among the compatible osmolytes of the sugar and the polyol series, because it increases the transition temperature (ΔT m) of proteins to a maximal extent. A comparatively high value of ΔT m of 18.2 °C (ΔG 0 ∼ 4.5 kcal mol–1) for RNase A at 2 m concentration of trehalose and pH 2.5 is indicative of this (Table I). This increase is much higher compared with any oth"

https://openalex.org/W2043533977,"A significant fraction of the energy emitted in the early Universe came from very luminous galaxies that are largely hidden at optical wavelengths (because of interstellar dust grains); this energy now forms part of the cosmic background radiation at wavelengths near 1 mm (ref. 1). Some submillimetre (submm) galaxies have been resolved from the background radiation, but they have been difficult to study because of instrumental limitations. This has impeded the determination of their redshifts (z), which is a crucial element in understanding their nature and evolution. Here we report spectroscopic redshifts for ten submm galaxies that were identified using high-resolution radio observations. The median redshift for our sample is 2.4, with a quartile range of 1.9-2.8. This population therefore coexists with the peak activity of quasars, suggesting a close relationship between the growth of massive black holes and luminous dusty galaxies. The space density of submm galaxies at redshifts over 2 is about 1,000 times greater than that of similarly luminous galaxies in the present-day Universe, so they represent an important component of star formation at high redshifts."
https://openalex.org/W1968068922,"During reaction, a catalyst surface usually interacts with a constantly fluctuating mix of reactants, products, 'spectators' that do not participate in the reaction, and species that either promote or inhibit the activity of the catalyst. How molecules adsorb and dissociate under such dynamic conditions is often poorly understood. For example, the dissociative adsorption of the diatomic molecule H2--a central step in many industrially important catalytic processes--is generally assumed to require at least two adjacent and empty atomic adsorption sites (or vacancies). The creation of active sites for H2 dissociation will thus involve the formation of individual vacancies and their subsequent diffusion and aggregation, with the coupling between these events determining the activity of the catalyst surface. But even though active sites are the central component of most reaction models, the processes controlling their formation, and hence the activity of a catalyst surface, have never been captured experimentally. Here we report scanning tunnelling microscopy observations of the transient formation of active sites for the dissociative adsorption of H2 molecules on a palladium (111) surface. We find, contrary to conventional thinking, that two-vacancy sites seem inactive, and that aggregates of three or more hydrogen vacancies are required for efficient H2 dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W2073558178,"Sclerosteosis is a progressive sclerosing bone dysplasia. Sclerostin (the SOST gene) was originally identified as the sclerosteosis-causing gene. However, the physiological role of sclerostin remains to be elucidated. Sclerostin was intensely expressed in developing bones of mouse embryos. Punctuated expression of sclerostin was localized on the surfaces of both intramembranously forming skull bones and endochondrally forming long bones. Sclerostin-positive cells were identified as osteoclasts. Recombinant sclerostin protein produced in cultured cells was efficiently secreted as a monomer. We examined effects of sclerostin on the activity of BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and BMP7 for mouse preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Sclerostin inhibited the BMP6 and BMP7 activity but not the BMP2 and BMP4 activity. Sclerostin bound to BMP6 and BMP7 with high affinity but bound to BMP2 and BMP4 with lower affinity. In conclusion, sclerostin is a novel secreted osteoclast-derived BMP antagonist with unique ligand specificity. We suggest that sclerostin negatively regulates the formation of bone by repressing the differentiation and/or function of osteoblasts induced by BMPs. Since sclerostin expression is confined to the bone-resorbing osteoclast, it provides a mechanism whereby bone apposition is inhibited in the vicinity of resorption.

By linkage analysis of families with these diseases, the disease-causing genes were mapped to the same chromosomal 17q12-q21 region, supporting the hypothesis that both diseases are caused by mutations in the same gene. By the positional cloning strategy, sclerostin (the SOST gene), which was mutated in sclerosteosis patients, was identified (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C.

Sclerostin was found to be expressed in human long bones and cartilage using the polymerase chain reaction. However, the expression of sclerostin in the bones and cartilage was not examined in detail. The pathogenesis and genetics of sclerosteosis suggest that inhibition of sclerostin could lead to increased bone density. This definitely makes sclerostin and its pathway interesting targets for the development of anabolic agents against osteoporosis (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M.

Sclerostin encodes a protein of 213 amino acids with a putative signal peptide for secretion, and sclerostin has six conserved cysteine residues and one conserved glycine residue that are essential to form a cystine knot.

However, the biological activity of sclerostin is not known. Therefore, the physiological role of sclerostin and its mechanism of action remain to be elucidated. We examined the expression of sclerostin in mouse embryonic bones by in situ hybridization and the biological activity of recombinant sclerostin protein. Sclerostin was found to be expressed in osteoclasts both in bones forming directly from mesenchyme and via a cartilage template. We showed that sclerostin encoded a novel secreted osteoclast-derived BMP antagonist with unique ligand specificity. The present findings indicate that sclerostin negatively regulates the formation of bone by repressing the differentiation and/or function of osteoblasts induced by BMPs. Sclerostin apparently links the functions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in bone resorption and bone apposition, respectively, and it therefore provides a novel mechanism for the regulation of bone remodeling. In Situ Hybridization—The embryonic mouse tissues (embryonic day 10 to newborn) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned. Radioactive in situ hybridization procedures for tissue sections were carried out as described (3Wilkinson D. Green J. Copp A.J. Cole D.E. Postimplantation Mammalian Embryos. Oxford University Press, London1990: 155-171Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with [35S]UTP; exposure time was 14 or 28 days. The preparation of the Bsp and MMP-9 RNA probes have been previously described (4Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Munaut C. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1091-1102Google Scholar, 5Rice D.P.C. Kim H.-J. Thesleff I. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1999; 107: 265-275Google Scholar). The sclerostin RNA probe was prepared using mouse sclerostin (SOST) cDNA (680 bp) as a template (2Brunkow M.E. Gardner J.C. Van Ness J. Paeper B.W. Kovacevich B.R. Proll S. Skonier J.E. Zhao L.

Production of Recombinant Mouse Sclerostin in Insect Cells—The mouse sclerostin cDNA with a 75-base pair DNA fragment encoding an E tag (GAPVPYPDPLEPR) and a His6 tag (HHHHHH) at the 3′ terminus of the coding region was constructed in a transfer vector DNA, pBacPAK9. Recombinant baculovirus containing the sclerostin cDNA with the tag sequences was obtained by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with the recombinant pBacPAK9 and a Bsu36I-digested expression vector, BacPak6. High Five cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus were cultured at 27 °C for 72 h in Grace's insect cell culture medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant mouse sclerostin was purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and desalted by gel filtration chromatography using Bio-Gel P-6 DG in PBS containing 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Detection of Recombinant Mouse Sclerostin by Western Blotting Analysis—The culture medium and cell lysate of High Five cells infected with recombinant baculovirus were separated by SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL). The protein with the E tag on the membrane was visualized as described (6Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Google Scholar). Purified recombinant mouse sclerostin protein (∼0.35 μg) was separated by SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Prestained Protein Marker Broad Range (New England Biolabs) was used as molecular mass standard proteins. MC3T3-E1 Cell Culture—Mouse preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained and subcultured for 3 or 4 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air in α-modified minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified CO2 incubator. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity in MC3T3-E1 Cells—For determination of alkaline phosphatase activity, MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 48-well plates. After the cells had reached confluence, the medium was replaced with α-minimum essential medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and cells were cultured for 24 h. The cells were then cultured in α-minimum essential medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 ng/ml recombinant human BMP2 (25 ng/ml), BMP4 (10 ng/ml), BMP6 (10 ng/ml), or BMP7 (25 ng/ml) protein (R&D Systems), either and 0–100 ng/ml recombinant mouse sclerostin protein or 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse noggin/Fc chimera (R&D Systems) for 72 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped in 10 mm Tris-HCl-containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 8.2. The cell suspensions were sonicated on ice. Aliquots of supernatants were assayed for protein concentration and alkaline phosphatase activity as described (7Takeuchi Y. Suzuwa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Google Scholar). For the alkaline phosphatase activity, the assay mixture contained 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10, supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2, and was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After 0.1 m NaOH was added, the amount of p-nitrophenol liberated was measured using a spectrophotometer. Binding of Sclerostin to BMPs Examined Using the BIAcore System— Recombinant mouse sclerostin protein was fixed on a carboxymethyl (CM5) sensor tip (Amersham Biosciences). The binding of BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, or BMP7 to the sclerostin on the tip was analyzed using the BIAcore 2000 system (Amersham Biosciences). The equilibrium dissociation constant was determined using the BIA evaluation software (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of Sclerostin during Bone Formation—Since sclerosteosis affects bone modeling and remodeling in the skull (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K. Vickery B. Foernzler D. Van Hul W. Hum. Mol.

Galas D. Hamersma H. Beighton P. Mulligan J.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 577-589Google Scholar), we examined the expression of sclerostin mRNA in the developing skull of mouse embryos by in situ hybridization. Most skull bones develop directly from the mesenchyme by the mechanism of intramembranous bone formation. The initiation of many craniofacial bones is evident in embryonic day 13 (E13) mouse embryos. However, no sclerostin mRNA expression was seen in the head mesenchyme in frontal sections of E11–E13 embryos (Fig. 1A and data not shown). First cells expressing sclerostin mRNA were detected at E14 at the sites of osteogenesis (data not shown). Sclerostin mRNA expression increased at E15, and it appeared as bright punctuated expression in the developing mandibular and maxillary bones (Fig. 1B). The sclerostin mRNA-expressing cells were clearly localized on the surfaces of forming bones, but they covered only some parts of the developing bones. This is shown by the expression pattern of the osteoblast marker gene bone sialoprotein (Bsp), which covers the total area of bone formation (Fig. 1C). In newborn mice, sclerostin mRNA-expressing cells were located in all developing bones in the head. Isolated cells expressing sclerostin mRNA were present on the surfaces of the forming calvarial bones and in the palatal bone (Fig. 1D). Expression was particularly intense in the bone surrounding the growing tooth germs (Fig. 1D). Since sclerosteosis also affects bone modeling and remodeling in the diaphyseal region of long bones (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K. Vickery B. Foernzler D. Van Hul W. Hum. Mol.

Galas D. Hamersma H. Beighton P. Mulligan J.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 577-589Google Scholar), we examined the expression of sclerostin mRNA in developing long bones and other endochondral bones of mouse embryos by in situ hybridization. In the tibia at E16, sclerostin mRNA was mainly detected in the perichondrium of the hypertrophic chondrocyte region and the periosteum of the diaphyseal region (Fig. 1E). In the tibia at E18, sclerostin mRNA was detected in the trabecular bone in addition to the perichondrium and periosteum. We also examined the expression of sclerostin mRNA in other endochondrally developing bones including the radius and iliac bone. The expression profile in each of these bones was essentially similar to that in the tibia (data not shown). In addition, sclerostin mRNA-expressing cells were located around the rib cartilage (Fig. 1F). Sclerostin mRNA expression was largely restricted to the bones, and most other tissues in the sections of E11–E13 whole embryos were negative. Strong expression was found in the endothelium of the pharyngeal artery in E11 embryos (Fig. 1A). In addition, expression was seen in the liver of E12 embryos, and it was localized to islands of hematopoietic cells (Fig. 1G). Coexpression of Sclerostin with MMP-9 —Although the sclerostin mRNA-expressing cells were colocalized with osteoblasts on the surfaces of forming bones, their distribution was restricted only to some areas of bone formation. Sclerostin mRNA expression was also clearly punctuated, and it appeared to localize to isolated large cells. This distribution resembled that of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. The matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 has been shown to be a marker of osteoclasts, in particular in the developing bones (4Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Munaut C. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1091-1102Google Scholar, 8Rice D.P.C. Kim H-J. Thesleff I. Bone. 1997; 21: 479-486Google Scholar). Comparison of the patterns of MMP-9 mRNA- and sclerostin mRNA-expressing cells in the intramembranously forming bones in the embryonic heads showed that the patterns were strikingly similar (Fig. 2). This indicates that sclerostin mRNA is expressed in osteoclasts. The distribution of sclerostin mRNA in the long bones (Fig. 1E) is also similar to that of MMP-9 mRNA (4Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Munaut C. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1091-1102Google Scholar) but not to that of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-13 mRNA, a marker of osteoblasts (9Stricker S. Fundele R. Vortkamp A. Mundlos S. Dev. Biol. 2002; 245: 95-108Google Scholar). Hence, sclerostin mRNA is expressed in osteoclasts also in the long bones. Production of Recombinant Mouse Sclerostin—Sclerostin is a putative secreted protein with a putative secreted signal peptide (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K. Vickery B. Foernzler D. Van Hul W. Hum. Mol.

Galas D. Hamersma H. Beighton P. Mulligan J.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 577-589Google Scholar). To examine whether sclerostin is a secreted protein, mouse sclerostin cDNA was expressed in cultured High Five insect cells by infection with recombinant baculovirus containing the mouse sclerostin cDNA with the 3′-terminal extension encoding E and His6 tags. To detect recombinant mouse sclerostin, both the culture medium and cell lysate were examined by reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting analysis with anti-E tag antibodies. Two major bands with similar molecular masses of ∼28–29 kDa were detected in the culture medium but not in the cell lysate, demonstrating that sclerostin is a secreted protein (Fig. 3A). The observed values were larger than the calculated molecular mass of recombinant sclerostin (23.3 kDa). Since sclerostin has possible N-glycosylation sites at positions 51 (Asn) and 175 (Asn) (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P.

Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 577-589Google Scholar), it might be glycosylated. The two major bands of sclerostin might result from the heterogeneity of glycosylation. We also examined mouse recombinant sclerostin by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting analysis. Sclerostin migrated as a monomer, indicating that it was secreted as a monomer (Fig. 3A). Recombinant mouse sclerostin was purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose followed by gel filtration. Purified recombinant sclerostin was examined by reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by protein staining. Purified sclerostin also showed two major bands of ∼28–29 kDa (Fig. 3B). Effects of Sclerostin on BMP Signaling in Cultured Osteoblasts—Sclerostin is a member of the cystine knot family. The spacing of cysteine residues in sclerostin is highly homologous to that of BMP antagonists, DAN, cerberus and gremlin, of the DAN/cerberus family, indicating that sclerostin might be a BMP antagonist (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K.

BMPs were originally identified as proteins in bone that induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in vivo. BMPs are signaling molecules for the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation (10Raddi A.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Google Scholar, 11Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Google Scholar). We examined effects of sclerostin on the activity of BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and BMP7 for the differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells by determining alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker for osteoblast differentiation (12Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Google Scholar). BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and BMP7 greatly stimulated the alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 4). We examined effects of recombinant sclerostin protein on the BMP activity. The activity of BMP6 was inhibited by sclerostin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). The activity of BMP7 was weakly but significantly inhibited by sclerostin (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the activity of BMP2 and BMP4 was not inhibited by sclerostin (Fig. 4, C and D). Noggin, a BMP antagonist, is known to antagonize BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7, with a higher activity for BMP2 and BMP4 (13Zimmerman L.B. De Jesus-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Google Scholar). We also examined the effect of recombinant mouse noggin protein on the BMP activity. In contrast to sclerostin, noggin significantly antagonized the activity of BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and BMP7, with a higher activity for BMP2 and BMP4 (Fig. 4). Binding of Sclerostin to BMPs—Since sclerostin significantly inhibited the activity of BMP6, we examined the binding of sclerostin to BMP6 using the BIAcore system with the recombinant sclerostin protein-fixed sensor tip. Typical binding and dissociation curves of BMP6 were obtained (Fig. 5). The equilibrium dissociation constant was also determined. Sclerostin was found to bind to BMP6 with high affinity (Table I). We also examined the binding of sclerostin to BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7. Although typical binding and dissociation curves were also obtained (data not shown), sclerostin was found to bind to BMP7 with lower affinity and to BMP2 and BMP4 with much lower affinity (Table I).Table IBinding of sclerostin to BMPskdkaKdS-1M-1·S-1MBMP64.72 × 10-38.27 × 1045.71 × 10-8BMP72.61 × 10-32.98 × 1048.76 × 10-8BMP22.54 × 10-32.53 × 10410.0 × 10-8BMP44.62 × 10-32.06 × 10522.4 × 10-8 Open table in a new tab Sclerosteosis is a progressive sclerosing bone dysplasia characterized by massive bone overgrowth with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The disorder affects bone modeling and remodeling, especially in the skull and diaphyseal region of long bones (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K. Vickery B. Foernzler D. Van Hul W. Hum. Mol.

Galas D. Hamersma H. Beighton P. Mulligan J.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 577-589Google Scholar). Elevated alkaline phosphatase activity and increased rates of bone formation have suggested a defect in osteoblast function. Sclerostin (the SOST gene) was originally identified by positional cloning of the disease-causing gene in sclerosteosis. Therefore, inhibition of sclerostin was expected to lead to increased bone density, definitely making sclerostin and its pathway interesting targets for the development of anabolic agents against osteoporosis (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K.

Alisch R.S. Gillett L. Colbert T. Tacconi P. Galas D. Hamersma H. Beighton P. Mulligan J.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 577-589Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of sclerostin and its mechanism of action remain to be elucidated. Bones are formed through two distinct developmental processes, intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification (14Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Google Scholar, 15Ornitz D.M. Marie P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1446-1465Google Scholar). Formation of most skull bones is achieved by intramembranous ossification, whereas the rest of the skeleton including long bones and vertebrae develop through the process of endochondral ossification in which cartilage is converted into bone. Since both skull bones and long bones are affected in the sclerosteosis patients, sclerostin is apparently involved in both intramembraneous and endochondral bone formation (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K. Vickery B. Foernzler D. Van Hul W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 537-543Google Scholar, 2Brunkow M.E. Gardner J.C. Van Ness J. Paeper B.W. Kovacevich B.R. Proll S. Skonier J.E. Zhao L. Sabo P.J. Fu Y. Alisch R.S. Gillett L. Colbert T. Tacconi P. Galas D. Hamersma H. Beighton P. Mulligan J.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 577-589Google Scholar). Sclerostin was expressed on the surfaces of forming intramembranous bones in the embryonic mouse head. The intramembranous bones are initiated as condensates of mesenchymal cells. The cells differentiate directly to osteoblasts and secrete the extracellular matrix of bone, which subsequently mineralizes. The advancing development is characterized by the process of bone remodeling where the shaping of the bone is regulated by localized bone resorption by osteoclasts and apposition by osteoblasts. As in the skull bones, sclerostin was also expressed in the long bones. Cartilage is formed by condensation of mesenchymal cells. Growth plate chondrocytes are arranged into columns that develop sequentially. Distal hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo apoptosis, and the cartilage is replaced by trabecular bone. In a separate process, cortical bone is generated via an intramembraneous mechanism by osteoblasts derived from osteoprogenitor cells in the perichondrium (14Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Google Scholar, 15Ornitz D.M. Marie P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1446-1465Google Scholar). Sclerostin is expressed in the perichondrium of the hypertrophic chondrocyte region as well as the periosteum and trabecular bone of the diaphyseal region. This indicated that sclerostin was expressed at the sites of bone formation in developing long bones. Sclerostin was not expressed in any regions of the cartilaginous primordium except for the perichondrium of the hypertrophic chondrocyte region. These observations indicate that sclerostin plays a role in osteogenesis but not in chondrogenesis in the development of long bones. Sclerostin was also absent from the cartilaginous tissue in the head as well as ribs. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells differentiating from the hematopoietic precursors, and they express a variety of enzymes degrading the bone matrix and dissolving the mineral. Interestingly, the expression of sclerostin was confined to the osteoclasts but not to osteoblasts. We identified the osteoclasts in forming craniofacial bones by the detection of the expression of MMP-9, a matrix metalloproteinase that is specifically expressed in osteoclasts (4Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Munaut C. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1091-1102Google Scholar). A traditional marker for osteoclasts is TRAP, the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, which is intensely expressed by the active osteoclasts resorbing mineralized bone. Although MMP-9 and TRAP expression largely overlap in osteoclasts, their expression depends on the developmental stage of bone (8Rice D.P.C. Kim H-J. Thesleff I. Bone. 1997; 21: 479-486Google Scholar). Whereas the osteoclasts resorbing mature bone are mostly TRAP-positive but MMP-9-negative, the osteoclasts degrading immature and nonmineralized bone during early bone development are MMP-9-positive and mostly TRAP-negative. Since sclerostin was expressed very early during intramembranous bone development, we compared its expression with MMP-9 and showed that the two genes were apparently localized to the same cells. We therefore conclude that sclerostin is expressed in osteoclasts. Interestingly, intense sclerostin expression was seen in the embryonic liver in hematopoietic cells, which are progenitors of osteoclasts. Since sclerostin has a putative signal sequence at its amino terminus, it is expected to be a secreted protein (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K. Vickery B. Foernzler D. Van Hul W. Hum. Mol.

Galas D. Hamersma H. Beighton P. Mulligan J.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 577-589Google Scholar). We expressed mouse sclerostin in cultured cells. Recombinant sclerostin protein was efficiently secreted. Sclerostin has six conserved cysteine residues and one conserved glycine residue that are essential to form the cystine knot (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K.

Alisch R.S. Gillett L. Colbert T. Tacconi P. Galas D. Hamersma H. Beighton P. Mulligan J.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 577-589Google Scholar). Most cystine knot proteins are secreted as dimers (16Isaacs N.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 391-395Google Scholar). The spacing of cysteine residues in sclerostin is highly homologous to that of BMP antagonists of the DAN/cerberus family. Cerberus and DAN, members of the DAN/cerberus family, are also secreted as homodimers (17Biben C. Stanley E. Fabri L. Kotecha S. Rhinn M. Drinkwater C. Lah M. Wang C.C. Nash A. Hilton D. Ang S.L. Mohun T. Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 135-151Google Scholar, 18Stanley E. Biben C. Kotecha S. Fabri L. Tajbakhsh S. Wang C.C. Hatzistavrou T. Roberts B. Drinkwater C. Lah M. Buckingham M. Hilton D. Nash A. Mohun T. Harvey R.P. Mech. Dev. 1998; 77: 173-184Google Scholar). They have an additional cysteine residue that is potentially used for dimerization. However, sclerostin does not have this cysteine residue. Recombinant sclerostin was found to be secreted as a monomer. The similarity of the spacing of cysteine residues in sclerostin to that in the DAN/cerberus family also indicates that sclerostin might be a BMP antagonist (1Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K. Vickery B. Foernzler D.

Colbert T. Tacconi P. Galas D. Hamersma H. Beighton P. Mulligan J.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 577-589Google Scholar). BMPs are multi-functional molecules involved in morphogenesis during development. BMPs are also local signaling molecules for the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation (10Raddi A.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Google Scholar, 11Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Google Scholar). BMPs are known to stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker for osteoblast differentiation, in mouse preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells (12Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Google Scholar). The BMP family members can be divided into subgroups based on their structural similarities. BMP2 and BMP4 form one group. BMP5, BMP6, BMP7, and BMP8 form another group (19Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3519-3527Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of sclerostin on the activity of BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and BMP7 for the differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells by determining the alkaline phosphatase activity. Sclerostin was found to have significant inhibitory activity for BMP6 and weaker inhibitory activity for BMP7 and essentially none for BMP2 and BMP4. We also examined the binding of sclerostin to these BMPs using the BIAcore system. Sclerostin was found to bind to BMP6 with high affinity. In contrast, sclerostin bound to BMP7 with lower affinity and to BMP2 and BMP4 with much lower affinity. These results were essentially consistent with those of the inhibition experiments. Therefore, sclerostin appears to act as a BMP antagonist by binding extracellularly to BMP. Noggin, a BMP antagonist, was originally isolated from Xenopus laevis based upon an ability to rescue dorsal development in embryos ventralized by UV treatment. Noggin is known to bind and antagonize BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7, with a higher affinity for BMP2 and BMP4 (13Zimmerman L.B. De Jesus-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Google Scholar). Our results also indicate that noggin can significantly antagonize BMP2 and BMP4 and more weakly antagonize BMP6 and BMP7. Chordin, a BMP antagonist, plays major roles in the formation of the dorsoventral axis. Chordin also binds BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 in a way similar to noggin (20Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Google Scholar). DAN, cerberus, and gremlin, members of the DAN/cerberus family, are also known to bind and antagonize BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 (21Dionne M.S. Skarnes W.C. Harland R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 636-643Google Scholar, 22Yokouchi Y. Vogan K.J. Pearse II, R.V. Tabin C. Cell. 1999; 98: 573-583Google Scholar, 23Hsu D.R. Economides A.N. Wang X. Eimon P.M. Harland R.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 673-683Google Scholar). These results indicate that sclerostin is a novel BMP antagonist with unique ligand specificity. BMP6–/– mice were viable and fertile, but the examination of skeletogenesis in late gestation embryos revealed a consistent delay in ossification strictly confined to the developing sternum (24Solloway M.J. Dudley A.T. Bikoff E.K. Lyons K.M. Hogan B.L.M. Robertson E. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 321-339Google Scholar). In situ hybridization studies have indicated that BMP6 is expressed in overlapping patterns with other BMP genes in developing bones. Hence, it is possible that other BMPs may functionally compensate for BMP6 in the null mice (24Solloway M.J. Dudley A.T. Bikoff E.K. Lyons K.M. Hogan B.L.M. Robertson E. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 321-339Google Scholar). In conclusion, sclerostin is a novel secreted BMP antagonist with unique ligand specificity, and its expression is confined to osteoclasts in both endochondral and intramembranous bones. To our knowledge, sclerostin is the first BMP antagonist that is localized in osteoclasts. We suggest that sclerostin plays a specific role in bone development and that it negatively regulates the formation of bone by repressing the BMP-induced differentiation and/or function of osteoblasts. Sclerostin appears to provide a mechanism whereby bone apposition is prevented locally in the vicinity of bone resorption. Sclerostin thereby links the processes of resorption and apposition via a previously unknown mechanism. The importance of communication between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is known to have an important role in the regulation of resorption, as exemplified by the regulation of osteoclast differentiation by the RANK ligand OPGL (a tumor necrosis family cytokine) expressed by osteoblasts (25Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S. Tomoyasu A. Yano K. Goto M. Murakami A. Tusda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Google Scholar). The present findings provide a novel insight into osteogenesis and in particular into the interaction of osteoclast and osteoblast functions during bone remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2001838995,"Multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) belongs to the ATP binding cassette family of transporters. Its substrates include organic anions and anticancer drugs. We have used transport assays with vesicles derived from Sf9 insect cells overproducing MRP2 to study the interactions of drugs, organic anions, and bile acids with three MRP2 substrates: estradiol-17-β-d-glucuronide (E217βG), methotrexate, and glutathione-S-dinitrophenol. Complex inhibition and stimulation patterns were obtained, different from those observed with the related transporters MRP1 and MRP3. In contrast to a previous report, we found that the rate of E217βG transport by MRP2 increases sigmoidally with substrate concentration indicative of homotropic cooperativity. Half-maximal transport was obtained at 120 μm E217βG, in contrast to values < 20 μm for MRP1 and 3. MRP2 stimulators, such as indomethacin and sulfanitran, strongly increased the affinity of MRP2 for E217βG (half-maximal transport rates at 65 and 16 μm E217βG, respectively) and shifted the sigmoidal dependence of transport rate on substrate concentration to a more hyperbolic one, without substantially affecting the maximal transport rate. Sulfanitran also stimulated MRP2 activity in cells, i.e. the transport of saquinavir through monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells. Some compounds that stimulate E217βG transport, such as penicillin G or pantoprazole, are not detectably transported by MRP2, suggesting that they allosterically stimulate transport without being cotransported with E217βG. We propose that MRP2 contains two similar but nonidentical ligand binding sites: one site from which substrate is transported and a second site that regulates the affinity of the transport site for the substrate.

Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Google Scholar) contains multidrug resistance proteins 1–9 (MRP1–9) along with SUR1, SUR2, and CFTR (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev.

Interest in the multidrug resistance proteins was sparked by their possible involvement in the clinical resistance of tumors to chemotherapeutic agents. The first member of this family to be cloned, MRP1, confers resistance to a broad spectrum of anticancer drugs when overproduced in cells (6Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E.

A common feature of MRPs is that they transport a wide variety of organic anions and compounds that are conjugated with sulfate, glucuronate, or glutathione (GSH) (7Jedlitschky G. Leier I.

MRPs are large membrane-associated proteins, and their structural analysis has proven difficult (11Varadi A. Tusnady G.E. Sarkadi B. Holland I.B. Cole S.P. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins from Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, London2002: 37-46Google Scholar). Although several high resolution structures of bacterial ABC transporters have been determined (12Hung L.W.

Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Google Scholar), only low resolution structures are available for the drug transporters MRP1 and MDR1 P-glycoprotein (14Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F.

In the absence of a detailed structure, the mechanism of transport has been inferred from a combination of transport, binding and mutational studies.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Google Scholar), but their tissue localizations differ. MRP1 is localized in the basolateral membranes of polarized cells and is present in all tissues, whereas MRP2 is found in the apical membranes of polarized cells and is expressed mainly in the liver, kidney, and intestine. Bakos et al. (25Bakos E. Evers R. Sinko E. Varadi A. Borst P. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Google Scholar) demonstrated in vesicular transport assays that transport of the GSH conjugate of N-ethylmaleimide by MRP2 is stimulated by several organic anions. Experiments with polarized cells led to a model in which MRP2 cotransports drugs from two distinct drug binding sites (26Evers R. de Haas M. Sparidans R. Beijnen J. Wielinga P.R. Lankelma J. Borst P. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 375-383Google Scholar). Cotransport cannot account for recent observations on MRP1, however (27Leslie E.M. Ito K. Upadhyaya P. Hecht S.S. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27846-27854Google Scholar). In vectorial transport assays with MDCKII/MRP2 cells we recently observed that the transport of saquinavir is stimulated by probenecid (28Huisman M.T. Smit J.W. Crommentuyn K.M. Zelcer N. Wiltshire H.R. Beijnen J.H. Schinkel A.H. Aids. 2002; 16: 2295-2301Google Scholar). Such drug interactions could potentially affect the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of drugs transported by MRP2. We have therefore studied drug interactions with MRP2 more in detail using transport assays with membrane vesicles from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells that were infected with a baculovirus construct containing MRP2 (25Bakos E. Evers R. Sinko E. Varadi A. Borst P. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Google Scholar). Using estradiol-17-β-d-glucuronide (E217βG), methotrexate (MTX), and glutathione-S-dinitrophenol (GS-DNP) as model substrates, we found stimulation of substrate transport by a range of compounds. We propose that MRP2 contains two distinguishable binding sites: one site from which drug is transported and a second site that allosterically regulates the former. Analogous results have been independently obtained by Bodo and colleagues and are presented in the accompanying manuscript. Materials—40.5 Ci/mmol [3H]E217βG, 21 Ci/mmol [3H]penicillin G, and 20 mCi/mmol [14C]indomethacin were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 9 Ci/mmol [3H]MTX was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. 13.6 μCi/mg [14C]saquinavir was from Roche Applied Science. Vials of omeprazole (Losec®, AstraZeneca) and pantoprazole (Pantozol, Altana Pharma BV) were obtained from the pharmacy of The Netherlands Cancer Institute and dissolved in saline according to the manufacturers' instructions. Creatine phosphate and creatine kinase were obtained from Roche, and RC-L55 and OE-67 filters were from Schleicher & Schuell. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Sf9 insect cells in suspension were grown in Sf-900 II SFM medium in the absence of serum (Invitrogen). The MDCKII control and MRP2-overproducing lines were described previously (24Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Google Scholar) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin/ml. Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 under humidifying conditions. Protein Analysis and Immunoblotting—Membrane vesicle preparations were diluted in buffer (10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), supplemented by a mixture of protease inhibitors used at the concentration recommended by the manufacturer (Roche). The indicated amount of protein was size fractionized on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently blotted overnight in a tank blotting system. MRP1, 2, and 3 were detected with the monoclonal antibodies MRP-r1 (1:1000), M2II5 (1:250) and M3II9 (1:250), respectively, as described previously (24Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Google Scholar, 29Zelcer N. Saeki T. Reid G. Beijnen J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46400-46407Google Scholar). Signals were visualized with chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Transepithelial Transport Assays—Transepithelial transport assays were done as described previously (28Huisman M.T. Smit J.W. Crommentuyn K.M. Zelcer N. Wiltshire H.R. Beijnen J.H. Schinkel A.H. Aids. 2002; 16: 2295-2301Google Scholar). Briefly, Cells were seeded on microporous polycarbonate membrane filters (Transwell 3414, Costar, Corning, NY) at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/well in 2 ml of complete medium. Cells were grown for 3 days with medium replacements every day. 2 h before the start of the experiment, complete medium was replaced from both compartments with Opti-MEM, without serum containing 5 μm GF120918 and the appropriate concentration of transport modulators. At t = 0 h the experiment was started by replacing the medium from both compartments containing 5 μm appropriate radiolabeled drug (∼ 3 kBq/well) and either 3H- or 14C-labeled inulin (∼ 3 kBq/well) in the appropriate compartment. The latter compound was added to check for leakage through the cell layers. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and 50-μl aliquots were taken each hour. The radioactivity in these aliquots was measured by the addition of 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Ultima-gold; Packard, Meriden, CT) and subsequent liquid scintillation counting. Inulin leakage did not exceed 3% over 4 h. The percentage of radioactivity appearing in the opposite compartment, of the total amount initially applied, was measured and plotted. The amount of radiolabeled drug in the cell layer at the end of the experiment was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the excised filter, after washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Preparation of Membrane Vesicles—Membrane vesicles from Sf9 cells were obtained after infection with an MRP1 (25Bakos E. Evers R. Sinko E. Varadi A. Borst P. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Google Scholar), MRP2 (25Bakos E. Evers R. Sinko E. Varadi A. Borst P. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Google Scholar), MRP3 (29Zelcer N. Saeki T. Reid G. Beijnen J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46400-46407Google Scholar), or MRP4 (30van Aubel R.A. Smeets P.H. Peters J.G. Bindels R.J. Russel F.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 595-603Google Scholar, 31Zelcer N. Reid G. Wielinga P. Kuil A. Van Der Heijden I. Schuetz J.D. Borst P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 361-367Google Scholar) cDNA-containing baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. After incubation at 27 °C for 3 days, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (0.5 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin) and incubated at 4 °C for 90 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C at 100,000 × g for 40 min, and the pellet was homogenized in ice-cold TS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) using a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged at 4 °C at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The pellet was resuspended in TS buffer and passed through a 27-gauge needle 25 times. The vesicles were dispensed in aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Vesicular Transport Assays—Vesicular transport assays were performed in buffer consisting of 100 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, in the presence or absence of 4 mm ATP (32Heijn M. Hooijberg J.H. Scheffer G.L. Szabo G. Westerhoff H.V. Lankelma J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1326: 12-22Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with a Tris/sucrose buffer (not shown). The time- and concentration-dependent uptake of substrates into membrane vesicles was studied following the rapid filtration method as described previously (29Zelcer N. Saeki T. Reid G. Beijnen J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46400-46407Google Scholar). For all results presented here, accumulation of substrate increased with time for at least 10 min and was dependent on the presence of ATP. The ATP-dependent transport was calculated by subtracting the transport in the absence of ATP from that in its presence. In experiments where the effect of GSH on transport was studied, 10 mm dithiothreitol was in the reaction mixture. Concentration-dependent uptake was analyzed using a nonlinear regression algorithm. Effects of Drugs and Organic Anions on E217βG Transport by MRP2—Membrane vesicles were prepared from Sf9 insect cells transfected with a recombinant baculovirus coding for human MRP2. These vesicles contain high levels of MRP2 (Fig. 1) and were used to study the effect of various organic anions and commonly used drugs on the transport of 1 μm E217βG by MRP2. The compounds tested could be divided into four classes based on their interaction with MRP2: 1) compounds that only showed a stimulatory effect at the concentrations tested (Fig. 2, A and B); 2) compounds that stimulated transport at low concentrations but showed a decrease in their stimulation capacity at higher concentrations (Fig. 2, C and D); 3) compounds that only inhibited transport (Fig. 2E); and 4) compounds that had no substantial effect on the transport of E217βG by MRP2 (Fig. 2F).Fig. 2Effects of organic anions and drugs on the transport of 1 μm E217βG by MRP2. Membrane vesicles containing MRP2 were incubated with 1 μm [3H]E217βG for 2 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of the indicated compounds. The ATP-dependent transport is plotted as a percentage of the control value. Each point and error are the mean ± S.E. of experiments in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sulfanitran, the strongest stimulator of MRP2-mediated E217βG transport, also stimulated the vectorial transport of saquinavir, a recently described MRP2 substrate (28Huisman M.T. Smit J.W. Crommentuyn K.M. Zelcer N. Wiltshire H.R. Beijnen J.H. Schinkel A.H. Aids. 2002; 16: 2295-2301Google Scholar), across polarized MDCKII monolayers demonstrating that it also stimulates MRP2 in intact cells (Fig. 3). Comparison of B and D of Fig. 3 shows that sulfanitran increases transport of saquinavir in the apical direction, decreases transport in the basolateral direction, and substantially decreases the intracellular concentration of saquinavir. Saquinavir is too hydrophobic to study in the vesicular transport assay, but in transepithelial transport assays, we have shown previously that in addition to sulfanitran, other stimulators of vesicular transport also stimulate MRP2 in intact cells: transport of saquinavir is stimulated by both sulfinpyrazone and probenecid (28Huisman M.T. Smit J.W. Crommentuyn K.M. Zelcer N. Wiltshire H.R. Beijnen J.H. Schinkel A.H. Aids. 2002; 16: 2295-2301Google Scholar), and sulfinpyrazone and indomethacin stimulate transport of GSH (26Evers R. de Haas M. Sparidans R. Beijnen J. Wielinga P.R. Lankelma J. Borst P. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 375-383Google Scholar). The stimulation by the compounds studied was specific for MRP2. Neither lansoprazole nor saquinavir at their maximal MRP2-stimulatory concentration stimulated transport of E217βG in wild type, MRP1, MRP3, or MRP4 vesicles, and sulfanitran had no effect on transport of E217βG in wild type vesicles either (data not shown). Furosemide and acetaminophen-glucuronide even inhibited MRP3-mediated transport of E217βG (Fig. 4), whereas these compounds stimulated transport of E217βG by MRP2 (Fig. 2). Sulfanitran, the compound that stimulated MRP2 transport most, had only a minimal effect on MRP3 (Fig. 4). Effects of Drugs on Transport of GS-DNP by MRP2—GSH conjugates are another class of molecules transported by MRP2. We therefore tested whether transport of GS-DNP, a model GSH conjugate and a known substrate of MRP2, could be stimulated like transport of E217βG. The results are summarized in Table I. Like E217βG, GS-DNP transport is stimulated by sulfanitran and indomethacin albeit to a lower extent. Sulfinpyrazone stimulates GS-DNP transport in vesicular transport assays, similar to what we found previously in MDCKII/MRP2 cells (24Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Google Scholar). Furosemide at its maximal stimulatory concentration (500 μm) has only a marginal effect on GS-DNP transport, in contrast to its effect on E217βG transport. Moreover, whereas probenecid strongly stimulated the transport of E217βG, it inhibited GS-DNP transport as is the case for MTX as well.Table IEffects of drugs and organic anions on GS-DNP transport by MRP2CompoundConcentrationATP-dependent transportμM%Sulfanitran1,000253 ± 10Indomethacin100274 ± 11Furosemide500111 ± 3MTX2,20083 ± 1Probenecid1,00062 ± 3E217βG5100 ± 3Sulfinpyrazone1,000152 ± 2 Open table in a new tab Effects of Stimulators of MRP2-mediated E217βG Transport on the Affinity of MRP2 for Substrate—Evers et al. (26Evers R. de Haas M. Sparidans R. Beijnen J. Wielinga P.R. Lankelma J. Borst P. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 375-383Google Scholar) demonstrated that sulfinpyrazone stimulates transport of GSH by MRP2 and that vinblastine transport is accompanied by GSH transport at an approximate ratio of 1:1. Sulfinpyrazone also stimulates transport of E217βG by MRP2 (Fig. 2C). Compounds that stimulate E217βG transport by MRP2 might therefore be cotransported with this substrate, as proposed previously (26Evers R. de Haas M. Sparidans R. Beijnen J. Wielinga P.R. Lankelma J. Borst P. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 375-383Google Scholar). We have tested this in vesicular and transepithelial transport assays. We did not detect vesicular transport of [3H]penicillin G at concentrations of up to 1 mm either in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of E217βG (data not shown). Similarly, In vesicular transport assays we did not detect transport of [14C]indomethacin (at concentrations up to 50 μm) by MRP2. Negative results in vesicular transport assays are not conclusive, however, as the substrate may leak out of the vesicles at high rate, preventing transport measurements. This is not a problem in transepithelial transport assays with MDCKII/MRP2 cells. Indeed, in these assays we detected marginal transport of indomethacin and probenecid by MRP2 (data not shown). In the same assays, we did not detect transport of penicillin G or pantoprazole, another stimulator of E217βG transport by MRP2 (Fig. 2, and data not shown). These results indicate that these compounds are either not transported by MRP2 or are poor substrates, even though they strongly stimulate transport of E217βG by MRP2, making cotransport unlikely. To investigate the mechanism of stimulation further, we determined the rate of transport of E217βG by MRP2 as a function of substrate concentration in the absence or presence of 100 μm indomethacin or 1 mm sulfanitran (Fig. 5). The transport of E217βG by MRP2 was not consistent with simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but the plot of reaction velocity versus substrate concentration was clearly sigmoidal with an estimated apparent half-maximal rate (S1/2) at 120 μm E217βG (Fig. 5A). In the presence of either of the two stimulators, the curve was shifted to a more hyperbolic shape with apparent S1/2 values of 65 and 16 μm in the presence of 100 μm indomethacin and 1 mm sulfanitran, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C). The maximal rate of transport remained relatively unchanged. The degree of stimulation of E217βG transport at low substrate concentration (1 μm) by these compounds correlates well with the increased affinity for this substrate (Figs. 2 and 5). At 200 μm E217βG transport was not stimulated by 100 μm indomethacin and was only stimulated by 10% by 1 mm sulfanitran (data not shown) suggesting that at this concentration of substrate MRP2 is close to saturation. We note, however, that Bodo et al.2 found higher rates of E217βG transport at 1 mm than at 200 μm, the maximal concentration that we were able to test because of solubility problems. As a control, we also determined the concentration-dependent transport of E217βG by MRP1, for which we found saturation kinetics with a Km of 3.1 ± 0.3 μm and a Vmax of 38 ± 1 pmol/mg/min. This further strengthens the notion that the requirements for optimal transport of the same substrate by MRP1 and MRP2 are different (27Leslie E.M. Ito K. Upadhyaya P. Hecht S.S. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27846-27854Google Scholar), even though the substrate specificity of these transporters largely overlaps. Characterization of MTX Transport by MRP2—MTX is transported by MRP2, but MRP2 has such a low affinity for this substrate that we were unable to determine reliable kinetic parameters for this transport process (not shown and Refs. 25Bakos E. Evers R. Sinko E. Varadi A. Borst P. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Google Scholar and 33Chen Z.S. Lee K. Walther S. Raftogianis R.B. Kuwano M. Zeng H. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3144-3150Google Scholar). Sulfinpyrazone and indomethacin stimulate MTX transport, but to a much lower extent than the transport of E217βG (Fig. 6A). In contrast, E217βG, GSSG, and probenecid only inhibited MTX transport by MRP2 (Fig. 6B). E217βG at a concentration of 200 μm inhibits the transport of MTX by 80%, suggesting that these two substrates share a common step in transport. In this light, the absence of a substantial inhibitory or stimulatory effect of MTX (at a concentration up to 4.4 mm) on transport of 1 μm E217βG by MRP2 (Fig. 2F) is unexpected. A possible explanation is that MTX is a weak stimulator of E217βG transport and that at low E217βG concentrations (allosteric) stimulation and inhibition (by competition) of E217βG transport by MTX balance out. Indeed, MTX did inhibit the transport of high concentrations of E217βG (200 μm) and of 1 μm E217βG stimulated by 1 mm sulfanitran (Fig. 7). Moreover, trimetrexate, a structural analog of MTX, stimulates transport of 1 μm E217βG by 320 ± 10% at a concentration of 300 μm (data not shown). This is compatible with the hypothesis that MTX itself might have a weak stimulatory effect as well. Following the reasoning applied to MTX, GSH, another low affinity substrate of MRP2 (34Paulusma C.C. van Geer M.A. Evers R. Heijn M. Ottenhoff R. Borst P. Oude Elferink R.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 393-401Google Scholar), should be able to inhibit E217βG and MTX transport under appropriate conditions. However, GSH at concentrations up to 10 mm had no effect on the transport of 200 μm E217βG or 100 μm MTX by MRP2 (not shown).Fig. 7Transport of E217βG by MRP2 at saturating substrate concentrations is inhibited by MTX. Membrane vesicles containing MRP2 were incubated at 37 °C for 30 s with 200 μm [3H]E217βG (black bars) or with 1 μm [3H]E217βG together with 1 mm sulfanitran (hatched bars) in the presence of increasing concentrations of MTX. The ATP-dependent transport of E217βG by MRP2 was determined, and each bar represents the mean ± S.E. of experiments in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our work shows complex effects of various drugs and organic anions on MRP2. For transport of E217βG the plot of reaction velocity versus substrate concentration is sigmoidal (Fig. 5), indicative of at least two drug binding sites that interact in a positively cooperative manner. Many compounds stimulate E217βG transport at low substrate concentrations, and for two stimulators, sulfanitran and indomethacin, we have shown that they increase the affinity of MRP2 for substrate with no significant effect on the Vmax. Compounds that stimulate transport of substrates by MRP2 are not necessarily transported by MRP2. In vesicular transport assays we do not detect transport of [3H]penicillin G and [14C]indomethacin. Using vectorial transport assays with MDCKII/MRP2 cells we found only marginal transport of indomethacin and no transport of pantoprazole, another stimulator. Taurocholate is a good stimulator of E217βG transport by human (Fig. 2D) and rat Mrp2, but it is not transported by rat Mrp2 (35Akita H. Suzuki H. Ito K. Kinoshita S. Sato N. Takikawa H. Sugiyama Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1511: 7-16Google Scholar), as is the case with furosemide (36Chen C. Scott D. Hanson E. Franco J. Berryman E. Volberg M. Liu X. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2003; 20: 31-37Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that transport of a compound by MRP2 is not a prerequisite for its ability to stimulate the t"

Chem. 1997; 378: 827-836Google Scholar, 3Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Google Scholar). The oxidized cysteine residue is regenerated via intra- or intermolecular disulfide formation and electron transfer from donors such as thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, or glutathione (4Hofmann B. Hecht H.-J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Google Scholar, 5Dietz K.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 93-107Google Scholar). The regeneration mechanism is specific for each of the four types of peroxiredoxins, namely 1-Cys Prx, type II Prx, Prx Q, and 2-Cys Prx (5Dietz K.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 93-107Google Scholar). The various peroxiredoxins reveal distinct tissue distribution and transcriptional regulation, structural and biochemical properties suggesting specific biological tasks (5Dietz K.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 93-107Google Scholar, 6Horling F. Lamkemeyer P. König J. Finkemeier I. Kandlbinder A. Baier M. Dietz K.-J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 317-325Google Scholar, 7Park S.G. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar). Evidence exists that Prxs are involved in redox signaling and affect protein phosphorylation, transcriptional regulation, and apoptosis in animals (4Hofmann B. Hecht H.-J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Google Scholar). Crystal structure analysis groups Prxs into the thioredoxin superfamily (8Declercq J.P. Evrard C. Clippe A. Vander Stricht D. Bernard A. Knoops B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 751-759Google Scholar). Type II Prxs (PRDX5) act as monomers (8Declercq J.P. Evrard C. Clippe A. Vander Stricht D. Bernard A. Knoops B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 751-759Google Scholar). 1-Cys Prxs (HORF6) are monomeric too but form homodimers at protein concentrations of >1 mg/ml (9Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Google Scholar). 2-Cys Prxs have a second Cys at the C terminus (Cys185), which reacts with Cys64 of the other subunit to form a disulfide bridge. Crystal structures of reduced (TryP; Crithida fasciculata), oxidized (HBP23; rat), and overoxidized (TPxB; human) 2-Cys Prx homologues showed that reduction of the disulfide bridge induces a conformational change in the quaternary structure from a dimeric to a decameric doughnut-shaped form (10Alphey M.S. Bond C.S. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 903-916Google Scholar, 11Schröder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N. Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Struct. Fold.

Although oligomerization seems to be a general property of 2-Cys Prx, the in vivo parameters inducing oligomerization and its function are unknown. Low or high ionic strength, acidic pH, and reducing conditions are reported to promote oligomerization but differ in their effects upon various 2-Cys Prx (13Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5493-5504Google Scholar). In plants, the 2-Cys Prx is a nuclear encoded chloroplast protein. Analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis plants with decreased 2-Cys Prx levels showed impaired photosynthesis and increased oxidative damage of chloroplast proteins during early plant development (14Baier M. Dietz K.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1407-1414Google Scholar, 15Baier M. Noctor G. Foyer C.H. Dietz K.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 823-832Google Scholar). Regeneration of oxidized plant 2-Cys Prx is coupled to the photosynthetic electron transport chain via the electron donors Trx m and Trx f (16König J. Baier M. Horling F. Kahmann U. Harris G. Schürmann P. Dietz K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5738-5743Google Scholar, 17Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Google Scholar). In addition to thioredoxin, reduction by a chloroplastic drought-induced 32-kDa stress protein has been reported (18Broin M. Cuine S. Eymery F. Rey P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1417-1432Google Scholar). The redox potential of –315 mV (16König J. Baier M. Horling F. Kahmann U. Harris G. Schürmann P. Dietz K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5738-5743Google Scholar) places reductive regeneration of 2-Cys Prx between Calvin cycle activation and redox switching of the malate valve (16König J. Baier M. Horling F. Kahmann U. Harris G. Schürmann P. Dietz K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5738-5743Google Scholar). Apparently, in chloroplasts, the 2-Cys Prx detoxifies peroxides depending on the redox state of photosynthesis. Adaptation to the changing redox environment of chloroplasts might have imposed specific features on plant 2-Cys Prx such as catalytic activity, subcellular localization, and interacting partners. The present study on plant 2-Cys Prx function in the context of photosynthesis focuses on three major aspects: 1) the substrate specificity, 2) the reaction mechanism, and 3) the role of inactivation. To address these questions, a set of amino acid substitution mutants was designed and analyzed biochemically and physico-chemically. It will be shown that 2-Cys Prx reduces a wide range of peroxides including complex lipid hydroperoxides, which also inactivate the enzyme in a substrate- and concentration-dependent manner. An in vivo relevance of the oxidative inactivation is shown for stress conditions. Based on the observation that oxidatively inhibited 2-Cys Prx changed its quaternary structure and attached to the thylakoid membrane, it is hypothesized that 2-Cys Prx, besides its antioxidant function, might be a structural redox sensor of chloroplasts. Plant Growth—Barley (Hordeum vulgare var. Gerbel) was grown in soil under controlled environmental conditions with a 14-h light period at a photosynthetic active radiation of 100 μmol quanta m–2 s–1 and 25 °C and 10 h of darkness at 20 °C. For stress treatments, 12-day-old barley seedlings were grown for 48 h under the following conditions: 1) salt stress by irrigation with 500 mm NaCl; 2) cold stress at 4 °C; 3) wilting stress without watering; or 4) control condition as described above. Site-directed Mutagenesis of 2-Cys Prx—The pQE-30 vector-based expression system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to express PrxWT and the variants heterologously as His-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli M15[pREP4]. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with mutant primers in two subsequent polymerase chain reactions with Pfu polymerase (Table I) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to Montemartini et al. (19Montemartini M. Kalisz H.M. Hecht H.J. Steinert P. Flohe L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 516-524Google Scholar) using the PrxWT expression vector described previously (16König J. Baier M. Horling F. Kahmann U. Harris G. Schürmann P. Dietz K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5738-5743Google Scholar) as template.

Expression of recombinant protein was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After 4 h, the cell pellet obtained by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 min was stored overnight at –20 °C. For protein purification, the cells were resuspended in 5% (with respect to culture volume) of lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm ascorbate, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, pH 8.0 (NaOH), and shaken at 4 °C for 60 min. The cell debris was removed by spinning at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (2 ml/1 liter of culture), previously equilibrated with 20 column volumes of buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0 (NaOH)), followed by 20 volumes of buffer A supplemented with 20% glycerol. The protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. The protein-containing fractions, as assessed by measuring A280, were pooled and dialyzed three times against a 25-fold volume of 40 mm K-Pi (pH 7.0) for 4 h. The enzyme concentrations were determined from the molar absorption coefficient calculated with a software tool available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html and with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a reference. The protein was stored at –80 °C. E. coli thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase were overexpressed and purified as described by Yamamoto et al. (20Yamamoto H. Miyake C. Dietz K.J. Tomizawa K.I. Murata N. Yokota A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 269-273Google Scholar). Gel Permeation Chromatography—Protein size determination was performed with 50 μg of protein in a 100-μl solution using a Superose-6 column (length 30 cm, volume 20 ml; Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated and run in 40 mm K-Pi buffer (pH 7.0; 0.2 ml/min). The elution profile was monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm. Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences) were used as standards. Trx-dependent Activity Assay—Rates of H2O2 reduction were determined in a coupled assay with E. coli Trx and thioredoxin reductase by monitoring the decrease in A340 due to NADPH oxidation at 20 °C. The assay typically contained 50 μm hydroperoxide in 40 mm K-Pi buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm NADPH, 3 μm 2-Cys Prx, 9 μmE. coli Trx, 8 μmE. coli thioredoxin reductase in a volume of 1 ml. The initial rate of NADPH oxidation was calculated from the slope between 12 and 42 s after the addition of the peroxide substrate and corrected for the background oxidation of NADPH observed in the coupled assay without Prx. Ferrithiocyanate Assay—Enzyme (3 μm) was incubated with 10 mm DTT in 40 mm K-Pi buffer for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was started with 50 μm H2O2. Between 0 and 600 s, 50-μl aliquots were taken and transferred into 800 μl of trichloroacetic acid (12.5%) to stop the reaction. 200 μl of Fe(II)(NH4)2(SO4)2 (10 mm) and 100 μl of KSCN (2.5 m) were added to visualize the remaining H2O2 as a red-colored complex, which was quantified at 480 nm. Preparation of Phosphatidylcholine Dilinoleoyl Hydroperoxide and Linoleic Acid Hydroperoxide—Synthesis was performed according to Maiorino et al. (21Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Google Scholar). 10 μl of a chloroform solution (300 mm) of phosphatidylcholine dilinoleoyl or linoleic acid (Sigma) were evaporated, dissolved in 2.7 ml of 10 mm deoxycholate, and diluted with 0.1 m Na3BO3, pH 9, to a final volume of 9 ml. 3 × 50,000 units of soybean lipoxidase (Sigma) were added subsequently. The suspension was stirred vigorously for 5 min after both the first and the second addition and for 10 min after the third addition. The mixture was applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) that had been washed consecutively with 10 ml each of water, methanol, and water. After loading the sample, the column was washed with 50–100 ml of water. The peroxide was eluted with 3–4 ml of methanol. After evaporation of the solvent, the peroxide was dissolved in 1 ml of methanol. The peroxide concentration was determined spectroscopically (ϵ234 = 25 mm–1 cm–1). Preparation and Incubation of Intact Barley Chloroplasts—Chloroplasts were isolated and purified as described previously (16König J. Baier M. Horling F. Kahmann U. Harris G. Schürmann P. Dietz K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5738-5743Google Scholar) and incubated in a buffer containing 330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2 with or without 10 mm ascorbic acid for 5 min. 1 h after the addition of 0.1–10 mm H2O2, the chloroplasts were sedimented at 3000 × g. After removal of the supernatant, they were resuspended, lysed by the addition of 5 mm K-Pi buffer (pH 7.5), and spun at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was taken as stroma fraction, and the sedimented thylakoids were washed twice with K-Pi buffer (pH 7.5) prior to resuspension in the same buffer. Volumes equivalent to 10 μg of stroma and thylakoid proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using the Lumilight detection system (Roche Applied Science) and the BAS1 antibody specific to barley 2-Cys Prx (22Baier M. Dietz K.J. Plant J. 1997; 12: 179-189Google Scholar). Detection of Inactivated 2-Cys Prx in Vivo—Leaf tissue was ground with sand in a buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl. 8 μg of total protein from controls and stressed plant material were loaded per lane under nonreducing conditions. Sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, and 2-Cys Prx was detected by Western blot analysis. Time- and Wavelength-resolved Measurements—Time- and wavelength-resolved measurements were performed using a short pulse laser system in conjunction with an intensified streak camera. The laser system (Spectra Physics) consisted of a Ti:sapphire laser (Tsunami) with additional regenerative and two linear amplification stages. After frequency doubling and mixing of the second harmonic with the fundamental wavelength, UV radiation tunable between 250 and 300 nm was obtained. The settings were as follows: wavelength, 280 nm; pulse length, 80 ps; bandwidth, ∼0.7 cm–1; pulse energy, ∼50 μJ. Signals were collected with a spherical mirror, dispersed by an astigmatism-corrected spectrometer, and detected by a streak camera (Hamamatsu C2830). A more detailed description of the optical setup and the necessary calibration and evaluation procedures was given previously (23Plessow R. Brockhinke A. Eimer W. Kohse-Höinghaus K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 3695-3704Google Scholar). 2A. Brockhinke, R. Plessow, K. Kohse-Höinghaus, and C. Herrmann, submitted for publication. Excitation-Emission Spectra—Excitation-emission spectra were obtained using a custom-built setup employing a 75-watt xenon lamp as light source, two astigmatism-corrected spectrometers for signal processing, and a back-thinned CCD camera (Roper Scientific) for detection (25Brockhinke A. Plessow R. Dittrich P. Kohse-Höinghaus K. Appl. Phys. B. 2000; 71: 755-763Google Scholar). Sample Preparation for Laser and Excitation-Emission Spectroscopy—For time- and wavelength-resolved and for excitation-emission spectroscopy, 300 μl of a 20 μm (PrxWT), 9.1 μm (W99L), and 12.7 μm (W189L) protein solution was prepared in a 40 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Under reducing conditions, the buffer contained 10 mm DTT. For all measurements, samples were contained in quartz cuvettes of 5 × 5 mm (Hellma type 111.057-QS, suprasil, optical precision). Plant 2-Cys Prx Reduces Complex Lipid Hydroperoxides— Substrate specificity of plant 2-Cys Prx has not been studied in detail up to now. Therefore, an activity assay was performed in vitro using the electron transport chain E. coli Trx, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH (Fig. 1A). The oxidation of NADPH was monitored at 340 nm. From the initial velocity, the catalytic activity constants were calculated following subtraction of the background NADPH oxidation in the absence of the complete electron transfer chain (16König J. Baier M. Horling F. Kahmann U. Harris G. Schürmann P. Dietz K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5738-5743Google Scholar). The highest activity of 15.7 ± 0.8 min–1 was measured with t-BOOH as substrate, followed by 13.6 ± 1.2 min–1 with H2O2. The reduction of cumene hydroperoxide with 10.7 ± 0.84 min–1 was already less. The complex lipid substrates linoleic acid hydroperoxide (3.0 ± 0.1 min–1) and phosphatidylcholine dilinoleoyl hydroperoxide (0.88 ± 0.14 min–1) were reduced with considerably lower rates (Fig. 1B). Sequence Alignment Characterizes 2-Cys Prx as a Hydrophobic Protein with a Positively Charged C-terminal Tail—In order to identify interesting targets for site-directed mutagenesis of 2-Cys Prx, amino acid sequences of 2-Cys Prx from plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria were compared. Common to all 2-Cys Prx is the highly conserved active site around Cys64, the F-motif (FTFVCPTEI), and the hydrophobic region around Cys185 (VCPXXW) (4Hofmann B. Hecht H.-J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Google Scholar, 26Baier M. Dietz K.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 553-564Google Scholar). In the comparison, the conservation of several hydrophobic amino acids attracted special attention; the phenylalanine residues Phe37, Phe54, Phe55, Phe60, Phe62, Phe71, Phe78, and Phe143 in the active site region, two tryptophan residues (Trp99 and Trp189), and other hydrophobic amino acids are found in all 2-Cys Prx (Fig. 2). The number of conserved charged residues is low in comparison. The two polar residues Thr61 and Thr66 in the active site and three positively charged residues (Arg140, Arg163, and Arg170) are conserved, indicating involvement in the catalytic turnover of hydroperoxides. Compared with 2-Cys Prxs from other organisms, the C-terminal tail (aa 186–210, length of 25 aa) of the higher plant homologues contains four instead of two Pro residues and is shorter. In nuclear encoded 2-Cys Prx from higher plants and in the plastome-encoded homologue of the red algae Porphyra purpurea, the amino acid residues AAI follow the last conserved motif (FKEY), whereas in animal 2-Cys Prx the C terminus is more polar (e.g. ending with QKVNQ in AOP1 (27Tsuji K. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Obinata M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 377-381Google Scholar) or SKHN in TPx (28Lim Y-S. Cha M-K. Yun C-H. Kim H-K. Kim K. Kim I-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 199-206Google Scholar)). Between Cys185 and the FKEY motif most charged residues, three aspartate or glutamate and five lysine residues are conserved, still giving the plant C-terminal tail a polar and positively charged character similar to several nonplant 2-Cys Prx. The plant specific modification and the conserved positive charging raised the question of their specific function and were taken as the basis of the subsequent analysis by site-directed mutagenesis. Generation of PrxWTand Variants—Site-directed mutagenesis of the 2-Cys Prx was performed to address the reaction mechanism. For substitutions, amino acid residues with similar size or charge, respectively, were chosen to keep the effects on the structural stability minimal. All proteins were overexpressed in E. coli. The N-terminally His-tagged PrxWT and variants were isolated and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns under native conditions with yields of 5–25 mg/1 liter of LB culture. The addition of 10 mm ascorbate to the lysis buffer reduced inactivation and proteolysis during purification. On SDS-PAGE gels, the C64S and C185S variants dissociated into monomers under denaturing nonreducing conditions, whereas the other mutants were homodimers like PrxWT (data not shown). Peroxidase Activity of the Variants—The peroxidase activity of PrxWT and variants was determined using two different substrates, the small polar H2O2 and the alkyl hydroperoxide t-BOOH, in both the Trx-dependent assay (16König J. Baier M. Horling F. Kahmann U. Harris G. Schürmann P. Dietz K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5738-5743Google Scholar) and the assay with DTT (29Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Google Scholar). The remaining peroxide was subsequently determined with ferrithiocyanate (30Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 420-430Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). In the DTT assay, PrxWT only showed half the activity observed in the Trx assay, suggesting that Trx reduces the 2-Cys Prx more efficiently than DTT. As reported before, C64S had no activity (16König J. Baier M. Horling F. Kahmann U. Harris G. Schürmann P. Dietz K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5738-5743Google Scholar, 19Montemartini M. Kalisz H.M. Hecht H.J. Steinert P. Flohe L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 516-524Google Scholar, 31Flohe L. Budde H. Bruns K. Castro H. Clos J. Hofmann B. Kansal-Kalavar S. Krumme D. Menge U. Plank-Schumacher K. Sztajer H. Wissing J. Wylegalla C. Hecht H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 324-335Google Scholar). The variant C185S exhibited little activity in the Trx-based assay, but its reducing activity was 19-fold higher than measured for the PrxWT in the DTT assay. Apparently, Cys185 is not essential for peroxidase activity but for reductive regeneration of 2-Cys Prx by Trx. Exchange of the generally conserved Trp99 by the hydrophobic, nonaromatic Leu residue suppressed activity in all assays, implicating an important structural function. The C-terminally located Trp189 is specific for 2-Cys Prx. Trp189 and the active site Thr66 were replaced by Leu and the small hydrophobic Ala; the variants showed 47% (W189L) and 60% (T66A) residual activity in the Trx-based assay with H2O2, respectively. However, the activity was <50% of that with t-BOOH. In the DTT assay, the activities were not significantly different from those in the Trx assay with H2O2 for the T66A variant but increased in the DTT-based assay by 64% for the W189L variant as compared with Trx-dependent regeneration. Arg140 is conserved among all Prx, whereas Arg163 and Arg170 are specific for 2-Cys Prx. The hydrophilic, but neutral, Gln residue was chosen to substitute for Arg. In the Trx-dependent assay, R163Q and R170Q variants showed only slightly lower activities than the PrxWT, whereas the R140Q variant was inhibited by about 50% in the Trx assay. Interestingly, all Arg variants, especially Arg140 and Arg163, revealed strongly reduced activities in the DTT-dependent assay compared with the Trx assay. It can be concluded that these residues are important for peroxidase activity and not for regeneration. Thioredoxin Mediates the Reduction of the 2-Cys Prx—2-Cys PrxWT and the variants W189L and T66A were incubated with a limiting amount of DTT (0.2 mm instead of 10 mm as used above) or with Trx and DTT (Fig. 4). After 5 min, the redox state was fixed with N-ethylmaleimide. The reduced Prx fraction dissociated under denaturing conditions to the monomer, which can be distinguished from the dimer by SDS-PAGE. Only a small portion of 2-Cys PrxWT was reduced by DTT alone, whereas the addition of Trx promoted the reduction in all Prx variants. The reduced fractions of W189L and T66A in the presence of DTT were slightly greater than PrxWT but smaller with additional Trx. It is concluded that the variants are more easily reduced by DTT, but regeneration with Trx is inhibited compared with PrxWT. Quaternary Structure of 2-Cys Prx—The dimer is the minimal catalytic unit. Depending on ionic strength and redox state, Prx dimers arrange in oligomers and finally in decameric doughnut-shaped complexes. The influence of amino acid substitutions on quaternary structure was explored by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column (Fig. 5). The elution profile showed that the oxidized PrxWT almost exclusively existed as homodimer, whereas the two Cys variants aggregated to higher molecular mass complexes like the overoxidized PrxWT (not shown). Another peculiar change of quaternary structure was observed for the W189L variant, which to a minor extent eluted as dimer like PrxWT but predominantly existed as decamer as shown by peak elution in fractions 10 and 11 (Fig. 5). High Phosphate Concentrations Decrease Prx Activity in the Trx-dependent Assay—Barley 2-Cys Prx aggregates at high phosphate concentrations (16König J. Baier M. Horling F. Kahmann U. Harris G.

On the other hand, an interaction model of TryP and the reductant tryparedoxin in Trypanosoma indicates that the interaction is mediated by electrostatic forces involving Arg92, Lys93, Lys94, and Glu171 and probably the C-terminal tail (31Flohe L.

https://openalex.org/W2056423987,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a protein-tyrosine kinase that associates with multiple cell surface receptors and signaling proteins through which it can modulate the activity of several intracellular signaling pathways. FAK activity can influence the formation of distinct actin cytoskeletal structures such as lamellipodia and stress fibers in part through effects on small Rho GTPases, although the molecular interconnections of these events are not well defined. Here, we report that FAK interacts with p190RhoGEF, a RhoA-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor, in neuronal cells and in brain tissue extracts by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization analyses. Using a two-hybrid assay and deletion mutagenesis, the binding site of the FAK C-terminal focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain was identified within the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of p190RhoGEF. Binding was independent of a LD-like binding motif within p190RhoGEF, yet FAK association was disrupted by a mutation (Leu-1034 to Ser) that weakens the helical bundle structure of the FAK FAT domain. Neuro-2a cell binding to laminin increased endogenous FAK and p190RhoGEF tyrosine phosphorylation, and co-transfection of a dominant-negative inhibitor of FAK activity, termed FRNK, inhibited lamininstimulated p190RhoGEF tyrosine phosphorylation and p21 RhoA GTP binding. Overexpression of FAK in Neuro-2a cells increased both endogenous p190RhoGEF tyrosine phosphorylation and RhoA activity, whereas these events were inhibited by FRNK co-expression. Because insulin-like growth factor 1 treatment of Neuro-2a cells increased FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced p190RhoGEF-mediated activation of RhoA, our results support the conclusion that FAK association with p190RhoGEF functions as a signaling pathway downstream of integrins and growth factor receptors to stimulate Rho activity.

Rho GTPases are members of the Ras GTPase superfamily that play an important role in a wide range of biological processes, including actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cell motility, gene expression, and cell cycle progression (as reviewed in Refs. 1Schmitz A.A. Govek E.E. Bottner B. Van Aelst L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Google Scholar and 2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Google Scholar). Rho GTPases act as molecular switches existing in either an inactive GDP-bound or an active GTP-bound form. Three classes of regulatory proteins interact with Rho GTPases to facilitate an active or inactive conformation: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; IP, immunoprecipitation; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FAT, focal adhesion targeting; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FRNK, FAK-related nonkinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IF, immunofluorescence; pTyr, phosphotyrosine; PTK, protein tyrosine kinase; RBD, Rho binding domain; SH3, Src homology 3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; IP, immunoprecipitation; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FAT, focal adhesion targeting; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FRNK, FAK-related nonkinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IF, immunofluorescence; pTyr, phosphotyrosine; PTK, protein tyrosine kinase; RBD, Rho binding domain; SH3, Src homology 3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. stimulate the GDP-GTP exchange reaction; GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) promote hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, whereas guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) antagonize the actions of both GEFs and GAPs. Although activation of Rho GTPases can occur by inhibiting GAPs or GDIs, a number of studies suggest that GEFs are the primary mediators of Rho GTPases activation (as reviewed in Ref. 3Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Google Scholar).GEFs share the presence of a Dbl homology domain involved in GDP-GTP exchange and an adjacent pleckstrin homology domain. Except for this common Dbl-pleckstrin domain structure, GEFs contain a variety of additional protein motifs that are implicated in mediating signal transduction connections. GEF activation can occur through the release of intermolecular contacts (4Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Google Scholar), through direct protein-protein interactions (5Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Google Scholar, 6Wells C.D. Liu M.Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.M. Rothstein J.D. Kozasa T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1174-1181Google Scholar), and, for Vav RhoGEFs, as a result of tyrosine phosphorylation (7Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6372-6381Google Scholar). Notably, recent studies have identified that other RhoGEF family proteins can be activated by protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) such as c-Src (8Kiyono M. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Google Scholar), Ack (9Kato J. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 141-147Google Scholar), Tec (10Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Mano H. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 733-738Google Scholar), or FAK (11Chikumi H. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12463-12473Google Scholar).FAK associates with both integrins and growth factor receptors to modulate signaling affecting cell motility, cell survival, and cell cycle progression (for reviews see Refs. 12Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Google Scholar and 13Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Google Scholar). Increased FAK tyrosine phosphorylation after G-protein-linked receptor activation has been correlated with the formation of actin stress fibers (12Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Google Scholar). Actin stress fiber formation is an indirect indicator of increased Rho activity in many cell types (2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Google Scholar). Recently, FAK activity has been implicated in promoting the sustained activity of Rho after thrombin stimulation of cells by promoting the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PDZ-Rho-GEF and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (11Chikumi H. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12463-12473Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether these phosphorylation events were mediated by direct or indirect interactions with FAK. Another recent study has shown that the Trio GEF can bind to the N-terminal domain of FAK through a Trio Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain binding interaction (14Medley Q.G. Buchbinder E.A. Tachibana K. Ngo H. Serra-Pages C. Streuli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13265-13270Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of Trio was shown to enhance FAK-associated kinase activity and FAK promoted phosphorylation at Tyr-2737 within the Trio C-terminal kinase domain (14Medley Q.G. Buchbinder E.A. Tachibana K. Ngo H. Serra-Pages C. Streuli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13265-13270Google Scholar). Because these studies were performed by co-transfection and overexpression analyses, it remains to be determined whether Trio is an endogenous component of a FAK signaling complex.In this study, we have identified FAK as an endogenous and direct binding partner for p190RhoGEF, a ubiquitously expressed RhoA-specific GEF (15Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Google Scholar, 16van Horck F.P. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Google Scholar). In addition to the tandem Dbl-pleckstrin homology domain, p190RhoGEF contains several potential regulatory motifs, including an N-terminal leucine-rich region, a cysteine-rich zinc finger domain, and a large C-terminal domain with a potential coiled-coil region that has been shown to bind microtubules (16van Horck F.P. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Google Scholar), a destabilizing element in the 3′-untranslated region of neurofilament mRNA (17Canete-Soler R. Wu J. Zhai J. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32046-32050Google Scholar), and to either 14-3-3 proteins (18Zhai J. Lin H. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. Canete-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41318-41324Google Scholar) or the phosphotyrosine binding domain of JIP-1 (19Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35113-35118Google Scholar) in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Despite the identification of these binding partners, the in vivo regulation of p190RhoGEF GDP-GTP exchange activity remains unknown. Here, we show that FAK overexpression or laminin stimulation of Neuro-2a cells promotes p190RhoGEF tyrosine phosphorylation. FAK overexpression with p190RhoGEF is associated with the enhanced activation of p21 RhoA by p190RhoGEF and inhibiting FAK activity via expression of the FAK C-terminal domain termed FRNK blocks this signaling event. These studies support a direct role for p190RhoGEF in linking FAK to Rho activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs and Reagents—Expression vectors for p190RhoGEF (full-length and C-terminal domain) were described previously (18Zhai J. Lin H. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. Canete-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41318-41324Google Scholar). Murine FAK and FRNK expression vectors were used as described previously (20Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Google Scholar). Coding sequences for RhoA and the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of Rhotekin (amino acids 7–89) (21Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Google Scholar) were amplified from a mouse spinal cord cDNA library (Stratagene) and cloned into pHM6 (Roche Applied Science) and pGEX-6p-1 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Monoclonal antibodies (clone 12CA5) to hemagglutinin (HA) and c-Myc (clone 9E10) were from Roche and monoclonal antibodies to FAK (clone 77) and phosphotyrosine (pTyr, clone RC20) were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Living Colors A.v. peptide antibody to GFP was from BD Biosciences. Anti-RhoA and protein A/G PLUS-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Lumi-Light PLUS Western blotting substrate and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) were from Roche Applied Science.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—As described previously (18Zhai J. Lin H. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. Canete-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41318-41324Google Scholar), the YRG-2 yeast strain containing GAL4 BD-p190RhoGEF-C was transformed with the mouse embryonic day 12.5 spinal cord cDNA library constructed in pAD-GAL4–2.1 (Stratagene). Colony growth was selected on media lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, and clones were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmid DNA from positive clones was recovered and sequenced.Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a) from ATCC (CCL-131) and DRG cells derived from rat sensory neurons 2R. Canete-Soler, unpublished data. were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were transfected using the FuGene6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions.Anti-p190RhoGEF Polyclonal Antibody—PCR was used to amplify the coding sequence of amino acids 1457–1582 of p190RhoGEF, cloned into pGEX-6p-1, and 500 μg of the purified GST fusion protein was injected into rabbits as an antigen. Total serum IgG was isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and p190RhoGEF-specific antibodies were affinity-purified using GST-p190RhoGEF-(1457–1582) covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-GST antibodies were removed by passing the affinity-purified IgG over a GST column (Pierce), and the specificity of the anti-p190RhoGEF antibody was confirmed by Western blot analysis combined with soluble GST-p190RhoGEF fusion protein neutralization.Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Cells were lysed with cold detergent-containing buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm PMSF), and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Brains from E13, E19, and adult mice were snap frozen, minced, resuspended in cell lysis buffer, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates and brain extracts were normalized for the protein content (Pierce) and incubated with antibodies to HA, c-Myc, FAK, or p190RhoGEF, respectively. Immunocomplexes were then precipitated with protein A/G PLUS-agarose, washed twice in lysis buffer, eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis.Cell Stimulation with Laminin—Neuro-2a cells were grown to 90% confluence, detached with limited trypsin treatment, and suspended in growth medium for 30 min, then the cells were either lysed or allowed to adhere to laminin-coated plates (BD Biosciences) for 1 h. Cell lysates were divided into three parts: two of which were used to immunoprecipitate FAK and blotted for either p190RhoGEF association or for pTyr. p190RhoGEF was directly immunoprecipitated from the remaining third of the lysate and blotted for pTyr. The FAK or p190RhoGEF IPs were sequentially re-probed with antibodies to FAK or p190RhoGEF, respectively, as described previously (20Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Google Scholar). To perform analyses of laminin-stimulated Rho activity, cells were serum-starved (0.5% FBS) for 18 h and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin prior to replating.Rho Pull-down Assay—Neuro-2a cells were lysed in Rho-binding lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm PMSF). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and equal amount of lysates (500 μg of protein content) were incubated with 20 μg of immobilized GST-RBD at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed four times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm PMSF). The bound RhoA was eluted by boiling in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and subjected to RhoA immunoblot analysis. The relative level of GTP-bound RhoA was determined by densitometry scanning of immunoblots and normalized to the amount of total RhoA expression in the lysates as determined by blotting of whole cell lysates. Data is presented as -fold activation compared with the levels of GTP-bound RhoA in cells transfected with p190RhoGEF. Significance between data sets was determined by one-way analysis of variance.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Neuro-2a cells plated on round coverslips were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h on ice and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were incubated with either affinity-purified rabbit anti-p190RhoGEF (1:1000) or mouse monoclonal anti-FAK (1:2000) for 72 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor® 594 chicken anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 24 h at 4 °C. After mounting, cells were examined by laser-scanning confocal microscopy.RESULTSIdentification of FAK as a Binding Partner for p190RhoGEF— To explore the interactive properties of p190RhoGEF, residues 1276–1582 in the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF (p190RhoGEF-C) were used as bait in a two-hybrid screen of a mouse embryonic spinal cord cDNA library. Two clones were identified with open reading frame sequences matching the C-terminal 140 residues of FAK. To verify the specificity of this interaction, yeast were co-transformed with the respective cDNAs and tested for their abilities to grow on selective media and to activate a β-galactosidase (LacZ) reporter through binding to a bipartite GAL4 transcription factor. As shown in Table I, only co-transformants containing both p190RhoGEF-C and the C-terminal sequence of FAK (FAK-C) grew on selective media and activated LacZ. Although previous studies using a LexA-FAK C-terminal domain construct promoted “prey”-independent promoter activation (22Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Google Scholar), no growth was observed in cells transfected with pAD-FAK-C alone (data not shown).Table ISpecificity of p190RhoGEF and FAK interactionsYeast transformationSD plates/-Leu-Trp-HisLacZ expressionpBD/p190RhoGEF-C and pAD vectorNo growthWhitepBD/p190RhoGEF-C and pAD/lamin CNo growthWhitepBD/p190RhoGEF-C and pAD/FAK-CGrowthBlue Open table in a new tab Interactions of p190RhoGEF and FAK in Vivo—To determine whether p190RhoGEF interacts with FAK in mammalian cells, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed with Neuro-2a cells co-transfected with HA-tagged p190RhoGEF or HA-tagged p190RhoGEF-C along with either EGFP-tagged FAK or EGFP-tagged FRNK (13Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Google Scholar) that encompasses the entire C-terminal domain of FAK. Whereas in the absence of exogenous HA-p190RhoGEF expression there was no association of FAK with anti-HA antibodies (data not shown), both FAK and FRNK co-immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies in cells co-transfected with full-length or p190RhoGEF-C (Fig. 1).To explore the interaction between endogenous p190RhoGEF and FAK, polyclonal antibodies were generated to p190RhoGEF residues 1457–1582. When whole cell lysates of Neuro-2a cells transfected with HA-tagged p190RhoGEF-C or full-length p190RhoGEF (Fig. 2A) were blotted with affinity-purified antibodies to anti-p190RhoGEF (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2) or with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), strong immunoreactive p190RhoGEF-C and p190RhoGEF bands were detected. Notably, the anti-p190RhoGEF antibody also recognized a similar sized band as full-length HA-p190RhoGEF in lysates of p190RhoGEF-C-transfected cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1). This band most likely represents endogenous p190RhoGEF in Neuro-2a cells.Fig. 2Endogenous expression of p190RhoGEF and interaction with FAK in neuronal cells and in brain extracts.A, Neuro-2a cells were transfected with the indicated HA-tagged p190RhoGEF constructs and whole cell lysates were analyzed by either polyclonal p190RhoGEF (lanes 1 and 2) or HA-tag (lanes 3 and 4) blotting. Lane 1, ∼190-kDa immunoreactivity with polyclonal p190RhoGEF antibodies represents endogenous protein expression.

C, anti-FAK co-IP assay using lysates from Neuro-2a cells, from embryonic day 13 (E13), E19, and adult mouse brain tissue extracts. Endogenous p190RhoGEF association (upper panel) is shown with the amount of FAK present in the IPs analyzed by membrane reprobing (lower panel). D, anti-p190RhoGEF co-IP assay using lysates from Neuro-2a cells and from adult mouse brain tissue shows endogenous FAK association (upper panel) with the amount of p190RhoGEF present in the IPs (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Polyclonal antibodies to p190RhoGEF and to FAK were then used to determine whether endogenous FAK and p190RhoGEF were associated in lysates of neuronal cells (Fig. 2B) and in brain extracts (Fig. 2, C and D). By co-IP, p190RhoGEF was associated with FAK in lysates from Neuro-2a cells and DRG sensory neurons (Fig. 2B). Maximal p190RhoGEF association with FAK was detected in lysates from E19 mouse brain extracts (Fig. 2C) compared with the weaker binding of FAK and p190RhoGEF in lysates of adult brain (Fig. 2, C and D). One reason why p190RhoGEF and FAK binding is less in adult mouse brain is that p190RhoGEF may be subject to proteolytic degradation as a faster migrating band is present p190RhoGEF IPs from adult brain lysates (Fig. 2D). Nevertheless, these results confirm the co-expression of these proteins in neuronal cell lines and mouse brain and show the endogenous interaction of p190RhoGEF with FAK.Co-localization of p190RhoGEF and FAK—To determine the intracellular distribution of these proteins, Neuro-2a cells were stained with affinity-purified antibodies to p190RhoGEF (Fig. 3A), a monoclonal antibody to FAK (Fig. 3B), and confocal microscopy was used to detect the indirect immunofluorescence (IF) of secondary antibody distribution. p190RhoGEF IF was observed in the cytoplasm, associated with short and long neurites (Fig. 3A, arrows), as well as in distal growth cone projections (Fig. 3A, arrowhead and inset). Merging of the p190RhoGEF IF with the FAK IF revealed a similar but not identical co-distribution (Fig. 3C). Co-localization of p190RhoGEF and FAK was especially evident in the tips of neurites and in distal growth cones. Antibodies to both p190RhoGEF and to FAK also revealed a distinctly reticulated and non-overlapping staining pattern in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). Taken together with the co-IP results, these findings support the potential for signaling connections between FAK and p190RhoGEF in vivo.Fig. 3Co-localization of p190RhoGEF and FAK in Neuro-2a cells. Confocal microscopy was used to determine the indirect IF of antibodies bound to p190RhoGEF (A) and FAK (B) in Nuero-2a cells. C, merged images of A and B reveal regions of co-localization (yellow), and nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI. Images reveal overlapping but non-homogeneous distribution within the cytoplasm, short neural processes (arrows), and in distal growth cones (arrowheads and inset). p190RhoGEF IF was abolished by preincubation of anti-p190RhoGEF antibodies with GST-p190RhoGEF-C (data not shown). Scale bars, 50 and 10 μm (inset).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of FAK Binding Sites on p190RhoGEF—As identified in the two-hybrid screen, the C-terminal region of p190RhoGEF interacts with the C-terminal 140 amino acids of FAK. Previous studies have shown that the adaptor protein paxillin binds to this region of FAK through interactions mediated by an LD motif in paxillin that is formed by the consensus sequence, LDXLLXXL (23Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Turner C.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 114-118Google Scholar). Primary sequence analyses revealed that p190RhoGEF-C contains a potential LD-like motif between residues Leu-1376 and Leu-1383, LTRLLYSL. To determine the importance of this putative LD motif in p190RhoGEF for FAK binding, this region was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis in p190RhoGEF-C, and co-IP assays were performed with co-transfected FAK or FRNK in Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, p190RhoGEF-C lacking this potential LD motif still associated with both FAK and FRNK, indicating that this region of p190RhoGEF is not essential for FAK binding (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Residues 1292–1301 of p190RhoGEF and the structural integrity of the FAK FAT domain are required for p190RhoGEFFAK association.A, Neuro-2a cells were transfected with the indicated HA-tagged p190RhoGEF-C constructs along with either Myc-tagged FRNK or FAK constructs, and co-IP assays were performed using anti-Myc antibodies and blotted for p190RhoGEF association (upper panel) or FAK/FRNK expression (lower panel). The internal deletion of the LD-like motif within p190RhoGEF (Δ1376–1383) did not disrupt p190RhoGEF-C binding to FAK or FRNK.

Expression level of p190RhoGEF-C constructs in whole cell lysates is shown (lower panel). E, Neuro-2a cells were co-transfected with EGFP-tagged p190RhoGEF-C and HA-tagged FRNK or with HA-FRNK containing a Leu-1034 to Ser mutation within the FAT domain. Co-IP assays were performed using anti-HA antibodies and blotted for p190RhoGEF-C association (left panel) or HA-FRNK expression (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To identify the FAK binding region in p190RhoGEF-C, a series of truncations surrounding and within the coiled-coil domain (Fig. 4B) were created and tested for interaction with FRNK using a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4C). Loss of growth in selective media and β-galactosidase activity occurred when N-terminal deletions were extended from residues 1276–1353 within p190RhoGEF-C, whereas C-terminal truncations to residue 1472 did not disrupt the two-hybrid association (Fig. 4C). To verify the importance of this 1276–1353 region in mediating interactions with FAK in mammalian cells, HA-tagged N-terminal truncations or an internal deletion mutant of p190RhoGEF-C were tested for co-IP with Myc-tagged FAK upon co-transfection of Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 4D). Whereas deletion of residues 1276–1292 in p190RhoGEF-C did not affect FAK binding, truncation of p190RhoGEF-C from residues 1276 to 1301 resulted in the expression of a protein that did not associate with FAK (Fig. 4D). Notably, the internal deletion of residues 1292–1301 within p190RhoGEF-C also disrupted binding to FAK (Fig. 4D). These studies support the conclusion that residues 1292–1301 (DVSQSSEESP) are required for the binding of the p190RhopGEF-C to FAK.p190RhoGEF Binding to the FAK FAT Domain—Structural studies have shown that the C-terminal 140 residues of FAK that associate with p190RhoGEF comprise the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain of FAK and that this FAT region forms a four-helical bundle structure (24Hayashi I. Vuori K. Liddington R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 101-106Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that a point mutation at Leu-1034 to Ser disrupts paxillin binding to the FAK FAT domain but not the association of talin, which also binds to the FAK FAT domain region (25Klingbeil C.K. Hauck C.R. Hsia D.A. Jones K.C. Reider S.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 97-110Google Scholar). This Leu-1034 to Ser mutation alters a hydrophobic interaction within the interior of the four-helical bundle structure (24Hayashi I. Vuori K. Liddington R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 101-106Google Scholar). When the Ser-1034 mutation is introduced into FRNK, it results in the inactivation of FAT-mediated targeting of FRNK to focal contacts (20Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Google Scholar). To determine whether FAT domain function is required for binding to p190RhoGEF, Neuro-2a cells were co-transfected with GFP-p190RhoGEF-C and"
https://openalex.org/W2041376033,"Caspase-8 is a key effector of death-receptor-triggered apoptosis. In a previous study, we demonstrated, however, that caspase-8 can also be activated in a death receptor-independent manner via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, downstream of caspase-3. Here, we show that caspases-3 and -8 mediate a mitochondrial amplification loop that is required for the optimal release of cytochrome c, mitochondrial permeability shift transition, and cell death during apoptosis induced by treatment with the microtubule-damaging agent paclitaxel (Taxol). In contrast, Smac release from mitochondria followed a different pattern, and therefore seems to be regulated independently from cytochrome c release. Taxol-induced cell death was inhibited by the use of synthetic, cell-permeable caspase-3- (zDEVD-fmk) or caspase-8-specific (zIETD-fmk) inhibitors. Apoptosis signaling was not affected by a dominant-negative FADD mutant (FADD-DN), thereby excluding a role of death receptor signaling in the amplification loop and drug-induced apoptosis. The inhibitor experiments were corroborated by the use of BJAB cells overexpressing the natural serpin protease inhibitor, cytokine response modifier A. These data demonstrate that the complete activation of mitochondria, release of cytochrome c, and execution of drug-induced apoptosis require a mitochondrial amplification loop that depends on caspases-3 and -8 activation. In addition, this is the first report to demonstrate death receptor-independent caspase-8 autoprocessing in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1995771017,"p62 is a multifunctional cytoplasmic protein able to noncovalently bind ubiquitin and several signaling proteins, suggesting a regulatory role connected to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. No studies to date have linked p62 protein expression with pathological states. Here we demonstrate the overabundance of p62 protein in malignant breast tissue relative to normal breast tissue. The proteasome inhibitor PSI increased p62 mRNA and protein; however, PSI treatment of breast epithelial cells transfected with the p62 promoter did not affect promoter activity. High levels of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) mRNA have been identified in breast cancer compared to normal breast. Only the PSA and maspin promoters have been identified as targets of this transcription factor. Here we show that PDEF stimulates the p62 promoter through at least two sites, and likely acts as a coactivator. PSI treatment abrogates the PDEF-stimulated increase of p62 promoter activity by 50%. Thus, multiple mechanisms for the induction of p62 exist. We conclude that (1) p62 protein is overexpressed in breast cancer; (2) p62 mRNA and protein increase in response to PSI, with no change of basal promoter activity; (3) PDEF upregulates p62 promoter activity through at least two sites; and (4) PSI downregulates PDEF-induced p62 promoter activation through one of these sites."
https://openalex.org/W2051882112,"Protein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase involved in many biological processes. It is overexpressed in many malignancies including rodent and human breast cancer, and is up-regulated in Wnt-transfected mammary epithelial cells, where it can be found in a complex with dishevelled and β-catenin. β-Catenin is a substrate for CK2 and inhibition of CK2 reduces levels of β-catenin and dishevelled. Here we report that inhibition of CK2 using pharmacologic agents or expression of kinase inactive subunits reduces β-catenin-dependent transcription and protein levels in a proteasome-dependent fashion. The major region of phosphorylation of β-catenin by CK2 is the central armadillo repeat domain, where carrier proteins like axin and the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product APC interact with β-catenin. The major CK2 phosphorylation site in this domain is Thr393, a solvent-accessible residue in a key hinge region of the molecule. Mutation of this single amino acid reduces β-catenin phosphorylation, cotranscriptional activity, and stability. Thus, CK2 is a positive regulator of Wnt signaling through phosphorylation of β-catenin at Thr393, leading to proteasome resistance and increased protein and co-transcriptional activity.

Thus, CK2 is a positive regulator of Wnt signaling through phosphorylation of β-catenin at Thr393, leading to proteasome resistance and increased protein and co-transcriptional activity. Protein kinase CK2 is ubiquitously expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is highly conserved through evolution; mammalian CK2 can substitute for the yeast enzyme (1Dotan I. Ziv E. Dafni N. Beckman J.S. McCann R.O. Glover C.V. Canaani D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 603-609Google Scholar). CK2 functions as a tetramer assembled by homodimerization of two regulatory β subunits followed by recruitment of two catalytic subunits (α or α′) (2Battistutta R. Sarno S. De Moliner E. Marin O.

Sommercorn J. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7638-7644Google Scholar). Activity is regulated by the β subunit, which confers some of the substrate specificity (6Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1403-1406Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, deletion of either of the catalytic subunits results in a normal phenotype, but deletion of both leads to growth arrest (7Glover C.V. Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 481-488Google Scholar). In mammals, the α′ subunit is required for normal male germ cell development (8Xu X. Toselli P.A. Russell L.D. Seldin D.C. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 118-121Google Scholar).CK2 is not known to be regulated by second messengers, but its activity is enhanced by polyamines and polylysines (9Chaudhry P.S. Casillas E.R. Arch. Biochem.

Biochemically, CK2 is unusual in that it is one of the few kinases that can efficiently utilize either ATP or GTP as the phosphoryl donor (15Cochet C. Feige J.J. Pirollet F. Keramidas M. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 1357-1361Google Scholar), a property that is very useful experimentally to identify its activity.CK2 phosphorylates serine or threonine in acidic domains, with S/TXXD/E being the canonical motif (16Hrubey T.W.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 117-120Google Scholar). CK2 regulates many fundamental cellular processes. Of particular interest with respect to cancer biology, CK2 phosphorylates many transcription factors, proto-oncoproteins, and tumor suppressor proteins including c-Myc (20Bousset K. Oelgeschlager M.H. Henriksson M. Schreek S. Burkhardt H. Litchfield D.W. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Luscher B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 501-511Google Scholar), Max (21Bousset K. Henriksson M.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Google Scholar), and others.CK2 phosphorylation can regulate DNA binding, e.g. for c-Jun (24Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D.

However, one of the important functions of CK2 phosphorylation appears to be the regulation of protein stability. Access of critical cellular proto-oncoproteins to the proteasome is frequently regulated by phosphorylation. CK2 phosphorylates c-Myc in the C terminus (20Bousset K. Oelgeschlager M.H. Henriksson M. Schreek S. Burkhardt H. Litchfield D.W. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Luscher B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 501-511Google Scholar) and we have recently found that this stabilizes c-Myc protein levels in cells (26Channavajhala P. Seldin D.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5280-5288Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PTEN by CK2 stabilizes it, although this inhibits its lipid phosphatase activity and raises the level of phospho-AKT in cells (27Miller S. Lou D. Seldin D. Lane W. Neel B.

Each of these activities can contribute to cell proliferation and transformation.Studies in Drosophila have implicated CK2 in the Wnt pathway, an important pathway during embryonic development, as the signaling intermediate dishevelled (Dvl) 1The abbreviations used are: Dvl, dishevelled; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: Dvl, dishevelled; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase. was found to associate with and be a substrate for CK2 (35Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Google Scholar). In mouse mammary epithelial cells, we found that Wnt signaling increases CK2 levels and activity. β-Catenin complexes with CK2 and Dvl and is itself a substrate of CK2. CK2 inhibition in these cells reduces the steady-state levels of both β-catenin and Dvl (36Song D.H. Sussman D.J. Seldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23790-23797Google Scholar). In addition to its role in development, the Wnt pathway is increasingly recognized to play a role in human cancers, through mutation of genes encoding β-catenin itself or its regulators, chiefly APC, the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product, or axin. These two proteins act as a bridge between β-catenin and GSK3β, facilitating GSK3β phosphorylation of β-catenin at the N terminus on Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41. These phosphorylations require a prior “priming” phosphorylation at Ser45 by CK1α (37Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Google Scholar). N-terminal phosphorylation of β-catenin leads to its degradation by the proteasome. Wnt signaling can be regulated by other kinases and phosphatases including casein kinase-1ϵ (CK1ϵ) (38Lee E.

The major site of phosphorylation by CK2 is Thr393 of β-catenin, a residue in a solvent-exposed region as determined by analysis of the three-dimensional x-ray structure of the central domain of the protein. Ala substitution at position 393 produces a mutant β-catenin with reduced stability in Xenopus embryos and reduced co-transcriptional activity in mammalian cells, confirming the direct action of CK2 on phosphorylation and function of β-catenin.MATERIALS AND METHODSTissue Culture and Reporter Assays—COS7 and Wnt-1-C57MG (36Song D.H. Sussman D.J. Seldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23790-23797Google Scholar) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech Inc. Cellgro, Herndon, VA). For some experiments, COS7 cells were treated with pharmacologic agents to inhibit kinase activity. Apigenin (chrysin), a flavonoid that is a selective inhibitor of CK2, was used at 80 μm and wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, was used at 25 nm for 2 h. For other experiments, Wnt-1-C57MG cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 overnight to inhibit the 26 S proteasome complex, and then with apigenin for 2 h. For transient transfection, subconfluent COS7 cells were incubated with DNA (1 μg of DNA per plasmid) and FuGENE-6 liposome reagent (3 μl per 1 μg of DNA) (Roche Diagnostics) that were mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the reporter assay, 1 × 105 COS7 cells were plated into 6-well plates and on the following day, the transfection was performed. Equal amounts of plasmids encoding the luciferase reporter and β-galactosidase were used. Total DNA was balanced with the addition of empty vector. For some experiments, CK2 was inhibited for the last 2 h of the transfection by the addition of 80 μm apigenin. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for the ability to stimulate transcription of a LEF-1-dependent luciferase reporter and for cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase activity. Cells were harvested in 1× reporter lysis buffer by scraping. 10 μl of protein extract was assayed for luciferase activity by incubating with 50 μl of firefly luciferase substrate (Promega) and immediately reading on a luminometer (MGM Instruments) for 10 s. Samples were assayed in duplicate and the luciferase counts were normalized by dividing by the values from the β-galactosidase reporter assay. For the β-galactosidase reporter assay, 10 μl of protein extract was diluted with 40 μl of 1× lysis buffer in a 96-well plate. β-Galactosidase was used as a standard, diluted in varying amounts of 1× lysis buffer. 50 μl of 2× assay buffer (Promega) was added to each of the diluted samples. After mixing, the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min or until a faint yellow color developed. The reactions were stopped with 150 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate and absorbance of the samples was immediately read at 415 nm on a plate reader.Western Analysis—Equal amounts of protein as determined by BCA protein assay were diluted with 2× sample loading buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothretol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol), boiled, and loaded onto polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was performed in a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II gel system at 110 V for 90 min. After electrophoresis, gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell Inc.) using a semi-dry electroblotter (Owl Scientific, Woburn, MA) at 400 mA constant current for 1.5–2 h. After the transfer, membranes were blocked overnight with 5% dry milk in wash buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20) and probed for protein expression using antibodies against CK2α (Stressgen, British Columbia, Canada), β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), or GST (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Typically, primary antibody incubations were carried out at room temperature for 1 h. After primary antibody incubation, membranes were washed thoroughly and appropriate secondary antibodies were coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) were used to recognize the primary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence in Signaling Solution (Pierce). A monoclonal antibody against β-actin (Sigma) was used to confirm equal loading of the Western blot membranes for samples. When using the same membrane for sequential antibody detection, the membrane was briefly stripped at 65 °C for 5 min in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS), washed 2–3 times in wash buffer, and blocked again in 5% milk.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Extracts from COS7 cells (10 μg) were assayed for CK2 kinase activity in kinase buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 μm Na3VO4, and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Each sample was assayed with and without CK2-specific synthetic peptide, RRREEETEEE, to investigate the activity of the CK2 enzyme present in the lysates. Samples incubated without the substrate peptide were used as a background control and the resulting radioactive counts later subtracted from the radioactive counts of their peptide counterparts. Samples were assayed in duplicates. Upon labeling for 20 min at 37 °C with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP, radioactive counts were blotted onto P81 filter circles and washed 4 times in 150 mm H3PO4. P81 filter circles were then analyzed on an automatic β-counter.Free or bead-bound GST-β-catenin was incubated with recombinant CK2 enzyme (10–50 units) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP at 37 °C for 20 min in kinase buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 μm Na3VO4, and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture). After the phosphorylation reaction, bead-bound GST-β-catenin proteins were washed 2–3 times with the kinase buffer to eliminate unincorporated [γ-32P]GTP. For soluble GST-β-catenin protein, the kinase reactions were stopped by adding 2× sample loading buffer and boiling. These samples were then centrifuged and loaded onto a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis as described below. The gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and autoradiography was performed to visualize 32P-labeled proteins. Efficiency of protein transfer was confirmed by Western blotting with either β-catenin or GST antibodies (see above).Stoichiometry determinations were performed using 1 pmol of purified recombinant wild-type or mutant GST-β-catenin substrate (see below) or synthetic CK2 peptide. Kinase assays were performed as described above using 50 units of recombinant CK2 (1 unit catalyzes 1 pmol/min) and 50 μm [γ-32P]GTP (1760 dpm/pmol). Incorporated counts were determined using P81 filter circles. Raw counts/min were adjusted according to the counting efficiency and values from reactions containing CK2 enzyme and buffer only were subtracted to control for autophosphorylation of CK2. From these, moles of phosphate incorporated per mol of substrate were calculated for duplicate samples.Recombinant β-Catenin-GST Fusion Protein and Truncations—The full-length β-catenin cDNA (from pCI-β-catenin, kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein), encoding a 781-amino acid residue protein, was subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) for bacterial expression of a recombinant GST-β-catenin fusion protein. C-terminal deletions were generated by digestion with EcoRI, producing a cDNA encoding an 421-amino acid residue β-catenin protein retaining 7 CK2 consensus phosphorylation sites (β-cateninΔ1) or with XhoI, producing a cDNA encoding an 88-amino acid residue N-terminal fragment retaining 2 CK2 consensus phosphorylation sites (β-cateninΔ2) (Fig. 3A). These β-catenin constructs or the pGEX2T alone were transformed into competent cells (Invitrogen) and grown in LB with 50 μg/ml ampicillin until the absorbance at 595 nm was between 0.6 and 1.0. The culture was then induced with 0.5 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h. After induction, cells were pelleted at 5,000 rpm and resuspended in NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cells were sonicated for 10 s, three times, to ensure complete disruption. Sonicates were pelleted at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was filtered before incubating with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Roche Diagnostics). After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C with rotation, the beads were washed 3 times with NETN buffer, and centrifuged at 500 rpm at 4 °C. For some experiments, GST-β-catenin was eluted in 3 fractions by competition with free glutathione (3 mg/ml) in 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.4, buffer. Eluted fractions were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for protein analysis, in a Bio-Rad minigel system. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Western blotting was performed as described below to detect recombinant GST-tagged β-catenin protein. Control GST protein was prepared in the same manner.Site-directed Mutagenesis—To identify the site of CK2 phosphorylation in β-catenin experimentally, site-directed mutagenesis was performed. Sequence-specific PCR primers containing the desired mutations were designed according to Stratagene's guidelines. For PCR, double-stranded plasmid DNA was denatured at 95 °C for 30 s and subjected to 18 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 16 min (2 min/kb). This protocol generated mutant PCR products containing staggered nicks. The PCR products were then subjected to DpnI digestion to restrict the methylated and hemimethylated parental DNA, leaving the mutant unmethylated PCR product intact. The products were gel-purified and transformed into Epicurian Coli XL1 Blue supercompetent cells. Colonies were picked, and plasmid miniprep DNA was prepared for sequencing.Mutation of Ser29 to Ala was accomplished using 5′-CACTGGCAGCAACAGGCGTACCTGGACTCTGG-3′ in the sense orientation and its reverse complement. Mutation of Thr59 and Ser60 to Ala was accomplished with the single oligonucleotide primer 5′-GAAGAGGATGTGGATGCCGCCCAAGTCCTGTATGAG-3′ and its reverse complement. Mutation of Thr102 to Ala was accomplished using 5′-GCTATGTTCCCTGAGGCGTTAGATGAGGGCATGC-3′ and its reverse complement. Mutation of Ser111 and Thr112 to Ala was accomplished using 5′-GGGCATGCAGATCCCAGCGGCGCAGTTTGATGCTGCTCATCC-3′ and its reverse complement. Mutation of Ser179 to Ala was accomplished with 5′-GCAGTTATGGTCCATCAGCTTGCGAAAAAGGAAGCTTCCAG-3′ and its reverse complement. Mutation of Thr393 to Ala was accomplished with 5′-GGAATCTTTCAGATGCTGCAGCGAAACAGGAAGGGATGG-3′ and its reverse complement. Mutation of Thr693 to Ala was generated with 5′-GCCAATGGCTTGGAATGAGGCGGCTGATCTTGGACTTG-3′ and its reverse complement. Combinations of multiple mutations were generated through two rounds of mutagenesis. To confirm the presence of the correct β-catenin mutations, the site-directed mutants were sequenced in the DNA Core Sequencing Facility at Boston University School of Medicine.Prediction of CK2 Phosphorylation Sites—To identify the location of the critical phosphorylation sites in β-catenin, the amino acid sequence was scanned with NetPhos 2.0 2www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos. and the predicted serine/threonine phosphorylation sites were compared with the canonical CK2 recognition sequence. Nine residues perfectly fit the consensus for CK2 phosphorylation, and five of these are included in the crystal structure of the central armadillo repeat (arm) domain of mouse β-catenin (Protein Data Bank code 1BCT (49Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Google Scholar, 50Huber O. Korn R. McLaughlin J. Ohsugi M. Herrmann B.G. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 3-10Google Scholar)). The steric environments of these residues (Ser179, Ser246, Thr393, Ser605, and Ser646) were examined using Rasmol to determine the relative degree of solvent exposure and hence potential for binding at the active site of CK2.Xenopus Embryo Injection, Protein Extraction, and Analysis—In vitro fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in 0.1 × Marc's modified Ringer's (51Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Google Scholar). A standard staging system was used (52Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). For microinjection of recombinant GST-β-catenin fusion protein, embryos were transferred to 1.5% Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.5× Marc's modified Ringer's and injected in the animal pole of both blastomeres at the 2-cell stage with 5 nl of purified recombinant GST-β-catenin wild-type or mutant protein. At specified times, eight injected embryos were pooled and homogenized in 0.1× Marc's modified Ringer's with inhibitors (10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, and 25 mm β-glycerophosphate) and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. 2× sample loading buffer was added to the cleared lysates, boiled, and the equivalent of 0.25 embryos was electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membrane was sequentially incubated with 10% goat serum (Sigma), anti-β-catenin antibody (Transduction Laboratories), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Incubations were 1 h each, separated by three 10-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20. Peroxidase activity was visualized with an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). A monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin (Sigma) was used to confirm equal loading. Bands were quantitated using Fluor S phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad) and normalized to α-tubulin. Initial half-lives were interpolated from plots of β-catenin level over time, and statistical analysis was performed using a two-sided Student's t test in Excel.RESULTSInhibition of CK2 Activity Reduces LEF-1-dependent Transcription—Previously, we showed that inhibition of CK2 activity by the selective flavonoid CK2 inhibitor apigenin accelerates the degradation of β-catenin (36Song D.H. Sussman D.J. Seldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23790-23797Google Scholar). Based on this, we predicted that apigenin treatment of cells would reduce TCF/LEF-dependent transcription. To test this hypothesis, COS7 cells were transiently co-transfected with a LEF-1-luciferase reporter and β-galactosidase as a transfection efficiency control. Two different amounts of β-catenin cDNA were transfected into the cells, 0.1 or 0.5 μg, along with 1 μg of LEF-1. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the cells were treated with either apigenin (a selective CK2 inhibitor) or wortmannin (a selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) for an additional 2 h. Extracts were made, assayed for luciferase activity, and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. At either plasmid dose, apigenin-treated cells had reduced LEF-1 reporter activity, whereas wortmannin did not significantly affect transcription of the reporter (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of CK2 but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase reduces β-catenin-LEF-1-dependent transcription.Fig. 1Inhibition of CK2 reduces β-catenin/LEF-1 transcription.A, COS7 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were co-transfected with plasmids encoding LEF-1 luciferase, β-galactosidase, and/or β-catenin (1 μg each unless otherwise noted) either in the absence (–LEF) or presence (+LEF) of LEF-1 cDNA. Two different amounts of β-catenin plasmid (0.1 g and 0.5 μg) were used for each set of transfections. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with the inhibitors (INH) apigenin (80 μm) or wortmannin (25 nm) for an additional 2 h, then the cells were harvested and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed. The graph shows luciferase luminometer counts normalized to β-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiency. Two independent experiments gave similar results. B, COS7 cells were co-transfected with LEF-1, LEF-1 luciferase, β-galactosidase, and β-catenin cDNAs. One set was left untreated, one set was treated with 80 μm apigenin, and the third set was co-transfected with CK2α and α′ kinase inactive mutants. CK2 kinase activity was measured by the incorporation of [γ-32P]GTP into the CK2-specific substrate peptide RRREEETEEE, subtracting background counts obtained without the peptide and normalizing to β-galactosidase activity. C, Western blot analysis of these samples demonstrated that treatment with 80 μm apigenin or overexpression of CK2 kinase inactive mutants decreased β-catenin expression (upper panel); β-actin was used as a loading control (lower panel). D, the same extracts used in B and C were used for LEF-1-dependent luciferase activity. A representative graph of luciferase luminometer counts normalized to β-galactosidase activity is shown (mean ± S.D. of the duplicate transfections); three other independent experiments had similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because the pharmacologic inhibitors of CK2 are not absolutely specific, we employed kinase inactive mutants of CK2α and CK2α′ to confirm our results. In COS7 cells, neither of the inactive catalytic subunits alone significantly reduced CK2 protein, activity, or LEF-1 reporter transcription (data not shown). However, overexpression of both the CK2α and α′"

Rate constants for the reactions of Mn(III) porphyrins with ONOO– ranged from 1 × 105 to 3.4 × 107m–1 s–1 and correlated well with previously reported kinetic and thermodynamic data that reflect the resonance and inductive effects of the substituents on the porphyrin ring. Rate constants for the reactions of Mn(III) porphyrins with CO3·¯ ranged from 2 × 108 to 1.2 × 109m–1s–1 at pH ≤ 8.5 and increased with pH as a consequence of the ionization of the complexes. Mn(II) porphyrins reacted with CO3·¯ with rate constants ranging from 1 × 109 to 5 × 109m–1s–1 at pH 10.4. Hence, fast scavenging of ONOO– and CO3·¯ by manganese porphyrins could occur in vivo because of the catalytic reduction at the expense of a number of cellular reductants. Additionally, we determined the pK a of the axial water molecules of the Mn(III) complexes at pH 7.5–13.2 by spectrophotometric titration. Results were consistent with two acid-base equilibria for most of the complexes studied. The pK a values also correlated with the resonance and inductive effects of the substituents. The correlations of E½ with the rate constants with ONOO– and with the pK a values display a deviation from linearity when N-alkylpyridinium substituents included N-alkyl moieties longer than ethyl, which is interpreted in terms of a decrease in the local dielectric constant.

Metalloporphyrins catalyze numerous redox reactions (1Meunier B. Chem.

A significant fraction of the oxidative biochemistry of peroxynitrite is derived from the rapid reaction of ONOO– with CO2 (k = 5.8 × 104m–1s–1 at 37 °C (18Radi R. Cosgrove T.P. Beckman J.S.

We have proposed that complexes such as MnIIITM-2-PyP can efficiently inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated oxidations even in the presence of CO2 (13Ferrer-Sueta G. Batinic-Haberle I. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, the reaction of MnIIITM-2-PyP with ONOO– in the presence of CO2 produced more oxidation of the metal complex than expected based on simple competition kinetics (13Ferrer-Sueta G. Batinic-Haberle I. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting a probable reaction of the complex with CO3·¯ . The possible reaction of Mn(III) porphyrins with CO3·¯ has also been proposed recently (26Zhang H. Joseph J. Gurney M. Becker D. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in experiments related to the effect of bicarbonate on the peroxidase activity of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase. In aerated aqueous solution, the stable oxidation state of manganese porphyrins used in this study is Mn(III). However, given the low oxygen tension inside the cell, cellular components, like low molecular weight reductants (27Spasojevic I. Batinic-Haberle I. Fridovich I. Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and probably some dehydrogenases (28Faulkner K.M. Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Mn(II) porphyrin chemistry has been studied since the seventies (29Hambright P. Chock P.B. Inorg. Chem. 1974; 13: 3029-3031Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Duncan I.A. Harriman A. Porter G. J.

Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mn(II) porphyrins may have a number of advantages over Mn(III) porphyrins with regard to their scavenging and antioxidant activity. For instance, they could rapidly scavenge oxidizing radicals such as CO3·¯ and yield innocuous products, or they could reduce strong oxidants like ONOO– or H2O2 via a two-electron transfer reaction without producing any secondary radicals. This latter reaction is particularly important if Mn(II) can be regenerated at the expense of readily available biological reductants (14Ferrer-Sueta G. Quijano C. Alvarez B. Radi R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Carbonate radical anion is long known to radiation chemists (32Weeks J.L. Rabani J. J. Phys.

Fridovich I. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 2002; : 2689-2696Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These linear free energy relationships break down if N-alkylpyridinium substituted porphyrins contain alkyl groups longer than ethyl, which has been ascribed to steric and solvation differences in the metal surroundings (39Batinic-Haberle I. Spasojevic I. Stevens R.D. Hambright P. Fridovich I. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 2002; : 2689-2696Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The complexes possess two axially coordinated water molecules, and they can undergo up to two ionization steps in the alkaline pH range. Data in the literature with respect to these ionization reactions are diverse, both in the methods used and in the results. For instance, MnIIITM-4-PyP displays a single pK a of 10 according to 1H NMR (40Yushmanov V.E. Imasato H. Tominaga T.T. Tabak M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1996; 61: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but two pK as at 10.9 and 12.3 (41Chen F. Cheng S. Yu C. Liu M. Su Y.O. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1999; 474: 52-59Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or at 8.0 and 10.6 (42Harriman A. Porter G. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. II. 1979; 75: 1532Crossref Google Scholar) by spectrophotometric titration. In what follows, we examine the reduction of ONOO– by Mn(III) porphyrins and the reaction of both Mn(II) and Mn(III) porphyrins with CO3·¯ . We also use spectrophotometric titration to determine the relevant pK a values. Chemicals—Mn(III) porphyrins used in this work are listed in Table I along with their electric charge at pH 7. MnIIITCPP and MnIIITSPP were purchased from MidCentury Chemicals, Chicago, IL, and the other porphyrins were synthesized as described previously (39Batinic-Haberle I. Spasojevic I. Stevens R.D. Hambright P. Fridovich I. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 2002; : 2689-2696Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite was synthesized from hydrogen peroxide and sodium nitrite in acidic solution (43Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were commercial. Mn(II) porphyrins were prepared by the reduction of Mn(III) porphyrins with equimolar dithionite in N2O-saturated solutions containing 0.1 m carbonate at pH 10.4. Dithionite solution was prepared in helium-saturated solutions containing 0.1 m carbonate at pH 10.4, and its concentration was assessed immediately prior to its use by reduction of Fe(CN)63– (ϵ418 = 1012 m–1cm–1) (44Scaife C.W.J. Wilkins R.G. Inorg. Chem. 1980; 19: 3244-3247Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Table IStructure, abbreviation, and electric charge at pH 7 of the Mn(III) complexes used in this work Methods—Stopped-flow kinetic measurements were carried out using an SX-17MV Stopped-Flow from Applied Photophysics coupled with a 1-cm-long mixing cell. Briefly, Mn(III) porphyrins (0.8 to 6 μm) in acid phosphate solution were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with ONOO– in 10-fold or greater excess, dissolved in a known concentration of NaOH. The reaction was monitored by the change in absorbance in the Soret band of the porphyrin, and the plots were fitted to a simple exponential function. All experiments were carried out at 37 °C. The pH was measured at the outlet of the stopped flow. γ-Radiolysis experiments were carried out with a 137Cs source (Radiation Machinery Corporation Parsippany, NJ). The dose rate (9.8 gray/min) was determined using the Fricke dosimeter (1 mm FeSO4 in 0.8 n H2SO4) based on G(FeIII) = 15.6 and ϵ302(FeIII) = 2200 m–1cm–1. Pulse radiolysis experiments were carried out with a 5-MeV Varian 7715 linear accelerator (0.2–1.5 μs electron pulses, 200 mA current). All measurements were made at room temperature in a 1-cm spectrosil cell using three light passes (optical path length 3.1 cm). A 150-watt xenon-mercury lamp was used as the light source. The detection system included a Bausch & Lomb grating monochromator model D330/D331 Mk.11 and a Hamamatsu R920 photomultiplier. The signal was transferred through a Sony/Tektronix 390AD programmable digitizer to a micro PDP-I 1/24 computer, which operated the whole pulse radiolysis system. Generation of CO3·¯ —The radical was generated upon irradiation of N2O-saturated (∼25 mm) aqueous solutions containing 0.5 m carbonate at pH ≥ 8.5 via the reactions shown below in Equations 2, 3, 4, 5 (the species radiation yields are given in parentheses in Equation 2).

Ionization of Axial Water of Mn(III) Porphyrins—Solutions containing 10 μm Mn(III) porphyrin and 1 m K2CO3 at pH ≥ 13 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with HCl solutions of varying concentrations to yield pH 7.5–13.2. The mixture was made directly in the spectrophotometer cell using a RX2000 rapid mixing accessory from Applied Photophysics. Spectra were recorded from 350 to 600 nm at each pH in a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Spectral data were analyzed using Microcal Origin software. MnIIITSPP was dissolved in 0.1 m K2CO3, because the complex precipitates in more concentrated solutions. Reaction of Mn(III) Porphyrins with Peroxynitrite—The reaction of Mn(III) porphyrins with excess of peroxynitrite was studied by stopped flow. The observed pseudo-first order rate constants were plotted versus peroxynitrite concentration at each pH to obtain the second order constant (k ox), which increases upon increasing the pH. Fig. 1 shows plots of k ox versus pH for four representative complexes. Given that the pK a of ONOOH is 6.6 ± 0.1 (46Kissner R. Nauser T. Bugnon P. Lye P.G. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 47Merényi G. Lind J. Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 5685-5691Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), our results demonstrate, as reported previously for several porphyrin complexes (13Ferrer-Sueta G. Batinic-Haberle I. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), that Mn(III) porphyrins react faster with ONOO– than with ONOOH. 2The electric charge of the complexes in the equations only considers the formal charge of the metal ion and the atoms directly bound to it, thus Mn(III) porphyrin is MnIIIP+, Mn(II) porphyrin is MnIIP, and O = Mn(IV) porphyrin is O = MnIVP. MmIIIP++ONOO-→O=MnIVP+·NO2(Eq. 6) MmIIIP++ONOOH→O=MnIVP+·NO2+H+(Eq. 7) ONOOH⇆ONOO-+H+pKa(Eq. 8) Hence, the effective second-order rate constant of the reaction of Mn(III) porphyrin with peroxynitrite (k ox) is pH-dependent and is given by Equation 9, where k 6 and k 7 are the rate constants of the reactions shown in Equations 6 and 7, respectively. kox=(k6Ka+k7[H+])/(Ka+H+)(Eq. 9) Table II summarizes the values of k 6 and pK a obtained for all ten complexes. The pH profiles of all cationic complexes fit Equation 9 assuming that k 7 was very small or zero. In the case of MnIIITSPP, a value of k 7 < 105m–1s–1 can be put forward whereas MnIIITCPP did not display any significant variation in k ox in the pH range from 6.4 to 7.5. It is important to remember that a value of 105m–1s–1 is at the low end of the rate constants measurable by the method used herein. The pK a values of ONOOH obtained in the case of all cationic complexes fall below the literature value of 6.6 although it is higher for the anionic MnIIITSPP (Table II). This variation can be explained if the derived pK a values belong to the outer-sphere complex between ONOO– and Mn(III) porphyrin, and the value deviates from 6.6 because of the relative stabilization of ONOO– by the electric charge on the Mn(III) porphyrin.Table IISecond order rate constants for the reaction shown in Equation 6 and apparent pKa values for peroxynitrite obtained from fitting the data of kox to Equation 9, at 37 ± 0.1 °CComplexk6pKaM-1S-1MnIII TM-2-PyP1.9 ± 0.1 × 107aFrom Ref 13.6.2 ± 0.1MnIII TE-2-PyP3.4 ± 0.1 × 1076.4 ± 0.1MnIII TnPr-2-PyP1.4 ± 0.01 × 1076.1 ± 0.1MnIII TnBu-2-PyP1.3 ± 0.03 × 1076.2 ± 0.1MnIII TnHex-2-PyP1.3 ± 0.04 × 1076.3 ± 0.1MnIII TnOct-2-PyP1.4 ± 0.05 × 1076.1 ± 0.1MnIII TM-3-PyP4.2 ± 0.1 × 106aFrom Ref 13.6.1 ± 0.1MnIII TM-4-PyP4.3 ± 0.2 × 106aFrom Ref 13.6.3 ± 0.1MnIII TSPP3.4 ± 0.6 × 1057.4 ± 0.3MnIII TCPP1.0 ± 0.1 × 105NDa From Ref 13Ferrer-Sueta G.

Open table in a new tab Ionization of Axial Water Molecules— Fig. 2A displays the spectral changes experienced by MnIIITM-2-PyP upon the change in pH from 8.8 to 12.8. No isosbestic point was detectable in the region from 300 to 600 nm, implying that more than one equilibrium is involved. Panel B shows the spectrophotometric titration curve at 454 nm, which is the λmax for this complex at acidic and neutral pH. The plot displays a minimum and two inflection points, which is consistent with two ionization steps (pK a1 and pK a2) shown below in Equations 10 and 11, respectively. H2O-MnIIIP+⇆HO-MnIIIP+H+(Eq. 10) HO-MnIIIP⇆O=MnIIIP-+H+(Eq. 11) The spectral data were fitted to Equation 12, shown below, where H2A+ represents H2O-MnIIIP+, HA represents OH-MnIIIP, and A– represents O = MnIIIP–.

The parameter AbsH2A+ was obtained from the mean experimental value at the lowest pH. MnIIITCPP and MnIIITSPP showed a simpler behavior within the pH range studied, which was consistent with only one ionization equilibrium; nevertheless, reported data suggest another pK a below 14 (48Carnieri N.

Open table in a new tab Spectral Changes upon Oxidation and Reduction of Mn(III) Porphyrins—Oxidation and reduction of Mn(III) porphyrin were carried out by γ-radiolysis to assess the spectral changes at 500–650 nm. O = Mn(IV) porphyrin was produced via the reaction shown in Equation 13 in N2O-saturated solutions containing 0.5 m carbonate at pH 10.5. MnIIIP++CO3·¯+H2O→O=MnIVP+CO32-+2H+(Eq. 13) Mn(II) porphyrin was generated through the reaction shown in Equation 14, shown below, in N2O-saturated solutions containing 0.1 m 2-propanol and 50 mm phosphate at pH 7 as described previously (49Morehouse K.M. Neta P. J. Phys. Chem. 1984; 88: 1575-1579Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MnIIIP++[(CH3)2COH]·→MnIIP+(CH3)2CO+H+(Eq. 14) Difference spectra were calculated as oxidized minus reduced complex. The difference spectra are exemplified in Fig. 3 for MnIIITM-2-PyP. In all cases the changes in absorbance associated with the Mn(III) to Mn(IV) transition is about four times larger than that for the Mn(II) to Mn(III) transition. Kinetics of the Oxidation of Mn(III) Porphyrins by CO3·¯ —The reaction of 2–4 μmCO3·¯ with 15–60 μm Mn(III) porphyrin was studied at pH 8.5–13 by pulse radiolysis. The reaction could not be studied at pH < 8.5, because the rate of carbonate oxidation by ·OH (Equations 4 and 5) decrease substantially with the decrease in the pH, i.e. pKa(HCO3–/CO32–) = 10.2. The reaction was followed at 570–575 nm for MnIIIT-(alkyl)-2(3,4)-PyP5+ and at 595 nm for MnIIITCPP3– and MnIIITSPP3–. The changes in the absorbance obeyed first-order kinetics, and k obs was linearly dependent on the porphyrin concentration (Fig. 4) and increased upon increasing the pH as shown in Fig. 5 for four representative complexes. The pH profiles of k 13 were fitted to Equation 15, below, and the results are presented in Table IV. k13=(kbasicKaapp+kacid[H+])/(Kaapp+H+)(Eq. 15) Fig. 5The effect of pH on k 13 for four representative complexes: MnIIITM-4-PyP (squares), MnIIITM-2-PyP (circles), MnIIITSPP (triangles), and MnIIITCPP (inverted triangles). The increment of k 13 with pH correlates with deprotonation of water molecules axially coordinated to the manganese. Solid lines represent the best fits to Equation 15.

Previous in vitro studies demonstrated ethanol-impaired neuronal survival with reduced signaling through the insulin receptor (IRβ). We examined insulin signaling in an experimental rat model of chronic gestational exposure to ethanol in which the pups exhibited striking cerebellar hypoplasia with increased apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses detected reduced levels of tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRβ, tyrosyl-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and p85-associated IRS-1 but no alterations in IRβ, IRS-1, or p85 protein expression in cerebellar tissue from ethanol-exposed pups. In addition, ethanol exposure significantly reduced the levels of total phosphoinositol 3-kinase, Akt kinase, phospho-BAD (inactive), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and increased the levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity, activated BAD, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein, and PTEN phosphatase activity in cerebellar tissue. Cerebellar neurons isolated from ethanol-exposed pups had reduced levels of insulin-stimulated phosphoinositol 3-kinase and Akt kinase activities and reduced insulin inhibition of PTEN and glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity. The results demonstrate that cerebellar hypoplasia produced by chronic gestational exposure to ethanol is associated with impaired survival signaling through insulin-regulated pathways, including failure to suppress PTEN function.

The results demonstrate that cerebellar hypoplasia produced by chronic gestational exposure to ethanol is associated with impaired survival signaling through insulin-regulated pathways, including failure to suppress PTEN function. Ethanol exposure during development is one of the leading causes of mental retardation in Europe and North America. Heavy gestational exposure to ethanol can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, which encompasses a broad array of neurologic and systemic lesions including central nervous system (CNS) malformations such as microencephaly, reduced cerebral white matter volume, ventriculomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, and disorders of neuronal migration (1Clarren S.K.

The present study was designed to examine the effects of chronic gestational exposure to ethanol on insulin-, IRS-1-, and PI3 kinase-mediated signaling in the intact brain to determine the extent to which abnormalities in these pathways correlate with ethanol-induced developmental defects in the CNS. PTEN expression and activity were also examined, because PTEN dephosphorylates and negatively regulates PI3 kinase function (38Dahia P.L. Aguiar R.C. Alberta J. Kum J.B. Caron S. Sill H. Marsh D.J. Ritz J. Freedman A. Stiles C. Eng C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and the effects of ethanol on phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10 (PTEN) were unknown. Cerebellar tissue was studied, because it represents a major in vivo target of ethanol neurotoxicity (2Maier S.E. West J.R. Alcohol. 2001; 23: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 39Mohamed S.A. Nathaniel E.J. Nathaniel D.R. Snell L. Exp. Neurol. 1987; 97: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In Vivo Model of Chronic Ethanol Exposure—Long-Evans female rats were adapted to an ethanol-containing or isocaloric control liquid diet (BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ) over a 3-week interval, after which they were mated with normal males. Ethanol comprised 11.8, 23.6, and 35.4% of the caloric content of the feedings during the first, second, and third weeks of adaptation. The 35.4% ethanol-containing or control diets were maintained throughout pregnancy. Using this protocol, the serum ethanol concentrations in the rats ranged from 25 to 43 mm, which is within the range observed in human disease states (40Urso T. Gavaler J.S. Van T.D. Life Sci. 1981; 28: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Rats were monitored daily to ensure equivalent caloric consumption and maintenance of body weight. Typically, in the ethanol-fed group, the litter sizes were reduced by 20%, and pup mean body weight was reduced by 10 to 15%. Studies were conducted with cerebella harvested from control and ethanol-exposed postnatal day 2 (P2) pups to evaluate the effects of ethanol in the early postnatal period and prior to the occurrence of any major compensatory developmental responses. Cerebellar tissue was fixed in Histochoice fixative (Amresco, Solon, OH) and embedded in paraffin. Histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to detect morphological abnormalities. Fresh cerebellar tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for use in protein studies, assays of kinase or phosphatase activity, and measurement of PTEN mRNA levels. In Situ Assays for Apoptosis—The terminal transferase dUTP end-labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect nicked or fragmented DNA in cryostat sections of cerebella. TUNEL assays were performed using fluorescein-labeled dUTP ([Fl]dUTP; Invitrogen) and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (17de la Monte S.M. Ganju N. Banerjee K. Brown N.V. Luong T. Wands J.R. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2000; 24: 716-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled DNA was detected with biotinylated secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated Streptavidin, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) as the substrate. To detect nuclear pyknosis and fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis, adjacent sections were stained with Hoechst H33258 (1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 min at room temperature. The slides were rinsed thoroughly in phosphate-buffered saline, cover-slipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Adjacent sections were immunostained with polyclonal antibodies to activated (cleaved) caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Histological sections were prepared for immunostaining according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoreactivity was detected with biotinylated secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated Streptavidin, and the BCIP/NBT substrate. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation Studies—For Western blot analysis, tissue from individual cerebella were polytron homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin) (41Bonifacino J.S.

For immunoprecipitations, homogenates were prepared in Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as indicated. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifuging the samples at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatant fractions were used in the studies. Protein concentration was measured with the bis-chloracetate (BCA) assay (Pierce). 60- or 100-μg protein aliquots were used for Western blot analysis (17de la Monte S.M. Ganju N. Banerjee K.

Immunoreactivity was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Immunoreactivity was quantified using the Eastman Kodak Co. Digital Science Imaging Station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Kinase Assays—PI3 kinase activity was measured in p85 immunoprecipitates (42Banerjee K. Mohr L. Wands J.R. de la Monte S.M. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1998; 22: 2093-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained from individual 500-μg protein samples using rabbit polyclonal anti-p85 (1 μg/ml) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates complexed with protein A-Sepharose were suspended in 50 μl of TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), and reactions were initiated by sequentially adding 20 μg of sonicated phosphatidylinositol (10 μl), 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, and 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP working solution composed of 0.88 mm [γ-32P]ATP (30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/3000 Ci/mmol), 20 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm cold ATP. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and 300 rpm and stopped by adding 15 μl of 6 n HCl. Phospholipids extracted with chloroform/methanol were analyzed by thin layer chromatography using plates pre-coated with 1% potassium oxalate (Merck). PI3 kinase activity was detected by film autoradiography and quantified using the Kodak Digital Science Imaging Station. To measure Akt and GSK-3β kinase activities, corresponding immunoprecipitates captured onto protein A-Sepharose beads (41Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. Springer T.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

Reactions were performed by sequentially adding 10 μl each of Mg2+/ATP mixture (100 mm non-radioactive ATP, 75 mm MgCl2 in ADB), [γ-32P]ATP (diluted to a final concentration of 1 μCi/μl using Mg2+/ATP mixture), and 10 nm synthetic peptide substrate. Crosstide (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was used to measure Akt activity, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used as the substrate for GSK-3β (Upstate Biotechnology). Reactions were incubated for 10 (GSK-3) or 15 (Akt) min at 30 °C and 300 rpm and then terminated by adding 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. 10 μl of each reaction were spotted in duplicate onto P81 phosphocellulose. Nonspecific counts were removed by washing the P81 three times in 0.85% phosphoric acid (41Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. Springer T.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

[γ-32P]ATP incorporation was measured in a TopCount machine (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). PTEN Studies—PTEN expression was measured by Western blot analysis and real-time quantitative reverse-transcribed (RT)-PCR assays. In addition, PTEN phosphatase activity was measured in PTEN immunoprecipitates using the Biomol Green Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Phosphatase inhibitors were omitted from the lysis buffer. For the real-time RT-PCR studies, total RNA was isolated from cerebellar tissue homogenates using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples containing 2 μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed using the AMV First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and random oligodeoxynucleotide primers. Highly conserved regions of PTEN and 18 S cDNAs isolated from rat cerebellar tissue by RT-PCR were cloned into the PCRII vector (Invitrogen) and used to generate standard curves for determining transcript abundance. PCR amplifications were performed using 25-μl reaction volumes containing 20 ng of RT product, 0.4 μm each of forward and reverse primers (Table I), and SYBR Green I PCR reagent (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). The amplified signals were detected continuously with the Bio-Rad iCycler and iCycler iQ MultiColor Real Time PCR Detection System (Hercules, CA). The following real-time PCR amplification protocol was used: 1) initial denaturation, 95 °C for 10 min; 2) a three-segment amplification and quantification program consisting of 40 cycles of 95 °C × 60 s, 60 °C × 45 s and 72 °C for 30 s; and 3) a cooling step down to 4 °C.Table IForward (for) and reverse (rev) primers used for PTEN and 18 S RT-PCR amplificationPrimerSequence (5′ → 3′)Position (nucleotide)PTEN forGGA AAG GAC GGA CTG GTG TA380PTEN revTGC CAC TGG TCT GTA ATC CA55718 S forGGA CCA GAG CGA AAG CAT98518 S revTCA ATC TCG GGT GGC TGA A1462 Open table in a new tab In Vitro Experiments—In vitro experiments were used to examine the effects of ethanol on PTEN expression, phosphorylation, and phosphatase activity in CNS neurons and to determine whether the responses observed in vivo were mediated by impaired insulin or IGF-1 signaling. Primary neuronal cultures were generated with cerebellar tissue harvested from P2 pups (44Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting demonstrated that greater than 95% of cells isolated from control or ethanol-exposed pup cerebella were neuronal as evidenced by the immunoreactivity with antibodies to HuC/HuD neuron-specific RNA binding protein (45Szabo A.

Cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm non-essential amino acid mixture (Invitrogen), 25 mm KCl, and 9 g/liter glucose. After overnight seeding, cells were treated with 6 μm cytosine arabinoside to inhibit DNA synthesis. Cultures were exposed to 50 mm ethanol or nothing for 2 days using sealed humidified chambers (17de la Monte S.M. Ganju N. Banerjee K. Brown N.V. Luong T. Wands J.R. Alcohol Clin. Exp.

PTEN protein was detected by Western blot analysis. PTEN phosphorylation was evaluated by PTEN Western blot analysis of anti-phospho-serine/phospho-threonine immunoprecipitates. PTEN phosphatase activity was measured in PTEN immunoprecipitates using the Biomol Green Reagent (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). To examine the effects of ethanol on insulin-stimulated viability and kinase activity, primary neuronal cultures were generated with cerebella harvested from control or ethanol-exposed P1 pups. However, to mimic the in vivo model in which the ethanol exposure was discontinued after birth, the cultured cells were not further exposed to ethanol. Micro-cultures (96-well plates) in which 5 × 104 viable cells (determined by Trypan Blue exclusion) were seeded per well were used for viability assays, and 60-mm Petri dish cultures were used for kinase or PTEN phosphatase assays. To measure insulin-stimulated responses, after 1 day in culture, the cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then stimulated with 50 nm insulin (Humulin; Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN). Viability was measured after 24 h of insulin stimulation using the crystal violet assay (13de la Monte S.M. Neely T.R. Cannon J. Wands J.R. Cell. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2080644905,"Loss-of-function mutations of gap junction proteins, connexins, represent a mechanism of disease in a variety of tissues. We have shown that recessive (gene deletion) or dominant (connexin45 overexpression) disruption of connexin43 function results in osteoblast dysfunction and abnormal expression of osteoblast genes, including down-regulation of osteocalcin transcription. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of gap junction-sensitive transcriptional regulation, we systematically analyzed the rat osteocalcin promoter for sensitivity to gap junctional intercellular communication. We identified an Sp1/Sp3 containing complex that assembles on a minimal element in the –70 to –57 region of the osteocalcin promoter in a gap junction-dependent manner. This CT-rich connexin-response element is necessary and sufficient to confer gap junction sensitivity to the osteocalcin proximal promoter. Repression of osteocalcin transcription occurs as a result of displacement of the stimulatory Sp1 by the inhibitory Sp3 on the promoter when gap junctional communication is perturbed. Modulation of Sp1/Sp3 recruitment also occurs on the collagen Iα1 promoter and translates into gap junction-sensitive transcriptional control of collagen Iα1 gene expression. Thus, regulation of Sp1/Sp3 recruitment to the promoter may represent a potential general mechanism for transcriptional control of target genes by signals passing through gap junctions.

Gap junctions are transcellular channels formed by juxtaposition of two connexon hemichannels, hexameric structures present on adjacent cells, allowing direct intracellular communication via diffusion of ions, metabolites, and small signaling molecules. These hemichannels are composed of six protein subunits, connexins. Connexins are a family of gap junction proteins encoded by at least 17 different genes (1Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Guldenagel M. Deutsch U. Sohl G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 725-737Google Scholar). Connexins can assemble as a homomeric or heteromeric hemichannel, and the connexin isotypes that form the gap junction hemichannels dictate the molecular size and permeability of the resulting gap junction channel (2Martinez A.D.

In coupled cells, numerous gap junctions assemble between adjacent cells forming large gap junctional plaques. Gap junctional communication plays a critical role in many cellular functions, as well as in development and embryogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 7Levin M. J. Membr.

Identification of signaling events that are initiated and maintained at gap junctional plaques would give critical insights into how gap junctions modulate cellular function in health and disease. One possible biological mechanism by which gap junctional communication affects cell function is via modulation of gene transcription, an action that is very likely initiated by signals passing through the gap junction channels. Indeed, disruption of gap junctional communication has been shown to affect the transcription of many genes in many tissues (18Kojima T. Spray D.C. Kokai Y. Chiba H. Mochizuki Y. Sawada N. Exp.

In bone, ablation of the major gap junction protein expressed in osteoblasts, connexin43 (Cx43), 1The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CxRE, connexin-response element; ORF, open reading frame; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; mut, mutant. results in delayed intramembranous ossification in the skull, delayed endochondral ossification of the axial skeleton, and a generalized osteoblast dysfunction (25Lecanda F. Warlow P.M. Sheikh S. Furlan F. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-944Google Scholar). Among the defects observed in osteoblasts isolated from Cx43 null mice is down-regulation of expression of several genes critical for bone formation, including osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, and type I collagen (25Lecanda F. Warlow P.M. Sheikh S. Furlan F. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-944Google Scholar). Likewise, disruption of gap junctional coupling in osteoblastic cells by treatment with gap junction inhibitors results in down-regulation of osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein (26Schiller P.C. D'Ippolito G. Balkan W. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. Bone. 2001; 28: 362-369Google Scholar, 27Schiller P.C. D'Ippolito G. Brambilla R. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14133-14138Google Scholar). The rat osteosarcoma cell line, ROS17/2.8, is coupled exclusively by gap junctions formed by Cx43 (28Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Geist S.T. Robertson A.J. Hick E. Veenstra R.D. Wang H.-Z. Warlow P.M. Westphale E.M. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 744-750Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that overexpression of connexin45 (Cx45), which forms gap junctions with a decreased size and opposite charge selectivity to that of Cx43 channels, in ROS17/2.8 cells (ROS/Cx45) results in a drastic decrease in chemical and electrical coupling of the resulting gap junctions, indicating that in a mixed Cx43/Cx45 environment the biophysical properties of Cx45 prevail. Thus, Cx45 acts as a partial dominant negative connexin for Cx43 (2Martinez A.D. Hayrapetyan V. Moreno A.P. Beyer E.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1100-1107Google Scholar, 3Koval M. Geist S.T.

By using this model of Cx45 overexpression to inhibit gap junctional communication, we and others (29Li Z. Zhou Z. Yellowley C.E. Donahue H.J. Bone. 1999; 25: 661-666Google Scholar, 30Lecanda F. Towler D.A. Ziambaras K. Cheng S.-L. Koval M. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2249-2258Google Scholar) have observed close similarities between ROS/Cx45 and osteoblasts derived from mice in which the Cx43 gene has been ablated, including transcriptional down-regulation of osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein and up-regulation of osteopontin transcription. In this study, we have further exploited the partial dominant negative action of Cx45 on Cx43 to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which gap junctional communication modulates gene transcription. By using the osteocalcin promoter as a primary readout, we have identified a minimal element in the proximal promoter of this gene that is sensitive to gap junctional communication. We also identified the complex binding this element as containing the ubiquitous transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, and we demonstrate that Sp1 can activate transcription from this element, whereas Sp3 represses transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that gap junctional communication regulates transcription by altering the recruitment of Sp1/Sp3 to the promoter, an action that is common to the collagen Ia1 (col1A1) gene as well. Thus, modulation of Sp1 and Sp3 recruitment is one mechanism by which intercellular signals propagated through gap junctions alter gene transcription.

ROS17/2.8 cells stably transfected with chick Cx45 (ROS/Cx45) have been described previously (3Koval M. Geist S.T. Westphale E.M. Kemendy A.E. Civitelli R. Beyer E.C. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 987-995Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and used at passage numbers between 3 and 14. Drosophila SL2 cells were obtained from Dr. Ross Cagan (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and cultured in Schneider cell medium + 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Reverse Transcription and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from confluent cultures of ROS17/2.8 and ROS/Cx45 cells. RNA (2 μg) was DNase I-treated and then reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers. One-fortieth of this reaction was used for real time PCR analysis of gene expression, using SYBR Green I dye chemistry. PCR product accumulation was monitored using a GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The mean cycle threshold value (Ct) from triplicate samples was used to calculate gene expression. PCR products were normalized to levels of GAPDH. Relative gene expression levels were determined as described in User's Bulletin (P/N 4303859) from Applied Biosystems. The gene-specific primers used are as follows: OC-F, CCAGCGACTCTGAGTCTGACAA, and OC-R, CCGGAGTCTATTCACCACCTTACT; COL1A1-F, CGAAGGCAACAGTCGATTCA, and COL1A1-R, CCCCAAGTTCCGGTGTGA. Rodent GAPDH primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the methods of Dignam et al. (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) with the addition of 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Extracts were dialyzed against Dignam buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and stored in 50-μl aliquots at –70 °C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described previously (32Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 pmol of gel-purified oligonucleotides were labeled with Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dCTP. Binding reactions were performed in the presence of 0.1 pmol of labeled oligonucleotide, 10 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), and 2 μg of nuclear extract. Total reaction volume was adjusted to 15 μl with Dignam buffer D. For supershift experiments, 2 μg of antibody was added to the binding reaction. Binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at 25 °C. The samples were electrophoresed on NOVEX 4–20% polyacrylamide gels in 0.375× TBE. Gels were dried, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. The following oligonucleotides were used in this study (numeration is relative to the transcription start site of the rat osteocalcin promoter): CT, GGTCTCCTGCCCCTCCTGCT; Sp1, ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC; mutated Sp1, ATTCGATCGGTTCGGGGCGAGC; Mzf1, ATTCGAAGTGGGGAGAGC; –146 to –125, CCTGCAGTCACCAACCACAGCAT; –120 to –100, GGGTTTGACCTATTGCGCAC; AP1, GGCGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA. Plasmid Constructs—The rat osteocalcin promoter-luciferase reporter construct (–92-OCLUC) contains the –92 to +32 5′-flanking sequence of the osteocalcin gene, relative to the transcriptional start site. This region was cloned into the KpnI/MluI sites of pGL2Basic plasmid as described by Towler et al. (32Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Google Scholar). In order to generate the CT-RSVLUC construct, CT-containing oligonucleotides, CGATCTCCTGCCCCTCCTGCTGGAC and CAGCAGGAGGGGCAGGAGATCGGTAC, were annealed, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and ligated into the KpnI site of a minimal RSVLUC promoter (33Towler D.A. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Google Scholar). The –92ΔCT-OCLUC construct, in which the CT element was deleted from the –92 osteocalcin promoter, was generated by amplifying the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the CT element, respectively, by PCR from the –92-OCLUC construct. The resulting PCR fragments were gel-purified, blunt-end ligated to each other, and cloned into the KpnI/MluI sites of pGL2Basic. The –92mtCT-OCLUC construct was generated by sequential PCR using forward (GCATCTCCTGCCCCgaCTGCT) and reverse (TAATGTAAGCAGtcGGGGC) primers mutated in the indicated (lowercase) position (34Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 8.5.1-8.5.10Google Scholar). In order to generate the col1A1 heterologous promoter (COL1A1Sp-RSVLUC), oligonucleotides flanking the two Sp1 sites in the rat collagen Iα1 proximal promoter were used to PCR-amplify the proximal promoter region, COL1A1 Promoter-F, TGGACTCCTTTCCCTTCCTT; COL1A1 Promoter-R, GAACCCTGCCTCTTGGAGA. The amplified product was gel-purified, the ends blunted using Klenow fragment, phosphorylated, and ligated into a blunted KpnI site of a minimal RSVLUC promoter (33Towler D.A. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Google Scholar). The constructs used for overexpression of Sp1 (pCMV-Sp1) and Sp3 (pCMV-Sp3, pPacSp3) were kindly provided by Dr. Guntram Suske (Philips-Universitat Marburg, Germany). The pPac0 and pPacSp1 were provided by Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley). The pSFFV-Cx45 plasmid was provided by Dr. Thomas Steinberg. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the identity of the insert. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Assays—ROS17/2.8 cells were seeded at high density (2.5 × 105 cells/well) in 24-well plates. Eighteen hours later, the cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmid using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to manufacturer's direction. After 48 h, the cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase activity was monitored using an Optocomp luminometer. Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfection with a β-galactosidase reporter. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated 2–5 times. For the Drosophila SL2 cell line, cells were seeded at 5.0 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. Eighteen hours later the cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (35Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Google Scholar). After 4 h, the cells were glycerol-shocked in 10% glycerol, rinsed three times in PBS, and then allowed to recover in growth media. After 48 h the cells were rinsed in PBS and then lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase activity was monitored using an Optocomp luminometer. Data were normalized to protein content as determined by the Bradford method. Transfections were performed in triplicate wells and repeated three times. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitations—SDS sample buffer was added to luciferase extracts, described above. Samples were sonicated three times for 10 s each. Insoluble material was pelleted, and the supernatants were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk, probed with goat anti-Sp1 (1:2000) or rabbit anti-Sp3 (1:2000) antibodies, and detected with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:5000) and ECL detection reagents. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 500 μg of nuclear extract and 3 μg of rabbit anti-Sp1 or rabbit anti-Sp3 antibodies. Immunoprecipitated material was collected using protein A/G plus. Washed immunoprecipitated material was eluted in SDS sample buffer, immunoblotted, and probed with anti-phosphoserine, -phosphothreonine, or -acetyl lysine antibodies. The blots were then reprobed with anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 antibodies, respectively, to compare the amount of immunoprecipitated material. Formaldehyde Cross-linking and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation— Formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described by Shang et al. (36Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2002; 103: 843-852Google Scholar). Briefly, ROS17/2.8 and ROS/Cx45 cells were grown to confluence, rinsed twice in PBS, and cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were collected and lysed, and the fixed chromatin was sonicated 10 times for 10 s each. Sheared genomic DNA was electrophoresed on an agarose gel to ensure complete shearing of the DNA. The cross-linked chromatin was diluted with IP buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), precleared with protein A/G plus, and then immunoprecipitated with goat anti-Sp1, rabbit anti-Sp3, or goat anti-Cx43. The immunoprecipitated material was then washed and eluted as described by Shang et al. (36Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2002; 103: 843-852Google Scholar). Protein cross-links were reversed by heating overnight at 65 °C. DNA was purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit. For PCR, 1 μl from a 50-μl extraction was used per reaction. Titration of PCR conditions was performed to ensure experiments were performed in a linear range of amplification. PCR primers used are as follows: OC Promoter-F, CCAATTAGTCCTGGCAGCAT; OC Promoter-R, TTGCTGTGTGGGACTTGTCT; OC ORF-F, CCTGGTCACAGTGGTAAGCA; OC ORF-R, GTTCCATGAGGGCCACATAC; COL1A1 Promoter-F, TGGACTCCTTTCCCTTCCTT; COL1A1 Promoter-R, GAACCCTGCCTCTTGGAGA; COL1A1 ORF-F, GGAGAGAGTGCCAACTCCAG; and COL1A1 ORF-R, CCACCCCAGGGATAAAAACT. Densitometry of Band Intensity—Autoradiographs were scanned, and band intensities were volume-quantitated using ImageQuant version 5.2 software. Background correction was performed using the local median background levels. Connexin-sensitive Protein-DNA Complexes Form on the Proximal Osteocalcin Promoter—Overexpression of Cx45 in ROS17/2.8 cells, which are normally highly coupled by gap junctions formed by Cx43, reduces gap junctional permeability to negatively charged dyes (2Martinez A.D. Hayrapetyan V. Moreno A.P. Beyer E.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1100-1107Google Scholar, 28Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Geist S.T. Robertson A.J. Hick E. Veenstra R.D. Wang H.-Z. Warlow P.M. Westphale E.M. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 744-750Google Scholar). Confirming our previous report (30Lecanda F. Towler D.A. Ziambaras K. Cheng S.-L. Koval M. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2249-2258Google Scholar), overexpression of Cx45 in ROS17/2.8 cells also decreases osteocalcin gene transcription, as assessed by real time PCR (Fig. 1A). To identify the core element and understand the molecular mechanisms of Cx45-mediated transcriptional repression, we first mapped the element responsible for the Cx45 induced down-regulation of osteocalcin promoter basal activity, using promoter deletion constructs cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter. A ∼3-fold repression of osteocalcin promoter activity was observed with all deletion constructs tested, indicating that the gap junction-sensitive transcriptional repression was contained within the –92 to + 32 rat osteocalcin promoter (Fig. 1B). Further shortening of this region at the 5′ end resulted in decreased basal activity that precluded detection of an inhibitory effect. As an alternative strategy, we used EMSA to search for binding activities that were altered by Cx45 overexpression. Nuclear extracts were isolated from ROS17/2.8 and from several clonal ROS cell lines stably overexpressing Cx45 (ROS/Cx45 clone C and clone E in Fig. 2; clone D in Fig. 3). A protein-DNA complex whose binding activity was altered by overexpression of Cx45 was identified in a CT-rich stretch of DNA in the –74 to –56 osteocalcin promoter (Fig. 2). The slow migrating complex assembling on the –74 to –56 (CT element) oligonucleotide probe was reproducibly increased ∼2-fold in ROS/Cx45 extracts compared with ROS17/2.8 in EMSA (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 versus 2 and lanes 3 versus 4, arrowhead). In order to confirm that the alteration in binding activity on the CT element was indeed sequence-specific, EMSAs were subsequently performed using radiolabeled CT element, –120 to –100 and –146 to –125 oligonucleotides. As predicted, the putative connexin-sensitive complex assembled on the CT oligonucleotides (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3, arrowhead), and its binding activity was increased in ROS/Cx45 extracts relative to native cells. The –120 to –100 (spanning C/EBP and hox-binding sites) and –146 to –125 (spanning a fibroblast growth factor-response element and a runx2-binding site) oligonucleotide probes assembled equal binding activities using the same nuclear extracts (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–9), demonstrating the specificity of the change observed on the CT element. To validate further the specificity of increased binding in the extracts, radiolabeled AP1 cognate oligonucleotides were used as a negative control (i.e. a complex that is not regulated by perturbation in gap junctional communication). Comparison of AP1 binding between ROS17/2.8 and ROS/Cx45 extracts revealed identical binding activity, whereas binding of the slow migrating complex to the CT element was increased in Cx45-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B), establishing the CT element as containing a putative connexin-response element (CxRE).Fig. 2Protein-DNA complexes assembling on the rat osteocalcin proximal promoter are sensitive to gap junctions.A, the –146 to +1 rat osteocalcin proximal promoter is shown with the CT-rich region in boldface with underlines. Numbering is relative to the transcriptional start site. B, EMSAs were performed using radiolabeled double-stranded CT oligonucleotides. Nuclear extracts were prepared from ROS17/2.8 cells (lanes 1 and 3) or independent stably transfected clones of ROS/Cx45 cells (clone C, lane 2; clone E, lane 4). Note the increase in binding activity in the slower migrating complex (arrowhead) in ROS/Cx45 extract (lanes 2 and 4) compared with ROS17/2.8 extract (lanes 1 and 3). Quantitation of the intensity of the indicated slow migrating complex (arrow) is shown in the bar graph to the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Protein-DNA complexes assembling on the osteocalcin CT element are sensitive to gap junctions.A, EMSAs were performed using radiolabeled CT (lanes 1–3), –120 to –100 (lanes 4–6), or –146 to –125 (lanes 7–9) oligonucleotides. Comparison of nuclear extracts prepared from ROS17/2.8 cells (lane 2) and nuclear extracts prepared from ROS/Cx45 cells (clone D; lane 3) revealed differential DNA binding activities on the CT element. The slow migrating complex (arrowhead) assembled on the CT element is more abundant in ROS/Cx45 extracts compared with ROS17/2.8 extracts. No difference in binding activities between the same extracts was observed using other probes (lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9). Quantitation of the intensity of the indicated slow migrating complex (arrowhead) is shown in the bar graph below. Lanes 1, 4, and 7 contain no extract. B, EMSAs were performed using radiolabeled CT or AP1 cognate oligonucleotides. Nuclear extracts were prepared from ROS17/2.8 and additional clonal lines of connexin45 stably transfected cells, ROS/Cx45 C and E. As observed for ROS/Cx45 clone D, the binding of the indicated complex (arrowhead) to the CT element was increased in both the E and C extracts (lanes 2 and 6, respectively), as compared with ROS17/2.8 extract (lanes 1 and 5). In contrast, binding of the same nuclear extract to an AP1 cognate was not affected by overexpression of Cx45 (lanes 3 versus 4 and lanes 7 versus 8). Quantitation of the intensity of the indicated slow migrating complex (arrowhead) is shown in the bar graph below. Quantitation of binding activity to the AP1 and –146 to –125 oligonucleotides is based on densitometric analysis of the most abundant (i.e. slowest migrating) complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Identification of the CT Element as a Connexin-sensitive Unit—To establish that the CT element is in fact a gap junction-sensitive transcriptional unit, the –74 to –56 region of the osteocalcin promoter, spanning the CT element was cloned into an RSV minimal promoter upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (CT-RSVLUC). Cotransfection of CT-RSVLUC and a Cx45 expression vector (pSFFV-Cx45) or a control vector (pcDNA33) into ROS17/2.8 cells revealed a 2.4-fold decrease in transcription in cells overexpressing Cx45 (Fig. 4A). To verify that this effect was gap junction-mediated, ROS17/2.8 cells were treated with 100 μm oleamide, a chemical inhibitor of gap junctional communication, 24 h after transfection with CT-RSVLUC reporter. Treatment with the gap junction inhibitor mimicked the effect of Cx45 overexpression, repressing 2.2-fold the CT element transcription activity (Fig. 4A). By contrast, the RSV minimal promoter reporter was unaffected by overexpression of Cx45 or by oleamide treatment. Furthermore, deletion of the CT element in the –92 to +32 osteocalcin homologous promoter context (–92ΔCT-OCLUC) or mutation of the CT element (–92mtCT-OCLUC) abrogated the sensitivity of the reporter to the overexpression of Cx4"

https://openalex.org/W2040739629,"FAF1 has been introduced as a Fas-binding protein. However, the function of FAF1 in apoptotic execution is not established. Based on the fact that FAF1 is a Fas-binding protein, we asked if FAF1 interacted with other members of the Fas-death-inducing signaling complex (Fas-DISC) such as Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase-8. FAF1 could interact with caspase-8 and FADD in vivo as well as in vitro. The death effector domains (DEDs) of caspase-8 and FADD interacted with the amino acid 181–381 region of FAF1, previously known to have apoptotic potential. Considering that FAF1 directly binds to Fas and caspase-8, FAF1 shows similar protein-interacting characteristics to that of FADD. In the coimmunoprecipitation with an anti-Fas antibody (APO-1) in Jurkat cells, endogenous FAF1 was associated with the precipitates in which caspase-8 was present. By confocal microscopic analysis, both Fas and FAF1 were detected in the cytoplasmic membrane before Fas activation, and in the cytoplasm after Fas activation. FADD and caspase-8 colocalized with Fas in Jurkat cells validating the presence of FAF1 in the authentic Fas-DISC. Overexpression of FAF1 in Jurkat cells caused significant apoptotic death. In addition, the FAF1 deletion mutant lacking the N terminus where Fas, FADD, and caspase-8 interact protected Jurkat cells from Fas-induced apoptosis demonstrating dominant-negative phenotype. Cell death by overexpression of FAF1 was suppressed significantly in both FADD- and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells when compared with that in their parental Jurkat cells. Collectively, our data show that FAF1 is a member of Fas-DISC acting upstream of caspase-8. FAF1 has been introduced as a Fas-binding protein.

In receptor-mediated apoptosis, apoptotic initiation is due to the formation of a protein-signaling complex that involves the physical association of caspases followed by their activation (1Kischkel F.C.

Fas, a member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, has an intracellular death domain (DD) 1The abbreviations used are: DD, death domain; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein; DED, death effector domain; Fas-DISC, Fas-death-inducing signaling complex; FLICE, FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme; FLASH, FLICE-associated huge protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescence protein; CHX, cycloheximide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DEDID, DED-interacting domain; FID, Fas-interacting domain. in its cytoplasmic region (3Ashkenazi A.

The DD is essential for the transduction of apoptotic signal. The Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) binds to the DD of Fas through its DD in the C terminus (7Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E.

In addition to DD, FADD has a DED at its N terminus, another protein interaction module. Therefore, FADD can recruit caspase-8 to the DISC by homotypic interactions between the DEDs of FADD and caspase-8 (2Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 6: 2794-2804Google Scholar, 9Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar). The Fas-DISC formation is the first event that occurs during Fas-initiated cell death signaling. Following Fas-DISC formation, caspase-8 subsequently can be activated by autocleavage leading to the release of the active subunits p18 and p10 (2Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A.

In addition, the activated caspase-8 activates downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 (11Fernandes-Alnemri T. Takahashi A. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Fritz L.

In addition to FADD and caspase-8, another DED-containing protein related to DISC has been reported. Viral FLICE inhibitory protein (v-FLIP) is composed of two DEDs and binds to the Fas·FADD complex and inhibits the recruitment of caspase-8 to Fas-DISC. A human homolog of v-FLIP has many different names c-FLIP, FLAME, I-FLICE, Casper, CASH, usurpin, MRIT, and CLARP, respectively (17Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Arnold E. Varfolomeev E.E.

Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 271-288Google Scholar). FLICE-associated huge protein (FLASH) is another protein with binding activity to the DEDs of caspase-8 and FADD through its DED-like domain and is a component of the Fas-DISC (25Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar). In addition, FLASH enhances the activation of caspase-8 in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Thus, DED-containing proteins seem to modulate the apoptotic process. Two different cell types in Fas signaling pathways have been identified (26Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Google Scholar). Type I cells are characterized by recruitment of caspase-8 to the DISC following Fas activation, leading to direct activation of downstream caspases, including caspase-3 and caspase-7. In type I cells, the blocking of mitochondrial apoptotic function by overexpression of Bcl-2 has no effect on caspase activation. In type II cells, the amount of active caspase-8 generated in the DISC is low. In addition, DISC formation in type II cells is strongly reduced, and overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL blocks caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation. Thus, Fas-mediated apoptosis in type II cells is dependent on mitochondrial activity. FAF1 is a Fas-associating molecule, which enhances Fas-mediated apoptosis (27Chu K. Niu X. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11894-11898Google Scholar). In our previous work, mere intrinsic overexpression of FAF1 initiated apoptosis in the absence of extrinsic death signals in BOSC23 cells (28Ryu S.W. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1027-1032Google Scholar). This apoptotic potential required the region comprising amino acids 181–381 of FAF1. Mouse FAF1 (mFAF1), however, was able to enhance but unable to initiate apoptosis in l-cells (27Chu K. Niu X. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11894-11898Google Scholar). Thus, the apoptotic potential of FAF1 is not clear. The N terminus of FAF1 binds to the DD of Fas even though it does not contain the typical death domain (29Ryu S.W. Chae S.K. Lee K.J. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 388-394Google Scholar). Although FAF1 contains domains found in the proteins of ubiquitination pathway, the function of FAF1 in relation to ubiquitin is largely unknown. FAF1 localizes in the nucleus, the perinuclear cytoplasm, and the nucleoli depending on the cell type (28Ryu S.W. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1027-1032Google Scholar, 30Fröhlich T. Risau W. Flamme I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2353-2363Google Scholar, 31Jensen H.H. Hjerrild M. Guerra B. Larsen M.R. Hojrup P. Boldyreff B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 577-589Google Scholar). FAF1 is not only a binding partner of protein kinase CK2 but also a substrate target for serine residues 289 and 291 (31Jensen H.H. Hjerrild M. Guerra B. Larsen M.R. Hojrup P. Boldyreff B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 577-589Google Scholar, 32Kusk M. Ahmed R. Thomsen B. Bendixen C. Issinger O.G. Boldyreff B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 51-58Google Scholar). Also, the interaction of protein kinase CK2 and FAF1 is enhanced in vivo upon induction of apoptosis (33Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Issinger O.G. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 1117-1126Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that FAF1 is a component of Fas-DISC, and DISC is formed by interaction of the DED-like region (amino acid 181–381 of FAF1) of FAF1 and the DEDs of caspase-8 and FADD. Therefore, this study provides a molecular explanation regarding the proapoptotic role of FAF1 in Fas-mediated signaling. Materials and Reagents—For confocal microscopy, antibodies against FAF1 (M-20), Fas (C-20), FADD (N-18), caspase-8 (N-19), and PARP (F-2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-goat, and TRITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). For Western analysis, antibodies against FADD (A66–2) and caspase-8 (IC12) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), respectively. FAF1 monoclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. J. S. Lim (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Korea). For stimulation of Fas, antibody against Fas (CH-11) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). For immunoprecipitation of DISC, antibody against Fas (APO-1) kindly provided by Dr. P. H. Krammer (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany) was used. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. The glutathione beads and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were purchased from Peptron (Daejeon, Korea) and Qiagen (Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. The protein A/G-agarose beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All restriction enzymes were purchased from TaKaRa Shuzo Co. (Shiga, Japan). Plasmids—Construction of the HA-tagged FADD, GST-fused FAF1, GFP-tagged FAF1, pcDNA3/FAF1, FLAG-tagged FAF1, and FLAG-tagged FAF1-(181–650), which where named to FAF1-ΔFID, was reported previously (28Ryu S.W. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1027-1032Google Scholar, 29Ryu S.W. Chae S.K. Lee K.J. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 388-394Google Scholar, 34Ryu S.W. Chae S.K. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 6-10Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged FAF1-(366–650) was cloned by PCR using FLAG-tagged FAF1 as a template and named to FAF1-ΔFID·DEDID. pcDNA3/FAF1-ΔDEDID was generated by PCR using the pJG4–5/FAF1(s) (29Ryu S.W. Chae S.K. Lee K.J. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 388-394Google Scholar). FAF1(s) is an endogenous isoform of FAF1 with an internal in-frame deletion that overlaps most of the DEDID (FAF1-DEDID corresponds to amino acids 181–381 of FAF1, and amino acids 188–339 of FAF1 is deleted in FAF1(s)). The construction of His-tagged caspase-8 (pET21b/caspase-8) and His-tagged caspase-8C (pET21b/caspase-8C) was reported previously (35Kim I.K. Chung C.W. Woo H.N. Hong G.S. Nagata S. Jung Y.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 311-316Google Scholar). To clone the FAF1 deletion mutants (FAF1-(1–305), FAF1-ΔFID, and FAF1-DEDID) into glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), PCRs with primers containing EcoRI and XhoI linkers were performed using GST-FAF1 full-length cDNA as a template. The pcDNA3/caspase-8 DED construct was generated by PCR using the PET21b/caspase-8 plasmid as a template with primers containing HindIII and BamHI linkers. To subclone the FADD and its deletion mutants (FADD-DD and FADD-DED) into GST fusion vector, PCRs were performed using pcDNA3/FADD plasmid as a template. pcDNA3.1/FADD-DED was kindly provided by Dr. S. H. Kim (Seoul National University, Korea). In Vitro Protein Binding—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Subsequently, cells were sonicated in ice-cold lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The GST fusion proteins were incubated with glutathione-coated beads for 4 h at 4 °C and normalized for protein concentration. The pcDNA3/FAF1, pcDNA3/FADD, pET21b/caspase-8, pET21b/caspase-8C, and pcDNA3/caspase-8 DED were translated in vitro with TnT® Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 2 μg of DNA was incubated with 20 μCi of [35S]methionine in the TnT® Quick Master mix for 90 min at 30 °C. In vitro translated products were mixed with GST-fused proteins bound onto glutathione-coated beads in the binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) and then incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing three times in the lysis buffer, samples were treated with SDS-loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by using a BAS analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Cell Culture—Jurkat cells were all maintained in RPMI 1640 (Jeil Biotechservices Inc., Daegu, Korea), antibiotic-antimycotic (100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B) (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2. For immunoprecipitation assay using anti-FADD antibody (N-18), anti-FAF1 monoclonal antibody, and control antibody, IgG1, (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), 1 × 107 Jurkat cells were cultured and serum-starved with RPMI 1640 medium without fetal bovine serum for 12 h. Cells were harvested at 1 h after 50 ng/ml anti-Fas (CH-11) antibody treatment together with 5 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) and lysed. The antibodies and protein A/G-Sepharose beads were added to the samples and incubated for2hat4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and subjected to either SDS-PAGE or immunoblotting. Western Blotting—Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) using an electrotransporter (OWL, Portsmouth, PA). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mm CaCl2 dihydrate, 0.01% antifoam A, and 5% milk powder. After incubation at 4 °C with anti-FADD (A66–2), anti-FAF1 monoclonal, or anti-caspase-8 (IC12) antibodies, membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mm CaCl2 dihydrate, 0.01% antifoam A, and 5% milk powder. Membranes were incubated with 1:2000 dilutions of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Membrane were washed and developed with ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). DISC Immunoprecipitation—1 × 107 Jurkat cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. After 24 h, the culture medium was exchanged with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing antibiotics and cultured for 12 h. After 12 h, cells were harvested at different times after anti-Fas antibody (50 ng/ml) treatment together with 5 μg/ml CHX and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. As a control, anti-Fas antibody was added to lysates prepared from the unstimulated cells. Lysate protein content was determined by Bradford assay and equalized prior to immunoprecipitation. The anti-Fas (APO-1) and protein A/G-Sepharose beads were added to the samples and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and subjected to either SDS-PAGE or immunoblotting. Cell Death Assay—Jurkat cells were transfected using either LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen, Scotland, UK) or Nucleofactor™ solution provided by using an Amaxa apparatus (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). For using the Amaxa system, 5 × 106 Jurkat cells were harvested, washed once in PBS buffer, and resuspended in 100 μl of specified electroporation buffer. Then, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed, transferred to a cuvette, and nucleofected with an Amaxa Nucleofector™ apparatus. After 30 h, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody for 1 h. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min and mounted on slides using xylene substitute mountant/histomount solution, stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and analyzed by microscopy. For using LipofectAMINE reagent, 5 × 106 cells of three different types of Jurkat cells (A3; parental, I2.1; FADD (–/–), and I9–2; caspase-8 (–/–)) (36Juo P. Woo M.S.A. Kuo C. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804Google Scholar) were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged FAF1 using LipofectAMINE reagent. Cells were fixed and mounted on the slides as above. The percentage of apoptotic cells was analyzed based on the morphological change of cells under a fluorescence microscope. Excitation and emission wavelengths for GFP were 488 and 505 nm, respectively. Existence of GFP-FAF1, caspase-8, and FADD was assessed by immunoblot analysis. Indirect Immunofluorescence—For localization analysis of Fas and FAF1, Jurkat cells with or without stimulation of Fas together with CHX were plated on a poly(A)-lysine-coated coverglass. They were fixed and rinsed with 1× PBS containing 10% normal serum (Sigma). They were incubated with anti-Fas (C-20) or anti-FAF1 (M-20) antibody for 1 h, washed twice with 1× PBS, and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with FITC (Sigma) together with RNase and propidium iodide for 30 min. They were washed three times with 1× PBS and mounted on slides using xylene substitute mountant/histomount solution. For colocalization analysis of FAF1 and Fas-DISC, Jurkat cells with or without stimulation of Fas together with CHX were plated on a poly(A)-lysine-coated coverglass. They were fixed and rinsed with 1× PBS containing 10% normal serum. Cells were incubated with anti-Fas (C-20) antibodies for 1 h, washed twice with 1× PBS, and incubated with secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with FITC for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with 1× PBS. Cells were incubated with anti-FAF1 (M-20), anti-FADD (N-18), anti-caspase-8 (N-19), and anti-PARP (F-2) antibodies for 1 h, respectively, washed twice with 1× PBS, and incubated with each secondary anti-IgG antibodies conjugated with TRITC (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were mounted on slides using xylene substitute mountant/histomount solution. Dual color images were acquired using a Radiance 2000 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). FADD and Caspase-8 Can Interact with FAF1 in Vitro— FAF1 has been introduced as a Fas-binding protein (27Chu K. Niu X. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11894-11898Google Scholar, 29Ryu S.W. Chae S.K. Lee K.J. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 388-394Google Scholar). Therefore, we questioned if FAF1 was a component of the death-inducing signaling complex assembled with Fas (Fas-DISC). We first analyzed the binding pattern of FAF1 with Fas-DISC components. In vitro protein-protein binding assays were carried out by GST-pull-down using GST-fused FAF1, in vitro translated FADD, and caspase-8. As shown in Fig. 1A, in vitro translations of FADD and caspase-8 gave rise to 27- and 55-kDa 35S-labeled proteins, respectively. Also, recombinant GST-FAF1 and GST proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain as 100- and 26-kDa proteins, respectively. In vitro translated FADD and caspase-8 were retained on matrices to which GST-FAF1 had bound but not GST only (Fig. 1A). Thus, interactions between FAF1 and Fas-DISC members were demonstrated in the in vitro binding assay. FAF1 Interacts with FADD and Caspase-8 in Jurkat Cells—To show that FAF1 interacts with FADD and caspase-8 in mammalian cells, endogenous FAF1 and FADD were immunoprecipitated by the anti-FAF1 monoclonal antibody and the anti-FADD (N-18) antibody, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against caspase-8 and FADD, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1B, each Fas-DISC member was detected in the immunoprecipitates, whereas it was not detected in the isotype control, IgG immunoprecipitates. Thus, the interaction of Fas-DISC components and FAF1 was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, and these results show direct association of FAF1 with DISC members. The Apoptotic Effector Domain (Amino Acids 181–381) of FAF1 Binds to the DED Domains of FADD and Caspase-8 — Based on the fact that Fas-DISC complex is formed by interactions between their protein domains, we investigated which FAF1 domains were required for the binding to the Fas-DISC members. To map the binding domains to Fas-DISC proteins, an in vitro binding assay was performed using various deletion constructs (Figs. 1, C–F, and 2A). As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), GST-FAF1-(181–381), corresponding to the previously known apoptotic effector domain (28Ryu S.W. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1027-1032Google Scholar), was sufficient to interact with in vitro translated FADD (Fig. 1C). The in vitro translated FAF1 was sufficient to bind to GST-FADD-DED but not to GST-FADD-DD (Fig. 1D). In binding analysis between FAF1 and caspase-8, GST-FAF1-(181–381) was also mapped as the caspase-8 interacting region (Fig. 1E). Among deletion constructs of caspase-8, the DED of caspase-8 was sufficient to bind to FAF1 but not to the C terminus of caspase-8 where the catalytic activity resides (Fig. 1F). The N terminus (amino acids 1–201) of FAF1 was previously mapped as the binding site of Fas (29Ryu S.W. Chae S.K. Lee K.J. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 388-394Google Scholar). Thus, our data show that FAF1 has Fas- and caspase-8-interacting domains in tandem like FADD. The DED-interacting Domain of FAF1-(181–381) Contains Several Helices—As shown above, the region of amino acids 181–381 of FAF1 was mapped as the interacting domain with the DED domains of FADD and caspase-8 (Figs. 1, C–F, and 2A). Thus, we investigated whether the region of amino acids 181–381 of FAF1 has sequence similarities to the DED domains of FADD and caspase-8. Structure-based alignment analysis of FAF1 revealed that the amino acid similarity of the conventional DED domains to FAF1-(181–381) was not significant (Fig. 2B). In addition, the consensus amino acid residues (RXDL) found in the DEDs (37Kaufmann M. Bozic D. Briand C. Bodmer J.L. Zerbe O. Kohl A. Tschopp J. Grűutter M.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 250-254Google Scholar) were not conserved in FAF1-(181–381). Thus, FAF1-(181–381) is named as DEDID (DED-interacting domain) henceforth. The secondary structure analysis of FAF1-(181–381) with protein data base (www2.protein.Osaka-u.ac.jp) revealed that FAF1-(181–381) might have several helical structures (Fig. 2B). The helical structures of DED domains seemed to be important in the protein-protein interaction (37Kaufmann M. Bozic D. Briand C. Bodmer J.L. Zerbe O. Kohl A. Tschopp J. Grűutter M.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 250-254Google Scholar, 38Weber C.H. Vincenz C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 475-481Google Scholar). FAF1 Is Preassociated with the Fas-DISC before Fas Activation—The DED- or DED-like-domain-containing proteins, including FADD, caspase-8, and FLASH, formed the Fas-DISC through homotypic domain interactions via DEDs. Because FAF1 interacts with Fas-DISC members and has a DEDID, we questioned if FAF1 was a member of Fas-DISC. To determine whether FAF1 is present in the Fas-DISC, Fas-DISCs were immunoprecipitated with an agonistic human antibody against Fas (anti-APO-1 antibody) in Jurkat cells before and after stimulation of Fas with the agonistic anti-Fas monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, endogenous FAF1 was already present in the Fas-DISC before Fas activation but not caspase-8. However, caspase-8 was recruited to the Fas-DISC after Fas activation. In addition, the association of FAF1 with the Fas-DISC was enhanced at 1 h after treatment of Fas antibody and gradually weakened to the resting cell level as apoptosis proceeded. We also observed association of FAF1 with the Fas-DISC in H9 cells (Type 1 cells) as well (data not shown). FAF1 Colocalizes with Fas-DISC to the Cytoplasmic Membrane—It has been previously shown that Fas-DISC is formed in the cytoplasmic membrane via homotypic interactions. Previously, FAF1 has been reported to localize in diverse subcellular positions such as the nucleus, perinuclear cytoplasm, and nucleoli depending on the cell type (28Ryu S.W. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1027-1032Google Scholar, 30Fröhlich T. Risau W. Flamme I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2353-2363Google Scholar, 31Jensen H.H. Hjerrild M. Guerra B. Larsen M.R. Hojrup P. Boldyreff B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 577-589Google Scholar). We found that FAF1 localized to the cytoplasm in NIH3T3, BOSC23, and HeLa cells known to be less sensitive to Fas-DISC-mediated apoptosis (data not shown). By confocal microscopic analysis using the antibodies against endogenous FAF1 and Fas, respectively, both FAF1 and Fas localized in the cytoplasmic membrane in cells that were not treated with anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 4, A and B). Then, the localization of Fas and FAF1 was monitored from 1 to 4 h after Fas treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, clustering of Fas, which agrees with a previous report (39Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Google Scholar), and FAF1 was detected after 1 h of Fas stimulation with anti-Fas antibody. After 2 h, almost all cells showed the diffuse pattern of Fas and FAF1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, A and C). To test whether Fas-DISC and FAF1 colocalize in cells before and after stimulation of Fas with the agonistic anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, analysis of colocalization was performed by confocal microscopy using antibodies against endogenous FAF1, Fas, FADD, and caspase-8 in Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 4 (B and C), endogenous FAF1, FADD, and caspase-8 completely colocalized with Fas in cells treated and not treated with anti-Fas antibody. PARP was detected in the nucleus as expected. FAF1-DEDID Is Essential for the Mediation of Fas-induced Apoptosis—To know if DEDID performs critical functions in the Fas-induced apoptosis, the DEDID deletion mutants were prepared and transiently transfected using Nucleofector™ Solution V provided by Amaxa in Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 5, mere overexpression of both FAF1-ΔDEDID and FAF1-ΔFID·DEDID mutants failed to induce apoptosis, whereas those of FAF1 and FAF1-ΔFID induced apoptosis. In addition, transfection of FAF1-ΔFID in which Fas interacting region is deleted inhibited Fas-mediated apoptosis significantly as expected. Moreover, transfection of FAF1-ΔDEDID and FAF1-ΔFID·DEDID, respectively, inhibited Fas-mediated apoptosis significantly as well. These data suggest that DEDID deletion mutants act as dominant negatives in the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the DEDID is essential in mediating Fas-induced apoptosis. Effect of FAF1 in FADD- and Caspase-8-deficient Jurkat Cells—FADD and caspase-8 are necessary for Fas receptor-mediated cell death. We therefore evaluated the requirement of caspase-8 and FADD for FAF1-induced cell death. To this end, GFP-tagged FAF1 was transiently transfected by LipofectAMINE reagent in parental Jurkat cells (A3), FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (I2.1), and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells (I9–2). As shown in Fig. 6A, transient transfection of the GFP-tagged FAF1 in parental Jurkat cells (52 ± 6%) efficiently induced morphological changes, consistent with apoptosis, when compared with that in vector-transfected parental Jurkat cells (5 ± 0.8%). However, as compared with results in FAF1-transfected parental Jurkat cells, cell death by FAF1 in either FADD-deficient (19 ± 3%) or caspase-8-deficient (24 ± 4%) cells was significantly suppressed. In all experiments, GFP vector itself induced only slight apoptosis (<5%). The ability of FAF1 to induce full-blown apoptosis required FADD and caspase-8. The fact that overexpression of FAF1 still induced a significant extent of apoptosis (19–24%) in FADD- and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells suggests that FAF1 might have another mechanism of cell death besides the Fas-DISC-mediated apoptosis. This study enrolls FAF1 as a member of Fas-DISC together with FADD and caspase-8. FAF1 interacts with the DED domains of FADD and caspase-8 through a potentially helix-rich DED-like domain, DEDID, of FAF1 previously known to have an apoptotic potential. In addition, FAF1 mutants lacking DEDID inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis in a dominant-negative fashion emphasizing the essentiality of DEDID in Fas-induced apoptosis. By confocal microscopic analysis, we demonstrated that FAF1 as well as FADD and caspase-8 completely colocalized with Fas in Jurkat cells. We also show that caspase-8 functions downstream of FAF1, because significant inhibition of apoptotic induction by FAF1 occurred in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells. FAF1 interacts with caspase-8 and FADD. The interaction occurs among the DEDID of FAF1 and the DEDs of caspase-8 and of FADD. Apoptotic signal transmissions via homotypic interaction domains such as death domain, death effector domain, caspase recruitment domain, and DED-recruiting domain have been reported (40Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Google Scholar). Most of the caspase-8-interacting proteins interact via their DED motifs (21Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Google Scholar, 40Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1172-1176Google Scholar, 42Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Google Scholar). However, death effector domain-associated factor and FLASH interact with DED proteins without having a DED (25Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar, 43Zheng L. Schickling O. Peter M.E. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31945-31952Google Scholar). Likewise, FAF1 here is presented as another example of a protein interacting with the DEDs of caspase-8 and FADD without having a typical DED. The DED has a structure composed of six highly conserved α-helices. Even if FAF1 does not show significant homology with DED by amino acid sequence analysis, the DEDID of FAF1 has several potential α-helices when analyzed by the protein data base (www2.protein.Osakau.ac.jp) like DEDs. Thus, crystal structural analysis of DEDID of FAF1 would be able to provide information regarding its relevance to DED or DED-like domains. Recently, FLASH has been reported as a member of Fas-DISC (25Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar). FLASH contains a DED-recruitment domain that interacts with the DED domains of caspase-8 and FADD, and FLASH is involved in association of FADD and caspase-8 upon Fas stimulation. However, FLASH does not interact with either full-length Fas or its death domain. Unlike FLASH, FAF1 directly interacts with Fas-DD as well as FADD- and caspase-8-DEDs. FAF1 is much bigger than FADD even though they have similar protein-interacting characteristics. Thus, it is conceivable that FAF1 might play a role as a scaffolding protein that tethers Fas/FADD/caspase-8 signaling modules. Further studies of the interaction profile of FAF1 with other Fas-DISC members such as FLASH will provide us information of the putative role of FAF1 as a scaffold. Two different mechanisms exist regarding formation of Fas-DISC (26Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Google Scholar). In type I cells, Fas-DISC is preformed without Fas activation and enhanced by Fas activation. In type II cells, the DISC is formed upon Fas activation. Thus, Fas-mediated apoptosis rapidly progresses in type I cells (25Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar, 26Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Google Scholar). FLASH is only recruited to Fas upon Fas activation in both type I and II cells (25Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that FAF1 was already interacting with Fas before Fas activation in both type I (data not shown) and type II cells. In addition, the association of FAF1 with Fas was enhanced during cell death signaling upon Fas activation. Thus, these results suggest that FAF1 might serve as an early seed for the fast formation of DISC. Interaction of FADD and caspase-8 has been reported to occur through homophilic interaction between the DEDs of FADD and caspase-8 (2Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 6: 2794-2804Google Scholar, 9Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar). The FADD mutant, lacking N-terminal amino acids 1–79 (DED), functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of Fas- and tumor necrosis factor-mediated apoptosis. In this study, FAF1-ΔDEDID lacking caspase-8 binding domain functioned similarly. The dominant-negative effect of FAF1-ΔDEDID on Fas-induced cell death testifies to the essentiality of DEDID in mediating Fas-induced cell death. FAF1-ΔDEDID corresponds to the FAF1(s), an endogenous short isoform FAF1 in which most of DEDID is deleted (29Ryu S.W. Chae S.K. Lee K.J. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 388-394Google Scholar). The cDNAs of FAF1(s) have been found both in the human liver and in the HeLa cell cDNA libraries even though the protein has not yet been detected by Western analysis. Thus, FAF1(s), if translated, would be able to function as an endogenous inhibitor against FAF1 in Fas-induced apoptosis. The FID of FAF1 interacts with Fas (29Ryu S.W. Chae S.K. Lee K.J. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 388-394Google Scholar), and the DEDID of FAF1 interacts with the DED of caspase-8. In this respect, FAF1 is similar to the adapter protein FADD. Moreover, both FAF1 and FADD have their interacting modules in tandem. It is conceivable that FAF1 exists in Fas-DISC to amplify the aggregation of caspase-8 via a FADD-like mechanism. We expect a cooperative relationship between FADD and FAF1 in the formation of Fas-DISC, because diminution of apoptosis by FAF1 occurred in FADD-deficient Jurkat cells. We thank Dr. P. H. Krammer for kindly donating anti-APO-1 antibody and Dr. J. Blenis (Harvard Medical School) for kindly providing caspase-8- and FADD-deficient Jurkat cells. We are grateful to Dr. R. J. Youle (National Institutes of Health) for a critical reading of the manuscript."

Using data gathered on board the Mir space station during the Sileye-2 experiment1, we show here that there are two separate components of cosmic rays that cause these flashes: one due to heavy nuclei and one due to protons. This indicates that perception by an astronaut's visual apparatus could involve two complementary mechanisms."

In eukaryotes, the processing and export of mRNA from the nuclear transcription site to the cytoplasm require a large number of proteins, a fraction of which act cotranscriptionally.

Thus, capping enzymes access the 5′-end of nascent mRNAs via the pol II C-terminal domain; splicing occurs cotranscriptionally in association with the transcription elongation complex via the pol II C-terminal domain (3Mortillaro M.J. Blencowe B.J. Wei X. Nakayasu H. Du L. Warren S.L. Sharp P.A. Berezney R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8253-8257Google Scholar, 4Steinmetz E.J.

Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Google Scholar). The connection between transcription and mRNA metabolism is supported by the accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNAs in mutants with a truncated pol II C-terminal domain (8Misteli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 697-705Google Scholar) or the retention at the site of transcription of human β-globin pre-mRNAs defective in either splicing or 3′-end formation (9Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Geraghty F. Pereira H.S. Grosveld F. Antoniou M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2855-2866Google Scholar). This connection is also extended to mRNA export. The mRNA is not exported from the nucleus unless the transcript has been properly processed (10Zenklusen D. Stutz F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 150-156Google Scholar).Nuclear mRNA export seems to be connected to transcription at both functional and physical levels. It has been shown that hyperadenylated transcripts accumulate at the site of transcription after different mRNA export blockages (11Jensen T.H. Patricio K. McCarthy T. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 887-898Google Scholar). Importantly, a conserved TREX complex that contains Sub2p/UAP56, Yra1p/ALY, Tex1p, and the THO complex has been identified in yeast and humans (12Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Google Scholar). Yra1p/ALY and Sub2p/UAP56 are both involved in mRNA nuclear export (13Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Google Scholar). THO was previously identified as a four protein-containing complex involved in transcription elongation and the maintenance of genome stability (14Chávez S. Beilharz T. Rondón A.G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Lithgow T. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5824-5834Google Scholar). Yeast mutations in any of the four genes encoding the THO complex (THO2, HPR1, MFT1, and THP2) confer transcription elongation defects and a strong hyper-recombination phenotype that is transcription-dependent (14Chávez S. Beilharz T. Rondón A.G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Lithgow T. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5824-5834Google Scholar, 15Chávez S. Aguilera A.

Functional analysis of sub2 and yra1 mutants as well as mex67 and mtr2 mutants, defective in the Mtr2p-Mex67p essential heterodimeric mRNA export factor (17Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Pante N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Google Scholar, 18Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Luhrmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Google Scholar), revealed that they have defective transcription and high levels of transcription-dependent direct-repeat recombination (19Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Google Scholar). All these factors represent a subset of conserved eukaryotic proteins involved in mature mRNA biogenesis and processing steps that are important for efficient transcription. Regardless of the specific function of these factors along the different steps of mRNA metabolism from 5′-end capping to 3′-end cleavage, poly(A)+ addition, and export, failure to perform appropriately any of these steps may affect the other steps, leading to nuclear mRNA accumulation and transcription impairment and causing transcription-associated hyper-recombination.In a recent search for yeast mutants with high levels of genetic instability, we identified THP1, a gene conserved in eukaryotes whose null mutations confer the same transcription defect and hyper-recombination phenotype as those of THO mutants (20Gallardo M. Aguilera A. Genetics. 2001; 157: 79-89Google Scholar). To gain new insight into Thp1p function, we undertook two experimental approaches. First, in a search for multicopy suppressors of the gene expression defect of thp1Δ, we identified NAB2, a gene encoding an hnRNP that specifically associates with nuclear poly(A)+ RNA in vivo (21Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Google Scholar) and is required for poly(A) tail length control and nuclear RNA export (22Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B.

Swanson M.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1800-1810Google Scholar). Second, we purified the Thp1p-Sac3p complex, which has also been purified in a parallel study (24Fischer T. Strasser K. Racz A. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Oppizzi M. Ihrig P. Lechner J. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5843-5852Google Scholar); characterized it for the presence of components of the THO/TREX complex; and determined whether Thp1p-Sac3p acts as a functional unit in mRNP metabolism. Sac3p was first identified as an actin suppressor (25Novick P. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1989; 121: 659-674Google Scholar) and has been shown to be involved in nuclear protein export (26Jones A.L. Quimby B.B. Hood J.K. Ferrigno P. Keshava P.H. Silver P.A. Corbett A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3224-3229Google Scholar) and recently in RNA export (24Fischer T. Strasser K. Racz A. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Oppizzi M. Ihrig P. Lechner J. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5843-5852Google Scholar, 27Lei E.P. Stern C.A. Fahrenkrog B. Krebber H. Moy T.I. Aebi U. Silver P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 836-847Google Scholar). We show by genetic and molecular analyses that sac3Δ and nab2-1 strains have transcription and hyper-recombination phenotypes similar to those of thp1Δ. In addition, we show that purified His6-Thp1p from Escherichia coli binds RNA in vitro. We conclude that Nab2p and Thp1p-Sac3p are functionally related hnRNP-like factors that act in the same process as THO/TREX and Mtr2p-Mex67p in mRNP metabolism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains—We used the wild-type (W303-1A), hpr1Δ::HIS3 (U678-1C), tho2Δ::KAN (RK2-6C) (16Piruat J.I.

Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Google Scholar) strains that have been reported previously. Strain LSY267 (pep4Δ) (28Symington L.S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 987-996Google Scholar) isogenic to W303-1A was used for protein complex purification. Mutant nab2-1 (22Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol.

The sac3Δ::KAN (Y03517) and thp1Δ::KAN (Y01764) strains were obtained from EUROSCARF (Frankfurt, Germany). Isogenic derivatives were obtained by genetic crosses. These include wild-type strains SAY3-2B, NAL-3A, and NAL-3B and mutant strains SAY3-2A (sac3Δ) and NAL-11B and NAL-5B (nab2-1). All comparative analyses were performed with mutants and their isogenic wild-type strains on either the W303 (R. Rothstein) or BY4741 (EUROSCARF) genetic background, with the exception of nab2-1, for which we used its own genetic background (22Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7752-7760Google Scholar).Plasmids—Plasmids p416-GAL1-lacZ and pSCh202 (15Chávez S. Aguilera A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2826-2835Google Scholar), but in vector pRS316. For the isolation of multicopy suppressors of thp1Δ, we used the pCM184-LAUR plasmid (19Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Google Scholar). We used MW90 constructed in YEp351 as a yeast multicopy library (30Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Jank B. Teply R. Wiesenberger G. Schweyen R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 301-306Google Scholar).For the purification of Thp1p from E. coli, we constructed plasmid pT7-HA-THP1 containing an N-terminal His6-HA-Thp1p translational fusion under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. For this purpose, the HA-THP1 fragment was obtained by PCR using primers GATATCATCGATCTCGAGTCACCAAAGAACGTGAG and GGATCCTCTAGAGCTAGCTATCCCTATGACGTTCCCTCTCACGTTTTGTGGTCCATGGAAAAGAGAAG and subcloned into the NheI-ClaI site of plasmid pT7-7-His6 (31Clever B. Intherthal H. Schmuckli-Maurer J. King J. Sigrist M. Heyer W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2535-2544Google Scholar).Purification of His6-HA-Thp1p from E. coli—E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with plasmid pT7-HA-THP1 was grown in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin up to A600 = 0.8. Expression was induced for 4 h by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl, pH 8) containing 10 mm imidazole. His6-HA-Thp1 was partially purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (QIAGEN Inc.) in buffer A containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (20 and 250 mm).Thp1p-Sac3p Complex Purification and Western Analyses—The Thp1p-Sac3p complex was purified using a C-terminally TAP-tagged Thp1 protein constructed for this study. For this, we replaced the wild-type copy of THP1 with the THP1-TAP fusion obtained by PCR with primers GTTAATGAACGAATCACCAAGATGTTTCCTGCCCATTCTCACGTTTTGTGGTCCATGGAAAAGAGAAG and CAGCATAATGTCGCTCCTTCTCTTCTATTTCCTATATATATCTACGACTCACTATAGGG in wild-type strain LSY267. Purified TAP-tagged proteins were purified essentially as described (32Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar) with modifications as published (19Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Google Scholar). Purified complexes were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nylon membranes. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk, proteins were detected using antibodies against Mft1p and Sub2p and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Blots were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence reactions (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Protein Identification—Gel-resolved proteins were digested with trypsin and partially fractionated, and the resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization reflectron time-of-flight (MALDI-reTOF) mass spectrometry (Reflex III, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) as described (33Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Lacomis L. Grewal A. Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Tempst P. J. Chromatogr. A. 1998; 826: 167-181Google Scholar) and also using an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry instrument (API300, ABI/MDS Sciex, Thornhill, Canada) modified with an ultrafine ionization source (34Geromanos S. Frecklenton G. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 777-790Google Scholar). Selected masses from the MALDI-reTOF spectra were taken to search the yeast segment of a protein non-redundant data base. Tandem mass spectra were inspected for y″ ion series to compare with the computer-generated fragment ion series of the predicted tryptic peptides.mRNA Export Assays—In situ mRNA localization assays were performed as described (35Amberg D.C. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1173-1189Google Scholar) using digoxigenin-labeled oligo(dT)16.In Vitro RNA and DNA Binding Assays—In vitro RNA and DNA band shifting assays were performed following the procedures described previously (19Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Google Scholar) using identical RNA and DNA probes.Miscellaneous—Recombination frequencies were obtained from two to three different transformants for each genotype. They were determined as the median frequency of 6–12 independent values for each transformant as reported previously (29Prado F. Piruat J.I. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2826-2835Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays and Northern analyses were performed according to previously published procedures (15Chávez S. Aguilera A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3459-3470Google Scholar).RESULTSMulticopy NAB2 Suppresses the Gene Expression Defect of thp1Δ—To obtain new insights into the functional role of Thp1p, we searched for genes that could potentially have an overlapping function with Thp1p. For this, we used our newly developed genetic assays for the analysis of gene expression based on plasmid pCM184-LAUR carrying a 4.15-kb lacZ-URA3 translational fusion under the control of the Ptet promoter (Fig. 1A) (19Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Google Scholar). We have previously reported that thp1Δ mutants are defective in transcription of the lacZ sequence (20Gallardo M. Aguilera A. Genetics. 2001; 157: 79-89Google Scholar). Here, we first showed that, as expected, thp1Δ mutants containing the LAUR expression system were unable to form colonies on synthetic complete medium without uracil (SC–Ura) and showed reduced levels of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1B) (data not shown).From ∼80,000 thp1Δ transformants with the multicopy library MW90 (30Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Jank B. Teply R. Wiesenberger G. Schweyen R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 301-306Google Scholar) plated on SC–Ura, we selected one that recovered the capacity to grow in the absence of uracil. Isolation and restriction and sequencing analysis of the plasmid (YEp351-1.9) carried by this transformant revealed a 6.5-kb insert of the NAB2 region covering three complete open reading frames. Complementation analysis of deletion derivative versions of the original plasmid indicated that the ability of this plasmid to suppress the gene expression defect of thp1Δ was abolished only if NAB2, but not the other two open reading frames, was deleted (data not shown). Subcloning of the NAB2 open reading frame into YEp351 confirmed that multicopy NAB2, and not the adjacent genes of the original insert, suppressed the inability of thp1Δ cells to express the lacZ-URA3 fusion as determined by growth on SC–Ura and by Northern analysis (Fig. 1, B and C). This suppression was specific to thp1Δ, and not to other mutants with the thp1-like phenotype such as hpr1Δ and tho2Δ (Fig. 1B). Quantification of mRNA levels showed that suppression of the transcription defect of thp1Δ cells was partial. Multicopy NAB2 made thp1Δ cells reach 11.6% of the wild-type levels of lacZ-URA3 expression.Finally, recombination analyses of the chromosomal direct-repeat system leu2-k::ADE2-URA3::leu2-k showed that multicopy NAB2 reduced recombination in a thp1Δ background to levels (1.1 × 10–1) 1.5-fold below thp1 levels (7.1 × 10–2). These results indicate that suppression of thp1Δ by NAB2 overexpression is partial. It is detectable at the transcriptional level, but it is not enough to yield a significant effect on direct-repeat recombination.Multicopy NAB2 Partially Suppresses the mRNA Export Defect of thp1Δ Mutants—Given the phenotypic similarity of thp1Δ mutants to mRNA export mutants and THO/TREX mutants (12Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Google Scholar, 19Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Google Scholar), we first showed, by in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled oligo(dT) and fluorescein-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody, that Thp1p was also required for proper mRNA nuclear export at both 30 and 37 °C (Fig. 1D) (data not shown). This is agreement with recently reported data from a parallel study (24Fischer T. Strasser K. Racz A. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Oppizzi M. Ihrig P. Lechner J. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5843-5852Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, we observed that thp1Δ mex67-5 and sac3Δ mex67-5 double mutants were also inviable (data not shown), a phenotype previously observed for mutants that accumulate mRNA in the nucleus (18Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Luhrmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Google Scholar, 19Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Google Scholar, 36Strasser K. Bassler J. Hurt E. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Google Scholar).Nab2p is a major nuclear protein associated with nuclear poly(A)+ RNA (21Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Google Scholar) required for nuclear mRNA export (22Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7752-7760Google Scholar, 23Hector R.E. Nykamp K.R. Dheur S. Anderson J.T. Non P.J. Urbinati C.R. Wilson S.M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Swanson M.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1800-1810Google Scholar). As the transcription defect of thp1Δ was accompanied by mRNA accumulation in the nucleus, we assayed whether this phenotype was also suppressed by multicopy NAB2. As shown in Fig. 1D, thp1Δ cells carrying multicopy NAB2 showed significantly lower nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA compared with thp1Δ cells, even though some nuclear mRNA accumulation could still be observed after 4 h of shifting cells to 37 °C. These results confirm that thp1Δ is suppressed by multicopy NAB2, but only at partial levels, and that the gene expression and mRNA export phenotypes are linked.nab2-1 Strains Are Defective in lacZ Transcription and Stimulate Direct-repeat Recombination—As our results showing that multicopy NAB2 suppresses thp1Δ suggest that the function of Nab2p might be related to that of Thp1p, we investigated whether nab2 mutants also show expression and recombination phenotypes similar to the those of thp1Δ mutants. Because NAB2 is an essential gene, we used nab2-1 for our studies. This mutation is leaky at 30 °C, and it was previously shown that nab2-1 strains accumulate mRNA in the nucleus at this temperature (22Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7752-7760Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, nab2-1 reduced β-galactosidase activity to 20% of the wild-type levels. Kinetic analyses of transcription of the GAL1pr::lacZ and GAL1pr::PHO5 fusion constructs revealed that lacZ mRNA accumulated at a much slower rate than the wild-type strains, whereas only a small difference was found for PHO5. As shown for thp1Δ, this implies that the main transcription step impaired in nab2-1 mutants is transcription through lacZ, and not activation of the GAL1 promoter. Next, we determined the effect of nab2-1 on recombination between direct repeats. For this, we constructed nab2-1 strains carrying the chromosomal direct-repeat system leu2-k::ADE2-URA3::leu2-k containing two 2.16-kb repeat units. Recombination between the leu2-k repeats was scored in this system as deletions that lose the ADE2-URA3 intervening sequence plus one leu2-k copy. The frequency of deletions of nab2-1 strains was 25-fold above wild-type levels (Fig. 2B). The intensity of the phenotypes of nab2-1 was weaker than that of the phenotypes of thp1Δ, but this may be due to the leaky activity of the nab2-1 allele (22Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7752-7760Google Scholar). To conclude, nab2-1 shows a transcription defect and hyper-recombination phenotype similar to those of thp1Δ, although to a lesser degree.Fig. 2Expression analysis of GAL1pr::lacZ and GAL1pr::PHO5 constructs in nab2-1 mutants.A: upper panels, β-galactosidase and acid phosphatase activities of the wild-type (WT; NAL-3A) and nab2-1 (NAL-11B) strains transformed with plasmids p416-GAL1-lacZ and pSCh202. Each value represents the average of two to three different transformants. Only the data of induced expression (2% galactose) are given. Under repression conditions (2% glucose), values were below detection levels in all cases. Lower panels, Northern analysis of lacZ and PHO5 mRNAs driven by the GAL1 promoter. Mid-log phase cells transformed with plasmid p416-GAL1-lacZ or pSCh202 were diluted in 3% glycerol- and 2% lactate-containing SC–Ura to A600 = 0.5 and incubated for 16 h at 30 °C. Galactose was then added, and samples were taken at different times as indicated. The 0.9-kb PHO5 EcoRV internal fragment was used as the PHO5 probe. For other details, see the legend to Fig. 1. B: recombination frequencies of the chromosomal direct-repeat system leu2-k::URA3-ADE2::leu2-k in the wild-type (NAL-3B) and nab2-1 (NAL-5B) strains. All experiments were performed at 30 °C.

A.U., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)mRNA Degradation Rates Are Unaffected in thp1Δ Mutants—The observation that transcription driven by the same promoter is defective in thp1Δ cells for some DNA sequences (i.e. lacZ), but not for others (i.e. PHO5), indicates that the transcription defect occurs at a post-initiation step (20Gallardo M. Aguilera A. Genetics. 2001; 157: 79-89Google Scholar). The fact that hyper-recombination of thp1Δ cells is linked to transcription elongation is good evidence that these mutants have a transcription defect responsible for hyper-recombination. Nevertheless, to confirm that the lower rate of mRNA formation observed in time course kinetic experiments is not due to high rates of mRNA decay caused by thp1Δ, we determined the degradation rate of two mRNAs, GAL1 and lacZ, driven by the same regulated GAL1 promoter. For this, we first allowed cells to accumulate mRNA in 2% galactose. After repressing transcription by shifting cells to 2% glucose, the kinetics of degradation of the accumulated mRNA was determined in time course experiments. Whereas thp1Δ strains formed the GAL1 mRNA at half the wild-type rate (20Gallardo M. Aguilera A. Genetics. 2001; 157: 79-89Google Scholar), Fig. 3 shows that the rate of degradation of this mRNA was not higher in thp1Δ versus wild-type cells (half-lives of 17 and 12 min, respectively). Also, whereas thp1Δ cells, in contrast to wild-type cells, did not form detectable lacZ mRNA after3hof transcription activation (20Gallardo M. Aguilera A. Genetics. 2001; 157: 79-89Google Scholar), Fig. 3 shows that the rate of lacZ mRNA degradation was not higher in thp1Δ versus wild-type cells (half-lives of 7.5 and 4.5 min, respectively). We can therefore conclude that the strong defect in the kinetics of mRNA formation of thp1Δ cells is caused by defective transcription, and not by increased mRNA degradation.Fig. 3Kinetics of degradation of GAL1 and lacZ mRNAs in thp1Δ mutants. Shown are the results from Northern analysis of the mRNA decay of the endogenous GAL1 mRNA and the lacZ mRNA driven by the GAL1 promoter in cells transformed with p416-GAL1-lacZ. Mid-log phase wild-type (WT; W303-1A) and thp1Δ (WFBE046) cells grown in 2% galactose-containing SC medium either for 3 h (GAL1) or overnight (lacZ) were transferred to 2% glucose-containing SC medium before samples were taken at the indicated times. The 0.75-kb GAL1 PvuII-AvaI internal fragment, the 3-kb lacZ BamHI-BglII fragment, and the 589-bp 25 S rRNA internal fragment obtained by PCR were used as 32P-labeled DNA probes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Thp1p Binds RNA in Vitro—Because null mutants of THP1 show phenotypes similar to those of mutants of the THO/TREX complex, Nab2p, and mRNA export factors Mtr2p and Mex67p, all of which bind RNA (17Santos-Rosa H.

Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Google Scholar), we investigated whether Thp1p associates with either RNA or DNA in vitro. We first purified His6-Thp1p from E. coli. RNA band shifting assays using a 90-nucleotide long RNA molecule showed that Thp1p bound RNA (Fig. 4A). Binding was directly proportional to the amounts of Thp1p used. No binding activity was observed with the negative control, i.e. purified material obtained from E. coli transformed with the empty vector pT7-7-His6. The ability to bind RNA is not conferred by the His6 tail because we have shown that other His6-tagged proteins did not bind RNA in our assays. 2A. G. Rondón and A. Aguilera, unpublished data.

https://openalex.org/W1974140734,"By using the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) as a paradigm for cells that undergo long term re-programming of NF-κB-dependent transcription, we have determined a novel mechanism by which mammalian cells establish their basal NF-κB activity. Elevation of NF-κB activity during HSC activation is accompanied by induction of CBF1 expression and DNA binding activity. We show that the transcriptional repressor CBF1 interacts with a dual NF-κB/CBF1-binding site (κB2) in the IκBα promoter. Nucleotide substitutions that disrupt CBF1 binding to the κB2 site result in an elevation of IκBα promoter activity and loss of responsiveness of the promoter to a transfected CBF1 reporter vector. Overexpression of CBF1 in COS1 cells was associated with markedly reduced IκBα protein expression and elevated NF-κB DNA binding activity. CBF1-induced repression of IκBα promoter activity was reversed in HSC transfected with the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD). The ability of NICD to enhance IκBα gene transcription was confirmed in COS1 cells and was found to be dependent on an intact RAM domain of NICD that has been shown previously to help mediate the interaction of NICD with CBF1. One of the mechanisms by which NICD is thought to convert CBF1 into an activator of transcription is via the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators/histone acetylases to gene promoters. Co-transfection of HSC with NICD and p53 caused a diminution of IκBα promoter activity, by contrast overexpression of p300 enhanced IκBα promoter function. Taken together, these data suggest that basal IκBα expression (and as a consequence NF-κB activity) is under the control of the various components of the CBF1/Notch signal transduction pathway.

Taken together, these data suggest that basal IκBα expression (and as a consequence NF-κB activity) is under the control of the various components of the CBF1/Notch signal transduction pathway. The transcription factor NF-κB is a key regulator of the growth, differentiation, and fate of mammalian cells (1Ghosh S. May J.M. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar). In its active form NF-κB is found in the nucleus as either a heterodimer or a homodimer composed of five different members of the Rel family of proteins (p65, p50, p52, c-Rel, and RelB) (1Ghosh S. May J.M. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar). Active NF-κB can bind to its target DNA sequence (GGGRNNYYCC) and activate the transcription of a vast number and wide range of genes (2Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Google Scholar). Given the importance of NF-κB as a regulator of cell function, it is essential that its transcriptional activity is subject to exquisite control mechanisms. Most cells only express low levels of basal nuclear NF-κB activity, with the majority of Rel dimers being sequestered in the cytoplasm in a complex with an inhibitory IκB protein. The three most important IκB proteins, IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ, inhibit NF-κB function by masking nuclear localization and DNA binding signals (1Ghosh S. May J.M. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar, 3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). These inhibitors are pivotal regulators of NF-κB-dependent gene expression as they can be degraded in response to a wide variety of epigenetic stimulators and in doing so release active NF-κB which can then translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription (3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). Perturbation of IκB control of NF-κB has been associated with many pathological conditions including chronic inflammatory diseases, persistence of viral infections, and cancer (4Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 135-142Google Scholar, 5Takk P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Google Scholar, 6Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Google Scholar, 7Hiskott J. Kwon H. Genin P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 143-151Google Scholar). Therefore, there is currently considerable interest in the study of the signal transduction mechanisms that operate to regulate the expression, stability, and function of the IκB proteins. By far the most well understood NF-κB signal transduction pathway is that which leads to the degradation of the best characterized IκB protein, IκBα (3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). Following the stimulation of cells by activating agents such as proinflammatory cytokines, mitogens, and viral proteins, IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated at two serine residues (Ser-32 and Ser-36) by the recently discovered IκB kinase complex (3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar, 8Israel A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Google Scholar, 9Ben-Neriah Y. Nat. Immun. 2000; 3: 20-26Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκBα is then a substrate for ubiquitin ligases that catalyze the addition of ubiquitin groups to IκBα; this modification then targets IκBα for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). Degradation of IκBα releases active NF-κB; however, this activation is only short lived as NF-κB stimulates transcription of the IκBα gene leading to a rapid replenishment of the inhibitor (10Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 15: 2532-2536Google Scholar, 11Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Google Scholar, 12Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Google Scholar, 13Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Google Scholar). The newly synthesized IκBα enters the nucleus where it binds to NF-κB dimers leading to their dissociation from DNA and return to the cytoplasm (14Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Google Scholar). The end result is a replenishment of the cytoplasmic pool of inducible NF-κB and diminution of NF-κB-dependent transcription back to its basal state. The classical transient NF-κB activation pathway operates in many cell types to generate a rapid but short lived burst of NF-κB activity that enables the cell to mount an appropriate response to changes in its microenvironment. However, it is also apparent that levels of basal NF-κB activity can differ greatly between different cell types. These differences presumably reflect the individual cellular requirements for NF-κB-dependent gene expression. For example, although many mammalian cells express low levels of active NF-κB, other cell types such as B cells, thymocytes, macrophages, neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, and cultured proliferating smooth muscle cells have been found to express relatively high basal levels of NF-κB (15Kaltschmidt C.

Mondal K. Andreesen R. Krause S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 99-105Google Scholar, 23Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Google Scholar, 24Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Curr.

Immunol. 1997; 9: 1581-1588Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate basal NF-κB activity in cells are relatively poorly understood. One mechanism has been documented in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells that undergo a persistent activation of NF-κB (27Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Google Scholar). In these cells a hypophosphorylated form of IκBβ is expressed which binds Rel dimers in such a way that nuclear localization and DNA binding are not impeded. As interactions between IκBβ or IκBα with NF-κB are mutually exclusive, hypophosphorylated IκBβ functions as a chaperone protecting the active transcription factor from inhibition by IκBα (27Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Google Scholar). Other mechanisms for long term elevation of NF-κB activity have been documented in Reed-Steenberg cells of Hodgkin's lymphoma. These cells have been reported to exhibit reduced expression of IκBα, which either results from amino acid mutations that reduce stability of the IκBα protein or from higher constitutive IκB kinase activity (28Krappmann D. Emmerich F. Kordes U. Scharschmidt E. Dorken B. Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 943-953Google Scholar, 29Emmerich F. Meiser M. Hummel M. Demel G. Foss H.D. Jundt F. Mathas S. Krappmann D.

Med. 2000; 191: 395-402Google Scholar). Despite these examples, little is understood about the signaling mechanisms that regulate basal NF-κB activity in the majority of differentiated mammalian cells. We have reported previously (31Elsharkawy A. Wright M.C. Hay R.T. Arthur M.J.P. Hughes T. Bahr M.J. Degitz K. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 761-769Google Scholar, 32Wright M.C. Issa R. Smart D.E.

Activated HSC are the major source of the excess extracellular matrix proteins that ultimately distort the normal architecture and function of the liver in individuals suffering from a wide range of chronic liver diseases (33Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Google Scholar). In addition, activated HSC express an impressive array of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors, many of which are regulated at the level of gene transcription by NF-κB(e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and ICAM1) (34Maher J.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 417-426Google Scholar, 35Mann D.A. Smart D.E. Gut. 2002; 50: 891-896Google Scholar). NF-κB has also been shown to be protective against cytokine-induced HSC apoptosis (36Lang A. Schoonhovan R. Tuvia S. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. J. Hepatol. 2000; 33: 49-58Google Scholar). Given the strong pro-inflammatory milieu of the activated HSC, its elevated expression of active NF-κB is therefore likely to be an important regulator of cell survival and in turn the persistence and progression of liver fibrosis. We noticed that the re-programming of basal NF-κB activity during culture-induced activation of primary rat HSC (a widely accepted model for in vivo HSC activation) was associated with dramatically reduced expression of cytoplasmic and nuclear IκBα (31Elsharkawy A. Wright M.C. Hay R.T. Arthur M.J.P. Hughes T. Bahr M.J. Degitz K. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 761-769Google Scholar). We reasoned that this diminution of IκBα during HSC activation may be one way in which the cell re-programs its basal NF-κB activity. Moreover, we were interested in the possibility that culture-induced activation of primary HSC may provide a model system in which to discover the mechanisms by which cells program their constitutive levels of active NF-κB. In this study we provide evidence that HSC activation is associated with induced expression of the ubiquitously expressed transcriptional repressor RBP-J (hereafter termed CBF1), which is able to bind to a subset of NF-κB sites that overlap with consensus CBF1-binding sites (37Kannabiran C. Zeng X. Vales L.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1-9Google Scholar, 38Oswald F. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2077-2088Google Scholar, 39Palmieri M. Sasso M.P. Monese R.

We have mapped an overlapping NF-κB/CBF1-binding site (κB2 site) in the human IκBα promoter and have shown that overexpression of CBF1 resulted in a profound repression of IκBα gene transcription and protein expression. We demonstrate that this effect requires direct interaction of CBF1 with the κB2 site and results in an elevation of NF-κB activity. We also show that the intracellular domain of Notch1 can de-repress IκBα gene transcription and protein expression via a CBF1-dependent mechanism that operates synergistically with the transcriptional co-activator p300. These findings provide novel IκB kinase-independent mechanisms by which cells regulate NF-κB activity. Cell Culture—COS1 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). HSC were isolated from normal livers of 350-g Sprague-Dawley rats by sequential perfusion with collagenase and Pronase, followed by discontinuous density centrifugation in 11.5% Optiprep (Invitrogen) (31Elsharkawy A.

HSC, parental L-cells (LTK–), and Jagged1 expressing L-cells (SN3T9) were cultured on plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 16% fetal calf serum and maintained at 37 °C at an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Plasmid DNA—All plasmid DNA was prepared using a commercial DNA extraction and isolation kit (Maxiprep, Qiagen). IκBα promoter function was studied using the luciferase reporter vector pIκBα wt-Luc vector containing nucleotides –332 to +35 of the human gene promoter (provided by Professor Ron Hay (St. Andrews, UK)). The control Renilla luciferase reporter vector driven by a thymidine kinase promoter (pRLTK) was purchased from Promega (Southampton, UK). CBF1 expression vector pJH282 (provided by Dr Diane Hayward, Baltimore, MD) has been described previously (44Hsieh J.J.-D. Zhou S. Chen L. Young D.B. Hayward S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was carried out on 2 × 106 quiescent or activated rat hepatic stellate cells from the same preparation using immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were polyclonal goat anti-CBF1, rabbit anti-p50 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-acetylated histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). PCR amplification of IκBα promoter was carried out using specific oligonucleotide primers selected within the promoter region of the gene. Sense primer sequence was 5′-cgc taa gag gaa cag cct ag-3′, and antisense primer sequence was 5′- cag ctg gtc gaa aca tgg c-3′. Co-culture of LTK–/SN3T9 with Transfected HSC—Rat HSC were transfected with pJH26A or pJH28A and pRLTK for 24 h and then trypsinized and co-cultured on either on a confluent monolayer of LTK– (parental L-cells)/SN3T9 (Jagged1 expressing L-cells) or placed in transwell which was itself placed in wells with LTK or SN3T9 cells for a further 24 h. Cells were then harvested, and luciferase assays were performed using a dual luciferase kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of firefly luciferase was normalized for differences in transfection efficiency by measurement of the activity of pRLTK. EMSA—NF-κB binding was determined by EMSA as described previously (31Elsharkawy A. Wright M.C. Hay R.T. Arthur M.J.P. Hughes T. Bahr M.J. Degitz K. Mann D.A.

Wild type NF-κB sense oligonucleotide was 5′-tga ggg gac ttt ccc agg 3′; the p50/p65 mutant sense oligonucleotide was 5′-tga ggc gac ttt ccc agg 3′, and the CBF1 mutant sense oligonucleotide was 5′-tga ggg gac ttc ccg agg 3′. Mutated bases are underlined and in boldface type. NF-κB sites within human IκBα promoter were used as probes, namely κB-like 1 (5′-ccc aga gaa atc ccc agc cag-3′), κB1 (5′-ggc ttg gaa att ccc cga gcc-3′), κB-like 2 (5′-cgc agg gag ttt ctc cga tga-3′), κB3 (5′-gtc gga aag act ttc cag cca-3′), κB2 (5′-atc gtg gga aac ccc agg gaa-3′), and κB2 mutant which no longer binds CBF1 (5′-atc gtc ggg aac ccc agg gaa-3′, mutated bases are underlined and in boldface type). For supershift assays, reactions were incubated in the presence of 2 μg of anti-p50, anti-p65, anti-c-Rel, anti-CBF1, anti-JunD, or anti-JunB antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). EMSA and supershift reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis on an 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (37:5:1). FACS Analysis—100 μl of 1 × 106/ml quiescent rat HSC were incubated with 15 μl of rabbit anti-Notch1 polyclonal antibody, or rabbit anti Notch2 antibody, or irrelevant rabbit polyclonal antibody (all at 200 μg/μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were incubated with primary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin/azide. Cells were then labeled with 10 μl of sheep anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma) for a further 30 min and washed as before. Analysis by flow cytometry was carried out on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Activated HSC were dissociated from the flask by 10 min of incubation in citric saline at 37 °C and processed for analysis following the protocol described above. Total RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 quiescent (day 1) and activated (day 7) rat HSC using the Total RNA purification kit (Qiagen, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was generated using 1 μg of total RNA, 1 μl of random hexamer primer (p(dN)6), and RNase-free water (Qiagen, UK), heated at 70 °C for 5 min, and then placed on ice. RNasin (RNase inhibitor), 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase, 1× Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase buffer, and 0.4 mm dNTPs were added, and the mix was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—PCR amplification of Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Notch4, and β-actin cDNAs was carried out using specific oligonucleotide primers selected within the coding regions of the genes. CBF1 amplification was carried out using oligonucleotides designed to cross-react with both mouse and human CBF1 coding regions due to a lack of published rat CBF1 sequence. Notch1 primers used were 5′-cct ggg tgg atg gga aca aac-3′ (sense) and 5′-gaa aag ccg ccg aga tag tca-3′ (antisense) designed to produce a 1277-bp product; Notch2 primers were 5′-ggg cta cac tgg gaa aaa ctg-3′ (sense) and 5′-ctg ggg gac aac gac aaa tga-3′ (antisense) designed to produce an 848-bp product; Notch3 primers were 5′-cgg gat gtg gat gaa tgt ctg-3′ (sense) and 5′-agg ggc tgc gga agg ggt ctc-3′ (antisense) designed to produce a 1482-bp product; Notch4 primers were 5′-gac cgt gtg ggc tct ttc tcc-3′ (sense) and 5′-ggg ctc tgt gtg cct gac ctt-3′ (antisense) designed to produce an 829-bp product; CBF1 primers were 5′-cct cag caa gcg gat aaa-3′ (sense) and 5′-gac atg gag tgg cct gaa-3′ (antisense) designed to produce a predicted 473-bp product, and β-actin primers were 5′-aga ggg aaa tcg tgc gtg aca-3′ (sense) and 5′-aca tct gct gga agg tgg aca-3′ (antisense) designed to produce a 453-bp product. PCRs were composed of 1 μl of cDNA template, 100 ng each of sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers, 2.5 μl of optimized TaqPCR buffer (Promega), 0.4 mm dNTP mixture, and 2 units of Taq polymerase in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Following an initial 5-min incubation at 94 °C, PCRs were performed using a 1-min annealing step (at 59.3 °C for Notch1, 58.3 °C for Notch 2, 60.5 °C for Notch 3, 59.8 °C for Notch 4, 52 °C for CBF1, and 57.2 °C for β-actin), followed by a 2-min elongation step at 72.0 °C and a 45-s denaturation step at 94 °C. A total number of 35 PCR cycles were carried out for amplification of all cDNAs (unless otherwise stated in the figure legend), followed by a final elongation reaction for 10 min at 72.0 °C. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis at 50 V for 90 min through a 1% agarose gel and were detected by ethidium bromide staining. Expected sizes of specific PCR products were verified by reference to a 1-kb DNA ladder. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared, and protein concentration of samples was determined using Bradford DC assay kit (Bio-Rad). 30 or 50 μg of whole cell extracts from rHSC or transfected COS cells, respectively, were then fractionated by electrophoresis through a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were run at a 100 V for 1.5 h prior to transfer onto nitrocellulose. Following blockade of nonspecific protein binding, nitrocellulose blots were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies diluted in TBS/Tween 20 (0.075%) containing 3% Marvel. Mouse monoclonal horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody recognizing FLAG tag of pJH282 was used as 1:20,000 dilution for direct detection of the tagged protein (Sigma). Rat monoclonal antibody directed against the Myc tag of R218H was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. J59 antibody directed against Jagged1 protein was used as described previously (69Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing IκBα was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Goat polyclonal antibody recognizing endogenous CBF1 was used at a dilution of 1:8000. Mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing β-actin was used at a dilution of 1:1000 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were then washed three times in TBS/Tween 20 prior to incubation for 1 h with sheep anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody for IκBα, rabbit anti-goat horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody for CBF1, goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody for β-actin, and rabbit anti-rat horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody for Myc-tagged CBF1 mutant expressed from R218H expression vector (all antibodies were used at 1:2000 dilution in TBS/Tween 20 (0.075%) containing 3% Marvel). After extensive washing in TBS/Tween 20, the blots were processed to distilled water for detection of antigen using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed Mutagenesis of IκBα IκBα Promoter—The mutagenesis was carried out using two-step recombinant PCR. The first reaction was set up using 100 ng of κB2ΔCBF1F sense primer (5′-ctt tcc ctg ggg ttc ccg acg atc g-3′, mutated bases are in boldface and underlined) and 100 ng of IκBαΔCBF1prR antisense primer (5′-ttc gag ctc ggt acc cgg gga tc-3′), 500 ng of pIκBα wt-Luc template, 2.5 μl of optimized Pfu polymerase buffer (Promega), 0.4 mm dNTP mixture, and 2 units of Pfu polymerase in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. PCR was carried with an initial 5-min incubation at 94 °C. This was followed by 40 cycles of a 1-min annealing step at 58 °C, a 2-min elongation step at 72 °C, and a 45-s denaturation step at 94 °C. After 40 cycles a final elongation reaction was carried out for 10 min at 72 °C. The 90-bp PCR product was separated by electrophoresis and purified, and 5 μl of the eluted product was then used in second step PCR, along with 500 ng of pIκBα wt-Luc template and 100 ng of IκBαΔCBF1prF2 sense primer (5′-caa gct tgg acg gcg gca cgg a-3′). The PCR program was set up as described for the first step reaction with two annealing steps, first at 62 °C for 45 s, followed by another 45 s at 48 °C. PCR was carried out for 40 cycles followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was than digested with HindIII and SalI in a 37 °C water bath and separated on 1% agarose gel, excised, purified, and ligated into pGL3 Basic. The presence of the required mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—HSC and COS cells were transfected by the non-liposomal Effectene protocol (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assays were performed using a dual luciferase kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pJH26A (4xCBF1wt), pJH28A (4xCBF1mut) and pIκBαwt promoter-driven expression of firefly luciferase was normalized for differences in transfection efficiency by measurement of the activity of a co-transfected Renilla vector pRLTK. CBF1 Protein Expression and DNA Binding Activity Is Induced in Rat Hepatic Stellate Cells—Activation of HSC cells can be modeled in vitro by culturing freshly isolated (quiescent) rodent or human HSC on plastic in serum-containing media. After 7–10 days in culture HSC adopt a proliferative myofibroblast-like phenotype that closely resembles the phenotype of in vivo activated HSC (33Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Google Scholar). By using this culture model we have reported previously (31Elsharkawy A."

We report here the identification of a novel truncated form of phosphacan, phosphacan short isoform (PSI), that corresponds to the N-terminal carbonic anhydrase- and fibronectin type III-like domains and half of the spacer region. The novel cDNA transcript was isolated by screening of a neonatal brain cDNA expression library using a polyclonal antibody raised against phosphacan. Expression of this transcript in vivo was confirmed by Northern blot hybridization. Analysis of brain protein extracts reveals the presence of a 90-kDa glycosylated protein in the phosphate-buffered saline-insoluble 100,000 × g fraction that reacts with antisera against both phosphacan and a recombinant PSI protein and that has the predicted N-terminal sequence. This protein is post-translationally modified with oligosaccharides, including the HNK-1 epitope, but, unlike phosphacan, it is not a proteoglycan. The expression of the PSI protein varies during central nervous system development in a fashion similar to that observed for phosphacan, being first detected around embryonic day 16 and then showing a dramatic increase in expression to plateau around the second week post-natal. Both the native and recombinant PSI protein can interact with the Ig cell adhesion molecules, F3/contactin and L1, and in neurite outgrowth assays, the PSI protein can promote outgrowth of cortical neurons when used as a coated substrate.

Differentiation and morphogenesis of neural tissues involve a diversity of interactions between neural cells and their environment (1Garwood J. Heck N. Rigato F. Faissner A. Walz W.

Hockfield S. Glia. 1997; 20: 193-202Google Scholar, 3Rauch U. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 349-356Google Scholar). Previously we have characterized DSD-1-PG, one of the more abundant of the soluble CSPGs in the post-natal brain, showing this to be the mouse homolog of phosphacan and demonstrating that it can have opposing effects upon neurite outgrowth according to the neuronal lineage (4Faissner A.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Google Scholar); it is in fact a secreted splice variant of an even larger transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP), RPTP-β (6Maurel P. Rauch U. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2512-2516Google Scholar), also known as PTP-ζ (-zeta) (7Krueger N.X. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7417-7421Google Scholar). Hence phosphacan corresponds to the entire extracellular part of the long RPTP-β receptor (the relative structures of the proteins are illustrated in Fig. 1). These proteins are characterized by a carbonic anhydrase-like (CA) domain at their extracellular N terminus. A third splice variant, the short RPTP-β receptor form, contains the same intracellular phosphatase domains as the long receptor, but, unlike phosphacan and the long RPTP-β, it is distinguished by the absence of an 850-amino acid highly glycosylated sequence, the IS region, which possesses many of the predicted glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment sites. In the CNS, phosphacan and the RPTP-β receptors have punctual spatiotemporal expression patterns that suggest potential roles for these proteins in various developmental processes, including cell migration (8Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Google Scholar), differentiation (9Meyer-Puttlitz B. Junker E. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 366: 44-54Google Scholar), synaptogenesis (10Haunso A. Celio M.R. Margolis R.K. Menoud P.A. Brain Res. 1999; 834: 219-222Google Scholar), synaptic function (11Murai K.K. Misner D. Ranscht B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 181-190Google Scholar), and myelination (12Harroch S. Palmeri M. Rosenbluth J. Custer A. Okigaki M. Shrager P. Blum M. Buxbaum J.D. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7706-7715Google Scholar) (13Garwood J. Rigato F. Heck N. Faissner A. Restor. Neurol. Neurosci. 2001; 19: 51-64Google Scholar), and phosphacan is also up-regulated upon wounding and regeneration in the CNS (14Barker R.A. Dunnett S.B. Faissner A. Fawcett J.W. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 141: 79-93Google Scholar, 15Laywell E.D. Steindler D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 633: 122-141Google Scholar, 16Deller T. Haas C.A. Naumann T. Joester A. Faissner A. Frotscher M. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 829-846Google Scholar). In vitro functional studies have provided evidence for such roles in the development and maintenance of the CNS, and there have been a number of reports of the effects of phosphacan on process outgrowth from neuronal cultures. These have shown that the proteoglycan can either promote or inhibit neurite outgrowth dependent upon the neuronal type tested and the conditions under which it is presented. For example, we have shown previously that phosphacan has outgrowth-promoting properties on mesencephalic and hippocampal neurons (4Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Google Scholar), whereas it is inhibitory for laminin-promoted outgrowth from neonatal dorsal root ganglion explants (5Garwood J. Schnadelbach O. Clement A. Schutte K. Bach A. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3888-3899Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have demonstrated a number of potential binding partners for phosphacan, both in the ECM, such as the tenascins, TN-C (17Milev P. Meyer-Puttlitz B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24650-24653Google Scholar, 18Milev P. Fischer D. Haring M. Schulthess T. Margolis R.K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15501-15509Google Scholar) and TN-R (19Milev P. Chiba A. Haring M. Rauvala H. Schachner M. Ranscht B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6998-7005Google Scholar), and on the cell surface, such as the immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs), F3/contactin (20Peles E. Nativ M. Campbell P.L. Sakurai T. Martinez R. Lev S. Clary D.O. Schilling J. Barnea G. Plowman G.D. et al.Cell. 1995; 82: 251-260Google Scholar), and NrCAM (21Sakurai T. Lustig M. Nativ M. Hemperly J.J. Schlessinger J. Peles E. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 907-918Google Scholar). In addition, a number of growth factors can bind to phosphacan, including bFGF (22Milev P. Monnerie H. Popp S. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21439-21442Google Scholar) and HB-GAM (19Milev P. Chiba A. Haring M. Rauvala H. Schachner M. Ranscht B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6998-7005Google Scholar). Interaction sites on phosphacan have been characterized at three levels (13Garwood J. Rigato F. Heck N. Faissner A. Restor. Neurol. Neurosci. 2001; 19: 51-64Google Scholar). First, there are the long negatively charged CS GAG polymer chains, which can bind, for example, to TAG-1/Axonin-1 (23Milev P. Maurel P. Haring M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15716-15723Google Scholar), and the cytokines, amphoterin (19Milev P. Chiba A. Haring M. Rauvala H. Schachner M. Ranscht B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6998-7005Google Scholar), midkine (24Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kimura T. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12474-12479Google Scholar), and HB-GAM/pleiotrophin (19Milev P. Chiba A. Haring M. Rauvala H. Schachner M. Ranscht B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6998-7005Google Scholar, 25Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Google Scholar). Second, on the core glycoprotein, there are other classes of glycosylation, represented by oligosaccharides carrying epitopes such as HNK-1 (sulfated glucuronic acid) and Lewis-X (sialyl-Lewis-X) (5Garwood J. Schnadelbach O. Clement A. Schutte K. Bach A. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3888-3899Google Scholar), which have also been implicated in IgCAM interactions (17Milev P. Meyer-Puttlitz B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24650-24653Google Scholar). Third, there is the primary protein sequence, which includes the CA, and a fibronectin type III-like (FNIII) domain, but the remaining 80% of the molecule bears no strong homology to other characterized protein data base structures. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel short isoform of phosphacan. This new isoform corresponds to the first third of phosphacan, and although it is glycosylated, it is not a proteoglycan. It is not as readily extracted from brain tissue as phosphacan, perhaps because of stronger interactions with the cell surface. A recombinant protein corresponding to the new isoform sequence can, like phosphacan, also promote neurite outgrowth from cortical neurons. Hence regulated expression of this protein may introduce an extra level of complexity to the proposed functional interactions of phosphacan and the RPTP-β receptor forms during CNS development and regeneration. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 473HD is a rat IgM antibody directed against the chondroitin sulfate DSD-1 epitope (4Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Google Scholar, 26Clement A.M. Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Mandl C. Sugahara K. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28444-28453Google Scholar), 324 is a rat IgG against the cell adhesion molecule L1 (27Rathjen F.G. Schachner M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1-10Google Scholar), and 412 is a rat IgG recognizing both sulfated and non-sulfated epitopes of the HNK-1 carbohydrate (28Kruse J. Mailhammer R. Wernecke H. Faissner A. Sommer I. Goridis C. Schachner M. Nature. 1984; 311: 153-155Google Scholar). Mouse mAb 4–121 against chick F11 cross-reacts with mouse F3/contactin (29Brummendorf T. Hubert M. Treubert U. Leuschner R. Tarnok A. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 711-727Google Scholar) and was provided by F. Rathjen (Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany). 3F8 is a mouse mAb against rat phosphacan (9Meyer-Puttlitz B. Junker E. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 366: 44-54Google Scholar, 30Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Google Scholar) that cross-reacts with mouse phosphacan (5Garwood J. Schnadelbach O. Clement A. Schutte K. Bach A. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3888-3899Google Scholar), and it is available from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Department of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242). Polyclonal sera were all from rabbit. KAF13 was raised against the purified DSD-1-PG (4Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Google Scholar) and has been used to clone all forms of RPTP-β from mouse brain expression libraries (5Garwood J. Schnadelbach O. Clement A. Schutte K. Bach A. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3888-3899Google Scholar), KAF14 was raised against purified TN-C from post-natal mouse brains (31Faissner A. Kruse J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 627-637Google Scholar), polyclonal F3/contactin-1367 was raised against amino acids 37–50 (peptide KGFG-PIFE-EQPINT) of F3/contactin coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (32Koch T. Brugger T. Bach A. Gennarini G. Trotter J. Glia. 1997; 19: 199-212Google Scholar), and anti-PSI was raised against the purified recombinant GST-PSI protein described below using standard immunization protocols (4Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Google Scholar). Antibody Screening of cDNA Expression Libraries—A mouse brain cDNA expression library was screened using the polyclonal antibody, KAF13, at 1 μg/ml as described previously (5Garwood J. Schnadelbach O. Clement A. Schutte K. Bach A. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3888-3899Google Scholar). The library used was BALB/c neonatal whole brain oligo(dT) and random-primed Uni-ZAP XR l (Stratagene). Screening 3 × 106 recombinant phages, yielded four positive clones, corresponding to bases 1144–1509 and 1032–3591 of phosphacan/long RPTP-β and 1186–7850 of short RPTP-β. The fourth cDNA clone contained the truncated ORF corresponding to a shorter form of phosphacan. This begins at base 1276 and ends with a termination codon at 1792. This is followed by a 3′-UTR of 1988 bases. A Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to generate P0 and P7 total mouse brain cDNA libraries from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA. Using PCR amplification of this cDNA, bands from the ORF to 3′-UTR were cloned and sequenced (primers were as follows: 1 (sense), 5′-ATG CGA ATC CTG CAG AGC TTC CTC; 1700 (sense), 5′-GCC TCC TTA AAC AGT GGC T; 1891 (antisense), 5′-CTA TCC AGC TGA AGA GTC ATC GGC; 2120 (antisense), 5′-ACT TAG AAC TGG TGC GGA C). Northern Blot Analysis—Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from 1 g of mouse brain from different developmental stages using a Fast-Track 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). It was separated on formaldehyde/1% agarose gels and then blotted by capillary action onto Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were pre-hybridized for 1 h and then hybridized overnight at 50 °C for DNA probes and at 65 °C for riboprobes. Prehybridization was in hybridization buffer without probe (7% SDS, 50% deionized formamide, 5× SSC, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 0.1% N-lauroyl sarcosine, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science)). Washing for DNA probes was in three changes of wash buffer (40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) at 68 °C for 40 min, and for riboprobes, at 65 °C, 2 × 5 min in 2× SSC (where 1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7), and in 0.1× SSC, 3 × 15 min. Signals were revealed with Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) and amplifying screens at –80 °C. The DNA probe for the 5′-ORF of all RPTP-β isoforms (1–1785; see Fig. 1) was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. Because of homology in the 3′-UTR with the complementary 28 S rRNA sequence, it was not possible to employ a DNA probe without a strong cross-reaction with rRNA, because sequences from the sense strand hybridize to 28 S rRNA. Hence, it was necessary to employ an antisense riboprobe that only hybridized to the sense strand of the PSI transcript. This corresponded to bases 2653–3784 of the 3′-UTR of the PSI transcript and was synthesized with incorporation of radioactive α-35S-UTP (Amersham Biosciences) using T7 RNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas GmbH, St Leon Rot, Germany) and the linearized pBluescript II plasmid (Stratagene) containing the PSI cDNA. A riboprobe against β-actin was used as an indicator of relative RNA concentrations (bases 739–970). Tissue Fractionation—P7 mouse brains were homogenized in different buffers to test the efficiency of different extraction conditions. Protease inhibitors were used throughout (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 μm Aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 5 μm leupeptin, 1 μm antipain, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA). Initially, 20 brains were homogenized in PBS on ice with a mechanical dounce. Nuclei and insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 20 min. Half of this supernatant was detergent-solubilized by addition of 1% Nonidet P-40 and mixing at 4 °C for 1 h. The remaining 600-g PBS supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to precipitate PBS-insoluble material including total cellular membranes. This PBS-insoluble pellet was subsequently resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40/PBS. As an alternative to detergent-solubilization with Nonidet P-40, 10 brains were homogenized in 60 mmn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm sodium acetate and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally, for urea extraction, 10 brains were homogenized in 8 m urea, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein determination used the DC assay kit (Bio-Rad). Deglycosylation Studies—Protein fractions were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 40 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 mm sodium acetate with 0.4 units/100 μg peptide N-glycosidase F (EC 3.5.1.52; Roche Diagnostics), 2 milliunits/100 μg keratanase (endo-β-galactosidase, EC 3.2.1.103; Seikagaku, Kogyo, Tokyo), or 20 milliunits/100 μg chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Partial Protein Purification and Protein Sequencing—50 P7 mouse brains were homogenized in 1% Nonidet P-40/PBS (10 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4-2H2O, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μm antipain, 1 μmortho-phenanthroline, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm EDTA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and then ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1.5 m (35% saturation). Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C followed by filtration through 0.45-μm filter units. This supernatant was loaded onto a methyl HIC (hydrophobic interaction chromatography) column (Bio-Rad) in a Biologic Duo-Flow gradient chromatography system (Bio-Rad), equilibrated with 1.5 m AmSO4/PBS. The column was washed until the baseline was attained and then eluted with a linear gradient from 1.5 to 0 m AmSO4/PBS. The 90-kDa protein eluted at around 1 m AmSO4. The eluate was diluted by addition of 2× binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2,1mm CaCl2) and then loaded onto a concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 20 volumes of binding buffer before being eluted with elution buffer (0.5 m methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl). Sample buffer was added to this eluate, which was then separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred by electroblotting onto ProBlott PVDF membrane (Applied Biosystems). Bands were revealed by Ponceau Red coloration, and the 90-kDa band was confirmed by alignment with an adjacent strip, which was revealed using immunodetection with pAbs KAF13 and anti-PSI. The N-terminal protein sequence of the 90-kDa KAF13-positive band was determined by automatic Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473A microsequencer. Developmental Expression Blot—Whole brains from mice at different developmental stages were homogenized on ice in PBS with protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and then the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in PBS/20 mmn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside with protease inhibitors. Preparation of Recombinant PSI Protein—The recombinant PSI protein was generated by expression in Escherichia coli of a plasmid vector containing the PSI cDNA sequence fused in-frame to GST. The PSI cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-ATG CGG ATC CTG CAG AGC TTC C (which introduces a BamHI restriction site just after the initiation codon by changing the “A” at the sixth base into a “G”) and 5′-CTA TCC AGC TGA AGA GTC ATC GGC (which includes the termination code in the PSI transcript). The PCR cDNA product was purified from an agarose gel and digested with BamHI before being ligated into the plasmid vector, pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences), which had been pre-digested with the restriction endonucleases, BamHI and SmaI. Competent E. coli cells (TOP10F′; Invitrogen) were transformed, and clones were selected. The correct insertion of the PSI cDNA sequence into the vector was verified by DNA sequencing of the entire construct. For recombinant protein expression, the plasmid-bearing bacterial clone was grown in LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A595 nm of 0.8, when protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.05 mm, and the culture was transferred to 24 °C for a further 3 h. Bacteria were pelleted and then lysed in PBS/1% Nonidet P-40 with 50 μg/ml lysozyme. The PSI-GST recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a HiTrap glutathione column (Amersham Biosciences). The GST control protein was produced in the same way using bacteria transformed with the same plasmid vector but without insert. GST Pull-down—Purified GST and GST-PSI protein was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (2 μg/10 μl pre-swollen beads; Amersham Biosciences) in PBS/1 mm dithiothreitol/0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at room temperature with mixing and then washed three times with PBS. 20 μl of beads were incubated with the 1 mg (2 μg/μl) P7 PBS-insoluble 100,000 × g brain fraction in PBS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitors at room temperature with mixing for 1 h, and then placed on ice for 30 min before washing with 3 × 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. The beads were finally boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels before transfer onto PVDF membrane. Immunoprecipitation—Antibodies (2 μg) were added to 2 mg (2 μg/μl) of P7 mouse brain PBS-insoluble 100,000 × g fraction solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm glucose, 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 0.3% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) plus protease inhibitors and incubated at 4 °C with mixing overnight. Subsequently, 50 μl of 50% pre-swollen bead slurry was added for a further 1 h of mixing at 4 °C; protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was used to precipitate the rabbit polyclonal antisera, and anti-rat Ig-Sepharose (Sigma) was employed for the rat antibodies. The beads were then precipitated by centrifugation and washed by three rounds of resuspension and precipitation in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Tris-buffered saline/1% Nonidet P-40/0.1% SDS/0.5% deoxycholate) before being boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane before immunodetection. For coimmunoprecipitation, the 100,000 × g PBS-insoluble mouse brain fraction solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm glucose, 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 0.1% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate plus protease inhibitors was incubated with 2 μg of mAb 324 (anti-L1) or mAb 4–121 (anti-F3/contactin) overnight with mixing at 4 °C. A 50-μl 50% slurry of anti-mouse IgG-agarose (for anti-F3/contactin; Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-rat IgG-agarose (for anti-L1; Sigma-Aldrich) were then added and incubated with mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were precipitated by centrifugation and then resuspended and reprecipitated three times with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, before being boiled with SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to PVDF membranes. Phosphacan Purification—Phosphacan was purified from detergent-free physiological saline-buffered brain lysates from post-natal day 7 to 14 mice as described previously (4Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Google Scholar) using a combination of affinity chromatography with the mAb, 473HD, bound to Sepharose resin and anion-exchange chromatography (4Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Google Scholar). It was quantitated using the protein assay (Bio-Rad) and by the determination of uronic acid equivalents (33Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Neuronal cell cultures were established from embryonic day 17 (E17) mouse brains. The cerebral hemispheres were dissected in PBS, and the meninges were removed. Dissociation was achieved by addition of 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by passage through a sieve with 48-μm pores. The resulting cell suspension was plated on coverslips at a density of 7,000 cells/cm2 in minimal Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with the N2 mixture, namely 5 μg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 100 μm putrescine, 30 nm selenite (34Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Google Scholar), 1 mm pyruvate, 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin, and 100 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich). The cultures were kept in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Neurite Outgrowth Assays—E17 mouse cortical neurons were plated on supports coated with different substrates; glass coverslips were treated with 15 μg/ml poly-l-lysine in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.2, for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were then washed with water and dried. Purified phosphacan (50 μg/ml uronic acid equivalents) or recombinant proteins (50 μg/ml) were coated for 4 h at 37 °C. After coating, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS. After 24 h of culture, neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min and a blocking step with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, cells were stained with a mAb directed against the neuronal marker, β3-tubulin (mouse; Sigma; 2-h incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS) and then revealed with a cy3-conjugated antibody (goat anti-mouse-cy3; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; 30-min incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS). The coverslips were then mounted on slides in Mowiol. Neurons were observed using a DMRB microscope (Leica), and pictures were taken with an axiocam camera (Zeiss). A first parameter considered was the fraction of process-bearing cells (with at least a process longer than one neuronal cell body) from at least 100 neurons per experiment, chosen at random. Subsequently the neurite lengths of the longest neurite on each process-bearing neuron was measured, and morphometric analysis was performed using the ImageTool software (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). Three independent experiments were performed, and the data were analyzed with the Kyplot software (Kyence Inc.) using one-way analysis of variance statistics (α = 0.05), followed by a Tukey test. Antibody Screening of Brain cDNA Expression Libraries Yields a Novel Splice Variant of Phosphacan/RPTP-β—The cDNA corresponding to phosphacan was cloned previously (5Garwood J. Schnadelbach O. Clement A. Schutte K. Bach A. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3888-3899Google Scholar) from a mouse cDNA expression library using KAF13, a pAb raised against the entire proteoglycan purified from post-natal mouse brain. In addition"
https://openalex.org/W2073152187,"Silencing of the MLH1 gene by promoter hypermethylation is the mechanism underlying the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype in endometrial cancers. However, the profile of CpG methylation in a wide range of MLH1 promoters in endometrial cancers and in the normal endometrium is largely unknown. The present study investigates the region 700 bp upstream of MLH1 covering 48 CpG sites using bisulfite sequencing. Methylation status was classified as full (over 80% of CpGs are methylated), partial (10–80%) or nonmethylation (less than 10%). Of 56 endometrioid endometrial cancers, 16 (29%) were fully methylated, 14 (25%) were partially methylated and 26 (46%) were Q1not methylated. Analyses of MLH1 by immunohistochemical means and of MSI revealed that the Q2degree, rather than region-specific methylation of CpG islands is critical for decreased MLH1 expression and the MSI phenotype. Among 12 patients with methylated cancers, five (42%) patients contained methylated promoters in their normal endometria with profiles similar to those of cancer lesions, and these were associated with the MSI phenotype. In contrast, only one of 31 (3%) normal endometria from patients without endometrial malignancies harbored methylated promoters. These findings suggest that hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter is frequent in the histologically normal endometrium adjacent to cancers, supporting the notion that hypermethylation of mismatch repair genes is the initial step that triggers various genetic events in endometrial carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2006399108,"The Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) contain a translocation, t(11;22), which results in the novel oncogenic fusion protein EWS/FLI1. Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and their receptors (PDGFR) are involved in the induction and proliferation of numerous solid tumors and are the potential candidates for novel targeted antitumor therapy. Since a relation was reported between PDGF-C and EWS/FLI1, we sought to characterize the PDGF signaling pathway in ESFT. Eight out of nine ESFT cell lines were found to express significant levels of beta-PDGFR. Interestingly, none of the tested cell lines expressed alpha-PDGFR, which is the receptor isotype required for PDGF-C binding. By immunohistochemical staining 47 of 52 (90.4%) archival tumor samples from patients with ESFT were positive for beta-PDGFR. ESFT cell lines were treated with PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB ligands to evaluate downstream signaling. Autophosphorylation of beta-PDGFR and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma, PI3Kp85 and Shc were detected only in PDGF-BB-stimulated cells that express beta-PDGFR. Receptor function was further evaluated using chemotaxis assays that showed TC-32 cell migration towards PDGF-BB. A specific PDGFR kinase inhibitor AG1295 blocked beta-PDGFR activation, downstream signaling, growth in cell culture and chemotaxis of TC-32 cells. AG1295 also delayed tumor formation and prolonged survival in an ESFT animal model. We conclude that ESFT express beta-PDGFR and that this is a functional and potentially crucial signaling pathway. Therefore, beta-PDGFRs may provide a novel therapeutic target in ESFT that can be utilized to design better treatment modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2075310459,"In animal models, brain ischemia causes changes in respiratory capacity, mitochondrial morphology, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria as well as a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. However, the causal relationship of the cellular processes leading to mitochondrial deterioration in brain has not yet been clarified. Here, by applying various techniques, we used isolated rat brain mitochondria to investigate how hypoxia/reoxygenation and nonphysiological Ca2+ concentrations in the low micromolar range affect active (state 3) respiration, membrane permeability, swelling, and morphology of mitochondria. Either transient hypoxia or a micromolar rise in extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration, given as a single insult alone, slightly decreased active respiration. However, the combination of both insults caused devastating effects. These implied almost complete loss of active respiration, release of both NADH and cytochrome c, and rupture of mitochondria, as shown by electron microscopy. Mitochondrial respiration deteriorated even in the presence of cyclosporin A, documenting that membrane permeabilization occurred independent of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Ca2+ has to enter the mitochondrial matrix in order to mediate this mitochondrial injury, because blockade of the mitochondrial Ca2+-transport system by ruthenium red in combination with CGP37157 completely prevented damage. Furthermore, protection of respiration from Ca2+-mediated damage by the adenine nucleotide ADP, but not by AMP, during hypoxia/reoxygenation is consistent with the delayed susceptibility of brain mitochondria to prolonged hypoxia, which is observed in vivo.

Stroke commonly results in tissue infarction characterized by necrotic cell death of all cell types within the infarcted area of the brain. From investigations using animal models of stroke (1Sims N.R. Anderson M.F. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 511-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 2Anderson M.F. Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it has become evident that mitochondria are injured during cerebral ischemia and post-ischemic reperfusion. Ischemia induces a decrease in the mitochondrial capacity for respiratory activity (1Sims N.R. Anderson M.F. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 511-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 2Anderson M.F. Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Brain mitochondria undergo ultrastructural changes after transient and during permanent cerebral ischemia. After transient focal ischemia, cortical neuronal mitochondria become injured, which is manifested by condensation, increased matrix density, and deposits of electron-dense material, finally resulting in disintegration. In contrast, permanent ischemia causes increasing loss of matrix density, associated with mitochondrial swelling, which disappears after 24 h of focal ischemia (3Solenski N.J. diPierro C.G. Trimmer P.A. Kwan A.L. Helms G.A. Stroke. 2002; 33: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A further response to cerebral ischemia is the permeabilization of at least the outer mitochondrial membrane. This results in the liberation of proapoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c, caspase 9, and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (4Namura S. Nagata I. Takami S. Masayasu H. Kikuchi H. Stroke. 2001; 32: 1906-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Sugawara T. Noshita N. Lewen A. Gasche Y. Ferrand-Drake M. Fujimura M. Morita-Fujimura Y. Chan P.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 209-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration during ischemia/reperfusion might be a signal for permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane. In rat CA1 pyramidal neurons of organotypic slices subjected to a hypoxic-hypoglycemic treatment, an increase in cellular calcium was shown (6Zhang Y. Lipton P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3307-3315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated cytosolic calcium concentrations favor the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (7Huser J. Rechenmacher C.E. Blatter L.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2129-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 8Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In fact, it could be demonstrated that cyclosporin A as well as the non-immunosuppressive analogue N-methyl-Val-4-cyclosporin A, both of which are known to prevent opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, diminished the infarct size, but they could not completely prevent tissue necrosis (9Friberg H. Wieloch T. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Matsumoto S. Friberg H. Ferrand-Drake M. Wieloch T. J. Cereb.

Thus, other mechanisms besides the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore seem to be involved in tissue damage during ischemia/reperfusion. From in vitro studies using isolated brain mitochondria, it has become clear that the release of cytochrome c does not necessarily require the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (12Schild L. Keilhoff G. Augustin W. Reiser G. Striggow F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Andreyev A. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c has been identified as an important modulator of death and survival in cells (14Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The outcome for tissue survival after transient ischemia in in vivo models of stroke depends upon the interplay between a variety of factors, such as increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and substrate supply. Therefore, in vitro models are required in order to delineate the effect of the distinct factors separately from their subsequent interaction. In this context, investigations on isolated brain mitochondria have revealed that Ca2+ accumulation, a hallmark of ischemia/reperfusion, can either inhibit or stimulate H2O2 production (15Starkov A.A. Polster B.M. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments with isolated mitochondria demonstrated that the BH3 domain of Bax induces the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (16Polster B.M. Kinnally K.W. Fiskum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37887-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of the present in vitro study was to use isolated brain mitochondria to elucidate the role played by hypoxia/ reoxygenation and elevated extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration as signals for permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane for matrix and intermembrane space proteins. Therefore, we subjected isolated rat brain mitochondria to hypoxia/reoxygenation and/or elevated extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration and determined respiration, mitochondrial morphology, cytochrome c release, and membrane permeability by applying various complementary techniques. We found that in hypoxia/reoxygenation an elevated extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration dramatically enhanced inhibition of active respiration. Moreover, Ca2+ had to enter the mitochondrial matrix to mediate this effect. Under these conditions there was a complete loss of mitochondrial integrity. The presence of ADP, but not AMP, during hypoxia/reoxygenation completely prevented mitochondrial damage. Permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane did not depend on cyclosporin A, a compound known to keep the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the closed state. Materials—Cyclosporin A was purchased from Sigma, cytochrome c from Roche Diagnostics, mouse monoclonal cytochrome c antibody from Pharmingen, and anti-mouse Ig and horseradish peroxidase from Roche Diagnostics. CGP37157 was from Tocris (Cologne, Germany). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Preparation of Brain Mitochondria—Mitochondria were prepared from the brains of 220–240-g male Wistar rats in ice-cold medium containing 250 mm mannitol, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at pH 7.4 (isolation medium) using a standard procedure (17Schild L. Westphal S. Scheithauer S. Holfeld M. Augustin W. Sabel B.A. Acta Ophthalmol. Scand. 1996; 74: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After the initial isolation, Percoll was used for purification of mitochondria from a fraction containing some endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membranes. The mitochondria were well coupled, as indicated by a respiratory control index greater than 4 with glutamate plus malate as substrates. Protein content was measured according to the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Incubation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria (0.5–1.0 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in a medium containing 10 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 60 mm KCl, 60 mm Tris, 110 mm mannitol, and 1 mm free Mg2+ at pH 7.4 and 30 °C. Extramitochondrial calcium was adjusted by using Ca2+-EGTA buffers. For calculating the concentration of free calcium, we used the complexing constants according to Fabiato and Fabiato (19Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia was produced by bubbling 2 ml of the incubation medium with N2 until oxygen was not detectable any more by means of a Clark-type electrode. Afterward, the mitochondria added to the medium further decreased the oxygen concentration via the respiratory chain. The final oxygen concentration was less than 2 nmol/ml. As the K m value of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase is about 0.3 μm, the limiting effect of oxygen was illustrated independently by the collapse of the membrane potential measured by means of a TPP+-sensitive electrode in separate experiments (data not shown). A 2-ml volume of air-saturated incubation medium was added to achieve reoxygenation. Measurement of Respiration—Oxygen uptake of the mitochondria was measured at 30 °C in a thermostat-controlled chamber equipped with a Clark-type electrode. For the calibration of the oxygen electrode, the oxygen content of the air-saturated incubation medium was taken to be 217 nmol/ml (20Reynafarje B. Costa L.E. Lehninger A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Measurement of Mitochondrial Swelling—The absorption of mitochondrial incubations was measured with a Varian spectrophotometer (Cary 1E) at 546 nm. Calcium-dependent swelling caused by the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore was induced by adding 200 μm CaCl2. Immunoblotting for Detection of Cytochrome c—After 10 min of incubation, 2-ml samples of the incubation mixture were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for Western blot analysis as described by Ghafourifar et al. (21Ghafourifar P. Schenk U. Klein S.D. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31185-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—For electron microscopy, three independent mitochondrial preparations were used for each incubation strategy. After sedimentation at 320 × g at 4 °C, the mitochondrial pellet was fixed with a mixture of 4% formaldehyde (freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde) and 0.4% glutaraldehyde for1hat4 °C. Thereafter, the pellet was rinsed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at 4 °C, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, en bloc contrasted with 1% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol, and flat-embedded between two polyethylene sheets in Curcupan (Fluka/Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Each washing and incubation step was followed by sedimentation at 320 × g at 4 °C to collect the mitochondria. Ultrathin sections (50–70 nm) were prepared with a Leica Ultracut UCT (Bensheim, Germany), mounted on Form-var-coated slot grids, and examined with a Zeiss transmission electron microscope 900 (Oberkochen, Germany). Influence of Extramitochondrial Ca2+ and Hypoxia/Reoxygenation on Mitochondrial Respiration—To investigate whether elevated extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration plays a role in the impairment of mitochondrial function during ischemia/reperfusion, respiration of isolated rat brain mitochondria was analyzed. The influence of extramitochondrial Ca2+ alone and of the combination of a rise in Ca2+ with hypoxia/reoxygenation was tested (Fig. 1). First, at three different extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations (0, 1.5, and 3.5 μm) isolated rat brain mitochondria were subjected to 10 min of hypoxia and 5 min of reoxygenation in the absence of substrates. In general, during hypoxia/reoxygenation no substrates were present. After the addition of 5 mm glutamate plus 5 mm malate, active respiration (state 3) was induced by the addition of 200 μm ADP. At 3.5 μm extramitochondrial Ca2+, a decrease of about 30% in comparison with Ca2+-free incubation, was measured (Fig. 1A, black bars). The rate of active respiration of freshly isolated mitochondria was determined to be 71.0 ± 4.9 (n = 18) nmol of O2 × min–1 × mg–1 of mitochondrial protein. In Ca2+-free incubation, 10 min of hypoxia followed by 5 min of reoxygenation caused a significant decrease in active respiration amounting to about 50%. The Ca2+ rise enhanced the inhibition of respiration by hypoxia/reoxygenation in a dose-dependent manner. In the case of 3.5 μm extramitochondrial Ca2+, active respiration finally decreased down to about 15% of active respiration of freshly isolated mitochondria (Fig. 1A, gray bars). In the next series of experiments we investigated the influence of the duration of hypoxia on active respiration (state 3) of isolated rat brain mitochondria. Therefore, the time of hypoxia was varied in the absence of extramitochondrial Ca2+ or in the presence of 3.5 μm Ca2+, and then active respiration was measured immediately after reoxygenation. In Ca2+-free incubation, active respiration decreased within a hypoxic period of 15 min to 58% of initial state 3 respiration (Fig. 1B, black bars). At any hypoxic period, 3.5 μm extramitochondrial Ca2+ caused a substantial additional reduction of respiration (Fig. 1B, gray bars). To investigate whether the deleterious effect on active respiration found after hypoxia/reoxygenation by Ca2+ is exerted from the inside or outside of mitochondria, we repeated the experiments in the presence of ruthenium red in combination with CGP37157. Under these conditions both Ca2+ uptake by the electrogenic uniporter and Ca2+ efflux by the Na+-Ca2+-exchanger is blocked. In Fig. 2, oxygen traces after 10 min of hypoxia and 5 min of reoxygenation (trace a), after 10 min of hypoxia and 5 min of reoxygenation in the presence of 3.5 μm Ca2+ (trace b), and in the additional presence of 2 μm ruthenium red and 25 μm CGP37157 (trace c) are presented. 3.5 μm extramitochondrial Ca2+ caused a decrease in active respiration (14.6 ± 3.4 (n = 4) versus 21.9 ± 2.8 (n = 4) nmol of O2/min/mg of mitochondrial protein). The block of the mitochondrial Ca2+ transport system not only prevented Ca2+-induced decrease in active respiration but also partially protected mitochondria from hypoxia/reoxygenation-mediated damage of active respiration (32.0 ± 4.4 (n = 4) versus 21.9 ± 2.3 (n = 4) nmol of O2/min/mg of mitochondrial protein). Thus, protection could be partial because small amounts of endogenous Ca2+ are present during exposure of mitochondria to hypoxia/reoxygenation. In conclusion, Ca2+ exerts its deleterious effect in the mitochondrial matrix. Adenine nucleotides are present commonly within mammalian cells. In the ischemic phase, ATP is converted first into ADP and subsequently into AMP to maintain energy-consuming processes for as long as possible. In a separate series of experiments, we tested whether extramitochondrial ADP or extramitochondrial AMP affects the decrease in active respiration by hypoxia/reoxygenation. Fig. 3 shows the oxygen traces of a normoxic control (trace a), of mitochondria after 10 min of hypoxia followed by 5 min of reoxygenation in the presence of 3.5 μm extramitochondrial Ca2+ (trace b) and in the additional presence of 5 mm ADP (trace c) or 5 mm AMP (trace d). The presence of ADP during hypoxia/reoxygenation almost completely protected brain mitochondria from decrease in active respiration (62.0 ± 5.7 (n = 5) versus 19.2 ± 3.6 (n = 5) and 73.0 ± 4.4 (n = 5) nmol of O2/min/mg of mitochondrial protein). Under this condition, the addition of 200 μm ADP did not result in any further stimulation of respiration because the ADP added previously was not completely consumed by the mitochondria. In contrast, AMP had no protective effect (11.7 versus 19.2 nmol of O2/min/mg). Mitochondrial Morphology Is Influenced by Extramitochondrial Ca2+ and Hypoxia/Reoxygenation—To elucidate the role of hypoxia/reoxygenation and elevated extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration on mitochondrial morphology, we performed electron microscopy analyses. The electron micrographs were inspected by two independent investigators blinded to the treatment group. Typical structures corresponding to distinct incubation conditions are presented at a magnification of 1:20,000 in Fig. 4. In each image in Fig. 4 (A–D) an inset illustrates detailed structures at the magnification of 1:30,000. Increasing the extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration from zero up to 3.5 μm did not significantly modify the mitochondrial structure (Fig. 4, B versus A). We were not able to detect changes in the cristae structure. Moreover, intact outer membrane structures were clearly maintained. Hypoxia/reoxygenation by itself (Fig. 4C) led to several changes in mitochondrial morphology. Besides a population of mitochondria with normal morphology, mitochondria with dented (bleb-like) outer membranes and another population of mitochondria with loss of cristae were found. The combination of 3.5 μm extramitochondrial Ca2+ with hypoxia/reoxygenation caused dramatic changes in mitochondrial morphology. Mitochondrial integrity nearly completely disappeared (Fig. 4D). Instead, parts of the mitochondrial structures and conglomerates were found (mitochondrial debris). The loss of mitochondrial structure caused by hypoxia/reoxygenation seems to illustrate an irreversible and uncontrolled breakdown of mitochondria. Mitochondrial disruption was also studied by light scattering experiments. The protocol of typical traces is shown in Fig. 5A. Isolated rat brain mitochondria, which were preincubated at 3.5 μm Ca2+, could be forced to swell by an extramitochondrial Ca2+ stimulus only when Ca2+ reached very high concentrations, such as 200 μm (trace 3). This low sensitivity to Ca2+ has already been reported previously (12Schild L. Keilhoff G. Augustin W. Reiser G. Striggow F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In trace 1, the presence of 2 μm cyclosporin A prevented mitochondrial swelling after stimulation with 200 μm Ca2+. Cyclosporin A keeps the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the closed state. Thus, Ca2+ concentrations in the high micromolar range induce opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in intact brain mitochondria. However, in mitochondria that previously had been exposed to 10 min of hypoxia and 5 min of reoxygenation in the continuous presence of 3.5 μm Ca2+, the basal value of absorbance was already increased, most likely because of the condensation seen in the electron micrographs of mitochondria (see Fig. 4). Moreover, we could not find any decrease in absorbance even after adding a stimulus of 200 μm Ca2+ (trace 2). This observation confirms our conclusion that mitochondria lose their morphological integrity during hypoxia/reoxygenation in the presence of 3.5 μm Ca2+, because intact brain mitochondria would be able to swell. Furthermore, the involvement of the permeability transition pore in mitochondrial rupture because of hypoxia/reoxygenation in the presence of Ca2+ was studied by respiration experiments (Fig. 5B). Cyclosporin A, applied at a concentration which was sufficient to prevent intact mitochondria from Ca2+-induced swelling, could not prevent decrease in active respiration. Respiration measurements (Fig. 5B) show that for active respiration of brain mitochondria subjected to substrate-free 10 min of hypoxia and 5 min of reoxygenation in the presence of 3.5 μm Ca2+, no significant difference was found between the values either with or without 2 μm cyclosporin A. Thus, we conclude that mitochondrial rupture did not require the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. A further series of experiments was performed to test whether mitochondrial constituents are lost during hypoxia/reoxygenation in the presence of low micromolar Ca2+, to substantiate our conclusion of mitochondrial disintegration under these conditions. It is well known that the active respiration of intact brain mitochondria is insensitive to extramitochondrial cytochrome c and NADH, because neither of these compounds can permeate through the mitochondrial membrane system. Therefore, we analyzed whether active respiration after 10 min of hypoxia and 5 min of reoxygenation in the presence of 3.5 μm Ca2+ becomes sensitive to extramitochondrial cytochrome c and NADH. This approach was used to demonstrate membrane permeabilization. Respiration of intact mitochondria is shown in Fig. 6A. The oxygen consumption after hypoxia/reoxygenation is depicted in Fig. 6B. In intact mitochondria, ADP caused a 4.6-fold increase in respiration (stimulation of active respiration) to 87 ± 5.8 (n = 5) nmol of O2/min/mg of mitochondrial protein, whereas after hypoxia/reoxygenation the rate of active respiration was as low as 15.2 ± 1.9 (n = 5) nmol of O2/min/mg of mitochondrial protein. The application of 30 μm cytochrome c after hypoxia/reoxygenation in the presence of 3.5 μm Ca2+ only very moderately accelerated state 3 respiration (19.6 ± 2.2 (n = 5) versus 15.2 ± 1.9 (n = 5) nmol of O2/min/mg of mitochondrial protein). In contrast, a nearly 4-fold increase in the rate of oxygen consumption was found in the presence of 5 mm NADH in the incubation medium (55.3 ± 3.3 (n = 5) versus 15.2 ± 1.9 (n = 5) nmol of O2/min/mg of mitochondrial protein). This oxygen consumption was not associated with ATP synthesis, because oligomycin was without influence. In intact mitochondria, however, the inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligomycin slowed down the rate of active respiration to resting (state 4) level (18.7 ± 2.3 (n = 5) versus 87 ± 5.8 (n = 5) nmol of O2/min/mg of mitochondrial protein). Stimulation of oxygen consumption by extramitochondrial NADH clearly demonstrates that the inner mitochondrial membrane becomes permeabilized, because under physiological conditions the mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH. The moderate increase in respiration after cytochrome c addition proves that most of the cytochrome c was still associated with parts of the respiratory chain. In fact, Western blot analysis revealed that only 15% of the cytochrome c pool was released into the incubation medium during 10 min of hypoxia and 5 min of reoxygenation in the presence of 3.5 μm Ca2+ (data not shown). Impairment of Mitochondria upon Ischemia/Reperfusion— Animal models of stroke have revealed that mitochondria are impaired upon ischemia/reperfusion in brain tissue. Decrease in respiratory capacity (1Sims N.R. Anderson M.F. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 511-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), change in mitochondrial morphology (3Solenski N.J. diPierro C.G. Trimmer P.A. Kwan A.L. Helms G.A. Stroke. 2002; 33: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane system have been reported (4Namura S. Nagata I. Takami S. Masayasu H. Kikuchi H. Stroke. 2001; 32: 1906-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A further hallmark of ischemic neuronal insults is the disturbance of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, characterized by increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is a well known trigger of mitochondrial damage (6Zhang Y. Lipton P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3307-3315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia/reoxygenation caused impairment of mitochondrial function in cultured astrocytes (22Makarov P.R. Wiswedel I. Augustin W. Schild L. Brain Res. 2002; 933: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and isolated mitochondria (23Schild L. Reinheckel T. Wiswedel I. Augustin W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that hypoxia/reoxygenation induces decrease in active respiration and changes in mitochondrial structure, which is characterized by a subpopulation of mitochondria with dented (bleb-like) outer membranes and another subpopulation of mitochondria with diminished number of cristae. Mitochondria isolated from brain display high resistance to relatively high extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations in comparison with mitochondria from other tissues such as liver (13Andreyev A. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Also, recently published data from our own studies (12Schild L. Keilhoff G. Augustin W. Reiser G. Striggow F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have shown that Ca2+ in the micromolar range induces only a moderate decrease in active respiration and the release of a small amount of cytochrome c through the outer membrane from brain mitochondria with still intact morphology. Ca2+ has to enter the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca2+ transport system in order to affect the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. It is known that alterations in the Ca2+ concentration can modify the number of contact sites between the inner and outer membrane, possibly by unmasking nonspecific channels of the mitochondrial outer membrane such as the voltage dependent anion channel (24Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 25Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Bakker A. Bernaert I. De Bie M. Ravingerova T. Ziegelhoffer A. Van Belle H. Jacob W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This might explain the Ca2+-mediated change in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane system. At the cellular level, an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration has been identified as the major cause for mitochondrial impairment, such as in striatal neurons (27Alano C.C. Beutner G. Dirksen R.T. Gross R.A. Sheu S.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and in hippocampal astrocytes (28Kahlert S. Reiser G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the application of hypoxia/reoxygenation sensitizes mitochondria to moderately elevated extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration. Then, even low micromolar Ca2+ causes dramatic functional and morphological changes in isolated brain mitochondria. These include permeabilization and breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane. Again, Ca2+ has to enter the mitochondrial matrix to exert the deleterious effect, because blocking the Ca2+ transport system completely protected mitochondria from Ca2+-mediated damage. Transient hypoxia in combination with Ca2+ elevated into the low micromolar range most appropriately mimics the in vivo situation during ischemia/reperfusion. Interestingly, in our experiments, the impairment of mitochondria was not sensitive to cyclosporin A. In vivo studies, however, using animal models of stroke indicate the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (10Matsumoto S. Friberg H. Ferrand-Drake M. Wieloch T. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the latter seems to be true only for a part of the brain cells localized within the infarct area, because cyclosporin A only diminished the size of the infarct but could not completely prevent necrosis (10Matsumoto S. Friberg H. Ferrand-Drake M. Wieloch T. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 29Kuroda S. Janelidze S. Siesjo B.K. Brain Res. 1999; 835: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Vachon P. Beaudry F. Marier J.F. Ste-Marie L. Montgomery J. Brain Res. 2002; 943: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It still remains unclear which Ca2+-mediated mechanism is responsible for the cyclosporin A-independent rupture of the mitochondrial membrane. Investigations on isolated mitochondria reveal that elevated Ca2+ concentration, hypoxia/reoxygenation, or the combination of both treatments clearly induces distinct effects. These observations suggest that, depending on the degree of hypoxia and the level of the cytosolic Ca2+, mechanisms other than the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore may be involved in the process of mitochondrial damage during ischemia/reperfusion. Impact of Mitochondrial Deterioration after Ischemia/Reperfusion on Brain Cell Fate—A complete breakdown of mitochondrial ATP production is a prerequisite of necrotic cell death in brain (31Martin L.J. Brambrink A.M. Price A.C. Kaiser A. Agnew D.M. Ichord R.N. Traystman R.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ATP is required for the maintenance of cellular morphology, ion homeostasis, protein synthesis, and many other cellular functions. Moreover, ATP is even necessary to perform the apoptotic cell death program (32Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Another factor in inducing neuronal demise is the change of the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. Depending on the mode of activation, permeabilization can cause either apoptosis or necrosis. Distinct permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane can be achieved in brain mitochondria by increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations or by members of the Bcl-2 family in cooperation with cardiolipin (33Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R71-R73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This type of permeabilization causes a partial release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c (12Schild L. Keilhoff G. Augustin W. Reiser G. Striggow F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Andreyev A. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The members of the Bcl-2 family also interact with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (34Vieira H.L. Kroemer G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Reversible permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane by opening of the permeability transition pore also causes the release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria. If sufficient ATP is available within the cell, apoptosis is initiated. In fact, signs of apoptosis and cyclosporin A sensitivity in brain injury have been demonstrated in animal models of stroke (35Noshita N. Sugawara T. Fujimura M. Morita-Fujimura Y. Chan P.H. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast, the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane causes necrotic cell death (36Li P.A. Kristian T. He Q.P. Siesjo B.K. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 165: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which can be induced by permanent opening of the permeability transition pore by Ca2+ overload (37Lemasters J.J. Qian T. He L.

Neurochem. 2002; 80: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) or by massive lipid peroxidation (39von Zglinicki T. Wiswedel I. Trumper L. Augustin W. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1991; 57: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration in the low micromolar range leads to cyclosporin A-insensitive (e.g. permeability transition pore-independent) disruption of the mitochondrial membrane. Isolated mitochondria can be maintained under conditions of almost complete anoxia (23Schild L. Reinheckel T. Wiswedel I. Augustin W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas in vivo, some oxygen may diffuse from the environment into the infarct area. Both the in vivo studies of stroke and the cell culture investigation on hypoxia/reoxygenation require a relatively long period of hypoxia to reach significant injury (2Anderson M.F. Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, in isolated brain mitochondria only a few minutes of hypoxia are sufficient to cause dramatic damage. Differences in local oxygen concentration may be the reason for this apparent discrepancy between in vivo and isolated mitochondria experiments in the time required to reach injury. We have found that at elevated extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations, ADP at physiological concentration (5 mm) protects mitochondria from hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced damage. Only when all of the ADP is converted into AMP, mitochondrial damage occurs. This finding may contribute further to the fact that longer periods of ischemia are required to achieve tissue damage in comparison with isolated mitochondria that have to be exposed only for a short period of time to hypoxia in order to induce mitochondrial damage. Pathological Consequences in Brain Mitochondria Caused by Ischemia/Reperfusion—From both the present data and the observations obtained with animal models of stroke, we conclude that three qualitatively different situations of stroke injury have to be distinguished. (i) Increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations into the low micromolar range induce permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c, resulting in the induction of apoptosis. (ii) Short periods of hypoxia or moderate elevation of the extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration cause reversible opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore followed by the release of proapoptotic factors from morphologically intact mitochondria, also resulting in the induction of apoptosis. (iii) Long-lasting hypoxia, followed by reoxygenation at moderately elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, leads to permanent opening of the permeability transition pore or the permeability transition pore-independent disruption of the mitochondrial membrane. The resulting failure of mitochondrial energy metabolism causes necrotic cell death. In conclusion, we provide evidence that isolated rat brain mitochondria are highly vulnerable to hypoxia/reoxygenation applied in combination with the rise of the extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration into the low micromolar range. However, each stimulus, Ca2+ or hypoxia/reoxygenation, applied individually can be well tolerated by brain mitochondria. Thus, our data explain the apparent discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data concerning the harm exerted by cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in the low micromolar range. When observed in vitro, high resistance of mitochondria is seen, whereas in vivo, upon ischemia/reperfusion cell death occurs. Therefore, in cells of the nervous tissue therapeutic concepts aimed at preventing neural damage after ischemia (stroke) should focus on the prevention of pathological elevations of cytosolic Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1970174002,"The p85alpha subunit of PI3-K and Btk are two crucial components of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling pathway. In the present study, we showed that primary splenic B cells from p85alpha null and xid (Btk-deficient) mice fail to induce cyclin D2 expression and enter early G1, but not S phase of the cell cycle in response to BCR engagement. Furthermore, these Btk or p85alpha null B cells displayed increased cell death compared with wild type following BCR engagement. These findings are further confirmed by studies showing that specific pharmacological inhibitors of Btk (LFM-A13), PI3-K (LY294002 and Wortmannin) and PLCgamma (U73122) also block cyclin D2 expression and S phase entry following BCR stimulation, as well as triggering apoptosis. Collectively, these data provide evidence for the concept that the B-cell signalosome (p85alpha, Btk, BLNK and PLCgamma) is involved in regulating cyclin D2 expression in response to BCR engagement. PKC and intracellular calcium are two major downstream effectors of the B-cell signalosome and can be activated by PMA and ionomycin, respectively. In small resting (G0) B cells, costimulation with PMA and ionomycin, but not PMA or ionomycin alone, induces cyclin D2 expression and cell-cycle progression. Consistent with this, we also showed that the BCR-mediated cyclin D2 induction could be abolished by pretreatment of resting B cells with specific inhibitors of capacitative Ca(2+) entry (SK&F 96365) or PKC (Gö6850). Our present results lead us to propose a model in which the B-cell signalosome targets cyclin D2 via the Ca(2+) and PKC-dependent signalling cascades to mediate cell-cycle progression in response to BCR engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2013526303,"Muscle cell differentiation is controlled by a complex set of interactions between tissue restricted transcription factors, ubiquitously expressed transcription factors, and cell cycle regulatory proteins. We previously found that amplification of MDM2 in rhabdomyosarcoma cells interferes with MyoD activity and consequently inhibits overt muscle cell differentiation (1). Recently, we found that MDM2 interacts with Sp1 and inhibits Sp1-dependent transcription and that pRb can restore Sp1 activity by displacing MDM2 from Sp1 (2). In this report, we show that forced expression of Sp1 can restore MyoD activity and restore overt muscle cell differentiation in cells with amplified MDM2. Furthermore, we show that pRb can also restore MyoD activity and muscle cell differentiation in cells with amplified MDM2. Surprisingly, we found that the MyoD-interacting domain of pRb is dispensable for this activity. We show that the C-terminal, MDM2-interacting domain of pRb is both necessary and sufficient to restore muscle cell differentiation in cells with amplified MDM2. We also show that the C-terminal MDM2-interacting domain of pRb can promote premature differentiation of proliferating myoblast cells. Our data support a model in which the pRb-MDM2 interaction modulates Sp1 activity during normal muscle cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2023124412,"The hairy cells (HCs) of hairy-cell leukemia are intrinsically activated mature clonal B cells. The aims of this study were to gain further insights into the nature of this activation and to assess its importance for the prolonged HC survival in this chronic disease. We show that HCs contain phosphorylated/activated p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK1/ERK2 (ERK1/2). PKC inhibitors increased the activation of p38 and JNK, but reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Moreover, PKC inhibition resulted in cell death; cell death was also observed when the activation of ERK1/2 in HCs was abrogated with an inhibitor of MEK1/2 activation. In addition to PKC, active Src kinase was also shown to be involved in the maintenance of Raf-independent ERK activation in HCs. During cell culture on a nonadherent surface, ERK phosphorylation was sustained, while phosphorylation of p38 and JNK decreased. This decrease was not observed in HCs cultured on vitronectin (VN), indicating that p38/JNK activation is probably a consequence of in vivo HC interaction with VN present in abundance in the red pulp of the spleen. Taken together, these results suggest that active p38/JNK make HCs susceptible to apoptosis, but the cells are effectively rescued by ERK activation involving constitutively active PKC and Src. These findings are relevant for the understanding of the prolonged cell survival of HCs and their selective sensitivity to some chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2036570804,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is involved in the carcinogenesis of several human cancers such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Given the consistent role of EBV in transformation and maintenance of malignant phenotype, antiviral strategies provide an attractive approach to target EBV-expressing cells. In that aim, we have tested the Cidofovir, which is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analog known to exert an antiproliferative activity in some human virus-related tumors. Here, we show that Cidofovir induces a downregulation of the EBV oncoprotein LMP1 associated with a decrease of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and an increase of the proapoptotic Bax protein in Raji (BL) and C15 (NPC) cells. Using BL cell line BL2 B95-8 (BL2 infected with the B95.8 strain of EBV), we addressed the relation between EBV genome expression and modulation of viral oncoproteins by Cidofovir and/or ionizing radiation (IR). Cidofovir was able to significantly reduce LMP1 and EBNA2 mRNA and protein expression. This effect was associated with inhibition of proliferation, stimulation of apoptosis, and decrease of Bcl-2 expression in BL2 B95.8 cells. In addition, Cidofovir enhanced the radiation-induced apoptosis and the radiosensitivity through the proteolytic cleavage of death effectors caspase-9 and -3, which was specifically induced by combined treatment in EBV-positive cells compared to their negative counterparts. Furthermore, the combined treatment in nude mice led to a complete tumor remission without increasing toxicity in two human EBV-related cancer xenografts (Raji and C15). These results provide the basis for a novel anticancer strategy to enhance the therapeutic ratio of IR in EBV-related cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2072162504,"In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of CD44 ligation with the anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody A3D8 to inhibit the proliferation of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The effects of A3D8 on myeloid cells were associated with specific disruption of cell cycle events and induction of G0/G1 arrest. Induction of G0/G1 arrest was accompanied by an increase in the expression of p21, attenuation of pRb phosphorylation and associated with decreased Cdk2 and Cdk4 kinase activities. Since c-Jun is an important regulator of proliferation and cell cycle progression, we analysed its role in A3D8-mediated growth arrest. We observed that A3D8 treatment of AML patient blasts and HL60/U937 cells led to the downregulation of c-Jun expression at mRNA and protein level. Transient transfection studies showed the inhibition of c-jun promoter activity by A3D8, involving both AP-1 sites. Furthermore, A3D8 treatment caused a decrease in JNK protein expression and a decrease in the level of phosphorylated c-Jun. Ectopic overexpression of c-Jun in HL60 cells was able to induce proliferation and prevent the antiproliferative effects of A3D8. In summary, these data identify an important functional role of c-Jun in the induction of cell cycle arrest and proliferation arrest of myeloid leukemia cells because of the ligation of the cell surface adhesion receptor CD44 by anti-CD44 antibody. Moreover, targeting of G1 regulatory proteins and the resulting induction of G1 arrest by A3D8 may provide new insights into antiproliferative and differentiation therapy of AML."
https://openalex.org/W2619003102,"Other routes of infection are not the dominant contributor to the African epidemic. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa continues to grow at an alarming rate, with 3.5 million people infected last year alone1. It has recently been proposed that heterosexual transmission cannot account for more than 35% of HIV incidence in this region, and that parenteral transmission, probably through unsterile medical practices, is the main route of infection2. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that the epidemic history of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is similar to that of other blood-borne pathogens. To test this, we compared prevalence estimates of HIV with those of hepatitis C virus (HCV), which has a far greater rate of parenteral than sexual transmission. We show that HIV and HCV have such different epidemic histories in sub-Saharan Africa that parenteral transmission is unlikely to be the main source of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2012412453,"Ionotropic glutamate receptor (GluR) expression and function is regulated through multiple pre- and post-translational mechanisms. We find that limited proteolytic cleavage of GluR3 at two distinct sites generates stable GluR3 short forms that are glycosylated and found in association with other full-length GluRs in the mouse brain and cultured primary neurons. A combination of mutagenesis and transfection into HEK293 cells revealed cleavage by a γ-secretase-like activity within the membrane-localized re-entry loop at or near the leucine-glycine pair (amino acids 585–586, GluR3sβ) and a second site within a proline-rich PEST-like sequence in the first cytoplasmic loop (Asp570-Pro571, GluR3sα). Generation of the prominent GluR3sα form was effectively abolished in the mutant, GluR3D570A, but inhibitors of lysosomes, the proteasome, caspases, or calpains had no effect. The possible impact of cleavage on receptor function was suggested when the co-expression of the GluR3P571Stop mutant (creating GluR3sα) co-assembled with other GluR subunits and decreased receptor function in Xenopus oocytes. In transiently transfected HEK293 cells, co-expression of GluR3sα alters the relative association between GluR1 and GluR3 during assembly, and the presence of the novel C-terminal proline-rich domain of GluR3sα imparts lateral membrane mobility to GluR complexes. These results suggest that limited proteolysis is another post-translational mechanism through which functional diversity and specialization between closely related GluR subunits is accomplished.

Neurons continually modify the relative expression, function, and subcellular localization of neurotransmitter receptors to maintain and fine-tune neurotransmission.

Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61Google Scholar) where pre- and post-translational modifications range from RNA editing and alternative splicing to varied glycosylation (2Standley S. Baudry M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1508-1516Google Scholar) and phosphorylation (3Swope S.L. Moss S.I. Raymond L.A. Huganir R.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 49-78Google Scholar). In addition, contained within the sequences of these subunits are amino acid motifs that can impart conditional functions including association with cellular proteins that govern appropriate sub-neuronal transport and localization (4O'Brien R.J. Lau L.F. Huganir R.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 364-369Google Scholar, 5Tomita S. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: F19-F24Google Scholar). Proteolysis is another cellular mechanism for adjusting protein concentration and function. In particular, limited proteolysis through cleavage of the polypeptide at unique amino acid sequences affords a mechanism to impart distinctive functional differences between otherwise closely related proteins (6Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Google Scholar, 7Nunan J. Small D.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 6-10Google Scholar). This mechanism appears operational on GluR members. For example, GluR1 is susceptible to activity-dependent limited proteolysis by a caspase 8-like protease in the C-terminal domain at sequence VSQD (residues 862–865, Ref. 8Meyer E.L. Gahring L.C. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10869-10875Google Scholar) that removes from the subunit sequences important for binding to cell substructure and subcellular localization (e.g. Ref. 9Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Google Scholar). In addition, GluR3 harbors a sequence in the first extracellular domain that exhibits glycosylation-sensitive susceptibility to cleavage by the serine protease, granzyme B (10Gahring L. Carlson N.G. Meyer E.L. Rogers S.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1433-1438Google Scholar). Numerous sequence motifs that signal either direct sensitivity to proteolysis, or entry into degradation pathways have been identified (11Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Google Scholar). One of these, termed a PEST sequence (defined as polypeptide regions enriched for proline (P), glutamic acid (E, also aspartic acid, D), serine (S), and threonine (T) that are usually flanked by basic residues) is correlated with targeting proteins for rapid and often highly conditional site-specific cleavage or complete destruction (11Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Google Scholar, 12Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Google Scholar). Nontraditional PEST sequences may also occur at the N or C terminus of proteins, or possibly at or near boundaries of the polypeptide with membranes where these cytoplasmic domains are initiated or terminated (11Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Google Scholar). Here, we report that GluR3 is the substrate for limited cleavage by two distinct and independent proteolytic activities, the principal cleavage occurring at an aspartic acid-proline pair within a cytoplasmic-localized proline-rich PEST-like sequence. A second cleavage by a γ-secretase/presenilin 1-related activity at or near a leucine-glycine pair occurs within the membrane re-entry loop that is proposed to construct the pore-forming domain. Both proteolytic activities generate GluR3 short forms that are glycosylated and in stable association with other GluR subunits throughout the murine brain and in primary cultured cortical neurons. Notably, cleavage appears to be an intrinsic protein feature because the introduction of GluR3 cDNA into HEK293 cells by transient transfection or cRNA injection into Xenopus oocytes results in the generation of both GluR3 short protein forms observed in animal or cultured cell systems. Blocking the generation of the principal GluR3 form through modification of the proteolytic requirement of the aspartic acid to an alanine (GluR3D570A) to inhibit cleavage within the PEST-like sequence corresponds with enhanced amplitude of response to kainic acid relative to wild-type GluR3 when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. From these data we propose that GluRs contain multiple intrinsic signals for conditional modification by limited proteolysis, and these events contribute to subunit-specific modification of GluR function and expression. Animal Tissues and Cell Culture—C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Hippocampus, cortex (with some underlying basal ganglia), and cerebellum were dissected and solubilized for protein detection via Western blot analysis.

The mammalian expression vector used was pcDNA1/AMP (Invitrogen). In some cases, stably transfected colonies were selected using G418 (geneticin, Invitrogen). Limited dilutions were made to ensure the stable cell lines were clonal. Stable expression was confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies to both the N and C terminus of the protein. For experiments using varied temperature, HEK293 cells were transfected and maintained at 37 °C for ∼12 h prior to moving them to a cell culture incubator kept at a different temperature at 5% CO2.

The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to kit instructions to produce mutations in the BamH1 to SalI fragment of GluR3 in pSP72. The mutated cassette was confirmed by automated sequencing (Sequencing Core facility, University of Utah) and then returned to GluR3 wild-type from which the corresponding BamH1-SalI fragment was removed. GluR subunits were subcloned into the mammalian expression vectors pcDNA1/AMP or pCDNA3.1 (both from Invitrogen) or into the RNA expression vector psGEM (a generous gift from Michael Hollmann).

Immunol. 2001; 166: 1433-1438Google Scholar), mouse mAb 3A11, to GluR2 (Chemicon), rabbit anti-GluR1 polyclonal antibody from Oncogene, mouse and goat anti-presenilin1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-β-amyloid (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). All secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Transfected HEK293 cells were washed with PBS and dissolved with the aid of a glass Dounce homogenizer in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (4 mm), iodoacetamide (10 mm), benzamidine (10 mm), and EDTA (10 mm), all freshly prepared). Solubilized cells were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant dispensed to tubes with the appropriate antibody. The samples were rocked with antibody overnight at 4 °C, and then an additional hour at room temperature the following day. Protein-G-Sepharose beads were then added to each sample, and the tubes were rocked for an additional hour. The bead samples were then sedimented at high speed in a microcentrifuge, washed twice with RIPA buffer not containing Triton X-100, and placed in gel-loading buffer. These samples were boiled for 15 min, subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For immunoprecipitation of presenilin 1, RIPA was replaced with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5 (16Pack-Chung E. Meyers M.B. Pettingell W.P. Moir R.D. Brownawell A.M. Cheng I. Tanzi R.E. Kim T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14440-14445Google Scholar). The Triton X-100 and bovine serum albumin were omitted during the bead-washing step. A 1:1 mixture of protein A and protein G beads was used to precipitate presenilin 1. Western Blot Analysis and Immunocytochemistry—Western blots were performed as described previously (8Meyer E.L. Gahring L.C. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10869-10875Google Scholar, 10Gahring L. Carlson N.G. Meyer E.L. Rogers S.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1433-1438Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were harvested in immunoprecipitation buffer and mixed with 2× gelloading buffer containing dithiothreitol before boiling for 10–15 min followed by SDS-PAGE fractionation and transfer to nitrocellulose (10Gahring L. Carlson N.G. Meyer E.L. Rogers S.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1433-1438Google Scholar). Blots were blocked at room temperature for at least 1 h in PBS containing 5% dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with slow agitation in primary antibody added to blocking solution. Blots were washed in successive changes of PBS-T and then incubated for 1 h in blocking solution containing peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were again washed with PBS-T and the bands detected on film after developing with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were scanned and overlaid to compare the band sizes. Immunocytochemistry was done as in Ref. 8Meyer E.L. Gahring L.C. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10869-10875Google Scholar. Electrophysiology—The full-length rat GluR3 cDNA and sequences modified as noted above were subcloned into the RNA expression vector, psGEM (from M. Hollmann). Xenopus oocytes were surgically removed and injected with 5 or 10 ng of cRNA that was synthesized using the Ambion kit for transcription in vitro. Yield and quantitation of injected RNA was measured using the RiboGreen RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes). Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed by superfusion with kainic acid (300 μm) prepared in amphibian Ringer's solution. Oocytes were held at –70 mV, and the agonist was applied for 10–20 s at a flow rate of 10–14 ml/min. Photobleaching Recovery Experiments—For photobleaching, transfected HEK293 cells grown on glass coverslips treated with polylysine were transferred to a live-cell chamber (30 °C) in Hanks' with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and no phenol red and then visualized with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 and Attoarc mercury lamp. A target cell was photographed and the mercury lamp light path was narrowed to a target beam of 2-μm diameter and power increased to 100 watts for ∼1 min to quench the CFP. The power was returned to 25 watts, the iris opened, and photographs were taken at 30-s intervals for 7–10 min thereafter. Reagents—γ-Secretase inhibitor was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. Caspase and calpain inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem, Alexis Biochemicals, or Enzyme Systems Products. The metalloprotease inhibitor, KB8301, was from BD PharMingen and the inhibitors of ADAM proteases from Alexis Biochemicals. DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England BioLabs, Invitrogen, Promega, or Fermentas. Protein-G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences and protein A beads from BioRad. All other reagents/drugs were from RBI/Sigma unless otherwise noted. Antibodies used include the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to GluR3, mAb2F5 (10Gahring L. Carlson N.G. Meyer E.L. Rogers S.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1433-1438Google Scholar), mouse mAb3A11, to GluR2 (Chemicon), rabbit anti-GluR3 polyclonals 295, and 5209 (Carlson et al., Ref. 19Carlson N.G. Gahring L.C. Twyman R.E. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11295-11301Google Scholar), rabbit anti-GluR1 polyclonal antibody from Oncogene, mouse and goat anti-presenilin1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-β-amyloid (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). All secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Western blot analysis of mouse brain tissue using antibodies prepared to AMPA family GluR subunits revealed two major reactive glycosylated species including the full-length GluR3 (∼110 kDa) and a more rapidly migrating species at approximately ∼72 kDa termed the GluR3 short form (Fig. 1). Similar fragments were not observed for GluR1 or GluR2 (Fig. 1A). The GluR3s nomenclature was selected to distinguish this R3 short form from a previously reported splice-variant found in cochlear cells (termed short-GluR3′) that deletes 33 amino acids near the C terminus within the ligand-binding region of the S2 extracellular domain (17Sekiguchi M. Doi K. Zhu W.S. Watase K. Yokotani N. Wada K. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14559-14565Google Scholar). To determine if GluR3s forms associate with other GluR subunits, detergent-solubilized membranes prepared from different brain regions of the C57BL/6 mouse were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either antibodies to GluR1 (Chemicon) or GluR2 (18Siegel S.J. Janssen W.G. Tullai J.W. Rogers S.W. Moran T. Heinemann S.F. Morrison J.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2707-2719Google Scholar, 19Carlson N.G. Gahring L.C. Twyman R.E. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11295-11301Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate using a monoclonal antibody specific for GluR3 (mAb2F5, which binds to the extracellular region near the S1 domain, Ref. 10Gahring L. Carlson N.G. Meyer E.L. Rogers S.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1433-1438Google Scholar) revealed that both full-length GluR3 and GluR3s co-precipitated with either GluR1 or GluR2 in preparations from throughout the mouse brain (Fig. 1B). Also apparent on Western blots of immunoprecipitates was the clear distinction of two closely migrating GluR3s forms that differ in mobility by 1.8 kDa (termed GluR3s α or β as in Fig. 1B). To assure the fidelity of co-precipitation, two experiments were done. First, cDNAs encoding GluR1 and GluR3, respectively, were translated either individually or together in vitro using rabbit reticulocytes supplemented with canine microsomes. These lysates were solubilized in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitation performed as for membranes from intact tissues (see “Experimental Procedures”). Anti-GluR1 failed to co-immunoprecipitate GluR3 as determined by subsequent analysis on Western blots (not shown). Further, only full-length GluR3 was observed in lysate preparations suggesting this post-translational processing to generate GluR3s forms does not occur in reticulocyte lysates (not shown). The second method to assure co-precipitation fidelity was to transiently transfect HEK293 cells with cDNAs encoding either GluR1 or GluR3, and then mixing these independently transfected cells before preparing cell lysates by solubilization in RIPA buffer and subsequent immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses. Similar to the results from translation in vitro, despite the presence of readily detectable GluR1 and GluR3 (full-length and short forms), no GluR3 was detected to co-precipitate with GluR1 (not shown). These experiments indicate that association between these respective subunits was not an artifact of immunoprecipitation conditions. To determine if GluR3s forms were glycosylated, immunoprecipitates of GluR3 from hippocampal membranes were subjected to deglycosylation using N-glycosidase-F, an enzyme that removes all asparagine-linked glycosylations. As shown in Fig. 1C, there was an increase in mobility of full-length GluR3 and both GluR3s forms proportional to complete deglycosylation (see Ref. 10Gahring L. Carlson N.G. Meyer E.L. Rogers S.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1433-1438Google Scholar). The same fragments were identified on Western blots prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with GluR3 cDNA (Fig. 1C) confirming the origin of these species to be from the GluR3 cDNA. Further, deglycosylation of this preparation resulted in changed migration of all forms of GluR3 proportional to equivalent glycosylation (Fig. 1C). The gels shown were selected for clarity of the appearance of both GluR3s forms. However, regardless of the protein source (transfected cells, brain tissue, or cultured neurons (not shown)), it is most typical for the GluR3sα to be prevalent and in many preparations GluR3sβ can be difficult to detect (see below). Inclusion of multiple protease inhibitors during all aspects of sample preparation had no effect on the incidence of GluR3s forms (not shown). Collectively, these results show that GluR3 short forms are present in preparations taken from various mouse brain regions and that these glycosylated forms are present in association with GluR1 and GluR2. Further, the generation of GluR3s forms do not occur when cDNA encoding GluR3 is translated in cell-free systems; however, upon introduction by transfection into cultured HEK293 cells, in addition to full-length GluR3 both GluR3s forms are observed, and they are glycosylated equivalently to the same species recovered from mouse brain suggesting their source is the result of a post-translational cell process. Limited Proteolysis of GluR3 Produces Short Forms—Based upon the predicted molecular weight of the GluR3s forms, the likely site of GluR3s termination(s) was within the cytoplasmic domain between transmembrane 1 and the pore-forming re-entry loop (Fig. 2; see Ref. 1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61Google Scholar). In this region the GluR3 sequence is rich in prolines and acidic amino acids (Fig. 2A) that collectively resemble a PEST sequence (residues 564–575). Because GluR2 lacks detectable short fragments and the GluR2 sequence differs from GluR3 in the first cytoplasmic loop region, chimeras between these homologous regions were generated and expressed transiently in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). In all cases chimeras that disrupted GluR3Asp570 failed to generate GluR3sα; however, GluR3sβ was unaffected by the chimeras tested suggesting that GluR3sα and GluR3sβ are produced by distinct mechanisms and at different sites. Alanine mutagenesis confirmed the importance of GluR3Asp570 for generating GluR3sα since its production was effectively abolished when GluR3D570A was expressed in transfected cells (Fig. 2B). However, in some experiments (below), a light smear migrating at approximately this molecular weight was evident suggesting that additional minor fragments are revealed when GluR3sα is absent or that weak proteolysis of GluR3 in the same vicinity of GluR3D570A persists. GluR3 Is a Substrate of γ-Secretase and Associates with Presenilin 1—To identify the protease that cleaves at GluR3Asp570, attempts to inhibit this activity with a broad range of protease inhibitors toward caspases (based upon the requirement for GluR3Asp570, see also Refs. 8Meyer E.L. Gahring L.C. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10869-10875Google Scholar and 20Stennicke H.R. Renatus M. Meldal M. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 563-568Google Scholar, calpains, lysosomal proteases, and the proteasome/cathepsin A (see Fig. 2C) as well as inhibitors of proline-endopeptidases, metalloproteases, ADAMS, and modulators of SREBP proteolytic activities, were tested without effect (not shown). However, it was observed that a state-dependent inhibitor of γ-secretase (21Moore C.L. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 197-205Google Scholar) effectively and specifically abolished the formation of GluR3sβ (Fig. 2C). The inability to inhibit the formation of GluR3sα could have several explanations. For example, inhibitors of the responsible protease may not reach sufficient intracellular concentration to inhibit the cleavage. This is particularly true for peptide inhibitors that often cross the membrane relatively poorly and could themselves be substrates for proteolysis resulting in reduced efficacy. Of course, a proteolytic activity other than those tested for in these assays is certainly possible since it is likely that a multitude of cellular proteases, whose identities and novel subcellular localizations and function, remain to be determined. The inhibition of γ-secretase had no effect on the generation of GluR3sα in cells transfected with GluR3 (Figs. 2C and 3A). Notably, when cells were transfected with the GluR3D570A construct in the presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor, both GluR3s forms were effectively abolished (Fig. 3A). The efficacy of the γ-secretase inhibitor was confirmed by demonstrating inhibition of β-amyloid processing (Fig. 3A). Again, these data are consistent with the independent origin of the respective GluRs forms. Attempts to treat cultured neurons with this inhibitor were not successful due to apparent toxicity (not shown). Because γ-secretase activity is related to presenilins (22Sisodia S.S. Annaert W. Kim S.H. De Strooper B. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: S2-S6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), we determined if presenilin1 (PS1) associates with GluR3. To test this, HEK293 cells stably expressing GluR3 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a PS1 monoclonal antibody and the immunoprecipitate probed on Western blots with anti-GluR3 (Fig. 3B). In this assay a unique band corresponding with full-length GluR3 (GluR3s forms were not detected in association with PS1) was revealed suggesting a relatively stable co-association between these respective proteins. Similar experiments on cells transfected with GluR1 indicated little or no co-precipitated GluR1 signal (not shown), nor did GluR3 co-precipitate when antibodies to presenilin2 were used (not shown). Double-label immunocytochemistry of cultured primary neurons using goat anti-PS1 and rabbit anti-GluR3 showed these proteins co-localized in the soma, particularly in perinuclear regions consistent with endoplasmic reticulum and in dispersed structures similar to elements of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3C). PS1 immunostaining in neuronal processes was weak and at this level of detection does not necessarily colocalize with GluR3 in the dendrite (Fig. 3C). Further, as shown in the neuron in Fig. 3C, the generally good agreement between PS1 and GluR3 immunostaining, particularly in the more dispersed structures in the soma is consistent with the localization of PS1 reported by others (23Lah J.J. Heilman C.J. Nash N.R. Rees H.D. Yi H. Counts S.E. Levey A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1971-1980Google Scholar). Confirmation that inhibition of γ-secretase in cultured neurons eliminated GluR3sβ formation was not successful due to the toxicity of the inhibitor under the multiple conditions attempted. Because γ-secretase/PS1 proteolytic activity is membrane-associated and co-localized with GluR3 in compartments throughout the soma, it was necessary to determine whether membrane fluidity and/or vesicular transport was required for GluR3sβ cleavage. To do this HEK293 cells were transfected with GluR3 cDNA, maintained at 37 °C for ∼12 h, and then cultures were placed at six temperatures ranging from 7 to 37 °C thereafter before immunoprecipitating Glu"

An inhibitory peptide (PMTLEYR) derived from the third domain of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor and optimized for specific porcine pancreatic elastase inhibition was introduced into an inhibitor scaffold to increase the proteolytic stability of the peptide. The trypsin-specific squash inhibitor EETI II from Ecballium elaterium was chosen as the scaffold. The resulting hybrid inhibitor HEI-TOE I (hybrid inhibitor from E. elaterium and the optimized binding loop of the third domain of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor) shows a specificity and affinity to porcine pancreatic elastase similar to the free inhibitory peptide but with significantly higher proteolytic stability. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that elastase binding of HEI-TOE I occurs with a small unfavorable positive enthalpy contribution, a large favorable positive entropy change, and a large negative heat capacity change. In addition, the inhibitory peptide and the hybrid inhibitor HEI-TOE I protected endothelial cells against degradation following treatment with porcine pancreatic elastase.

Proteases can play a decisive role as indirect virulence factors promoting infection by viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Moreover, inappropriate or altered host protease activities are involved in many diseases, such as cancer, blood clotting, Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, arteriosclerosis, and pulmonary emphysema. Consequently protease inhibitors have a huge potential as therapeutic tools for treating any number of diverse diseases (1Helm K.v.d. Korant B.D. Cheronis J.C. Born G.V.R. Cuatrecasas P. Ganten D. Herken H. Starke K. Taylor P. Berlin Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2000Google Scholar). A well known example is the generation of protease inhibitors against human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, protease (1Helm K.v.d. Korant B.D. Cheronis J.C. Born G.V.R. Cuatrecasas P. Ganten D. Herken H. Starke K. Taylor P. Berlin Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2000Google Scholar). However, for each individual indication major efforts are required to find the appropriate specific, effective, stable, and non-toxic protease inhibitor. Apart from this, investigating inhibitor/protease interactions leads to a better understanding of protein molecular recognition and specificity in general.There are different methods and strategies to develop an inhibitor for a given protease. Previously, we described a method for characterizing and optimizing peptide inhibitor/protease interactions using cellulose-bound peptides (2Hilpert K. Hansen G. Wessner H. Schneider-Mergener J. Hohne W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 1051-1057Google Scholar). We demonstrated an optimization process for a 9-mer peptide originating from the third domain of the turkey ovomucoid inhibitor, OMTKY3. 1The abbreviations used are: OMTKY3, third domain of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor; EETI, trypsin inhibitor from E. elaterium; HEI-TOE, hybrid inhibitor from E. elaterium and the optimized binding loop of the third domain of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor; PPE, porcine pancreatic elastase; MCEI, elastase inhibitor from M. charantia; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HLE, human leucozyte elastase; HUVEC, human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells; BPC, bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin; BPT, bovine pancreatic trypsin; ASA, accessible surface area; Suc, succinyl; pNA, p-nitroanilide; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: OMTKY3, third domain of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor; EETI, trypsin inhibitor from E. elaterium; HEI-TOE, hybrid inhibitor from E. elaterium and the optimized binding loop of the third domain of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor; PPE, porcine pancreatic elastase; MCEI, elastase inhibitor from M. charantia; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HLE, human leucozyte elastase; HUVEC, human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells; BPC, bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin; BPT, bovine pancreatic trypsin; ASA, accessible surface area; Suc, succinyl; pNA, p-nitroanilide; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. This 56-amino acid protein strongly inhibits a broad spectrum of serine proteases, e.g. bovine α-chymotrypsin with a Ki = 5.5 × 10–12m (3Bigler T.L. Lu W. Park S.J. Tashiro M. Wieczorek M. Wynn R. Laskowski Jr., M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 786-799Google Scholar). The peptide from the binding loop of OMTKY3 was optimized against porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE, EC 3.4.21.36). This 240-amino acid enzyme is a member of the S1 class of serine proteases. Its active site comprises eight subsites (S5–S3′; according to the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (4Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar)) and cleaves the amide bond of amino acids with small hydrophobic side chains (5Bieth J.G. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner Jr., F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 42Google Scholar). Our optimization procedure led to a 7-mer peptide (PMTLEYR), which although showing a high specificity and affinity toward PPE, turned out to be unstable against proteolytic degradation by PPE. For more detailed investigation of the inhibitor/PPE interaction, e.g. by x-ray structural and biophysical analysis of corresponding complexes, as well as for medical applications, high proteolytic stability is an important prerequisite. One possible way to create a more stable inhibitor molecule is to introduce the inhibitory peptide sequence into a stable scaffold. Such scaffolds are provided by the squash-type inhibitors.Squash-type inhibitors are natural serine protease inhibitors occurring in plant seeds of Curcubitaceae. They consist of only ∼30 amino acids and have a rigid and stable structure cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. They are resistant to proteolytic cleavage and stable at elevated temperatures (for review, see Ref. 6Otlewski J. Krowarsch D. Biochemistry. 1996; 43: 431-444Google Scholar). EETI II from the squirting cucumber Ecballium elaterium is a well characterized squash-type inhibitor with a high affinity and specificity for trypsin (Kd of 1.2 × 10–12m) (7Favel A. Mattras H. Coletti-Previero M.A. Zwilling R. Robinson E.A. Castro B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1989; 33: 202-208Google Scholar). It was shown to fold into its native structure even if considerable amino acid exchanges and length variations are incorporated within its binding loop (8Wentzel A. Christmann A. Kratzner R. Kolmar H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21037-21043Google Scholar). Natural squash inhibitors that inhibit porcine pancreatic elastase are also known from the literature. The inhibitors MCEI I (9Hara S. Makino J. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 88-91Google Scholar) and MCEI II, III, and IV (10Hamato N. Koshiba T. Pham T.N. Tatsumi Y. Nakamura D. Takano R. Hayashi K. Hong Y.M. Hara S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 432-437Google Scholar) were isolated from bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) and inhibit PPE with Ki values between 9.7 × 10–7 and 4.7 × 10–9m (9Hara S. Makino J. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 88-91Google Scholar, 10Hamato N. Koshiba T. Pham T.N. Tatsumi Y. Nakamura D. Takano R. Hayashi K. Hong Y.M. Hara S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 432-437Google Scholar).We describe here the introduction of sequences, derived from the inhibitory peptide PMTLEYR, into the squash inhibitor EETI II, and the characterization of several hybrid squash inhibitor variants with respect to inhibition strength, specificity, and stability. The energetics of the inhibitor-elastase complex formation at different temperatures and in various buffer systems was studied using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, the effects of the optimized inhibitory peptide PMTLEYR and of one of the hybrid squash inhibitors (HEI-TOE I) on elastase-treated human endothelial cells were compared.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis—The peptides and squash inhibitors were synthesized in reduced form on solid phase according to standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) machine protocols using a multiple peptide synthesizer (Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany). After a purification step by reverse phase HPLC, the disulfide bridges were formed using charcoal according to a recently described cyclization protocol (11Volkmer-Engert R. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 51: 365-369Google Scholar). The degree of disulfide formation was monitored by measuring the decrease of free cysteine content with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The cyclization procedure was applied until no free cysteine was detectable. After disulfide formation another reverse phase HPLC purification step was performed. The purity of the final products was greater than 98%.Kiand Proteolytic Stability Determination—All enzymes and substrates were purchased from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). The activity of the enzymes was measured by monitoring hydrolysis of the corresponding substrates on a recording spectrophotometer model UV-160A (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany). Varying the substrate (63 μm to 2.5 mm) and inhibitor concentrations (55 nm to 1 mm) the Ki values were determined in a 200-μl assay at 25 °C. For PPE, human leukocyte elastase (HLE), and trypsin a 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.5, was used; in the case of chymotrypsin, a 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 7.5, was used. The activity of chymotrypsin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) was determined using Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany); for PPE, Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA; for HLE, Suc-Ala-Ala-Val-pNA; and for trypsin, Nα-benzoyl-dl-arginine-pNA, all solubilized in Me2SO.The proteolytic stability of the peptides was measured (determined via PPE activity) by preincubation of different inhibitor concentrations (10–500 μm) with PPE (15–150 units in 150-μl assay volume) for between 2 min and 8 days in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.5, at 25 °C.Isothermal Titration Experiments—Isothermal titrations were performed at 6.8, 11.5, 16.0 and 25 °C using a MicroCal MCS isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) as described recently (12Hahn M. Winkler D. Welfle K. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Wessner H. Zahn G. Scholz C. Seifert M. Harkins R. Schneider-Mergener J. Hohne W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 293-309Google Scholar, 13Welfle K. Misselwitz R. Sabat R. Volk H.D. Schneider-Mergener J. Reineke U. Welfle H. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 89-98Google Scholar). PPE and HEI-TOE I were dialyzed against the following buffers at pH 6.0 containing 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm PIPES, 50 mm MES, and 50 mm MOPS, which have ionization enthalpies at 7.0 °C of 11.1 kJ·mol–1, 15.2 kJ·mol–1, and 21.1 kJ·mol–1, respectively (14Fukada H. Takahashi K. Proteins. 1998; 33: 159-166Google Scholar). The ionization enthalpies at different temperatures were calculated using a heat capacity change, ΔCp0, of 0.019 kJ·mol–1·K–1 for PIPES (14Fukada H. Takahashi K. Proteins. 1998; 33: 159-166Google Scholar). The concentrations of PPE and HEI-TOE I were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 and 276 nm, respectively, using extinction coefficients of 5.2 × 104m–1·cm–1 (15Shotton D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 113-140Google Scholar) and 1.885 × 103m–1·cm–1 (calculated from the amino acid composition according to Gill and von Hippel (16Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar)). In a typical titration experiment 5 μl of HEI-TOE I solution (around 560 μm) were titrated into 1.4 ml of PPE solution (around 12 μm). The experimental raw data were corrected by subtraction of the heat of dilution of the peptide, transformed into kJ·mol–1 of injectant, then fitted to a model of identical and independent binding sites using the ORIGIN software package provided with the calorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). Enthalpy changes, ΔHbind0, of complex formation were determined by correction of experimentally estimated enthalpy changes, ΔHexp0, for ΔHion0 of the respective buffer.The total entropy ΔStot0 can be dissected according to Equation 1, ΔStot0=ΔSsolv0+ΔSconf0+ΔSrt0(Eq. 1) in terms of the main contributions of solvation entropy, ΔSsolv0, conformational entropy, ΔSconf0, and translational and rotational entropy, ΔSrt0. The value of ΔSrt0 is debated in the literature and here ΔSrt0=−33 J·mol–1·K–1 was taken, which is close to the cratic entropy (17Lavigne P. Bagu J.R. Boyko R. Willard L. Holmes C.F. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 252-264Google Scholar). Change of the solvation entropy, ΔSsolv0, was calculated according to Equation 2, ΔSsolv0(T)=ΔCp·ln(T/T0*)(Eq. 2) where T is the temperature in Kelvin, ΔT0=385 K is the reference temperature where ΔSsolv0(ΔT0) is zero (18Baker B.M. Murphy K.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 294-315Google Scholar) and ΔCp is the heat capacity change.Entropic contributions of the hydrophobic effect ( ΔSHE0) to HEI-TOE I-PPE binding were calculated according to Equation 3 (19Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Google Scholar), ΔSHE0(T)=0.32·ΔAnp·ln(T/386)(Eq. 3) where ΔAnp is in Å2, T is in degrees Kelvin, and ΔSHE0(T) is in entropy units (e.u. or cal·mol–1·K–1). Ts is the temperature where ΔS0 is zero and was calculated according to Equation 4, ln Ts=−ΔS0/ΔCp+ln T (eq. 4) with the experimental values ΔStot0=150 J·mol–1·K–1 at 298 K and ΔCp,exp = –1.275 kJ·mol–1·K–1. At Ts the entropy changes from the hydrophobic effect ΔSHE0 and from any other entropic contribution ΔSother0 despite ΔSHE0 add to zero. ΔS0(Ts)=0=ΔSHE0(Ts)+ΔSother0(Eq. 5) Polar (ΔASAp) and nonpolar (ΔASAnp) buried surface areas were calculated according to Refs. 20Murphy K.P. Freire E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 313-361Google Scholar and 21Xie D. Freire E. Proteins. 1994; 19: 291-301Google Scholar by means of empirical Equations 6, 7, 8, ΔCp=a·ΔASAnp+b·ΔASAp(Eq. 1) ΔH0(T)=ΔH0(60 °C)+ΔCp(T−60 °C)(Eq. 7) ΔH0(60 °C)=c·ΔASAnp+d·ΔASAp(Eq. 8) where T is in °C, a = 1.88 J·K–1·mol–1·Å–2, b = –1.09 J·K–1·mol–1·Å–2, c = –35.3 J·mol–1·Å–2, and d = 131 J·mol–1·Å–2.Buried surface areas used for thermodynamic calculations were obtained from atomic coordinates of elastase-HEI-TOE I complex (Protein Data Bank code 1mcv, adapted for the calculations) with program CALCASA of the program suite STC (structure-based thermodynamic calculations) (17Lavigne P. Bagu J.R. Boyko R. Willard L. Holmes C.F. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 252-264Google Scholar). In CALCASA is implemented the Lee and Richards algorithm (22Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Google Scholar); probe radius and slice widths are 1.4 and 0.25 Å, respectively. Identical structures for both PPE and HEI-TOE I were assumed in the complex and in free form. The program suite STC sums up to ΔSconf0 the individual contributions of all residues buried in the complex. Program THERMO of the STC suite calculates thermodynamic parameters ΔCp,calc, ΔHcalc0, ΔGcalc0, and dissociation constant Kd (17Lavigne P. Bagu J.R. Boyko R. Willard L. Holmes C.F. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 252-264Google Scholar). THERMO provides the possibility to vary arbitrarily the value for ΔSconf0 and thus to achieve apparent but meaningless agreement of experimental and calculated ΔG0.Preparation of Human Endothelial Cells and F-actin Staining— Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from umbilical cord veins and identified as described previously (23Hippenstiel S. Soeth S. Kellas B. Fuhrmann O. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Goebeler M. Ludwig S. Suttorp N. Blood. 2000; 95: 3044-3051Google Scholar). Briefly, cells obtained from collagenase digestion were washed, resuspended, cultivated in MCDB 131, 10% fetal calf serum, and seeded onto 24-well Thermanox® slides (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) (23Hippenstiel S. Soeth S. Kellas B. Fuhrmann O. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Goebeler M. Ludwig S. Suttorp N. Blood. 2000; 95: 3044-3051Google Scholar, 24Hippenstiel S. Witzenrath M. Schmeck B. Hocke A. Krisp M. Krull M. Seybold J. Seeger W. Rascher W. Schutte H. Suttorp N. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 618-625Google Scholar). Studies were performed using confluent endothelial cell monolayers in their second passage. For the investigations with the protease inhibitors human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were incubated with 0.5 unit of PPE for 1 h. HUVEC were grown on Thermanox® slides. After stimulation, slides were fixed for 1 h in 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Permeabilization of cell membranes was performed using 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min followed by three wash steps with phosphate-buffered saline. F-actin was stained with phalloidin Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (1:400) as described previously (24Hippenstiel S. Witzenrath M. Schmeck B. Hocke A. Krisp M. Krull M. Seybold J. Seeger W. Rascher W. Schutte H. Suttorp N. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 618-625Google Scholar). Thermanox® slides were placed on glass slides and embedded with Gelmount mounting media (Biomeda). Slides were analyzed using a Pascal 5 confocal scanning laser microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an air-cooled argon laser (Axioskop 2 Mot microscope, Zeiss). Alexa 488 fluorescence was excited with a 488-nm argon-ion laser beam and imaged using a NT80/20/488 beamsplitter and a 505-nm longpass emission filter. All images were recorded with a 40 × 1.3 NA Plan-Apochromat III DIC objective with image resolution 1024 × 1024 pixels.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRational Design of Hybrid Squash Inhibitors—The binding loop of squash inhibitor EETI II is located at the N terminus of the miniprotein and is stabilized by two cysteine bonds (see Fig. 1 for the corresponding sequences). Two different strategies were used to insert the inhibitory peptide into this binding loop. First, the inhibitory peptide was introduced in such a way that its P1 position (according to the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (4Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar), the main specificity-determining amino acid residue adjacent to the scissile peptide bond of a peptide or polypeptide substrate) Leu-4 resembled that of the original squash inhibitor EETI II. Also, to maintain the important disulfide bridges, the sequence of the inhibitory peptide PMTLEYR was modified in position 2 to PCTLEYR. Furthermore, to avoid problems with an adjacent positive charge, and since a substitution for methionine is possible without decreasing inhibition (2Hilpert K. Hansen G. Wessner H. Schneider-Mergener J. Hohne W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 1051-1057Google Scholar, 8Wentzel A. Christmann A. Kratzner R. Kolmar H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21037-21043Google Scholar), the Arg-7 was changed to methionine, a conserved position in most squash inhibitors. This inhibitor with the N-terminal sequence now reading PCTLEYM (see Fig. 1) was called HEI-TOE I: hybrid elastase inhibitor-turkey ovomucoid E. elaterium.In the second strategy, the optimized peptide was inserted between the two cysteine residues of the squash inhibitor N-terminal binding loop. Christmann et al. (25Christmann A. Walter K. Wentzel A. Kratzner R. Kolmar H. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 797-806Google Scholar) showed that it is possible to replace the six residues of this loop by a 17-residue epitope from human bone Gla protein. This EETI II variant was fully oxidized and correctly folded, and the epitope inserted into the binding loop was readily recognized by a monoclonal antibody (25Christmann A. Walter K. Wentzel A. Kratzner R. Kolmar H. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 797-806Google Scholar). We inserted the optimized peptide into the binding loop in the same way, creating the variant HEI-TOE II (Fig. 1).Both hybrid squash inhibitors were synthesized, purified, and oxidized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inhibition of PPE activity was measured during the course of disulfide bridge formation. Interestingly, HEI-TOE I and II showed opposing behaviors. Whereas PPE inhibition by HEI-TOE I increases during disulfide formation it decreases for HEI-TOE II (Fig. 2A). To verify these data, the Ki values for HEI-TOE I and II were determined before disulfide formation, after disulfide formation and after a subsequent second purification step to eliminate improperly folded or cross-reacting species. For comparison, the Ki values for the free peptides corresponding to the binding loop of the two hybrid squash variants were included (Fig. 2B and Table I). The data confirmed that only the inhibitor HEI-TOE I, with the P1 site position conserved within the structure, inhibits PPE strongly after folding and disulfide formation is finished. We cannot exclude that non-native disulfide bonds are predominantly formed with HEI-TOE II, resulting in the decreased inhibition strength of this inhibitor variant, but more likely, the decreasing inhibitory strength during the formation of disulfide bridges reflects structural restrictions imposed on the PPE-interacting loop region.Fig. 2A, determination of the inhibition of PPE activity at different times during the cyclization process of the inhibitors. ○ is the symbol of HEI-TOE I, • represents HEI-TOE II, and ▪ is the symbol of the peptide PMTLEYR.

Open table in a new tab The natural elastase-specific squash inhibitors MCEI I–IV differ only in N-terminal additions of glutamic acid residues: MCEI I has no Glu at the N terminus, but MCEI IV has three (see Fig. 1). This correlates directly with considerable differences in their affinity, where the inhibition strength of MCEI III is 240-fold higher than that of MCEI I (10Hamato N. Koshiba T. Pham T.N. Tatsumi Y. Nakamura D. Takano R. Hayashi K. Hong Y.M. Hara S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 432-437Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of those Glu residues on our hybrid squash inhibitor, we added the three N-terminal residues of MCEI III (EER) to our sequence (Fig. 1, HEI-TOE III). This variant indeed showed increased inhibition of PPE, but only by a factor of 1.8 at pH 8.5 (Table I). Thus, the mode of interaction with PPE is apparently different for HEI-TOE III and MCEI III.Specificity and Stability of Native and Hybrid Squash Inhibitors—For comparison, Ki values for the two hybrid miniproteins HEI-TOE I and HEI-TOE II were determined with PPE and three other proteases: HLE, chymotrypsin (BPC), and trypsin (BPT) from bovine pancreas (Table I). A specificity similar to PPE has been reported for HLE (26Bode W. Meyer E.J. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1951-1963Google Scholar). BPT was chosen because EETI II, the scaffold donor, shows a high specificity toward trypsin. BPC is included because of its deviating specificity and strong inhibition by OMTKY3. HEI-TOE II did not significantly distinguish between the tested serine proteases, in contrast to HEI-TOE I, which showed high specificity for PPE. The observed PPE specificity was similar to that of the optimized peptide PMTLEYR. In fact HEI-TOE I affinity was about seven times higher than that of PMTLEYR, but 3–4 orders of magnitude lower than that of OMTKY3, which in turn showed little difference between PPE, HLE, and BPC but did not inhibit BPT at all (27Kato I. Schrode J. Kohr W.J. Laskowski Jr., M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 193-201Google Scholar). The natural squash inhibitor EETI II is highly specific for trypsin due to the Arg in position P1 of the binding loop, but, at a low affinity level, it does not distinguish between the elastases PPE and HLE. The natural inhibitor MCEI III described as an inhibitor for PPE has a low affinity against trypsin and, at high affinity level, does not distinguish between both elastases (PPE and HLE) and also chymotrypsin (see Table I). In contrast to the free peptide, the hybrid inhibitor variant HEI-TOE II containing the optimized peptide PMTLEYR directly inserted into the EETI II binding loop shows no much difference in affinity toward all proteases tested (Table I). Obviously, the distortion of peptide conformation imposed by the framework constraint occurs in such a way that important contacts, especially to PPE, cannot be established. The data also show that the substitutions leading from EETI II to the hybrid variant HEI-TOE I transform a squash inhibitor previously highly specific for trypsin into an specific inhibitor for porcine pancreatic elastase.Another feature of inhibitors is important: their stability against proteolytic cleavage, here either at the P1 position or somewhere else within structurally exposed sequence parts. OMTKY3 itself, the starting protein for our previous optimization experiments, is very stable against proteolytic attack (28Ardelt W. Laskowski M.J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1983; 30: 115-126Google Scholar). The peptide PACTLEYRP representing the binding loop of OMTKY3 was synthesized, and its stability against proteolytic cleavage was measured as a change in the degree of PPE inhibition (data not shown). The peptide undergoes rapid degradation by PPE with a half-life ranging below 1 h. This suggests that the binding sequence itself is not responsible for the high hydrolytic stability of OMTKY3 but rather the rigid structure imposed by the scaffold. The time scale for degradation of the optimized peptide PMTLEYR enters the same range as for PACTLEYRP if 10-fold more enzyme is used (data not shown). The hybrid miniprotein HEI-TOE I is clearly more stable against proteolytic attack than the free inhibiting peptides (24% residual inhibitory activity after 145 h of incubation with PPE). The time-dependent reduction of the inhibitor peptides was also ascertained by HPLC measurements (data not shown). In the case of the natural squash inhibitor MCEI III no cleavage is detectable even over 8 days. The difference between the peptides and the squash inhibitors could be explained by a lower efficiency of the acyl enzym formation for the complete miniproteins because of the rigid structure of the binding loop. In addition, it was reported that protein inhibitors with the scissile bond already cleaved can bind to the enzyme as well and thus maintain inhibition or even resynthesize the cleaved peptide bond (29Otlewski J. Zbyryt T. Dryjanski M. Bulaj G. Wilusz T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 208-213Google Scholar). HEI-TOE I binding to PPE causes small shifts of loops in the vicinity of the binding region of the protease (30Aÿ J. Hilpert K. Krauss N. Schneider-Mergener J. Höhne W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Like their counterpart protein tyrosine kinases, PTPs can be divided into transmembrane receptor-like and intracellular enzymes. The intracellular PTPs contain a single conserved phosphatase domain. Beyond the limit of the catalytic domains are various segments or domains that modulate the activity and/or intracellular localization of the enzymes. Among these is the Sec14 domain found in PTP-MEG2 (4Gu M. Warshawsky I. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2980-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The Sec14 domain is shared by several lipid-binding proteins such as cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP), α-tocopherol transfer protein, and yeast Sec14p and by regulators of G proteins including RhoGAPs, RhoGEFs and the RasGEF, and neurofibromin (5Aravind L. Neuwals A.F. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R195-R197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CRALBP is a water-soluble protein found in the retina and pineal gland. It acts as a carrier protein for 11-cis-retinaldehyde or 11-cis-retinol and modulates the interactions of these retinoids with visual cycle enzymes (6Wolf G. Nutr. Rev. 1991; 49: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). α-Tocopherol transfer protein specifically sorts out α-tocopherol from all incoming tocopherols for incorporation into plasma lipoproteins (7Sato Y. Arai H. Miyata A. Tokita S. Yamamoto K. Tanabe T. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17705-17710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sec14p acts as a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein by catalyzing the transfer of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine between membrane bilayers, and it is required for protein transport through the Golgi complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Aitken J.F. van Heusden G.P.

Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). With significant sequence homology to these lipid-binding proteins, PTP-MEG2 may also bind certain lipid molecules that may regulate its activity and/or localization. A ligand for the Sec14 domain of PTP-MEG2 has not been found. In this study, we examined the interaction of PTP-MEG2 with various known lipid molecules and demonstrated that phosphatidylserine (PS) specifically interacts with PTP-MEG2. PS is a relatively abundant membrane lipid molecule. Recently, it has been defined as an important ligand for clearance of apoptotic cells through the PS receptor (PSR) located on the surface of phagocytes (10Schlegel R.A. Williamson P.

By specifically interacting with PS, PTP-MEG2 may have an important role in regulating cell-signaling pathways in this process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Commercial PIP strips spotted with 100 pmol of 16 different phospholipids were purchased from Echelon Research Lab (Salt Lake City, UT). Individual lipid compounds including phosphatidic acid, PC, PE, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, PS, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol, all from natural sources, were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Aranchidonic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, all-trans-retinal, and α-tocopherol were from Sigma. A mixture of retinal isomers was made by photoisomerization of all-trans-retinal as previously described (14Qi Y. Zhao R. Cao H. Sui X. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Homemade lipid strips were prepared by spotting on nitrocellulose membranes 1 μl of individual lipid compounds dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) at a concentration of 0.01–1 mg/ml. The strips were air-dried and kept at 4 °C in the dark. Anti-PTP-MEG2 antibodies 144 and 159 were raised against peptides corresponding to amino acids 575–593 at the C terminus and to amino acids 297–314 in the middle of enzyme, respectively.Expression and Purification of Full-length and Truncated Forms of PTP-MEG2—Three recombinant PTP-MEG2 proteins were employed in this study (see Fig. 1). They are full-length form PTP-MEG2 (amino acid residues 1–593), N-terminal Sec14 domain-truncated form ΔNPTP-MEG2 (amino acid residues 283–593), and C-terminal catalytic domain-truncated form ΔCPTP-MEG2 (amino acid residues 1–329). PTP-MEG2 and ΔNPTP-MEG2 were purified by using adenovirus and Escherichia coli expression systems, respectively, as previously described (14Qi Y. Zhao R. Cao H. Sui X. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). ΔCPTP-MEG2 was also expressed in the adenovirus. It contains a His6 tag at the C terminus without addition of any other extra amino acid residues. To generate the recombinant adenovirus carrying ΔCPTP-MEG2, a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–329 of PTP-MEG2 plus a DNA sequence encoding 6 consecutive histidine residues was inserted into adenovirus transfer vector pACCMV.pLpA. Recombinant adenovirus was generated by co-transfection of 293 cells with the pACCMV.pLpA construct and pJM17 adenovirus genome DNA by using FuGENE 6 cell transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The resulting recombinant virus was purified by soft agar plaque assays and then amplified in 293 cells according to standard procedures (15Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected based on expression of ΔCPTP-MEG2 in infected 293 cells as determined by anti-PTP-MEG2 antibody 159. The purified recombinant adenovirus was used to infect 293 cells to express ΔCPTP-MEG2 following the protocol used for expression of the full-length PTP-MEG2 (14Qi Y. Zhao R. Cao H. Sui X. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged recombinant protein was purified from the cytosolic extracts of the infected cells by using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The purity of the enzyme was about 90% as judged by Coomassie Blue staining. Western blotting analyses with antibody 159 showed single band of expected size (∼45 kDa).Lipid-membrane Overlay Assays—Nitrocellulose membrane strips spotted with various lipid compounds were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml full-length or truncated forms of PTP-MEG2 in Buffer A containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA). After extensive washing with Buffer A, enzymes bound to the membrane strips were probed with appropriate anti-PTP-MEG2 antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Detection was made by enhanced chemiluminescence reactions followed by exposure to x-ray film. The control experiments were performed without addition of any enzymes under the same conditions.Liposome Binding and Phosphatase Activity Assays—For liposome preparation, lipid mixtures in chloroform containing 320 μg PC and 80 μg PE plus 100 μg of indicated lipids were dried by using a speed vacuum concentrator and then were sonicated with a water bath sonicator in 0.5 ml of Buffer B containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 m NaCl. The suspensions were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The pellets were resuspended by in 0.5 ml of Buffer B supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml BSA. For binding assays, 50 μl of the lipid vesicles were mixed with 2 μg of PTP-MEG2, ΔNPTP-MEG2, and ΔCPTP-MEG2 made in 20 μl of Buffer B plus 0.5 mg/ml BSA. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, and both pellets and supernatants were used to make SDS gel samples. Equal proportions of the supernatants and pellets were subjected to Western blotting analyses with appropriate anti-PTP-MEG2 antibodies. For phosphatase activity assays, 2 mm para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was added to the mixture of PTP-MEG2 and lipid vesicles before centrifugation. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 20 min and were stopped by addition of 800 μl 0.2 m NaOH. Absorbance at 410 nm was measured and contributions by the lipid vesicles (∼10–20%) were subtracted in calculating the phosphatase activity.Transient Expression of Full-length and Truncated Forms of PTP-MEG2 in HT-1080 Cells and Immunofluorescent Cell Staining—HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells seeded on glass cover slips were transfected with a pCDNA3 construct carrying N-terminal Sec14 domain-truncated ΔNPTP-MEG2 in the presence of the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent or infected with adenoviruses carrying full-length PTP-MEG2 or catalytic domain-truncated ΔCPTP-MEG2. After 48 h, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-PTP-MEG2 antibodies 144 or 159 and then with a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Cover slips were mounted onto glass slides and visualized by using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a 100× oil-immersion objective. Cell images were captured with a cooled CCD digital camera.Loading of PS into Cell Membranes—To verify the interaction of PS with PTP-MEG2 in intact cells, we followed a well established protocol to load excess amounts of PS into cell membranes (16Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, unilayer lipid vesicles in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mg/ml PC (for controls) or a mixture of 2.5 mg/ml PC and 2.5 mg/ml PS, were prepared by sonication with a water bath sonicator as described above. The lipid vesicles were then added to PTP-MEG2 adenovirus-infected HT-1080 cells deprived of culture medium. Following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, free lipid vesicles were removed by washing the cells with serum-containing medium. The cells then were incubated in normal tissue culture medium at 37 °C for 2 h to allow translocation of loaded PS from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet by the aminophospholipid translocase. To detect the localization of PTP-MEG2, cells were fixed directly onto the tissue culture plates with 4% formaldehyde and stained with anti-PTP-MEG2 antibody 144 followed by probing with a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies as described above. Fluorescent cell images were visualized by using an inverted microscope with a 40× objective (Nikon) and captured with a cooled CCD digital camera.RESULTSPTP-MEG2 Specifically Interacts with PS—To study the binding of PTP-MEG2 with known lipids, we employed a lipid-membrane overlay assay that has become a very popular method to analyze lipid-protein interactions in recent years (17Kanai F.

The strips were spotted with 100 pmol of 16 different phospholipids. Following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer, we probed the membrane with purified PTP-MEG2 at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, among the 16 phospholipids analyzed, PTP-MEG2 bound specifically to PS. In control experiments without PTP-MEG2, no signal was seen with PS despite a few weak and nonspecific signals seen with several other lipids. We further verified the results by using homemade phospholipid strips. In addition to some common phospolipids, we also included fatty acids, cholesterol, α-tocopherol, and retinal isomers. The data shown in Fig. 2C further confirmed the specific interaction of PTP-MEG2 with PS and ruled out binding with other lipid molecules tested. Further experiments as illustrated in Fig. 2D revealed that PTP-MEG2 could easily detect 25 ng of PS on the membrane.Fig. 2PTP-MEG2 specifically binds PS as revealed by lipid-membrane overlay assays. Phospholipid strips containing the indicated phospholipids were probed with 0.5 μg/ml PTP-MEG2 in a washing buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 3% fatty acid-free BSA. Bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-PTP-MEG2 antibody 144 and an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Control experiments were performed following the same procedure except that PTP-MEG2 was omitted.

To verify this, we analyzed the binding of catalytic domain-truncated and Sec14 domain-truncated enzymes. ΔNPTP-MEG2 was purified from E. coli cells as previously described (14Qi Y. Zhao R. Cao H. Sui X. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, ΔCPTP-MEG2 was largely insoluble when expressed in E. coli cells. We thus employed the adenovirus system for expression of the Sec14 domain as described for the full-length PTP-MEG2. The protein was expressed as a His6-tagged fusion protein. Over 70% of ΔCPTP-MEG2 was partitioned in the cytosolic extracts of recombinant adenovirus-infected 293 cells. By using a single nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column, we were able to enrich the recombinant protein from the cytosolic extracts to over 90% purity as revealed by Coomassie Blue staining, and Western blotting with anti-serum 159 showed a single protein band (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows the results of lipid membrane overlay assays obtained with the truncated enzymes. Although ΔCPTP-MEG2 displayed a specific binding to PS as observed with the full-length form of PTP-MEG2, ΔNPTP-MEG2 did not show any significant interaction with any of the lipids analyzed. These data indicate that the Sec14 domain mediates the interaction of PTP-MEG2 with PS.Fig. 3Purity of PTP-MEG2 and ΔCPTP-MEG2 revealed by SDS gels. Purified PTP-MEG2 and ΔCPTP-MEG2 as indicated were separated by 10% SDS gels and then stained with Coomassie Blue (left panels) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blot analyses with PTP-MEG2 antiserum 159 (right panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4The Sec14 lipid-binding domain but not the PTP domain of PTP-MEG2 is responsible for binding with PS. Phospholipid strips from Echelon Research Lab were probed with 0.5 μg/ml ΔNPTP-MEG2 or ΔCPTP-MEG2 as described in the legend to Fig. 2 for the full-length PTP-MEG2. See Fig. 2 for abbreviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PS-containing Liposomes Bind PTP-MEG2 but Do Not Affect its Enzymatic Activity toward pNPP—The interaction of PS with PTP-MEG2 was also confirmed by performing liposome-binding assays (22Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 23Patki V. Lawe D.C. Corvera S. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Nature. 1998; 394: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We used PC and PE as carriers for the lipids to be analyzed, and lipid vesicles were formed by sonication. For the recombinant PTP-MEG2 proteins, we employed BSA as a carrier, which is necessary to reduce the nonspecific binding of proteins to lipid vesicles. Upon incubation of the full-length and two truncated forms of PTP-MEG2 with the lipid vesicles followed by centrifugation, proteins bound to the lipid vesicles were recovered from the pellets. As shown in Fig. 5A, among the 8 phospholipids analyzed, only PS displayed a specific and strong binding to PTP-MEG2 as indicated by a near total recovery of the enzyme in the lipid vesicle pellet and a near depletion of the enzyme from the supernatant. All the other lipids showed marginal basal binding. As expected, a similar binding with PS was seen with ΔCPTP-MEG2 but not with ΔNPTP-MEG2. These data confirm not only the specific interaction of PTP-MEG2 with PS but also reveal the role of its Sec14 domain in the interaction. We further analyzed the effect of PS on the activity of PT-MEG2 with pNPP as a substrate (Fig. 5B), but we did not find any significant effect of the lipid on the catalytic activity of PTP-MEG2. If anything, it caused a slight inhibition, which was also seen with ΔNPTP-MEG2, which carries only the catalytic domain. Therefore, PS does not affect the activity of PTP-MEG2 at least toward pNPP. These results agree with our previous study in which the assays were performed with lipid micelle containing Triton X-100 (14Qi Y. Zhao R. Cao H. Sui X. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, these data do not rule out the possible effects on PTP-MEG2 activity toward physiological substrates. By using the same procedures, we have analyzed binding and regulatory ability of other lipid molecules as described in Fig. 2. None of them showed any significant binding or regulatory activity (data not shown).Fig. 5PTP-MEG2 specifically binds liposomes containing PS, but its catalytic activity toward pNPP was not significantly affected. A, liposomes containing PC, PE, and one of the indicated lipids were incubated with PTP-MEG2, ΔNPTP-MEG2, or ΔCPTP-MEG2. Liposome-bound and -free enzymes were separated by centrifugation. Equal proportions of samples were subjected to Western blotting analyses with anti-PTP-MEG2 antibody 144 (for PTP-MEG2 and ΔNPTP-MEG2) and 159 (for ΔCPTP-MEG2). See “Experimental Procedures” for detail. B, analysis of the catalytic activity of PTP-MEG2 and ΔNPTP-MEG2 in the presence of liposomes containing PS. Data represent relative activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Sec14 Domain Is Responsible for the Localization of PTP-MEG2 to the Perinuclear Region—We performed immunofluoresecent cell staining to determine the intracellular localization of PTP-MEG2 as shown in Fig. 6. Staining of wild type HT-1080 cells with antibody 144 revealed a moderate expression of endogenous PTP-MEG2 in the perinuclear region resembling the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This localization is further confirmed by a much more intensive staining of over-expressed PTP-MEG2 in the same region upon infection of the cells with recombinant adenovirus carrying the full-length form of PTP-MEG2. Furthermore, ΔCPTP-MEG2 that contains the Sec14 domain alone displayed exactly the same staining pattern as seen with full-length PTP-MEG2. In contrast, truncation of the Sce14 domain resulted in the distribution of ΔNPTP-MEG2 in the entire cytoplasma. Note that ΔNPTP-MEG2 corresponds to the catalytic domain of PTP-MEG2. These data indicate that the N-terminal Sec14 domain of PTP-MEG2 is necessary and sufficient for the perinuclear localization of the enzyme. We believe that PS present in the perinuclear region may be responsible for such localization.Fig. 6The Sec14 domain is responsible for localization of PTP-MEG2 to the perinuclear region. HT-1080 cells grown on glass cover slips were left untreated, infected with adenoviruses carrying full-length PTP-MEG2 and catalytic domain-truncated ΔCPTP-MEG2, or transfected with Sec14 domain-truncated ΔNPTP-MEG2 constructed into the pCDNA3 vector. After 24 h, cells were fixed for staining with antibodies 144 or 159 as indicated. Note that exposure time for the wild type cells was substantially longer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Loading of PS into the Cell Membrane Alters Localization of PTP-MEG2—Translocation is one of the major mechanisms by which an enzyme or protein is regulated. Although PS does not change the catalytic activity of PTP-MEG2 (toward pNPP at least), it may regulate the enzyme by controlling its intracellular localization. To study the effects of PS on the localization, cells were loaded with lipid vesicles containing 50% PS and 50% PC according to a published protocol (16Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid vesicles made of 100% PC were used as control. The data are shown in Fig. 7. In non-treated cells and cells treated with control PC lipid vesicles, PTP-MEG2 was localized exclusively in the perinuclear region. However, loading of cells with PS caused partial localization of PTP-MEG2 to the plasma membrane. This translocation of PTP-MEG2 to the plasma membrane depended on incubation time after treatment with PS. Plasma membrane localization was apparent 2 h after PS treatment but totally disappeared 8 h later. This presumably reflects the redistribution of PS in the cells. Together, the data demonstrate a binding of PTP-MEG2 with PS in intact cells and an important role for PS in controlling localization of PTP-MEG2. It should be pointed out that the intracellular balance of PS may be the determinant factor for the localization of PTP-MEG2. Under normal conditions, PTP-MEG2 may be retained in perinuclear region by PS there, and the amount of PS present in the inner layer of the plasma membrane is apparently not sufficient to cause a translocation of the enzyme. We believe that a perturbation of PS distribution associated with cellular processes should target PTP-MEG2 to specific membrane compartments.Fig. 7Loading of PS into cell membranes alters localization of PTP-MEG2. HT-1080 cells plated in cell culture plates were infected with recombinant PTP-MEG2 adenovirus and cultured overnight to give rise to 50–80% PTP-MEG2-expressing cells. Cells were then treated with PC or PC/PS for 1 h as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Following treatment, cells were further cultured in normal culture medium for 2 or 8 h as indicated before staining with anti-PTP-MEG2 antibody 144. Arrows indicate plasma membrane localization of PTP-MEG2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIt has been well accepted that phospholipids are not only components of cell membranes but also act as important second messengers (24Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). A major characteristic of lipid second messengers is that they cannot diffuse freely through the aqueous compartments of cells. Once produced in a particular cell membrane, they stay there and often serve as markers for the membrane compartment until they are enzymatically converted or translocated or the membrane buds off or fuses with another. This membrane confinement makes lipid messengers ideal regulators of subcellular localization. Many proteins are localized to specific cellular compartments through conserved domains that specifically recognize particular membrane-bound lipids. PH, FYVE, and PX domains are some examples that have attracted much attention in recent years (17Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W1996613664,"The Pulmonary adenoma resistance 2 (Par2) locus of the BALB/cByJ mouse, located within 0.5 cM of chromosome 18, is responsible for reducing the mean multiplicity of urethane-induced lung tumors relative to those in C57BL/6J, A/J and C3H/HeJ mice. Thus, BALB/B6-Par2 congenic strain genetically identical to BALB/cByJ except carrying C57BL/6J Par2 alleles develops seven times more tumors than BALB/cByJ. To gain clues for identification of Par2 candidate genes, we analysed lung tumorigenesis in BALB/cByJ↔BALB.B6-Par2 chimeric animals. Of 100 tumors induced by urethane in 16 chimeras, 82 originated from BALB.B6-Par2 cells, indicating the Par2 phenotype to be cell-autonomous. In addition, the BALB.B6-Par2- and BALB/cByJ-derived tumors were similar in mean size, implying that the phenotype is primarily expressed during initiation rather than in the promotion stage of carcinogenesis. Given these results, we surveyed a comprehensive mouse genome database and physically mapped Par2 within a 2.3 Mbp segment containing three known genes, Polı, Mbd2 and Dcc. Among those, the Polı seemed to be the most reasonable Par2 candidate, since it encodes an extremely error-prone DNA polymerase preferentially incorporating G or T opposite template T in vitro, reminiscent of the Kras2 activation because of an A to G or T point mutation within codon 61 with which most urethane-induced lung tumors are initiated. Indeed, our sequencing of Polı cDNAs from BALB/cByJ, C57BL/6J, A/J and C3H/HeJ lungs revealed 21 BALB/cByJ-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region accompanied by seven amino-acid substitutions and an elevated frequency of alternative splicing, while no polymorphisms associated with tumor susceptibility were found for either Mbd2 or Dcc. Notably, we obtained evidence that BALB/cByJ Par2 alleles may selectively decrease the frequency of Kras2-mutated tumors compared with C57BL/6J alleles. Consequently, the Polı is an intriguing Par2 candidate clearly deserving further evaluation."

Two-component systems, either orthodox or multistep phosphorelays, have been largely demonstrated to be the most widespread signal transduction mechanism in eubacteria, and a wealth of these systems have been examined by genomic homology analysis, genetic mutation screening, and partial biochemical characterization. Members of this family of proteins are also present in eukaryotes such as yeast, fungi, and plants (reviewed in Ref. 1Perraud A.-L. Weiss V. Gross R. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 115-120Google Scholar). These systems play a central role in bacterial adaptation to extracellular conditions, acting as communication channels between the environment and the inner cellular functions. Although there are a variety of modular arrays in the two-component system family of proteins, in essence, they consist of a sensor protein, typically a histidine kinase (HK) 1The abbreviations used are: HK, histidine kinase; RR, catalytic ATP-binding domain; DHp, H box-harboring region; CA, catalytic ATP-binding domain; L, linker; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. responsible for the detection of a specific environmental signal that, through a His-Asp phosphotransfer mechanism, defines the activity state of its associated response regulator (RR). This RR ultimately controls the generation of an adequate adaptive response, most frequently by modulating gene expression (2Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Google Scholar, 3Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar). The growing information that proceeds from the analysis of the entire genomic sequences of different bacteria clearly shows that a single cell can harbor 30–60 distinct His-Asp-related phosphotransfer signal transduction pairs (4Varughese K.I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 142-148Google Scholar, 5Fabret C. Feher V.A. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1975-1983Google Scholar, 6Oshima T. Aiba H. Masuda Y. Kanaya S. Sugiura M. Wanner B.L.

In light of the complex network of homologous systems that populate a single bacterial cell, one critical and yet not well understood aspect of the mechanism is the basis for the specificity of the recognition between the HK and its cognate RR. Therefore, the characterization of the interaction between the two components is basic to understand the phosphotransfer reactions and to determine the essence for the fidelity in the recognition throughout the signaling process. Two broad types of HK have been defined in terms of the relative location of their substrate His and surrounding residues (H box) and the ATP catalytic binding domain: class I and class II (8Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Google Scholar). In class I, the prevalent type among bacterial HK classically represented by the osmosensor EnvZ, the H box is immediately followed by the ATP-binding domain. In the vast majority of the orthodox systems in which the sensor protein belongs to class I, this protein is a transmembrane receptor (9Stock J.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R364-R367Google Scholar). In the type II enzymes (whose only known member is the chemotaxis HK CheA), the H box is located in the P1 domain at the N terminus (10Dutta R. Qin L. Inouye M. Mol.

Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Google Scholar, 18Tanaka T. Saha S.K. Tomomori C. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Park H. Dutta R. Qin L. Swindells M.B. Yamazaki T. Ono A.M.

However, in terms of partner interaction, detailed structural analysis has only been provided for the interaction between CheY and CheA from Escherichia coli (21Zhu X. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23758-23764Google Scholar, 22McEvoy M.M. Hausrath A.C. Randolph G.B. Remington S.J. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7333-7338Google Scholar, 23Schuster M. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6003-6008Google Scholar), and SpoOF and SpoOB from Bacillus subtilis (5Fabret C. Feher V.A. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1975-1983Google Scholar, 24Zapf J. Sen U. Madhusudan Hoch J.A. Varughese K.I. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 851-862Google Scholar, 25Hoch J.A. Varughese K.I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4941-4949Google Scholar), where amino acidic residues involved in the mating have been disclosed. It is worth pointing out that, as mentioned above, CheA is an atypical HK, whereas SpoOB, component of the Bacillus sporulation phosphorelay cascade, is not an HK and consists in an isolated phosphotransferase-module that lacks the catalytic ATP-binding domain, although exceptionally retaining the capacity to form a four-helix bundle superimposable onto the homologous EnvZ domain (4Varughese K.I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 142-148Google Scholar). Collectively, from these studies it becomes apparent that recognition determinants on both partners of a HK-RR pair are essential for the specific interaction. In the pathogenic bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella typhimurium), the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system governs the adaptation to Mg2+ limited-media (26Soncini F.C. García Véscovi E. Solomon F. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5092-5099Google Scholar, 27García Véscovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Google Scholar, 28García Véscovi E. Ayala Y. DiCera E. Grosiman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1440-1443Google Scholar). The detection of this parameter allows Salmonella to discern extracellular versus intracellular environments and to pleiotropically control the expression of factors that determine the successful invasion and spread in the host (reviewed in Refs. 29Groisman E.A. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 96-101Google Scholar and 30Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1835-1842Google Scholar). PhoQ is a class I HK anchored to the bacterial inner membrane by two hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains that delimit a periplasmic sensor region. High resolution structural information of PhoQ has only come out for E. coli PhoQ, where Marina et al. (19Marina A. Mott C. Auyzenberg A. Hendrickson W.A. Waldburger C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41182-41190Google Scholar) described the crystal structure of the C-terminal catalytic region of the sensor that binds ATP. Additionally, previous work provided evidence about the Mg2+ and Ca2+ binding capacity of the S. typhimurium (28García Véscovi E. Ayala Y. DiCera E. Grosiman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1440-1443Google Scholar), E. coli (31Waldburger C.D. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26630-26636Google Scholar), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32Lesley J.A. Waldburger C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30827-30833Google Scholar) PhoQ sensor domains. We recently showed that S. typhimurium PhoQ is a bifunctional sensor, demonstrating that the conformational change triggered by Mg2+ upon interaction promotes a switch in the activity of the sensor from a kinase-dominant to a phosphatase-dominant state (33Castelli M.E. GarcíaVéscovi E. Soncini F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22948-22954Google Scholar). This was later reinforced by results obtained by other groups (34Montagne M. Martel A. Le Moual H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1787-1791Google Scholar, 35Chamnongpol S. Cromie M. Groisman E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 795-807Google Scholar). However, no studies have yet examined the molecular basis for the PhoP-PhoQ specific recognition in the transduction process cascade. In this work we characterized the interaction between the cytoplasmic region of PhoQ and its partner PhoP using different in vivo (interference phenotypes expressing liberated sensor domains) and in vitro (affinity retention columns and resonant mirror biosensor technology) approaches. We demonstrate that the PhoQ His-phosphotransfer domain (also termed DHp, for dimerization histidine phosphotransfer, in other two-component systems (Ref. 10Dutta R. Qin L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 633-640Google Scholar)) is responsible for the specific recognition and interaction with PhoP. Additionally, we provide evidence that this region undergoes dimerization. Chemicals and Reagents—Nitrocellulose membranes were from Amersham Biosciences. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The oligonucleotides were purchased from Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX.). Cell culture media reagents were from Difco, and chemicals were from Sigma. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The PhoQ-derived truncated proteins were generated by the polymerase chain reaction using forward primers PhoQDHp-CTF (5′-CGGGATCCGATGAGGCCTATCGAG-3′), PhoQ-CTF(C) (5′-GAGGATCCCATATGCTGCTCAAAAGCGAG-3′), PhoQ-CTF(D) (5′-GAGGATCCCATATGCTGGAAGAGATC-3′), each paired to the reverse primer QREV (5′-TATAAAGCTTATTCCTCTTTCTGTGTGGG-3); PhoQDHp-CTF (5′-CGGGATCCGATGAGGCCTATCGAG-3′), paired to QA-Ino-R2 (5′-TCCAAGCTTAACTGGCGCGATGCAG-3′); and EnvZCyt-CTF (5′-CGGGATCCGATGCCGTTAGTGGATCTT-3′), paired to EnvZCyt-REV (5′-ACGACAAAAGAGGCATAAGCTTGGG-3′) and cloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites of plasmid pUHE21–2lacIq (36Soncini F.C. GarcíaVéscovi E. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4364-4371Google Scholar) to generate plasmids pUHE::phoQLCyt, pUHE::phoQCyt, pUHE::phoQCA, pUHE::phoQDHp, and pUHE::envZCyt, respectively. Construction of plasmids pUHE::phoQ and pUHE::phoQH277V has been described previously (33Castelli M.E. GarcíaVéscovi E. Soncini F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22948-22954Google Scholar). All pUHE21–2lacIqBamHI-HindIII inserts were excised, purified, and subcloned into cohesive sites of pT7-7 vector to generate plasmids pT7-7::phoQLCyt, pT7-7::phoQCyt, and pT7-7::phoQCA, or into cohesive sites of pQE-30 or pQE-31 vectors (Qiagen), depending on the appropriate reading frame, to generate plasmids pQE-30::phoQLCyt, pQE-30::phoQCyt, pQE-30::phoQCA, pQE-31::phoQDHp, pQE-31::envZCyt, harboring N-terminal His6 tag fusion constructs. The PCR fragment obtained using PhoQ-CTF(C) and QREV primers with pUHE::phoQH277V as template was cloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites of plasmid pQE-30 to generate pQE-30::phoQCytH277V. S. typhimurium strain 14028s pcgG9283::MudJ (27García Véscovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Google Scholar) was transformed with pUHE-derived constructs or the vector as control, and used for the interference assays. E. coli BL21[DE3] strain transformed with pT7-7-derived constructs or the vector as control was used for the expression of the PhoQ-derived proteins and subsequent cell fractionation (33Castelli M.E. GarcíaVéscovi E. Soncini F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22948-22954Google Scholar). The soluble cell fractions were used for the affinity retention assays described below. E. coli M15/pREP4 strain was transformed with pQE-30 or pQE-31-derived constructs to express and affinity-purify the N-terminal His-tagged PhoQ- or EnvZ-derived proteins for the biosensor experiments. To express and purify PhoP-H6 protein, E. coli BL21[DE3] carrying plasmid pPB1020 was used. pPB1020 harbors a phoP His tag fusion gene (full-length phoP fused to 6 His codons in its C terminus) under the control of the T7ϕ10 promoter of the pT7-7 plasmid as described (33Castelli M.E. GarcíaVéscovi E. Soncini F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22948-22954Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Activity Assays—For the β-galactosidase activity assays, bacteria were grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium with addition of different concentrations of IPTG as indicated. Ampicillin was used at 50 μg/ml final concentration in the bacterial growth media when appropriate. β-Galactosidase was determined in overnight cultures as described (37Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Soluble or membrane protein extracts from these cultures were obtained by cell fractionation as described below, analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16.5% polyacrylamide) (38Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar) transferred to nitrocellulose and developed by Western blot with rabbit anti-PhoQ (C-terminal cytoplasmic domain) polyclonal antibodies. Genetic and Molecular Biology Techniques—Plasmid DNA was introduced into bacterial strains by electroporation using a Bio-Rad apparatus as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant DNA techniques were performed according to standard protocols (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR-derived constructions were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis performed using the fmol DNA sequencing system as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega Corp.). Protein Purification and Cell Fractionation Protocols—E. coli BL21[DE3] strains transformed with pT7-7-derived plasmids were used to obtain soluble protein extracts containing overexpressed PhoQ-derived truncated proteins for the interaction assays in affinity retention columns. Briefly, overnight cultures were used to inoculate LB media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. They were then grown at 37 °C to logarithmic phase (optical density of 0.6), and induced by addition of 1.0 mm IPTG, for an additional 3 h with shaking. Cells were collected, washed once, and resuspended in a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl (TK buffer). Cells were subjected to sonication and centrifuged 30 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as standard. These supernatants were diluted to a final concentration of 2.0 mg/ml. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The protein profile was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis. All His6-tagged fusion proteins were purified as previously described (33Castelli M.E. GarcíaVéscovi E. Soncini F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22948-22954Google Scholar). Affinity Retention Columns—Soluble protein extracts obtained by cell fractionation of E. coli BL21[DE3] strains harboring the vector pT7-7 or overexpressing PhoQLCyt, PhoQCyt, or PhoQCA (400 μg of total protein) were pre-incubated with purified PhoP-H6 (100 μg of protein) in buffer TK, 30 min on ice. Each protein mixture was loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA resin column (0.3 ml), previously equilibrated with buffer TK and blocked with control soluble protein extract (600 μg of total protein) to avoid nonspecific binding. Columns were washed with 3.0 ml of buffer TK, followed by 3.0 ml of buffer TK with 0.1 m imidazole, and finally the bound proteins were eluted with 150 μl of buffer TK with 1.0 m imidazole. Control columns were performed with each individual protein fraction and treated following the same sequential steps described above. An aliquot of 20 μl of each final elution fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide), transferred to nitrocellulose, and developed by Western blot with rabbit anti-PhoQCyt or anti-PhoP-H6 polyclonal antibodies. All Western blots were probed with the first rabbit polyclonal antibody, as indicated, and developed by incubation with protein A conjugated with phosphatase, coupled to a chromogenic reaction using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. In Vitro Phosphorylation and Phosphotransfer Assays—For the autokinase assay, His-tagged affinity-purified proteins (2.0 μg of total protein) were incubated with 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (7500 cpm/pmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10 min in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing buffer TKM (25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2). The phosphotransfer assay was carried out by co-incubating 2.0 μg of PhoP and 2.0 μg of PhoQCyt with [γ-32P]ATP in a 30-μl volume for 10 min, using the same reaction media described for the autokinase activity. For the transphosphorylation reactions, 2.0 μg of each individual protein (PhoQCyt, PhoQCA, PhoQDHp, or PhoQCytH277V) or the indicated combination of two proteins, were incubated in a 30-μl reaction mixture for 20 min, using the same reaction media described for the autokinase activity. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 9% glycerol, 10% SDS, 600 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.006% bromphenol blue). All reactions were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16.5% polyacrylamide), transferred to nitrocellulose, and then subjected to autoradiography. Direct Photoaffinity Labeling—The His-tagged PhoQ-derivatives PhoQCyt and PhoQCA were photoaffinity-labeled with [α-32P]ATP using a method previously described (40Wang L. Fabret C. Kanamaru K. Stephenson K. Dartois V. Perego M. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2795-2802Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (40 μl) contained each purified protein in a concentration of 0.3 μg/μl in buffer TKM with 5% glycerol, and 20 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min on ice in the dark; after this period 20 μl were removed and exposed to UV light for 5 min, on ice. UV light was generated by an ultraviolet lamp (model UVGL-55, UVP Inc.) at a distance of 5 cm from the sample. Treated and control samples were then subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16.5% polyacrylamide) followed by autoradiography. Measurements of Equilibrium and Kinetic Constants—IAsys affinity sensor analysis experiments were conducted on the IAsys Plus apparatus (Affinity Sensors Ltd., Saxon Hill, Cambridge, UK). Purified proteins were covalently coupled to carboxymethyl dextran sensor chips (Affinity Sensors Ltd.) via free amino groups using N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carboxidiimide coupling chemistry at 22 °C, using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. His-tagged PhoP or His-tagged PhoQCyt were coupled to individual cuvettes giving a signal of 520 and 390 arc s, corresponding to 10.5 or 7.8 ng of protein, respectively. All binding reactions were carried out in buffer TKM plus 0.05% Tween 20, at 25 °C, with constant stirring set up at 95%, and the data were collected at interval of 0.3 s. Ligate binding to immobilized ligand was monitored at multiple ligate concentrations, ranging 10-fold below to at least 10-fold above preliminary estimates of equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for each reaction. Kinetic analysis was performed using the FASTfit software (Affinity Sensors Ltd.), which provided the values of kon and kd at each ligate concentration. Second-order association rate constants (ka) were then obtained from a linear regression plot of konversus ligate concentration. Dissociation equilibrium constants (KD) were then derived for each reaction from the equation: KD = kd/ka. For the PhoQCyt-chip interaction, constants were obtained from equilibrium data. Binding curves were performed at several concentrations of PhoQCyt or PhoQDHp (10-fold below to at least 100-fold above preliminary estimates of KD), and the ligate was allowed to bind for 30 min to obtain a saturating equilibrium response (Req). Bovine serum albumin (1.0 μm) interaction was tested as a non-related control protein when using either PhoQCyt- or PhoP-chip, rendering basal level sensorgrams. PhoQ-derived Proteins That Retain the DHp Domain Interfere with the PhoP/PhoQ Transduction Cascade—Domain liberation has proved to be a useful in vivo tool when analyzing the functional architecture of multidomain proteins such as the histidine kinases CheA and UhpB (41Morrison T.B. Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5485-5489Google Scholar, 42Wright J.S. Olekhnovich I.N. Touchie G. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6279-6286Google Scholar, 43Wright III, J. Kadner R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3149-3159Google Scholar). This approach is based on the inhibitory effect that a subcloned and overexpressed protein domain exerts when it interferes by competition with the interplay between the endogenously expressed partner proteins, provided an interaction takes place between them. Taking advantage of this approach, we used truncated proteins derived from the cytoplasmic domain of PhoQ to perform an in vivo screening for the protein subdomain that retained the capacity to interfere with the signaling cascade and thus to interact with its constituents. As is depicted in Fig. 1A, PhoQLCyt spans the whole cytoplasmic region encompassing the putative linker (L), the H box-harboring region (DHp), and the catalytic ATP-binding domain (CA), PhoQCyt lacks the putative L domain, PhoQDHp contains the H box-harboring domain but lacks CA, and PhoQCA harbors only the CA domain. All constructs were cloned into vector pUHE21–2lacIq and each resulting plasmid was introduced into the S. typhimurium 14028s pcgG9283::MudJ strain by electroporation. Protein expression was induced by addition of increasing concentrations of IPTG to the growth media as indicated in Fig. 1B. The expression levels of the reporter gene pcgG, a representative phoP-activated gene, was followed by measuring the β-galactosidase activity from the pcgG-lacZ transcriptional fusion. As shown in Fig. 1B, intact PhoQ, mutant PhoQH277V, PhoQLCyt, PhoQCyt, and PhoQDHp showed a 3.3-, 3.3-, 2.2-, 4.0-, and 2.6-fold inhibition of pcgG expression, respectively (calculated at 0.3 mm IPTG induction), although PhoQCA showed no effect on the reporter gene expression when compared with the strain that harbors the control vector. Cellular fractionation followed by immunodetection analysis showed that, with the exception of membrane-anchored PhoQ and PhoQH277V, all PhoQ-derived proteins expressed partitioned into the soluble cell fraction (Fig. 1C). In the immunodetection assay PhoQDHp appears as a faint band, although in Coomassie Blue-stained gels it showed the same intensity as the other truncated proteins, indicating that this protein did not react efficiently with the rabbit anti-PhoQCyt polyclonal serum used to develop the Western (this was also the case when we immunodetected a His-tagged Pho-QDHp purified protein with this antibodies; data not shown). These results suggested that all PhoQ-derived proteins that retain the DHp domain were able to interfere with the transduction cascade that leads to gene activation. This interference effect could conceivably be attributed to different mechanisms that can simultaneously take place: (a) the dimerization or oligomerization of the endogenous PhoQ with the overexpressed proteins rendering non-functional complexes, (b) the sequestration of the chromosomally expressed PhoP by the overexpressed full-length PhoQ or its truncated derivatives, and (c) a phosphatase activity acting on phospho-PhoP. Although we cannot completely rule out the third possibility, we favor the interaction/sequestration alternative as being the dominant cause for down-regulation because: (a) when full-length PhoQ is overexpressed pcgG inhibition is observed even when cells were grown in low Mg2+, a condition that turns down the phosphatase activity of PhoQ, and (b) when we expressed the mutant PhoQH277V protein, which lacks the phospho-PhoP phosphatase activity (33Castelli M.E. GarcíaVéscovi E. Soncini F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22948-22954Google Scholar), the inhibition of pcgG expression was almost identical to the one obtained for full-length PhoQ (Fig. 1B). PhoQ-derived Proteins Encompassing the DHp Domain Interact with PhoP in an Affinity Retention Assay—To concentrate in the analysis of the PhoP-PhoQ interaction, we examined the capacity of the soluble PhoQ-derived proteins to interact with PhoP. With this purpose we performed an in vitro binding assay using purified His-tagged-PhoP pre-incubated with soluble bacterial extracts containing truncated PhoQ-derived proteins (Fig. 2A). To improve protein yields, phoQ-derived constructs were transferred and expressed under the control of the T7 ϕ10 promoter to the pT7-7 vector in E. coli BL21[DE3] and cell fractionation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As is shown in Fig. 2B, the immunodetection analysis of the proteins that co-eluted with PhoP (detected also by Western blot; Fig. 3B) from Ni2+-NTA resin with imidazole showed that both PhoQLCyt and PhoQCyt, but not PhoQCA, were affinity-trapped with PhoP-H6. Controls were performed to exclude the possibility that the different truncated PhoQ-derived proteins interacted nonspecifically with the column matrix; although PhoQCyt and PhoQCA alone did not show nonspecific binding to the Ni2+-NTA resin, Pho-QLCyt showed a low nonspecific binding, which accounted for ∼5% of the eluted protein, being the remnant 95% co-eluted specifically with PhoP-H6. PhoQCytH277V was also tested and rendered an interaction behavior identical to the wild type PhoQCyt (data not shown). These results qualitatively indicated that the PhoQ derivatives that retain the H box-harboring domain exhibit the ability to interact with PhoP.Fig. 3In vitro activities of the purified PhoQ-derived truncated proteins.A, purified PhoQCyt or EnvZCyt (2.0 μg of each protein, in a 30-μl reaction mixture) were individually incubated to allow for the autophosphorylation reaction. Asterisk (*) shows the positions of homodimeric phosphorylated PhoQCyt and EnvZCyt proteins. B, purified PhoQCyt was incubated alone or together with PhoP (2.0 μg of each protein, in a 30-μl reaction mixture) to allow for the phosphotransfer reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2041307801,"MIP-2A was recently identified as a MBP-1 interacting cellular protein. We have shown previously that MBP-1 acts as a transcriptional repressor. Functional association between MIP-2A and MBP-1 suggests that MIP-2A can act as a cofactor and relieves MBP-1-mediated transcriptional repression. In this study, we report the tissue-specific expression of MIP-2A and its role in the regulation of gene transcription. RNA dot blot analysis of human multiple tissue expression array suggested that MIP-2A is highly abundant in right cerebellum, pituitary, adrenal, and testis but barely detectable in skeletal muscle. Predominant expression of MIP-2A in pituitary tissue led us to investigate whether MIP-2A can transcriptionally regulate luteinizing hormone β (LHβ), a pituitary-specific hormone synthesized and secreted from gonadotropic cells. The LHβ promoter is regulated by the orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 and homeodomain protein Ptx1. Although each factor enhances the LHβ promoter, coexpression of both results in a strong synergistic activation. Therefore, we examined whether MIP-2A can modulate SF-1- and Ptx1-mediated transcriptional activation. Our results suggested that MIP-2A expression inhibits SF-1- and Ptx1-mediated transactivation of LHβ promoter. Subsequent analysis demonstrated that MIP-2A physically interacts with both SF-1 and Ptx1, thereby inhibiting transactivation of the LHβ promoter. Taken together, our results indicate that MIP-2A preferentially expresses in certain tissues, including the pituitary gland, and negatively regulates the LHβ gene transcription.

Majumder M. Steele R. White R.A. Ray R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 655-662Google Scholar). MIP-2A localizes at human chromosome 19 and encodes an ∼16-kDa protein. A computer search using the BLAST program matched MIP-2A with the coding sequence of the SEDL gene (1Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. White R.A. Ray R.B. Mol. Cell.

Sedlin cDNA has recently been cloned, although the function of this gene product is yet to be known (3Mumm S. Zhang X. Vacca M. D'Esposito M. Whyte M.P. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 285-293Google Scholar). We have shown previously that MBP-1 acts as a transcriptional repressor, and MIP-2A associates with MBP-1 to relieve its repressor activity (1Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. White R.A. Ray R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 655-662Google Scholar). Additionally, MIP-2A antagonizes the cell growth regulatory role of MBP-1.Pituitary gland synthesizes two gonadotropic hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone. Both hormones are composed of a common α-subunit that is combined with unique β-subunits that dictate the biological specificity of each hormone. The human LHβ promoter contains an SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1) element and several consensus Ptx1-binding sites that are conserved across species (5Halvorson L.M. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6645-6650Google Scholar, 6Keri R.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10782-10785Google Scholar, 7Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Google Scholar). The orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 is an essential factor for mammalian sexual differentiation and endocrine organogenesis. Targeted disruption of the Ftz-F1 gene in mice, which encodes SF-1, precludes the development of endocrine organs, including the adrenals, gonads, and ventromedial hypothalamus, and leads to loss of pituitary cell types (8Ingraham H.A.

Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Google Scholar). SF-1–/– mice exhibit markedly reduced mRNA levels for several pituitary-specific genes including luteinizing hormone β (12Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Google Scholar, 13Shinoda K. Lei H. Yoshii H. Nomura M. Nagano M. Shiba H. Sasaki H. Osawa Y. Ninomiya Y. Niwa O. Morohashi K.-I. Li E. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 22-29Google Scholar).The Ptx family of transcription factors is a recently identified class of bicoid-related homeoproteins that are thought to be involved in the development of anterior structures and in mesoderm specification (14Tremblay J.J. Marcil A. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3431-3441Google Scholar). Ptx1 was cloned initially as a regulator of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression in pituitary corticotrope cells (15Lamonerie T. Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Therrien M. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1284-1295Google Scholar) but was later found to be a panpituitary regulator of transcription (7Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Google Scholar). The Ptx1 transcription factor is present in all adult pituitary cells and activates transcription of a large set of pituitary target genes (7Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Google Scholar, 15Lamonerie T. Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Therrien M. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1284-1295Google Scholar, 16Szeto D.P. Ryan A.K.

Ptx1 activates the LHβ promoter in synergy with SF-1 (7Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Google Scholar) and with the immediate early response gene product, Egr-1 (18Tremblay J.J. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2567-2576Google Scholar). Egr-1 interacts directly with Ptx1 and with SF-1, leading to an enhancement of LHβ transcription (18Tremblay J.J. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2567-2576Google Scholar). Thus, Ptx1 appears to work in a combinatorial code to confer lineage- and promoter-specific gene transcription in the pituitary gland (14Tremblay J.J. Marcil A. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3431-3441Google Scholar). In this study, we observed differential expression of MIP-2A in various human tissues including pituitary gland. We demonstrated that MIP-2A acts as a coregulator of SF-1- and Ptx1-mediated activation of LHβ gene transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA Dot Blot Analysis—Human multiple tissue expression array (Clontech) was performed by RNA blot analysis according to the manufacturer's protocol to examine the MIP-2A expression. The mRNA concentration of each tissue or cells in the array was normalized by the manufacturer to yield similar hybridization signals for various housekeeping genes allowing comparative analysis of gene expression. The array blot was hybridized using the entire cDNA of MIP-2A (including a 213-bp 5′-noncoding sequence) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) under high stringency. After hybridization and washing under high stringent conditions, the blot was exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography.Cell Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—Monkey kidney cell lines (CV1 and COS-7) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat pituitary gonadotrope cells (Lβ T2) and somatolactotropic cells (GH3) were kindly provided by Pamela Mellon (University of San Diego, San Diego, CA) and John Nilson (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) (19Turgeon J.L. Kimura Y. Waring D.W. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 439-450Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid LHβ-luc (human luteinizing hormone β promoter in the upstream of luciferase gene) and 0.5 μg of CMV-MIP-2A and CMV-SF-1 or CMV-Ptx1 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Empty vector was used as the control in the luciferase assay. In a different experiment, cells were transfected with 1 μg of 2xSF1-tk-luc (two consensus DNA-binding sequences for SF-1 upstream of the tk promoter in luciferase reporter construct) or G5E1b-luc, 0.2 μg of CMV-SF-1, and different doses of CMV-MIP-2A (0.2 –2 μg) using LipofectAMINE. Luciferase activity was determined after lysing the cells with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) using a luminometer (Optocomp II, MGM Instruments) as described previously (20Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. Yaciuk P. Chrivia J. Ray R. Ray R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7184-7188Google Scholar). The activities were normalized with respect to the protein concentration of the cell lysates.Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—COS-7 cells were cotransfected with CMV-FLAG-Ptx1 (21Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. Ray R. Ray R.B. Virology. 2003; 306: 51-59Google Scholar) and/or CMV-HASF-1 (22Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 521-526Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared after 48 h of transfection in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with His-MIP-2A beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-12% PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to FLAG for detection of Ptx1 or an antibody to HA for SF-1. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Study—GH3 cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with CMV-HASF-1 and/or CMV-FLAG-MIP-2A using LipofectAMINE. Cells were washed 48 h post-transfection and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and washed and incubated either with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to HA-epitope or anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed and incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies for1hat room temperature. Finally, cells were washed and mounted for confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad 1024). Fluorescent images were superimposed digitally to allow fine comparison. Colocalization of green (Alexa 488) and red (Alexa 568) signals in a single pixel produces yellow color, whereas separated signals remain green or red. Cells did not display a detectable staining when negative control sera were used.RESULTSExpression of MIP-2A in Human Tissues—We examined expression of MIP-2A using a multiple tissue expression array with mRNA from several human tissues and cell lines. MIP-2A cDNA probe containing the 5′-untranslated region upstream of the entire coding sequence was hybridized with a human multiple tissue array blot (Fig. 1). Predominant expression of MIP-2A was observed in the right cerebellum (2B), pituitary gland (3D), testis (8F), and adrenal gland (9C). Expression of MIP-2A was barely detected in the skeletal muscle (7B). Lower level expression of MIP-2A was also observed in bone marrow (7G), the bladder (8C), ovary (8G), HL-60 (10A), Burkitt's lymphoma-Raji (10E), and lung carcinoma-A549 (10H) cells. Moderate to low levels of MIP-2A expression were detected in all the other tissues. In the negative control Escherichia coli DNA (D12), a moderate hybridization signal was noted as reported earlier (23Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Google Scholar); however, no signal was detected from the other negative controls such as yeast total RNA (12A), yeast tRNA (12B), E. coli rRNA (12C), poly(rA) (12E), human Cot-1DNA (12F), human DNA (100 ng) (12G), and human DNA (500 ng) (12H). The coding sequence of MIP-2A displays identity with that of SEDL; however, the 5′-noncoding region differs significantly (1Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. White R.A. Ray R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 655-662Google Scholar). SEDL is expressed at a high level in several tissues including skeletal muscle (2Gedeon A.K. Colley A. Jamieson R. Thompson E.M. Rogers J. Sillence D. Tiller G.E. Mulley J.C. Gecz J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 400-404Google Scholar, 3Mumm S. Zhang X. Vacca M. D'Esposito M. Whyte M.P. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 285-293Google Scholar), whereas MIP-2A is barely detected in skeletal muscle. Therefore, this result suggested a substantial difference in expression pattern between MIP-2A and SEDL.MIP-2A Inhibits SF-1-mediated Activation of the Human LHβ Promoter—We have shown previously that association between MIP-2A and MBP-1 relieved MBP-1-mediated transcriptional repression (1Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. White R.A. Ray R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 655-662Google Scholar). Pituitary gonadotrope cells synthesize and secrete the luteinizing hormone in maintaining reproductive capacity in both males and females (24Keri R.A. Wolfe M.W. Saunders T.L. Anderson I. Kendall S.K. Wagner T. Yeung J. Gorski J. Nett T.M. Camper S.A. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1807-1816Google Scholar). Because MIP-2A predominantly expresses in the pituitary gland, we postulated that MIP-2A may modulate the pituitary-specific LHβ transcription. Therefore, we examined expression of MIP-2A in pituitary gonadotrope and non-gonadotrope cells. Total RNA was isolated from a rat pituitary gonadotrope cell line (LβT2) and a non-gonadotrope pituitary cell line (GH3). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using MIP-2A-specific primers (1Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. White R.A. Ray R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 655-662Google Scholar). Analysis of the reverse transcriptase-PCR products suggested a higher level expression of MIP-2A in the LβT2 cell line (Fig. 2). On the other hand, a lower level expression of MIP-2A in GH3 cells was observed under similar experimental conditions. Activation of the LHβ gene transcription is regulated by both SF-1 and Ptx1. SF-1 transactivates the LHβ promoter activity by binding to a specific sequence (5Halvorson L.M. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6645-6650Google Scholar, 6Keri R.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10782-10785Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the role of MIP-2A on SF-1-mediated transactivation of the LHβ gene, we performed an in vitro reporter gene assay using the LHβ promoter (the 5′-flanking region containing –668 to –8 bp relative to the translation start site) linked to a luciferase gene (LHβ-luc). CV1 cells were cotransfected with CMV-HASF-1 and CMV-MIP-2A along with the human LHβ-luc reporter construct. Empty vector was used as a negative control. Our results suggested that SF-1 expression increased transcriptional activity of the LHβ promoter to ∼4-fold, which was relieved to the basal level upon coexpression of MIP-2A (Fig. 3A). However, MIP-2A alone did not exhibit a detectable activity on the LHβ promoter suggesting that MIP-2A can exert its inhibitory effect on SF-1-mediated transactivation of the human LHβ promoter.Fig. 2Detection of MIP-2A expression in pituitary cell lineages. A semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was performed for detection of endogenous MIP-2A levels in pituitary gonadotrope (LβT2) and non-gonadotrope (GH3) cells using specific primers. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control to normalize RNA concentration (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Effect of MIP-2A on SF-1-mediated transcriptional activation.A, MIP-2A inhibits SF-1-mediated transactivation of the human LHβ promoter. A LHβ-luc reporter gene (human LHβ promoter linked to luciferase gene) was transfected into CV1 cells with SF-1 and MIP-2A expression plasmid DNAs. The amount of DNA was kept constant in each transfection by adding the empty vector DNA. Luciferase assay was performed at 48 h post-transfection. Triplicate transfections were performed in each set of experiments, and relative luciferase activity is presented. Small bars represent standard deviation from triplicate analysis. B, pituitary gonadotrope LβT2 cells were transfected with human LHβ-luc reporter construct (2 μg) and increasing doses (0.4, 0.8, and 2 μg) of CMV-MIP-2A. Luciferase activity was measured after 48 h of transfection, and relative luciferase activity is presented with standard deviation. C, MIP-2A modulates SF-1-dependent transcription. CV1 or GH3 cells were cotransfected with a SF-1-responsive reporter construct (2xSF1-tk-luc) containing two SF-1 binding sequences upstream of the tk promoter and a SF-1 expression vector along with the empty vector or MIP-2A expression plasmid DNA. The amount of DNA was kept constant in each transfection by adding the empty vector DNA. Luciferase assay was performed at 48 h post-transfection. Triplicate transfections were performed in each set of experiments, and relative luciferase activity is presented with standard deviation from triplicate analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further verify that MIP-2A indeed modulates the SF-1-mediated activation of the LHβ promoter, we performed an in vitro reporter assay in pituitary gonadotrope LβT2 cells. LHβ-luc was transfected with empty vector or different doses of CMV-MIP-2A into LβT2 cells. Luciferase activity was measured after 48 h of transfection. Our results demonstrated that MIP-2A represses LHβ promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B).SF-1 activates transcription by binding its specific DNA sequence on the target gene promoter (7Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Google Scholar). We observed that MIP-2A relieves SF-1-mediated transactivation. To determine whether the regulatory effect of MIP-2A is indeed dependent on the presence of the SF-1-responsive element, we have used a synthetic reporter plasmid with two SF-1-binding sites (2xSF1-tk-luc). CV1 or pituitary non-gonatrope cell line GH3 (lacking endogenous SF-1) was transfected with 2xSF1-tk-luc reporter plasmid, CMV-SF-1, and CMV-MIP-2A. Luciferase activity was measured after 48 h of transfection. SF-1 expression induced about 8 –20-fold activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, when MIP-2A was coexpressed with SF-1, luciferase activity was inhibited to the basal level. This result further suggests that MIP-2A interferes with SF-1-dependent transactivation.MIP-2A Interrupts Ptx1-mediated Transactivation of the Human LHβ Promoter—Ptx1 binds to the regulatory sequences and activates most pituitary-hormone coding gene promoters including LHβ (7Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Google Scholar, 17Lanctot C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1416-1422Google Scholar). Therefore, we further investigated whether MIP-2A can interrupt Ptx1-mediated regulation of the LHβ promoter activity in a similar in vitro reporter gene assay using LHβ-luc reporter construct. Empty vector was used as a negative control. We observed that exogenous expression of Ptx1 induces the LHβ promoter activity (∼6-fold), which was repressed by MIP-2A in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). However, expression of MIP-2A alone did not have a detectable activity on the LHβ promoter suggesting that MIP-2A also perturbs Ptx1-mediated activation of the LHβ promoter.Fig. 4MIP-2A relieves Ptx1-mediated transactivation of the LHβ promoter. CV1 cells were cotransfected with Ptx1 (0.5 μg) and MIP-2A (0.1 and 0.5 μg) expression plasmid DNAs along with 1.0 μg of the LHβ-luc reporter gene. The amount of DNA was kept constant in each transfection by adding the empty vector DNA. Luciferase assay was performed at 48 h post-transfection. At least three independent transfections were performed in each set of experiments, and relative luciferase activity is presented with standard deviation from triplicate analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)MIP-2A Perturbs the Synergistic Effect of SF-1 and Ptx1 on LHβ Promoter—We further examined whether MIP-2A relieves the synergistic effect of SF-1 and Ptx1 on LHβ promoter activation. CV1 cells were cotransfected with CMV-HASF-1, CMV-FLAGPtx1, or CMV-MIP-2A effector plasmid DNAs along with the reporter gene LHβ-luc, and luciferase assay was performed after 48 h of transfection. Empty vector was used as a negative control and to keep the amount of DNA constant in each transfection. Expression of SF-1 or Ptx1 activated the promoter by ∼2–3-fold in a suboptimal dose (Fig. 5). However, coexpression of SF-1 and Ptx1 further enhanced the promoter activity (∼8-fold) as compared with SF-1 or Ptx-1 alone. Introduction of MIP-2A relieved the synergistic activation of LHβ promoter mediated by SF-1 and Ptx1 in a dose-dependent manner. We have also examined the effect of MIP-2A on LHβ promoter in LβT2 cells where both SF-1 and Ptx1 are expressed. Exogenous expression of SF-1 or Ptx1 in LβT2 cells did not significantly activate LHβ promoter as observed earlier (25Jorgensen J.S. Nilson J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1505-1516Google Scholar). This is most likely to occur in the presence of high level endogenous SF-1 and/or Ptx1 in the gonadotrope cells. However, coexpression of SF-1 and Ptx1 enhanced the LHβ promoter activity ∼1.7-fold, which was repressed in the presence of MIP-2A (data not shown). These results suggested that ectopic expression of MIP-2A abrogates SF-1- and Ptx1-mediated transcriptional activation of the LHβ gene in pituitary gonadotrope LβT2 cells as well as in CV1 cells.Fig. 5MIP-2A interferes with the synergistic effect of SF-1 and Ptx1 on LHβ promoter. The LHβ-luc reporter gene was cotransfected into CV1 cells with an empty vector or CMV-SF-1 and CMV-Ptx1 and increasing amounts of MIP-2A plasmid DNA (0.2 and 2 μg). The amount of DNA was kept constant in each transfection by adding the empty vector DNA. Luciferase assay was performed at 48 h post-transfection. Results are expressed as the relative luciferase activity with standard deviation from at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)MIP-2A Interacts with SF-1 and Ptx1—Because MIP-2A does not bind to the DNA sequence, we examined whether MIP-2A physically associates with SF-1 and/or Ptx1. For this purpose, we performed a pull-out experiment by transfecting COS-7 cells with empty vector, CMV-FLAGPtx1, or CMV-HASF-1 construct and lysed the cells 48 h post-transfection as described previously (26Majumder M. Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Ray R. Ray R.B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1401-1407Google Scholar). Cell lysates were then incubated with His-tag MIP-2A immobilized onto nickel beads followed by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies to detect Ptx1 or SF-1 (Fig. 6). A specific association was detected between Ptx1 and MIP-2A (Fig. 6A, lane 2). Similarly, MIP-2A beads retained the SF-1 protein from the cell lysates transfected with the CMV-HASF-1 plasmid DNA (Fig. 6B, lane 2). These results suggested that MIP-2A physically interacts with both Ptx1 and SF-1. We further examined for association of MIP-2A with both Ptx1 and SF-1 in a similar pull-out experiment. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the Ptx1 and SF-1 expression plasmid DNAs, and the cell lysates were incubated with MIP-2A beads followed by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Our results demonstrated that MIP-2A pulled down both Ptx1 (Fig. 6A, lane 3) and SF-1 (Fig. 6B, lane 3) from the cell lysates. The blot was stained with Amido Black to visualize the similar amount of His-MIP-2A in each lane.Fig. 6MIP-2A physically associates with Ptx1 and SF-1.A, lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with empty vector (lane 1) or FLAG-tagged Ptx1 (CMV-FLAGPtx1) expression plasmid DNA alone (lane 2) or cotransfected with CMV-FLAGPtx1 and HA-tagged SF-1 (CMV-HASF-1) expression plasmid DNAs (lane 3) were incubated with His-tag MIP-2A immobilized onto nickel-agarose beads. Protein-bound beads were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using an antibody to FLAG-epitope for the detection of Ptx1. The blot was stained with Amido Black to visualize expression of His-MIP-2A. B, lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with empty vector (lane 1) or CMV-HASF-1 alone (lane 2) or cotransfected with CMV-HASF-1 and CMV-FLAGPtx1 (lane 3) expression plasmid DNAs were incubated with His-MIP-2A-agarose beads. The protein-bound MIP-2A beads were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using an antibody to HA epitope for the detection of SF-1. A faint band below the SF-1 observed in all the lanes appears as nonspecific. The blot was stained with Amido Black to visualize expression of His-MIP-2A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)MIP-2A Retains SF-1 in the Cytoplasm—Because SF-1 is a nuclear protein (27Hatano O. Takayama K. Imai T. Waterman M.R. Takakusu A. Omura T. Morohashi K. Development. 1994; 120: 2787-2797Google Scholar), and MIP-2A localizes in the cytoplasm (1Ghosh A.K. Majumder M. Steele R. White R.A. Ray R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 655-662Google Scholar), the physical association of these two proteins was somewhat surprising. To address this paradox, we investigated whether MIP-2A and SF-1 colocalize intracellularly. Initially, localization of SF-1 was examined by indirect immunofluorescence in GH3 cells (28Kaiser U.B. Halvorson L.M. Chen M.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1235-1245Google Scholar) transiently transfected with HA-tagged SF-1 plasmid DNA. Immunofluorescent staining using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to HA epitope exhibited a distinct nuclear localization of SF-1 (Fig. 7a). To compare the subcellular localization of SF-1 with that of MIP-2A, GH3 cells were cotransfected with CMV HA-tagged SF-1 and CMV-FLAG-MIP-2A. After 48 h of transfection, cells were stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to HA epitope for SF-1 expression (Fig. 7b) and a mouse monoclonal antibody to FLAG-epitope for expression of MIP-2A (Fig. 7c). Confocal microscopy displayed colocalization of SF-1 with MIP-2A in the cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 7d). These results suggested that MIP-2A sequesters SF-1 in the cytoplasm and modulates transcriptional activation of LHβ gene.Fig. 7Colocalization of MIP-2A and SF-1 in pituitary GH3 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2078092116,"The roles of six conserved active carboxylic acids in the catalytic mechanism of Aspergillus saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase were studied by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analyses. We estimate that Glu-124 is a catalytic residue based on the drastic decrease of k cat values of the E124Q and E124D mutant enzyme. Glu-124 may work as an acid catalyst, since the pH dependence of its mutants affected the basic limb. D269N and E411Q were catalytically inactive, while D269E and E411D showed considerable activity. This indicated that the negative charges at these points are essential for the enzymatic activity and that none of these residues can be a base catalyst in the normal sense. K m values of E273D, E414D, and E474D mutants were greatly increased to 17–31-fold wild type enzyme, and the k cat values were decreased, suggesting that each of them is a binding site of the substrate. Ca2+, essential for the mammalian and yeast enzymes, is not required for the enzymatic activity of A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase. EDTA inhibits the Ca2+-free 1,2-α-d-mannosidase as a competitive inhibitor, not as a chelator. We deduce that the Glu-124 residue of A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase is directly involved in the catalytic mechanism as an acid catalyst, whereas no usual catalytic base is directly involved. Ca2+ is not essential for the activity. The catalytic mechanism of 1,2-α-d-mannosidase may deviate from that typical glycosyl hydrolase. The roles of six conserved active carboxylic acids in the catalytic mechanism of Aspergillus saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase were studied by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analyses. We estimate that Glu-124 is a catalytic residue based on the drastic decrease of k cat values of the E124Q and E124D mutant enzyme. Glu-124 may work as an acid catalyst, since the pH dependence of its mutants affected the basic limb. D269N and E411Q were catalytically inactive, while D269E and E411D showed considerable activity. This indicated that the negative charges at these points are essential for the enzymatic activity and that none of these residues can be a base catalyst in the normal sense. K m values of E273D, E414D, and E474D mutants were greatly increased to 17–31-fold wild type enzyme, and the k cat values were decreased, suggesting that each of them is a binding site of the substrate. Ca2+, essential for the mammalian and yeast enzymes, is not required for the enzymatic activity of A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase. EDTA inhibits the Ca2+-free 1,2-α-d-mannosidase as a competitive inhibitor, not as a chelator. We deduce that the Glu-124 residue of A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase is directly involved in the catalytic mechanism as an acid catalyst, whereas no usual catalytic base is directly involved. Ca2+ is not essential for the activity. The catalytic mechanism of 1,2-α-d-mannosidase may deviate from that typical glycosyl hydrolase. In Enzyme Nomenclature Recommendations (1Webb E.C. Enzyme Nomenclature: Recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992: 349-362Google Scholar), three types of α-mannosidases, namely α-d-mannoside mannohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.24), 1,2-α-mannosyl-oligosaccharide α-d-mannohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.113), and 1,3-(1, 6)-mannosyl-oligosaccharide α-d-mannohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.114), are given as systematic names (2Ichishima E. Arai M. Shigematsu Y. Kumagai H. Sumida-Tanaka R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 658: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Yamashita K. Ichishima E. Arai M. Kobata A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Aspergillus saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase specifically cleaves the α-1,2-mannosidic linkage in the high mannose type oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. Glycosyl hydrolases are classified as retaining and inverting (4McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 5Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 6Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The inverting reaction occurs via a single displacement mechanism with inversion of anomeric configuration. The reaction usually involves two carboxylic acids. These residues are located ∼9 Å apart on average. One acts as a general acid catalyst, donating a proton to the glycosidic oxygen of the scissile bond. The other acts as a base catalyst, activating water for nucleophilic attack at the anomeric carbon. The retaining reaction proceeds via a double displacement mechanism with retention of anomeric configuration. The nucleophilic carboxylic acid residue attacks the glycosyl oxygen. A covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate is formed and hydrolyzed with general acid-base catalytic assistance. In the retaining enzymes, the two carboxylic acid residues are ∼5.5 Å apart. Recently the three-dimensional structures of 1,2-α-d-mannosidase from Penicillium citrinum were determined by Lobsanov et al. (7Lobsanov Y.D. Vallee F. Imberty A. Yoshida T. Yip P. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 5620-5630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures complexed with an inhibitor kifunensin and 1-deoxymannojirimycin demonstrated that both inhibitors bind to the protein at the bottom of the cavity in an unusual 1C4 conformation (4C1 is energetically more stable than 1C4). The inhibitor binding did not undergo major conformational changes. Three carboxylic acids (Glu-122, Asp-267, and Glu-409) were potentially involved in the catalytic mechanism. These correspond to Glu-124, Asp-269, and Glu-411 in the A. saitoi enzyme. The four other highly conserved carboxylic residues were also shown (the equivalent A. saitoi numbering is in parentheses): Glu-271 (Glu-273), Glu-412 (Glu-414), Glu-472 (Glu-474), and Glu-502 (Glu-504). These four residues seemed to be too distant from the substrate to be directly involved in catalytic action. They either are buried at the bottom of the active site or interact with atoms on the inhibitor far from the anomeric C-1. A molecule of Ca2+ is located at the bottom of the active site cavity. Glu-271 (Glu-273), Glu-409 (Glu-411), Glu-412 (Glu-414), and Glu-472 (Glu-474) are hydrogen-bonded to the water molecules that coordinate the Ca2+. The distance of the Ca2+ and an inhibitor/substrate suggests that they can directly interact with each other. Moreover, one of the candidates for catalytic residues, Glu-409 (Glu-411), coordinates the Ca2+ via a water molecule. The Ca2+ is essential for the enzyme activity of the mammalian and yeast 1,2-α-mannosidases (8Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10Vallee F. Lipari F.

The amino acid sequence of A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase (15Inoue T. Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) is 70% identical with that of P. citrinum enzyme (16Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and their substrate specificity to a high mannose type oligosaccharide is the same (2Ichishima E. Arai M. Shigematsu Y. Kumagai H. Sumida-Tanaka R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 658: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Yamashita K. Ichishima E. Arai M. Kobata A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Structures of the active center are believed to be conserved among A. saitoi and P. citrinum enzymes because of their high homology. Although we previously demonstrated the probable roles of these acidic residues (18Fujita A. Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), their catalytic residues have not yet been determined experimentally. In this study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to determine the functional role of catalytic residues in the 1,2-α-d-mannosidase from A. saitoi. Ca2+, potentially involved in the catalysis, was also analyzed with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. To probe the roles of the three active site carboxylic acids, Glu-124, Asp-269, and Glu-411, in greater detail, we generated the alanine mutants of these residues and assayed these enzymes. Rescue of activity by external anion was expected to provide valuable insight into the identity of the general base catalyst as well as confirmation of the identity of the general acid catalyst (19Miyake H.

Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Aspergillus oryzae niaD300 and a high level expression vector plasmid pNAN8142 were used for transformation experiments (25Ichishima E. Taya N. Ikeguchi M. Chiba Y. Nakamura M. Kawabata C. Inoue T. Takahashi K. Minetoki T. Ozeki K. Kumagai C. Gomi K. Yoshida T. Nakajima T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Man-α1,2-Man-OMe 1The abbreviations used are: Man, mannose; Man-α1,2-Man-OMe, methyl 2-O-α-d-mannopyranosyl α-d-mannopyranoside or α-d-Man-[1→ 2]-α-d-Man-1→ OMe; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; OMe, methyl ester; PA, pyridylaminated. was purchased from Sigma. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the 1,2-α-d-mannosidase gene (msdS) was performed by the method of Kunkel et al. (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used as mutagenic primers: E124A, 5′-AGCCTCTTCGcGACCACCATC-3′ (msdS position, 361–381); E411A, 5′-TGCGCCCGGcAGTGATTGAgAGCTTCTACT-3′ (1222–1252). The E124Q, E124D, D269N, D269E, E273Q, E273D, E411Q, E411D, E414Q, E414D, E474Q, E474D, and E504Q mutants were constructed by inserting the NotI fragment of the mutated genes in pGAM1 (18Fujita A. Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) into a NotI restriction site in pNAN8142. The plasmid pNAN-AM1 containing wild type or mutated msdS was transfected into the A. oryzae niaD300 strain. The transformation of A. oryzae and the expression of the mutated 1,2-α-d-mannosidase genes were carried out according to the procedure described previously (25Ichishima E. Taya N. Ikeguchi M. Chiba Y. Nakamura M. Kawabata C. Inoue T. Takahashi K. Minetoki T. Ozeki K. Kumagai C. Gomi K. Yoshida T. Nakajima T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant enzymes expressed in A. oryzae cells was also described earlier (25Ichishima E. Taya N. Ikeguchi M. Chiba Y. Nakamura M. Kawabata C. Inoue T. Takahashi K. Minetoki T. Ozeki K. Kumagai C. Gomi K. Yoshida T. Nakajima T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A pH gradient was substituted for the NaCl gradient in the cation-exchange chromatography. The recombinant enzymes were separated by SDS-PAGE gel as described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase antibody (raised in rabbit) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Enzyme Assay—The purified wild type and mutant enzymes were assayed for 1,2-α-d-mannosidase activity with Man-α1,2-Man-OMe as a substrate. Mannose from Man-α1,2-Man-OMe released by the enzymic reaction was stained by the Somogyi-Nelson (28Nelson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 153: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 29Somogyi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) method. One katal of 1,2-α-d-mannosidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to liberate 1 mol of mannose from Man-α1,2-Man-OMe per second at 30 °C and pH 5.0. The initial rates of 1,2-α-d-mannosidase activity were determined for a Man-α1,2-Man-OMe substrate at 30 °C and pH 5.0 in 50 mm acetate buffer using 8 substrate-concentrations ranging from 0.5× to 2× K m. Values of the catalytic coefficient (k cat) and Michaelis constant (K m) values were determined by fitting initial rates as a function of substrate concentration to the direct linear plot of Cornish-Bowden. Chemical Rescue Methodology—Activities of E124A, D269N, and E411A 1,2-α-d-mannosidase mutants catalyzing Man6GlcNAc2-PA to Man5GlcNAc2-PA in the presence of external nucleophilic anion at pH 5.0 were analyzed by HPLC analysis. Ten pmol of Man6GlcNAc2-PA (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto) with or without 3 m sodium azide was added to the enzyme solution. After 72 h at 30 °C, the reaction mixture was stopped by heating to 100 °C for 3 min and analyzed on HPLC using TSKgel Amide-80 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh Corp., Tokyo). The solvent and elution conditions were described by Kondo et al. (30Kondo A. Suzuki J. Kuraya N. Hase S. Kato I. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 2169-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Binding Treatment—The purified recombinant A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase was used as a Ca2+-free wild type enzyme. NaCl was added to the purified enzyme solution in the final concentration of 1 m. The solution was dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 50 μm CaCl2 for 16 h at 4 °C and then dialyzed against the same buffer without CaCl2. To analyze the content of Ca2+ binding to the enzyme, the solution was applied to atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Shimadzu model AA-660 (P/N206 –1000-02) apparatus). Thermal Stability Studies—The stability of the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound 1,2-α-d-mannosidase against thermal-induced unfolding was studied. The unfolding transition curves were obtained by a circular dichroism measurement done in a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. The protein solution was dialyzed against 50 mm formate-KOH buffer, pH 4.0, then diluted in the same buffer to adjust the A 280 to 0.2– 0.3. Path length of the optical cuvette was 2 and 10 mm for the measurement of the far and near UV regions, respectively. The fraction of protein in the unfolding state (f U) was determined using the equation f U = (θT – θN)/θD – θN), where θT is the ellipticity at temperature T, and θN and θD represent the ellipticity for the native and denatured protein, respectively. Specific Activities of Mutant and Wild Type Enzyme—Seven carboxylic acid residues to be studied were constructed in the cloned A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase gene (msdS) by site-directed mutagenesis. Recombinant enzymes were purified homogeneously on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1A) and identified as A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Purified forms of all recombinant enzymes were assayed by the Somogyi-Nelson method (28Nelson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 153: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 29Somogyi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No activity was detected under standard assay conditions for any of the mutant enzymes except E504Q mutant, and the specific activity could only be determined after extended incubation, typically at 60 –90 min (Table I). From Table I, it appears obvious that the mutations generated resulted in enzymes with significantly reduced ability to hydrolyze Man-α1,2-Man-OMe, as their specific activity is at least 103-fold less than that of the wild type enzyme. The specific activities of D269N and E411Q mutants in particular were not detected completely. The results of several experiments suggest that there is no significant contamination by wild type 1,2-α-d-mannosidase in the low activity of mutant enzymes (D269N and E411Q).Table ISpecific activities of purified wild type and mutant 1,2-α-d-mannosidasesMutantSpecific activitymkat/kg aUsing Man α1,2 Man-OMe as a substrate.

Results of these kinetic experiments are shown in Table II. Kinetic parameters for D269N and E411Q mutants could not be measured, since the reaction rates were below the detectable limit. The k cat value for E124Q mutant was 0.0078 s–1, almost 0.3% that of the wild type enzyme. E124D mutant enzyme also decreased the k cat value (0.9% of wild type enzyme). The K m values of E124Q and E124D mutant enzymes were essentially unchanged. Compared with wild type 1,2-α-d-mannosidase, the D269E and E411D mutant enzymes showed 17- and 28-fold increases in K m values, respectively, whereas the k cat values were slightly lower than that of wild type enzyme. The K m values of E273D, E414D, and E474D mutant enzymes were greatly increased to 23–31-fold that of wild type enzyme, and the k cat values were decreased (1–15% of wild type enzyme).Table IIKinetic parameters of wild type and mutant 1,2-α-d-mannosidases S.E in kinetic parameters: K m (±2.6-10.4 %) and k cat (±1.8-4.8 %).MutantKmkcatk cat/KmmMs-1s-1 ·mM-1%Wild type0.282.59.04100E124Q0.130.00780.0620.7E124D0.490.0220.0440.49D269NNDaND, not detected.NDaND, not detected.NDaND, not detected.D269E4.80.510.111.2E273D7.00.370.0540.6E411QNDaND, not detected.NDaND, not detected.NDaND, not detected.E411D8.01.40.182.0E414D8.60.0370.00430.05E474D6.40.0230.00360.04a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab pH-Activity Profiles of E124A and E124D Mutant 1,2-α-d-Mannosidase— Fig. 2 shows the pH dependence of the reaction rate for Man-α1,2-Man-OMe hydrolysis for wild type 1,2-α-d-mannosidase and E124A and E124D mutant enzymes. The optimum pH of E124D and E124A mutant enzymes shifted from 5.0 to 4.0 and 4.5, respectively. The activity of E124A mutant enzyme was found to be lower than that of wild type enzyme over the whole pH range studied, but the effect was more pronounced for the basic limb. Effects of an External Nucleophile on Alanine Mutant Enzymes—Mutation (Glu or Asp to Ala) at the general base catalyst creates a cavity in the active site that can accommodate a small external nucleophile. Sodium salts of azide at 3 m were used as external nucleophiles in the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of Man6GlcNAc2-PA sugar chain. The reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 3). The activity of wild type 1,2-α-d-mannosidase was inhibited by a high concentration of azide. The E124A, D269N, and E411A mutant enzymes were inactive in the absence of azide, as a peak corresponding to a Man5GlcNAc2-PA was not detected. In the presence of azide, these mutant enzymes could not be reactivated. Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometric Analysis and Kinetic Analysis of Wild Type 1,2-α-d-Mannosidase—Concentrations of Ca2+ were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometric analysis. The purified recombinant wild type 1,2-α-d-mannosidase almost completely did not contain Ca2+ (data not shown). Other divalent metal cations including Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ were also not detected. After Ca2+ treatment (see “Experimental Procedures”), Ca2+ content was determined as 0.9 mol/mol of wild type 1,2-α-mannosidase. Kinetic parameters of Ca2+-free and Ca2+ binding 1,2-α-d-mannosidase were determined (Table III); the k cat and K m values were little affected by the Ca2+ binding.Table IIIKinetic parameters of wild type and Ca2+ binding 1,2-α-d-mannosidaseEnzymeCa2+ bindingKmkcatk cat/Kmmol/molmMs-1s-1·mM-1Wild type00.282.539.04Ca2+-treatedaThe Ca2+-free wild type enzyme was treated with CaCl2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”0.90.291.956.84a The Ca2+-free wild type enzyme was treated with CaCl2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab EDTA Inhibition—EDTA inhibited the Ca2+-free wild type 1,2-α-d-mannosidase. The inhibition was investigated by fixed concentrations of EDTA in the assay buffer and by varying the concentrations of substrate. A Lineweaver-Burk plot showed a pattern consistent with competitive inhibition (Fig. 4) and gave a K i of 0.91 mm for EDTA. Ca2+ Binding Properties of Mutant 1,2-α-d-Mannosidases— Ca2+ concentration of the mutant 1,2-α-d-mannosidase was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry after Ca2+ binding treatment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Table IV, the Ca2+-free wild type enzyme bound 0.9 mol of calcium/mol of protein, ∼1 mol/mol. E124D, E411D, and E504Q mutants also contained 0.8, 1.1, and 0.9 mol of calcium/mol of protein, respectively. E124Q, D269E, D269N, E474Q, and E474D contained less calcium than 1 mol of calcium/mol of protein. E411Q, E273Q, E273D, E414Q, and E414D mutants demonstrated an almost complete loss of binding of Ca2+.Table IVCa2+ binding properties of wild type and mutant 1,2-α-d-mannosidases after Ca2+ -treatment determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometryMutantBound Ca2+mol/molWild type0.9E124Q0.44E124D0.8D269N0.12D269E0.2E273Q0E273D0E411Q0.06E411D1.1E414Q0E414D0E474Q0.45E474D0.5E504Q0.9 Open table in a new tab Effect of Ca2+ Binding on 1,2-α-d-Mannosidase Thermal Stability—The spectra of Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound 1,2-α-d-mannosidase at far and near UV region were consistent with each other (data not shown). The Ca2+ binding did not undergo a large conformational change. Thermally induced loss of secondary and tertiary structure was monitored at 222 and 291 nm, respectively (Fig. 5). T m, the temperature at which half of the molecules are unfolded, for Ca2+-free 1,2-α-d-mannosidase was 56 and 58 °C at 222 and 291 nm, respectively. The Ca2+ binding contributed to the thermal stability increasing T m to 58 and 62 °C at 222 and 291 nm, respectively. Identification of Catalytic Amino Acid Residues—Drastic reductions in the values of the catalytic coefficient (k cat) were observed in the E124Q and E124D mutant enzymes (Table II). This may result from significant impairment of the chemical steps in the catalytic reaction. The K m value was essentially unchanged from wild type enzyme. It is, thus, clear that Glu-124 participates in glucosidic bond hydrolysis. E124D shifted the optimum pH to be more acidic (Fig. 2). This result is shown by the lower pK a of Asp than that of Glu and supports the assumption that Glu-124 is directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. It could not be determined whether the Glu-124 residue is a carboxylate group (COO–) or carboxyl group (COOH). The pH dependence of E124A affected the basic limb, which was generally assumed to be due to the general acid catalyst. An external nucleophile sodium azide did not reactivate the E124A mutant enzyme (Fig. 3). Thus the Glu-124 may act as an acid catalyst. The mechanism of the all carbohydrate hydrolases usually involves a pair of carboxylic acid residues. In P. citrinum 1,2-α-d-mannosidase, two of the three residues (Glu-124, Asp-269, and Glu-411 in A. saitoi enzyme) are believed to be potentially catalytic residues (7Lobsanov Y.D. Vallee F. Imberty A. Yoshida T. Yip P. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 5620-5630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Glu-124 was suggested to act as an acid catalyst as discussed above. The most likely candidates for the other catalytic residues are Asp-269 and Glu-411. However, D269E and E411D did not show a considerable decrease in the k cat values (Table II). Recently, a base catalyst of an inverting β-amylase (EC 3.2.1.2) from Bacillus cereus var. mycoides was determined by the chemical rescue methodology for a catalytic site mutant (E367A) by azide (19Miyake H. Otsuka C. Nichimura S. Nitta Y. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the case of A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase an external nucleophile did not reactivate the D269N and E411A mutant enzymes (Fig. 3). Neither Asp-269 nor Glu-411 residues can be a base catalyst in the normal sense. Although the D269N and E411Q mutant enzymes were catalytically inactive, the D269E and E411D mutant enzymes showed considerable activity. The results indicate that the carboxyl groups at these positions may be required for the 1,2-α-d-mannosidase activity. Structural and modeling studies on cellobiohydrolase Cel6A (EC 3.2.1.91) from Trichoderma reesei suggest that the catalytic mechanism may not directly involve a catalytic base (31Koivula A. Ruohonen L. Wohlfahrt G. Reinikainen T. Teeri T.T. Piens K. Claeyssens M. Weber M. Vasella A. Becker D. Sinnott M.L. Zou J.Y. Kleywegt G.J. Szardenings M. Stahlberg J. Jones T.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 10015-10024Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of 1,2-α-d-mannosidase deviates from the typical glycosyl hydrolase. Role of Glu-273, Glu-414, and Glu-474 Residues—E273D, E414D, and E474D mutant enzymes decreased k cat values and increased K m values (Table II). The reduction of the k cat value is assumed to be due to the destabilization of the sugar ring. It has become increasingly clear that ring distortion at the –1 site is crucial in the catalytic mechanism of cellobiohydrolase (32Koivula A. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Valkeajarvi A. Claeyssens M.

The catalytic reaction of α-amylase from Pseudomonas stutzeri involves three acidic residues; two residues act as a proton donor and a proton acceptor. The other residue works to tightly bind the substrate, giving a twisted and deformed conformation of the glucose ring at position –1 (34Hasegawa K. Kubota M. Matsuura Y. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Glu-273, Glu-414, and Glu-474 may bind the substrate to change the conformation of the mannose ring into more reactive one. The three-dimensional structure of P. citrinum 1,2-α-d-mannosidase indicates that Glu-271, Glu-412, and Glu-472 residues (Glu-273, Glu-414, and Glu-474 in A. saitoi enzyme) in the active site are located at the bottom of the cavity and are not directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. It is demonstrated that these residues are hydrogen-bonded to the Ca2+ via water molecules, and the Ca2+ is involved in the stability of a substrate. But the recombinant wild type A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase contained no Ca2+ and other divalent metal cations. Despite the Ca2+ having no effect on the 1,2-α-mannosidase activity (Table III), its binding sites were conserved in A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase. This also indicates that the drastic decrease of the activities of E273D, E414D, and E474D mutants (Table IV) did not parallel the loss of the Ca2+ binding ability. These residues are involved in the substrate binding sites. Ca2+ Binding—It was reported earlier that the recombinant A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase has a molecule of Ca2+ (25Ichishima E. Taya N. Ikeguchi M. Chiba Y. Nakamura M. Kawabata C. Inoue T. Takahashi K. Minetoki T. Ozeki K. Kumagai C. Gomi K. Yoshida T. Nakajima T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the recombinant wild type A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase contained no Ca2+. The purified wild type enzyme did not bind Ca2+ with an addition of CaCl2 (data not shown). We found that the Ca2+-free enzyme bound 1 mol of Ca2+ per 1 mol of protein after the addition of a high concentration of NaCl. It was also demonstrated that the Ca2+ binding site is conserved (Table IV). 1,2-α-Mannosidase generally requires a divalent metal cation for the activity (13Gonzalez D.S. Karaveg K.

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the case of A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase, the Ca2+ had no effect on either the k cat or the K m value (Table III). Thus, it is clear that Ca2+ is not essential for the activity of A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase, although the Ca2+ binding site is conserved. EDTA was shown to behave as a competitive inhibitor of A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase (Fig. 4); this indicates that the enzyme contains no divalent metal cation. 1-Deoxymannojirimycin inhibits 1,2-α-mannosidase as a substrate analog. However, EDTA is not a substrate analog. Tris is a competitive inhibitor for 1,2-α-mannosidase from rabbit liver (14Schutzbach J.S. Forsee W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2546-2549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tris and other buffers containing primary hydroxyl groups substantially decreased its activity (38Jelinek-Kelly S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 3990-3998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxyl groups of EDTA may have an affinity for the active site of A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase. A molecule of Ca2+ contributed to thermal stability (Fig. 5). The role of Ca2+ for A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase is to protect the enzyme against thermal denaturation, and it was observed to have the same role in Saccharomyces cerevisiae-processing 1,2-α-mannosidase (12Lipari F. Herscovics A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ is essential for S. cerevisiae enzyme activity (12Lipari F. Herscovics A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), A. saitoi 1,2-α-d-mannosidase did not require Ca2+ for the activity (Table III). This is the first report demonstrating that 1,2-α-d-mannosidase requires no divalent metal cation for its activity."

In hepatocellular carcinomas, the potential role of TGF-β signaling as a tumor suppressor pathway can be illustrated by the presence of mutations in genes encoding TGF-β receptors or downstream components of this signaling such as Smad2. Although Smad2 is mutated in hepatocellular carcinomas, the alteration of TGF-β signaling with respect to tumor progression remains to be established. Using the HepG2 hepatoma cells, we showed here that expression of Smad2.Q407R, a missense mutation found in human hepatocellular carcinoma, was less effective than expression of wild-type Smad2 in enhancing the ability of TGF-β to induce transcription from the Mix.2 promoter. This effect was specifically associated with a decrease in the steady-state level of Smad2.Q407R, presumably because of an enhancement of its ubiquitination and degradation through the proteasome machinery. More importantly, we found that the unstability of Smad2.Q407R was reversed when this mutant undergoes homo-oligomerization with wild-type Smad2 or hetero-oligomerization with Smad3 within the cells. Therefore, our findings allowed us to propose a novel mechanism for suppression of the deleterious effect of a tumor-derived mutation of Smad2, which loss may lead to dysregulated cell proliferation during tumorigenesis.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; MEF, mouse embryonic cells; MH, Mad homology domain; ARE, activin response element. regulates a broad range of cellular functions (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar), including cell cycle arrest, regulation of extracellular matrix production, and induction of programmed cell death. TGF-β signals through a heteromeric complex of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, the type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) receptors. TGF-β binding to TβRII induces recruitment and phosphorylation of TβRI that transduces signals to downstream intracellular substrates, the Smad proteins (2Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Google Scholar, 3Zimmerman C.M. Padgett R.W. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 17-30Google Scholar). The interaction of receptor complex and receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smad), Smad2 and Smad3, is facilitated by SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) (4Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, Smad2 or Smad3 dissociate from SARA, a prerequisite for their hetero-dimerization with the common partner Smad (Smad4) (5Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Google Scholar). Then, the complexes move into the nucleus where they regulate the transcription of TGF-β-target genes, most of which remained to be identified (6Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Google Scholar, 7Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Google Scholar). In contrast to Smad2 and Smad3, the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, block signal transduction by preventing access and phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2 or Smad3 by the activated TβRI (8Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Google Scholar, 9Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that Smad7 can also function to target the ubiquitination and the proteasome-dependent degradation of the activated TβRI by recruiting the ubiquitin ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2 (10Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12780Google Scholar, 11Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Google Scholar). Smad proteins share two domains of highly conserved sequence in their amino and carboxyl termini, termed mad homology domain MH1 and MH2, respectively, linked by a proline-rich region of variable length. In the basal state, association of Smad proteins in homo-oligomer involves intramolecular interactions between MH1 and MH2 domains, and this interaction is believed to keep Smad protein in the inactive state (12Wu R.Y. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2521-2528Google Scholar, 13Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Google Scholar). However, once signaling has commenced, the MH1 domain dissociates from the MH2 domain, resulting in the hetero-oligomerization with Smad4. In the nucleus, the activated Smads can bind to TGF-β-responsive promoter DNA either directly through the MH1 domain or by associating through its MH2 domain with other sequence-specific DNA binding partners such as the Fast proteins (7Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Google Scholar, 14Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Google Scholar). Via the MH2 domain, Smads can also bind the coactivators p300/CBP, which have histone acetylase activity, or the corepressors TGIF, Ski, and SnoN, resulting in the recruitment of a histone deacetylase and the formation of transcriptional repressor complexes (15Liu X. Sun Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 1-8Google Scholar, 16Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Google Scholar). As potent inhibitor of cell growth (17Fausto N. Laird A.D. Webber E.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1527-1536Google Scholar) or inducer of apoptosis in hepatocyte (18Gressner A.M. Lahme B. Mannherz H.G. Polzar B. J. Hepatol. 1997; 26: 1079-1092Google Scholar), TGF-β controls liver growth. Loss of TGF-β responsiveness in hepatocarcinogenesis has been suggested to be associated with mutations that can occur in TGF-β cell surface receptors or downstream effector components of the TGF-β signaling. Thus, TGF-β type II receptor mutations were found with microsatellites instability (19Furuta K. Misao S. Takahashi K. Tagaya T. Fukuzawa Y. Ishikawa T. Yoshioka K. Kakumu S. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 851-853Google Scholar, 20Salvucci M. Lemoine A. Saffroy R. Azoulay D. Lepere B. Gaillard S. Bismuth H. Reynes M. Debuire B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 181-187Google Scholar). In addition defective receptor processing (21Bedossa P. Peltier E. Terris B. Franco D. Poynard T. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 760-766Google Scholar) and allelic loss (22Kawate S. Takenoshita S. Ohwada S. Mogi A. Fukusato T. Makita F. Kuwano H. Morishita Y. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 14: 127-131Google Scholar) have also been described, providing further evidence for a role of TGF-β in suppressing liver tumorigenicity. Important support for a more general role of TGF-β signaling in liver tumor development came with the finding that human Smad2 and Smad4 (also called DPC4, for “deleted in pancreatic cancer”) are mutated in human liver tumors (23Yakicier M.C. Irmak M.B. Romano A. Kew M. Ozturk M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4879-4883Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of alterations of Smad2 functions in promoting liver tumorigenesis is still unknown. In addition to hepatocellular carcinoma, several mutations in Smad2 and Smad4, either in MH1 or MH2 domains, were found in a variety of human tumors (24Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cell. 1996; 86: 543-552Google Scholar, 25Lei J. Zou T.T. Shi Y.Q. Zhou X. Smolinski K.N. Yin J.

Meltzer P.S. Hahn S.A. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2527-2530Google Scholar). Such mutations affect the phosphorylation of Smad2, the stability of Smad2 and Smad4, or their homo- and heterodimerization (28Hata A. Shi Y. Massague J. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 257-262Google Scholar), thereby leading to the loss of TGF-β responsiveness. In this study we have performed experiments to demonstrate that a mutation in the MH2 domain of Smad2 (Smad2.Q407R), previously described in hepatocellular carcinoma (23Yakicier M.C. Irmak M.B. Romano A. Kew M. Ozturk M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4879-4883Google Scholar), induced a dramatic decrease in the steady-state level of the protein. Unexpectedly, we observed that coexpression of wild-type Smad2 or wild-type Smad3 suppressed the degradation of the tumorderived mutation Smad2.Q407R. Plasmids—Expression vectors for HA-Smad4, FLAG-Smad2, and 6×Myc-Smad3 were described previously (29Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Google Scholar, 30Prunier C. Mazars A. Noe V. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Gespach C. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22919-22922Google Scholar). The activin response element (ARE)-Lux reporter construct was a gift from Dr. J. Wrana and expression vectors for myc-Fast1 was provided by Dr. M. Whitman. The TGF-β-responsive promoter, Gsc-lux, and expression vectors for the Smad2.R133C and the Smad2.L440R mutations of Smad2 were provided by Dr. L. Attisano. Myc-His-tagged ubiquitin and the dominant negative version of E2 ligases were generously provided by Dr. F. Soudou. Expression vectors for the MH1 and MH2 domains of Smad2 were obtained by PCR using the expression vector for Smad2 as a template. The Q407R mutation of Smad2 was obtained by mutagenesis using the “GeneEditor™ in vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis System” (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutated cDNAs were checked by sequencing (ABI310, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—The human embryonal kidney cell line (293T) and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. The human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) was maintained in Williams' E medium containing 0.1% albumin, 1 mm l-glutamine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, hydrocortisone, and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 293T cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) and HepG2 cells were transfected by electroporation with a 1-s pulse from a 1800 μF capacitor charged to 230 V. The immortalized mouse embryonic cells (MEF) from Smad2 wild-type or knock-out mice were a generous gift from Dr. E. Böttinger. MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transcriptional Response Assays—Expression plasmids for Smads were cotransfected with the ARE luciferase reporter and myc-Fast1 plasmid into HepG2 cells. At about 30 h post-transfection, cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and treated overnight with 2 ng/ml human TGF-β (Sigma). Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of Renilla luciferase expression from pRL-TK control vector. Experimental points were realized in triplicates in at least two independent transfections. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—293T cells were plated to semi-confluence and 24 h later were transfected with expression vectors by the LipofectAMINE method. The total DNA amount in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of pCMV5 empty vector. A pCMV5 LacZ that expresses β-galactosidase under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was included in all transfections to allow normalization of transfected proteins. After one night in serum-starved medium, 293T cells were treated for 1 h with 5 ng/ml TGF-β and then lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Aliquots of cell lysates were either analyzed by direct immunoblotting or subjected to immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) for 2 h, followed by adsorption to Sepharose-protein G for 1 h. The beads were washed five times in lysis buffer and samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with the appropriate antibodies: anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (Roche Diagnostics), or anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), as indicated. To control the amount of proteins loaded in the gel, all blots were probed with anti-actin antibody. The bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to rabbit or mouse IgG (Sigma) using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. Steady-state Protein Level Assays and Smad Ubiquitination—For Smad stability, transiently transfected COS7 cells were metabolically labeled for 30 min with 100 μCi/ml Redivue Pro-mix l-35S (Amersham Biosciences) in methionine and cysteine-free medium, and then chased in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml actinomycin D. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The involvement of the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway was realized by transfecting 293T cells with combinations of FLAG-tagged Smads and the dominant negative of E2 ligases UbcH5a, UbcH5b, UbcH5c, or 20K. In some experiments, cells transfected with wild-type FLAG-Smad2 or FLAG-Smad2.Q407R were treated for 6 h with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Lysates from those cells were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. For direct ubiquitination assay, 293T cells were transfected with wild-type FLAG-Smad2 or FLAG-Smad2.Q407R and Myc-His-ubiquitin. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 before being immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody. Transcriptional Activation of a TGF-β Responsive Element Is Decreased in Smad2.Q407R Mutant—Mutation of glutamine to arginine at codon 407 in MH2 domain of Smad2 (Smad2.Q407R) has been described in hepatocellular carcinoma (23Yakicier M.C. Irmak M.B. Romano A. Kew M. Ozturk M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4879-4883Google Scholar) and was suggested to be deleterious for the TGF-β signaling pathway. Indeed, the tumor-derived mutation Q407R maps to the MH2 domain in the three-helix bundle at helix H4 that is involved in the homotrimer formation (31Wu J.W. Hu M. Chai J. Seoane J. Huse M. Li C. Rigotti D.J. Kyin S. Muir T.W. Fairman R. Massague J. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1277-1289Google Scholar). To investigate whether the mutation Q407R interferes with the ability of Smad2 to mediate TGF-β transcriptional responses, we focused our analysis on Xenopus mix.2 promoter as a target of Smad2 because activation of mix.2 by TGF-β requires the formation of a Smad2-Smad4-Fast complex that binds to a sequence promoter known as the TGF-β/ARE. To evaluate the consequence of the missense mutation Q407R on Smad2 transcriptional activity, the TGF-β responsive HepG2 cell line was cotransfected with the wild-type Smad2 or Smad2.Q407R and the forkhead-containing DNA binding protein Fast-1 and the pARE-Lux reporter, which contains a luciferase reporter gene under the control of three copies of ARE from the Mix.2 Xenopus promoter (6Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Google Scholar, 7Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Google Scholar). As expected, expression of the pARE-Lux construct alone had minimal basal activity in HepG2 cells, but co-transfection with Fast-1 yielded a TGF-β-dependent induction of luciferase activity that was further enhanced by coexpression of cells with wild-type Smad2. Under these experimental conditions, we found that transfection of equivalent amounts of transfected Smad2.Q407R mutant could not disrupt the TGF-β-dependent transcriptional activation, but the mutant Smad2.Q407R was less effective than wild-type Smad2 in enhancing the ability of TGF-β to induce transcription from the Mix.2 promoter (Fig. 1A, left panel). Similar results were obtained either by transfecting HepG2 cells by the TGF-β-responsive promoter Gsc-lux, which, like ARE-lux, contains activin responsive elements known to bind the complex Smad2-Smad4-Fast (Fig. 1A, left panel, inset) or by transfecting the 293T cell line with the pARE-Lux reporter (Fig. 1A, right panel). A growing body of evidence indicates that the alteration of the Smad steady-state levels is one of the mechanisms by which tumor cells may escape to the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β (32Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Google Scholar, 33Maurice D. Pierreux C.E. Howell M. Wilentz R.E. Owen M.J. Hill C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43175-43181Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that the decrease of Smad2 transcriptional activity upon introduction of Q407R may be due, at least in part, to a reduction in the stability of Smad2 protein. To address this issue, we first investigated the level of Smad2.Q407R or wild-type Smad2 proteins in transiently transfected HepG2 (Fig. 1B, left panel) and 293T cells, (Fig. 1B, right panel) by direct Western immunoblotting. A dramatic decrease in the amount of Smad2.Q407R compared with wild-type Smad2 was detected irrespective of whether cells were treated or not with TGF-β. This decrease in the steady-state level of Smad2.Q407R seems unlikely to be attributable to a diminution of mRNA translation, because labeling of 293T-transfected cells with [35S]methionine showed that Smad2.Q407R and wild-type Smad2 were neo-synthesized at approximately similar levels (see Fig. 2A, chase 0 h). Together, the above observations strongly suggested that Smad2.Q407R might induce transcriptional activation less efficiently than its wild-type counterpart because of the reduced level of the mutated protein. If this prediction was true, then transfecting increasing amounts of Smad2.Q407R should produce a corresponding increase in transcriptional activation of the pARE-Lux promoter. Indeed, transfection of 20 μg of Smad2.Q407R was able to activate transcription with an efficiency approaching that elicited by cotransfection of 5 μg of wild-type Smad2, which is consistent with the hypothesis that introduction of the missense mutation Q407R in the background of wild-type Smad2 did not disrupt the function of the Smad2 protein as a transcriptional factor (Fig. 1C). Further evidence for the functionality of Smad2.Q407R was provided by our finding that this tumor-derived mutation retains its ability to be phosphorylated by the activated type I receptor (Fig. 1D) and to form hetero-oligomers with Smad4 upon TGF-β stimulation (see Fig. 5B). The Mutation Q407R Increased Degradation of Smad2 through the Ubiquitin/Proteasome Pathway—Having shown a decrease in the steady-state level of Smad2.Q407R, we next sought to determine whether this mutation leads to an altered turnover of the protein. To test this possibility, we performed a pulse-chase experiment with a [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture using transfected 293T cells (Fig. 2A). As indicated above, the amounts of neo-synthesized Smad2.Q407R proteins were similar to that of wild-type Smad2, which is consistent with the hypothesis that mutation Q407R may accelerate the turnover of the protein. Further evidence was provided by our observation that newly synthesized Smad2.Q407R disappeared more rapidly compared with wild-type Smad2. Taken together with the Western blot analysis, the data suggested that the mutation Q407R did not appreciably affect Smad2 synthesis but rather enhanced its degradative process. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a common pathway for the degradation of a wide range of cellular proteins, including Smad2. To approach the question of how Smad2.Q407R under-goes rapid turnover, we evaluated the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway in this process by investigating the effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 on the Smad2.Q407R stability or by cotransfecting 293T cells with dominant-negative forms of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubcs also named E2 enzymes). As shown in Fig. 2B, the steady-state level of Smad2.Q407R was dramatically increased in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. A similar increase was observed with transfection of the dominant-negative forms of UbcH5a, UbcH5b, and UbcH5c (Fig. 2C, middle panel). These mutant enzymes contain catalytic site mutations and have been shown to behave in a dominant-negative manner (34Gonen H. Bercovich B. Orian A. Carrano A. Takizawa C. Yamanaka K. Pagano M. Iwai K. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14823-14830Google Scholar) to inhibit the degradation of Smad2 mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome dependent pathway (Ref. 32Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Google Scholar and Fig. 2C, left panel). This effect was specific to the UbcH5 family because cotransfection of the inactive mutant 20K did not appreciably affect the overall pattern of Smad2.Q407R expression. In addition the data confirmed that the dominant-negative forms of UbcH5a, UbcH5b, UbcH5c, but not 20K can block the degradation of Smad2.R133C, a tumorderived mutant with an accelerated level of protein degradation (Ref. 32Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Google Scholar and Fig. 2C, right panel). Next, we sought to directly demonstrate that the mutation Q407R induced a constitutive degradation of Smad2 through the ubiquitin/proteasome system. For this, 293T cells were transfected with either FLAG-Smad2.Q407R or FLAG-wild-type Smad2 and Myc-His ubiquitin in the absence or presence of MG-132 (Fig. 2D). Consistent with published results (2Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Google Scholar, 35Lo R.S. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Google Scholar), little or no ubiquitinated forms of wild-type Smad2 were detected (lane 1). However, exposure of cells to MG-132 led to a marked accumulation of high molecular mass Smad2 forms corresponding to ubiquitin-conjugated protein (lane 2). More importantly, introducing Q407R into Smad2 leads to a 3-fold increase in the ubiquitination of Smad2 protein (lane 4). Taken together with the dominant-negative mutants of UbcH5a, UbcH5b, and UbcH5c ligases data, these finding strongly suggest that Smad2.Q407R is degraded through the proteasome pathway more rapidly than wild-type Smad2. Increased Expression of the Wild-type Smad2 Overcomes the Degradation of the Mutant Smad2.Q407R—Because Smad2 can form homo-oligomers, we next investigated whether the stability of the wild-type Smad2 may be affected by its association with the mutant Smad2.Q407R. To explore this hypothesis, 293T cells were co-transfected with wild-type 6×Myc Smad2 and either FLAG-Smad2.Q407R or FLAG-wild-type Smad2, and the steady-state levels of transfected proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, the level of 6×Myc wild-type Smad2 was not affected by coexpressing FLAG-Smad2.Q407R, demonstrating an inability of Smad2.Q407R to enhance the degradation of its wild-type counterpart. In contrast we found that Smad2.Q407R was stabilized when wild-type Smad2 was cotransfected. This effect occurs independently of TGF-β signaling because exposure of cells to TGF-β did not synergize with wild-type Smad2 to increase the steady-state level of Smad2.Q407R. During the course of the analysis we also examined the effects of wild-type Smad2 on the level of two other tumor-derived mutations localized either in the MH2 domain (Smad2.L440R) or MH1 domain (Smad2.R133C). As shown in Fig. 3A, an overexpression of wild-type Smad2 failed to overcome the degradation of Smad2.R133C but it was effective in stabilizing the tumorderived mutation Smad2.L440R. From these data, it can be suggested that the role of wild-type Smad2 in suppressing the constitutive degradation of tumor-derived mutations may be specific to mutations located in the MH2 domain. To investigate the stabilization of Smad2.Q407R by wild-type Smad2, we first examined whether the stabilization of Smad2.Q407R occurred through the formation of wild-type Smad2·Smad2.Q407R complex. To address this issue, cell lysates from transiently transfected 293T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody directed toward tagged Smad2 mutant, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody for the presence of wild-type Smad2 (Fig. 3B). Analysis of wild-type FLAG-Smad2 coprecipitating with wild-type 6×Myc-Smad2, showed that overexpression of Smad2 lead to a ligand-independent homo-oligomerization of Smad2, confirming published results (13Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Google Scholar). A similar result was obtained with FLAG-Smad2.Q407R and wild-type 6×Myc-Smad2 supporting the hypothesis that the formation of complexes between Smad2.Q407R and wild-type Smad2 may protect the mutant from the ubiquitin-dependent degradation. To demonstrate this directly, we used the tumor missense mutation Smad2.D450E (24Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cell. 1996; 86: 543-552Google Scholar, 36Uchida K. Nagatake M. Osada H. Yatabe Y. Kondo M. Mitsudomi T. Masuda A. Takahashi T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5583-5585Google Scholar) that completely disrupts the homo-oligomerization of the Smad2 protein (37Prunier C. Ferrand N. Frottier B. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3302-3313Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). In contrast to wild-type Smad2, coexpression of Smad2.D450E failed to stabilize Smad2.Q407R, providing direct evidence that the homo-oligomerization process plays an important role in stabilization of Smad2 mutant protein. To investigate the role of endogenous wild-type Smad2 in stabilizing the tumor-derived mutant Smad2.Q407R, MEFs from Smad2 wild-type or knock-out mice were transfected with the expression vectors for FLAG-Smad2.Q407R. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, little or no Smad2.Q407R protein in MEF Smad2–/– (lanes 3 and 4) was detected, whereas in MEF Smad2+/+, a large amount of the tumor-derived mutant Smad2.Q407R was observed (lanes 1 and 2), consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous wild-type Smad2 might prevent the degradation of Smad2.Q407R. Consistent with this, we showed that coexpression of wild-type Smad2 in MEF Smad2–/– prevented the degradation of Smad2.Q407R (lanes 5 and 6). As with 293T cells, these stabilization processes were totally independent of TGF-β cell stimulation. Accordingly with our biochemical analyses, these data indicated that wild-type Smad2 can restore the transcriptional function of the tumorderived mutant Smad2.Q407R by preventing its ubiquitin-dependent degradation potential. Smad3 but Not Smad4 Stabilizes the Tumor-derived Mutant Smad2.Q407R—The phosphorylation of Smad2 by the activated type I TGF-β receptor and its subsequent heterodimerization with Smad4 and translocation to the nucleus form the basis for a model of how Smad proteins work to transmit TGF-β signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. Therefore, we investigated whether the TGF-β-dependent association of Smad2.Q407R and wild-type Smad4 may result in an increase in the steady-state levels of Smad2.Q407R (Fig. 5A). In contrast to wild-type Smad2, we were unable to see any stabilization of Smad2.Q407R by wild-type Smad4 even in the presence of TGF-β. A similar conclusion could be drawn when the mutant Smad2.R133C was used instead of Smad2.Q407R. The absence of stabilization of Smad2.Q407R by wild-type Smad4 was not because of a lack of hetero-oligomerization because hetero-oligomers of FLAG-Smad2.Q407R/HA-Smad4 were detectable in 293T cells transfected with FLAG-Smad2.Q407R and HA-Smad4 in the presence of a constitutively active TβRI mutant, which is able to signal in the absence of TβRII and ligand (Fig. 5B). Because Smad2 and Smad3 are structurally highly similar and can form heteromers, the effect of overexpression of Smad3 in the transfected 293T cells was investigated. Similar to wild-type Smad2, we found that the steady-state level of Smad2.Q407R was increased (Fig. 5C) in cells cotransfected with wild-type Smad3 and this stabilization effect was associated with the formation of hetero-oligomer complexes (Fig. 5D). This effect was specific to the Smad2.Q407R mutant because increased expression of wild-type Smad3 did not protect Smad2.R133C from undergoing extensive degradation, as it has been shown for wild-type Smad2 (Fig. 3A). Thus, it is likely that Smad3 is involved in maintaining the integrity of Smad2 signaling by preventing the degradation of the tumor-derived mutation of Smad2, i.e. Smad2.Q407R, found in human liver cancer. The Smad2 protein plays an essential role in the TGF-β signaling pathway, which mediates growth inhibitory signals from the cell surface to the nucleus in a variety of cells, including hepatocytes. Because hepatoma cells were found to develop resistance to the negative growth-regulatory effects of TGF-β, it is tempting to speculate that one of the mechanisms whereby cells undergo neoplasic transformation and escape from normal growth control involves an altered response to TGF-β. A missense mutation (Q407R) in the MH2 domain of Smad2 has been identified in human hepatocellular carcinoma (23Yakicier M.C. Irmak M.B. Romano A. Kew M. Ozturk M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4879-4883Google Scholar), raising the interesting possibility that Smad2 might play a critical role in tumor progression of the liver. In the present study we show that the tumor-derived mutation Q407R can confer a decreased stability of Smad2 through increased ubiquitination-dependent degradation, resulting ultimately in a corresponding decrease in the ability of Smad2 to activate gene expression in response to TGF-β signaling. Our analysis of the steady-state levels of Smad2.Q407R strongly suggests that the primary defect caused by the Q407R mutant is to induce targeting of Smad2 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Consistent with this, transfection of higher amounts of Smad2.Q407R enhanced activation of the ARE-lux close to levels obtained with wild-type Smad2. Further evidence for the functionality of Smad2.Q407R is provided by our finding that Smad2.Q407R is phosphorylated by the activated type I receptor at the carboxyl-terminal serines that serves as TGF-β receptor phosphorylation sites. This phosphorylation event is important to Smad2 function because the nonfunctional form of Smad2 (Smad2.D450E) found in human colorectal and lung cancers is not phosphorylated (24Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cell. 1996; 86: 543-552Google Scholar). Extensive analysis of the TGF-β signaling pathway has clearly indicated that regulated proteolysis plays an important role for proper regulation of TGF-β signaling by targeting different components of this pathway for destruction by the 26 S proteasome. For example, the pool of activated Smad2 in a TGF-β-treated cell is targeted in the nucleus for ubiquitination-dependent degradation, thus providing a mechanism to reset the Smad2 pathway for interpretation of subsequent TGF-β signals (35Lo R.S. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Google Scholar). The ubiquitination-dependent degradation may also play a role during tumor progression because the steady-state level of Smad2 can be decreased in a Smad2 mutant found in colorectal cancer (32Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Google Scholar) and harboring an arginine to cysteine mutation at position 133 in the MH1 domain. A similar mechanism has been proposed to explain the inability of a tumorderived mutation detected in the MH2 domain of Smad2 (Smad2.L440R) (24Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cell. 1996; 86: 543-552Google Scholar, 32Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Google Scholar) to mediate the TGF-β response, supporting the general notion that the loss of Smad2 function may contribute to the development of tumors. In these respects, Smad2.Q407R was closely similar to Smad2.L440R, as the finding outlined in the present data strongly suggests that the Q407R mutation in Smad2 generates a protein with increased susceptibility to degradation through the proteasome pathway. Consistently, degradation of the Smad2.Q407R was prevented by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and the level of Smad2.Q407R was stabilized by overexpression of catalytically inactive versions of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a, UbcH5b, and UbcH5c. These mutants, which harbor an active Cys to Ala mutation, behave in a dominant-negative manner and have been shown to suppress the degradation of Smad2 protein by the proteasome (34Gonen H. Bercovich B. Orian A. Carrano A. Takizawa C. Yamanaka K. Pagano M. Iwai K. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14823-14830Google Scholar). In the present study, we also provide evidence demonstrating that the wild-type allele can suppress the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of some tumor-derived mutation of Smad2 (i.e. Smad2.Q407R and Smad2.L440R). This protective effect may occur in the absence of Smad2 phosphorylation by the activated type I receptor and its subsequent hetero-oligomerization with Smad4. Of note, the homo-oligomerization of Smad2 was independent of TGF-β signaling in 293T cells, like in other overexpression systems such as COS cells (13Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that the homo-oligomerization of Smad2.Q407R with wild-type Smad2 may play a critical role in suppressing the ability of the mutation Q407R to enhance the degradation of Smad2 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Consistent with this interpretation, we observed that coexpression of Smad2.D450E, a tumor-derived mutation unable to form homomer complexes, failed to stabilize Smad2.Q407R compared with wild-type Smad2. The physiological relevance of this phenomenon was demonstrated by showing that endogenous wild-type Smad2 prevent the degradation of the tumor-derived mutant Smad2.Q407R, using immortalized mouse embryonic cells from Smad2 wild-type (Smad2+/+) or knock-out (Smad2–/–) mice. Mutations in Smad2 and Smad4 genes, but not that of Smad3, have been detected in several carcinomas, suggesting that Smad2 and Smad4 function as tumor suppressor genes. Cells deficient in Smad3, or expressing a mutant dominant-negative Smad3 in which its three carboxyl-terminal serines are changed to alanines, are unable to induce transcription from TGF-β-responsive promoter constructs (38Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Google Scholar, 39Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 201-204Google Scholar), and are resistant to the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β. Furthermore, mice with homozygous inactivating mutations of Smad3 have been shown to develop colon carcinoma (40Zhu Y. Richardson J.A. Parada L.F. Graff J.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 703-714Google Scholar), consistent with its role as mediator of TGF-β growth inhibitory responses. Although a role of Smad3 as a tumor suppressor gene is conceivable, no inactivating Smad3 mutations have been observed in human tumors. In the present study, we show that expression of Smad3 can block the degradation of the missense mutation Smad2.Q407R through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. At present, the molecular mechanisms whereby Smad3 protect the mutation Smad2.Q407R are unknown. Given the similarity in terms of sequence between Smad2 and Smad3 (over 91% identity), and the observation that Smad2 and Smad3 can form heteromers, one attractive possibility is that Smad3 might associate with Smad2.Q407R, resulting in a decreased accessibility to this mutant by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Regardless of the mechanism, the results outlined in the present study provide the first evidence that Smad3 can overcome at least one genetic defect observed in the related suppressor gene Smad2 during tumor development. We believe that this newly identified function of Smad3 is very interesting, because this mechanism would allow cells to display the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β, whose loss may led to dysregulated cell proliferation. We thank Dr E. Böttinger for providing the immortalized mouse embryonic cells from Smad2 wild-type and knock-out mice."
