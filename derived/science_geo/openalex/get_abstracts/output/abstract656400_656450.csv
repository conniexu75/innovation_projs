https://openalex.org/W3044660350,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues, with devasting consequences for human lives and the global economy1,2. The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of sixty-one SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to hospital with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these are nineteen antibodies that potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, nine of which exhibited very high potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng ml−1. Epitope mapping showed that this collection of nineteen antibodies was about equally divided between those directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody that targets the RBD, a second that targets the NTD, and a third that bridges two separate RBDs showed that the antibodies recognize the closed, ‘all RBD-down’ conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2. A diverse collection of potent neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been isolated from five patients with severe COVID-19 and high serum neutralization titres."
https://openalex.org/W3105895682,"The quantum-level interplay between geometry, topology and correlation is at the forefront of fundamental physics1-15. Kagome magnets are predicted to support intrinsic Chern quantum phases owing to their unusual lattice geometry and breaking of time-reversal symmetry14,15. However, quantum materials hosting ideal spin-orbit-coupled kagome lattices with strong out-of-plane magnetization are lacking16-21. Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we identify a new topological kagome magnet, TbMn6Sn6, that is close to satisfying these criteria. We visualize its effectively defect-free, purely manganese-based ferromagnetic kagome lattice with atomic resolution. Remarkably, its electronic state shows distinct Landau quantization on application of a magnetic field, and the quantized Landau fan structure features spin-polarized Dirac dispersion with a large Chern gap. We further demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence between the Chern gap and the topological edge state, as well as the Berry curvature field correspondence of Chern gapped Dirac fermions. Our results point to the realization of a quantum-limit Chern phase in TbMn6Sn6, and may enable the observation of topological quantum phenomena in the RMn6Sn6 (where R is a rare earth element) family with a variety of magnetic structures. Our visualization of the magnetic bulk-boundary-Berry correspondence covering real space and momentum space demonstrates a proof-of-principle method for revealing topological magnets."
https://openalex.org/W3045151714,"Thermosets—polymeric materials that adopt a permanent shape upon curing—have a key role in the modern plastics and rubber industries, comprising about 20 per cent of polymeric materials manufactured today, with a worldwide annual production of about 65 million tons1,2. The high density of crosslinks that gives thermosets their useful properties (for example, chemical and thermal resistance and tensile strength) comes at the expense of degradability and recyclability. Here, using the industrial thermoset polydicyclopentadiene as a model system, we show that when a small number of cleavable bonds are selectively installed within the strands of thermosets using a comonomer additive in otherwise traditional curing workflows, the resulting materials can display the same mechanical properties as the native material, but they can undergo triggered, mild degradation to yield soluble, recyclable products of controlled size and functionality. By contrast, installation of cleavable crosslinks, even at much higher loadings, does not produce degradable materials. These findings reveal that optimization of the cleavable bond location can be used as a design principle to achieve controlled thermoset degradation. Moreover, we introduce a class of recyclable thermosets poised for rapid deployment. A method of endowing thermoset plastics with a degree of recyclability and reprocessability by incorporating cleavable chemical linkages in the strands of the polymer, rather than in the crosslinks, is presented."
https://openalex.org/W3083062286,"The electron-hole plasma in charge-neutral graphene is predicted to realize a quantum critical system whose transport features a universal hydrodynamic description, even at room temperature. This quantum critical ""Dirac fluid"" is expected to have a shear viscosity close to a minimum bound, with an inter-particle scattering rate saturating at the Planckian time $\hbar/(k_B T)$. While electrical transport measurements at finite carrier density are consistent with hydrodynamic electron flow in graphene, a ""smoking gun"" of viscous behavior remains elusive. In this work, we directly image viscous Dirac fluid flow in graphene at room temperature via measurement of the associated stray magnetic field. Nanoscale magnetic imaging is performed using quantum spin magnetometers realized with nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Scanning single-spin and wide-field magnetometry reveals a parabolic Poiseuille profile for electron flow in a graphene channel near the charge neutrality point, establishing the viscous transport of the Dirac fluid. This measurement is in contrast to the conventional uniform flow profile imaged in an Ohmic conductor. Via combined imaging-transport measurements, we obtain viscosity and scattering rates, and observe that these quantities are comparable to the universal values expected at quantum criticality. This finding establishes a nearly-ideal electron fluid in neutral graphene at room temperature. Our results pave the way to study hydrodynamic transport in quantum critical fluids relevant to strongly-correlated electrons in high-$T_c$ superconductors. This work also highlights the capability of quantum spin magnetometers to probe correlated-electronic phenomena at the nanoscale."
https://openalex.org/W3035280753,"Abstract Bats possess extraordinary adaptations, including flight, echolocation, extreme longevity and unique immunity. High-quality genomes are crucial for understanding the molecular basis and evolution of these traits. Here we incorporated long-read sequencing and state-of-the-art scaffolding protocols 1 to generate, to our knowledge, the first reference-quality genomes of six bat species ( Rhinolophus ferrumequinum , Rousettus aegyptiacus , Phyllostomus discolor , Myotis myotis , Pipistrellus kuhlii and Molossus molossus ). We integrated gene projections from our ‘Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments’ (TOGA) software with de novo and homology gene predictions as well as short- and long-read transcriptomics to generate highly complete gene annotations. To resolve the phylogenetic position of bats within Laurasiatheria, we applied several phylogenetic methods to comprehensive sets of orthologous protein-coding and noncoding regions of the genome, and identified a basal origin for bats within Scrotifera. Our genome-wide screens revealed positive selection on hearing-related genes in the ancestral branch of bats, which is indicative of laryngeal echolocation being an ancestral trait in this clade. We found selection and loss of immunity-related genes (including pro-inflammatory NF-κB regulators) and expansions of anti-viral APOBEC3 genes, which highlights molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the exceptional immunity of bats. Genomic integrations of diverse viruses provide a genomic record of historical tolerance to viral infection in bats. Finally, we found and experimentally validated bat-specific variation in microRNAs, which may regulate bat-specific gene-expression programs. Our reference-quality bat genomes provide the resources required to uncover and validate the genomic basis of adaptations of bats, and stimulate new avenues of research that are directly relevant to human health and disease 1 ."
https://openalex.org/W3044165755,"Decades of overexploitation have devastated shark populations, leaving considerable doubt as to their ecological status1,2. Yet much of what is known about sharks has been inferred from catch records in industrial fisheries, whereas far less information is available about sharks that live in coastal habitats3. Here we address this knowledge gap using data from more than 15,000 standardized baited remote underwater video stations that were deployed on 371 reefs in 58 nations to estimate the conservation status of reef sharks globally. Our results reveal the profound impact that fishing has had on reef shark populations: we observed no sharks on almost 20% of the surveyed reefs. Reef sharks were almost completely absent from reefs in several nations, and shark depletion was strongly related to socio-economic conditions such as the size and proximity of the nearest market, poor governance and the density of the human population. However, opportunities for the conservation of reef sharks remain: shark sanctuaries, closed areas, catch limits and an absence of gillnets and longlines were associated with a substantially higher relative abundance of reef sharks. These results reveal several policy pathways for the restoration and management of reef shark populations, from direct top-down management of fishing to indirect improvement of governance conditions. Reef shark populations will only have a high chance of recovery by engaging key socio-economic aspects of tropical fisheries. Fishing has had a profound impact on global reef shark populations, and the absence or presence of sharks is strongly correlated with national socio-economic conditions and reef governance."

https://openalex.org/W3043868445,"There are concerns that recent climate change is altering the frequency and magnitude of river floods in an unprecedented way1. Historical studies have identified flood-rich periods in the past half millennium in various regions of Europe2. However, because of the low temporal resolution of existing datasets and the relatively low number of series, it has remained unclear whether Europe is currently in a flood-rich period from a long-term perspective. Here we analyse how recent decades compare with the flood history of Europe, using a new database composed of more than 100 high-resolution (sub-annual) historical flood series based on documentary evidence covering all major regions of Europe. We show that the past three decades were among the most flood-rich periods in Europe in the past 500 years, and that this period differs from other flood-rich periods in terms of its extent, air temperatures and flood seasonality. We identified nine flood-rich periods and associated regions. Among the periods richest in floods are 1560–1580 (western and central Europe), 1760–1800 (most of Europe), 1840–1870 (western and southern Europe) and 1990–2016 (western and central Europe). In most parts of Europe, previous flood-rich periods occurred during cooler-than-usual phases, but the current flood-rich period has been much warmer. Flood seasonality is also more pronounced in the recent period. For example, during previous flood and interflood periods, 41 per cent and 42 per cent of central European floods occurred in summer, respectively, compared with 55 per cent of floods in the recent period. The exceptional nature of the present-day flood-rich period calls for process-based tools for flood-risk assessment that capture the physical mechanisms involved, and management strategies that can incorporate the recent changes in risk. Analysis of thousands of historical documents recording floods in Europe shows that flooding characteristics in recent decades are unlike those of previous centuries."
https://openalex.org/W3044486709,"Few complete pathways have been established for the biosynthesis of medicinal compounds from plants. Accordingly, many plant-derived therapeutics are isolated directly from medicinal plants or plant cell culture1. A lead example is colchicine, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for inflammatory disorders that is sourced from Colchicum and Gloriosa species2-5. Here we use a combination of transcriptomics, metabolic logic and pathway reconstitution to elucidate a near-complete biosynthetic pathway to colchicine without prior knowledge of biosynthetic genes, a sequenced genome or genetic tools in the native host. We uncovered eight genes from Gloriosa superba for the biosynthesis of N-formyldemecolcine, a colchicine precursor that contains the characteristic tropolone ring and pharmacophore of colchicine6. Notably, we identified a non-canonical cytochrome P450 that catalyses the remarkable ring expansion reaction that is required to produce the distinct carbon scaffold of colchicine. We further used the newly identified genes to engineer a biosynthetic pathway (comprising 16 enzymes in total) to N-formyldemecolcine in Nicotiana benthamiana starting from the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. This study establishes a metabolic route to tropolone-containing colchicine alkaloids and provides insights into the unique chemistry that plants use to generate complex, bioactive metabolites from simple amino acids."

https://openalex.org/W3044267291,"The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), the major source of thalamic inhibition, regulates thalamocortical interactions that are critical for sensory processing, attention and cognition1-5. TRN dysfunction has been linked to sensory abnormality, attention deficit and sleep disturbance across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders6-9. However, little is known about the organizational principles that underlie its divergent functions. Here we performed an integrative study linking single-cell molecular and electrophysiological features of the mouse TRN to connectivity and systems-level function. We found that cellular heterogeneity in the TRN is characterized by a transcriptomic gradient of two negatively correlated gene-expression profiles, each containing hundreds of genes. Neurons in the extremes of this transcriptomic gradient express mutually exclusive markers, exhibit core or shell-like anatomical structure and have distinct electrophysiological properties. The two TRN subpopulations make differential connections with the functionally distinct first-order and higher-order thalamic nuclei to form molecularly defined TRN-thalamus subnetworks. Selective perturbation of the two subnetworks in vivo revealed their differential role in regulating sleep. In sum, our study provides a comprehensive atlas of TRN neurons at single-cell resolution and links molecularly defined subnetworks to the functional organization of thalamocortical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W3045427965,"Complex organisms can rapidly induce select genes in response to diverse environmental cues. This regulation occurs in the context of large genomes condensed by histone proteins into chromatin. The sensing of pathogens by macrophages engages conserved signalling pathways and transcription factors to coordinate the induction of inflammatory genes1-3. Enriched integration of histone H3.3, the ancestral histone H3 variant, is a general feature of dynamically regulated chromatin and transcription4-7. However, how chromatin is regulated at induced genes, and what features of H3.3 might enable rapid and high-level transcription, are unknown. The amino terminus of H3.3 contains a unique serine residue (Ser31) that is absent in 'canonical' H3.1 and H3.2. Here we show that this residue, H3.3S31, is phosphorylated (H3.3S31ph) in a stimulation-dependent manner along rapidly induced genes in mouse macrophages. This selective mark of stimulation-responsive genes directly engages the histone methyltransferase SETD2, a component of the active transcription machinery, and 'ejects' the elongation corepressor ZMYND118,9. We propose that features of H3.3 at stimulation-induced genes, including H3.3S31ph, provide preferential access to the transcription apparatus. Our results indicate dedicated mechanisms that enable rapid transcription involving the histone variant H3.3, its phosphorylation, and both the recruitment and the ejection of chromatin regulators."
https://openalex.org/W3035515218,"A relatively small number of proteins have been suggested to act as morphogens—signalling molecules that spread within tissues to organize tissue repair and the specification of cell fate during development. Among them are Wnt proteins, which carry a palmitoleate moiety that is essential for signalling activity1–3. How a hydrophobic lipoprotein can spread in the aqueous extracellular space is unknown. Several mechanisms, such as those involving lipoprotein particles, exosomes or a specific chaperone, have been proposed to overcome this so-called Wnt solubility problem4–6. Here we provide evidence against these models and show that the Wnt lipid is shielded by the core domain of a subclass of glypicans defined by the Dally-like protein (Dlp). Structural analysis shows that, in the presence of palmitoleoylated peptides, these glypicans change conformation to create a hydrophobic space. Thus, glypicans of the Dlp family protect the lipid of Wnt proteins from the aqueous environment and serve as a reservoir from which Wnt proteins can be handed over to signalling receptors. Genetic studies in Drosophila combined with structural analyses show that glypicans bind palmitoylate moieties in Wnt ligands, and thus shield Wnt ligands from their aqueous environments to enable them to signal to their distant receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3045316332,"Most sensory information destined for the neocortex is relayed through the thalamus, where considerable transformation occurs1,2. One means of transformation involves interactions between excitatory thalamocortical neurons that carry data to the cortex and inhibitory neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) that regulate the flow of those data3-6. Although the importance of the TRN has long been recognised7-9, understanding of its cell types, their organization and their functional properties has lagged behind that of the thalamocortical systems they control. Here we address this by investigating the somatosensory and visual circuits of the TRN in mice. In the somatosensory TRN we observed two groups of genetically defined neurons that are topographically segregated and physiologically distinct, and that connect reciprocally with independent thalamocortical nuclei through dynamically divergent synapses. Calbindin-expressing cells-located in the central core-connect with the ventral posterior nucleus, the primary somatosensory thalamocortical relay. By contrast, somatostatin-expressing cells-which reside along the surrounding edges of the TRN-synapse with the posterior medial thalamic nucleus, a higher-order structure that carries both top-down and bottom-up information10-12. The two TRN cell groups process their inputs in pathway-specific ways. Synapses from the ventral posterior nucleus to central TRN cells transmit rapid excitatory currents that depress deeply during repetitive activity, driving phasic spike output. Synapses from the posterior medial thalamic nucleus to edge TRN cells evoke slower, less depressing excitatory currents that drive more persistent spiking. Differences in the intrinsic physiology of TRN cell types, including state-dependent bursting, contribute to these output dynamics. The processing specializations of these two somatosensory TRN subcircuits therefore appear to be tuned to the signals they carry-a primary central subcircuit tuned to discrete sensory events, and a higher-order edge subcircuit tuned to temporally distributed signals integrated from multiple sources. The structure and function of visual TRN subcircuits closely resemble those of the somatosensory TRN. These results provide insights into how subnetworks of TRN neurons may differentially process distinct classes of thalamic information."
https://openalex.org/W3044057891,"Malignant transformation of cells typically involves several genetic lesions, whose combined activity gives rise to cancer1. Here we analyse 1,148 patient-derived B-cell leukaemia (B-ALL) samples, and find that individual mutations do not promote leukaemogenesis unless they converge on one single oncogenic pathway that is characteristic of the differentiation stage of transformed B cells. Mutations that are not aligned with this central oncogenic driver activate divergent pathways and subvert transformation. Oncogenic lesions in B-ALL frequently mimic signalling through cytokine receptors at the pro-B-cell stage (via activation of the signal-transduction protein STAT5)2–4 or pre-B-cell receptors in more mature cells (via activation of the protein kinase ERK)5–8. STAT5- and ERK-activating lesions are found frequently, but occur together in only around 3% of cases (P = 2.2 × 10−16). Single-cell mutation and phospho-protein analyses reveal the segregation of oncogenic STAT5 and ERK activation to competing clones. STAT5 and ERK engage opposing biochemical and transcriptional programs that are orchestrated by the transcription factors MYC and BCL6, respectively. Genetic reactivation of the divergent (suppressed) pathway comes at the expense of the principal oncogenic driver and reverses transformation. Conversely, deletion of divergent pathway components accelerates leukaemogenesis. Thus, persistence of divergent signalling pathways represents a powerful barrier to transformation, while convergence on one principal driver defines a central event in leukaemia initiation. Pharmacological reactivation of suppressed divergent circuits synergizes strongly with inhibition of the principal oncogenic driver. Hence, reactivation of divergent pathways can be leveraged as a previously unrecognized strategy to enhance treatment responses. Analysis of B-cell leukaemia samples reveals that oncogenic mutations do not cause malignant transformation unless they converge on the same signalling pathway, and that it may be possible clinically to combine inhibition of the principal oncogenic driver with reactivation of divergent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3044552023,"Given the rising evidence that gut malfunction including changes in the gut microbiota composition, plays a major role in the development of obesity and associated metabolic diseases, the exploring of novel probiotic bacteria with potential health benefits has attracted great attention. Recently Lactobacillus spp., exert potent anti-obesity effects by regulating key transcriptional and translational factors in adipose tissues. However, the molecular mechanism behind the anti-obesity effect of probiotics is not yet fully understood. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus plantarum A29 on the expression of adipogenic and lipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. We observed that the treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the cell-free metabolites of L plantarum inhibited their differentiation and fat depositions via downregulating the key adipogenic transcriptional factors (PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, and C/EBP-β) and their downstream targets (FAS, aP2, ACC, and SREBP-1). Interestingly, supplementation with L plantarum reduced the fat mass and serum lipid profile concurrently with downregulation of lipogenic gene expression in the adipocytes, resulting in reductions in the bodyweight of HFD-fed obese mice. L plantarum treatment attenuated the development of obesity in HFD-fed mice via the activation of p38MAPK, p44/42, and AMPK-α by increasing their phosphorylation. Further analysis revealed that A29 modulated gut-associated microbiota composition. Thus, A 29 potential probiotic strain may alleviate the obesity development and its associated metabolic disorders via inhibiting PPARγ through activating the p38MAPK and p44/42 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3044426260,"Efforts to improve sea level forecasting on a warming planet have focused on determining the temperature, sea level and extent of polar ice sheets during Earth's past interglacial warm periods1-3. About 400,000 years ago, during the interglacial period known as Marine Isotopic Stage 11 (MIS11), the global temperature was 1 to 2 degrees Celsius greater2 and sea level was 6 to 13 metres higher1,3. Sea level estimates in excess of about 10 metres, however, have been discounted because these require a contribution from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet3, which has been argued to have remained stable for millions of years before and includes MIS114,5. Here we show how the evolution of 234U enrichment within the subglacial waters of East Antarctica recorded the ice sheet's response to MIS11 warming. Within the Wilkes Basin, subglacial chemical precipitates of opal and calcite record accumulation of 234U (the product of rock-water contact within an isolated subglacial reservoir) up to 20 times higher than that found in marine waters. The timescales of 234U enrichment place the inception of this reservoir at MIS11. Informed by the 234U cycling observed in the Laurentide Ice Sheet, where 234U accumulated during periods of ice stability6 and was flushed to global oceans in response to deglaciation7, we interpret our East Antarctic dataset to represent ice loss within the Wilkes Basin at MIS11. The 234U accumulation within the Wilkes Basin is also observed in the McMurdo Dry Valleys brines8-10, indicating11 that the brine originated beneath the adjacent East Antarctic Ice Sheet. The marine origin of brine salts10 and bacteria12 implies that MIS11 ice loss was coupled with marine flooding. Collectively, these data indicate that during one of the warmest Pleistocene interglacials, the ice sheet margin at the Wilkes Basin retreated to near the precipitate location, about 700 kilometres inland from the current position of the ice margin, which-assuming current ice volumes-would have contributed about 3 to 4 metres13 to global sea levels."

ABCB transporters are critical for this polar auxin distribution, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling their function is not fully understood.

Currently, it is not known how many of the remaining 15 full-size ABCBs and 7 half-size ABCBs in Arabidopsis function as well as auxin transporters (Fig. S1). All characterized auxin transporters have been shown to be regulated on the transcriptional and nontranscriptional level (9Geisler M. Bailly A. Ivanchenko M. Master and servant: Regulation of auxin transporters by FKBPs and cyclophilins.Plant Sci. 2016; 245 (26940487): 1-1010.1016/j.plantsci.2015.12.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Titapiwatanakun B.

PM PINs and ABCBs were shown to be regulated by a partially overlapping subset of members of the AGC kinase family (26Henrichs S. Wang B. Fukao Y. Zhu J. Charrier L. Bailly A. Oehring S.C. Linnert M. Weiwad M. Endler A. Nanni P. Pollmann S. Mancuso S. Schulz A. Geisler M.

Whereas protein phosphorylation of the central PIN loop seems to alter both their polarity and transport activity (28Rademacher E.H. Offringa R. Evolutionary adaptations of plant AGC kinases: From light signaling to cell polarity regulation.Front. Plant Sci. 2012; 3 (23162562): 25010.3389/fpls.2012.00250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of the so-called ABCB linker has been described to result only in activity changes (26Henrichs S.

Further, PINs and ABCBs seem to be also regulated by protein-protein interaction with cis-trans peptidylprolyl isomerases (PPIases), which are formed by three evolutionary unrelated families: the cyclophilins, the FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), and the parvulins (9Geisler M. Bailly A. Ivanchenko M. Master and servant: Regulation of auxin transporters by FKBPs and cyclophilins.Plant Sci. 2016; 245 (26940487): 1-1010.1016/j.plantsci.2015.12.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cyclophilin, diageotropica (DGT/CypA), seems to decrease the functionality of PINs and their presence on the PM (29Ivanchenko M.G. Zhu J. Wang B. Medvecká E. Du Y. Azzarello E. Mancuso S. Megraw M. Filichkin S. Dubrovsky J.G. Friml J. Geisler M. The cyclophilin A DIAGEOTROPICA gene affects auxin transport in both root and shoot to control lateral root formation.Development. 2015; 142 (25617431): 712-72110.1242/dev.113225Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), although underlying mechanisms are far from being understood. Further, the parvulin PIN1At was shown to affect PIN1 polarity by means of its PPIase activity (30Xi W. Gong X. Yang Q. Yu H. Liou Y.C. Pin1At regulates PIN1 polar localization and root gravitropism.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (26791759): 1043010.1038/ncomms10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, biogenesis of the ATAs, ABCB1, 4, 19, was found to depend on the FKBP42, twisted dwarf1 ((TWD1)/ultracurvata 2). The latter concept is based on the finding that ABCB1, 4, and 19 are retained on the ER and degraded in twd1 (31Wang B. Bailly A. Zwiewka M. Henrichs S. Azzarello E. Mancuso S. Maeshima M. Friml J. Schulz A. Geisler M. Arabidopsis TWISTED DWARF1 functionally interacts with auxin exporter ABCB1 on the root plasma membrane.Plant Cell. 2013; 25 (23321285): 202-21410.1105/tpc.112.105999Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Wu G.

This model is further supported by that fact that twd1 and abcb1,19 plants reveal widely overlapping but not entirely identical auxin-related phenotypes, including dwarfism and a nonhanded helical rotation of the epidermal cell files, designated as epidermal “twisting” (31Wang B.

TWD1 was shown to interact physically via its PPIase/FK506-binding (FKB) domain with the C-terminal nucleotide-binding fold (NBD2) (Fig. 1) of ABCB1; however, the exact mechanism through which TWD1 regulates ABCB biogenesis and/or auxin transport is not yet known. High-molecular-weight FKBPs usually possess PPIase activity that is associated with the FKB domain (33Geisler M. Bailly A. Tête-à-tête: The function of FKBPs in plant development.Trends Plant.

The latter was demonstrated for TWD1 (35Kamphausen T. Fanghänel J. Neumann D. Schulz B. Rahfeld J.U.

Interestingly, the proposed chaperone-like function for TWD1 during ER to plasma membrane trafficking of ABCBs is an analogy with the functional ortholog of TWD1/FBP42 in humans, FKBP38/FKBP8, that shares with TWD1/FKBP42 a unique mode of membrane anchoring (37Banasavadi-Siddegowda Y.K.

It has been suggested that FKBP38 may play a dual role during these events by negatively regulating CFTR synthesis and positively regulating ER-associated maturation of WT and mutated form of CFTR (41Pranke I.M.

https://openalex.org/W3044540098,"Phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) are a class of mycobacterial lipids that promote virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum. It has recently been shown that PDIMs work in concert with the M. tuberculosis Type VII secretion system ESX-1 to permeabilize the phagosomal membranes of infected macrophages. As the zebrafish-M. marinum model of infection has revealed the critical role of PDIM at the host-pathogen interface, we set to determine if PDIMs contributed to phagosomal permeabilization in M. marinum. Using an ΔmmpL7 mutant defective in PDIM transport, we find the PDIM-ESX-1 interaction to be conserved in an M. marinum macrophage infection model. However, we find PDIM and ESX-1 mutants differ in their degree of defect, with the PDIM mutant retaining more membrane damaging activity. Using an in vitro hemolysis assay—a common surrogate for cytolytic activity, we find that PDIM and ESX-1 differ in their contributions: the ESX-1 mutant loses hemolytic activity while PDIM retains it. Our observations confirm the involvement of PDIMs in phagosomal permeabilization in M. marinum infection and suggest that PDIM enhances the membrane disrupting activity of pathogenic mycobacteria and indicates that the role they play in damaging phagosomal and red blood cell membranes may differ."
https://openalex.org/W3044665866,"Soil salinity imposes an agricultural and economic burden that may be alleviated by identifying the components of salinity tolerance in barley, a major crop and the most salt tolerant cereal. To improve our understanding of these components, we evaluated a diversity panel of 377 two-row spring barley cultivars during both the vegetative, in a controlled environment, and the reproductive stages, in the field. In the controlled environment, a high-throughput phenotyping platform was used to assess the growth-related traits under both control and saline conditions. In the field, the agronomic traits were measured from plots irrigated with either fresh or saline water. Association mapping for the different components of salinity tolerance enabled us to detect previously known associations, such as HvHKT1;5. Using an “interaction model”, which took into account the interaction between treatment (control and salt) and genetic markers, we identified several loci associated with yield components related to salinity tolerance. We also observed that the two developmental stages did not share genetic regions associated with the components of salinity tolerance, suggesting that different mechanisms play distinct roles throughout the barley life cycle. Our association analysis revealed that genetically defined regions containing known flowering genes (Vrn-H3, Vrn-H1, and HvNAM-1) were responsive to salt stress. We identified a salt-responsive locus (7H, 128.35 cM) that was associated with grain number per ear, and suggest a gene encoding a vacuolar H+-translocating pyrophosphatase, HVP1, as a candidate. We also found a new QTL on chromosome 3H (139.22 cM), which was significant for ear number per plant, and a locus on chromosome 2H (141.87 cM), previously identified using a nested association mapping population, which associated with a yield component and interacted with salinity stress. Our study is the first to evaluate a barley diversity panel for salinity stress under both controlled and field conditions, allowing us to identify contributions from new components of salinity tolerance which could be used for marker-assisted selection when breeding for marginal and saline regions."
https://openalex.org/W3043912809,"Background and aims Alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH)-the inflammation of fatty liver-is caused by chronic alcohol consumption and represents one of the leading chronic liver diseases in Western Countries. ASH can lead to organ dysfunction or progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Long-term alcohol abstinence reduces this probability and is the prerequisite for liver transplantation-the only effective therapy option at present. Elevated enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is known to be critically responsible for the development of ASH due to excessively high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during metabolization of ethanol. Up to now, no rational drug discovery process was successfully initiated to target CYP2E1 for the treatment of ASH. Methods In this study, we applied a rational drug design concept to develop drug candidates (NCE) including preclinical studies. Results A new class of drug candidates was generated successfully. Two of the most promising small compounds named 12-Imidazolyl-1-dodecanol (abbr.: I-ol) and 1-Imidazolyldodecane (abbr.: I-an) were selected at the end of this process of drug discovery and developability. These new ω-imidazolyl-alkyl derivatives act as strong chimeric CYP2E1 inhibitors at a nanomolar range. They restore redox balance, reduce inflammation process as well as the fat content in the liver and rescue the physiological liver architecture of rats consuming continuously a high amount of alcohol. Conclusions Due to its oral application and therapeutic superiority over an off-label use of the hepatoprotector ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), this new class of inhibitors marks the first rational, pharmaceutical concept in long-term treatment of ASH."
https://openalex.org/W3044409733,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease inducing dystrophy of the motor system. Automatic movement analysis systems have potential in improving patient care by enabling personalized and more accurate adjust of treatment. These systems utilize machine learning to classify the movement properties based on the features derived from the signals. Smartphones can provide an inexpensive measurement platform with their built-in sensors for movement assessment. This study compared three feature selection and nine classification methods for identifying PD patients from control subjects based on accelerometer and gyroscope signals measured with a smartphone during a 20-step walking test. Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and sequential feature selection with both forward (SFS) and backward (SBS) propagation directions were used in this study. The number of selected features was narrowed down from 201 to 4–15 features by applying SFS and mRMR methods. From the methods compared in this study, the highest accuracy for individual steps was achieved with SFS (7 features) and Naive Bayes classifier (accuracy 75.3%), and the second highest accuracy with SFS (4 features) and k Nearest neighbours (accuracy 75.1%). Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was used in the analysis. For the overall classification of each subject, which was based on the majority vote of the classified steps, k Nearest Neighbors provided the most accurate result with an accuracy of 84.5% and an error rate of 15.5%. This study shows the differences in feature selection methods and classifiers and provides generalizations for optimizing methodologies for smartphone-based monitoring of PD patients. The results are promising for further developing the analysis system for longer measurements carried out in free-living conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3045253118,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) is a widely used forage grass which shares a symbiosis with the endophytic fungus Epichloë coenophiala. The endophyte produces an alkaloid toxin that provides herbivory, heat and drought resistance to the grass, but can cause fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock. Fescue toxicosis can lead to reduced weight gain and milk yields resulting in significant losses to the livestock industry. The objective of this study was to identify bacterial and fungal communities associated with fescue toxicosis tolerance. In this trial, 149 Angus cows across two farms were continuously exposed to toxic, endophyte-infected, fescue for a total of 13 weeks. Of those 149 cows, 40 were classified into either high (HT) or low (LT) tolerance groups according to their growth performance (weight gain). 20 HT and 20 LT cattle balanced by farm were selected for amplicon sequencing to compare the fecal microbiota of the two tolerance groups. This study reveals significantly (q<0.05) different bacterial and fungal microbiota between HT and LT cattle, and indicates that fungal phylotypes may be important for an animal's response to fescue toxicosis: We found that fungal phylotypes affiliating to the Neocallimastigaceae, which are known to be important fiber-degrading fungi, were consistently more abundant in the HT cattle. Whereas fungal phylotypes related to the genus Thelebolus were more abundant in the LT cattle. This study also found more pronounced shifts in the microbiota in animals receiving higher amounts of the toxin. We identified fungal phylotypes which were consistently more abundant either in HT or LT cattle and may thus be associated with the respective animal's response to fescue toxicosis. Our results thus suggest that some fungal phylotypes might be involved in mitigating fescue toxicosis."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, a neurological disorder that is currently believed to affect 35.6 million people worldwide and estimated to triple by 2050. A key neuropathological hallmark of AD and other tauopathies is the abnormal folding and hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein, which leads to generation of Tau filaments and neurofibrillary tangles. During the clinical manifestation of AD, a temporospatial spreading of Tau-positive neurofibrillary lesions is observed, suggesting that once Tau pathology is initiated it may spread along the axonal network and propagate between connected neuronal cells; moreover, the extent of Tau pathology strongly correlates with symptom severity and neuronal cell loss (1Braak H.

According to this staging system, hyperphosphorylated Tau accumulates first in the entorhinal cortex and locus coeruleus before the disease becomes symptomatic; the propagation of Tau pathology beyond entorhinal cortex and locus coeruleus by neuron-to-neuron transmission is initiated after accumulation of a high β-amyloid load in isocortical regions and is associated with symptoms of AD, according to pathological, clinical, and biomarker data (4Vasconcelos B.

Cellular and animal models recapitulating features of tauopathies provide a useful tool to investigate the causes and consequences of Tau aggregation. Cellular models are useful for understanding disease mechanisms, screening, and profiling compounds that interfere with Tau aggregation.

Typically, to facilitate neuronal culture, microfluidic devices are fabricated using gas-permeable silicone elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The most common device layout used to create synaptically connected but environmentally isolated neuronal populations (18Robertson G. Bushell T.J. Zagnoni M.

This structure enables axons from one culture compartment to form synaptic connections with dendrites from the other compartment. The main positive features of the microfluidic platform are small reaction volumes, leading to minimal reagent usage, and the control over spatial and temporal separation of neuronal populations, which allows simulation of a neuronal network (22Zilberzwige-Tal S.

Because one of the main pathophysiological characteristics of AD is neuronal cell death with loss of synapses and neuronal network within the brain, microfluidic devices provide an ideal platform to study neuronal connectivity and spread of Tau pathology.

However, quantification of Tau pathology and spreading in these models was challenging, the robustness of the signal window could not be determined, and the throughput of the assays was minimal. Here, we designed microfluidic plates so that the user could handle 16 two-chamber devices simultaneously in the footprint of a standard 96-well plate, thus increasing throughput of information and facilitating interfacing with high-content imaging (HCI) equipment. We used primary nontransgenic rat cortical neurons (RCNs) seeded with human (h) AD Tau as a model for human sporadic tauopathies and were able set up a quantifiable and reproducible imaging assay in a medium-throughput microfluidic format for detecting formation and propagation of Tau aggregates. This model system could be ideal for testing the effect of potential Tau therapeutics that modulate Tau trans-neuronal propagation. Furthermore, we believe this to be the first time that a robust, reproducible methodology has been established for quantifying aggregates in microfluidic chambers, because this technology has previously struggled with delivering quantitative outcomes. This is despite the broad and increasing use of this technology. Protein aggregate propagation is central to many neurodegenerative disease progressions; therefore, the method can be further adapted to measure propagation of any prion-like disease. To extract seeding-competent material from h AD brains, we used a Sarkosyl extraction protocol adapted from Greenberg and Davies (29Greenberg S.G. Davies P.

This purified hAD seed was analyzed via AlphaScreen to determine Tau concentration, and 18 nm (optimal concentration as shown in Fig. S1) was added to RCNs at DIV 7; their cell lysate was biochemically characterized for Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau levels at DIV 21. Western blotting analysis of their Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet demonstrates that hAD seed when added to RCNs seeds rodent Tau as shown using the rodent specific antibody, T49 (Fig. 1A) that resulted in the formation of AT8-positive, Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau (Fig. 1B). We have analyzed 3R and 4R Tau expression in a time course in RCN (Fig. S2). The expression of 3R and 4R Tau increased over time, peaking at DIV 15 and then started to decline. We hypothesize that the endogenous aggregates that would template from hAD seed (starting from DIV 7) will contain both 3R and 4R Tau. By HCI we show that when hAD seed was added to RCNs at DIV 7 and the cells were fixed at DIV 21 and stained with the same rodent specific Tau antibody T49, the hAD seed could induce neuritic thread-like inclusions in a 96-well plate assay (Fig. 1C). In summary, hAD seed can seed rodent Tau to form neuritic thread-like inclusions that are comprised of Sarkosyl-insoluble 3R and 4R Tau, consistent with findings in mouse cortical neurons (30Guo J.L.

Dendrite-specific MAP2 staining (Fig. 2, A and C) revealed no co-localization with T49 staining, whereas microtubule-specific MAP1B staining (Fig. 2, B and D) showed co-localization. Because the T49 inclusions did not co-localize with the dendrite-specific marker MAP2, we conclude that the T49-positive Tau inclusions are axonal and somatic because they co-localized with MAP1B, a neuronal marker that is present in axonal and somatic microtubules. In developing neurons, MAP1B and Tau are the main MAPs found in axons, whereas MAP2 is found in dendrites (31Avila J. Dominguez J. Diaz-Nido J.

For our initial experimental setup, RCNs were cultured over the course of 3 weeks in two-compartment PDMS microfluidic devices that were irreversibly plasma-bonded on the glass surface of 6-well imaging plates (Fig. 3A). The hAD seed was added on the seeded side, and the cells were fixed in devices; this plate format was used for HCI to detect aggregated pathological Tau at the propagation side (Fig. 3B). What is characteristic about the microfluidic devices used is that only the axons (Fig. 3C, Microtubule Associated Protein Tau (MAPT) staining) can grow through the 450-μm-long microgroove barriers that separate the two compartments but not the dendrites (Fig. 3C, MAP2 staining). This supports the idea that microfluidic devices can be used as an in vitro cellular model to study trans-neuronal and axonal propagation of aggregated Tau and is consistent with previous literature reports with recombinant and transgenic fibrils in transgenic cellular models (27Wu J.W.

Here, we have demonstrated that seeding RCNs with hAD seed results in propagation of endogenously generated rodent Tau in a microfluidic two-compartment model as revealed by a higher objective magnification (Fig. 3, D and E). Characteristically, the morphology of the aggregated neuronal Tau formed after seeding RCNs with hAD seed resembled the neuritic thread-like pathology observed previously in mouse cortical neurons (30Guo J.L. Narasimhan S. Changolkar L. He Z. Stieber A. Zhang B. Gathagan R.J. Iba M. McBride J.D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y.

Med. 2016; 213 (27810929): 2635-265410.1084/jem.20160833Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The inclusions observed in the propagation side of the microfluidic devices exhibited the same neuritic thread-like pathology as observed in the seeded side (Fig. 3, D and E) and in the 96-well assay (Fig. 1C). Optimization of the seeding concentration for the hAD seed in 96-well RCN cultures revealed that 18 nm (0.75 μg/ml) is a concentration that provides a statistically significant signal window (Fig. S1). The parameters considered were the count of T49 neuritic thread-like inclusions and the hAD seed dose response. Concentrations beyond 18 nm of hAD seed demonstrated a saturation in the signal window and occasional cell toxicity (Fig. S1). During our immunocytochemistry protocol, we used methanol as previously described (30Guo J.L. Narasimhan S. Changolkar L. He Z. Stieber A. Zhang B. Gathagan R.J. Iba M. McBride J.D. Trojanowski J.Q.

We observed diffuse background staining, mostly evident in the unseeded cells in both compartments, which could represent residual soluble protein (Fig. 3, D and E). Furthermore, to determine whether the propagation observed is a real effect and not an artifact of the two-compartment model caused by the axonal growth being longer than the microgrooves distance, three-compartment microfluidic devices were used, keeping the experimental parameters consistent with the two-compartment model described above. When RCNs were plated in the first (C1), middle (C2), and third (C3) compartments, hAD seed was added to C1 on DIV 7, and cells were fixed on DIV 21, T49 staining revealed inclusions in C3 (Fig. 4B). When RCNs were plated only in C1 and C3, leaving the middle compartment C2 empty, T49 staining revealed no inclusions in C3 (Fig. 4C). Plating cells only in the outer chambers decreased the probability of forming synapses, suggesting that a lack of synapse formation is a barrier to propagation, consistent with findings by Calafate et al. (7Calafate S. Buist A. Miskiewicz K. Vijayan V. Daneels G. de Strooper B. de Wit J. Verstreken P. Moechars D. Synaptic contacts enhance cell-to-cell Tau pathology propagation.Cell Rep. 2015; 11 (25981034): 1176-118310.1016/j.celrep.2015.04.043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, neuritic inclusions are observed in C2. This could be because axons that grow through the microgrooves (Fig. 3C) make the detection of neuritic inclusions obvious in C2. These control experiments showed that hAD seeding results in true propagation because there is no axonal overlap between neurons in C1 and C3.Figure 4Demonstration that propagation of endogenously aggregated rodent Tau is a real effect and not a device artifact in three-chamber microfluidic devices. A, RCNs were plated on DIV 0 in compartments C1, C2, and C3 of a three-compartment microfluidic device with the volume gradient increasing from C1 to C3 and the neurons of C1 were seeded with 18 nm of hAD seed on DIV 7. B, the cells were fixed 2 weeks later following the timelines of the two-compartment microfluidic devices and stained for rodent specific Tau, T49. T49-positive inclusions were detected in C3. C, when no RCNs were plated in C2, there were no T49-positive inclusions detected in compartment C3, suggesting that there was no axonal growth overlap between the two neuronal populations.

To demonstrate the robustness of our microfluidic assay, we developed a novel high-content imaging pipeline to quantify the propagation of hAD-seeded rodent Tau inclusions in our microfluidic devices. Fig. 5 summarizes the main steps of the Harmony software analysis pipeline used to quantify the neuritic thread-like inclusions when RCNs in two-compartment microfluidic devices were seeded with the hAD seed. By processing the raw images for their fluorescent background and using machine learning to identify the T49-positive neuritic thread-like regions (Tau-positive zones), we quantified the number of T49-positive neuritic thread-like inclusions (Fig. 5). To quantify and separate our results between the two microfluidic compartments, (i.e. seeded and propagation compartments), we developed a Java computer program named the Cell Counter. Fig. 6 summarizes the main steps followed when using the Cell Counter. This computer program enabled us to automate and quantify Tau pathology in a neuronal microfluidic model.Figure 6A computer program for the visualization and processing of the T49 neuritic-like thread inclusions in the seeded (top channel) and propagation (bottom channel) side of two-compartment microfluidic devices.

The standard conditions were SD = 7, FD = 21, and this along with SD/FD combinations 3/18, 3/24, 10/18, and 10/24 were tested on five 6-well plates containing microfluidic devices. Each plate had unseeded wells to assess the assay background conditions. The experiment was analyzed by mixed models analysis of variance. The results showed background levels did vary substantially across plates (>60% of total variation) and between seeding and propagation sides, indicating on-plate controls for background levels are required for this technology, and estimates of background levels should be subtracted from all seeded wells.

To investigate the antibacterial activity of Cinnamomum cassia L. essential oil (CCeo) alone and in combination with antibiotics against carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains was determined by Vitek® 2 and confirmed by MALDI-TOF/TOF. The antibacterial activity of CCeo and its synergism with antibiotics was determined using agar disk diffusion, broth microdilution, time-kill, and checkboard methods. The integrity of the bacterial cell membrane in S. marcescens was monitored by protein leakage assay. CCeo exhibited inhibitory effects with MIC = 281.25 μg.mL-1. The association between CCeo and polymyxin B showed a decrease in terms of viable cell counts on survival curves over time after a 4 hour-treatment with a FIC index value of 0.006. Protein leakage was observed with increasing concentrations for CCeo and CCeo + polymyxin B treatments. CCeo showed antibacterial activity against the studied strains. When associated with polymyxin B, a synergistic effect was able to inhibit bacterial growth rapidly and consistently, making it a potential candidate for the development of an alternative treatment and drug delivery system for carbapenemase-producing strains."

We set out to explore prospective associations between internet use (hours online and specific internet experiences) and future mental health problems. Methods Participants were 1,431 respondents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a UK birth cohort, who completed a questionnaire on internet use (time online and ten different internet experiences) when they were aged 18 years. Outcomes included past year self-harm, assessed at 21 years and high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, assessed at 22 years. Associations were investigated using logistic regression models and analyses were conducted separately for males and females. Results Females reporting high levels of internet use (number of hours online) were found to be at increased risk of depression at follow-up (highest tertile vs lowest tertile OR = 1.41, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.20), whereas males with high levels of internet use were at increased risk for self-harm (highest tertile vs lowest tertile OR = 2.53, 95%CI 0.93 to 6.90). There was no evidence to suggest an association between hours spent online and anxiety. With regards to the specific internet experiences, associations were found for females but not for males. In fully adjusted models, being bullied online (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.86) and meeting someone face to face (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.41) were associated with an increased risk of future depression. Being bullied online was also associated with an increased risk of future self-harm (OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.15), along with receiving unwanted sexual comments or material, and coming across pornography and violent/gruesome material. Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of digital citizenship training to help teach young people to use technology safely and responsibly."

Not all animals subjected to CSD, however, develop these impairments, and maintained social interaction in some animals is widely used as a model for resilience to stress-induced mental dysfunctions. So far, animals have mainly been studied shortly (24 hours and 7 days) after CSD exposure and longitudinal development of behavioral phenotypes in individual animals has been mostly neglected. We have analyzed social interaction and novel object recognition behavior of stressed mice at different time points after CSD and have found very dynamic courses of behavior of individual animals. Instead of the two groups, resilient or susceptible, that are found at early time points our data suggest four groups with (i, ii) animals behaving resilient or susceptible at early and late time points, respectively (iii) animals that start susceptible and recover with time or (iv) animals that are resilient at early time points but develop vulnerability later on."
https://openalex.org/W3045084056,"HetR and PatS/PatX-derived peptides are the activator and diffusible inhibitor for cell differentiation and patterning in heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria. HetR regulates target genes via HetR-recognition sites. However, some genes (such as patS/patX) upregulated at the early stage of heterocyst differentiation possess DIF1 (or DIF+) motif (TCCGGA) promoters rather than HetR-recognition sites; hetR possesses both predicted regulatory elements. How HetR controls heterocyst-specific expression from DIF1 motif promoters remains to be answered. This study presents evidence that the expression from DIF1 motif promoters of hetR, patS and patX is more directly dependent on hetZ, a gene regulated by HetR via a HetR-recognition site. The HetR-binding site upstream of hetR is not required for the autoregulation of hetR. PatU3 (3' portion of PatU) that interacts with HetZ may modulate the expression of hetR, hetZ and patS. These findings contribute to understanding of the mutual regulation of hetR, hetZ-patU and patS/patX in a large group of multicellular cyanobacteria."

The emergence of novel functionalised nanoparticles is considered a promising avenue for the development of biofilm-specific antimicrobial technologies. However, there is a gap in the understanding of interactions between nanoparticles and the biofilm matrix. Particularly, questions are raised on how nanoparticle charge and surface groups play a role in aggregation when in contact with biofilm components. Herein we present the synthesis of four types of silica nanoparticles and undertake an analysis of their interactions with Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm matrix. The effect of the biofilm matrix components on the charge and aggregation of the nanoparticles was assessed. Additionally, the study focused on the role of matrix proteins, with the in-depth characterisation of the protein corona of each nanoparticle by Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry experiments. The protein corona composition is dependent on the nanoparticle type; non-functionalised nanoparticles show less protein selectivity, whereas carboxylate-functionalised nanoparticles prefer proteins with a higher isoelectric point. These outcomes provide insights into the field of biofilm-nanoparticle interactions that can be valuable for the design of new nano-based targeting systems in future anti-biofilm applications."

Recently deep learning–based methods were shown to have the ability to predict gene regulatory regions from genome sequences, promising to aid the interpretation of genomic sequence data. Here, we report an improvement of the prediction accuracy for gene regulatory regions by using the design of convolution layers that efficiently process genomic sequence information, and developed a software, DeepGMAP, to train and compare different deep learning–based models (https://github.com/koonimaru/DeepGMAP). First, we demonstrate that our convolution layers, termed forward- and reverse-sequence scan (FRSS) layers, integrate both forward and reverse strand information, and enhance the power to predict gene regulatory regions. Second, we assessed previous studies and identified problems associated with data structures that caused overfitting. Finally, we introduce visualization methods to examine what the program learned. Together, our FRSS layers improve the prediction accuracy for gene regulatory regions."

While BPD is associated with difficulty forming trust and maintaining cooperation in trust-based exchanges, design and analytical methodology best suited to reveal the temporal ebb and flow of trust have been underutilized. We used an economic game to examine the trajectories of trust as it forms, dissolves, and restores in response to trust violation and repair, and to explain how these vary as a function of borderline pathology. Young adults (N = 234) played a 15-round trust game in which partner trustworthiness was varied to create three phases: trust formation, trust violation, and trust restoration. Discontinuous growth modelling was employed to capture the trends in trust over time and their relationship with BPD trait count. BPD trait count was associated with an incongruous pattern of trust behaviour in the form of declining trust when interacting with a new and cooperative partner, and paradoxically, increasing trust following multiple instances of trust violation by that partner. BPD trait count was also associated with trust restoring at a faster rate than it was originally formed. By adopting a methodology that recognizes the dynamic nature of trust, this study illustrated at a micro level how relational disturbances may be produced and maintained in those with a moderate to high BPD trait count. Further investigation of the factors and processes that underlie these incongruous trust dynamics is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3043923922,"Secondary lymphedema (SL)is a frequent and devastating complication of modern oncological therapy and filarial infections. A lack of a reliable preclinical model to investigate the underlying mechanism of clinical stage progression has limited the development of new therapeutic strategies. Current first line treatment has shown to be merely symptomatic and relies on lifetime use of compression garments and decongestive physiotherapy. In this study, we present the development of a secondary lymphedema model in 35 rats using pre- and intraoperative fluorescence-guided mapping of the lymphatics and microsurgical induction. In contrast to the few models reported so far, we decided to avoid the use of radiation for lymphedema induction. It turned out, that the model is nearly free of complications and capable of generating a statistically significant limb volume increase by water displacement measurements, sustained for at least 48 days. A translational, accurate lymphatic dysfunction was visualized by a novel VIS-NIR X-ray ICG-Clearance-Capacity imaging technology. For the first-time SL stage progression was validated by characteristic histological alterations, such as subdermal mast cell infiltration, adipose tissue deposition, and fibrosis by increased skin collagen content. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analysis suggested that stage progression is related to the presence of a characteristic α SMA+/HSP-47+/vimentin+ fibroblast subpopulation phenotype. These findings demonstrate that the in-vivo model is a reliable and clinically relevant SL model for the development of further secondary lymphedema therapeutic strategies and the analysis of the veiled molecular mechanisms of lymphatic dysfunction."

One hundred and twenty-eight patients in a single hospital were enrolled. The enrolled patients were treated with WG-HIFU for primary localized prostate cancer. Salvage treatment include androgen deprivation therapy, secondary HIFU and salvage radiation therapy. Our primary outcomes were biochemical recurrence-free survival, salvage treatment-free survival, and metastasis-free survival. Secondary outcomes included urinary incontinence, de novo erectile dysfunction, acute epididymitis, bladder neck contracture, and urethral stricture. The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 85.7%, 82.7%, and 45.2% for D'Amico low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed high risk group is the only predictor of significant shorter biochemical recurrence free survival, salvage treatment free survival, and metastasis free survival. Of 38 patients receiving salvage treatment after biochemical recurrence, 29 (76.3%) became free from biochemical recurrence. Rates of the adverse events of urinary incontinence, acute epididymitis, bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture, and de novo erectile dysfunction were 2.3%, 10.9%, 20.3%, 65.6%, respectively. In conclusion, WG-HIFU is an effective treatment option for localised prostate cancer, especially in D'Amico low- and intermediate-risk cases. The success rate of salvage treatment with radiation therapy and secondary HIFU for biochemical recurrence was acceptable. Fewer adverse events were caused by HIFU, especially incontinence and erectile dysfunction, than by radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3044019108,"Introduction Eswatini achieved a 44% decrease in new HIV infections from 2014 to 2019 through substantial scale-up of testing and treatment. However, it still has one of the highest rates of HIV incidence in the world, with 14 infections per 1,000 adults 15–49 years estimated for 2017. The Government of Eswatini has called for an 85% reduction in new infections by 2023 over 2017 levels. To make further progress towards this target and to achieve maximum health gains, this study aims to model optimized investments of available HIV resources. Methods The Optima HIV model was applied to estimate the impact of efficiency strategies to accelerate prevention of HIV infections and HIV-related deaths. We estimated the number of infections and deaths that could be prevented by optimizing HIV investments. We optimize across HIV programs, then across service delivery modalities for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), HIV testing, and antiretroviral refill, as well as switching to a lower cost antiretroviral regimen. Findings Under an optimized budget, prioritising HIV testing for the general population followed by key preventative interventions may result in approximately 1,000 more new infections (2% more) being averted by 2023. More infections could be averted with further optimization between service delivery modalities across the HIV cascade. Scaling-up index and self-testing could lead to 100,000 more people getting tested for HIV (25% more tests) with the same budget. By prioritizing Fast-Track, community-based, and facility-based antiretroviral refill options, an estimated 30,000 more people could receive treatment, 17% more than baseline or US$5.5 million could be saved, 4% of the total budget. Finally, switching non-pregnant HIV-positive adults to a Dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy regimen and concentrating delivery of VMMC to existing fixed facilities over mobile clinics, US$4.5 million (7% of total budget) and US$6.6 million (10% of total budget) could be saved, respectively. Significance With a relatively short five-year timeframe, even under a substantially increased and optimized budget, Eswatini is unlikely to reach their ambitious national prevention target by 2023. However, by optimizing investment of the same budget towards highly cost-effective VMMC, testing, and treatment modalities, further reductions in HIV incidence and cost savings could be realized."

Sdc-1 expression has been reported on dendritic cells (DC) and T cells. The potential role of Sdc-1 in DC-T cell interaction has not been investigated yet. We postulate that Sdc-1 is involved in DC-T cell interaction and may influence graft survival in an allogeneic transplant model. Sdc-1 expression on bone marrow-derived DC and T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Unstimulated and LPS stimulated Sdc-1 deficient DC were evaluated in vitro for phenotype and stimulatory capacity in mixed lymphocyte reaction. Sdc-1 deficient T cells were evaluated for proliferative capacity and differentiation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction and a proliferation assay. Allograft survival was evaluated in a fully MHC mismatched heterotopic heart transplant model, with either Sdc-1 deficient donors or recipients. Sdc-1 was expressed on the cell surface of unstimulated and LPS matured DC. Sdc-1 deficiency had no effect on expression of co-stimulatory molecules, cytokine production or T cell stimulatory capacity as compared to WT DC. Sdc-1 expression was not detectable on WT T cells, although intracellular Sdc-1 expression could be demonstrated after ConA activation. Sdc-1 deficient T cells showed reduced proliferation upon DC or ConA stimulation and reduced IL-17 production upon ConA stimulation, compared to WT T cells. Sdc-1 deficiency of either allograft or recipient did not prolong allograft survival. In conclusion, Sdc-1 is expressed on the cell surface of DC, where its absence does not affect DC phenotype or T cell stimulatory capacity. Sdc-1 is intracellularly expressed in ConA activated T cells. Sdc-1 deficiency in T cells results in a reduced proliferative response in vitro, as induced by DC and ConA. Sdc-1 deficiency in donor or recipient does not affect allograft survival."

Such compounds have been examined primarily as inhibitors of amyloid β-protein (Aβ), whereas testing of inhibitors of other amyloidogenic proteins has lagged behind. An important issue with screening compound libraries is that although an inhibitor suitable for therapy must be both effective and nontoxic, typical screening focuses on efficacy, whereas safety typically is tested at a later stage using cells and/or animals. In addition, typical thioflavin T (ThT)-fluorescence-based screens use the final fluorescence value as a readout, potentially missing important kinetic information. Here, we examined potential inhibitors of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) using ThT-fluorescence including the different phases of fluorescence change and added a parallel screen of SOD1 activity as a potential proxy for compound toxicity. Some compounds previously reported to inhibit other amyloidogenic proteins also inhibited SOD1 aggregation at low micromolar concentrations, whereas others were ineffective. Analysis of the lag phase and exponential slope added important information that could help exclude false-positive or false-negative results. SOD1 was highly resistant to inhibition of its activity, and therefore, did not have the necessary sensitivity to serve as a proxy for examining potential toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3045090799,"Expanding access to family planning (FP) is a principal objective of global family planning efforts and has been a driving force of national family planning programs in recent years. Many country programs are working alongside with the international family planning community to expand access to modern contraceptives. However, there is a challenging need for measuring all aspects of access. Measuring access usually requires linking information from multiple sources (e.g., individual women and facilities). To assess the influence of access to family planning services on modern contraceptive use among women, we link four rounds of individual women and service delivery points survey data from PMA2020 in Kinshasa. Multilevel logistics regression on pooled data is performed to test the influence of facility-level access factors on individual-level contraceptive use. We add variables tailored from a conceptual framework to cover elements of access to family planning: administrative access, geographic or physical access, economic access or affordability, cognitive access, service quality, and psychological access. We find that the effect of community and facility-level access factors varies extensively but having fewer stocked-out facilities and more facilities with long-acting permanent methods (LAPM) increases the odds of using modern contraceptives among women in Kinshasa. Our study shows that reliable supply chain with a broad array of method mix will increase the odds of modern contraceptive use at community level among women in Kinshasa. Using to community-oriented practices and service delivery along with empowering women to make health-related decisions should become a priority of family planning programs and international stakeholders in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3044767199,"The dosage sprayed upon per unit area is an important index to measure the effects of pesticide application. Owing to the fact that parameters such as flight height, flight speed, and spray swath can change at any given time, it is impossible to ensure a consistent amount of pesticide application per unit area during the course of aerial variable spray. In order to ensure a consistent amount of pesticide application per unit area, a set of control models of aerial variable spray using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was proposed, and the corresponding control system was developed based on the technology of aerial variable spray. According to the change of flight parameters, this system was able to adjust the opening degree of solenoid valve through the control model of aerial variable spray. After that, the amount per unit time would change to ensure a consistent amount of pesticide application per unit area, which effectively avoided the phenomenon of uneven pesticide application and improved the accuracy. According to the actual demand for the area in need of pesticide application, the operator can manually control the amount of pesticide applied and change the dosage sprayed upon per unit area to achieve a better effect. Through field tests, it was verified that the system has high accuracy of variable control. The deviation range was between 0.11% and 9.79%, which met the demands of agricultural aviation pesticide application. Furthermore, the system had strong stability for working continuously for more than 6 h at 30°C to meet the environmental requirements of pesticide application via UAV. All the data related to the pesticide application were stored in this system, which provided a reference for the further study of the precision technology in pesticide application. The model proposed in this paper also provided a theoretical basis for the technology development of aerial variable spray."
https://openalex.org/W3045059195,"Influenza virus accounts for majority of respiratory virus infections in Cameroon. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza-like illnesses (ILI) are identified by a measured temperature of ≥38°C and cough, with onset within the past 10 days. Other symptoms could as well be observed however, none of these are specific to influenza alone. This study aimed to determine symptom based predictors of influenza virus infection in Cameroon. Individuals with ILI were recruited from 2009–2018 in sentinel sites of the influenza surveillance system in Cameroon according to the WHO case definition. Individual data collection forms accompanied each respiratory sample and contained clinical data. Samples were analyzed for influenza using the gold standard assay. Two statistical methods were compared to determine the most reliable clinical predictors of influenza virus activity in Cameroon: binomial logistic predictive model and random forest model. Analyses were performed in R version 3.5.2. A total of 11816 participants were recruited, of which, 24.0% were positive for influenza virus. Binomial logistic predictive model revealed that the presence of cough, rhinorrhoea, headache and myalgia are significant predictors of influenza positivity. The prediction model had a sensitivity of 75.6%, specificity of 46.6% and AUC of 66.7%. The random forest model categorized the reported symptoms according to their degree of importance in predicting influenza virus infection. Myalgia had a 2-fold higher value in predicting influenza virus infection compared to any other symptom followed by arthralgia, head ache, rhinorrhoea and sore throat. The model had a OOB error rate of 25.86%. Analysis showed that the random forest model had a better performance over the binomial regression model in predicting influenza infection. Rhinorrhoea, headache and myalgia were symptoms reported by both models as significant predictors of influenza infection in Cameroon. These symptoms could be used by clinicians in their decision to treat patients."
https://openalex.org/W3045451851,"Introduction Malnutrition is a public health problem in under-five children in several parts of the world even after decades of the implementation of management protocols. An estimated 17 million children under the age of five years are living with severe acute malnutrition and the majorities are found in Asia and Africa, including Ethiopia. Objective The main objective of this study was to determine the recovery rate and its predictors among under-five children who were admitted to St. Paul’s Hospital Millennium Medical College from 2012 to 2019. Methods An institution based retrospective cohort study was employed at St. Paul’s Hospital Millennium Medical College from May 20, 2019 to June 28, 2019. Data were collected by reviewing children’s’ medical records using a structured checklist. A total of 534 charts were selected using a simple random sampling method and 515 of them were used for the final analysis. Ep-info version 7 software was used for data entry and STATA Version 15 for analysis. The Kaplan Meier failure estimate with Log-rank test was used to determine the survival estimates. Bi-variable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model were fitted to identify predictors of mortality. Finally, variables with p-values less than 0.05 in the multivariable Cox regression were considered as independent predictors. The proportional hazards assumption was checked using the Schoenfeld residuals test and the final model fitness was checked using the Cox-Snail residual test. Result In this study, a total of 515 subjects were followed for 8672 child–days and 79% of the subjects recovered from SAM with the median time of 17 days. The incidence density rate of recovery was 46 per 1000 child-days. Tuberculosis (AHR(Adjusted Hazard Ratio) 0.44 & 95% CI: 0.32, 0.62), pale conjunctiva (AHR,0.67 & 95% CI: 0.52, 0.88), IV fluid infusion (AHR, 0.71 & 95 CI: 0.51, 0.98), feeding F100 (AHR, 1.63 & 95% CI:1.04,2.54), Vitamin A supplementation (AHR, 1.3 & 95% CI:1.07, 1.59) and bottle feeding (AHR, 0.79 & 95CI%: 0.64–0.98) were the independent predictors of time to recovery from SAM. Conclusion In conclusion, the recovery rate was relatively higher than the Sphere standard and the national SAM management protocol. Co-morbidities and the treatments given were the main determinants of recovery of children. Co-morbidities must be managed as early as possible and the treatments given during the SAM management process need to be given with precaution."
https://openalex.org/W3045056444,"The most effective method for harvesting forest fruit is the mechanical vibration harvesting method. During the forced vibration process, the fruit will be shed from the tree when the inertia of the fruit is greater than the fruit's pedicel retention force. In order to study the movement response characteristics of the Ginkgo biloba fruit in depth, for a small Ginkgo biloba fruit tree, the frequency curve of the fruit tree had been obtained in this paper, based on the pulse hammer excitation method, and four resonant frequencies and four trough point frequencies, in the frequency range of 10 Hz~25 Hz, were determined as the test excitation frequency. Through a comparison test between the simulated fruit and the Ginkgo biloba fruit, both the simulated fruit and the real Ginkgo biloba fruit demonstrated good response consistency, and the results had shown that the simulated fruit could be used to replace the Ginkgo biloba fruit. The acceleration response of the resonant frequency and the trough point frequency for two test points of the two primary branches had also been analyzed. It was found that the resonant frequency caused an obvious harmonic response. For the same frequency, the fruit at some points produced a very strong vibrational response, while at other points the fruit was almost stationary. Therefore, it was difficult for a fruit tree to completely shed all its fruit through excitation at a single frequency. It was more difficult to induce a strong vibrational response of fruit on branches of higher stiffness. On the contrary, it was easier to induce a strong vibrational response on more flexible branches regardless of the resonant frequency or the trough point frequency excitation."
https://openalex.org/W3045259125,"Post-colonoscopy bleeding (PCB) is an important colonoscopy quality indicator that is recommended to be routinely collected by colorectal cancer screening programs and endoscopy quality improvement programs. We created a standardized and reliable definition of PCB and set of rules for attributing the relatedness of PCB to a colonoscopy.PCB events were identified from colonoscopies performed at the Forzani & MacPhail Colon Cancer Screening Centre. Existing definitions and relatedness rules for PCB were reviewed by the authors and a draft definition and set of rules was created. The definition and rules were revised after initial testing was performed using a set of 15 bleeding events. Information available for each event included the original endoscopy report and data abstracted from the emergency or inpatient record by a trained research assistant. A validation set of 32 bleeding events were then reviewed to assess their interrater reliability by having three endoscopists and one research assistant complete independent reviews and three endoscopists complete a consensus review. The Kappa statistic was used to measure interrater reliability.The panel classified 28 of 32 events as meeting the definition of PCB and rated 7, 8 and 6 events as definitely, probably and possibly related to the colonoscopy, respectively. The Kappa for the definition of PCB for the three independent reviews was 0.82 (substantial agreement). The Kappa for the attribution of the PCB to the colonoscopy by the three endosocopists was 0.74 (substantial agreement). The research assistant had a high agreement with the panel for both the definition (100% agreement) and application of the causal criteria (kappa 0.95).A standardized definition of PCB and attribution rules achieved high interrater reliability by endoscopists and a non-endoscopist and provides a template of required data for event adjudication by screening and quality improvement programs."
https://openalex.org/W3045332485,"Genome-wide association studies of gastric cancer (GC) cases have revealed common gastric cancer susceptibility loci with low effect size. We investigated rare variants with high effect size via whole-exome sequencing (WES) of subjects with familial clustering of gastric cancer. WES of DNAs from the blood of 19 gastric cancer patients and 36 unaffected family members from 14 families with two or more gastric cancer patients were tested. Linkage analysis combined with association tests were performed using Pedigree Variant Annotation, Analysis, and Search Tool (pVAAST) software. Based on the logarithm of odds (LOD) and permutation-based composite likelihood ratio test (CLRT) from pVAAST, MUC4 was identified as a predisposing gene (LOD P-value = 1.9×10-5; permutation-based P-value of CLRT ≤ 9.9×10-9). In a larger cohort consisting of 597 GC patients and 9,759 healthy controls genotyped with SNP array, we discovered common variants in MUC4 regions (rs148735556, rs11717039, and rs547775645) significantly associated with GC supporting the association of MUC4 with gastric cancer. And the MUC4 variants were found in higher frequency in The Cancer Genome Atlas Study (TCGA) germline samples of patients with multiple cancer types. Immunohistochemistry indicated that MUC4 was downregulated in the noncancerous gastric mucosa of subjects with MUC4 germline missense variants, suggesting that loss of the protective function of MUC4 predisposes an individual to gastric cancer. Rare variants in MUC4 can be novel gastric cancer susceptibility loci in Koreans possessing the familial clustering of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3045487535,"In today's Western societies a high percentage of people experience increased or chronic stress. Acupuncture could serve as treatment for persons affected adversely by the increased stress.The AkuRest study was a two-centre randomized controlled pilot study in adult persons with increased stress levels. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: verum acupuncture treatment, sham acupuncture, and a waiting control group. The feasibility of the study was assessed. In addition, effects on stress level (measured by the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ-20)) and other variables were assessed at the end of treatment and a 3-month follow-up.Altogether, N = 70 persons were included in the study. At the end of the treatment 15.7% were lost to follow-up. The adherence to the protocol was good: 82.9% of the participants completed 100% of their treatment. The stress level of the participants was high at baseline (mean PSQ-20 score 75.5, SD = 8.2). Effect sizes (ES) at T1 showed that verum and sham acupuncture were superior to the waiting condition in reducing stress (ES (verum) = -1.39, 95%-CI = [-2.11; -0.67]: ES (sham) = -1.12, CI = [-1.78;-0.44]). At follow-up, effect sizes were in favour of the verum group (as compared to sham). However, confidence intervals and t-tests showed that these differences were not significant.The pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of the acupuncture RCT in persons with increased stress levels. Estimated parameters can be used to design a larger RCT to prove the-here indicated-efficacy of verum acupuncture to decrease stress.ISRCTN15259166."
https://openalex.org/W3044061655,"PCR-based amplification of annotated genes has allowed construction of expression clones at genome-scale using classical and recombination-based cloning technologies. However, genome-scale expression and purification of proteins for down-stream applications is often limited by challenges such as poor expression, low solubility, large size of multi-domain proteins, etc. Alternatively, DNA fragment libraries in expression vectors can serve as the source of protein fragments with each fragment encompassing a function of its whole protein counterpart. However, the random DNA fragmentation and cloning result in only 1 out of 18 clones being in the correct open-reading frame (ORF), thus, reducing the overall efficiency of the system. This necessitates the selection of correct ORF before expressing the protein fragments. This paper describes a highly efficient ORF selection system for DNA fragment libraries, which is based on split beta-lactamase protein fragment complementation. The system has been designed to allow seamless transfer of selected DNA fragment libraries into any downstream vector systems using a restriction enzyme-free cloning strategy. The strategy has been applied for the selection of ORF using model constructs to show near 100% selection of the clone encoding correct ORF. The system has been further validated by construction of an ORF-selected DNA fragment library of 30 genes of M. tuberculosis. Further, we have successfully demonstrated the cytosolic expression of ORF-selected protein fragments in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W3044697205,"The number of reproductive partners per individual varies markedly across animal mating systems. This variation may be an important determinant of patterns of immunogenetic diversity, particularly at Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I and II loci. To compare immunogenetic variation in taxa with markedly different mating systems, we used RNAseq-generated data to quantify genotypic diversity in three species of Peromyscine rodents: the monogamous California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) and the polygynandrous deer mouse (P. maniculatus) and brush mouse (P. boylii). By sampling populations of these species from multiple localities in California, we were able to conduct replicated analyses of the relationship between mating system and immunogenetic variation. Across the four localities sampled, diversity at MHC Class I and II genes was consistently higher in the two polygynandrous species. We found no evidence that sampling location (i.e., variation in habitat conditions) contributed to observed differences in MHC variation among populations or species. Collectively, our data indicate that immunogenetic variation in Peromyscine mice is associated with reproductive behavior, rather than geographic locality or habitat type. The consistently greater variability detected in the polygynandrous species examined suggests that balancing selection imposed by behaviorally-mediated pathogen exposure is important in maintaining variation at MHC genes in these animals."
https://openalex.org/W3045464598,"Small conductance, calcium-activated (SK3) potassium channels control the intrinsic excitability of dopaminergic neurons (DN) in the midbrain and modulate their susceptibility to toxic insults during development.We evaluated the age-dependency of the neuroprotective effect of an SK3 agonist, 1-Ethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one (1-EBIO), on Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) excitotoxicity to DN in ventral mesencephalon (VM) organotypic cultures.Most tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ neurons were also SK3+; SK3+/TH- cells (DN+) were common at each developmental stage but more prominently at day in vitro (DIV) 8. Young DN+ neurons were small bipolar and fusiform, whereas mature ones were large and multipolar. Exposure of organotypic cultures to AMPA (100 μm, 16 h) had no effect on the survival of DN+ at DIV 8, but caused significant toxicity at DIV 15 (n = 15, p = 0.005) and DIV 22 (n = 15, p<0.001). These results indicate that susceptibility of DN to AMPA excitotoxicity is developmental stage-dependent in embryonic VM organotypic cultures. Immature DN+ (small, bipolar) were increased after AMPA (100 μm, 16 h) at DIV 8, at the expense of the number of differentiated (large, multipolar) DN+ (p = 0.039). This effect was larger at DIV 15 (p<<<0.0001) and at DIV 22 (p<<<0.0001). At DIV 8, 30 μM 1-EBIO resulted in a large increase in DN+. At DIV 15, AMPA toxicity was prevented by exposure to 30 μM, but not 100 μM 1-EBIO. At DIV 22, excitotoxicity was unaffected by 30 μM 1-EBIO, and partially reduced by 100 μM 1-EBIO.The effects of the SK3 channel agonist 1-EBIO on the survival of SK3-expressing dopaminergic neurons were concentration-dependent and influenced by neuronal developmental stage."
