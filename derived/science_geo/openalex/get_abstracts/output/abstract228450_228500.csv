https://openalex.org/W2036694628,"The addition of small ‘seed’ particles to a supersaturated solution can greatly increase the rate at which crystals nucleate. This process is understood, at least qualitatively, when the seed has the same structure as the crystal that it spawns1,2. However, the microscopic mechanism of seeding by a ‘foreign’ substance is not well understood. Here we report numerical simulations of colloidal crystallization seeded by foreign objects. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to study how smooth spherical seeds of various sizes affect crystallization in a suspension of hard colloidal particles. We compute the free-energy barrier associated with crystal nucleation3,4. A low barrier implies that nucleation is easy. We find that to be effective crystallization promoters, the seed particles need to exceed a well-defined minimum size. Just above this size, seed particles act as crystallization ‘catalysts’ as newly formed crystallites detach from the seed. In contrast, larger seed particles remain covered by the crystallites that they spawn. This phenomenon should be experimentally observable and can have important consequences for the control of the resulting crystal size distribution."

But writing methods such as dip-pen nanolithography and ink-jet printing are either confined to two dimensions or beset by wetting and spreading problems. Here we use concentrated polyelectrolyte inks to write three-dimensional microperiodic structures directly without using masks. Our technique enables us to write arbitrary three-dimensional patterns whose features are nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than those attained with other multilayer printing techniques."

https://openalex.org/W2087022246,"The rate of twentieth-century global sea level rise and its causes are the subjects of intense controversy. Most direct estimates from tide gauges give 1.5-2.0 mm yr(-1), whereas indirect estimates based on the two processes responsible for global sea level rise, namely mass and volume change, fall far below this range. Estimates of the volume increase due to ocean warming give a rate of about 0.5 mm yr(-1) (ref. 8) and the rate due to mass increase, primarily from the melting of continental ice, is thought to be even smaller. Therefore, either the tide gauge estimates are too high, as has been suggested recently, or one (or both) of the mass and volume estimates is too low. Here we present an analysis of sea level measurements at tide gauges combined with observations of temperature and salinity in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans close to the gauges. We find that gauge-determined rates of sea level rise, which encompass both mass and volume changes, are two to three times higher than the rates due to volume change derived from temperature and salinity data. Our analysis supports earlier studies that put the twentieth-century rate in the 1.5-2.0 mm yr(-1) range, but more importantly it suggests that mass increase plays a larger role than ocean warming in twentieth-century global sea level rise."

Nuclear receptors form a superfamily of phylogenetically related proteins and control functions associated with major diseases (e.g. diabetes, osteoporosis, and cancer). In this study, a novel method has been developed for classifying the subfamilies of nuclear receptors. The classification was achieved on the basis of amino acid and dipeptide composition from a sequence of receptors using support vector machines. The training and testing was done on a non-redundant data set of 282 proteins obtained from the NucleaRDB data base (1Horn F. Vriend G. Cohen F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The performance of all classifiers was evaluated using a 5-fold cross validation test. In the 5-fold cross-validation, the data set was randomly partitioned into five equal sets and evaluated five times on each distinct set while keeping the remaining four sets for training. It was found that different subfamilies of nuclear receptors were quite closely correlated in terms of amino acid composition as well as dipeptide composition. The overall accuracy of amino acid composition-based and dipeptide compositionbased classifiers were 82.6 and 97.5%, respectively. Therefore, our results prove that different subfamilies of nuclear receptors are predictable with considerable accuracy using amino acid or dipeptide composition. Furthermore, based on above approach, an online web service, NRpred, was developed, which is available at www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nrpred.

Furthermore, based on above approach, an online web service, NRpred, was developed, which is available at www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nrpred. The availability of sequence data for different genomes in recent years has increased the demand for computational tools that can recognize new proteins from this data. The recognition of nuclear receptors is crucial, because many of them are potential drug targets for developing therapeutic strategies for diseases like breast cancer and diabetes (2Robinson-Rechavi M. Laude V. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 95-118PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors are one of the most abundant classes of transcriptional regulators, which regulate diverse functions during reproduction, metabolism, and development. Nuclear receptors function as ligand-activated transcriptional factors, providing a direct link between the signaling molecules that control these processes and transcriptional responses (3Robinson-Rechavi M. Escriva Garcia H. Laudet V. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 585-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The nuclear receptors share a common structural organization. All nuclear receptors consist of six distinct regions or domains as follows: highly variable N-terminal and C-terminal regions (A/B and F domains) that contain one or more transactivation regions; a central, well conserved DNA binding domain (C); a non-conserved hinge region (D) that contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and a moderately conserved ligand binding domain (E) (4Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. The Nuclear Receptors FactsBook. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain (C region) of nuclear receptors consists of two zinc fingers, which act as a signature for this superfamily (5Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The presence of these zinc fingers facilitates the recognition of nuclear receptors from a genome sequence using simple similarity-based search tools like BLAST and FASTA (6Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar, 7Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the major limitation of these search tools is that they are not able to recognize the subfamilies of nuclear receptors. The nuclear receptors have been classified and assigned seven subfamilies according to the NucleaRDB database, which include thyroid and estrogen hormone-like receptors (1Horn F. Vriend G. Cohen F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, classification of these subfamilies by using phylogeny-based or BLAST-based tools is difficult due to a scarcity of data for some subfamilies. Thus, there is a crucial need for methods that will enable the automated assignment of nuclear receptor subfamilies. In this report, we have made an attempt to develop a method for recognizing the subfamilies of nuclear receptors. We were able to design a method for recognizing the four subfamilies of nuclear receptors: (i) thyroid hormone-like (TR, RAR, and ROR); (ii) HNF4-like (HNF4, RXR, TLL, Coup, and USP); (iii) estrogen-like (ER, ERR, GR, MR, PR, and AR); and (iv) Fushi tarazu-F1-like (SFI, FTF, and FTZ-F1). Sequences for the other three subfamilies are not available in significant number (<10). The classification and assignment of nuclear receptors to various subfamilies was done on the basis of amino acid composition and dipeptide composition. Amino acid and dipeptide compositions are simplistic approaches for producing patterns of fixed length from the protein sequences of varying length (8Shepherd A.J. Gorse D. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 2003; 50: 290-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the past, amino acid composition has been used to predict the structural class of domains and the subcellular localization of proteins (9Hua S. Sun Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 10Chou K.C. Cai Y.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45765-45769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 11Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). The dipeptide composition is also widely used to encapsulate the global information and give a fixed pattern length of 400. In the past, dipeptide composition has been used for predicting the subcellular localization of proteins (11Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) and for fold recognition (12Grassmann J. Reczko M. Suhai S. Edler L. Lengauer T. Schneider R. Bork P. Brutlag D.L. Glasgow J.I. Mewes H.-W. Zimmer R. Proceeding of the Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, Heidelberg, Germany, August 6-10, 1999. American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Menlo Park, CA1999: 106-112Google Scholar, 13Reczko M. Bohr H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 22: 3616-3619Google Scholar). In this study, support vector machines (SVMs) 1The abbreviations used are: SVM, support vector machine; MCC, Matthew's correlation coefficient; RI, reliability index. were applied to classify nuclear receptors. SVMs are a relatively new type of statistical learning method that have proven to be particularly attractive for biological analysis due to their ability to handle large data sets and avoid overfitting. SVMs have been shown to perform well in multiple areas of biological analysis, including classification of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (14Karchin R. Karplus K. Haussler D. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and enzyme families (15Cai C.Z. Han L.Y. Ji Z.L. Chen Y.Z. Proteins. 2004; 55: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), analysis of protein functions and types (16Cai Y.D. Ricardo P.W. Jen C.H. Chou K.C. J. Theor. Biol. 2004; 226: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Cai C.Z. Wang W.L. Sun L.Z. Chen Y.Z. Math. Biosci. 2003; 185: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and prediction of RNA-binding proteins (18Han L.Y. Cai C.Z. Lo S.L. Chung M.C. Chen Y.Z. RNA. 2004; 10: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The overall accuracy of amino acid and dipeptide composition-based classifiers are 82.6 and 97.5% respectively. The Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of the dipeptide composition-based classifier is 0.96, which is significantly higher in comparison to that of the amino acid composition-based classifier. MCC is a better parameter for evaluating the performance of a method, as it accounts for both over- and under-predictions. The performance of both classifiers has been estimated through a 5-fold cross-validation test. It was found that various subfamilies of nuclear receptors are correlated with amino acid or dipeptide composition, implying that the subfamilies of nuclear receptors are predictable to a highly accurate extent if good training data can be established. The method is available via the World Wide Web at www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nrpred. Data Set—The data for four subfamilies of nuclear receptors was obtained from the NucleaRDB data base available at www.receptors.org/NR/ (1Horn F. Vriend G. Cohen F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All entries not marked as fragments were extracted from the data base by the text-parsing method. The initial data set had 577 sequences belonging to four subfamilies of nuclear receptors. Redundancy was reduced so that no sequence had ≥90% sequence identity with any other sequence in the data set, using PROSET software (19Brendel V. Math. Comput. Model. 1992; 16: 37-43Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The final data set contains 282 sequences belonging to different subfamilies of nuclear receptors as shown in Table I.Table IThe number of sequences belonging to each nuclear receptor subfamilyNuclear receptor subfamiliesNo. of protein sequencesThyroid hormone-like114HNF-4-like72Estrogen-like75Fusi-tarazu-like21 Open table in a new tab Design and Implementation of the Prediction System—The prediction of subfamilies of nuclear receptors is a multi-class classification problem. In this case, the number of subfamilies of nuclear receptors was four. To handle this multi-class situation, we designed a series of binary SVMs. For N class classification, N SVMs were constructed. The ith SVM was trained with all samples of the ith subfamily being labeled as positive, and the samples of all other subfamilies being labeled as negative. The SVMs trained in this way were referred to as 1-v-r SVMs (9Hua S. Sun Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). In this classification approach, each of the unknown proteins will achieve four scores. An unknown protein will be classified into the subfamily that corresponds to the 1-v-r SVM with the highest output score. Support Vector Machine—The SVMs were implemented using freely downloadable software, SVM_light, written by T. Joachims (20Joachims T. Schölkopf B. Burges C.J.C. Smola A.J. Advances in Kernel Methods-Support Vector Learning. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1999: 169-184Google Scholar). This software enables the users to define a number of parameters as well as the choice of inbuilt kernel, such as a radial basis function (RBF) or a polynomial kernel (of given degree). In this study, all of the parameters of a kernel were kept constant, except for the regulatory parameter C. The experimentation was conducted by using various types of kernels such as polynomial and radial base function. The SVMs require a fixed number of inputs for training, thus necessitating a strategy for encapsulating the global information about proteins of variable length in a fixed length format. The fixed length format was obtained from protein sequences of variable length using amino acid and dipeptide composition. Amino Acid Composition—Protein information can be encapsulated in a vector of 20 dimensions, using amino acid composition of the protein. In the past, this approach has been used for predicting the subcellular localization of proteins (9Hua S. Sun Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 21Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition is the fraction of each amino acid type within a protein. The fractions of all 20 natural amino acids were calculated by using Equation 1,Fraction of aai=total number of amino acids of type itotal number of amino acids in protein(Eq. 1) where i is an specific type of amino acid (aa). Dipeptide Composition—The dipeptide composition was used to transform the variable length of proteins to fixed length feature vectors. Dipeptide composition has been used earlier by Grassmann et al. (12Grassmann J. Reczko M. Suhai S. Edler L. Lengauer T. Schneider R. Bork P. Brutlag D.L. Glasgow J.I. Mewes H.-W. Zimmer R. Proceeding of the Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, Heidelberg, Germany, August 6-10, 1999. American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Menlo Park, CA1999: 106-112Google Scholar) and Reczko and Bohr (13Reczko M. Bohr H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 22: 3616-3619Google Scholar) for the development of fold recognition methods (12Grassmann J. Reczko M. Suhai S. Edler L. Lengauer T. Schneider R. Bork P. Brutlag D.L. Glasgow J.I. Mewes H.-W. Zimmer R. Proceeding of the Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, Heidelberg, Germany, August 6-10, 1999. American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Menlo Park, CA1999: 106-112Google Scholar, 13Reczko M. Bohr H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 22: 3616-3619Google Scholar). We adopted the same dipeptide composition-based approach in developing an SVM-based method for predicting subcellular localization of eukaryotic proteins (11Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). The dipeptide composition gave a fixed pattern length of 400. Dipeptide composition encapsulates information about the fraction of amino acids as well as their local order. It was calculated using Equation 2,Fraction of dep(i)=total number of dep(i)total number of all possible dipeptides(Eq. 2) where dep(i) is one dipeptide i of 400 dipeptides. Evaluation of Performance—The performance all classifiers was evaluated through 5-fold cross validation. In 5-fold cross validation, the data set was partitioned randomly to five equally sized sets. The training and testing of each classifier was carried out five times using one distinct set for testing and the other four sets for training. The performance of classifiers was evaluated by measuring accuracy and the MCC for each subfamily of nuclear receptors, as described by Hua and Sun (9Hua S. Sun Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) and shown below in Equations 3 and 4,Accuracy(x)=p(x)exp(x)(Eq. 3) MCC(x)=p(x)n(x)−u(x)o(x)(p(x)+u(x))(p(x)+o(x))(n(x)+u(x))(n(x)+o(x))(Eq. 4) where x can be any subfamily of nuclear receptors, exp(x) the number of sequences observed in subfamily x, p(x) the number of correctly predicted sequences of subfamily x, n(x) the number of correctly predicted sequences not of subfamily x, u(x) the number of under-predicted sequences, and o(x) the number of over-predicted sequences. Reliability Index (RI)—The determination of prediction reliability is important when using machine learning techniques to assign subfamilies of nuclear receptors. The reliability index (RI) was assigned on the basis of difference (Δ) between highest and second highest value of SVMs in multi-class classification (22Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar, 23Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). RI provides an insight into the accuracy/reliability of prediction. Equation 5, shown below,RI={INT (Δ∗5/3)+1if 0≤Δ<45if Δ≥4(Eq. 5) demonstrates how the RI was defined for each sequence. Artificial intelligence-based techniques such as SVM and the neural network are elegant approaches for the extraction of complex patterns from biological sequence data. These techniques are highly successful for residue state prediction, where fixed window/pattern length is used (24Krogh A. Riis S.K. Touretzky D.S. Mozer M.C. Hasaselmo M.E. Advances in Neural Information Processing System 8. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1996: 917-923Google Scholar). The major limitation of artificial intelligence techniques is that they need pattern/input units of fixed length. In this study, amino acid composition and dipeptide composition were used to transform the variable lengths of proteins to fixed length patterns. The classifiers were developed using the support vector machines, because it was shown in the past that SVM is better at classifying the biological data in comparison with the artificial neural network (25Ward J.J. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1650-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 26Bhasin M. Raghava G.P. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The results of 5-fold cross validation of amino acid composition-based and dipeptide composition-based classification are summarized in Table II. The accuracy of the five different sets used in the evaluation of the classifier during 5-fold cross-validation are shown in Table S1 of the supplementary material (at www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nrpred/help.html#bottom and in the on-line version of this article). The information about the number of true positive (P), true negative (N), false positive (O), and false negative (U) sequences predicted in each set used during 5-fold cross-validation are illustrated in Table S2 of the supplementary material. Table II illustrates that the best results achieved kernel parameters. The overall accuracy and MCC of the amino acid composition-based classifier for classifying the four subfamilies of nuclear receptors was 82.6% and 0.74, respectively. It proved that subfamilies of nuclear receptors correlated with amino acid composition and can be easily distinguished on this basis.Table IIThe prediction accuracy (ACC) and MCC of both amino acid and dipeptide composition-based classifiers with the radial basis function (RBF) type of kernel functionNuclear receptorsAmino acid composition RBF kernel (γ = 500; C = 5)aResults were obtained through 5-fold cross-validationDipeptide composition RBF kernel (γ = 3)aResults were obtained through 5-fold cross-validationACCMCCACCMCC%%Thyroid hormone-like (TR, RAR, ROR)87.70.751000.98HNF4-like (HNF4, RXR, TLL, COUP, USP)68.00.6295.80.96Estrogen-like (ER, ERR, GR, MR, PR, AR)89.30.8398.70.96Fushi tarazu-F1-like (SF1, FTF, FTZ-F1)80.90.8985.30.92Overall82.60.7497.50.96a Results were obtained through 5-fold cross-validation Open table in a new tab Recently, Chou and Cai demonstrated that the order of sequence along with amino acid composition (pseudo-amino acid composition) improved the accuracy of the classification of proteins (27Chou K.C. Cai Y.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 1250-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Chou K.C. Protiens. 2001; 43: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also used pseudo-amino acid composition to classify nuclear receptors with better accuracy and reconfirm the role of sequence order on classification accuracy. First, pseudo-amino acid composition was generated using amino acid composition with “sequence-order-correlated” factors. The different pseudo-amino acid compositions were generated using sequence-order-correlated factors of different orders (1st to 35th rank), as described by Chou and Cai (27Chou K.C. Cai Y.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 1250-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The overall performance of the classifiers generated by using pseudo-amino acid in classifying the four subfamilies of nuclear receptors is shown in Table III. The results depicted show that the overall MCC (0.86) and accuracy (90.7%) of the pseudoamino acid based approach is better in comparison with that of the conventional amino acid composition-based approach. The results also demonstrate that accuracy as well as MCC increases up to the 30th rank (pseudo-amino acid composition generated by merging sequence-order-correlated factors from the 1st to the 30th rank with amino acid composition) and becomes nearly constant afterward. Thus, a remarkable improvement in predicting the subfamilies of nuclear receptors was achieved using pseudo-amino acid composition.Table IIIThe performance of different pseudo-amino acid composition-based approaches in classifying the subfamilies of the nuclear receptors The pseudo-amino acid composition was derived as described by Chou and Cai (27Chou K.C. Cai Y.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 1250-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The rank specifies the sequence order-coupling mode along the sequence. For example, the 1st rank reflects the coupling mode between most contiguous residues, and the 5th ranks specify the coupling mode between all of the 5th most contiguous residues. The rank “up to 5th” means it was developed using pseudo-amino acid composition generated by merging five sequence-order-correlated factors with amino acid composition (amino acid composition + (1st + 2nd + 3rd + 4th + 5th) sequence order factors.

The performance of pseudoamino acid composition generated using the amino acid composition and hydrophobicity correlation factor is demonstrated in Table III. The performance of the classifier based on this approach was slightly lower than that seen with the amino composition-based approach. Finally, a pseudo-amino acid composition was generated using sequence-order factor and hydrophobicity-correlated factor with amino acid composition. The performance of classifier based on this approach up to the 30th rank is shown in Table III. The 30th rank reflects the coupling mode between all of the 30th most contiguous residues. The performance shown in Table III was obtained using 5-fold cross-validation. The best results (accuracy = 87.2 and MCC = 0.81) obtained using this approach were significantly better in comparison with those obtained with the amino acid composition-based approach. These results proved that pseudo-amino acid composition could provide more information about a protein sequence, resulting in the improvement of prediction accuracy. On the other hand, the performance of the dipeptide composition-based approach was better as compared with that of the pseudo-amino acid composition-based approach. The most likely reason for the lesser performance of the pseudo-amino acid composition-based approach may be that it considers only identical pairs of amino acids and ignores non-identical pairs. The dipeptide composition based approach considers all of the contiguous pairs of amino acids whether they are identical or non-identical. To further improve prediction accuracy, a classifier based on the conventional dipeptide composition of protein was developed. The dipeptide encapsulates the global information of the amino acid fraction and the local order of amino acids. Thus, dipeptide composition is a better feature as compared with amino acid composition alone. The overall accuracy and MCC of a dipeptide composition-based classifier were 97.6% and 0.97, respectively, which were significantly higher in comparison with the accuracy and MCC of the amino acid compositionbased classifier. The detailed performance of the classifier on each set that was used for evaluation during 5-fold cross-validation is shown in Tables S1 and S2 of the supplementary material (www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nrpred/help.html#bottom and in the on-line version of this article). The overall accuracy of the dipeptide composition-based classifier was nearly 15% greater than that of the amino acid composition-based classifier. The overall MCC of the dipeptide composition-based classifier was 0.97, which was significantly higher than the MCC of the amino acid composition-based classifier. The detailed accuracy and MCC of dipeptide composition based classifiers in recognizing different subfamilies of nuclear receptors are shown in Table II. The results demonstrate that the thyroid hormone-like receptor subfamily is classified more accurately (accuracy = 100% and MCC = 0.98) in comparison with other subfamilies. The most likely reason for such results may be due to the large size of the data set related to thyroid hormone-like receptors. It is expected that the success rate for the other subfamilies can be further enhanced by improving the training data by adding more new proteins belonging to the subfamilies defined here. These results also illustrated that the dipeptide compositionbased classifier is able to recognize the subfamilies of nuclear receptors more accurately as compared with amino acid composition-based classifier alone. This suggests that different subfamilies of nuclear receptors are correlated dipeptide composition considerably. Reliability Index—To bring further confidence to the user about the reliability of the prediction, the reliability index of both amino acid composition-based prediction and dipeptide composition-based prediction was also calculated. The RI assignment provides information about the certainty of prediction for a particular sequence. The reliability index was assigned according to the difference between the highest and the second highest 1-v-r SVM output score (9Hua S. Sun Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 11Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). If a sample was predicted to have a large positive score for a class of nuclear receptors (away from the average score), the sample had a greater probability of belonging to that class. The reliability index is the key tool for considering receptors with high prediction accuracy (30Hua S. Sun Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The curves shown in Fig. 1 answer the question of how reliable is the prediction for sequences labeled with a particular reliability index. For example, in the case of amino acid composition-based classifiers, the expected accuracy of sequences with RI = 5 is 100%, with 32.2% of the sequences of the whole data set having RI = 5. The expected accuracy at different RI values is shown by plotting a curve between the expected accuracy and the RI (Fig. 1A). A similar curve is also plotted for dipeptide composition-based classifiers (Fig. 1B). The dipeptide composition-based classifier predicted 84.2% sequences with RI > = 3. These sequences (RI > = 3) are nearly 100% correctly predicted. These results suggest that our method is able to predict the subfamilies of nuclear receptors with high accuracy. Thus, this classifier will complement the existing similarity search-based methods like BLAST and FASTA in recognizing the nuclear receptor proteins with high accuracy. Conclusion—We have developed the NRpred server for recognizing the subfamilies of nuclear receptors proteins. This method, in association with a similarity search tool, can be used for automated annotation of genomic data. The study also proves that there is a direct correlation between the features of the proteins (amino acid and dipeptide composition) and the subfamilies of nuclear receptors. The establishment of such methods will speed up the pace of identifying subfamilies of nuclear receptors and, thus, will facilitate drug discovery for inflammatory diseases or osteoporosis. Description of Server—NRpred runs as a CGI server, written in PERL and operating under Solaris 420R. The interface of the server is straightforward and intuitive. The server accepts the protein sequence in any standard format like EMBL, GCG, FASTA, or in plain text format. The server uses the Readseq program to read the input sequence. The server provides the option of prediction either on the basis of amino acid composition or dipeptide composition. After analysis, the result will be displayed in a user-friendly format. The result provides information about the predicted subfamily of nuclear receptors, its reliability index, and the expected accuracy. The server and related information is available from www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nrpred. Any information from experimental biologists regarding the different subfamilies of nuclear receptors is most welcome. In the future, more information about different subfamilies of nuclear receptors will be collected to establish a high quality, large data set, because the performance of any knowledge-based method is dependent on the quality and quantity of data. This data set will be used to further update and increase the performance of method. The users are encouraged to give their feedback about any experimental conformation or falsification of the predictions.

Here we report the 2.6-Å crystal structure of a complex comprised of the extracellular domain of GpIbα and the wild-type A1 domain of VWF. A direct comparison of this structure to a GpIbα-A1 complex containing “gain-of-function” mutations, A1-R543Q and GpIbα-M239V, reveals specific structural differences between these complexes at sites near the two GpIbα-A1 binding interfaces. At the smaller interface, differences in interaction show that the α1-β2 loop of A1 serves as a conformational switch, alternating between an open α1-β2 isomer that allows faster dissociation of GpIbα-A1, as observed in the wild-type complex, and an extended isomer that favors tight association as seen in the complex containing A1 with a type 2B von Willebrand Disease (VWD) mutation associated with spontaneous binding to GpIbα. At the larger interface, differences in interaction associated with the GpIbα-M239V platelet-type VWD mutation are minor and localized but feature discrete γ-turn conformers at the loop end of the β-hairpin structure. The β-hairpin, stabilized by a strong classic γ-turn as seen in the mutant complex, relates to the increased affinity of A1 binding, and the β-hairpin with a weak inverse γ-turn observed in the wild-type complex corresponds to the lower affinity state of GpIbα. These findings provide important details that add to our understanding of how both type 2B and platelet-type VWD mutations affect GpIbα-A1 binding affinity.

These findings provide important details that add to our understanding of how both type 2B and platelet-type VWD mutations affect GpIbα-A1 binding affinity. The adhesion of blood platelets to sites of vascular injury is mediated by von Willebrand factor (VWF), 1The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; Gp, platelet glycoprotein receptor; VWD, von Willebrand disease.1The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; Gp, platelet glycoprotein receptor; VWD, von Willebrand disease. a large multimeric plasma glycoprotein that binds to both exposed connective tissue and platelet surface receptors (1Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 2Ruggeri Z.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). VWF is localized to the site of injury via attachment of its A3 domain to exposed collagen in the subendothelium (3Lankhof H. vanHoeij M. Shiphorst M.E. Bracke M. Wu Y.P. Ijsseldijk M.J. Vink T. deGroot P.G. Sixma J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Subsequently, platelets are recruited through a direct interaction between the multimeric glycoprotein receptor complex GpIb-IX-V on the platelet surface, and the A1 domain of immobilized VWF (4Berndt M.C. Shen Y. Dopheide S.M. Gardiner E.E. Andrews R.K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). GpIb-IX-V is comprised of four transmembrane subunits, GpIbα, GpIbβ, GpIX, and GpV, and the binding site for A1 is localized to the extracellular domain of GpIbα (5Andrews R.K. Lopez J.A. Berndt M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). There is no measurable binding of normal VWF to platelets in circulating blood, and the binding of VWF to GpIbα requires high shear conditions generated by rapidly flowing blood (6Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). At lower flow rates, platelet adhesion is independent of GpIbα and VWF and involves other adhesive interactions, including those between collagen and GpIa-IIa (integrin α2β1) (7Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkerman J.W. Houdijk W.P. Sixma J.J. Nature. 1985; 318: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 8Watson S.P. Gibbons J. Immunol.

Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in platelet adhesion, data from confocal videomicroscopic studies suggest that GpIbα-VWF association contributes to platelet aggregation and thrombus growth (9Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 10Ruggeri Z.M. Dent J.A. Saldivar E. Blood. 1999; 94: 172-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the one of the most common congenital bleeding disorders with a prevalence of at least 100/million individuals (11Rodeghiero F. Castaman G. Dini E. Blood. 1987; 69: 454-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sadler J.E. Mannucci P.M. Berntorp E. Bochkov N. Boulyjenkov V. Ginsburg D. Meyer D. Peake I. Rodeghiero F. Srivastava A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Type 2B VWD is caused by a qualitative abnormality of VWF in which normal sized multimers of VWF are secreted, and platelet-VWF interaction is augmented by increased affinity of VWF for GpIbα that does not require any mediating substance (13Ruggeri Z.M. Pareti F.I. Mannucci P.M. Ciavarella N. Zimmerman T.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 302: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14DeMarco L. Mazzucato M. DeRoia D. Casonato A. Fererici A.B. Girolami A. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 86: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, this gain-of-function is associated with bleeding, perhaps because the largest multimers spontaneously associate with platelets, leaving the circulation deficient in large potent forms of VWF (13Ruggeri Z.M.

A. 1985; 82: 7424-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). At least 14 distinct mutations are associated with type 2B VWD (1Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 17Ginsberg D. Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 18Budde U. Schneppenheim R. Rev. Clin. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 5: 335-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and most of these mutations cluster in a single disulfide loop of the VWF A1 domain between residues Cys509 and Cys695 (17Ginsberg D.

In a viscosimeter at low shear, VWF with type 2B mutations bind to platelets constitutively, however binding of wild-type VWF requires the presence of biological agents like ristocetin (22Murata M.

Blood. 1991; 78: 2310-2317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that this disulfide loop encompasses the binding sites for GpIbα, heparin, and sulfatides. Platelet-type or “pseudo” VWD is associated with mutations in GpIbα that enhance affinity for VWF in the absence of injury and elevated shear stress, including Met239 to Val substitution (26Russell S.D. Roth G.J. Blood. 1993; 81: 1787-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Miller J.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 758: 865-869Google Scholar, 28Moriki T. Murata M. Kitaguchi T. Anbo H. Handa M. Watanabe K. Takahashi H. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1997; 90: 698-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patients with either type 2B or platelet-type VWD show similar abnormalities, including loss of high molecular weight multimers of VWF in plasma, increased ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation, prolonged bleeding time, and intermittent thrombocytopenia (13Ruggeri Z.M.

Crystal structures of the unliganded VWF A1 domain (A1), the unliganded extracellular domain of GpIbα, and a complex comprised of gain-of-function mutants of GpIbα and A1 have been determined (33Emsley J. Cruz M. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10396-10401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 34Uff S. Clemetson J.M. Harrison T. Clemetson K.J. Emsley J.

Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The overall fold of GpIbα consists of a central domain of eight leucine-rich repeats that is flanked by a β-hairpin at the N-terminal end (residues Cys4-Cys17) and a conserved disulfide loop and the anionic region at the C-terminal end (34Uff S.

Structural, biochemical, and mutagenesis data identify two sites on the concave face of GpIbα that interact with A1, the N-terminal β-hairpin and a flexible loop at the C-terminal end termed the regulatory “β-switch” region, which undergoes conformational rearrangement upon binding of VWF (35Huizinga E.G.

Based on the 3.1-Å co-crystal structure and binding data, it has been proposed that type 2B VWD mutations increase the affinity of GpIbα-A1 interaction by displacing the N and C termini of A1 that could otherwise block GpIbα binding (35Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Shiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). An alternate mechanism, based on the structure of A1 mutant I546V, has been proposed suggesting that this mutation causes positional changes in the β2-β3-hairpin of A1 (27 Å away) that result in a higher affinity for GpIbα (38Celikel R. Ruggeri Z.M. Varughese K.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, binding studies of VWD mutants have indicated that both type 2B and platelet-type VWD mutations enhance platelet adhesion, in part, by reducing the GpIbα-A1 dissociation rate (31Doggett T.A. Girdhar G. Lawshe A. Schmidtke D.W. Laurenzi I.J. Diamond S.L. Diacovo T.G. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 194-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Doggett T.A. Girdhar G. Lawshe A. Miller J.L. Laurenzi I.J. Diamond S.L. Diacovo T.G. Blood. 2003; 102: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the structural basis for the enhancement of adhesion observed with VWD mutations and to identify specific changes associated with these mutations, we have crystallized a complex comprised of the extracellular domain of GpIbα and the wild-type A1 domain of VWF and determined the structure at a 2.6-Å resolution. Comparison of this GpIbα-A1 structure with unliganded GpIbα, the A1 domain, and the co-structure of the complex containing gain-of-function proteins GpIbα-M239V and A1-R543Q reveals a conformational rearrangement within the regions of GpIbα and A1 that form the binding surfaces of these proteins. The structural changes accompanying both mutations provide a rationale for the observed enhanced binding in VWD. Expression and Purification—Constructs encoding residues 1–305 of the mutated GpIbα domain lacking sites of glycosylation (N21D and N159D) were fused to the CH2-CH3 region of human IgG1 via an intervening enterokinase cleavage sequence (Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The sites of N-linked glycosylation are remote from the A1 binding site. GpIbα-Fc was recovered from conditioned medium by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. Monomeric GpIbα domains (residues 1–288, note secondary cleavage site) were produced by digestion of the dimeric GpIbα-Fc with enterokinase (39LaVallie E.R. Rehemtulla A. Racie L.A. DiBlasio E.A. Ferenz C. Grant K.L. Light A. McCoy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23311-23317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The liberated, heterogeneous GpIbα proteins were further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a HiTrap Q-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Amino acid composition analyses and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (in the negative ion modes) after proteolytic digestion were used to determine the GpIbα primary structure. Two peaks from the Q column corresponded to the predicted sizes of GpIbα with either two or three sulfated residues, and only the latter was used for crystal screening. The wild-type A1 domain (residues 496–709, numbering derived from the mature VWF subunit) was expressed as insoluble protein (inclusion bodies) in Escherichia coli cells grown at 37 °C. To express the selenomethionine-substituted form of A1, cells were grown in defined LeMaster medium supplemented with 75 μg/ml selenomethionine, induced at an A600 of 0.47 by the addition of 500 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and harvested after 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysate was centrifuged at 9000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The pellet containing insoluble VWF-A1 was resuspended with 8 m urea, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm dithiothreitol and centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The urea-solubilized A1 domain was subjected to cation exchange chromatography using a Toyopearl SP 550C column at room temperature. The column was developed using a linear gradient from 8 m urea, 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) to 8 m urea, 20 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). The resulting A1-containing fraction was dialyzed against 6 m GdnHCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and diluted 20-fold to 2 m GdnHCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0). Oxidized glutathione was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 16 h at room temperature. Refolded A1 was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) before application to a Toyopearl DEAE 550C column. The unbound fraction from the DEAE column was applied to a Toyopearl CM 550S column. Refolded A1 was recovered using a linear gradient from 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) to 20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) at room temperature. The A1-containing fraction was further purified on a Bio-Rad hydroxyapatite column. Purified A1 was isolated using a linear gradient from 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) to 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 m sodium phosphate monobasic, 0.5 m sodium phosphate dibasic (pH 6.6) at room temperature. Purified A1 was judged to be pure (>95%) by SDS-PAGE. A complex containing GpIbα and A1 complex was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography over Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences). The formation of 1:1 complexes of GpIbα and A1 was confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography prior to crystal screening. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Co-crystals of a complex comprised of GpIbα and selenomethionine-A1 were grown at 18 °C in microseeded hanging drops containing 10 mg/ml protein complex, 13% polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm potassium thiocyanate. Drops were microseeded using crushed crystals of the native GpIbα-A1 complex obtained under similar conditions (12% polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm potassium thiocyanate). The crystals have the symmetry of space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 72.5 Å, b = 116.1 Å, and c = 68.0 Å. Prior to data collection, crystals were briefly transferred to 25% ethylene glycol plus mother liquor and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Throughout data collection, the crystal was maintained at 100 K. Data were collected at the 5.0.2 beam line at the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, CA. Intensities were integrated and scaled using DENZO (40Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) and SCALA (41CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The structure was solved with experimental phases derived from multiwavelength anomalous diffraction at the Se2+ edge (see Table I). Four Se2+ sites were identified by Patterson methods (SHELXS) based on the Bijvoet differences from a three-wavelength anomalous diffraction data set. The “heavy atom” model was then refined against a maximum likelihood target function using SHARP (42de La Fortelle E. Brigogne G.

The final refined model, which includes polypeptide chains of GpIbα (residues 1–265) and of the VWF A1 domain (residues 506–702), as well as 318 water molecules, has a working R value of 0.190 and a free R value of 0.239 (Table I). The stereochemistry is excellent, and there are no backbone torsion angles outside of the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Structural figures were generated using Ribbons (44Carson M. J.

Overall Structure of GpIbα-A1 and Comparison to Unliganded GpIbα and A1—The x-ray crystal structure presented herein (Fig. 1A) shows that the interaction between the wild-type A1 and GpIbα involves the same binding interfaces as in the GpIbα-A1 complex comprised of mutant proteins, described previously (35Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Shiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). As seen in the mutant structure, changes in the conformation between unliganded GpIbα (34Uff S. Clemetson J.M. Harrison T. Clemetson K.J. Emsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 38: 35657-35663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 35Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Shiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P.

Early studies (46Dong J.F. Li C.Q. Lopez J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13946-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 47Marchese P. Murata M. Mazzucato M. Pradella P. DeMarco L. Ware J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) suggested that the sulfated anionic region at the C-terminal end of GpIbα (residues Asp269-Asp287) is important for binding to VWF and presumably represents an additional site of interaction. However, this region is disordered in the wild-type GpIbα-A1 co-structure, as well as in the mutant co-structure, and more recent biochemical evidence shows that deletion of this region does not effect binding affinity to the A1 domain itself (35Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Shiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The A1 domain bound to GpIbα remains mostly unchanged, except for the conformational divergence that is seen in three adjacent regions (Fig. 1, B and C): the N-terminal end (residues beyond Ser510, inclusively), the C-terminal end (residues beyond Glu700), and the α1-β2 loop (residues Arg543-Arg552). In our structure the Cys509-Cys695 disulfide bridge that links the A1 termini is well ordered, but residues N-terminal to Asp506 and C-terminal to Pro702 are disordered. In the unliganded A1 structure an additional stretch of residues at the N-terminal end (Asp498-Asp506) and at the C-terminal end (Glu700-Thr705) extend toward the site of GpIbα interaction, but the significance of these extensions is not clear because of the presence of water-mediated crystal contacts involving several residues within these termini in the unliganded A1 (33Emsley J. Cruz M. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10396-10401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The location of the N-terminal (Asp506-Ser510) and C-terminal (Glu700-Pro703) regions with well defined electron density is quite different in our structure compared with unliganded A1. Differences in these regions and structural disorder in the A1 termini extensions have also been noted previously in comparison of unliganded A1 and the mutant GpIbα-A1 complex (35Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Shiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The substantial rearrangement of the α1-β2 loop in the complex containing wild-type A1 represents a novel observation, which was not apparent in the mutant GpIbα-A1 complex, as will be described in greater detail below. In wild-type A1, the α1-β2 loop is shifted by more than 6 Å and is rotated away from GpIbα upon complex formation (Fig. 1B), whereas the α1-β2 loop of the unliganded A1 adopts a position that would create a steric clash with GpIbα and therefore would be incompatible with receptor binding (Fig. 1C). Comparison of Wild-type and Mutant GpIbα-A1 Co-structures—The overall GpIbα-A1 complex structure is in general similar to that of the GpIbα-M239V-A1-R543Q complex with a root mean square deviation of 1.1 Å after a superposition of 459 matched C-α atoms (Fig. 2). However, a thorough comparison of these co-structures reveals notable changes that have implications with regard to the different binding affinities of these proteins (14DeMarco L. Mazzucato M.

Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Structural Differences in the α1-β2 Loop of A1—The most prominent differences between wild-type and mutant A1 domains are observed more than 15 Å away from the R543Q mutation site. These differences include reconfiguration of the α1-β2 loop and changes involving residues that are in direct contact with GpIbα (Arg571, Glu613). The single amino acid Arg → Gln substitution affects the position of equivalent atoms without extensive disruption of structure in nearby regions. In both structures, with either Arg or Gln present at position 543, main chains of these residues adopt similar conformations and participate in intrahelical hydrogen bonding at the C-terminal end of the α1-helix. Structural deviations associated with main chain rearrangement begin at Leu544 where the orientation of its carbonyl oxygen is flipped relative to its orientation in the mutant complex, thus extending the hydrogen bond capping at the C-terminal end of the α1-helix (Fig. 3). As a result, structural neighbors Arg545 and Ile546"

Binding assays revealed high affinity calcium-independent binding of two overlapping fibrillin-1 fragments (encoded by central exons 18-25 and 24-30) to tropoelastin, which, in microfibrils, map to an exposed “arms” feature adjacent to the beads. A further binding site within an adjacent fragment (encoded by exons 9-17) was within an eight-cysteine motif designated TB2 (encoded by exons 16 and 17). Binding to TB2 was ablated by the presence of N-terminal domains (encoded by exons 1-8) and reduced after deleting the proline-rich region. A novel transglutaminase cross-link between tropoelastin and fibrillin-1 fragment (encoded by exons 9-17) was localized by mass spectrometry to a sequence encoded by exon 17. The high affinity binding and cross-linking of tropoelastin to a central fibrillin-1 sequence confirm that this association is fundamental to elastic fiber formation. Microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1 showed calcium-dependent binding of moderate affinity to fibrillin-1 N-terminal fragment (encoded by exons 1-8), which localize to the beads. Microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1 thus contributes to microfibril organization but may also form secondary interactions with adjacent microfibril-bound tropoelastin.

Elastic fibers are one of the major insoluble fiber systems of connective tissues, providing elasticity and resilience to elastic tissues such as blood vessels, lungs, skin, and ligaments (1Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., New York1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Sherratt M.J.

They morphologically comprise an elastin core surrounded by a mantle of fibrillin-rich microfibrils, and their distinct tissue-specific arrangements reflect different biomechanical requirements. Elastic fiber formation in the extracellular space is a complex developmentally regulated process that has been visualized by electron microscopy studies as the accretion of tropoelastin on preformed bundles of fibrillin microfibrils in the pericellular space. The microfibril template thus profoundly influences tropoelastin deposition and the organization of mature elastic fibers as well as their biomechanical properties (3Sherratt M.J. Baldock C.

Understanding of elastic fiber formation requires delineation of the molecular basis of the critical early stage of tropoelastin deposition on microfibrils.Fibrillin-1 is a large cysteine-rich multidomain glycoprotein that polymerizes in the extracellular space in a head-to-tail manner to form microfibrils that provide a force-bearing structural framework for dynamic connective tissues (2Kielty C.M.

Mutations in fibrillin-1 cause Marfan syndrome, a heritable disease associated with severe aortic, ocular, and skeletal defects due to defective elastic fibers (6Robinson P.N. Booms P. Cell Mol.

Sherratt M.J. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best candidate for an integral structural component is microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1 (MAGP-1), which was first identified as a microfibril-associated molecule in reductive denaturing tissue microfibril extracts (8Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4590-4598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and which routinely co-localizes with microfibrils in elastic and nonelastic tissues (2Kielty C.M.

An antibody inhibition study suggested that the interaction between tropoelastin and microfibrils might be mediated by the N-terminal half of MAGP-1 (13Brown-Augsberger P. Broekelmann T. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Tropoelastin was shown to bind a fibrillin-1 fragment (encoded by exons 10-17) through interactions involving its lysine side chains (14Trask T.M. Trask B.C. Ritty T.M. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J.

Ternary complexes of MAGP-1, fibrillin, and decorin and of MAGP-1, tropoelastin, and biglycan have been identified in vitro (15Reinboth B. Hanssen E. Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 11: 1499-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Whereas small leucine-rich proteoglycans may contribute to elastic fiber formation, available evidence indicates that the key molecules in this process are tropoelastin, fibrillin-1, and MAGP-1.The molecular basis of how tropoelastin binds microfibrils during elastic fiber formation remains unclear, and no comprehensive screening of interactions with fibrillin-1 has been reported. To resolve this critical issue, we have defined the interactions between tropoelastin and MAGP-1 with fibrillin-1 and their binding affinities. We have also identified and localized a novel specific transglutaminase cross-link between tropoelastin and fibrillin-1. The data confirm that tropoelastin strongly binds and is cross-linked to a central fibrillin-1 sequence that is exposed on microfibrils, whereas MAGP-1 binds N-terminal fibrillin-1 and contributes to the microfibril template. These data thus provide essential new insights into the molecular basis of elastic fiber formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Fibrillin-1 Fragments—Recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragments PF1 (encoded by exons 1-11 (residues 1-489)), PF2 (encoded by exons 9-17 (residues 330-722)), PF3 (encoded by exons 1-17 (residues 1-722)), PF4 (encoded by exons 1-8 (residues 1-329)), PF5 (encoded by exons 18-25 (residues 723-1069)), PF6 (encoded by exons 23-25 (residues 910-1069)), PF7 (encoded by exons 24-30 (residues 952-1279)), PF8 (encoded by exons 30-38 (residues 1238-1605)), PF9 (encoded by exons 37-43 (residues 1528-2166)), PF10 (encoded by exons 41-52 (residues 1688-2165)), PF11 (encoded by exons 37-52 (residues 1528-2165)), PF12 (encoded by exons 50-58 (residues 2055-2443)), and PF13 (encoded by exons 58-65 (residues 2402-2871)) (17Pereira L.

The His6 tag could subsequently be removed by enterokinase. In the case of N-terminal fragments PF1 and PF4, enterokinase cleavage generated peptides starting at residue 46, which corresponding to secreted fibrillin-1 molecules that would have undergone N-terminal furin processing (20Kettle S.

Deletion constructs that lacked the proline-rich region were also produced for PF2 and PF3; these were designated PF2Δpro and PF3Δpro. Truncated forms of PF2 (PF2trunc) and PF2Δprotrunc that lacked TB2 (encoded by exons 16 and 17) were column-purified (Fig. 1C). All fragments had their predicted monomeric mass, as judged by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of 10 mm dithiothreitol, size fractionation on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 columns, and laser light scattering, and they also bound calcium, since electrophoretic shifts were apparent following EDTA treatment (21Ashworth J.L.

After harvesting medium from transfected cells by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 5 min), protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma) were added along with 0.5% Triton X-100. Medium was dialyzed overnight into 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol (start buffer) and then overnight again into start buffer containing 8 m urea; these conditions allowed subsequent elution of MAGP-1 from the nickel column as a single purified product. The dialyzed medium was then pumped over a Ni2+-charged 1-ml HiTrap Chelate HP column (Amersham Biosciences) using an ΔKTAprime system (Amersham Biosciences) at 1 ml/min. The column containing bound protein was then washed with 30 ml of start buffer containing 8 m urea. To remove the Triton X-100, the column was then washed with 10 ml of start buffer with 8 m urea but without Triton X-100. MAGP-1 was then eluted from the column using a 10-ml gradient of 10-400 mm imidazole in start buffer with 8 m urea but without Triton X-100 at 0.7 ml/min and collected in 0.5-ml fractions. Eluted MAGP-1 was refolded slowly by dialysis into 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 (TBS/CaCl2) containing 2 mm reduced glutathione, 0.2 mm oxidized glutathione, and 0.005% Tween 20, followed by dialysis into TBS. Purified MAGP-1 monomers exhibited a molecular mass of 31 kDa on reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D). In nonreducing conditions, MAGP-1 appeared both as 31-kDa monomers and as a range of high Mr multimers (Fig. 1D).Solid Phase Binding Assays—Solid phase binding assays utilized recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragments PF1, PF2, PF2trunc, PF2Δpro, PF2Δprotrunc, PF3, PF3Δpro, PF4, PF5, PF7, PF8, PF9, PF10, PF11, PF12, and PF13 (processed) and full-length MAGP-1 and tropoelastin.For tropoelastin binding assays, tropoelastin was adsorbed onto wells that were then blocked prior to the addition of soluble fibrillin-1 or MAGP-1 ligands. For studying MAGP-1 interactions with fibrillin-1, fibrillin-1 fragments were bound to the wells prior to the addition of soluble MAGP-1. The soluble ligands were either biotinylated or detected using antibodies, and the binding assays were conducted at 37 °C. The block for biotinylated ligands was bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the block for nonbiotinylated ligands was milk protein.For assays using biotinylated ligands, each fibrillin-1 fragment or MAGP-1 was rotated at room temperature for 30 min with an approximate 10-fold molar excess of 10 mg/ml solution of Immunopure sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-biotin (Pierce) diluted in PBS. Each mixture was then dialyzed against several changes of 0.02 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.001 m CaCl2 (TBSa/CaCl2) to remove excess biotin. Flat bottomed microtiter plates (ThermoLabsystems; Franklin, MA) were coated with MAGP-1 or tropoelastin at 5 μg/ml in TBSa/CaCl2, overnight at 37 °C. The plates were then incubated with TBSa/CaCl2 and 5% BSA for at least 2 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites, followed by three washes with TBSa/CaCl2 containing 0.1% BSA. Initially, 5 μg/ml fibrillin-1 protein fragments spanning the length of the molecule were screened for binding to tropoelastin and MAGP-1 by incubating in TBSa/CaCl2 for 3 h or overnight at 37 °C. For detailed binding curves of the fibrillin-1 fragments that were found to bind, biotinylation was carried out before the addition at concentrations from 0 to 50 μg/ml in TBSa/CaCl2 for 3 h or overnight at 37 °C. Plates were then washed three times before detection of bound fibrillin-1. Biotinylated ligands were quantified by incubating with 1:200 dilution of ExtraAvidin-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in TBSa/CaCl2 at room temperature for 10-15 min. For nonbiotinylated fibrillin-1 binding experiments, bound ligand was detected by incubation with anti-His6 antibody (Novagen) diluted 1:1000 in TBSa/CaCl2 for 3 h followed by anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:2000 in TBSa/CaCl2. For both methods, wells were then washed four times, and the color was developed using 40 mm 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) solution (Sigma) for ∼10-20 min at room temperature. Plates were read at a wavelength of 405 nm. Any nonspecific biotinylated MAGP-1 or fibrillin-1 binding was detected by blocking precoated wells before incubation with biotinylated ligand. For the antibody detection assay, nonspecific binding was detected using immobilized tropoelastin and antibody only. All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice to confirm observed results. We used biotinylation as it is a widely used and sensitive molecular detection system. In addition, where antibodies were available, we also monitored binding assays immunologically. In all cases, similar patterns of binding were recorded, so biotinylation did not affect the binding interactions.Competition Binding Assays—Competition binding assays were also conducted using both nonbiotinylated and biotinylated soluble proteins. Flat bottomed microtiter plates were coated with tropoelastin at 5 μg/ml in TBSa/CaCl2, overnight at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were then blocked with TBSa/CaCl2 containing 5% BSA at room temperature for at least 2 h. The plates were washed three times with TBSa/CaCl2 and incubated with 5 μg/ml nonbiotinylated MAGP-1 or fibrillin-1 fragments in TBSa/CaCl2 overnight at 37 °C. The plates were then washed again three times, and then 5 μg/ml appropriate second biotinylated protein in TBSa/CaCl2 was added overnight at 37 °C. Control wells with the first nonbiotinylated soluble ligand not added were incubated in TBSa/CaCl2 only. After a further three washes, plates were incubated with 1:200 dilution of extravidin peroxidase conjugate at room temperature for 15 min. Bound protein was quantified after four more washes by the colorimetric assay described above, using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) solution for 10-20 min at room temperature. Plates were read at a wavelength of 405 nm. All experiments were done in quadruplicate wells.Biacore 3000 Kinetic Analysis of Molecular Interactions—For kinetic binding studies of MAGP-1 and fibrillin-1 fragments by surface plasmon resonance, a Biacore biosensor was used (Biacore 3000; Biacore AB). MAGP-1 or tropoelastin was immobilized onto CM5 sensor chips by amine coupling using 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride, N-hydroxysuccinimide, and ethanolamine-HCl, as described by the manufacturer. MAGP-1 was immobilized on the chip in sodium acetate, pH 3.0, giving 2028 resonance units. Tropoelastin was immobilized on the chip in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, giving 12,100 resonance units. All subsequent binding experiments were performed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% surfactant P20 (designated HBS-Ca).MAGP-1 binding analysis was performed for fibrillin-1 protein fragments encompassing full-length fibrillin-1, as analytes, at two concentrations (40 and 200 nm) and a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 3 min. After 5 min of dissociation, the chip was regenerated in HBS-Ca containing 400 mm NaCl for 60 s. The chip was then stabilized for 20 min using HBS-Ca before the next injection was carried out. The analyte was simultaneously passed over a blank capped flow cell, and this base line was subtracted from the experimental flow cell. The maximum relative response value for each injection was calculated using the binding assay result wizard (Biacore control software 3.0).Kinetic analysis was then performed using the MAGP-1 bound chips and the fibrillin-1 fragments PF1 and PF4 that were shown in analyte screening to bind MAGP-1. PF9 and PF12 were also tested as negative controls. Protein fragments were injected at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 25 μg/ml at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Samples were injected for 3 min, dissociated for 15 min, regenerated for 1 min using HBS-Ca containing 400 mm NaCl, and then stabilized for 20 min before the next injection. After subtraction of each response value from the blank cell, association and dissociation rate constants were determined by separate ka/kd fitting to the steepest parts of the binding and dissociation curves. All curves were fitted using 1:1 Langmuir association/dissociation model (BIAevaluation 3.0; Biacore AB). A saturation binding curve was also plotted by performing a four-parameter mathematical fit to calculate the top of the sensorgram curve at infinite time (Ri); this was possible because all of the sensorgrams leveled off before the injection end. The Ri value was then plotted against concentration, and the KD and Bmax values could be calculated using nonlinear regression (one-site binding (hyperbola) GraphPad Prism version 2.0).To investigate the effects of EDTA on binding of PF1 to MAGP-1, kinetic analysis was also performed using 40 nm PF1 and 0.01-10 mm EDTA in HBS-Ca. An inhibition curve was then calculated using the Ri value of each curve, as described above. Similar experiments were conducted to assess the potential effects of EDTA on binding of PF5 and PF7 to tropoelastin. To determine whether direct binding of MAGP-1 to the chip influenced its ability to bind fibrillin-1, MAGP-1 was also bound to the surface of a CM5 sensor chip, at saturating levels, using an immobilized polyclonal antibody (PR315; Elastin Products Inc.). Fibrillin-1 fragments were passed over the antibody-bound MAGP-1 at concentrations of 200 and 1000 nm, as described for the directly immobilized MAGP-1.Using CM5 chips with tropoelastin immobilized, kinetic analysis of tropoelastin interactions were performed using all of the fibrillin-1 fragments and MAGP-1, as analytes, at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 60 μg/ml at a flow rate 30 μl/min. Samples were injected for 3 min and dissociated for 15 min, as described for MAGP-1, except that the regeneration step used two 30-s injections of 1 m NaCl, 50 mm NaOH, and then stabilization was for 20 min before the next injection. The blank cell response was subtracted, and association and dissociation rate constants were calculated separately, as described for MAGP-1.Cross-linking of Tropoelastin and Fibrillin-1 Using Transglutaminase—1 μg of tropoelastin was incubated with 1 μg of fragments scanning the entire fibrillin-1 molecule, with and without 0.1 μg of transglutaminase (guinea pig liver; Sigma) for 2 h at 30 °C. This was performed in a volume of 10 μl to give protein concentration of 2 μm for both fibrillin and tropoelastin. Samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Tropoelastin was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody BA-4 (Sigma).Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Transglutaminase-cross-linked Tropoelastin-PF2—To analyze the cross-linked complexes of tropoelastin and fibrillin-1 by mass spectrometry, 10 μg each of fibrillin-1 fragment PF2 and tropoelastin were incubated with 1 μg of transglutaminase in a volume of 30 μl (12.5 μm for each protein) for 2 h. Ni2+-chelate resin was then added in order to purify the PF2 and PF2-tropoelastin heterodimers and larger cross-linked complexes from the mixture. The resin was then washed twice in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 (TBS/CaCl2) followed by centrifugation to remove unbound noncross-linked tropoelastin and the transglutaminase; bound fibrillin-1 fragments, with or without cross-linked tropoelastin, were then eluted in 8 m urea, 400 mm imidazole. Samples were reduced by the addition of 9 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by alkylation at room temperature by the addition of 20 mm imidazole for 15 min. Samples were then resolved using SDS-PAGE. Bands were visualized by colloidal Coomassie stain (Sigma), excised using a clean scalpel, and cut into 1-mm sections. The gel slices were washed twice in 200 μl of H2O, followed by dehydration using 200 μl of 50% acetonitrile. The slices were quickly washed in 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate before the addition of 20 μl of 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 0.2 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). The gel slices were incubated at 37 °C overnight. For digestion using chymotrypsin after dehydration, gel slices were washed and then incubated in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2 μg of chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science) and incubated at 25 °C overnight. Digestion using endoproteinase Asp-N was performed in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 μg of endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Applied Science). After digestion and centrifugation, the digestion buffer supernatant was removed and saved, whereas further tryptic peptides were extracted twice more in 20 μl of 70% acetonitrile for 15 min. All supernatants were then pooled, and the acetonitrile was removed by speed vacuum, until the volume was reduced to 10-20 μl. 0.1% formic acid was then added, prior to analysis using a μQ-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass). Samples were also desalted using ZipTip C18 pipette tips (Millipore) prior to analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.RESULTSSolid Phase Binding of Fibrillin-1 to Tropoelastin—In order to determine how tropoelastin interacts with fibrillin-1, solid phase binding assays were conducted at 37 °C, with tropoelastin bound to the wells and binding of soluble biotinylated or nonbiotinylated fibrillin-1 fragments detected. Fibrillin-1 fragment PF2, which contains the proline-rich region, fragment PF5, fragment PF7, and fragment PF13 showed strongly significant binding to tropoelastin (Fig. 2A). Fragments PF2 and PF5, which span fibrillin-1 exons 9-25, showed dose-dependent and saturating binding (Fig. 3, A and B). Fibrillin-1 fragments PF11 and FP12 bound more weakly to tropoelastin.Fig. 2Solid phase binding assays of soluble fibrillin-1 fragments to immobilized tropoelastin. Tropoelastin was coated to the plastic surface of multiwell plates at 5 μg/ml and incubated with fibrillin fragments at 5 μg/ml at 37 °C. The wells were then blocked using 4% milk in TBSa/CaCl2. A, binding of fibrillin-1 fragments spanning the length of the molecule to tropoelastin-coated wells. B, binding of fibrillin-1 fragments PF2 and PF3Δpro and truncated variants to tropoelastin-coated wells. C, binding of fibrillin-1 fragments PF2 and truncated PF2 to tropoelastin-coated wells. D, binding of fibrillin fragments PF2, PF5, PF7, and PF13 to tropoelastin with (gray) or without (black) incubation with 10 mm EDTA. The negative control was incubated with buffer only.

https://openalex.org/W1999241959,"Cellular responses to wounding have often been studied at a molecular level after disrupting cell layers by mechanical means. This invariably results in damage to cells at the edges of the wounds, which has been suggested to be instrumental for initiating wound healing. To test this, we devised an alternative procedure to introduce gaps in layers of corneal epithelial cells by casting agarose strips on tissue culture plates. In contrast to mechanical wounding, removal of the strips did not lead to detectable membrane leakage or to activation of the stress-activated kinase JNK. Nonetheless, cells at the edge underwent the typical morphological transition to a highly motile phenotype, and the gaps closed at rates similar to those of mechanically induced wounds. To allow biochemical analysis of cell extracts, a procedure was devised that makes cell-free surface area acutely available to a large proportion of cells in culture. Rapid activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was detected by immunoblotting, and the addition of an EGFR-blocking antibody completely abolished wound healing. In addition, wound healing was inhibited by agents that block signaling by the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF). Cells stimulated with cell-free tissue culture surface released a soluble factor that induced activation of the EGFR, which was distinct from HB-EGF. These studies suggest that the triggering event for the induction of motility in corneal epithelial cells is related to the sudden availability of permissive surface area rather than to mechanical damage, and they demonstrate a central role of signaling through HB-EGF."
https://openalex.org/W2090166013,"Tissue factor (TF) is the physiological activator of the coagulation cascade that plays pathophysiological roles in metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Downstream in coagulation, thrombin is the central protease that signals through G protein-coupled, protease-activated receptors (PARs). However, the TF-VIIa-Xa complex upstream in coagulation also activates PAR1 and 2. Here, we address the question of whether signaling of the TF initiation complex is a relevant pathway that leads to TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation. In heterologous expression systems and primary endothelial cells, we demonstrate that the ternary TF-VIIa-Xa complex induces TF phosphorylation specifically by activating PAR2 but not through PAR1 signaling. In addition, TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation is induced only by TF-dependent signaling but not by other coagulation factors in endothelial cells. Phosphorylation of the Pro-directed kinase target site Ser258 is dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser253 by protein kinase C (PKC) α. TF phosphorylation is somewhat delayed and coincides with sustained PKCα activation downstream of PAR2 but not PAR1 signaling. Phosphatidylcholine-dependent phospholipase C is the major pathway that leads to prolonged PKCα recruitment downstream of PAR2. Thus, PAR2 signaling specifically phosphorylates TF in a receptor cross-talk that distinguishes upstream from downstream coagulation protease signaling.

Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence established an essential in vivo role of PAR signaling for platelet activation and the hemostatic response (2Sambrano G.R. Weiss E.J. Zheng Y.-W. Coughlin S.R.

However, PAR signaling also has important nonhemostatic functions in development (4Griffin C.T. Srinavasan Y. Zheng Y.-W. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Science. 2001; 293: 1666-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), inflammation (5Coughlin S.R. Camerer E. J. Clin.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All PARs, except for PAR2, are directly activated by thrombin, and PAR signaling is typically attributed to the action of thrombin in vivo. However, in vitro evidence indicates that thrombin receptors are also targets for other proteases at meaningful physiological concentrations (7Pendurthi U.R. Ngyuen M. Andrade-Gordon P. Petersen L.C.

Cellular receptors can concentrate serine proteases at the cell surface for PAR cleavage (11Ruf W. Dorfleutner A. Riewald M. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1495-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). More importantly, protease co-factors, such as tissue factor (TF) and endothelial cell protein C receptor, couple the initiation of the pro- and anti-coagulant pathways to PAR signaling by retaining transiently the initial protease products Xa and activated protein C on the cell surface (9Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 10Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Different PARs produce only partially redundant signaling responses in vascular cells. In the case of PAR1 and PAR2, the predominant endothelial cell expressed PARs, several immediate early gene induction events are overlapping, but only PAR1 signaling induces the mRNA for monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (10Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). PAR signaling induces distinct cytoskeletal effects. PAR1 is a potent activator of the small GTPase Rho, which leads to the disruption of intercellular junctions and to increased permeability of the endothelium (12Klarenbach S.W. Chipiuk A. Nelson R.C. Hollenberg M.D. Murray A.G. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Vouret-Craviari V. Grall D. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, PAR2 activation promotes cell motility by activation of the Rac/p21-activated kinase pathway and by forming a scaffolding complex containing β-arrestin and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). This complex is implicated in pseudopodia extension and chemotaxis (14DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Déry O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N. J.

PAR selectivity is corroborated by in vivo studies demonstrating that agonist peptides specific for PAR1 and PAR2 elicit selective responses in vascular tone (16Damiano B.P. Cheung W.M. Santulli R.J.

Zheng Y.-W. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Science. 2001; 293: 1666-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, protease signaling specificity is in part dependent on the signal transducing PAR, but additional complexity possibly arises from the co-factors/protease receptors that assist PAR cleavage. In the initiation phase of coagulation, TF is involved in two signaling complexes: the TF-VIIa complex that activates PAR2 and the ternary TF-VIIa-Xa complex in which Xa cleaves PAR1 or PAR2 (8Riewald M.

Because the ternary complex activates PAR1 and PAR2, it is an unresolved question whether immediate or delayed responses distinguish between TF-dependent signaling through PAR1 or PAR2. In this study we further characterize how the TF cytoplasmic domain becomes phosphorylated in endothelial cells. Although TF phosphorylation can be induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation (20Zioncheck T.F. Roy S. Vehar G.A. J. Biol.

Here, we show that PAR2 but not PAR1 signaling induces TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation. PMA-induced TF phosphorylation in endothelial cells was found to involve PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of Ser253 (22Dorfleutner A. Ruf W. Blood. 2003; 102: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and subsequent phosphorylation of Ser258 by a potential Pro-directed kinase (20Zioncheck T.F. Roy S. Vehar G.A. J. Biol.

Whereas PKCα is activated downstream of PAR1 and PAR2 signaling, sustained membrane recruitment of PKCα is specific for PAR2 signaling and coincides with the onset of TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation. TF phosphorylation is a characteristic response of the initiation phase of coagulation and thus distinguishes PAR signaling in the upstream and downstream coagulation reaction. Materials—VIIa, inactive Ser195 to Ala VIIa (iVIIa), factors IXa, X and Xa, thrombin, and PAR agonist peptides TFLLRNPNDK (PAR1) and SLIGRL (PAR2) were as described (8Riewald M. Kravchenko V.V.

Sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science), chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostics, Greenwich, CT), PAR2 antibody SAM11 and PKCα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and phospho- and non-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) were obtained commercially. Hirudin, conventional PKC inhibitors Gö6983 and Gö6976, PKCα inhibitor Safingol, and PKCβ inhibitor Hispidin were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).

Wild-type and kinase inactive PKCα (K368N) constructs were gifts from Dr. Alex Toker (Boston, MA). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing full-length TF (CHO/TF cells) (27Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1372-1378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were transiently transfected by electroporation. Cells (2 × 107) in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm HEPES combined with 20 μg of PAR1 or PAR2 cDNA constructs received a single pulse (250 V, 500 microfarads) in a gene pulser (Bio-Rad). The experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Adenoviral Vectors and Transduction of Endothelial Cells—Ad5 serotype vectors for full-length and C245S-mutated TF were described in detail (22Dorfleutner A. Ruf W. Blood. 2003; 102: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ser253 to Ala TF, generated by PCR mutagenesis, and PAR1 and PAR2 cDNA were similarly subcloned into adenoviral vectors. The virus was plaque-purified twice, expanded for large scale production, and purified on CsCl gradient. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) or Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) and cultured in EGM medium containing 2–5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 μg/ml human epidermal growth factor, and 3 mg/ml bovine brain extract. HUVECs were transduced for 4–6 h, and the experiments were performed 48 h later. Typically, the cells were transferred to serum-free medium for 2–4 h with the fresh medium, before the agonists were added. To monitor the levels of Xa, an aliquot of culture supernatant was quenched in buffer containing EDTA, and the Xa concentrations were determined by hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme FXa, based on calibration curves of purified Xa. Western Blotting and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis— From cells treated with inhibitors and agonists, TF was immunoprecipitated in the case of CHO cells and PAR1-deficient fibroblasts. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells or endothelial cells were directly lysed in reducing sample buffer for Western blot analysis with phosphorylation (αP-TFCD) or pan-specific (α-TFCD) antibody to the TF-cytoplasmic domain (22Dorfleutner A. Ruf W. Blood. 2003; 102: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To assess surface expression of TF, PAR1, or PAR2, the cells were harvested with EDTA and resuspended in serum-free medium, 2 mm CaCl2. To determine PAR internalization, the cells were stimulated with ternary TF-VIIa-Xa (10 nm iVIIa, 20 nm Xa, 100 nm NAPc2) complex or PAR agonist peptides for 30 min at 37 °C. Residual expression was detected by staining on ice for PAR1 (WEDE-15) or PAR2 (SAM11), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody and flow cytometry (FACScan; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Translocation of PKCα from Cytosol to Membrane—Transduced, serum-starved (4 h) HUVECs were stimulated with ternary complex (iVIIa/Xa/NAPc2, 10/20/100 nm) or PMA (20 ng/ml) for 1 and 10 min and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm orthovanadate. The cells were harvested by scraping in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, aprotinin (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicated twice (10 s pulse; Heat System, Ultrasonic Inc.). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min, and the membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for1hat 4 °C (28Goldberg M. Zhang H.L. Steinberg S.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The membrane fractions were resuspended in the same buffer, 1% Triton X-100, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using equal protein loading for Western blotting with anti-PKCα antibody. The presented data are representative of experiments repeated at least three times. The quantitations are shown as the means and standard deviations. TF Cytoplasmic Domain Phosphorylation Is Dependent on PAR2 Signaling in Heterologous Expression Systems—PAR signaling may activate PKC, which in PMA-stimulated cells triggers TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation (20Zioncheck T.F. Roy S. Vehar G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3561-3564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mody R.S. Carson S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7869-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Dorfleutner A. Ruf W. Blood. 2003; 102: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In TF transfected CHO (CHO/TF) cells, the TF cytoplasmic domain was phosphorylated in response to PMA stimulation, demonstrating expression of relevant kinases that phosphorylate TF. However, neither PAR1 nor PAR2 agonists induced TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). CHO/TF cells express endogenous PAR1, but not PAR2 (9Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To address the role of PAR2, CHO/TF cells were transfected to express human PAR2 (CHO/TF/PAR2) (9Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) or uncleavable PAR2 in which the P1 Arg residue was changed to Gln (CHO/TF/PAR2/P1). PAR2 agonist peptide induced TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation in both cell lines (Fig. 1B). To induce TF-dependent signaling, we used NAPc2 as an experimental tool to lock in the ternary TF-VIIa-Xa complex. In the NAPc2 stabilized TF-VIIa-Xa complex, VIIa is inhibited, but Xa is catalytically active and signaling competent, which mimics the characteristics of signaling in TF-initiated coagulation, where Xa is generated on cells exposed to VIIa and X (9Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Unlike PAR2 agonist stimulation, the NAPc2 stabilized TF-VIIa-Xa signaling complex induced TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation only in cells that expressed cleavage-sensitive PAR2. Thus, cleavage of PAR2 by the ternary TF-VIIa-Xa complex induces TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation, and simply forming the ternary complex is not sufficient to induce TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation in PAR2-expressing cells. To exclude the possibility that the lack of phosphorylation in response to PAR1 agonist stimulation in CHO/TF cells was due to low expression levels of hamster PAR1, CHO/TF cells were transiently transfected with either human PAR1 or human PAR2. Receptor expression was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). Expression of PAR1 or PAR2 resulted in similar PAR agonist or ternary complex-mediated ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1D), as well as in comparable degrees of agonist-induced PAR1 or PAR2 internalization (Fig. 1E). These data are consistent with similar efficiency of PAR1 or PAR2 activation by ternary complex signaling. However, only PAR2 expression resulted in ternary complexinduced TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Thus, despite activating PAR1 as well as PAR2, ternary complex signaling caused TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation specifically through PAR2 activation. PAR2 Signaling Is Sufficient to Support TF Cytoplasmic Domain Phosphorylation—Because endogenous PAR1 was coexpressed in PAR2-transfected CHO cells, it remained unclear whether PAR1 is required, albeit not sufficient to trigger TF phosphorylation. To address this question, fibroblasts from PAR1-deficient mice that also lack other PARs (9Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 19Camerer E. Kataoka H. Kahn M. Lease K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16081-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) were used. PMA-stimulated TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation is negatively regulated by palmitoylation of the cytoplasmic Cys245 residue in endothelial cells (22Dorfleutner A. Ruf W. Blood. 2003; 102: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and mutation of Cys245 greatly facilitates the detection of TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation. PAR-1-deficient fibroblasts were co-transduced with adenovirus to express human Cys245 to Ser mutated TF together with PAR2 or PAR1, achieving expression levels shown in Fig. 2A. The cells were stimulated with PAR1 or PAR2 agonist peptides, and with thrombin, trypsin, or ternary complex as relevant proteases that activate PARs. No TF phosphorylation was observed in PAR1-expressing cells, but TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation was observed in PAR2-transduced cells stimulated with appropriate PAR2 agonists (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that endogenous PAR1 is not required in the signaling pathway that phosphorylates TF. Note the more quickly migrating form of TF in the loading control that was performed by reprobing with pan-specific anti-TF cytoplasmic domain antibody. We had previously found in PMA-stimulated cells that certain N-linked carbohydrate isoforms of TF cannot be phosphorylated (22Dorfleutner A. Ruf W. Blood. 2003; 102: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The lack of phosphorylation of the more quickly migrating forms of TF in this and other experiments shown below indicates that Golgi-dependent carbohydrate modification, and thus presumably a certain subcellular protein trafficking route, is also important for phosphorylation of the TF cytoplasmic domain in response to PAR2 activation. TF Cytoplasmic Domain Phosphorylation of Endogenously Expressed TF—To provide evidence that endogenously expressed TF can be phosphorylated downstream of PAR2 signaling, we studied MDA-MB-231 cells. Under our culture conditions, this breast cancer cell line expressed fairly low levels of PAR2 but high levels of PAR1 and TF (Fig. 2C). MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated by directly adding PAR1 or PAR2 agonist peptides to the culture supernatant. Sustained TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation was observed in cell stimulated with PAR2 but not in cells stimulated with PAR1 agonist peptide (Fig. 2D). The robust phosphorylation in response to PAR2 agonist peptide is remarkable, considering the fairly low levels of cell surface-expressed PAR2 relative to PAR1. Thus, in cells that express endogenous TF, PAR1, and PAR2, TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation occurs specifically downstream of PAR2 signaling. TF Cytoplasmic Domain Phosphorylation Is Specific for Upstream Coagulation Signaling in Primary Cells—The relative importance of PAR1 and PAR2 signaling in TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation was analyzed in primary HUVECs transduced with adenovirus to express TF and variable levels of PAR1 and PAR2. HUVECs express endogenous PAR1 (Fig. 3A, UT) and very little PAR2 (data not shown). HUVECs were adenovirus transduced to achieve comparable expression levels of PAR1 or PAR2. PAR activation was confirmed by measuring internalization by flow cytometry and stimulation with the NAPc2 stabilized ternary complex similarly induced internalization of both receptors (Fig. 3B). With both PAR1 and PAR2, internalization by TF-dependent signaling was somewhat less efficient when compared with the cleavage by thrombin and trypsin, respectively. Consistent with data in the CHO cell model, activation of endogenous PAR1 (not shown) or overexpressed PAR1 did not induce TF phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). In contrast, introducing PAR2 with TF resulted in TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation after 10 min of stimulation with ternary complex, PAR2 agonist, or trypsin. Co-expression of PAR2 with Cys245 to Ser mutated TF at similar levels as wild-type TF resulted in significantly enhanced TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation after 10 min of stimulation (Fig. 3C) and PAR1 stimulation was also not sufficient to induce phosphorylation of this mutant (data not shown). The differences in TF phosphorylation between wild-type and mutant TF were quantified by densitometry, using normalization for slight differences in expression levels. TF was phosphorylated ∼7-fold more efficiently when thioester modification of Cys245 was prevented by mutagenesis (n = 3). The specificity of TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation in response to other coagulation proteases was analyzed in HUVECs expressing PAR2 and Cys245 to Ser mutated TF. The cells were stimulated for 1 h to increase the sensitivity for detecting inefficient responses, but high concentrations of factor IXa and activated protein C as well as thrombin did not induce TF phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). These are important data, because thrombin-cleaved PAR1 has been shown to cross-activate PAR2 (24O'Brien P.J. Prevost N. Molino M. Hollinger M.K. Woolkalis M.J. Woulfe D.S. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13502-13509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Whereas the NAPc2 stabilized TF-VIIa-Xa ternary complex triggered TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation with efficiency similar to that of a direct PAR2 agonist, signaling by VIIa (50 nm) alone produced less efficient TF phosphorylation in HUVEC monolayers. In contrast, stimulation with VIIa and X, which mimics activation of coagulation, efficiently induced TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation. In these experiments, Xa activity was blocked by adding a Xa inhibitor (NAP5) before free Xa reached levels that could activate PAR2. The efficiency of ternary complex signaling is further illustrated in the middle panel of Fig. 3D with cells stimulated for only 10 min. The reaction with VIIa and X generated <10 nm Xa in this time period but lead to more efficient TF phosphorylation in comparison with free Xa at concentrations as high as 50 nm. In the right panel, the cells were stimulated with VIIa and X in the presence of the potent Xa inhibitor NAP5. Blocking Xa activity prevented TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation, confirming our previous conclusions (9Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) that in the ternary TF-VIIa-Xa coagulation initiation complex signaling is induced by Xa and not VIIa. Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that phosphorylation of the TF cytoplasmic domain occurs as a result of the activation of a highly specific signaling pathway following the initiation of coagulation. PAR2 Signaling Induces Sustained PKCα Activation—The phosphorylation-specific antibody to TF recognizes the conformational change induced by phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic Ser258 residue that probably is the target for a Pro-directed kinase (20Zioncheck T.F. Roy S. Vehar G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3561-3564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mody R.S. Carson S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7869-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Dorfleutner A. Ruf W. Blood. 2003; 102: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of Ser253 appears to be required for PMA-induced Ser258 phosphorylation in HUVEC (22Dorfleutner A. Ruf W. Blood. 2003; 102: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mutation of either the PKC phosphorylation site Ser253 or the PKC consensus recognition residues Lys255 abolished TF phosphorylation induced by PAR2-dependent ternary complex signaling (Fig. 4A). TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation was also blocked by inhibitors for conventional PKCs (α, β, and γ), Gö6976, and Gö6983, as well the PKCα-selective inhibitor Safingol but not the PKCβ-inhibitor Hispidin (Fig. 4B). To further demonstrate PKC specificity, we overexpressed wild-type PKCα or kinase-inactive, Lys368 to Asn mutated PKCα constructs. Ternary complex-induced TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation was significantly inhibited in cells expressing dominant negative, inactive PKCα, as compared with vector control or wild-type PKCα transfected cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, PKCα is important for TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation downstream of PAR2, presumably by targeting the PKC phosphorylation site at Ser253. Thrombin-mediated PAR1 signaling activates PKCα in endothelial cells to increase permeability (29Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Holinstat M. Mehta D. Kozasa T. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28793-28798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but PAR2-mediated PKCα activation is poorly characterized. TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation induced by PAR2 agonist or ternary complex signaling occurs with somewhat delayed kinetics, being undetectable 1 min and reaching maximal levels 5–10 min after stimulation (Fig. 5A). Translocation of conventional PKCs from the cytosol to the membrane is required for their kinase activity (31Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). To analyze the relation of TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation and PKCα activation, we determined the membrane translocation of PKCα at the 1- and 10-min time points. Fig. 5B shows that the ternary complex stimulated rapid (1 min) PKCα translocation from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction, but translocation was only transient and not detectable after (10 min) of stimulation of PAR1 expressing cells. In contrast, the cells expressing PAR2 showed not only rapid (1 min) redistribution of PKCα to the membrane but also sustained recruitment (10 min) after ternary complex signaling. Fig. 5C summarizes densitometric quantitation of repeat experiments, documenting that the prolonged PAR2-dependent translocation of PKCα was highly reproducible. PMA stimulation triggers TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation even in the absence of PAR2. PMA stimulation of either untransduced (not shown) or PAR2-transduced endothelial cells also resulted in prolonged PKCα translocation (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that the duration of PKCα activity at the membrane is an important determinant for TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation. A critical question, therefore, is how PAR2 signaling differs from PAR1 activation to induce sustained PKCα translocation. G protein-coupled receptor activation induces phosphatidylinositol (PI) breakdown mediated by PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC) isoforms to generate diacylglycerol required for PKC membrane recruitment. However, diacylglycerol is also generated by phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC (PC-PLC), which is known to promote prolonged membrane recruitment of PKCs (32Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of PI- and PC-PLC in PKCα activation downstream of PAR2, the effect of PLC isoform specific inhibitors on TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation was analyzed. Whereas the PI-PLC specific inhibitor U73122 was without effect, the PC-PLC-specific inhibitor tricyclodecanoyl xanthogenate (D609) dose-dependently inhibited ternary complex- or PAR2 agonist-induced TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation (Fig. 5D and data not shown). To further provide evidence that D609 inhibits the pathway downstream of PAR2 leading to PKC activation, we tested the effect of D609 on TF phosphorylation by PMA, which directly activates PKC. Both D609 and U73122 only marginally reduced PMA-induced TF phosphorylation, demonstrating that pathways downstream of PKC are not influenced by D609. The effect of PLC isoform-specific inhibitors on PKCα translocation was analyzed to clarify PAR2-mediated PKCα activation. In PAR2 expressing cells, the PC-PLC-specific inhibitor D609 significantly inhibited both initial and sustained PKCα membrane recruitment in response to TF ternary complex signaling. U73122 produced little to no effect on PKCα translocation in PAR2 expressing cells (Fig. 5E). Based on densitometry of three repeat experiments, D609 reduced PKCα translocation at 1 and 10 min by 76 and 77%, whereas the reduction by U73122 was 27 and 22%, respectively. In contrast, TF-dependent PAR1 activation resulted in transient PKCα translocation that was entirely dependent on PI-PLC. Thus, sustained activation of PKCα and TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation are predominantly dependent on a PC-PLC pathway downstream of PAR2 signaling. In this study, we show that PAR2 signaling specifically targets the TF cytoplasmic domain by inducing TF phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that the ternary TF-VIIa-Xa complex similarly activates PAR1 or PAR2, based on efficiency of PAR internalization and ERK phosphorylation, but only PAR2 signaling leads to TF phosphorylation. TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation is dependent on PKCα activation. The presented mutational data support the concept that phosphorylation of the PKC consensus Ser253 is necessary for subsequent Ser258 phosphorylation, which is recognized by the phosphorylation-specific antibody to TF (22Dorfleutner A. Ruf W. Blood. 2003; 102: 3998-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Rapid PKCα membrane recruitment downstream of PAR1 or PAR2 demonstrates efficient receptor activation by the ternary complex. However, only PAR2 signaling induced sustained PKCα membrane localization, which coincides with the somewhat delayed kinetics of TF phosphorylation. Pharmacological blockade shows that PAR1 and PAR2 activations recruit PKCα through distinct PLC pathways. Sustained activation of PKCα downstream of PAR2 is dependent on PC-PLC, which is known to induce prolonged membrane translocation of PKCs (32Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The fact that PMA stimulation, independent of PAR2, induces both TF phosphorylation and sustained PKCα membrane recruitment provides further support for an essential role of prolonged PKCα signaling in TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation. This study adds to emerging evidence (10Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 12Klarenbach S.W. Chipiuk A.

Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that PAR1 and PAR2 signaling elicit specific and only partially overlapping responses in endothelial cells. More importantly, only TF-dependent signaling, but not the signaling by other coagulation factors, induced cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of the TF cytoplasmic domain thus represents a marker for upstream coagulation signaling through PAR2. Both PAR2 and TF are induced by inflammatory mediators in endothelial cells in tissue culture (33Nawroth P.P. Handley D.A. Esmon C.T. Stern D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3460-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 34Nystedt S. Ramakrishnan V. Sundelin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14910-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and TF has been detected in vivo in splenic endothelial cells in severe systemic inflammation (35Drake T.A. Cheng J. Chang A. Taylor Jr., F.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1458-1470PubMed Google Scholar) or in breast cancer-associated endothelium (36Contrino J. Hair G. Kreutzer D.L. Rickles F.R. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Moreover, PAR2 is found to be up-regulated upon differentiation of monocytes into macrophages (37Colognato R. Slupsky J.R. Jendrach M. Burysek L. Syrovets T. Simmet T. Blood. 2003; 102: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which also express TF. Thus, PAR2-dependent phosphorylation of TF may play regulatory roles in the biology and pathology of vascular cell types that co-express TF and PAR2. The role of the TF cytoplasmic domain has previously been analyzed in heterologous transfection systems. Deletion of the entire cytoplasmic domain has little influence on the procoagulant function of TF (27Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1372-1378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wolberg A.S. Kon R.H. Monroe D.M. Ezban M. Roberts H.R. Hoffman M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although the relevant PARs that transmit TF-dependent signaling in these cell models are incompletely defined, these studies are consistent with an interpretation that the TF cytoplasmic domain is not required for PAR activation. Our data show that TF ternary complex signaling in the case of both PAR1 and PAR2 signaling is rapid, leading to PKCα membrane recruitment within 1 min. However, TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation is a delayed response, and it is therefore not surprising that the TF cytoplasmic domain played apparently no role in early responses of TF-VIIa signaling. In addition, TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation appears to be more efficient by ternary TF-VIIa-Xa in comparison with TF-VIIa stimulation, at least under our experimental conditions, which may indicate that the TF cytoplasmic domain plays a regulatory role in signaling associated with activation of the coagulation pathways.

These pathways promote cell motility, a cellular function that is possibly supported by PAR2 signaling. PAR2 signaling that targets the TF cytoplasmic domain may operate in this context, and the presented data provide novel insight into the mechanism by which PAR2 signaling feeds back onto the protease-binding receptor TF that supports PAR cleavage by associated proteases. Phosphorylation of the TF cytoplasmic domain may influence the recruitment of adaptors and thus integrate and regulate nonhemostatic roles of TF in cell migration, angiogenesis, and inflammation.

We generated stable RNA interference-mediated PEN-2 knockdown cells to probe mutant PEN-2 variants for functional activity. Knockdown of PEN-2 was associated with impaired NCT maturation and deficient PS1 endoproteolysis, which was efficiently rescued by wild type or N-terminally tagged PEN-2 but not by C-terminally tagged PEN-2 or by the C-terminally truncated PEN-2-ΔC mutant. Although the latter mutants rescued the PS1 holoprotein accumulation associated with the PEN-2 knockdown, they failed to restore normal levels of the PS1 N- and C-terminal fragments and to maturate NCT. PEN-2-ΔC was highly unstable and rapidly turned over by proteasomal degradation consistent with its failure to become stably incorporated into the γ-secretase complex. In addition, expression of PEN-2-ΔC caused a selective instability of the PS1 N-/C-terminal fragment heterodimer that underwent proteasomal degradation, whereas NCT and APH-1 were stable. Interestingly, when we knocked down PEN-2 in the background of the endoproteolysis-deficient PS1 Δexon9 mutant, immature NCT still accumulated, demonstrating that PEN-2 is also required for γ-secretase complex maturation when PS endoproteolysis cannot occur. Taken together, our data suggest that PEN-2 is required for the stabilization of the PS fragment heterodimer within the γ-secretase complex following PS endoproteolysis. This function critically depends on the PEN-2 C terminus. Moreover, our data show that PEN-2 is generally required for γ-secretase complex maturation independent of its activity in PS1 endoproteolysis. γ-Secretase is a protease complex composed of presenilin (PS), nicastrin (NCT), APH-1, and PEN-2, which catalyzes intramembrane cleavage of several type I transmembrane proteins including the Alzheimer's disease-associated β-amyloid precursor protein.

Protein Analysis—Membrane fractions of HEK 293 cells were obtained by ultracentrifugation of postnuclear supernatant fractions from cell homogenates that were prepared as described (43Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). For direct immunoblot analysis, membrane fractions were solubilized with STEN-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors (Sigma)). After a clarifying spin, lysates were analyzed for PEN-2 by immunoblotting with antibody 1638, for PS1 by immunoblotting with antibodies PS1N or 3027, for NCT with antibody N1660, for APH-1aL by immunoblotting with antibody 433 or 434, and for APP and APP CTFs by immunoblotting with antibody 6687. For coimmunoprecipitation analysis, membrane fractions were solubilized in CHAPSO-lysis buffer (1% CHAPSO, 150 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, protease inhibitors (Sigma)), subjected to a clarifying spin by ultracentrifugation, and incubated with preimmune serum, N1660 or 2953 antibody, and protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Following two washes with CHAPSO-wash buffer (0.5% CHAPSO, 150 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4), the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis as above. In order to identify functional domains of PEN-2 required for γ-secretase complex formation, maturation, and activity, we generated a HEK 293 cell line stably overexpressing Swedish mutant APP (HEK 293/sw) in which PEN-2 expression is stably knocked down by RNAi (Fig. 1A). This PEN-2 knockdown cell line was stably transfected with cDNA constructs encoding RNAi-resistant wt and mutant PEN-2 variants to assess their capability to rescue PEN-2 deficiency. We first transfected the PEN-2 knockdown cells with cDNA constructs encoding untagged wt PEN-2 and N-terminal hexahistidine-Xpress (H6X) epitope-tagged and C-terminal myc-hexahistidine (mH6) epitope-tagged wt PEN-2. All three proteins were stably expressed at robust levels, and as expected, the tagged PEN-2 variants migrated at higher molecular weight than untagged PEN-2 (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous results (6Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M. Maxwell M. Hai B. Ellis M.C. Parks A.L. Xu W. Li J. Gurney M. Myers R.L. Himes C.S.

APP CTFs also accumulated when PEN-2-mH6 was expressed indicating that the authentic C terminus of PEN-2 is critical for γ-secretase activity. We next sought to investigate why expression of PEN-2-mH6 caused a defect in γ-secretase activity, and we asked whether a defect in γ-secretase complex maturation was responsible for the observed loss of γ-secretase function. To confirm further the functional importance of the PEN-2 C terminus, we also constructed a PEN-2 variant with a C-terminal truncation of 17 amino acids (PEN-2-ΔC), and we expressed it stably in the PEN-2 knockdown cells (Fig. 1C). We first investigated the maturation of PS. Consistent with previous results (11Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol.

Expression of untagged PEN-2 allowed efficient recovery of PS1 holoprotein endoproteolysis (Fig. 1D). In contrast, expression of PEN-2-mH6 and of PEN-2-ΔC caused an intriguing, unexpected biochemical phenotype. Although the PS1 holoprotein did not accumulate anymore, the levels of the PS1 NTF and CTF were strongly reduced similar to those observed in the PEN-2 knockdown cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, although the PEN-2 C terminus appears to be dispensable for PS1 endoproteolysis, it is required for the maintenance of normal levels of the PS fragments. As reported previously (11Steiner H.

Interestingly, the levels of APH-1aL were largely unaffected by the knockdown of PEN-2 (Fig. 1E). Neither PEN-2-mH6 nor PEN-2-ΔC rescued the maturation defect of NCT (Fig. 1D). Consequently, as observed for PEN-2-mH6 (Fig. 1B), expression of PEN-2-ΔC was associated with impaired γ-secretase activity as judged from the accumulation of APP CTFs (Fig. 1F). Thus, either addition of an epitope tag to the C terminus or a large deletion of it abrogated PEN-2 function in γ-secretase complex formation, stability, maturation, and activity. Taken together, these data suggest that the C terminus is a functionally important domain of PEN-2 required for the stabilization of PS fragments. We next asked why the C-terminal PEN-2 variants failed to stabilize PS1 fragments. To address this question we sought to investigate the stability of PEN-2-ΔC and treated cells with cycloheximide to block de novo protein synthesis. We first investigated the stability of the γ-secretase complex components in control and PEN-2 knockdown cells. As expected, endogenous PEN-2, PS1 fragments, NCT, and APH-1aL were stable in control cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, residual endogenous PEN-2 in the knockdown cells was stable as were the PS1 holoprotein, NCT, and APH-1aL in these cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with previous results (17Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the stability of PEN-2 or PEN-2-ΔC expressed in the background of PEN-2 knockdown cells. wt PEN-2 occurred as a stable protein (Fig. 2B). In contrast, cycloheximide treatment revealed that PEN-2-ΔC was highly unstable and almost completely turned over within 3 h (Fig. 2B). We next investigated the stability of PS1, NCT, and APH-1aL in the background of wt PEN-2 and PEN-2-ΔC expression. The PS1 fragments, NCT and APH-1aL, were stable in the PEN-2 knockdown cells stably expressing wt PEN-2. In contrast, in the PEN-2-ΔC-expressing knockdown cells, the already low levels of PS1 fragments dropped further during the time course of the cycloheximide treatment. This indicates that the PS1 fragments were not stabilized and thus turned over (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, immature NCT and APH-1aL as well as the low levels of residual mature NCT (because of the incomplete PEN-2 knockdown) remained stable (Fig. 2B), consistent with the observation that these two proteins can independently stabilize each other (13Gu Y.

During the self-incompatibility response of Papaver rhoeas L. (field poppy) pollen, the actin filament network is rapidly depolymerized by a flood of cytosolic free Ca2+ that results in cessation of tip growth and prevention of fertilization. Attempts to model this dramatic cytoskeletal response with known pollen actin-binding proteins (ABPs) revealed that the major G-actin-binding protein profilin can account for only a small percentage of the measured depolymerization. We have identified an 80-kDa, Ca2+-regulated ABP from poppy pollen (PrABP80) and characterized its biochemical properties in vitro. Sequence determination by mass spectrometry revealed that PrABP80 is related to gelsolin and villin. The molecular weight, lack of filament cross-linking activity, and a potent severing activity are all consistent with PrABP80 being a plant gelsolin. Kinetic analysis of actin assembly/disassembly reactions revealed that substoichiometric amounts of PrABP80 can nucleate actin polymerization from monomers, block the assembly of profilin-actin complex onto actin filament ends, and enhance profilin-mediated actin depolymerization. Fluorescence microscopy of individual actin filaments provided compelling, direct evidence for filament severing and confirmed the actin nucleation and barbed end capping properties. This is the first direct evidence for a plant gelsolin and the first example of efficient severing by a plant ABP. We propose that PrABP80 functions at the center of the self-incompatibility response by creating new filament pointed ends for disassembly and by blocking barbed ends from profilin-actin assembly.

The plant cytoskeleton comprises a dynamic network of actin filaments, microtubules, and accessory proteins that powers cytoplasmic streaming, prevents fungal attack, patterns the deposition of cellulosic wall polymers, and shapes cellular morphogenesis. Understanding how the cytoskeleton is organized, how it responds to environmental cues, and how its dynamics are regulated are central questions in plant biology. In addition to being essential for sexual reproduction, pollen is an ideal choice of material for studies of the cytoskeleton. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in pollen, representing 5–20% of total cellular protein (1Liu X. Yen L.-F.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal genes are among the most abundantly expressed classes of transcripts in Arabidopsis pollen (3Honys D. Twell D. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 640-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), and several classes of actin-binding protein (ABP) 1The abbreviations used are: ABP, actin-binding protein; CP, capping protein; AtCP, Arabidopsis CP; AtVLN, Arabidopsis villin; DTT, dithiothreitol; G-actin, globular or monomeric actin; F-actin, filamentous actin; MmCP, mouse CP; PrABP80, P. rhoeas 80-kDa ABP; Zm-PRO5, Z. mays profilin; SI, self-incompatibility; VHP, villin headpiece; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; TOF, time-offlight.1The abbreviations used are: ABP, actin-binding protein; CP, capping protein; AtCP, Arabidopsis CP; AtVLN, Arabidopsis villin; DTT, dithiothreitol; G-actin, globular or monomeric actin; F-actin, filamentous actin; MmCP, mouse CP; PrABP80, P. rhoeas 80-kDa ABP; Zm-PRO5, Z. mays profilin; SI, self-incompatibility; VHP, villin headpiece; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; TOF, time-offlight. have been isolated and characterized biochemically (4Yokota E.

Hussey P.J. Hussey P.J. The Plant Cytoskeleton in Cell Differentiation and Development. Blackwell Publishers, UK2004: 32-80Google Scholar). Pollen tube growth is arguably the most dramatic example of cellular morphogenesis in plants (5Vidali L. Hepler P.K. Protoplasma. 2001; 215: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Hepler P.K. Vidali L. Cheung A.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 159-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). A cytoplasmic extension of the vegetative cell, the pollen tube, carries the male gametes through the pistil at growth rates up to 1 cm/h. The tip growth mechanism involves carefully orchestrated delivery of cell wall materials and plasma membrane through the directed trafficking of secretory vesicles. Underlying this cellular expansion is a polar distribution of cytoplasmic organelles, oscillatory gradients of cytosolic ions, and a specific organization of the cytoskeletal machinery. Prominent actin cables support reverse fountain cytoplasmic streaming and are arranged axially throughout much of the cytoplasm. A collar-like zone of fine filament bundles, in the apical 10–15 μm, and a dynamic meshwork of fine actin filaments (F-actin) at the extreme apex are thought to organize vesicle docking and fusion. Although actin filament turnover is essential for pollen tube growth (8Gibbon B.C. Kovar D.R. Staiger C.J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2349-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 9Vidali L. McKenna S.T. Hepler P.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2534-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), exactly how the cytoskeleton functions and what accessory factors modulate these events remain poorly understood. Many plant species utilize genetic mechanisms to prevent inbreeding. The self-incompatibility (SI) response in field poppy (Papaver rhoeas) pollen involves a flood of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) that correlates with the cessation of tip growth (10Franklin-Tong V.E. Ride J.P. Read N.D. Trewavas A.J. Franklin F.C.H. Plant J. 1993; 4: 163-177Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 11Franklin-Tong V.E. Hackett G. Hepler P.K.

Cytological and biochemical studies demonstrate that reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is one of the earliest events triggered by SI (13Geitmann A. Snowman B.N. Emons A.M.C. Franklin-Tong V.E. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1239-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Snowman B.N. Kovar D.R. Shevchenko G. Franklin-Tong V.E. Staiger C.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2613-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Quantitative analyses of F-actin levels reveal a rapid and sustained depolymerization of actin filaments with reductions of 56 and 74% in pollen grains and pollen tubes, respectively (14Snowman B.N. Kovar D.R. Shevchenko G. Franklin-Tong V.E. Staiger C.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2613-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because actin depolymerization is mimicked by treatments with calcium ionophores, attempts to model the response in vitro with known calcium-sensitive ABPs were made. Pollen profilin binds to monomeric (G-) actin with a modest affinity and has increased G-actin sequestering activity in the presence of micromolar Ca2+ (14Snowman B.N. Kovar D.R. Shevchenko G. Franklin-Tong V.E. Staiger C.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2613-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Kovar D.R. Drøbak B.K. Staiger C.J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For native poppy profilin, however, the cellular concentration and apparent Kd at physiologically relevant [Ca2+] are inconsistent with it functioning alone to mediate the depolymerization of actin. It was proposed that profilin acts in cooperation with other, yet to be discovered, ABPs to effect the destruction of actin networks during SI (14Snowman B.N. Kovar D.R. Shevchenko G. Franklin-Tong V.E. Staiger C.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2613-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Profilin acts like a simple sequestering protein in the presence of capping factors that block the barbed ends of filaments (16Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 17Perelroizen I. Didry D. Christensen H. Chua N.-H. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol.

The first example of this activity, associated with a heterodimeric capping protein from Arabidopsis (AtCP), has been reported recently (19Huang S. Blanchoin L. Kovar D.R. Staiger C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44832-44842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Alternatively, proteins that sever actin filaments could enhance profilin-mediated actin depolymerization. Indirect evidence for weak severing activity by ADF/cofilin makes this a potential candidate for SI, but other examples of efficient actin filament-severing proteins from plants are lacking (6Staiger C.J. Hussey P.J. Hussey P.J. The Plant Cytoskeleton in Cell Differentiation and Development. Blackwell Publishers, UK2004: 32-80Google Scholar). Gelsolin, villin, and CapG comprise a family of related calcium-regulated ABPs that are found in many vertebrate and lower eukaryotic cells (20Friederich E. Louvard D. Kries T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 175-179Google Scholar, 21Yin H.L. Kreis T. Vale R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Gelsolin is composed of six conserved 125–150-amino-acid gelsolin homology domains, designated G1–G6, and has Ca2+-stimulated F-actin severing activity. Gelsolin also caps the barbed ends of actin filaments and nucleates formation of new filaments. Crystal structures for one or more of these gelsolin subdomains, coupled with spectroscopy and cryoelectron microscopy studies, have provided substantial insight about the molecular mechanisms of filament severing and capping (23McGough A.M. Staiger C.J. Min J.-K. Simonetti K.D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Villin has a core of six gelsolin subdomains but also contains an additional C-terminal actin-binding module called the villin headpiece (VHP) that allows it to make contact with two adjacent filaments and to cross-link filaments into bundles. In the presence of micromolar Ca2+ some, but not all, villins sever actin filaments and cap filament barbed ends (24Glenney Jr., J.R. Bretscher A. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S.

Two actin-bundling proteins from lily pollen, 135-ABP and 115-ABP, are known (26Yokota E. Vidali L. Tominaga M. Tahara H. Orii H. Morizane Y. Hepler P.K. Shimmen T.

Although lily villins bundle filaments in a Ca2+-/calmodulin-dependent manner, they do not have severing or capping activity (30Yokota E. Muto S. Shimmen T.

A preliminary analysis of recombinant AtVLN1 demonstrates high affinity binding to F-actin and bundle formation but no severing or capping. 2S. Huang, L. Blanchoin, T. Matsumoto, R. Robinson, and C. J. Staiger, unpublished data.2S. Huang, L. Blanchoin, T. Matsumoto, R. Robinson, and C. J. Staiger, unpublished data. Using affinity chromatography on DNase I-Sepharose, we identified an 80-kDa ABP from poppy pollen that is an efficient nucleator of actin filaments, has potent Ca2+-stimulated severing activity, and regulates assembly by binding to filament barbed ends. De novo sequence determination by mass spectrometry indicates that ABP80 is related to gelsolin. This is the first direct evidence for a plant gelsolin and the first example of efficient actin filament-severing activity by a plant ABP. Protein Purification—Approximately 5 g of pollen from field poppy (P. rhoeas L.) was hydrated at 37 °C for 30 min. Pollen was ground in a cooled mortar along with 1 g of fine sand (Sigma S-9887) in extraction buffer (1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.6 m KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (34Schafer D.A.

The sonicate was clarified with three consecutive centrifugations of 30,000, 46,000, and 130,000 × g. The supernatant was passed through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and loaded onto a DNase I-Sepharose column (34Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. Cell Motil.

Pooled protein fractions were dialyzed against Solution A (10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% NaN3, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1:200 protease inhibitors). The dialyzed protein was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with Solution A, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (10–500 mm). The purified PrABP80 was dialyzed against Buffer G (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.01% NaN3, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm DTT), aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The protein was further clarified by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h before use. Protein concentration was determined with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. PrABP80 from Q-Sepharose was probed with affinity-purified Arabidopsis VILLIN1 (AtVLN1) antibody at 1:100 dilution and developed as described previously (35Karakesisoglou I. Schleicher M. Gibbon B.C. Staiger C.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For production of recombinant AtVLN1, the first three gelsolin domains (G1–G3) of AtVLN1 (33Klahre U. Friederich E. Kost B. Louvard D. Chua N.-H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-KG for the generation of a GST-VLN1(G1–G3) fusion protein. Alternatively, PrABP80 was probed with lily villin, 135-ABP serum kindly provided by T. Shimmen, Himeji Institute of Technology (28Yokota E. Takahara K.-i. Shimmen T. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was purified from bacterial cells, and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) moiety was removed, according to the methods of Kovar et al. (36Kovar D.R. Staiger C.J. Weaver E.A. McCurdy D.W. Plant J. 2000; 24: 625-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder and purified by Sephacryl S-300 chromatography (37Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Actin was labeled on Cys-374 with pyrene iodoacetamide (37Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mouse capping protein (MmCP; α1β2 heterodimer) was kindly provided by D. R. Kovar (Yale University). Zea mays profilin (ZmPRO5) and AtCP were purified as described previously (15Kovar D.R. Drøbak B.K. Staiger C.J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Huang S. Blanchoin L. Kovar D.R. Staiger C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44832-44842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Human plasma gelsolin was expressed from a plasmid kindly provided by T. Pollard (Yale University) and purified from bacterial cells roughly according to Pope et al. (38Pope B. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15848-15855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with DEAE-Sepharose and Cibacron Blue 3G-A chromatography. Mass Spectrometry—For identification of PrABP80 by mass spectrometry, appropriate bands were excised from Coomassie-stained gels. The gel pieces were destained with 50% NH4HCO3, 50% CH3CN. Supernatant was removed, and the gel pieces were dried under vacuum for 30 min. Gel pieces were reduced with 10 mm DTT in 100 mm NH4HCO3 at 56 °C for 45 min. Supernatant was removed and replaced with 55 mm C2H4INO for 30 min in the dark. Supernatant was removed again and replaced with 100 mm NH4HCO3 for 5 min and then diluted to 50% (v/v) CH3CN for 15 min. Gel pieces were dried under vacuum for 30 min and digested with 0.01 mg/ml bovine pancreas trypsin (Sigma T-8658) for 45 min on ice. After removing the solution, gel pieces were incubated in digestion buffer (25 mm NH4HCO3;5mm CaCl2) for 16 h. The digestion buffer was removed and saved, whereas the gel pieces were extracted with 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 15 min and then diluted to 50% (v/v) CH3CN for an additional 15 min. This was followed by extraction with 5% CH2O2 for 15 min and then diluted to 50% (v/v) CH3CN for an additional 15 min. This extraction step was repeated once. The washes were pooled with the digestion buffer. DTT was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the peptides were dried under vacuum. The peptides were resuspended in 20% C2HF3O2, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Poros Cleanup—An aliquot of the tryptic peptides was desalted in a glass purification capillary (Protana Engineering) using a 20-μm Poros R2 (polystyrene divinylbenzene; Applied Biosystems, Inc. (ABI), Foster City, CA). Briefly, the peptide mixture was loaded onto the R2 resin, washed three times with ∼7 μl of 95:5, H2O:ACN, 0.5% formic acid, and eluted with ∼1.5 μl of 30:70, H2O:ACN, 0.5% formic acid into a coated nanoelectrospray capillary (Protana). Data Acquisition Parameters—Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were acquired using a QSTAR Pulsar i (ABI) quadrupole-TOF (time-of-flight) mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-ESI source (Protana). The ESI voltage was 1000 V, the TOF region acceleration voltage was 4 kV, and the injection pulse repetition rate was 6.0 kHz. External calibration was performed using porcine renin substrate decapeptide (Sigma), which yields doubly and triply charged monoisotopic signals (879.9705 and 586.9830, respectively). Mass spectra were acquired in an automated data-dependent mode (information-dependent acquisition) in positive mode over 25 min. De novo sequencing was performed with BioAnalyst software (ABI), and MS BLAST searches were performed at www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de. High Speed and Low Speed Co-sedimentation Assays—High and low speed co-sedimentation assays were used to examine the actin-binding and actin-cross-linking properties of PrABP80, respectively (36Kovar D.R. Staiger C.J. Weaver E.A. McCurdy D.W. Plant J. 2000; 24: 625-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a 100-μl reaction volume, 2.0 μm G-actin alone, 200 nm PrABP80 alone, or G-actin with PrABP80 were incubated in 1× F-buffer (10× stock: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm ATP, 1 m KCl, 50 mm MgCl2). These reactions were performed in the presence of 200 μm Ca2+ or 5 mm EGTA to give free Ca2+ of 180 μm and 15 nm, respectively. Free Ca2+ in the presence of EGTA was calculated with “EGTA” software by Petesmif (P. M. Smith, University of Liverpool, Liverpool UK), available at www.liv.ac.uk/~petesmif/software/egta.htm. After a 90-min incubation at 22 °C, samples were centrifuged at either 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °Cor 13,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of pellet and supernatant samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Actin Nucleation Assay—Actin nucleation was carried out essentially as described by Schafer et al. (39Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Monomeric actin at 2 μm (5% pyrene-labeled) was incubated with PrABP80 or AtCP for 5 min in Buffer G. Fluorescence of pyrene-actin was monitored with a PTI Alphascan spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ) after the addition of 1/10 volume of 10× KMEI (1× contains 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0). The number of ends (n) generated during the nucleation reaction was calculated from the slope of the polymerization curves at half-polymerization according to Equation 1,Slope=k+(A)(n)−k−(n)(Eq. 1) where k+ is the association rate constant at the pointed ends (1.3 μm-1 s-1) (40Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), k- is the dissociation rate constant (0.8 s-1), and (A) is the concentration of actin monomers. These experiments were performed at 87 nm free Ca2+, buffered with 1 mm EGTA, to minimize the effect of filament severing on the initial growth rates. Elongation Assay to Determine the Affinity of PrABP80 for Actin Filaments—Various concentrations of PrABP80 or AtCP were incubated with 0.4 μm preformed actin filaments in KMI (50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 3 mm NaN3 and 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was supplemented with 1 μm G-actin (5% pyrene-labeled) saturated by 4 μm human profilin 1 to initiate actin elongation at barbed ends, and the final free [Ca2+] was 160 μm. The affinity of PrABP80 or AtCP for the barbed ends of actin filaments was determined by the variation of the initial rate of elongation as a function of the concentration of PrABP80 or AtCP using Equation 2Vi=Vif+(Vib−Vif)((Kd+[ends]+[CP]−(Kd+[ends]+[CP])2−(4[ends][CP])2[ends])(Eq. 2) where Vi is the observed rate of elongation, Vif is the rate of elongation when all barbed ends are free, Vib is the rate of elongation when all barbed ends are capped, [ends] is the concentration of barbed ends, and [CP] is the concentration of capping protein or PrABP80. To test the effects of [Ca2+] on the affinity of PrABP80 for filament barbed ends, similar reactions were performed in the presence of 5 mm EGTA to give free [Ca2+] of 10 nm, 100 nm, 1 μm, and 10 μm. The data were modeled with Kaleidagraph v3.6 software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Dynamics of Actin Filament Depolymerization—F-actin at 2.5 μm (40–50% pyrene-labeled) was depolymerized by the addition of an equimolar amount of ZmPRO5, in the presence or absence of PrABP80 or MmCP. The decrease in pyrene fluorescence accompanying actin depolymerization was monitored for 30 min after the addition of profilin. The final free [Ca2+] was 1 μm for most reactions. To test the requirement of Ca2+ for PrABP80-mediated depolymerization, free Ca2+ was reduced to 15 nm with 5 mm EGTA. Fluorescence Microscopy of Actin Filaments—Individual actin filaments labeled with fluorescent phalloidin were imaged by fluorescence microscopy according to Blanchoin et al. (41Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Mullins R.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1273-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 42Blanchoin L. Amann K.J. Higgs H.N. Marchand J.-B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). To visualize actin filaments generated during nucleation, actin at 4 μm alone or together with PrABP80 were polymerized in 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 3 mm NaN3, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, at 25 °C for 30 min and labeled with an equimolar amount of rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma) during polymerization. For these nucleation experiments, the free [Ca2+] was 87 nm. In other experiments, PrABP80 or AtCP were incubated, in the presence of 160 μm or 14.7 nm free Ca2+, with prepolymerized rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled F-actin. The polymerized F-actin was diluted to 10 nm in fluorescence buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml glucose oxidase, 15 mg/ml glucose, 20 μg/ml catalase, 0.5% methylcellulose. A dilute sample of 3 μl was applied to a 22 × 22 mm coverslip coated with poly-l-lysine (0.01%). Actin filaments were observed by epi-fluorescence illumination under a Nikon Microphot SA microscope equipped with a 60×, 1.4 NA Planapo objective, and digital images were collected with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER 12-bit CCD camera using Metamorph 6.0 software. In the elongation assay, actin filaments stabilized by rhodaminephalloidin were elongated by actin monomers in presence of Alexa-488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) to stabilize the new filaments. Polymerization conditions were as given above for assembly from monomers, and the final free [Ca2+] was 76 nm. Purification of an 80-kDa P. rhoeas Actin-binding Protein (PrABP80)—To better understand the Ca2+-mediated depolymerization of actin filaments in pollen, several independent approaches for the identification of ABPs are being pursued. During the purification of native actin from poppy pollen (14Snowman B.N. Kovar D.R. Shevchenko G. Franklin-Tong V.E. Staiger C.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2613-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we observed an ∼80-kDa protein that bound to DNase I columns in the presence of 1 m salt. Because ABPs such as gelsolin, villin, and ADF form high affinity complexes with G-actin and are retained on DNase I-Sepharose columns (43Bretscher A. Weber K.

Hydrated poppy pollen was homogenized and clarified by differential centrifugation. The high speed supernatant (Fig. 1A, lane 1) was loaded onto DNase I-Sepharose, and most of the p"

Substrates for degradation are recognized by the E1, E2, and E3 ubiquitin conjugation machinery and tagged with polyubiquitin chains, which are thought to promote the proteolytic process through their binding with the proteasome. We describe a method to bypass the ubiquitination step artificially both in vivo and in a purified in vitro system. Seven proteasome subunits were tagged with Fpr1, and fusion reporter constructs were created with the Fpr1-rapamycin binding domain of Tor1. Reporter proteins were localized to the proteasome by the addition of rapamycin, a drug that heterodimerizes Fpr1 and Tor1. Degradation of reporter proteins was observed with proteasomes that had either Rpn10 or Pre10 subunits tagged with Fpr1. Our experiments resolved a simple but central problem concerning the design of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We conclude that localization to the proteasome is sufficient for degradation and, therefore, any added functions polyubiquitin chains possess beyond tethering substrates to the proteasome are not strictly necessary for proteolysis.

ATP-dependent protease complexes degrade the majority of unstable cellular proteins, a process that is conserved across all three kingdoms of life. These molecular machines function both generally in protein turnover and specifically in the regulation of processes such as transcription, apoptosis, antigen presentation, and cell cycle progression (1Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A high degree of conservation is evident among them; the archaebacterial and eukaryotic 20S proteolytic core particles share both sequence and structural homology (2Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), whereas eubacteria have functionally related complexes: ClpYQ, ClpXP, and ClpAP (3Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 4Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Access to the proteolytic central chamber is obstructed at both ends of the cylindrical assembly by N-terminal projections of the α-subunits, thus preventing uncontrolled proteolytic degradation (5Groll M.

Eukaryotes have evolved an elaborate system that operates in conjunction with the proteasome to facilitate the temporal and specific regulation of intracellular proteolysis. Most proteins are targeted for degradation through ubiquitination, mediated by the E1, E2, E3 ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation machinery. These three consecutively acting enzymes are necessary for target recognition, transfer of a ubiquitin moiety to the substrate, and subsequent elongation of the ubiquitin branched chain (8Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Modularity and the large number of E2 Ub-conjugating enzymes and E3 Ub ligases allow for greater specificity and flexibility in recognizing a diverse range of substrates. Once a protein is polyubiquitinated, it is targeted to and degraded by the 26S proteasome. The polyubiquitin chain is thought to play two possible roles. The first is to target the protein to the proteasome; the second is to initiate the process of degradation. The targeting hypothesis is supported by the identification of several proteasome subunits that either bind or crosslink to ubiquitin chains (9Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Hypotheses for how ubiquitin-dependent initiation of degradation might occur include allosteric regulation, channel opening, and assistance in the unfolding of the target (11Groll M. Huber R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, little data have been reported to support these ideas. The elucidation of the mechanism for proteolysis of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) established that polyubiquitination is not necessary for proteasome-mediated degradation (12Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). ODC is an enzyme whose degradation is mediated by its binding to the cofactor antizyme 1 (AZ1). Once bound, ODC-AZ1 can be recognized by the proteasome, and ODC is degraded in an ubiquitin-independent manner. However, it is unclear whether the means by which AZ1 promotes degradation differs fundamentally from that of polyubiquitin chains. A recent study demonstrated that ODC-AZ1 competes with substrate-linked and free polyubiquitin chains for the occupancy of the same binding site on the proteasome (13Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism for the degradation of ODC seems to represent a specialized evolutionary adaptation that closely mimics ubiquitination. The binding of ubiquitin-conjugated substrates (or ODCAZ1) to the proteasome may itself serve as the activation step in proteolytic degradation. We hypothesize that such an activation step is not necessary, that localization to the proteasome can be sufficient for degradation. In this study, we support this hypothesis by demonstrating proteasome-mediated degradation both in vivo and in a purified in vitro system, while artificially bypassing the need for ubiquitin-dependence. Construction of Parental Strain DY001—All experiments were performed in derivatives of strain DY001 to ensure that the components of the heterodimerization system would minimally interact with endogenous proteins, thus preventing cell cycle arrest and mislocalization of the reporter upon the addition of rapamycin (14Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). The Fpr1-rapamycin binding domain (nucleotides 5656-6243) of the dominant allele TOR1-2 was amplified from strain JHY17-9C (15Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27531-27537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the integrating plasmid pRS306 (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This vector was then digested with HindIII to cut once within TOR1-2 and transformed into the strain BY4742 Δfpr1::kanr (Research Genetics). Integration and subsequent loop-out was selected for on the appropriate plates. The correct strain was verified by PCR and sequencing. Genomic Tagging of Proteasome Subunits—Tagging of proteasome subunits was performed both by homologous recombination of linear fragments containing 40 bp of flanking homology to the target site and by two-step integration with a non-replicating plasmid. FPR1 was amplified by PCR from the strain FY4 (17Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the plasmid pUG-spHIS5 (18Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tag, forming FPR1-HA-pUG-spHIS5. Integration primer pairs were designed for tagging each of four proteasome subunits (PRE10, RPN2, RPN6, RPN11). For each pair, one primer contained 40 bp of genomic homology to the 3′ end of the proteasome subunit, excluding the stop codon, and 20 bp of homology to the 5′ end of FPR1 on pUG-spHIS5, excluding ATG. The second primer contained 40 bp of genomic homology ∼50 bp downstream of the proteasome subunit gene stop codon and 20 bp of homology to pUG-spHIS5 immediately downstream of the spHIS5 marker flanked by loxP sites. Two confirmatory primers were also designed that flanked the integration site of each proteasome subunit. Strain DY001 was transformed with pSH47, a plasmid with a galactose-inducible cre gene and a URA3 selection marker (19Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). A 2-kb linear fragment from FPR1-HA-pUG-spHIS5 was amplified using each integration primer pair to generate linear 2-kb fragments suitable for genomic integration. 15 μg of each fragment was transformed into DY001 carrying pSH47, and selection was performed on SC-URA-HIS. Colonies were then picked and streaked onto SC-URA GAL to induce cre and to select for the loopout of the spHIS5 marker. Colonies were finally streaked onto a 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing plate to remove pSH47. All tagged subunits were verified by sequencing. Approximately 400-500 bp of the carboxyl-terminal end (without the stop codon) and 3′ untranslated region of proteasome subunits RPT2, RPT5, and RPN10 were amplified from strain FY4. Each pair was subcloned into the integration plasmid pRS306 (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) along with FPR1 so that the final structure at the cloning site was 5′-proteasome subunit C-term-FPR1-proteasome subunit UTR. Each derivative of pRS306 was cut at a unique site within the carboxy terminus of the proteasome subunit and transformed into DY001. Selection for integration was done on SC-URA; loopout of the marker was on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing plates. All tagged subunits were verified by sequencing. Δpdr5 strains were generated by recombination of a URA3 marker flanked by 40 bp homologous to sequence immediately 5′ and 3′ to genomic PDR5. Preparation of Reporter Plasmids—All versions of the reporters were derivatives of the vector pRS415 (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TOR1(S1972R) is an allele of TOR1 that has a severely impaired binding affinity to FPR1-rapamycin (14Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). The sequence corresponding to amino acids 1883-2078 for both Tor1 and Tor1(S1972R) were amplified and inserted into the vector pRS415 along with HIS3 amplified from strain FY4. HA-tagged versions of the reporters had the hemagglutinin epitope-fused C-terminal to His3. Screen and Western Assays—In both assays, rapamycin was added to a final concentration of 1 μm, cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 30 ng/ml, and PS-341 was added to a final concentration of 200 μm. For liquid cultures, samples were extracted at fixed time intervals (0, 30, 60, 90 min) and whole-cell extracts were made. 25 μgof total protein was used from each sample, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 10% powdered nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline plus Tween overnight at 4 °C and incubated with anti-HA (3F10) primary antibody (Roche Applied Science) and then HP-conjugated antirat secondary antibody. Visualization was done using Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting system. Purification of the Proteasome—26S proteasomes were affinity-purified from strains Pre10-FPR1 and Rpn10 FPR1 using the Rpn11-TEV-ProA tag described previously (20Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in YPD, harvested, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and lysed by French press. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 25 min, filtered, and incubated with IgG resin (ICN) for 1 h at 4 °C. Resin was collected in a column, washed with 100 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer and equilibrated with TEV-protease buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Elution was performed by incubating the resin in 1.5 bed volumes of TEV-protease buffer containing 50 units of His6-TEV-protease per ml of resin, at 30 °C for 1 h. One single homogeneous fraction was collected and aliquoted for each prep. The integrity of the 26S complexes and the presence of Pre10-FPR1- and Rpn10-FPR1-tagged subunits was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining, SDS-PAGE, and immunodetection. In Vitro Assay—HA-tagged TOR-HIS3 and TORS1972R-HIS3 were cut out of their respective pRS415 vectors, inserted into PROTet.133, and transformed into DH5αPRO cells (BD Biosciences). A 10-ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of media, which was subsequently grown for 4 h at 37 °C. The fusion protein production was induced with 100 ng/ml of anhydrotetracycline, and the culture was grown for 4 h at 30 °C. Isolation of purified protein was done according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a bead bed volume of 250 μl. 1.5 ml of the eluate was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and concentrated to ∼1 mg/ml. The assays were performed in activity buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm ATP) containing 4 μg of proteasome and 1.6 μg of Tor-His3 or TorS1972R-His3, in an initial volume of 100 μl, at 30 °C. Heterodimerization was induced with 1 μm rapamycin, and proteasome activity was inhibited with 100 μm PS-341. Time course fractions were obtained by extraction of equal volumes from the reaction tub in regular intervals. Full details and all primer and plasmid sequence information can be accessed on the World Wide Web at arep.med.harvard.edu/cKD/default.htm. Chemical inducers of dimerization are a class of reagents that facilitate the regulated association of any two proteins. They have been used in a number of applications such as localization of proteins to subcellular domains, triggering of signal transduction cascades, and control of gene expression (21Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 22Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R.

To test the hypothesis that localization to the proteasome is sufficient for degradation, we modified and utilized such a system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One part of the heterodimerizing pair of modules is fused to the proteasome, whereas the complementary module is fused to the reporter to be tested for degradation. Addition of the chemical dimerizer in an experimental system brings the two modules together, thus localizing the reporter to the site of the proteasome. If degradation occurs as a result of the drug-induced association, it can be monitored with the appropriate assay (Fig. 1a). In S. cerevisiae, the lipophilic macrolide rapamycin has been shown to bind with high affinity to the protein Fpr1, and this complex in turn binds to the ligand-binding domain of Tor1 (Tor11883-2078, or hereafter called Tor) (15Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27531-27537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Seven proteasome subunits (Rpn2, Rpt2, Rpt5, Rpn6 Pre10, Rpn10, Rpn11) that range in distance from the 20S proteolytic core were C-terminally fused with Fpr1 (Fig. 1b). Strains bearing FPR1-tagged Rpt2, Rpn6, and Rpn11 subunits could not be recovered apparently because of their lethality (data not shown). DY001 strains with Rpn2, Rpt5, Pre10, and Rpn10 FPR1-tagged subunits (henceforth referred to as strain subunit-FPR1) were viable and contained correctly integrated fragments, as determined by PCR, and exhibited wild-type expression levels, as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). A Screen for Growth-deficient Phenotypes—A gradient growth assay was used to screen the viable strains containing Fpr1-tagged proteasome subunits for degradation-through-localization (DTL) candidates. The auxotrophic marker HIS3 encodes a protein involved in histidine biosynthesis and is necessary for growth on histidine-dropout media. All of the Fpr1-tagged strains used in this assay have their chromosomal copy of HIS3 deleted and therefore require exogenous expression of functional His3 for growth. Two reporter constructs were designed for use in the screen. The reporter Tor-His3 is an amino-terminal fusion of the heterodimerizing module Tor with full-length His3 (Fig. 1c). The control reporter TorS1972R-His3 replaces wild-type Tor with a missense mutant that has a decreased affinity for the rapamycin-Fpr1 complex (14Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Identification of DTL candidates was based on the comparative growth of strains on histidine-dropout solid media, with or without rapamycin. Fpr1-tagged strains that expressed the control reporter TorS1972R-His3 were not expected to show any difference in growth between the two plates; the fusion protein would not bind rapamycin and, therefore, should not be directed to the proteasome. Tor-His3 binds rapamycin and, therefore, should have an increased association with the proteasome in the presence of the drug. If this association was sufficient for degradation, Tor-His3 containing strains would be expected to display a growth-deficient phenotype on the histidine-dropout plates with rapamycin. The untagged DY001 parental and the four viable Fpr1-tagged strains were individually transformed with the experimental and control reporter constructs. All strains grew equally well on control plates containing histidine (data not shown). Each transformant was then spotted as a 10-fold dilution series (103-105) on two sets of experimental plates: histidine-dropout media either containing or lacking rapamycin (Fig. 2). Strain Rpn10-FPR1 displayed the most striking rapamycin-dependent phenotype. Strain Pre10-FPR1 had a milder growth-deficient phenotype that was still significant and reproducible. Strains Rpn2-FPR1 and Rpt5-FPR1 did not show comparative growth phenotypes consistent with degradation of the reporter constructs. Possible uses for these latter two strains will be addressed under “Discussion.” Western Assays Confirm DTL—The aforementioned growth assay was a convenient tool for isolating strains to test the main hypothesis. However, on its own, the growth assay did not prove that localization was sufficient for degradation because His3 function could have been compromised in a rapamycin-dependent but degradation-independent manner. To address this point, degradation of the reporters was measured directly. Strains Pre10-FPR1 and Rpn10-FPR1 were singly transformed with plasmids that expressed HA epitope-tagged versions of Tor-His3 and TorS1972R-His3. The transformants were grown in liquid culture to early log phase, whereupon cycloheximide was added to halt protein translation. Each culture was then split into two parts, and rapamycin was added to one part. Samples were collected at various times, and whole-cell protein extracts were made and used for Western analysis (Fig. 3, a-e). Consistent with our hypothesis, both strains, Pre10-FPR1 and Rpn10-FPR1, displayed an increase in the rate of degradation of the reporter Tor-His3 when rapamycin was added to the cultures, with half-lives of ∼20-30 min (Fig. 3f). No difference in the rate of degradation was seen with Fpr1-tagged strains expressing the mutant reporter, TorS1972R-His3. To demonstrate that degradation of the reporter was mediated by the proteasome and not processed through other pathways, the experiments were repeated with the addition of the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 (Fig. 3, g and h; Ref. 24Palombella V.J. Conner E.M. Fuseler J.W. Destree A. Davis J.M. Laroux F.S. Wolf R.E. Huang J. Brand S. Elliott P.J. Lazarus D. McCormack T. Parent L. Stein R. Adams J. Grisham M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15671-15676Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). As expected, addition of PS-341 halted degradation of Tor-His3, even in the presence of rapamycin. These experiments confirm that the growth-deficient phenotype seen on histidine-dropout media was due to the degradation of the Tor-His3 reporter, and that the 26S proteasome is necessary for this to occur. Purified Proteasomes Are Sufficient for DTL—To demonstrate ubiquitin-independence and that the 26S proteasome is not only necessary but also sufficient for DTL, in vitro experiments were performed in which the only components were purified proteasomes and reporter proteins. Whole, functional 26S proteasomes have been previously affinity-purified for use in biochemical assays (20Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The same procedure was used to isolate proteasomes from strain Rpn10-FPR1. HA epitope-tagged versions of Tor-His3 and TorS1972R-His3 were purified from a bacterial expression system and then mixed with the proteasomes, with or without rapamycin. Samples were extracted at regular intervals, and reporter degradation was monitored by Western analysis (Fig. 4a). The in vitro results mirrored what was seen with the in vivo Westerns blots. All of the experiments using purified TorS1972R-His3 showed no degradation. Degradation of Tor-His3 was observed only in the presence of rapamycin and proteasomes isolated from strain Rpn10-FPR1. The half-life of the reporter was on the order of 15 min (Fig. 4b), comparable with what was observed in vivo. Once again, proteolysis of Tor-His3 could be halted upon the addition of the proteasome inhibitor PS-341. These results, in combination with the in vivo experiments, demonstrate that localization to the proteasome is sufficient for the initiation of degradation. It is not known what role, if any, polyubiquitin chains serve beyond targeting substrates to the proteasome. In this study, we demonstrated that once a substrate is localized to the proteasome, additional signals are not required for degradation to occur. To test our DTL hypothesis, we designed a system using chemical inducers of dimerization to artificially associate reporters with proteasome subunits. We then established a functional screen to identify strain candidates for DTL. If our hypothesis was correct, we expected to isolate Tor-His3-expressing Fpr1-tagged strains that were deficient for growth on rapamycin-containing media. Strains Pre10-FPR1 and Rpn10-FPR1 exhibited such phenotypes. Western blot assays performed on whole-cell extracts from these strains confirmed that inactivation of the reporter proteins was due to their proteolysis. Furthermore, we showed that the proteasome was necessary for this degradation by arresting the process with the addition of the inhibitor PS-341. Finally, in a ubiquitin-free in vitro system we demonstrated that purified 26S proteasome alone was sufficient to mediate DTL. Although our results cannot rule out a model in which polyubiquitin chains stimulate or catalyze degradation, they confirm that any additional functions beyond tethering substrates to the proteasome are not strictly necessary for proteolysis to occur. Seven proteasome subunits were randomly selected for Fpr1-tagging, as it was not known which, if any, would display a phenotype consistent with DTL. The tagged subunit that produced the strongest effect was Rpn10, interestingly one of the few proteasome subunits that has been shown to bind to polyubiquitin chains (9Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about Pre10, an essential protein that forms part of the proteolytic core particle (25Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. Dow S. Lucau-Danila A.

Nature. 2002; 418: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar) and which showed a mild but reproducible phenotype in our assay. Strains Rpn2-FPR1 and Rpt5-FPR1 showed comparable growth on plates containing or lacking rapamycin. Western analysis of strains Rpn2-FPR1 and Rpt5-FPR1 established that both fusion proteins migrated at their expected molecular masses and, therefore, were correctly expressed. Rpt5 is another subunit that has been reported to recognize ubiquitin chains as indicated by crosslinking experiments (10Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The fact that DTL did not occur for these strains implies that either dimerization of the modules was unsuccessful, or that despite localization to the proteasome, degradation was not initiated. The ability of an Fpr1-tagged subunit to promote DTL is dependent upon a number of factors, including substrate accessibility for the Fpr1-tag, stability of the tag, and proximity of a bound target to any substrate-processing site such as the ATPase assembly. We are currently testing whether dimerization of the modules actually occurs in strains Rpn2-FPR1 and Rpt5-FPR1. If so, these strains could be used to recruit factors to the proteasome without their proteolysis. In addition to being used as a screen, the gradient growth assay also served as an important functional control. There are reports of observations of ubiquitin-independent degradation of denatured substrates in vitro (26Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 27Dick L.R. Aldrich C. Jameson S.C. Moomaw C.R. Pramanik B.C. Doyle C.K. DeMartino G.N. Bevan M.J. Forman J.M. Slaughter C.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3884-3894PubMed Google Scholar). There is also evidence that the proteasome will degrade functional but highly unstable substrates in a ubiquitin-independent manner (28David D.C. Layfield R. Serpell L. Narain Y. Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 29Jariel-Encontre I. Pariat M. Martin F. Carillo S. Salvat C. Piechaczyk M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20295-20301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the substrates were neither denatured nor unstable. The reporters were fully functional, as demonstrated by the growth assay and also by the ability of Tor to bind to Fpr1-rapamycin. Furthermore, we know that binding of rapamycin itself did not destabilize the substrates; a growth-deficient phenotype was not observed in the untagged DY001 parental strain expressing free Fpr1 in addition to the reporters (data not shown). Unlike denatured or labile polypeptides, stable proteins need to be unfolded to enter the narrow channel into the 20S proteolytic core (5Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar, 31Benaroudj N. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2000; 2: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This process is thought to be facilitated by the six ATPase subunits, which exhibit both chaperone-like and nonspecific unfoldase activity and form part of the base for the 19S regulatory particle (31Benaroudj N. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2000; 2: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5565-5572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The simplest model consistent with these data is that substrates held at the proteasome are driven toward an unfolded state through their association with the ATPase subunits, and that degradation follows once this is achieved (34Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 35Matouschek A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The results of our study support this model as opposed to more elaborate models that postulate additional steps for proteolysis to occur. We observed a range of rates in DTL that was dependent upon the FPR1-tagged strain used. That degradation was observed at all suggests that precise positioning of the substrate with respect to the proteasome is not strictly necessary for proteolysis. However, the positional bias observed in our study suggests that there is an optimal topological arrangement for presenting substrates to the ATPases for unfolding. This is the likely conformation assumed by proteins bound to the proteasome through polyubiquitin chains. The rapamycin-induced half-life of the reporter protein in the strain Rpn10-FPR1 was ∼20 min, which is rapid and comparable with that of polyubiquitinated substrates. Our results suggest a novel approach to protein therapeutics. The current paradigm in screening small molecule libraries is to find inhibitors of enzymatic processes that are causal in disease. However, the fraction of small molecules that both specifically bind to and inhibit the function of a protein target is extremely small. The continuing development of PROTACS (36Sakamoto K.M. Kim K.B. Kumagai A. Mercurio F. Crews C.M. Deshaies R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8554-8559Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 37Sakamoto K.M. Kim K.B. Verma R. Ransick A.

We propose to bypass the ubiquitination step and generate small molecules that will promote the degradation of disease-causing proteins through heterodimerization with the proteasome. In addition, we are investigating the possibility of expanding the system used in this study into a generalized method for the facile construction of conditional protein knockdowns. Fusing the Tor module to endogenous proteins of choice in an Rpn10-FPR1 strain background should permit rapamycin-dependent control of degradation. One advantage such a system would have over technologies such as RNA interference (38Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11430) Google Scholar) and promoter shutoff assays (39Baron U. Bujard H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 401-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) is that it would directly target proteins for degradation, whereas the two referenced technologies affect transcript levels and are, therefore, dependent upon the natural half-lives of targets for functional knockdowns.

Protein related to DAN and cerberus (PRDC) is a secreted protein with a cystine knot structure identified by gene trapping in embryonic stem cells. Although PRDC shows sequence homology with proteins of the BMP antagonist family, its biological activity and physiological functions are unclear. We generated recombinant PRDC and its paralog, gremlin, and tested their ability to suppress actions initiated by diverse BMP proteins. Similar to the known BMP antagonist, gremlin, PRDC blocked ligand signaling induced by BMP2 and BMP4 but had minimal effects on reporter gene activation induced by GDF-9, activin, or transforming growth factor-β. Co-precipitation assays further demonstrated the direct protein-protein interactions between PRDC and BMP2 or BMP4. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses indicated that PRDC transcripts are widely expressed showing higher levels in ovary, brain, and spleen. In mouse ovary, PRDC transcripts were increased following gonadotropin treatment. In situ hybridization analyses further indicated that ovarian PRDC transcripts are localized in granulosa cells of selective follicles. In addition, co-treatment with PRDC antagonized the inhibitory effects of BMP4 on the follicle-stimulating hormone stimulation of progesterone production by cultured rat granulosa cells. Thus, PRDC is a potent BMP antagonist with a wide tissue expression pattern, and ovarian PRDC expressed in granulosa cells could be involved in follicular development by antagonizing the actions of theca cell-derived BMPs.

By using a bioinformatic approach, we analyzed all human genes with unique cystine knot structures similar to known BMP antagonists (10Avsian-Kretchmer O. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Based on the size of the cystine ring, BMP antagonists were classified into three subfamilies as follows: CAN (eight-membered ring), twisted gastrulation (nine-membered ring), and chordin and noggin (10-membered rings). The CAN family consists of seven members, including gremlin, protein related to DAN and cerberus (PRDC), and others. PRDC was discovered in mouse embryonic stem cells by gene trapping (11Minabe-Saegusa C. Saegusa H. Tsukahara M. Noguchi S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1998; 40: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although PRDC, a close paralog of gremlin, was found to be expressed in commissural neurons of the spinal cord in the mouse embryo, its tissue expression pattern and potential role as a BMP antagonist are unclear. Here we produced recombinant human PRDC and examined its tissue expression pattern and biological functions as a BMP antagonist. Based on the high expression of PRDC in mouse ovary, its regulation by gonadotropins and ovarian expression pattern were tested. We also demonstrated that PRDC antagonized the inhibitory effects of BMP4 on FSH-induced progesterone production in granulosa cells. Animals—Adult Swiss-Webster mice were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and used for RT-PCR studies to elucidate tissue distribution of PRDC and gremlin. To investigate the regulation of PRDC in mouse ovary, 23-day-old female Swiss-Webster mice were injected with 4 IU of PMSG, followed by 10 IU of hCG 48 h later. For granulosa cell cultures, 25-day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats treated with diethylstilbestrol were used (12Hsueh A.J. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 76-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Animals were housed in accordance with institutional and National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. Hormones and Reagents—DMEM/Ham's F-12 (DMEM/F-12), McCoy's 5a medium, L-15 Leibovitz medium, α-minimum essential medium, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) were obtained from Invitrogen. Recombinant human BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, BMP7, TGF-β1, activin-A, and recombinant mouse GDF-5 were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant GDF-9 was generated in transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells and characterized as described previously (13Hayashi M. McGee E.A. Min G. Klein C. Rose U.M. van Duin M. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1236-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies and FLAG peptide were from Sigma. Biotinylated anti-mouse gremlin antibody and biotinylated anti-BMP-2/4 antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. Anti-human PRDC antibodies were generated by using a synthetic peptide encoding the following sequence: Ac-CFYIPRHVKKEEESFQ-amide (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). This stretch of 16 residues was designed based on human PRDC and showed 93% homology to mouse and rat PRDC. The antiserum titer was checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the synthetic peptide as the antigen. This PRDC antibody does not cross-react with recombinant gremlin (data not shown). Generation of PRDC and Gremlin cDNAs—PCR was performed using Advantage cDNA kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and a human ovary Marathon-Ready cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Fidelity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing on both strands of the final constructs before use in expression studies. All cDNA were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen). To allow efficient detection and purification of the recombinant protein, a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was added to the C terminus of PRDC (PRDC-CT) or the N terminus of gremlin (gremlin-NT). After purification of these tagged proteins using anti-FLAG M2 affinity column (Sigma) and verification by Coomassie Blue staining, the purified tagged proteins were used as standards to quantify nontagged recombinant PRDC and gremlin in conditioned media using immunoblotting. Expression of Recombinant Human PRDC and Gremlin Proteins in 293T Cells—Human 293T cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were transfected using 10 μg of plasmid by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (14Kudo M. Osuga Y. Kobilka B.K. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22470-22478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines stably expressing wild type and FLAG-tagged PRDC and gremlin were selected under 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and maintained in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS and 100 μg/ml Zeocin. When the cells reached 90-100% confluency, the medium was replaced with DMEM/F-12 without FBS or Zeocin. After 3 days of serum-free culture, the condition media were harvested, and cell debris was cleared. For some experiments, the supernatant was concentrated 20-fold using Amicon Ultra (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Characterization of Recombinant Human PRDC and Gremlin—Conditioned media from 293T cells expressing PRDC or gremlin were electrophoresed using 12% SDS-PAGE before transfer of proteins to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were performed using anti-PRDC antisera (1: 1000 dilution), anti-mouse gremlin antibody (0.15 μg/ml), or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody as primary antibodies. Signals were detected following immunofluorescent imaging using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To remove N-linked carbohydrate side chains, conditioned media were diluted in the deglycosylation buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with 7.7 mIU of peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were mixed with loading buffer under reducing conditions (100 mm dithiothreitol and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) before immunoblotting. Luciferase Reporter Assay—The reporter plasmids, SBE-lux and CAGA-lux, were provided by C. H. Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research). The SBE promoter was activated by both the BMP and TGF-β/activin pathways (15Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), whereas the CAGA promoter was activated by the TGF-β/activin pathway mediated by Smad3 (16Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. When cells were 60-70% confluent in 24-well plates, transient transfection of reporter plasmids was performed with 1.3 μg of DNA per well using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) for 4 h. To monitor transfection efficiency, 50 ng of the pCMV-β-galactosidase vector was also included. After transfection, cells were treated for 24 h with the appropriate combinations of BMP-related ligands together with PRDC or gremlin preincubated for 30 min. After treatment, cells were harvested by incubation with 200 μl of lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and 30 μl of cell lysate were used for detection of luciferase activity by using a luminometer (Lumimark microplate reader from Bio-Rad). To measure the β-galactosidase activity, 50 μl of cell lysate was used. The reporter activity is expressed as the ratio of relative light units/β-galactosidase activity. Data are shown as the mean ± S.D. of triplicates from representative experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation of PRDC with BMP2 or BMP4 —To demonstrate direct binding between PRDC and BMP2/4, a co-immunoprecipitation test was performed using FLAG-tagged Protein Immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma) and Handee Cup Columns (Pierce). One microgram of FLAG-tagged PRDC (PRDC-CT) was first incubated with 1 μg of BMP2 or BMP4 in TBS (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature. Preincubated samples were then applied onto M2 columns for further incubation (2 h at 4 °C) with gentle rocking. After obtaining the pass-through fractions, 15 μg of the 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) was added to the column to elute the complexes of PRDC-CT and BMP2/4. Before immunoblotting, BMP2 or BMP4 in the eluate was detected by the biotinylated anti-BMP-2/4 antibody. RT-PCR and Northern Blotting—Total RNA from mouse tissue was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Samples were transcribed into cDNAs using Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and oligo(dT)12-18 (Invitrogen). A mouse PRDC fragment (290 bp) was amplified using primers 5′-ctctgtcatcgtagagctcgaat-3′ and 5′-aagcttcacttgtggtcctcatt-3′ by performing 35 cycles of PCR (94 °C, 30 s; 62 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 45 s). The PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. For real time PCR, ovarian PRDC and β-actin cDNAs were amplified using the QuantiTect Probe PCR kit (Qiagen) and analyzed in the Smart Cycler II System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). Webtool Primer3 www.broad.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi was used for designing PCR primers and probes. Primers for mouse PRDC (5′-ctctgtcatcgtagagctcgaat-3′ and 5′-ggagtcactcaggttcactgacat-3′) yielded a 109-bp amplicon, and 5′-6-FAM-aatccagaaggtgaagcattgccg TAMRA-3′ was selected as the Taqman probe. Thermal cycling condition was 95 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Northern blotting procedure has been described previously (17Chun S.Y. Bae H.W. Kim W.J. Park J.H. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using 32P-labeled probes for mouse PRDC. For data normalization, blots were stripped by boiling in 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS for 30 min before reprobing with a cDNA probe for rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In Situ Hybridization—Mouse ovaries were fixed at 4 °C for 6 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by immersion in 0.5 m sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline overnight. Cryostat sections (14 μm thick) were mounted on Superfrost/Plus (Fisher), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at -80 °C until analyzed. As described previously (18Leo C.P. Hsu S.Y. Chun S.Y. Bae H.W. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5469-5477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), hybridization was carried out at 52-55 °C overnight in a mixture containing the 35S-labeled mouse PRDC cRNA probe, 50% formamide, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 μg/ml carrier transfer RNA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Posthybridization washing was performed under stringent conditions that included ribonuclease A (25 μg/ml) treatment at 37 °C for 30 min and a final stringency of 0.1× SSC. Slides were dipped into NTB-2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.), exposed at 4 °C, and developed after 2 weeks. The slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined under the light microscope with bright- and dark-field illumination. Culture of Granulosa Cells—Granulosa cells were obtained from small antral follicles of diethylstilbestrol-treated rats (12Hsueh A.J. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 76-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Ovaries were punctured in L-15 Leibovitz medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Ovarian debris, oocytes, and small follicles were removed, and the remaining medium containing granulosa cells was collected after low speed centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. Granulosa cells (1 × 105 viable cells/ml) were cultured using McCoy's 5a media supplemented with androstenedione (10-7 m) in the presence or absence of different hormones. After 48 h of incubation, the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C until the determination of progesterone content by using antisera raised against progesterone-11-hemisuccinate/bovine serum albumin (19Vitt U.A. Hayashi M. Klein C. Hsueh A.J. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Production and Characterization of Recombinant Human PRDC and Gremlin—The mouse PRDC gene encodes a protein with a signal peptide for secretion and shares high homology with gremlin (11Minabe-Saegusa C. Saegusa H. Tsukahara M. Noguchi S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1998; 40: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We searched the human ortholog of mouse PRDC in the GenBank™ using the BLAST program, and we performed RT-PCR using an ovarian cDNA library to obtain the full-length human PRDC cDNA. Human 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors containing human PRDC cDNA or PRDC tagged at its C terminus with a FLAG epitope (PRDC-CT). Following selection of permanent clones, individual cell lines were cultured to obtain conditioned media. Immunoblotting was performed using PRDC antibodies or M2 antibodies against the FLAG epitope. Three prominent PRDC bands at 23, 19, and 18 kDa likely represented PRDC proteins with different degrees of N-linked glycosylation, whereas a lower 16-kDa band could be a proteolytic PRDC fragment (Fig. 1A). After treatment with PNGase F, only the 19-, 18-, and 16-kDa bands were evident. Based on sequence analyses (10Avsian-Kretchmer O. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the PRDC gene encodes a peptide of 19 kDa after signal peptide removal. The mature peptide has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn26 and Asn161) and one potential proteolytic processing site (Lys66). Thus, the 23-kDa band may represent glycosylated PRDC, whereas the 16-kDa band could be a proteolytic fragment. The PRDC antibodies also recognized two nonspecific high molecular weight bands in mock-transfected cells. Because the present PRDC antibodies do not recognize the recombinant PRDC under nonreducing conditions, we also generated C-terminal tagged PRDC, and we analyzed its properties under both reducing and nonreducing conditions using PRDC (Fig. 1A) and M2 (Fig. 1B) antibodies. Compared with the native protein, the PRDC-CT migrated in a similar manner under reducing and deglycosylated conditions. Of interest, immunoblotting of tagged PRDC under nonreducing conditions yielded diffused high molecular mass bands of ∼40 kDa, suggesting the presence of PRDC dimers. We also characterized the recombinant human gremlin proteins generated by using a similar approach. Under reducing conditions, immunoblot analyses indicated that gremlin is also a glycosylated protein, with a higher molecular mass 24-kDa band migrating as a 20-kDa band following treatment with PNGase F (Fig. 2A). Under nonreducing conditions, a weak higher molecular mass band (40 kDa) corresponding to dimer forms was also detected. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that this band is nonspecific. By using either gremlin (Fig. 2A) or the M2 antibodies (Fig. 2B), the N-terminally tagged gremlin (gremlin-NT) also behaved as a glycosylated protein. Both PRDC-CT and gremlin-NT were purified with affinity chromatography and used to estimate the amount of their nontagged counterparts for functional studies as described below. Ability of PRDC and Gremlin to Suppress the BMP Induction of Luciferase Reporter Activities—By taking advantage of luciferase reporter plasmids capable of responding to Smad activation (15Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 16Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar), we tested the inhibitory effect of PRDC and gremlin on luciferase reporter activities induced by various TGF-β superfamily ligands (Fig. 3). P19 cells transfected with the SBE promoter-luciferase construct responded to treatment with BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and BMP7 but showed minimal stimulation by GDF-5. Of interest, co-treatment with either PRDC or gremlin suppressed BMP-induced luciferase reporter activities (Fig. 3A). At 25 nm, PRDC and gremlin completely suppressed luciferase reporter activity induced by BMP2 or BMP4. However, PRDC attenuated the actions of BMP6 and BMP7 by only 30% (p < 0.05), whereas gremlin did not significantly decrease the reporter activity induced by BMP6 or BMP7. Both PRDC and gremlin were ineffective in blocking GDF5 actions. By using the CAGA promoter-luciferase reporter, the ability of PRDC and gremlin to modulate the actions of activin, TGF-β, and GDF-9 was tested (Fig. 3B). Treatment of cells transfected with the CAGA promoter with activin, TGF-β, or GDF-9 led to increases in reporter activities. In contrast to their regulation of BMP actions, PRDC or gremlin did not affect the reporter activity induced by activin, TGF-β, or GDF-9. Similar results were obtained when these experiments were performed by using the SBE promoter (data not shown). To evaluate the potency of PRDC and gremlin in antagonizing the BMP actions, we tested the dose dependence of these BMP antagonists by using the luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 4). Co-treatment with PRDC inhibited the stimulation of luciferase activity by BMP2 and BMP4 in a dose-dependent manner (IC50, 3 and 2.5 nm, respectively). Likewise, co-treatment with gremlin inhibited the actions of BMP2 and BMP4 with a similar potency (IC50, 3 and 2.8 nm, respectively). Similar to the recombinant non-tagged PRDC, C-tagged PRDC also antagonized the actions of BMP2 and BMP4 in the present luciferase reporter activity assay (Fig. 4A). The tagged PRDC was then used for co-immunoprecipitation tests. Direct Interactions between PRDC and BMP2 or BMP4 —To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the antagonistic effects of PRDC on BMP2 or BMP4 actions, co-immunoprecipitation tests were performed using PRDC-CT and affinity beads containing covalently linked M2 antibodies. BMP2 or BMP4 proteins (1 μg each) were co-incubated with PRDC-CT or boiled PRDC-CT (1 μg each) before mixing with the M2-affinity beads. Proteins not bound by the M2 beads (pass-through fractions) and those eluted with a buffer containing the FLAG peptide (eluate) were analyzed in immunoblots using anti-BMP2/4 antibodies (Fig. 5). Although the BMP2 or BMP4 proteins preincubated with PRDC were retained in the eluate, BMP2 or BMP4 incubated with boiled PRDC was only found in the pass-through fraction. As expected, BMP2 or BMP4 proteins by themselves were also found in the pass-through fraction. These results demonstrated the direct binding between these two BMP proteins and tagged PRDC. Tissue Expression Pattern of PRDC—Although an earlier study demonstrated the localization of PRDC mRNA in commissural neurons of the developing spinal cord of mouse embryos (11Minabe-Saegusa C. Saegusa H. Tsukahara M. Noguchi S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1998; 40: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the tissue expression pattern of PRDC in other stages and tissues is unclear. To elucidate the tissue expression pattern of PRDC in adult mice, we performed RT-PCR analyses using different amounts of the template cDNA. As shown in Fig. 6, PRDC was expressed most abundantly in the ovary, followed by brain, spleen, colon, kidney, and uterus. Even at a 100-fold dilution of the template cDNA, the ovary still showed a clear signal. These data suggest that PRDC is a BMP antagonist showing wide tissue expression in adult tissues. Ovarian PRDC Expression Is Regulated by Gonadotropins— We further monitored PRDC mRNA levels in the ovary. As shown in Fig. 7A, quantitative real time PCR studies indicated that treatment of immature mice with PMSG to induce follicle maturation led to a small increase in PRDC expression. Subsequent treatment with hCG to induce ovulation is correlated with a decrease of PRDC message levels. Furthermore, Northern blot analyses (Fig. 7B) indicated similar regulation of a 4.0-kb PRDC transcript by gonadotropins. These results suggested that PRDC expressed in the ovary could participate in the regulation of follicle development. Localization of PRDC Transcripts in Mouse Ovary—To investigate the ovarian cell types expressing PRDC, we performed in situ hybridization analyses (Fig. 8). The PRDC signal was localized to mural and cumulus granulosa cells in selective early antral follicles of immature mice without exogenous gonadotropin treatment. At 12 and 48 h after PMSG treatment, PRDC transcripts were found in mural and cumulus granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles. In contrast, neither oocytes nor theca-interstitial cells showed PRDC signals. PRDC Antagonized BMP4-induced Suppression of Progesterone Production by Cultured Granulosa Cells—Earlier studies have shown that co-treatment with BMP4 suppressed progesterone production induced by FSH in cultured rat granulosa cells (20Shimasaki S. Zachow R.J. Li D. Kim H. Iemura S. Ueno N. Sampath K. Chang R.J. Erickson G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7282-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we investigated the potential antagonizing effect of PRDC on BMP4 actions. Granulosa cells were treated with FSH to stimulate progesterone production (Fig. 9). Some cells were also treated with BMP4 with or without PRDCs that were preincubated together for 30 min at 37 °C. Forty eight hours after cell culture, progesterone levels in the conditioned medium were determined. Co-treatment with BMP4 suppressed the FSH stimulation of progesterone production by 60%. However, preincubation of BMP4 with PRDC prevented the suppressive effect of BMP4 on FSH actions (p < 0.01; Fig. 9A). Similar to PRDC, preincubation of BMP4 with gremlin also antagonized the inhibitory effect of BMP4 on the FSH stimulation of progesterone production (p < 0.01; Fig. 9B). We generated recombinant PRDC and showed it to be a glycoprotein capable of forming dimers that could function as a BMP antagonist. Compared with gremlin, a known BMP antagonist, PRDC showed broader inhibitory effects by blocking the Smad signaling induced by BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, or BMP7. Co-precipitation tests indicated that the observed antagonistic effect of PRDC is likely due to the direct binding of PRDC to BMP proteins. Of interest, the PRDC transcript was abundantly expressed in the ovary and regulated by gonadotropins. In situ hybridization demonstrated that mouse PRDC transcripts were expressed in mural and cumulus granulosa cells. In cultured granulosa cells, PRDC treatment antagonized the inhibitory effects of BMP4 on the FSH stimulation of progesterone production. These results suggest that PRDC is a potent BMP antagonist and participates in ovarian paracrine regulation. To regulate BMP signaling extracellularly, BMP antago"

Cell locomotion or changes in cell shape are mediated by the rapid polymerization of actin in response to signaling. The source for this massive increase in F-actin is provided by a large reservoir of unassembled, “sequestered” actin, which is kept monomeric by interaction with G-actin-binding proteins (1dos Remedios C.G.

Finally, in binding to G-actin, Tβ4 slows down metal ion/nucleotide dissociation (13Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Furman M.I. Wachsstock D. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol.

This protein is composed of a single WH2 domain, which has recently been identified in 37 other proteins belonging to various organisms, and was shown to be an evolutionarily conserved actin-monomer binding motif (15Paunola E. Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, different WH2 domains were found to perform different functions in the regulation of actin monomeric concentration and actin assembly processes. Whereas β-thymosins inhibit the assembly of actin filaments, the other WH2 domains characterized thus far display a profiling-like activity, promoting the assembly of actin filaments at the barbed end (16Egile C.

A fine structural and dynamic characterization of WH2 domain interfaces with actin is therefore essential to understand the functional variability of WH2 domains.Whereas the structure and interface with actin of other G-actin binding proteins such as DNase I (21Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), gelsolin segment-1 (22McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G.

Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) are well known from crystallographic studies, Tβ4 and, more generally, WH2 domains remain elusive. NMR studies have shown that Tβ4 was mostly unstructured in aqueous solution, except for a short helical region (residues 5-16) at low temperature (24Czisch M. Schleicher M. Horger S. Voelter W. Holak T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies indicated that the α-helical structure of this region was required for binding to actin (25Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Feinberg J. Heitz F. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 3530-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Biochemical results based mainly on chemical cross-linking indicated that Tβ4 bound G-actin in an extended conformation, with the N-terminal helical region (residues 1-19) making contacts with residues in subdomain 1 of actin, whereas the C-terminal region could be cross-linked to His40 and Gln41 of actin in subdomain 2 (12De La Cruz E.M.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). According to these results, the ability of Tβ4 to interfere with actin-actin contacts involved in filament assembly at both the barbed and pointed ends of the actin monomer was thought to account for its inhibition of polymerization via a simple steric mechanism and also for its competition with profilin and DNase I for binding to G-actin. Recent biochemical and thermodynamic studies of the binding of Tβ4 to CaATP-actin and MgATP-actin, based mainly on fluorescence quenching of 5-(2-acetylaminoethylamino)naphtalene-5-sulfonate conjugated to Cys374 of actin upon Tβ4 binding and on tritium exchange, also suggested that this small protein changed the conformation and structural dynamics of actin monomers (12De La Cruz E.M.

J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Our study constitutes the first essential step for the understanding of the molecular basis of G-actin sequestration by thymosin β4. A number of specificities of the biological system under study render its structural analysis especially challenging for both crystallography and NMR. The tendency of G-actin to self-assemble, even at low ionic strength, at concentrations greater than 50-70 μm, the high flexibility of Tβ4, and the limited stability of the Tβ4-G-actin complex at high concentrations have hampered crystallization of the complex thus far. These difficulties, combined with the large size of the complex (47 kDa), preclude 1H, 15N, 13C NMR spectroscopy studies of the Tβ4-actin complex that require long acquisition periods. Here we show that the assignment of the whole 15N-1HN correlation spectra of Tβ4 bound to monomeric CaATP-actin and MgATP-actin is successfully performed using an alternative strategy based on appropriately chosen specific labels. Our results demonstrate that the whole Tβ4 backbone is tightly bound to monomeric actin and that the structures of the peptide bound to CaATP-actin, MgATP-actin, and subtilin-cleaved actin are identical. The secondary structure of actin-bound thymosin β4 is obtained, and novel information is also provided about its fast dynamics using 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments. A hypothetical model of the complex is proposed, based on biochemical data and our NMR results.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein ProductionActin—Actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder (30Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated in the CaATP-G-actin form by chromatography through Sephadex G-200 (31MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) in G buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl-, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.01% NaN3). Subtilisin-cleaved actin was obtained as described previously (24Czisch M. Schleicher M. Horger S. Voelter W. Holak T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, CaATP-G-actin (25-50 μm) in G buffer was incubated with subtilisin (Sigma) at a 1:1500 (w/w) ratio to actin at 20 °C for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. SDS-PAGE showed that >95% of the 42-kDa actin polypeptide had been converted into a 37-kDa fragment, with no further degradation. Pyrenyl-labeled actin was prepared as described previously (32Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar).Thymosin β4 and Thymosin β10 —Recombinant thymosins β4 and β10 were bacterially expressed in Escherichia coli using pET3d vectors kindly provided by Dr. Helen Lu Yin (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Bacteria (BL21(DE3) strain) were grown at 28 °C in diverse media depending on the labeling: (a) [U-15N]Tβ4 and [U-15N]Tβ10, minimal (M9) medium containing 1 g/liter [15N]NH4Cl and supplemented with 5 mg/liter thiamine, 0.2% glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.1 mm CaCl2; (b) [U-15N,13C]Tβ4, minimal (M9) medium containing 1 g/liter [15N]NH4Cl and 2 g/liter [13C]glucose and supplemented with 5 mg/liter thiamine, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.1 mm CaCl2; and (c) [15N]AA Tβ4 (AA was alternatively Thr, Lys, Leu, and Ser), M9 medium implemented with amino acids (40 mg/liter), except the one to be labeled. 50 mg/liter of the labeled amino acid was added when the optical density was equal to 0.2.The expression of all Tβ4 variants was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the optical density of the culture was 0.4. Bacteria were collected 2 h and 30 min later. The bacterial extract was treated with HClO4 (up to 4%/v). The acid-soluble Tβ4 solution was brought to pH 4, loaded on a 4 × 25-cm RP 18 (Merck) column, eluted by 33% n-propanol in H2O, and further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography using two consecutive preparative columns (2.5 × 25 cm, Hibar Lichrospher 100 RP-18E; Merck) and a 5-28% acetonitrile gradient.Selective Labeling of Thymosin β4 —The selective labeling strategy was chosen to minimally perturb the culture conditions already used for the previous production of recombinant Tβ4. In particular, the same bacteria strain was used. Because “pseudo-rich” conditions were used for bacteria growth, the protein yield was better than for uniform labeling, around 7 mg protein/culture liter.Two main criteria were important for the choice of the labeled amino acid: (a) first, the frequency and position of the amino acid along the sequence; and (b) second, the possibility to specifically label the amino acid using the BL21(DE3) bacteria strain. This second criteria can be quite restrictive because a number of metabolic leakages and transaminase activities can lead to partial or complete dilution of the labeling for a number of amino acids (33McIntosh L.P. Dahlquist F.W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 34Karp P.D. Riley M. Saier M. Paulsen I.T. Collado-Vides J. Paley S.M. Pellegrini-Toole A. Bonavides C. Gama-Castro S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 56-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Considering the first criteria, the four amino acids Lys, Leu, Thr, and Ser were particularly interesting. Lysine is the most frequent amino acid in the sequence (Lys3, Lys11, Lys14, Lys16, Lys18, Lys19, Lys25, Lys31, and Lys38); it is nicely spread along the whole sequence and is part of the LKKTET fragment (residues 17-22 in Tβ4), which is known to be a consensus recognition motif for actin-binding proteins. Threonine and leucine were also selected for their presence in the consensus motif (Thr20, Thr22, and Thr33; Leu17 and Leu28). Moreover, the assignment of Leu28 is particularly difficult due to its sandwiched position between two prolines. Finally, serine was initially selected due to its distribution along the sequence (Ser1, Ser15, Ser30, and Ser43). However, the specific labeling of this residue could not be obtained using the BL21 bacteria strain, and a partial uniform labeling was obtained instead. This is probably due to a significant metabolic leakage from serine to glutamate, which itself leads to a metabolic leakage toward all other amino acids (33McIntosh L.P. Dahlquist F.W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the case of leucines, leakages were also observed, but to a much smaller extent, and two main peaks corresponding to Leu17 and Leu28 were observed in the HSQC spectra of free [15N]Leu Tβ4. The most intense secondary peaks correspond to isoleucines Ile9 and Ile34. These were, however, beyond detection in the complex. The addition of [15N]Thr in the culture media yielded a protein mainly [15N]Thr-labeled, with a significant but lower level of [15N]Gly and [15N]Ser labeling. These two extra labelings can be explained through a first primary leakage from threonine toward glycine and a secondary leakage from glycine toward serine (33McIntosh L.P. Dahlquist F.W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Finally, the addition of [15N]Lys in the culture media yielded a fully selective [15N]Lys labeling of Tβ4. No leakage was observable from the observation of the HSQC spectrum.NMR Samples and ExperimentsNMR Samples—Thymosin NMR samples consisted of 15N-labeled thymosins at a concentration of 1-2mm ina4mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) containing 10 μm ATP, 20 μm Ca2+, 10% D2O, and 0.01% sodium azide. NMR samples of complexes between actin and thymosins were prepared by mixing 20 ml of 47 μm actin with thymosins taken from a 2 mm stock solution up to a 1:1 molar ratio, occasionally with a small excess of thymosins. The proteins were then concentrated up to 350-500 μm complex using a Centriprep 30 device (Amicon) and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 45 min. The complexes were stored in G buffer containing 5 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% D2O, and 0.01% sodium azide. The final pH value was 6.9.NMR Experiments—NMR experiments were performed on Bruker Avance 600 MHz and 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with 5-mm triple resonance gradient probes. Quadrature phase detection in the indirectly detected dimension was obtained via States-TPPI mode (35Marion D. Kay L.E. Sparks S.W. Torchia D.A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1515-1517Crossref Scopus (590) Google Scholar). A Watergate sequence was used in all experiments to achieve water signal suppression (36Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3496) Google Scholar).Assignment of 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances of Tβ4 free in solution was obtained using standard procedures from two-dimensional 1H-1H NOESY and total correlation spectroscopy experiments, three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC, and three-dimensional 1H-15N total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC experiments and HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCANH, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments. Mixing time for NOESY experiments was set to 120 ms. Two mixing times of 50 and 80 ms were used for total correlation spectroscopy experiments.Chemical shifts were referred to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. CSIs (37Wishart D.S.

R1(NZ) experiments were performed with 10 relaxation delays (0.012, 0.048, 0.072, 0.144, 0.300, 0.420, 0.600, 0.840, 1.200, and 2.400 s). For R2(NXY) experiments, a set of 10 experiments was acquired, with relaxation delays of 0.008, 0.024, 0.040, 0.080, 0.136, 0.200, 0.304, 0.480, 0.640, and 0.800 s. In the two sets of experiments, the points corresponding to different relaxation delays were acquired in an interleaved manner to avoid any bias that could arise from progressive shim degradation. For all experiments, carrier frequencies were set at 117 ppm in the F1 dimension (15N) and 7.6 ppm in the F2 dimension. Spectral widths were 23 ppm in the F1 (15N) dimension and 3.5 ppm in the F2 (1HN) dimension. Cross-peak intensities were determined from peak heights using the SPARKY peak picking routine (Goddard, T. D., and Kneller, D. G. SPARKY 3 Software, University of California, San Francisco, CA). The relaxation rate constants R1(NZ) and R2(NXY) were obtained from nonlinear fits to mono-exponential functions using the Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm (45Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teutolski S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipies, The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, 1986: 523-527Google Scholar). The quality of the fits and error estimations were obtained using established Monte Carlo procedures, with an experimental gaussian error set to 4 times the rms base plane noise level and using 500 synthetic data for each NH vector. 15N NOE enhancements were obtained as the ratio of the peak heights in the spectra recorded with and without saturation of protons during the relaxation delay.For 15N-1H HSQC experiments carried on Tβ4-actin complex, carrier frequencies were set at 117 ppm in the F1 dimension (15N) and 7.6 ppm in the F2 dimension. Spectral widths were 28 ppm in the F1 (15N) dimension and 5 ppm in the F2 (1HN) dimension. The three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC experiment used for the assignment of Tβ4 bound to actin was performed with a mixing time equal to 40 ms.Measurements of the Binding of Tβ4 to G-actin and Subtilisin-cleaved ActinThe affinity of Tβ4 for actin or subtilisin-cleaved actin (subactin) was derived from the increase in actin tryptophane fluorescence (λexc, 295 nm; λem, 350 nm) linked to the binding of Tβ4 (46Jean C. Rieger K. Blanchoin L. Carlier M.F. Lenfant M. Pantaloni D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in a Spex spectrofluorimeter at 20 °C, using 2 μm CaATPG-actin or subtilisin-cleaved actin in G buffer containing only 20 μm ATP to minimize the screen effect.The relative increase in fluorescence, (F - F0)/(Fmax - F0), was expressed as function of the molar fraction of actin in complex with Tβ4, (TA)/(A0), according to the following equation.(F−F0)(Fmax−F0)=[TA][A0]=([A0]+[T0]+K)−([A0]+[T0]+K)2−4[A0][T0]2A0(Eq. 1) Alternatively, the affinity of Tβ4 for subtilisin-cleaved actin could be derived from its sequestering activity, by measuring the amount of F-actin at steady state in the presence of different concentrations of Tβ4 (25Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 47Carlier M.F. Didry D. Erk I. Lepault J. Van Troys M.L.

The concentration of F-actin, Cw, was derived from the fluorescence of pyrenyl-actin. As the Tβ4-actin complex formed, Cw decreased linearly with the total concentration [T0] of Tβ4, according to the following equation:[TA]=Cw0−Cw=[T0]CCCC+KT(Eq. 2) in which [TA] is the concentration of Tβ4-actin complex; Cw0 and Cw are the mass concentrations of F-actin in the absence and presence of Tβ4, respectively; CC is the critical concentration for F-actin assembly; and KT is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the Tβ4-actin complex. The values of CC for actin and subtilisin-cleaved actin were independently derived from critical concentration plots. The value of KT was derived from the slope CC/(CC + KT) of the lines describing the linear decrease of Cw with [T0].Finally, the affinity of Tβ4 for actin and subtilisin-cleaved actin could also be derived from the inhibition of nucleotide exchange linked to Tβ4 binding. The CaATP-subtilisin-cleaved actin 1:1 complex was prepared by eliminating free ATP from the solution by Dowex-1 treatment (48Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5359-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and diluted to 2.2 μm in G buffer containing no nucleotide, 10 μm CaCl2 (final concentration), and variable amounts of Tβ4. At time 0, 5.8 μm ϵATP was added to the solution, and the rate of ϵATP exchange for bound ATP was derived from the increase in fluorescence of ϵATP associated to its binding to actin (λexc, 350 nm; λem, 410 nm). The process was mono-exponential, and the observed first order rate constant varied with the concentration of Tβ4, reflecting the binding of Tβ4 to subtilisin-cleaved actin in rapid equilibrium, as followskobs=K′Tk−+[T]k′−[T]+K′T(Eq. 3) where k- and k-′ are the rate constants for dissociation of CaATP from subtilisin-cleaved actin and Tβ4-subtilisin-cleaved actin complex, respectively; [T] is the concentration of free Tβ4; and KT′ is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the Tβ4-subtilisin-cleaved actin complex.Building of a Model of the Thymosin β4-actin G ComplexSoftware and Hardware—The X-PLOR (49Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Software, Version 3.1: A System for X-Ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) software was run on a Macintosh G4 PowerBook. The graphical analyses were performed using either MOLMOL (50Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6466) Google Scholar) run on a G4 PowerBook or Insight (Accelerys) run on an O2 Silicon Graphics work station.Model Building—The initial actin structure was extracted from the Protein Data Bank entry 1atn.pdb (51Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). A thymosin initial structure was built manually using the Builder module of Insight software. According to NMR results, a helical geometry was imposed to the Met6-Asp13 and Ile34-Ala40 segments, whereas the Lys18-Ser30 region was constrained to adopt an extended conformation. The φ and ψ angles of residues 5, 18, 31, and 32 were randomized, and the structure was submitted to a short torsion dynamic to eliminate eventual bad van der Waals interactions. Distances of 30 ± 10, 50 ± 10, and 55 ± 10 Å between residues 3 and 18, 18 and 38, and 3 and 38 were imposed during this first dynamic to obtain an initial structure already compatible with the previously identified cross-links between the peptide and G-actin (12De La Cruz E.M.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The two files were merged, and the thymosin was aligned and translated such that its main axis lies parallel to the actin plane at a distance of 30 Å above it.Three sets of constraints were designed to drive the formation of the complex. The first set was introduced to maintain the helical geometry of the thymosin 6-13 and 34-40 segments. It was composed of 12 HN-O (1.8-2.2Å) and N-O (1.8-3.2Å) distance restraints, enforcing the α-helices hydrogen bonds, and of 12 φ (47 ± 5°) and ψ (57 ± 5°) dihedral angle restraints. The second set was derived from cross-linking experiments. The Nϵ atoms of the thymosin Lys3, Lys18, and Lys38 were constrained to be in close vicinity (<5 Å) of the carboxylic functions of the actin Glu167 (Lys3), Asp1, or Glu4 (Lys18) and Glu41 (Lys38). In the case of Lys18 of thymosin, an ambiguous restraint was used to allow both possibilities. Finally, the last set was designed to impose close packing between the thymo"

We recently reported that eotaxin-3 is an antagonist for CCR2 (Ogilvie, P., Paoletti, S., Clark-Lewis, I., and Uguccioni, M. (2003) Blood 102, 789–784). In the present report, we provide evidence that eotaxin-3 acts as a natural antagonist on CCR1 and -5 as well. Eotaxin-3 bound to cells transfected with either CCR1 or -5 as well as to monocytes expressing both receptors. Further, it inhibited chemotaxis, the release of free intracellular calcium, and actin polymerization when cells were stimulated with known agonists of CCR1 and -5. An analysis of its three-dimensional structure indicated the presence of two distinct epitopes that may be involved in specific binding to CCR1, -2, -3, and -5. Taken together, our data thus indicate eotaxin-3 to be the first human chemokine that features broadband antagonistic activities, suggesting that it may have a modulatory rather than an inflammatory function. Further, eotaxin-3 may play an unrecognized role in the polarization of cellular recruitment by attracting Th2 lymphocytes as well as eosinophils and basophils via CCR3, while concomitantly blocking the recruitment of Th1 lymphocytes and monocytes via CCR1, -2, and -5.

Eotaxin-3 shares 36 and 32% of sequence homology to eotaxin and eotaxin-2, respectively, but is a less potent agonist of CCR3 (9Kitaura M. Suzuki N. Imai T. Takagi S. Suzuki R. Nakajima T. Hirai K.

Recently, the mRNA expression of eotaxin-3 was detected in dermal fibroblasts, implying a role in the pathogenesis of allergic and autoimmune diseases (12Dulkys Y. Schramm G. Kimmig D. Knoss S.

Antagonism of natural chemokines, as opposed to their known agonistic properties, has been described only recently. Such dual-activity chemokines would attract or activate a population of cells bearing one receptor, while at the same time preventing the recruitment and/or cellular activation of a different cellular population via another receptor. So far, six reports describe seven natural chemokine antagonists (13Blanpain C. Migeotte I. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M.

A thorough pharmacological characterization of CCR5 characterized MCP-3 (CCL7), a promiscuous agonist for CCR1, -2, and -3, as a highly potent CCR5 antagonist (13Blanpain C. Migeotte I. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Blood. 1999; 94: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another extensive study showed the interferon-inducible T cell α chemoattractant (CXCL11), an agonist of CXCR3, to be a highly selective and potent antagonist for CCR3 (15Loetscher P. Pellegrino A. Gong J.H. Mattioli I.I. Loetscher M. Bardi G. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 10: 10Google Scholar), whereas the monocyte/macrophage-activating IFN-γ-inducible protein (CXCL9) and the IFN-γ-inducible 10-kDa protein (CXCL10), the other two agonists of CXCR3, were less efficient inhibitors. More recently, eotaxin (CCL11) and eotaxin-3 (CCL26) have been reported to have antagonistic effects on CCR2 (16Ogilvie P. Bardi G. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2001; 97: 1920-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Ogilvie P. Paoletti S. Clark-Lewis I. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2003; 102: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Generally, understanding the natural antagonism of chemokines might help to clarify how one cell population gets recruited and activated, while at the same time another one is inhibited. Although in vivo experiments with natural antagonists have yet to be performed, synthetic and viral chemokine antagonists have proven to be effective already; N-terminally truncated MCP-1 (9–76) prevented the onset of disease and reduced symptoms and cellular infiltration in the MRL-lpr mouse model (19Gong J.H. Ratkay L.G. Waterfield J.D. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and truncated secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine prevented the development of graft versus host disease in mice (20Sasaki M. Hasegawa H. Kohno M. Inoue A. Ito M.R. Fujita S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). vMIP-II inhibited leukocyte infiltration, attenuated glomerulonephritis in Wistar-Kyioto rats (21Chen S. Bacon K.B. Li L.

Med. 1998; 188: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and inhibited virus-induced inflammation in mice (22Lindow M. Nansen A. Bartholdy C. Stryhn A. Hansen N.J. Boesen T.P. Wells T.N.

Taken together with our previous report (18Ogilvie P. Paoletti S. Clark-Lewis I. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2003; 102: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) about the antagonistic activity of eotaxin-3 on CCR2, eotaxin-3 would be the first broadband human chemokine antagonist, suggesting a modulatory rather than inflammatory role for this chemokine. Chemokine Synthesis—All chemokines were chemically synthesized using t-butoxycarbonyl solid-phase chemistry (23Clark-Lewis I. Vo L. Owen P. Anderson J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 287: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats of donor blood (Central Laboratory of the Swiss Red Cross, Basel, Switzerland) by Fycoll-Paque® density centrifugation. CD14+ monocytes were isolated by a positive immunoselection procedure (CD14 Micro Beads, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, cultured overnight in complete RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum to up-regulate CCR5, and confirmed to express CCR1 and -5 by flow cytometry. Stable transfection of human CCR1 and -5 into murine pre-B 300.19 cells was performed as described previously (16Ogilvie P. Bardi G. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2001; 97: 1920-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis Assays—Chemotaxis was assayed in 48-well Boyden microchambers (Neuro Probe Inc., Cabin John, MD) by using polyvinylpryrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes with 5-μm pores (Nucleopore). Briefly, attracting chemokines diluted in chemotaxis buffer (RPMI 1640, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% pasteurized plasma protein from the Swiss Red Cross Laboratory, Bern, Switzerland) were placed in the lower wells. In all inhibition experiments, eotaxin-3 was placed in the upper and lower wells. 5 × 104 monocytes/well or pre-B murine 300.19 cells/well singly transfected with CCR1 or -5 were resuspended in chemotaxis buffer. After 60 min of incubation for monocytes and 120 min of incubation for transfected cells, the membrane was removed, washed on the upper side with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and stained. Migrated cells were counted at 1000× magnification in five fields/well. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Data of dose-response experiments were fit to a sigmoidal function with variable slope using PRISM (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Chemokine Receptor Expression and Internalization—CCR1, -2, and -5 expression in monocytes cultured overnight was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan™, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cells were incubated for 30 min in FACS buffer (2% fetal calf serum, 0.1% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline) with anti-CCR1 (2D4, LeukoSite, Cambridge, MA), anti-CCR2b (MAB150, R&D Systems, UK), or anti-CCR5 (MAB181, R&D Systems). Calcium Transients—CCR1- or CCR5-transfected cells and monocytes were loaded in RPMI 1640 containing 20 mm Hepes and 5% fetal calf serum, with 0.16 nmol of fura-2/AM/million cells for 20 min. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was measured after single or sequential stimulation with chemokines by recording [Ca2+]i-related fluorescence changes (24von Tscharner V. Prod'hom B. Baggiolini M. Reuter H. Nature. 1986; 324: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Receptor internalization was assessed accordingly after a 45-min incubation at room temperature with 1 μm of either RANTES or eotaxin-3, respectively. Actin Polymerization—F-actin formation was determined with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals) in chemokine-stimulated CCR1- or CCR5-transfected cells and freshly isolated human monocytes. The reaction was stopped after 10 s, and cells were fixed with cold paraformaldehyde (4%) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min on ice. For experiments with consecutive exposure to two different chemokines, cells were pretreated with one chemokine for 3 min, exposed to the second chemokine, and fixed after 10 s as described above. After paraformaldehyde fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (6 μg/ml), and analyzed by FACS. All experiments were performed in duplicate. Relative F-actin formation was calculated as the percentage of agonist-induced and basal phalloidin staining (100%). Receptor Binding—Competition binding assays were performed with CCR1- or CCR5-transfected cells and monocytes using 2 × 106 cells in 120 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 20 mm Hepes and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.1. Cells were incubated on ice for 90 min with 0.15 nm 125I-MIP-1α (Amersham Biosciences) and competing chemokines as indicated. Non-bound radioactivity was separated by centrifugation through 6% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and cell-bound radioactivity was determined by γ-counting. The difference between total (radioligand only) and nonspecific binding (1000 nm unlabeled MIP-1α added) was taken as 100%. Data were analyzed with PRISM, using nonlinear regression in one- or two-site binding models. Protein Display and Analysis—Coordinates for eotaxin-3 (PDB code 1G2S), vMIP-II (PDB code 1VMP), MCP-2 (PDB code 1ESR), and MCP-3 (PDB code 1BO0) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Superposition fits and graphical analysis were performed in Swiss Pdb Viewer (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). The electrostatic potentials are shown according to Poisson-Boltzmann where blue designates basic (7Zhu Z. Ma B. Zheng T. Homer R.J. Lee C.G. Charo I.F. Noble P. Elias J.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2953-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) residues, and red designates acidic (-7) residues. Pairwise sequence alignments were performed using the standard settings of ClustalW, and multiple sequence alignments were performed using the global sequences without end-gap penalty settings of LALIGN at ch.EMBnet.org. As shown in Fig. 4, the asterisk designates identity, the colon designates high similarity (log score of 0 or greater in the default blosum matrix), and the period designates low similarity (log score of -1 or greater in the default blosum matrix) between amino acids. The term “conserved” is used throughout for log scores of -1 or greater between amino acids. Eotaxin-3 (CCL26) Inhibits Functional Responses Mediated by CCR1 and -5—Inhibition of free intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) changes induced by eotaxin-3 was measured in murine pre-B cells singly transfected with human CCR1 or -5, and in CCR1+/CCR5+ monocytes that had been cultured overnight. Cells were sequentially exposed to increasing concentrations of eotaxin-3 and to RANTES at concentrations sufficient to induce cellular responses. Eotaxin-3 inhibited responses to RANTES in a dose-dependent manner in all cell types. In transfected cells (Fig. 1, A and B), the response induced by 10 nm RANTES was partially inhibited by 300 nm eotaxin-3, whereas at 1 μm inhibition was complete. Eotaxin-3 was a more potent antagonist for CCR5, blocking the response almost completely at 300 nm. In monocytes stimulated with 30 nm RANTES (Fig. 1C), we observed substantial inhibition only after pretreatment with 1 μm eotaxin-3 but not with lower concentrations. The monocyte preparations used in these (and all subsequent) experiments were CCR1+ and CCR5+, and the simultaneous stimulation of the two receptors seems the likely explanation for the slightly reduced inhibitory potency of eotaxin-3 on these cells. To further characterize the antagonistic activity of eotaxin-3, we performed chemotaxis assays. In experiments with transfected cells, increasing concentrations of MIP-1α (a high potency agonist for CCR1 and -5) were added to the lower wells of the chemotaxis chamber. In the presence of 1 μm eotaxin-3 in the upper and lower wells, we observed almost complete inhibition of cell migration with CCR1-transfected (Fig. 1D) as well as CCR5-transfected cells (Fig. 1E). On transfected cells, eotaxin-3 alone had no chemotactic effects if applied to the upper, lower, or both wells. However and as we have reported previously (18Ogilvie P. Paoletti S. Clark-Lewis I. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2003; 102: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), eotaxin-3 actively repulses monocytes (but not receptor-transfected 300.19 cells) in vitro if an inverse gradient of eotaxin-3 is present. To avoid interference of this effect with inhibition of chemotaxis in monocytes (Fig. 1F), eotaxin-3 at 1 μm was added to the lower and upper wells of the chemotaxis chambers again. As with transfected cells, eotaxin-3 markedly reduced monocyte migration toward MIP-1α. The inhibitory effect was slightly less pronounced than in transfected cells. However, monocytes used were CCR1+ and CCR5+, which might readily account for the slightly higher migration observed. To confirm that eotaxin-3 itself does not induce any cell movement, eotaxin-3 was added alone to the upper and lower wells at 1 μm where it did not induce any cell migration above background (cell migration toward buffer). To estimate the dose of eotaxin-3 necessary to inhibit agonist-induced migration, an optimal concentration of MIP-1α was added to the lower wells of the chemotaxis chambers, and chemotaxis in the presence of increasing concentrations of eotaxin-3 assayed. In CCR1- and CCR5-transfected cells (Fig. 1, G and H), eotaxin-3 at 1 μm abolished cell migration in response to 10 nm MIP-1α almost completely. Eotaxin-3 inhibited CCR5 with a slightly higher potency than CCR1. Similar experiments with an optimal dose of 10 nm MIP-1α were performed using monocytes (Fig. 1I). As expected, eotaxin-3 reduced monocyte migration in a dose-dependent manner with a potency roughly intermediate between those observed for CCR1- and CCR5-transfected cells, probably again because of the cumulative effect of simultaneous stimulation of both receptors. The IC50 values calculated from these experiments are in the high nanomolar range with 622 and 254 nm for CCR1- and CCR5-transfected cells, and 175 nm for monocytes, respectively (see Table I, last row for a summary). The maximal inhibitions achieved with 1 μm eotaxin-3 were 88% (CCR1), 86% (CCR5), and 73% (monocytes).Table ISummary of binding and functional activities of CCR1/CCR5 ligands The pIC50 (-logm) values were obtained from competition binding using 125I-MIP-1α as a tracer (see Fig. 2). The pIC50 (-logm) values were obtained from functional dose-response curves using the chemotaxis assay (See Fig. 1, G–I).Cell typepIC50, MIP-1αpIC50, RANTESpIC50, eotaxin-3pIC50, eotaxin-3-logm ± S.D.300.19×CCR1-7.33 ± 0.04-6.05 ± 0.32-5.75 ± 0.41-6.21 ± 0.11300.19×CCR5-7.61 ± 0.13-8.64 ± 0.14-7.19 ± 0.15-6.60 ± 0.92Monocytes-7.44 ± 0.12-5.67 ± 0.21-6.42 ± 0.34-6.76 ± 0.08-7.83 ± 0.45 Open table in a new tab When cells encounter a chemokine gradient, they adopt a highly polarized morphology with a leading edge enriched in F-actin, allowing them to move efficiently through the gradient. To investigate whether eotaxin-3 can inhibit RANTES-induced actin polymerization in cells transfected with CCR1 or -5 and in monocytes, cells were stimulated with 10 nm RANTES (set to 100% for all experiments) or sequentially exposed to 1 μm eotaxin-3 and to 10 nm RANTES. For both CCR1- and CCR5-transfected cells, we observed inhibition of greater than 50% in the formation of F-actin after pretreatment with 1 μm eotaxin-3 (Fig. 1J). Of note, exposure to 1 μm eotaxin-3 alone did not induce any F-actin formation (not shown). Similarly, F-actin formation induced by 10 nm RANTES is inhibited by more than 50% in monocytes after pre-exposure to 1 μm eotaxin-3 (Fig. 1K, last bar). However, because of its repulsive activity, 1 μm eotaxin-3 by itself induces a strong response (Fig. 1K, fourth bar and Ref. 18Ogilvie P. Paoletti S. Clark-Lewis I. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2003; 102: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which drops to background levels within 3 min (Fig. 1K, fifth bar). To verify that the inhibition seen in monocytes is caused by receptor antagonism on CCR1 and -5 but not caused by depletion of the globular actin pool or heterologous receptor desensitization, we stimulated CCR2 with 10 nm of its selective agonist MCP-1 (Fig. 1K, first bar), which induces F-actin polymerization comparable with 10 nm RANTES and 1 μm eotaxin-3. Even though 10 nm MCP-1 stimulates monocytes in a more persistent way than 1 μm eotaxin-3 with measurable polymerization even after 3 min (Fig. 1K, second bar), cells remained fully responsive to a subsequent stimulation of CCR1 and -5 with 10 nm RANTES (Fig. 1K, third bar). Taken together, it seems likely that the inhibition of CCR1 and -5 by eotaxin-3 is in fact caused by direct receptor antagonism. Eotaxin-3 Binds to CCR1 and -5—One of the main features of natural antagonists is their binding to the receptors that they are inhibiting while failing to induce cellular responses. To characterize the binding of eotaxin-3 on CCR1 and -5 in transfected cells as well as in monocytes, we performed competition binding assays. Eotaxin-3 readily inhibited the binding of 125I-MIP-1α on CCR1- or CCR5-transfected cells and monocytes. In CCR1-transfected cells (Fig. 2A), eotaxin-3 displayed a 38- or 2-fold lower IC50 value compared with the value of the agonists MIP-1α and RANTES, with IC50 values of 47 nm for MIP-1α, 900 nm for RANTES, and 1770 nm for eotaxin-3, respectively. In CCR5-transfected cells, (Fig. 2B), eotaxin-3 bound with 3- or 28-fold lower IC50 values than the two agonists having IC50 values of 25 nm for MIP-1α, 2.3 nm for RAN-TES, and 64 nm for eotaxin-3, respectively. In monocytes (Fig. 2C), the binding data for RANTES were best fit to a two-site model, resulting in IC50 values of 15 and 2140 nm, whereas the data for both MIP-1α and eotaxin-3 fit best to a one-site model, with apparent IC50 values of 37 and 383 nm, respectively. Thus, eotaxin-3 displayed a 26-fold lower (high IC50 value site of RANTES), 10-fold lower (MIP-1α), and 6-fold higher (low IC50 value site of RANTES) binding than the two agonists tested (see Table I, first three rows for a summary). Eotaxin-3 Does Not Alter the Functional Response of Other Chemokine Receptors—To assess the specificity of eotaxin-3 as a natural antagonist, an additional nine murine pre-B cell lines, singly transfected with different human inflammatory or homing chemokine receptors, were tested for the antagonistic activity of eotaxin-3. Cells were left untreated or exposed to 1 μm eotaxin-3 and were sequentially stimulated with receptor-specific chemokines. As shown in Fig. 3, eotaxin-3 had no effect on any of the nine receptors, suggesting that the antagonistic activity of eotaxin-3 is specific for CCR1, -5, and -2 (18Ogilvie P. Paoletti S. Clark-Lewis I. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2003; 102: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Eotaxin-3 Is a Specific Natural Antagonist of CCR1, -2, and -5—Taken together, our data show that eotaxin-3 acts as a receptor antagonist on CCR1 and -5. Its antagonistic activity is confined to CCR1, -2 (18Ogilvie P. Paoletti S. Clark-Lewis I. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2003; 102: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and -5, as it did not display any effect on nine other chemokine receptors tested. Eotaxin-3 was able to reduce all functional responses of the monocytes and receptor-transfected 300.19 cells such as chemotaxis, [Ca2+]i release, and actin polymerization to minimal levels, and did not induce any receptor internalization (data not shown). As summarized in Table I, eotaxin-3 binds the two receptors on receptor-transfected cells and monocytes with IC50 values in the medium nanomolar (CCR5) to low micromolar (CCR1) range, whereas the functional IC50 values of eotaxin-3 for monocytes and transfected cells are in the high nanomolar range. Notably, on all cell types the binding IC50 values are in the lower part of (but within) the range of the two tested bona fide agonists. Collectively, our findings suggest that eotaxin-3 inhibits CCR5 by competitive receptor antagonism, because the IC50 values in binding and activity experiments correspond well as determined with CCR5-transfected cells. The report on the antagonism of eotaxin-3 on CCR2 (18Ogilvie P. Paoletti S. Clark-Lewis I. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2003; 102: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) would allow for a similar conclusion. The inhibitory effects of eotaxin-3 on CCR1 paint a somewhat different picture however. At 1 μm, eotaxin-3 completely inhibited chemotaxis and [Ca2+]i changes in CCR1-transfected cells despite the binding IC50 value of 1770 nm for eotaxin-3. Receptor occupancy at 1 μm would thus be rather low to account for complete inhibition, suggesting another currently unknown mechanism. Of note, similar results have been found independently (16Ogilvie P. Bardi G. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2001; 97: 1920-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Martinelli R. Sabroe I. LaRosa G. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42957-42964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) by the two groups that reported on the antagonism of eotaxin on CCR2. An alternative explanation would be inhibition by chemokine aggregation. Many chemokines form homodimers, and MIP-1α and -1β are known to form native heterodimers (27Guan E. Wang J. Norcross M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12404-12409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is feasible that in a hetero-complex composed of MIP-1α and eotaxin-3, eotaxin-3 might inhibit MIP-1α binding to (and activation of) CCR1 by direct physical contact. To test this hypothesis, we have performed immunoprecipitation experiments in conditions similar to the ones reported (27Guan E. Wang J. Norcross M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12404-12409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but have not found any evidence in favor of such a heterocomplex (results not shown). Hence, we exclude that eotaxin-3 inhibits the target receptors of MIP-1α by chemokine aggregation. To induce measurable inhibition, concentrations greater than 100 nm were required, with full inhibition observed at 1 μm eotaxin-3, raising the question of whether such concentrations can be achieved in a physiological setting. Lacking any information about in vivo concentrations of chemokines in general and of eotaxin-3 in particular, the inhibitory potential might best be compared with its agonistic potency in vitro.

NAT1 activity in the body is regulated by genetic polymorphisms as well as environmental factors such as substrate-dependent down-regulation and oxidative stress. Here we report the molecular mechanism for the low protein expression from mutant NAT1 alleles that gives rise to the slow acetylator phenotype and show that a similar process accounts for enzyme down-regulation by NAT1 substrates. NAT1 allozymes NAT1 14, NAT1 15, NAT1 17, and NAT1 22 are devoid of enzyme activity and have short intracellular half-lives (∼4 h) compared with wild-type NAT1 4 and the active allozyme NAT1 24. The inactive allozymes are unable to be acetylated by cofactor, resulting in ubiquitination and rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome. This was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the active site cysteine 68. The NAT1 substrate p-aminobenzoic acid induced ubiquitination of the usually stable NAT1 4, leading to its rapid degradation. From this study, we conclude that NAT1 exists in the cell in either a stable acetylated state or an unstable non-acetylated state and that mutations in the NAT1 gene that prevent protein acetylation produce a slow acetylator phenotype.

Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) 1The abbreviations used are: NAT1, N-acetyltransferase 1; PABA, p-aminobenzoic acid; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1; HA, hemagglutinin. (EC 2.3.1.5) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the N-acetylation of many arylamine and hydrazine xenobiotics. It also appears to be important in the catabolism of folic acid, where it acetylates p-aminobenzoylglutamate following cleavage of the folate molecule (1Minchin R.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Ward A. Summers M.J. Sim E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The gene that encodes NAT1 is located at 8 p 21-22 and exhibits genetic as well as functional polymorphisms (reviewed in Refs. 3Butcher N.J. Boukouvala S. Sim E. Minchin R.F. Pharmacogenomics J. 2002; 2: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 4Hein D.W. Doll M.A. Fretland A.J. Leff M.A. Webb S.J. Xiao G.H. Devanboyina U.S. Nangju N.A. Feng Y. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 2000; 9: 29-42PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous NAT1 alleles have been identified but only a small number result in altered activity in vivo (5Hughes N.C. Janezic S.A. McQueen K.L. Jewett M.A. Castranio T. Bell D.A. Grant D.M. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Butcher N.J. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, Fretland et al. (7Fretland A.J. Doll M.A. Leff M.A. Hein D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) showed that the NAT1 allozymes that have reduced catalytic activity (NAT1*14, NAT1*15, NAT1*17, and NAT1*22) compared with wild-type (NAT1*4) are expressed at barely detectable levels in yeast. Because the rate of gene transcription did not appear to differ between alleles, they concluded that a decrease in protein translation and/or protein turnover was responsible for the very low levels of expression. Interestingly, NAT1-specific substrates such as p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and p-aminosalicylic acid down-regulate enzyme activity by a mechanism that leads to a decrease in NAT1 protein (8Butcher N.J. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Again, the loss of protein appeared to occur at a post-transcriptional level because the drugs did not affect NAT1 mRNA levels. More recently, NAT1 activity has been shown to be affected by oxidative stress such as exposure to hydrogen peroxide or S-nitrosothiols (9Atmane N. Dairou J. Paul A. Dupret J.M. Rodrigues-Lima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35086-35092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Dairou J. Atmane N. Dupret J.M. Rodrigues-Lima F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Despite these observations indicating that NAT1 is regulated at both an environmental and a genetic level, the molecular mechanisms responsible are poorly understood. The acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)-dependent acetylation reaction catalyzed by NAT1 proceeds via a classical ping-pong bi bi mechanism (11Weber W.W. Cohen S.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 266-273PubMed Google Scholar, 12Steinberg M.S. Cohen S.N. Weber W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Initially, the active site cysteine (Cys 68 for human NAT1) of the enzyme accepts an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA, forming a thiol ester. The second step involves the binding of substrate to the acetylated enzyme, transfer of the acetyl group to the substrate, and release of the acetylated product. The initial acetylation of NAT1 can proceed independent of the presence of substrate (13Riddle B. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3250-3258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Turnover of acetylated enzyme in the absence of substrate is relatively slow, probably because of the exclusion of water from the active site, which is buried below the surface of the protein (14Sinclair J.C. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, turnover is increased in the presence of substrate, suggesting that a change in equilibrium from an acetylated to a non-acetylated form may occur. We hypothesized that NAT1 exists in the cell in either a stable acetylated state or an unstable non-acetylated state. Thus, substrates induce down-regulation by shifting the equilibrium of the protein toward the non-acetylated state. This mechanism could also explain the apparent instability of the allozymes expressed from alleles that give rise to the slow acetylator phenotype if these proteins exist predominantly in the non-acetylated state. To investigate this, we examined the half-life of a number of NAT1 allozymes previously reported to have little or no activity and compared these to the wild-type NAT1 4. Here we report that the mutant allozymes were not acetylated by acetyl-CoA. Moreover, these proteins were rapidly ubiquitinated in cultured cells. We also show that the NAT1 substrate PABA can induce ubiquitination of NAT1 4, leading to its degradation. We conclude that the acetylation status of the active site cysteine determines the stability of the NAT1 protein in vivo and propose that this is the molecular mechanism responsible for the slow acetylator phenotype of the alleles investigated in this study. In addition, substrate-dependent down-regulation of human NAT1 occurs because of enzyme deacetylation and subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway. Cell Culture—HT-29 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and benzylpenicillin (80 μg/ml). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Isolation of PBMC, Total RNA Extraction, and NAT1 Genotyping of cDNA—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll-Paque as described previously (6Butcher N.J. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from PBMC using a High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science) and reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)15 (Promega). The NAT1 open reading frame was amplified from cDNA using NAT1-specific primers and genotyped for NAT1*14 and NAT1*17 as described previously (6Butcher N.J. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cloning of NAT1 Alleles—The protein coding regions of NAT1*14 and NAT1*17 were amplified by PCR from DNA of heterozygous individuals using forward primer 5′-CCTTGCTTGGATCCTCATGGACATTGAAGC-3′ (BamHI) and reverse primer 5′-ACTCCGAATTCTAAATAGTAAAA-3′ (EcoRI) and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEF1/His (Invitrogen). The protein coding regions of NAT1*22 and NAT1*24 were amplified from plasmids generously provided by Dr. H. Lin (University of California) using the above primers and cloned into pEF1/His. Plasmid containing wild-type NAT1 (pEF1/His-NAT1*4) was kindly provided by Prof. E. Sim (University of Oxford). The NAT1-C68Y construct was prepared by amplifying the open reading frame of NAT1*4 as two fragments using the above forward primer and reverse primer 5′-ATGATTGACCTGGAGGTACCATCCAC-3′ (KpnI) and forward primer 5′-GTGGATGGTACCTCCAGGTC-3′ (KpnI) and the above reverse primer. The PCR fragments were digested with KpnI, ligated together, amplified by PCR with the primers used to amplify NAT1*14, and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pEF1/His vector. NAT1*4, NAT1*14, NAT1*17, NAT1*22, NAT1*24, and NAT1-C68Y were amplified by PCR from the pEF1/His constructs using forward primer 5′-TCCGGAATTCAATGGACATTGAAGC-3′ (EcoRI) and reverse primer 5′-CGCGGATCCTAAATAGTAAAAAATC-3′ (BamHI) and cloned into the mammalian expression vector p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma). The truncated variant NAT1*15 was prepared by PCR as above using pEF1/His-NAT1*4 as template and reverse primer 5′-CGCGGATCCTAGTATTTGCTGTC-3′ (BamHI). Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Determination of Intracellular NAT1 Half-life—HT-29 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well (24-well plate) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were transfected in the absence of fetal bovine serum with 1 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the culture medium was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml/well fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and the cells incubated for a further 20 h at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and harvested at times 0, 4, and 8 h post-treatment. Cells were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS, resuspended in 0.8 ml of 20 mm Tris/1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, and disrupted on ice using a cell sonicator (Branson Sonifier B250; duty cycle 100%, output = 5; 3 × 5 s bursts). Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 3 min at 16,000 × g (4 °C) and the supernatant retained for Western blot and assay of NAT1 activity. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). NAT1 Activity Assay—NAT1 activities were quantified by HPLC as described previously using the NAT1-selective substrate PABA (8Butcher N.J. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted using a polyclonal NAT1-specific antibody (kindly provided by Prof. E. Sim, University of Oxford) as described previously (6Butcher N.J. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or an anti-FLAG-M2 HRP antibody (A 8592; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NAT1 was visualized using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Protein content was estimated from Western blots by densitometry using ImageQuant Ver. 1.1 (Amersham Biosciences). Synthesis of [3H]Acetyl-CoA—Coenzyme A (5 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of ammonium hydroxide (100 mm). On ice, [3H]acetic anhydride (18.5 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added dropwise with mixing until the reaction was complete, as assessed by thiol assay using 3-carboxy-4-nitrophenyl disulfide (Sigma). The reaction mixture was purified on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp.) and eluted in 0.5 ml of methanol. The methanol was evaporated at 37 °C under a gentle stream of N2 and the [3H]acetyl-CoA residue reconstituted in 0.5 ml of water. Radiochemical purity assessed by HPLC was >85%, and there was a single major peak that co-chromatographed with authentic acetyl-CoA. The major contaminant was acetic acid. Expression and Purification of Recombinant NAT1 in Escherichia coli—The open reading frame of NAT1*4, NAT1*24, the slow acetylator alleles NAT1*14, NAT1*15, NAT1*17, and NAT1*22 and the inactive NAT1-C68Y were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-6P-2 and introduced into the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RP (Stratagene) by electroporation. Cultures (4 liters of Luria Bertani containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml tetracycline, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin) were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.8 and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at room temperature. Bacteria were harvested (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and the pellets resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl at pH 8.0 containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I) and lysed using a French press. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the soluble fraction collected. The GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (G 4510; Sigma) and the relative amounts of protein estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. NAT1 Acetylation Assay—Recombinant GST·NAT1 fusion proteins (10 μg) bound to GSH-agarose beads (Sigma) were incubated with 6.7 μm [3H] acetyl-CoA (specific activity = 9.25 GBq/mmol) in PBS at 37 °C for 2 h. The beads were recovered by filtration on 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore), washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, and radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. GST bound to GSH-agarose beads was included to measure nonspecific binding. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. MG132 Treatment and Immunoprecipitation—HT-29 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well (6-well plate) and co-transfected with 1 μg of pFLAG-NAT1 plasmid and 1 μg of pcDNA-HA-ubiquitin plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were treated with MG132 (20 μm, Calbiochem) or vehicle (Me2SO) for 8 h and then washed twice with 1 ml of PBS and harvested by scraping into 0.8 ml of 20 mm Tris/1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture (P 8340; Sigma). Cells were disrupted on ice by sonication and the supernatants cleared by centrifugation for 3 min at 16,000 × g (4 °C). Anti-FLAG-M2 monoclonal antibody (10 μg, F 3165; Sigma) was added, and the supernatants were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein G-Sepharose 4B (P 3296; Sigma) was then added and the lysates incubated for a further 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and the beads washed three times with PBS. The recovered proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted using either anti-FLAG-M2 HRP antibody (Sigma) or anti-HA antibody (H 6908; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NAT1 Protein levels Are Diminished in PBMC from Slow Acetylator Individuals—Previously, we and others have shown that individuals heterozygous for either the NAT1*14B or NAT1*17 slow acetylator alleles had approximately half the NAT1 activity of individuals who were homozygous wild-type (NAT1*4) (5Hughes N.C. Janezic S.A. McQueen K.L. Jewett M.A. Castranio T. Bell D.A. Grant D.M. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here, we show by Western blot that PBMC lysates from individuals heterozygous for either NAT1*14B or NAT1*17 have lower levels of immunodetectable NAT1 protein compared with individuals who are homozygous wild-type (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the lower protein levels correlated with a lower enzyme activity (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the slow acetylator phenotype results from a reduction in the amount of NAT1. To determine whether the NAT1*14B and NAT1*17 alleles were expressed in vivo, cDNA isolated from PBMC obtained from homozygous and heterozygous individuals was genotyped as described previously (6Butcher N.J. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Genotyping showed the presence of both variant forms of mRNA, indicating that each variant allele was expressed in vivo (Fig. 1C). Expression and Activity of NAT1 Proteins in HT-29 Cells—To determine protein expression and activity of the variant NAT1 proteins, each allele in the pEF1/His vector was transiently transfected into the human colon carcinoma cell line, HT-29. Western blots using a NAT1-specific antibody (Fig. 2A) showed that His-tagged wild-type NAT1, as well as all of the variant His-NAT1 proteins (36 kDa), were expressed at levels greater than endogenous NAT1 (33 kDa). Cells expressing the slow acetylator His-NAT1 proteins had NAT1 activities that were not significantly different (p >0.05) from the endogenous NAT1 activity of HT-29 cells (5.7 ± 0.1 nmol/min/mg protein), indicating that these variant proteins are catalytically inactive, at least when PABA is used as substrate (Fig. 2B). Cells expressing His-NAT1 4 and His-NAT1 24 had enzymatic activities of 122 ± 1.2 and 130 ± 2.3 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively, which was more than 20-fold higher than the endogenous activity of HT-29 cells. Stability of NAT1 Proteins in HT-29 Cells—To determine the stability of the different NAT1 allozymes in vivo, HT-29 cells were transiently transfected with the various pEF1/His-NAT1 constructs, treated with cycloheximide for up to 8 h, and analyzed by Western blotting using a NAT1-specific antibody (Fig. 3A). The His-tagged NAT1 proteins were ∼3 kDa larger than endogenous NAT1, so the endogenous protein did not interfere with the protein stability measurements. Endogenous NAT1 4, His-NAT1 4, and the rapid acetylator protein His-NAT1 24 had similar stabilities with no noticeable degradation occurring over the 8-h time period of the experiment (Fig. 3B). In fact, no significant degradation of His-NAT1 4 occurred over a 24-h time period of cycloheximide treatment, indicating that the half-life of the wild-type protein is in excess of 24 h (data not shown). These results show that the active allozymes were stable in vivo and that the His tag did not decrease protein stability. By contrast, all the slow acetylator (inactive) proteins were considerably less stable, having half-lives of between 2 and 4 h (Fig. 3B). The truncated slow acetylator protein NAT1 15 lacks the epitope for the NAT1-specific antibody used in these studies, so it was cloned into an N-terminal FLAG-tag vector so that its half-life could be determined using a FLAG-specific antibody. To ensure the FLAG tag did not affect protein stability, FLAG-NAT1*4 and FLAG-NAT1*17 also were constructed for comparison (Fig. 3A, lower panels). The half-lives of FLAG-NAT1 4 and FLAG-NAT1 17 were similar to their His-tagged counterparts, indicating that the tag had no appreciable effect on protein stability (Fig. 3B). The half-life of FLAG-NAT1 15 was less than 4 h (Fig. 3B), which was similar to that observed for the other slow acetylator NAT1 proteins. The results of the FLAG-tag experiments also show that the loss of NAT1 protein observed using the NAT1-specific antibody raised against the last 11 amino acids of NAT1 (16Stanley L.A. Coroneos E. Cuff R. Hickman D. Ward A. Sim E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was not because of loss of the epitope because FLAG-NAT1 17 (N-terminal tag) and His-NAT1 17 both had similarly short half-lives compared with wild-type. Acetylation Capacity of NAT1 Allozymes—To determine whether the inactive NAT1 proteins produced by the slow acetylator alleles were acetylated by acetyl-CoA, GST·NAT1 fusion proteins were incubated with [3H]acetyl-CoA, and the radioactivity associated with the proteins was determined. The active allozymes GST·NAT1 4 and GST·NAT1 24 bound ∼100 pmol [3H]/nmol protein, whereas all the inactive proteins bound less than 10% of that seen with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). The lack of binding was not because of a lack of protein expression, determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 4). Taken together with the protein stability data above, these results suggest that NAT1 in the non-acetylated state is rapidly degraded in the cell. Stability of NAT1-C68Y Mutant in HT-29 Cells—To further investigate the effect of acetylation on NAT1 stability, the active site cysteine 68 was mutated to a tyrosine to prevent formation of a thiol ester with acetyl-CoA. This construct (pEF1/His-NAT1-C68Y) was transfected into HT-29 cells, and stability was determined using cycloheximide treatment. As expected, the expressed protein did not acetylate PABA (data not shown), and when expressed as a GST fusion it did not bind [3H]acetyl-CoA (Fig. 5A). The level of expression and stability of His-NAT1-C68Y was similar to that observed for the other inactive His-NAT1 proteins (Fig. 5, B and C). These results further support the postulation that the non-acetylated form of NAT1 is susceptible to rapid degradation in the cell. Role of the Ubiquitin/26 S Proteasome Pathway in NAT1 Degradation—To determine whether the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway was involved in the rapid degradation of the slow acetylator (inactive) NAT1 proteins, the effect of the 26 S proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 on the intracellular half-life of the unstable FLAG-NAT1 17 was investigated. HT-29 cells were transiently transfected with pFLAG-NAT1*17 and treated with cycloheximide for up to 8 h. In the absence of MG132, FLAG-NAT1 17 was rapidly degraded (Fig. 6A, left panel). However, when MG132 (20 μm) was added concurrently with the cycloheximide, the stability of the variant protein increased significantly with little protein loss occurring over the 8-h time period of the experiment (Fig. 6A, right panel). Furthermore, when the experiment was conducted in the absence of cycloheximide, treatment with MG132 (20 μm) for 8 h resulted in the appearance of higher molecular mass bands, consistent with ubiquitination of FLAG-NAT1 17 (Fig. 6B). Higher molecular mass bands also were observed for the other inactive NAT1 variant proteins but less so for the active variant protein FLAG-NAT1 24 and the wild-type protein FLAG-NAT1 4 (Fig. 6B). We next co-expressed each of the FLAG-tagged allozymes and FLAG-NAT1-C68Y with a HA-tagged ubiquitin construct to identify ubiquitination of the NAT1 proteins. Following treatment with MG132 and immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, Western blotting with anti-HA antibody showed specific polyubiquitination of the unstable NAT1 proteins (Fig. 6C), whereas the stable NAT1 24 and NAT1 4 proteins were polyubiquitinated to a much lesser extent. Moreover, when cells expressing FLAG-NAT1 4 and HA-ubiquitin were treated with PABA, significantly more polyubiquitination of the immunoprecipitated protein was evident (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these results show that the unstable NAT1 allozymes and the non-acetylated stable NAT1 protein are targeted to the 26 S proteasome pathway by polyubiquitination. Point mutations in the NAT1 locus result in a slow acetylator phenotype that is observed in ∼5% of Caucasians and up to 25% in a Lebanese population (6Butcher N.J. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F.

(7Fretland A.J. Doll M.A. Leff M.A. Hein D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reveals two possible causes for the slow acetylator phenotype in humans. First, they observed negligible expression of some alleles and suggested translational efficiency may be important. Second, they observed more rapid heat inactivation of some mutant proteins and suggested intracellular stability also may be important. In this study, we have shown that mutant proteins are rapidly polyubiquitinated and targeted for degradation via the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway. Moreover, degradation correlates with the non-acetylated state of the allozyme. For two of the alleles (NAT1*14 and NAT1*17), protein instability also was demonstrated in PBMC from heterozygous individuals. From these studies, we propose the reaction model shown in Fig. 7. NAT1 is acetylated in vivo to a stable form. Hydrolysis of the acetyl-NAT1 is relatively slow but can be enhanced by substrate that removes the acetyl moiety from the protein. Mutant proteins that do not catalyze the formation of an acetyl thiol ester exist in the non-acetylated state, which is ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation. This model explains the low protein levels seen with slow acetylator individuals and the instability of mutant proteins reported here and elsewhere (7Fretland A.J. Doll M.A. Leff M.A. Hein D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, it provides a plausible mechanism for the substrate-specific down-regulation of NAT1 reported earlier (8Butcher N.J. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and confirmed in the present study. The present observations are restricted to the specific slow acetylator alleles studied (NAT1*14, NAT1*15, NAT1*17, and NAT1*22). However, very low levels of translated protein were also observed in yeast for NAT1*19 (7Fretland A.J. Doll M.A. Leff M.A. Hein D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that this mutant protein also may undergo ubiquitination. There are clear similarities between NAT1 instability and the NAT2 slow acetylator phenotype described for some allelic variants. In humans homozygous for NAT2*5A or NAT2*6A, there is a decrease in immunodetectable protein present in the liver (20Meyer U.A. Zanger U.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 269-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether NAT2 protein levels in vivo can also be regulated by ubiquitination or down-regulated by selective substrates. NAT1 possesses a catalytic triad active site (14Sinclair J.C. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Rodrigues-Lima F. Delomenie C. Goodfellow G.H. Grant D.M. Dupret J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 327-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, it is similar to many cysteine proteases such as the caspases, transglutaminases, and deubiquitinases. The active site is located within a cleft that may serve to exclude water from the catalytic domain protecting the acetyl thiol ester at Cys-68 from hydrolysis. Recently, Mushtaq et al. (22Mushtaq A. Payton M. Sim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12175-12181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that the C-terminal sequence of NAT from Salmonella typhimurium controls hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA. Normally, the protein is stably acetylated, and therefore net hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA is negligible. In the absence of the C terminus, the acetyl protein is rapidly deacetylated and thus able to continually catalyze the conversion of acetyl-CoA to coenzyme A. When the C terminus was removed and expressed in bacteria, the resulting truncated NAT was toxic, possibly because of depletion of intracellular acetyl-CoA. If a similar mechanism occurs in humans, then rapid degradation of non-acetylated protein may be a protective mechanism against excessive hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA. The results from the present study indicated that the slow acetylator phenotype is due to an inactive protein that is rapidly degraded within the cell, at least for NAT1 14, NAT1 15, NAT1 17, and NAT1 22. They also demonstrated that substrate-dependent down-regulation is due to rapid degradation of the enzyme via the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway. The different mutations in NAT1 that give rise to an inactive protein change single amino acids located at different sites throughout the enzyme. For NAT1 15, the mutation introduces a stop codon and the protein is truncated at amino acid 186. The common feature for each of the slow acetylator enzymes is their inability to stably exist as an acetyl protein. The NAT1-C68Y mutant confirmed the difference in stability of the acetylated and non-acetylated proteins. Moreover, addition of substrate (PABA), which would be expected to shift the equilibrium between acetylated and non-acetylated enzyme toward the non-acetylated state, induced polyubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation. These data suggest that acetylation of Cys-68 may prevent access of ubiquitinases to target lysine residues. Because NAT1 15 was ubiquitinated in a similar manner as the other mutant proteins, the lysine residue(s) most likely reside in the first 186 N-terminal amino acids. In this region, there are seven lysines, two (Lys-13 and Lys-14) are adjacent to a putative D-box (RXXL) that has been described as necessary for the degradation of many cell cycle-dependent proteins (23Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, preliminary mutagenesis of these residues did not appear to affect ubiquitination. 2A. Arulpragasam and N. Butcher, unpublished data. Further mutagenesis work is underway to identify the crucial lysine(s) involved in NAT1 degradation. Under conditions where substrates are not present, NAT1 will exist in equilibrium between an acetylated and non-acetylated state. From the reaction mechanism (Fig. 7), the equilibrium is determined by the concentration of acetyl-CoA within the cell. The very long half-life of NAT1 4 (>24 h) suggests that the majority of the protein is acetylated in vivo. A shift in equilibrium because of a change in cofactor levels will lead to an increase or decrease in the amount of NAT1 present in the cell. In this manner, NAT1 may behave as a sensor of acetyl-CoA levels. However, further investigation is required to determine the relationship, if any, between acetyl-CoA and NAT1 levels. Recently, Dupret and co-workers (9Atmane N. Dairou J. Paul A. Dupret J.M. Rodrigues-Lima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35086-35092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Dairou J. Atmane N. Dupret J.M. Rodrigues-Lima F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have shown that oxidation of the active site cysteine of NAT1 reversibly inhibits enzymatic activity. However, it is not known whether this modification affects protein stability in vivo by altering the acetylation status of NAT1. The differential stability of wild-type NAT1 and mutant NAT1 proteins is similar to that observed for wild-type human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and the mutant protein NQO1 2. Anwar et al. (24Anwar A. Siegel D. Kepa J.K. Ross D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14060-14067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that the molecular chaperone Hsp70, which catalyzes protein folding, associates with the wild-type protein but not with the mutant protein NQO1 2. It has been proposed that the amino acid change in NQO1 2 disrupts the central parallel β-sheet, resulting in a decreased affinity for cofactor. Anwar et al. suggest that the lack of association of Hsp70 with NQO1 2 may be because of its inability to bind cofactor. It is plausible that a similar mechanism exists for the mutant NAT1 proteins, where their inability to bind the cofactor acetyl-CoA (demonstrated in the present study) prevents their association with chaperone proteins such as Hsp70 and leads to incomplete protein folding and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. This also may explain how mutations located throughout the NAT1 gene that change single amino acids spatially distinct from the active site all lead to the production of an inactive, rapidly degraded protein. Further study is required to determine whether Hsp70 or any other chaperone proteins interact with NAT1. In summary, the present study provides experimental evidence to support a molecular mechanism that may explain the low level of protein expression from mutant NAT1 alleles. In addition, it also may explain how substrates for NAT1 can induce protein down-regulation and, therefore, modification of NAT1 activity in vivo. The role of the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway in regulating NAT1 levels has not previously been described for this or related protein families."

CD95-Tyr phosphorylation is a prerequisite for CD95 membrane trafficking and formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). The mechanisms underlying the hyperosmotic EGFR activation in hepatocytes has remained unclear, however, the process is antioxidant- and genistein-sensitive, suggestive of the involvement of tyrosine kinases as upstream events (10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar). Recent studies in non-hepatic cell lines point to an activation of the Src kinase family member Fyn by severe hyperosmotic stress, which may result in an increased phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (11Sanguinetti A.R.

Recent studies on vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells indicated an involvement of c-Src, but not of Fyn, in the JNK activation in response to oxidative stress (15Yoshizumi M. Abe J.

The present study was undertaken to identify the putative tyrosine kinase that is involved in hyperosmotic EGFR activation in hepatocytes and to elucidate its role in the proapoptotic action of hyperosmotic hepatocyte shrinkage. The data show that mild hyperosmotic exposure results in an activation of Fyn, Yes, and Lck. Yes, but not Fyn, associates with the EGFR, triggering its activation and, finally, DISC formation. Materials—The materials used were purchased as follows: collagenases from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany); William's E medium from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany); penicillin/streptomycin from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany); fetal calf serum from Invitrogen; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nut.mix F-12, LipofectAMINE 2000 and pTOPO-TA vector from Invitrogen; TUNEL assay from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Soluble CD95-ligand (CD95L) was obtained from Alexis Corp. (Grünberg, Germany) and was always employed with 10-fold amount of enhancer protein (as provided by the supplier). SU6656, PP-2, herbimycin A, emodin, AG1478, and H89 were from Calbiochem. The antibodies used were purchased as follows: rabbit anti-CD95, mouse anti-green fluorescent protein (which cross-reacts with YFP), rabbit anti-FADD and mouse anti-caspase 8 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-phospho Lck56, rabbit anti-phospho-Src family-Y418, and mouse anti-phospho Erk1/2 antibodies from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); mouse anti-phospho-Src-Y418 and rabbit anti-phospho-Src-Y529 antibodies from Calbiochem; goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany); rabbit anti-phospho-JNK-1/-2 and rabbit anti-phospho-EGFR antibodies from BioSource Int.

All other chemicals were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) at the highest quality available. Plasmid Construction—The nucleotide sequence encoding the CD95 receptor was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using HepG2 mRNA as template with the following primers: 5′-GTC GAC CAC TTC GGA TTG CTC AAC-3′ and 5′-CTC TAG ACT AGA CCA AGC TTT GGA TTT C-3′. The resulting 1-kb fragment was ligated into the pTOPO-TA vector to proceed pTOPO-TA-CD95. For construction of CD95-YFP, PCR-directed mutagenesis was performed in the template pTOPO-TA-CD95R using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-TGC TCG AGA TGC TGG GCA TCT GGA CCC TCC TAC CT-3′ and 5′-CGG TAC CGT CGA CAC CAA GCT TTG GAT TTC ATT TCT-3′ to remove the stop codon of CD95 and introduce a XhoI site on the 5′-end and a KpnI on the 3′-end. The KpnI-XhoI fragment of CD95 was subsequently inserted into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to create a receptor fusion protein with YFP linked to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The construct was confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Cell Preparation and Culture—Hepatocytes were isolated from livers of male Wistar rats, which were fed ad libitum with a standard diet, by a collagenase perfusion technique as described previously (9Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 602-614Google Scholar, 10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar). Aliquots of 1.5 × 106 cells were plated on collagen-coated 6-well culture plates (Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany) and cultured as published recently (9Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar) for 24 h, unless indicated otherwise, before the experiments were started. The viability of the hepatocytes was more than 95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Human hepatoma cell line 7 (Huh7) cells (19Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Yamane T. Miyazaki M. Miyano K. Sato J. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1984; 75: 151-158Google Scholar) were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2-atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nut.mix F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, resulting in a final osmolarity of 305 mosm as measured using a cryoscopic osmometer (Osmomat 030, Gonotec, Berlin, Germany). Cells were grown to 70% confluency before transient transfection using expression vectors of the CD95-YFP fusion protein supplemented with LipofectAMINE 2000 culture medium without antibiotics. Osmolarity changes were performed by appropriate addition or removal of NaCl from the medium. Yes and EGFR Protein Knockdown—Antisense oligonucleotides directed to the Src kinase family member Yes or EGFR and the corresponding controls (i.e. nonsense oligonucleotides) were designed and manufactured by Biognostik (Göttingen, Germany). Immediately after hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated culture plates (Ø 6 cm, Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany) at a density of 4 × 106 cells/plate, either 4 μm of the respective oligonucleotides (nonsense, Yes-antisense) supplemented with LipofectAMINE 2000 or 2 μm of nonsense or EGFR-antisense oligonucleotides without cationic lipids, respectively, were instituted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Thereafter, cells were kept in culture for up to 4 days. In control experiments, uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled nonsense oligonucleotides (2 μm) was already visible after 1 h of incubation and lasted for up to 4 days. Western Blot Analysis—At the end of the incubation periods, medium was removed and cells were washed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline and immediately lysed. Samples were transferred to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were then blotted to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) as recently described (9Reinehr R. Graf D.

Blots were blocked for 2 h in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin-containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with the first antibody (antibodies used: anti-phospho-JNK-1/-2 and anti-phospho-Src family-Y418 (1:1,000); anti-Yes, anti-Fyn, and anti-phospho-Lck56 (1: 1,250); anti-phospho-EGFR and anti-phospho-Src-Y418 and -Y529 (1: 2,500); anti-EGFR and anti-phospho-Erk-1/-2 (1:5,000); and anti-CD95, anti-FADD, anti-caspase 8, and anti-phospho-tyrosine (all 1:10,000)). Following washing with TBS-T and incubating with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse, anti-sheep, or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (all diluted 1:10,000) at room temperature for 2 h, respectively, the blots were washed extensively and developed using enhanced chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were exposed to X-Omat AR-5 film (Eastman Kodak). Immunoprecipitation—Hepatocytes or Huh7 cells, respectively, were cultured on collagen-coated culture plates (Ø 10 cm; Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany) at a density of 8 × 106 cells/plate. They were harvested in lysis buffer containing 136 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mm Pefabloc, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The lysates were kept for 10 min on ice and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, and aliquots were taken for protein determination using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). The supernatants containing equal protein amounts (200 μg) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a polyclonal rabbit anti-CD95, rabbit anti-Yes, or rabbit anti-Fyn antibody (dilution 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to immunoprecipitate CD95, Yes, or Fyn from rat hepatocytes or were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a monoclonal mouse anti-green fluorescent protein antibody (dilution 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to immunoprecipitate the transfected CD95-YFP fusion protein in Huh7 cells, respectively. Then 10 μl of protein A-agarose and 10 μl of protein-G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with a buffer containing 136 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mm Pefabloc, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then transferred to Western blot analysis as described above. The anti-phospho-Src family-Y418 antibody was used to detect activating phosphorylation of Yes or Fyn in the respective immunoprecipitates (20Piiper A. Elez R. You S.J. Kronenberger B. Loitsch S. Roche S. Zeuzem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7065-7072Google Scholar), whereas Yes or Fyn/EGFR association was detected using an anti-EGFR-antibody in the latter samples. EGFR, FADD, and caspase 8 association or tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated CD95 samples were detected by Western blot analysis using the respective antibodies (anti-EGFR, -FADD, -caspase 8, and -phospho-tyrosine). CD95 Membrane Trafficking—For determination of membrane surface trafficking of CD95 in primary rat hepatocytes, cells were cultured for 24 h on collagen-coated glass coverslips (Ø 30 mm) in 6-well culture plates (Falcon). Permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells were stained as published recently (9Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 602-614Google Scholar, 10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar), using a polyclonal rabbit anti-CD95 antibody (dilution 1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline) and a secondary anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody. Cells were visualized using an Axioskop (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and pictures were taken with a 3CCD camera (Intas, Göttingen, Germany). Receptor membrane trafficking was defined as the appearance of fluorescent spotting on the surface of the non-permeabilized cells compared with the non-permeabilized control cells (9Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 602-614Google Scholar, 10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar). For each condition, a blinded observer scored at least 100 cells per independent experiment from at least three different cell preparations for CD95-membrane trafficking. For determination of membrane surface trafficking of CD95-YFP in Huh7, cells were transfected as described above and plated on glass bottom dishes (Mattek, Ashland, MA). Confocal pictures were taken using the LSM 510 META (Zeiss). YFP was excited with 514 nm. 24 h after transfection CD95-YFP was detected in living cells. At least 100 cells from three independent experiments were counted in a humidified 5% CO2-atmosphere at 37 °C. CD95 translocation was also studied by detecting the total CD95 amount in cytosolic and membrane fractions using Western blot analysis. For this, cells were plated on collagen-coated culture plates (Ø 10 cm) at a density of 8 × 106 cells/plate and were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 30 mm mannitol, and 10 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.5). After centrifugation of the samples (5 min, 1,200 × g), the supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation (35 min, 40,000 × g) to separate cytosolic from membrane fractions as previously described (9Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 602-614Google Scholar, 10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar). The total CD95 amount in the latter fractions was then detected by Western blotting as described above. Detection of Apoptosis—Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated X-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated deoxyuridine triphosphate technique was performed as described recently (9Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 602-614Google Scholar, 10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar). The number of apoptotic cells was determined by an independent examiner by counting the percentage of fluorescein-positive cells. At least 100 cells from three independent experiments from three different cell preparations were counted for each condition. Cells were visualized on an Axioskop (Zeiss). Statistics—Results from at least three independent experiments are expressed as means ± S.E. n refers to the number of independent experiments. Results were analyzed using the Student's t test: p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Hyperosmotic Activation of the EGFR Is Triggered by Src Family Kinase Yes in Rat Hepatocytes—Hyperosmotic exposure of 24-h-cultured rat hepatocytes was shown to induce within 1 min a genistein-sensitive activation of the EGFR in rat hepatocytes (10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar) and Huh7 cells (21Reinehr R. Görg B. Höngen A. Häussinger D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10364-10373Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1D). To identify the mechanisms underlying hyperosmotic EGFR activation, the role of Src kinase family members was studied. As shown in Fig. 1, mild hyperosmolarity (405 mosm) led within 1 min to an activation of Yes (Fig. 1A) and Lck (Fig. 1C), whereas Fyn became activated after 10–15 min (Fig. 1B). No significant activation of c-Src was found in response to hyperosmolarity, as assessed by immunoblots for P-Src418 and P-Src529 (not shown). In line with previous studies on inhibitor sensitivities of Src kinase family members, hyperosmotic Yes activation was largely abolished in the presence of SU6656 (22Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Google Scholar) but was insensitive to inhibition by PP-2 (23Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Google Scholar), herbimycin A (24Fukazawa H. Li P.M. Yamamoto C. Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1661-1671Google Scholar), or emodin (25Jayasuriya H. Koonchanok N.M. Geahlen R.L. McLaughlin J.L. Chang C.J. J. Nat. Prod. 1992; 55: 696-698Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). On the other hand SU6656 and PP-2, but not herbimycin A and emodin inhibited hyperosmotic Fyn activation (Fig. 1B), whereas hyperosmotic Lck activation was sensitive to PP-2 and emodin, but not to SU6656 or herbimycin A (Fig. 1C). As shown recently, hyperosmotic exposure of rat hepatocytes activates within 1 min the EGFR (10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar). Hyperosmotic EGFR activation was prevented by SU6656, whereas PP-2, herbimycin, or emodin were ineffective (Fig. 1D). The respective time courses as well as the inhibitor profiles for hyperosmotic activation of EGFR and Src kinase family members, respectively, suggest that Yes, but not Fyn or Lck, acts as an upstream kinase in the hyperosmotic EGFR activation. This view is further augmented by the finding that hyperosmotic Yes, but not Fyn or Lck56, activation was largely abolished in the presence of N-acetylcysteine (30 mm) (Fig. 1, A–C), which was recently reported also to prevent hyperosmotic EGFR activation (10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar). Because hyperosmotic exposure of hepatocytes leads to an almost instantaneous N-acetylcysteine-sensitive oxidative stress response, as shown recently by means of dichlorofluorescin diacetate fluorescence measurements (10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar), the data in Fig. 1 further suggest that hyperosmotic generation of reactive oxygen species is involved in triggering the hyperosmotic activation of Yes but not of Fyn or Lck56. Involvement of Yes in Hyperosmotic JNK Activation—As shown in Fig. 2 and in line with previous data (9Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 602-614Google Scholar, 10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar), hyperosmolarity led within 5–10 min to an activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK). Hyperosmotic JNK activation was strongly blunted in the presence of SU6656 but was insensitive to PP-2, herbimycin A, AG1478, or cyclic AMP (Fig. 2). Also Yes knockdown (see Fig. 7B below) blunted hyperosmotic JNK activation. These findings suggest that Yes is involved in triggering hyperosmotic JNK activation. In line with this, N-acetylcysteine abolished not only hyperosmotic Yes activation (Fig. 1A), but also hyperosmotic JNK activation, as shown recently (10Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Google Scholar).Fig. 7Yes knockdown inhibits the hyperosmotic activation of the CD95 system. Src-family kinase Yes protein was knocked down as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, hepatocytes were cultured in cell culture medium (untreated control) or treated with nonsense or Yes-antisense oligonucleotides for the time periods indicated. Total Yes (∼62 kDa) was detected by Western blotting. Total CD95 amount (∼48 kDa) served as a loading control and for confirmation of specificity of Yes-antisense oligonucleotides. Yes-antisense led within 4 days to a marked decrease in total Yes but not CD95 protein expression. B, in 4 days cultured hepatocytes, Yes knockdown (lane 1) largely prevents hyperosmolarity (405 mosm; stimulation for 1 min; lane 2)-induced Yes and JNK activation (stimulation for 30 min; lane 3). C, Yes, EGFR, and CD95 were immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures” after the time periods indicated below. The immunoprecipitated CD95 samples were detected for EGFR association (∼170 kDa), for CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation (CD95-P-Tyr, ∼48 kDa), for Fas-associated death domain (FADD, ∼28 kDa) and caspase 8 (Casp8, ∼54/55 kDa) association with CD95 by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitated Yes and EGFR were detected for activating phosphorylation by Src family-Y418 (P-Yes-Y418, ∼62 kDa) or tyrosine phosphorylation (P-EGFR, ∼ 170 kDa). Total Yes (∼62 kDa), total EGFR (∼170 kDa), and total CD95 (∼48 kDa) served as loading controls. The amount of CD95 (∼48 kDa) was also detected in membrane and cytosolic fractions obtained by ultracentrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative blots from at least three independent experiments are shown. Yes knockdown not only abolished hyperosmolarity-induced Yes activation (detected after 1 min of hyperosmotic exposure, lane 1), but also diminished hyperosmotic EGFR phosphorylation (1 min of hyperosmotic exposure, lane 2). Yes knockdown blunts hyperosmotic EGFR/CD95 association and CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation, which otherwise (nonsense transfection) occur within 60 min of hyperosmotic exposure (lane 3). Hyperosmolarity induces within 3 h formation of DISC, as shown by the association of CD95 with FADD and Caspase 8. Yes knockdown prevents hyperosmotic DISC formation (lane 4) and CD95 translocation from the cytosol to the membrane (lane 5). D, hepatocytes were treated with nonsense (continuous line (○, •)) or Yes-antisense oligonucleotides (dotted line (♦, ⋄) and cultured for 4 days as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were then exposed to CD95L at the concentrations indicated, and after 12 h apoptosis was detected using the"

The goal of the current study was to evaluate the influence of trace amounts of key coagulation proteases on tissue factor-independent thrombin generation using three models of coagulation. With procoagulants and select coagulation inhibitors at mean physiological concentrations, concentrations of factor IXa, factor Xa, and thrombin were set either equal to those of their AP or to values that would result based upon the rates of AP/enzyme generation and steady state enzyme inhibition. In the latter case, numerical simulation predicts that sufficient thrombin to produce a solid clot would be generated in ∼2 min. Empirical data from the synthetic plasma suggest clotting times of 3–5 min, which are similar to that observed in contact pathway-inhibited whole blood (4.3 min) initiated with the same concentrations of factors IXa and Xa and thrombin. Numerical simulations performed with the concentrations of two of the enzymes held constant and one varied suggest that the presence of any pair of enzymes is sufficient to yield rapid clot formation. Modeling of states (numerical simulation and whole blood) where only one circulating protease is present at steady state concentration shows significant thrombin generation only for factor IXa. The addition of factor Xa and thrombin has little effect (if any) on thrombin generation induced by factor IXa alone. These data indicate that 1) concentrations of active coagulation enzymes circulating in vivo are significantly lower than can be predicted from the concentrations of their AP, and 2) expected trace amounts of factor IXa can trigger thrombin generation in the absence of tissue factor. The presence of activation peptides (AP) of the vitamin K-dependent proteins in the phlebotomy blood of human subjects suggests that active serine proteases may circulate in blood as well.

These data indicate that 1) concentrations of active coagulation enzymes circulating in vivo are significantly lower than can be predicted from the concentrations of their AP, and 2) expected trace amounts of factor IXa can trigger thrombin generation in the absence of tissue factor. Five vitamin K-dependent proteins serve as precursors for serine proteases, which are essential for normal hemostasis (factors VII, IX, and X, prothrombin, and protein C) (1Jenny N.S. Mann K.G. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. 2nd Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1998: 3-27Google Scholar). The zymogens are converted to fully functional enzymes by the proteolytic removal of corresponding activation peptides. The only exception is factor VII, which is converted to an active enzyme by a single cleavage not followed by the release of an activation peptide (2Hagen F.S. Gray C.L. O'Hara P. Grant F.J. Saari G.C. Woodbury R.G. Hart C.E. Insley M. Kisiel W. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2412-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For the release of activation peptides from factor X, protein C, and prothrombin, single cleavages are required, whereas the activation peptide of factor IX is generated by two proteolytic cleavages (3Ichinose A. Davie E.W. Hemostasis and Thrombosis. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, PA1994: 19-54Google Scholar). The length of activation peptides varies from 12 amino acids for protein C to 271 amino acids for prothrombin (Fragment 1.2). There are no structural domains observed for activation peptides of factor IX, factor X, and protein C. However, fragment 1.2 of prothrombin contains a Gla domain and two kringle domains. The former one is rich in γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues and facilitates a calcium-dependent binding of prothrombin to the membranes containing acidic phospholipids (1Jenny N.S. Mann K.G. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. 2nd Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1998: 3-27Google Scholar). The kringle domain 1 contains two of three prothrombin glycosylation sites (4Mizuochi T. Fujii J. Kisiel W. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The detection of activation peptides of the vitamin K-dependent proteins in plasma of human subjects suggests that active serine proteases may circulate in blood either as a result of continuous in situ production (“idling motor”) or as a consequence of production during localized coagulation (“historical record”). The relationship between the concentrations of enzymes and their corresponding activation peptides is not clear in part because the source(s) of these peptides is not identified. A possible trigger for the generation of these peptides and corresponding enzymes can be active tissue factor hypothetically circulating in blood (5Giesen P.L. Rauch U. Bohrmann B. Kling D. Roque M. Fallon J.T. Badimon J.J. Himber J. Riederer M.A. Nemerson Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2311-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Alternatively, they can be generated due to the initiation of the coagulation cascade during phlebotomy and processing of blood. The key problem for the evaluation of active enzymes is that direct assays of these serine proteases are difficult (if possible at all) due to their rapid neutralization by the natural inhibitors present in blood.To circumvent this obstacle, assays for the activation peptides released during the generation of serine proteases involved in blood coagulation as well as for the reaction and inhibition products of these enzymes have been developed (6Lau H.K.

The validity of this question can be illustrated by the observation that estimated activation peptide levels are dependent upon the conditions of sample collection (27Tripodi A. Chantarangkul V.

When desired, 10 pm relipidated TF was added (molar ratio of PCPS/TF = 5000). Factor V (40 nm) and factor VIII (1.4 nm) were added prior to the initiation of the reaction.Zymogen-Inhibitor Solution—Prothrombin (2.8 μm), factors VII (20 nm), VIIa (0.2 nm), X (340 nm), IX (180 nm), and XI (60 nm), TFPI (5 nm), and AT-III (6.8 μm) were preheated in HBS, 2 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 3 min. Thrombin, factor IXa, and factor Xa were added at 2× desired concentrations prior to the initiation of the reaction.The reaction was started by mixing equal volumes of both solutions, resulting in physiological concentrations of the zymogens, pro-cofactors, inhibitors, and platelets (or 2 μm PCPS) and desired concentrations of enzymes. Following initiation of the reaction, at selected time points, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and quenched in 20 mm EDTA in HBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mm Spectrozyme TH and assayed immediately for thrombin activity. The hydrolysis of the substrate was monitored by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Vmax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA). Thrombin generation was calculated from a standard curve prepared by serial dilutions of α-thrombin.Whole Blood ModelThe protocol used was a modification of Rand et al. (33Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two healthy donors were recruited and advised according to a protocol approved by the University of Vermont Human Studies Committee (33Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cawthern K.M. van't Veer C. Lock J.B. DiLorenzo M.E. Branda R.F. Mann K.G. Blood. 1998; 91: 4581-4592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their consent was obtained. Individuals selected exhibited normal values for the parameters of blood coagulation, protein levels, and platelet counts. Experiments were performed in tubes placed on a rocking table enclosed in a 37 °C temperature-controlled glove box using fresh CTI-inhibited (100 μg/ml CTI) blood. Blood was drawn by venipuncture and immediately delivered into the reagent-loaded tubes.Time Course—All tubes (four series per experiment) were loaded with CTI. No additional reagents are added to the phlebotomy control series (four tubes). Six tubes were loaded with relipidated TF (TF/PCPS, 5 pm/25 nm) in HBS, 2 mm CaCl2; eight tubes were loaded with 97 pm factor IXa; and another eight tubes were loaded with 97 pm factor IXa, 5.5 pm factor Xa, and 5.3 pm thrombin. The zero-time tube of each series was pretreated with 1 ml of 50 mm EDTA and 10 μl of 10 mm FPRck (diluted in 10 mm HCl). After blood was delivered, the tubes were periodically (2–20 min) quenched with EDTA and FPRck.Final Levels of the TAT—In these experiments, all tubes were loaded in duplicates with CTI and the desired concentrations of thrombin, factor IXa, and factor Xa (individually or all three together). The TF control tubes are loaded with 5 pm relipidated TF. Tubes were quenched with EDTA and FPRck 20 min after fresh blood was added.In all experiments, no more than 35 μl of reagents were loaded in each tube. The clotting time was observed visually by two observers and was recorded when “clumps” were observed on the side of the tube. After the experiment, tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatants were aliquoted and analyzed for the TAT concentration.Plasma Preparation for the Fluorogenic AssayBlood (10 ml) from a healthy volunteer was drawn into a syringe loaded with 10 ml of HBS containing 50 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was made by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min followed by the centrifugation at 11,000 rpm (20,000 × g) for 10 min. When kept on ice, plasma did not clot for at least 10 h. One fraction of the PPP was used for the fluorogenic assay immediately and another one was spiked with 1 pm α-thrombin and kept for 1 h before the assay.Fluorogenic Thrombin Activity Assay in the PPPFluorogenic substrate VPRnbs at a final 50 μm concentration was added to a cuvette containing PPP. This substrate allows the quantitation of α-thrombin at concentrations as low as 20 fm (41Butenas S. DiLorenzo M.E. Mann K.G. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Change in fluorescence over time representing substrate hydrolysis was monitored in a spectrofluorometer FluoroMax-2 (Jobin Yvon-Spex Instruments S.A., Inc.) at 25 °C for 15 min using λex = 350 nm and λem = 470 nm. Light-scattering artifacts were minimized with a 450-nm cut-off filter in the emission light beam. Hirudin at 1 μm was added to the reaction mixture, and a change in fluorescence was monitored again. Rates of substrate hydrolysis were established from a calibration line constructed using the detecting group (6-amino-1-naphthalene-(n-butyl)sulfonamide).Estimation of the in Vivo Concentrations of Free EnzymesThe concentration of a given free enzyme in a dynamic system containing stoichiometric inhibitors is determined by the balance between the rate of enzyme generation and the rate(s) of inhibition. Assuming that the concentrations of inhibitors are relatively constant in blood under normal flow, the concentration of free enzyme can be described by the following equation: v = k1[I1]·[Ef] + k2[I2]·[Ef] +... + kn[In]·[Ef], where v is the rate of enzyme generation; k1, k2,... kn are the second order rate constants defining the rates of reactions of inhibitors I1, I2,... In with a particular enzyme (30Hockin M.F. Jones K.C. Everse S.J. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18322-18333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar); and Ef is free enzyme.The rate of generation of each enzyme was assumed to be equal to the rate of removal of its activation peptide from blood (19Bauer K.A. Bailliere's Clin. Haematol. 1999; 12: 387-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The latter was assumed to be a first order process, and the rate constant (kAP) could be calculated using the reported half-life for each activation peptide (AP) (see Table I). Ongoing rates of activation peptide removal and equal rates of enzyme formation are then defined as the product kAP[AP] using reported steady state concentrations of activation peptides (13Bucek R.A.

Open table in a new tab Operational DefinitionsThe initiation phase of thrombin generation was defined as a time interval from the start of the reaction (represented by 0 on the x axis in the figures) to the point of intersection of the x axis and a tangent to the maximum slope of thrombin generation. It is characterized by relatively slow prothrombin activation and the proteolytic processing steps required for the assembly of the vitamin K-dependent protein activating complexes. The propagation phase of thrombin generation is defined as a time interval from the end of the initiation phase to the maximum thrombin concentration. It is characterized by robust prothrombin activation principally by factor Xa·factor Va·membrane (the prothrombinase complex) with factor Xa provided predominantly by the factor IXa·factor VIIIa·membrane complex (the intrinsic factor Xase).RESULTSNumerical Simulations Predicting the Influence of Simultaneous Variations of Thrombin, Factor Xa, and Factor IXa on Thrombin Generation in the Absence of TFFig. 1 represents thrombin generation over time initiated with the mixture of all three enzymes. Reported concentrations of activation peptides of serine protease zymogens involved in blood coagulation circulating in vivo for healthy individuals varied from 94 pm for factor X to 210 pm for factor IX and to 1.0 nm for prothrombin (F1.2). In the presence of serine proteases at these concentrations, thrombin generation entered the propagation phase after a very short initiation phase (i.e. blood containing these concentrations of enzymes would clot in a few seconds (Fig. 1, solid line). The maximum concentration of active thrombin produced reached almost 1.0 μm, with the maximum rate of generation as high as 28 nm/s. A decrease in the concentration of all three enzymes by 1 order of magnitude (9.4 pm for factor Xa, 21 pm for factor IXa, and 100 pm for thrombin) prolonged the initiation phase to 100 s and decreased both maximum concentration and maximum rate of thrombin generation to 630 nm and 8.5 nm/s, respectively (long dashed line). A further decrease of the enzyme concentrations to 1% of those reported for activation peptides (0.94 pm factor Xa, 2.1 pm factor IXa, and 10 pm thrombin) prolonged the initiation phase to 600 s, decreased maximum concentration of active thrombin to 260 nm, and provided a maximum rate of thrombin generation of 1.1 nm/s (*). No active thrombin was observed in 20 min of the reaction when concentrations of all three enzymes were decreased to 0.1% (94 fm for factor Xa, 0.21 pm for factor IXa, and 1 pm for thrombin) of those detected for their activation peptides (short dashed line).The enzyme concentrations selected for the initial studies of thrombin generation were either equal to those of activation peptides or decreased in sequential studies by orders of magnitude.

Loss of function of the tuberous sclerosis 2 gene (TSC2), a tumor suppressor gene, has been associated with a growth-promoting effect of E2. We hypothesized that tuberin, the protein product of TSC2, binds to estrogen receptors (ER) and regulates the growth effect of E2. An in vivo association between full-length tuberin and ERα was observed in HEK 293 cells and ELT-3 smooth muscle cells. In contrast, poor association was observed between tuberin and ERβ. Complex formation with ERα and the C-terminal end of tuberin was also observed in vivo and in vitro, indicating that binding between ERα and tuberin occurs at the C-terminal end of the tuberin molecule. We examined the effect of tuberin expression in ELT-3 smooth muscle cells on the growth response to E2. The growth-promoting effect of E2 in tuberin-null ELT-3 smooth muscle cells was ERα-specific, associated with up-regulation and activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ) and activation of the signaling intermediate, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/-2 (ERK-1/2). In contrast, the expression of tuberin in ELT-3 smooth muscle cells resulted in significant abrogation of E2-stimulated growth. In parallel with this observation, the expression of tuberin in ELT-3 cells also resulted in significant inhibition of PDGFRβ and ERK-1/2 activation in response to E2. These results demonstrate that tuberin binds specifically to ERα and inhibits E2-induced proliferation of ELT-3 cells. Furthermore, the opposing effects of tuberin on estrogen-induced activation of PDGFRβ and ERK-1/-2 suggest a pivotal role for tuberin in directing the signaling events that dictate the growth response to E2.

Estrogen is a naturally occurring steroid hormone that has widespread and diverse biologic actions (1Gruber C.J. Tschugguel W. Schneeberger C. Huber J.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 340-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Estrogen is important for the normal growth and differentiation of many reproductive tissues and can also stimulate the growth of benign and malignant tumors of the breast and endometrium (2Lippman M. Bolan G. Huff K. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 4595-4601PubMed Google Scholar, 3Farnell Y.Z. Ing N.H. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 84: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the study of cellular growth in response to estrogen has revealed both stimulatory and inhibitory properties of estrogen on vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells (4Mendelsohn M.E.

Although much is known about the tissue-specific growth effects of estrogen, less is known about the mechanisms that underlie this diverse response. The biological effects of estrogen were traditionally thought to be determined by estrogen receptors ERα 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; E2, 17β estradiol; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; GFP, green fluorescence protein; mTor, mammalian target of rapamycin; ELT, Eker rat leiomyoma tumor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; GST, glutathione S-transferase; THC, R,R-tetrahydrochrysene. and ERβ, where the main effect occurs through transit of the ligand-bound receptor to the nucleus and consequent transcriptional activation of ER (1Gruber C.J.

Science. 2002; 296: 1642-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The diverse and variable effects of estrogens can be explained by different ligand affinities and tissue distributions of ERα and ERβ, the large number of cytoplasmic chaperone proteins that regulate estrogen/ER complex location, and a large family of nuclear proteins (co-repressors and co-activators) that modulate transcription driven by estrogen response elements in the nuclear genome (10Kuiper G.G.

Tuberin is a tumor suppressor protein that is encoded by the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) gene located on chromosome 16 (19The European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis ConsortiumCell. 1993; 75: 1305-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Patients with inactivation of one copy of the TSC2 gene develop tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is characterized by benign tumor growths of the skin, heart, brain, kidney, and lungs. Aberrant expression of TSC2 (tuberin) occurs in the lungs and kidneys of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a disease that primarily affects females (19The European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis ConsortiumCell. 1993; 75: 1305-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar, 20Ohori N.P.

Furthermore, loss of function of TSC2 is associated with aberrant ER expression in proliferating smooth muscle cells found in the kidney and lung, suggesting that tuberin is involved in regulating the response of smooth muscle cells to estrogen (20Ohori N.P.

Although tuberin has not been shown to have direct transcriptional capacity, it has been shown that overexpression of tuberin in HEK 293 cells inhibits steroid- and ER-mediated transcription (24Henry K.W.

Biophys. 2002; 398: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that tuberin localizes to cytoplasmic and nuclear cellular compartments to bind to and modify the function of cellular proteins such as hamartin, calmodulin, and cyclins (26Noonan D.J.

Several lines of evidence now also confirm that tuberin is a phosphorylated protein, that phosphorylation is regulated by Akt, and that tuberin expression is associated with reduced phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, which lies downstream of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) (reviewed in Ref. 29Kwiatkowski D.J. Ann. Hum. Genet. 2003; 67: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have also highlighted a novel relationship between tuberin and members of the MAP kinase family, ERK and p38 (30Govindarajan B. Mizesko M.C. Miller M.S. Onda H. Nunnelly M. Casper K. Brat D. Cohen C. Arbiser J.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 3469-3475PubMed Google Scholar, 31Li Y. Inoki K. Vacratsis P. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

Thus, it is now clear that tuberin is a protein that functions as a signaling molecule that can modulate many potential intracellular pathways involved in the regulation of cell growth. Previously, we analyzed the growth effects of estrogen in uterine-derived tuberin-null ELT-3 smooth muscle cells and tuberin-expressing vascular smooth muscle cells (33Finlay G.A. Hunter D.S. Walker C.L. Paulson K.E. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C409-C418Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells that constitutively express tuberin, the growth inhibitory effect of estrogen was associated with down-regulation of PDGFBB and PDGF receptor (PDGFRβ) and limited activation of ERK MAP kinase. In contrast, the positive growth effect of estrogen in tuberin-null ELT-3 cells was dependent upon the up-regulation of PDGFBB and PDGFRβ and prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase. Although the opposing effects of estrogen may have been cell type-specific, we hypothesized that the opposing effects of estrogen were due to the altered expression of tuberin. Herein, we demonstrate that the growth-stimulating effect of estrogen in tuberin-null ELT-3 smooth muscle cells is ERα-specific and is associated with the activation of PDGFRβ and ERK-1/2 MAP kinase. We show that tuberin binds specifically to ERα and inhibits estrogen-induced growth of ELT-3 cells, an effect that is associated with attenuated activation of PDGFRβ and ERK-1/2 MAP kinase. These results suggest that tuberin functions as a key protein in the regulation of estrogen-induced cellular growth and that tuberin acts as a molecular switch to dictate the growth response to estrogen in ELT-3 smooth muscle cells. ELT-3 cells (Eker rat uterine leiomyoma-derived smooth muscle cells) were obtained from and characterized by Dr. Cheryl Walker (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) (34Howe S.R. Gottardis M.M. Everitt J.I. Goldsworthy T.L. Wolf D.C. Walker C. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1568-1579PubMed Google Scholar, 35Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). ELT-3 cells were grown and maintained in DF8 medium as previously described (34Howe S.R. Gottardis M.M. Everitt J.I. Goldsworthy T.L. Wolf D.C. Walker C. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1568-1579PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments were performed on ELT-3 cells between passages 29 and 32. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In all experiments using 17β estradiol (E2) (Sigma), serum was withdrawn for at least 24 h prior to the administration of E2 in serum-free medium. Standard recombinant DNA technologies were utilized to develop mammalian expression constructs of TSC2 as previously described (20Ohori N.P. Yousem S.A. Sonmez-Alpan E. Colby T.V. Am. J. Clin.

Biophys. 2002; 398: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus expressing various TSC2 cDNA constructs were created using the AdEasy vector system (36He T.C.

Full-length TSC2 (SalI and XbaI), the C-terminal 672 amino acids of TSC2 (SalI and XbaI), a full-length TSC2 with a sequence for green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused to its C terminus (NheI and XbaI), the C-terminal 672 amino acids of TSC2 with a GFP sequence fused to its C terminus (NheI and XbaI), and human ERα (EcoRI) were restriction-digested from their previously described mammalian expression constructs (24Henry K.W.

These constructs were subsequently used to transform electroporation-competent AdEasier-1 BJ5183 cells (37Zeng M. Smith S.K. Siegel F. Shi Z. Van Kampen K.R. Elmets C.A. Tang D.C. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) containing a copy of the pAdEasy vector. pAdEasy-pShuttle-TSC2 recombinants were identified by restriction analysis and authenticated by DNA sequencing through their recombination sites using vector-specific primers. pAdEasy-TSC2 recombinants were used in CaPO4 transfection (38Wigler M.

A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) of 90% confluent HEK 293 cells and monitored for plaque formation. The overexpression of tuberin for these various constructs was established by Western blotting and probing with anti-tuberin antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and/or anti-GFP antisera (Clontech). Viral cultures from appropriate expression constructs were amplified in HEK 293 cells and stored at -70 °C. Viral infections were generally carried out in experimental protocols by simply adding 100 μl of the amplified culture to a 90% confluent plate of test cells (HEK 293). The cells were incubated with virus for 18-24 h and processed as described below. Generation of retroviral vectors and revertant cells is described in brief. PT67, pLXIN, pIREShyg3, and hygromycin B were purchased from Clontech. A DNA fragment containing IRES and hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene was PCR-amplified from pIREShyg3 and replaced the DNA sequence of IRES and the hygromycin resistant gene in pLXIN from BamHI and SphI sites. Human TSC2 cDNA was then subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of the pIREShyg retroviral vector. The plasmids were transfected with LipofectAMINE 200 (Invitrogen) into retroviral packing PT67 cells. Filtered medium containing retrovirus was stored until use. Retrovirally mediated transfer of either TSC2 or empty vector was achieved by treating ELT-3 cells with equal amounts of retrovirus in the presence of DF-8 medium containing 10% serum. After 24 h, the virus was withdrawn, and the cells were grown for an additional 24 h in medium containing 10% serum. For the preparation of stable cell lines expressing TSC2, hygromycin (100 μg/ml) was used to select TSC2 expressing colonies of ELT-3 cells. Four individual colonies of TSC2 expressing ELT-3 cells were grown, passaged, and expanded. Protein lysates were prepared, and the expression of tuberin was assessed by Western immunoblot as described below. Coulter Counting—The cells were seeded at a density of 0.5 × 104 cells/ml on 35-mm Petri dishes. When cultures achieved 10-20% confluency, the serum was withdrawn from the culture medium for 24-48 h. The cell cultures were treated with 10 nm E2 (Sigma) in the absence of serum and were counted using a Coulter counter (Technical Communications, Coulter Electronics) at the intervals indicated in the text. All of the cell growth experiments were performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least twice to ensure reproducibility. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—The protocol used has been described in detail (39Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Finlay G.A. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L282-L291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were seeded at a density of 0.5 × 102 cells/ml on 96-well plates. When cultures achieved 30-40% confluency, serum was withdrawn from the culture medium for 24 h. The cells were treated with 10 nm E2 (Sigma) in the absence of serum. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/well; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the culture medium at the specified times indicated in the text. The cells were washed, and radioactivity was counted. The experiments were performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least twice to ensure reproducibility. Inhibitors used in these studies include the specific ER inhibitor ICI 182,780 (1 μm; Tocris, Ellisville, MO) and the selective ERβ inhibitor THC (R,R-tetrahydrochrysene, 10-6 m; kindly provided by Dr. Benita S. Katzenellenbogen, University of Illinois (40Meyers M.J. Sun J. Carlson K.E. Marriner G.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4230-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar)). THC is a nonsteroidal ligand structurally unrelated to the typical ER antagonists, tamoxifen, and ICI 182,780. The R,R-enantiomer of THC is a pure ERβ antagonist with a relative binding affinity of 25% compared with E2. Other inhibitors used include actinomycin D (0.05 μg/ml; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and rapamycin (10 nm; Cell Signaling Technology), which specifically inhibits the activation of mTOR and downstream phosphorylation of S6. The length of treatment and the doses are indicated in the text. The preparation of whole cell and membrane extracts has been previously described (33Finlay G.A. Hunter D.S. Walker C.L. Paulson K.E. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C409-C418Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as previously described (33Finlay G.A. Hunter D.S. Walker C.L. Paulson K.E. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C409-C418Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 μg of PDGFRβ polyclonal antibody (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), tuberin (C terminus) polyclonal antibody, or ERα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 0.5-1 mg of protein extracts. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Repligen, Cambridge, MA) were then added and rocked at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The precipitated immune complexes were washed, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were boiled and resolved by SDS-PAGE. In all of the experiments, the membranes were subsequently stripped and reblotted with an appropriate antibody to ensure immunoprecipitation of the protein of interest. To maximize the detection of ERα in samples immunoprecipitated with anti-tuberin and to minimize contaminating signal from precipitated immunoglobulin, antisera of a different species was used. GST and GST-TSC2-C672 fusion proteins were prepared from BL21-RP Escherichia coli cells essentially as previously described (26Noonan D.J. Lou D. Griffith N. Vanaman T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Pull-down assays were performed similar to previous studies (24Henry K.W. Yuan X. Koszewski N.J. Onda H. Kwiatkowski D.J. Noonan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20535-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were washed and pre-equilibrated in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40) to generate a 50% slurry. Approximately 30 μl of the 50% slurry was used per sample to bind 20 μg of purified GST-TSC2-C672. The protein-bead mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with rotation to allow binding. Unbound material was eliminated with repeated washes with Buffer A. The GST-TSC2-C672-Sepharose beads were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1.25 μg of either recombinantly purified human ERα or human ERβ in the presence or absence of 17β estradiol in a total volume of 500 μl of Buffer 1. Unbound ERα or ERβ was removed by extensive washing with Buffer A. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS-electrophoresis buffer. The proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, Western blotted to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with the indicated antisera. The blots were developed with ECL reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and detected by autoradiography on x-ray film (Kodak). The cells were seeded at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml on 100-mm Petri dishes. When cultures achieved 90-100% confluency, the serum was withdrawn, and the cells were treated with 17β estradiol (using serum-free conditions). After specific intervals noted in the text, the cells were harvested, and the extracts were prepared as previously described (33Finlay G.A. Hunter D.S. Walker C.L. Paulson K.E. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C409-C418Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were performed at least in triplicate using appropriate vehicle controls. The cell extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels. Gel proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (wet transfer). The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk or 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies to ERK-1, phosphotyrosine, ERα, tuberin (C-20), actin, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), PDGFRβ (R & D Systems), phospho-S6, S6, phospho-ERK-1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology); washed; and incubated for 1 h with appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The chemiluminescent signal was detected using ECL reagents (Cell Signaling Technology) and developed using autoradiography. Densitometric semiquantitative analysis was performed by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The data were expressed as fold activation relative to control. The results are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical analysis using a nonparametric test (Mann Whitney U) was performed using SPSS software. The significance was assumed at a p value of <0.05. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms involved in the cellular response to estrogen, we investigated a potential interaction between tuberin and ER. To demonstrate in vivo complex formation between ERα and tuberin, mammalian constructs for GFP-TSC2, GFP-TSC2-C672 (C-terminal 672 amino acids of TSC2), or ERα were expressed in HEK293 cells by adenovirally mediated transfer. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with GFP antisera and subjected to immunoblot analysis for ERα. Fig. 1A demonstrates significant complex formation between tuberin and ERα. Furthermore, complex formation is also observed in cells expressing ERα and TSC2-C672, suggesting that binding of ERα occurs within the C-terminal 672-amino acid portion of the tuberin molecule. In a series of experiments, mammalian constructs for full-length TSC2 or ERα were expressed in HEK 293 cells. The cells were treated with E2 (10 nm) (18h-24h). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ERα and analyzed by immunoblotting for tuberin. Complex formation between TSC2 and ERα was again observed independent of E2 treatment (Fig. 1B). In vitro complex formation between ERα and tuberin was next investigated. Glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-TSC2-C672 was incubated with baculovirus-expressed human recombinant ERα or ERβ in the presence and absence of E2 (10 nm). Glutathione-Sepharose-bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis for ERα or ERβ. Complex formation between TSC2-C672 and ERα was observed. E2 appeared to reduce complex formation somewhat, but complex formation was observed in the absence of ligand, suggesting that ligand was not required for this interaction (Fig. 1C). In contrast, no significant complex formation between TSC2-C672 and ERβ was demonstrated. These results indicate that tuberin and ERα are capable of forming a complex in vitro and in vivo at high expression levels and that the interaction occurs between the C-terminal residues of tuberin and ERα. Furthermore, binding of tuberin to the estrogen receptor is ERα-specific and is not E2-dependent. ELT-3 cells are tuberin-null smooth muscle cells that constitutively express ERα. We used this cell line to examine the potential in vivo interaction between tuberin and ER in greater detail. Tuberin Binds to ERα in ELT-3 Cells—Full-length TSC2 was expressed in ELT-3 cells using retrovirally mediated transfer of the TSC2 gene (TSC2 ELT-3 cells). Tuberin expression in stable cells lines was assessed in TSC2 ELT-3 cells by subjecting cell lysates to Western immunoblot with anti-tuberin antibody and compared with ELT-3 cells (ELT-3) and to ELT-3 cells expressing empty vector only (EV ELT-3 cells) (Fig. 2A). Successful expression of tuberin was observed in TSC2 ELT-3 cells, and the absence of tuberin expression was noted in ELT-3 cells and in EV ELT-3 cells. Tuberin expression in TSC2 ELT-3 cells was 3-fold (mean ± S.D.; 3.02 ± 0.46) higher than that seen in primary pulmonary fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, or vascular endothelial cells (results not shown). In vivo complex formation between tuberin and ERα was next examined in TSC2 ELT-3 cells by subjecting immunoprecipitates of ERα to immunoblot analysis for tuberin (Fig. 2B, upper panel) and immunoprecipitates of tuberin to immunoblot analysis for ERα (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Co-immunoprecipitation of ERα and tuberin was observed in TSC2 ELT-3 cells compared with ELT-3 cells and EV ELT-3 cells. Overall, these results are similar to that observed in the overexpression studies showing that ERα, under conditions of constitutive expression, binds in vivo to full-length tuberi"

Within the tsetse fly, procyclic trypanosomes differentiate to elongated mesocyclic cells. However, although mesocyclic trypanosomes isolated from tsetse flies also show active microtubule extension at the posterior end, the kinetoplast is coincidentally repositioned such that it always lies approximately midway between the nucleus and posterior end of the cell.

Horseradish peroxidase-, myeloperoxidase-, and cyclooxygenasecatalyzed oxidation of phenol in the presence of H2O2 and GSH caused the generation of phenoxyl radicals and GS· radicals, of which only the latter reacted with Ac-Tempo.

H2O2/phenolinduced peroxidation of major classes of phospholipids in HL-60 cells was completely inhibited by Ac-Tempo, indicating that GS· radicals were responsible for phospholipid peroxidation.

Thiols are said to fulfill important antioxidant functions in cells and biological fluids. In particular, glutathione, the most abundant intracellular low molecular weight thiol, regulates the content of H2O2 and organic (lipid) hydroperoxides via glutathione peroxidase-catalyzed reactions. GSH is also commonly presumed to act as a universal free radical sink toward a wide variety of different types of free radicals (1Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol.

Although scavenging of reactive radicals by GSH is believed to be an important antioxidant function of the latter, it may render effective protection only if the sulfur-centered glutathionyl radicals (GS·) 1The abbreviations used are: GS·, glutathionyl radical; Ac-Tempo, 4-((9-acridinecarbonyl)amino)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl; Ac-piperidine, 4-((9-acridinecarbonyl)amino)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; GS-NO, S-nitrosoglutathione; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; hSA, human serum albumin; MPO, myeloperoxidase; MS, mass spectrometry; mT, millitesla; NEM, N-ethyl maleimide; PAPA NONOate, (Z)-1-[N-(3-ammoniopropyl)-N-(n-propyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate; PBN, α-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ph, phenol; PMC, 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-hydroxychromane; PnA, cis-parinaric acid; VP-16, etoposide or 4′-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-9-(4,6-O-ethylidene-β-d-glucopyranoside). formed in the scavenging reactions do not further propagate free radical generation. On the contrary, pro-oxidant activity of GSH should be expected if GS· radicals are reactive enough to interact with and cause damage to vital intracellular molecules. In fact, experiments in model systems indicate that GS· radicals can abstract hydrogen atoms from carbohydrates such as 2-deoxy-d-ribose and initiate irreversible DNA damage (6Pogocki D. Schoneich C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thiyl radicals are also capable of hydrogen abstraction from α-amino C-H bonds of amino acids with the consequent formation of carbon-centered radicals (7Zhao R. Lind J. Merbnyi G. Eriksen T.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 12010-12015Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, reactions of thiyl radicals with carbohydrates and amino acids are reversible; moreover, carbon-centered radicals of carbohydrates and amino acids are stronger oxidants than thiyl radicals, suggesting that thiols may “repair” carbohydrate- and amino acidderived radicals. It is likely that thiyl radicals can effectively oxidize polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) via abstraction of bis-allylic hydrogens, yielding pentadienyl radicals (8Schoneich C. Dillinger U. Von Bruchhausen F. Asmus K.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with the subsequent formation of conjugated dienes, thiol-fatty acid adducts, and hydroperoxides (9Sprinz H. Schwinn J. Naumov S. Brede O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Ferreri C. Costantino C. Perrotta L. Landi L. Mulazzani Q.G. Chatgilialoglu C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 4459-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, thiyl radicals can catalytically accelerate cis-trans isomerization of polyunsaturated fatty acid residues in phospholipids (9Sprinz H. Schwinn J. Naumov S. Brede O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Ferreri C. Costantino C. Perrotta L. Landi L. Mulazzani Q.G. Chatgilialoglu C. J. Am. Chem.

These pro-oxidant reactions of thiyl radicals have been detected only in relatively simple chemical systems during the massive production of thiyl radicals induced by pulse radiolysis or chemolysis with azoinitiators. Pro-oxidant activity of GS· radicals has not been studied in detail under physiologically relevant conditions. The most commonly used approach to detecting GS· radicals is based on their spin trapping (11Schreiber J. Foureman G.L. Hughes M.F. Mason R.P. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7936-7943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kwak H.S. Yim H.S. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The low sensitivity of this technique and the instability of spin adducts are not sufficient to directly observe glutathionyl radicals in live cells (15Stoyanovosky D.A. Goldman R. Jonnalagadda S.S. Day B.W. Claycamp H.G. Kagan V.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To overcome these technical difficulties, we chose to use a sensitive method for the monitoring of radicals by using fluorophore-containing spin traps as probes to localize free radicals in cells (16Pou S. Huang Y.I. Bhan A. Bhadti V.S. Hosmane R.S. Wu S.Y. Cao G.L. Rosen G.M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Blough N.V. Simpson D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 1915-1917Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We applied this approach to real time quantitative monitoring of intracellular glutathionyl radicals by fluorescence microscopy based on the electron exchange effects in a reporter molecule, 4-((9-acridinecarbonyl)amino)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Ac-Tempo), that specifically interacts with GS· radicals. Ac-Tempo contains two chemical moieties conjugated by a peptide bond, namely fluorescent acridine and a stable paramagnetic nitroxide radical called Tempo, and, similar to Sphinx, it inherits duality of their physical properties. The nitroxide radical, however, quenches the fluorescence of acridine through an intramolecular intersystem crossing induced by electron exchange (18Herbelin S.E. Blough N.V. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 8170-8176Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We established that the reaction of GS· radicals with the nitroxide moiety of Ac-Tempo converts it to the corresponding piperidine, which therefore eliminates the quenching to yield a readily measurable fluorescence from acridine moiety and the disappearance of a typical EPR signal from the nitroxide radical. Thus, quantitative fluorescence microscopy (and fluorescence spectroscopy) of GS· radical formation can be supported by EPR spectroscopy as well as by HPLC measurements. Peroxidase-catalyzed, one-electron oxidation of phenolic compounds to the respective phenoxyl radicals has been reported to initiate “futile thiol pumping” due to the interaction of phenoxyl radicals with GSH, yielding GS· radicals (11Schreiber J.

Commun. 1984; 125: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether these reactions occur in live cells and to further study the interaction of GS· radicals with intracellular constituents, we used Ac-Tempo as a reporter molecule specifically reacting with GS· radicals upon the stimulation of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in HL-60 cells. We were able to visualize the formation of MPO-induced glutathionyl radicals during the H2O2-supported metabolism of phenol (Ph), and we established that GS· radicals initiated the oxidation of phospholipids in live cells and caused cell death. Reagents—Phenol, tyrosine, etoposide, hemin, sodium azide, magnesium chloride, glucose, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, HEPES, N-ethylmaleimide, acetonitrile (HPLC grade), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, succinyl acetone, guaiacol, glutathione, S-nitrosoglutathione, fatty acid-free human serum albumin (hSA), fetal bovine serum, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), α-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone (PBN), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (type VI; EC 1.11.1.7), and myeloperoxidase (from human leukocytes, EC 1.11.1.7) were purchased from Sigma. Ac-Tempo and cis-parinaric acid (PnA) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Chloroform, 2-propanol, and hexane (HPLC grade) were purchased from Aldrich. Human recombinant cyclooxygenase-2 (isolated from a baculovirus overexpression system in Sf21 cells) was purchased from the Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Cell Cultures and Treatments—Human myelogenous leukemia HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 12% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. MPO activity in cells was assayed with guaiacol as described previously (13Kagan V.E. Yalowich J.C. Borisenko G.G. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Thampatty P. Fabisiak J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To decrease MPO activity, cells were treated with an inhibitor of heme synthesis, succinyl acetone (0.4 mm, for 48 h). Trypan blue dye exclusion assay was used to assess cell viability. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were pre-incubated with Ac-Tempo (100 μm) in PBS for 5 min, and then Ph (100 μm) and H2O2 (20 μm) were added and incubated for 5 min. After treatments, cells were washed and resuspended in PBS for microscopy assay. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Nikon ECLIPSE TE 200 fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital Hamamatsu CCD camera (C4742-95-12NRB). Data were analyzed using MetaImaging Series™ software version 4.6 (Universal Imaging Corp.). At least 200 cells per experimental condition were counted. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—A Shimadzu spectrofluorimeter RF-5301PC was employed for fluorescence measurements in a 0.2-ml quartz cuvette. Ac-Tempo fluorescence spectra were detected using an excitation wavelength of 361 nm (excitation slit of 1.5 nm and an emission slit of 3 nm). The time course of fluorescence intensity was monitored using an emission wavelength of 440 nm. Concentration of Ac-Tempo was determined by measurements of optical density at 359 nm (ϵ = 10.4 mm- cm-) using a Shimadzu UV160U spectrophotometer. To determine concentrations of Ac-Tempo and 4-((9-acridinecarbonyl)amino)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (Ac-piperidine) in cells, we used fluorescence spectroscopy of the latter corrected for the contributing fluorescence of Ac-Tempo. This value was estimated based on experimentally determined intracellular concentrations using the characteristic EPR signals of Ac-Tempo (see below). EPR Spectroscopy—EPR measurements were performed on a JEOL-RE1X spectrometer (Kyoto, Japan) at 25 °C in glass capillary tubes (1.2-mm internal diameter; Fischer Scientific Co.). The tube (∼12 cm in length) was filled with 50 μl of mixed sample and placed in an opened 3-mm inner diameter EPR quartz tube. EPR spectra of Ac-Tempo, as well as spin traps, were recorded under the following conditions: center field, 335.7 mT; sweep width, 8 mT; sweep width; field modulation, 0.2 mT; microwave power, 10 milliwatts; time constant, 0.1 s; and time scan, 1 min. HPLC Analysis of Ac-Tempo Derivatives—HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu liquid chromatograph LC-600 equipped with absorbance diode array detector SPD-M10A (Tokyo, Japan). The sample was applied to a reverse phase Alltech Econosphere C18 5U column (5-μm; 4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with a solvent A (75 mm ammonium acetate, 50 mm citric acid, and 5% acetonitrile, pH 3.5). The column was eluted during the first 5 min with solvent A and then from min 5 to min 20 with a linear gradient from 0 to 35% of solvent B (100% acetonitrile). Flow rate was 1 ml/min. Injection volume was 20 μl. The elution profile was monitored by optical density in the range 200-400 nm. To prepare cell extracts for the HPLC assay, HL-60 cells (106 cells) were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in PBS buffer, homogenized by ultrasonication, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant obtained was treated with acetonitrile (1:1) for 5 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Thus obtained supernatant was evaporated under nitrogen gas and resuspended in 30 μl of PBS for the injection. Measurements of Phospholipid Peroxidation Using Metabolic Labeling with PnA—PnA was incorporated into phospholipids of HL-60 cells by the addition of its human hSA complex as described previously (21Ritov V.B. Banni S. Yalowich J.C. Day B.W. Claycamp H.G. Corongiu F.P. Kagan V.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1283: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in log phase of growth were rinsed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red and resuspended in this medium to give a cell density of 106 cells/ml. PnA-hSA complex was added to the cell suspension to give a final concentration of 2 mg of PnA per milliliter, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in the dark under aerobic conditions. At the end of incubation period, the cells were consequently washed twice with PBS containing fatty acid-free hSA (0.5 mg/ml) and not containing hSA, respectively, and resuspended in PBS containing 50 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Then cells were incubated with H2O2 and Ac-Tempo (100 μm) for 2 h at 37 °C. H2O2 (25 μm) was added every 30 min. At the end of incubation, lipids were extracted from cells using a slightly modified Folch procedure. Extracted lipids were dissolved in 0.2 ml of 2-propanol/hexane/water (4:3:0.6; v/v/v). Lipid phosphorus was determined using a previously described method (22Chalvardjian A. Rudnicki E. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 36: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Lipid extracts were separated by HPLC using an ammonium acetate gradient essentially as described previously (23Van Kessel W.S. Hax W.M. Demel R.A. De Gier J. Biochim. Biophys. Act. 1977; 486: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The lipid extract was applied to a 5-mm Supelcosil LC-Si column (4.6 × 3 × 250 mm) equilibrated with a mixture of 1 part of solvent A (2-propanol/hexane/water) (57:43:1, v/v/v) and 9 parts of solvent B (2-propanol/hexane/40 mm aqueous ammonium acetate, pH 6.8) (57:43:10; v/v/v). The column was eluted during the first 3 min with a linear gradient increasing from 10 to 37% solvent B; the period from min 3 to min 15 was isocratic at 37% solvent B; from min 15 to min 23 the linear gradient rose to 100% B; and then the period from min 23 to min 45 was isocratic at 100% solvent B. The solvent flow rate was 1 ml/min. A Shimadzu high-performance liquid chromatograph (LC-600) equipped with fluorescence detector (RF-551) was used. The effluent was monitored by fluorescence of PnA by emission at 420 nm after excitation at 324 nm. Mass Spectral Analysis—Ac-Tempo and derivatives were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry by direct infusion into a Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Inc., Manchester, England). The electrospray probe was operated at a voltage differential of 3.5 keV (positive ion mode). Mass spectra were obtained by scanning the range of 150-950 m/z every 2.6 s and summing individual spectra. Source temperature was maintained at 70 °C. Collision-induced dissociation spectra were obtained by selecting the ion of interest and performing daughter ion scanning in Q3 using argon gas in the collision chamber. The spectrometer was operated at unit resolution in Q1 and slightly below unit resolution in Q3. To prepare cell extracts for MS assay, HL-60 cells (3 × 106 cells) were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in water, and extracted using a Folch procedure. Methanol and then chloroform were added to a cell suspension (1:2:1) and mixed; the mixture was incubated for 15 min under N2. After centrifugation for 5 min at 1,500 × g, the lower chloroform layer was collected, and the extraction was repeated with the upper aqueous methanol layer. Finally, the combined chloroform layers were evaporated under a stream of N2 and resuspended in 30 μl of acetonitrile. Statistics—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Changes in variables for different assays were analyzed either by Student's t test (single comparisons) or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparisons. Differences among means were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Biochemical Evidence for Selective Interactions of Ac-Tempo with GS· Radicals during Peroxidase-catalyzed Oxidation of Phenol in the Presence of H2O2 and GSH—The conjugate of Tempo and acridine, Ac-Tempo, is a paramagnetic compound that has a characteristic triplet EPR signal originating from its nitroxide moiety with the hyperfine constant aNTempo = 16.9 G (Fig. 1A). Ac-Tempo does not exert fluorescence from the acridine moiety (Fig. 1B) due to the quenching produced by electron exchange interactions between the Tempo radical and the excited state of acridine (18Herbelin S.E. Blough N.V. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 8170-8176Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The fluorescence quenching of Ac-Tempo can be eliminated upon conversion of the nitroxide moiety into a non-paramagnetic species, e.g. in the course of its interaction with another radical. GS· Radicals Interact with Ac-Tempo—Because of our interest in the reactions of glutathionyl radicals, we determined whether the radicals could convert Ac-Tempo into a non-paramagnetic fluorescent product. To this end, we generated glutathionyl radicals using UV-induced homolytic decomposition of S-nitrosylated glutathione (GS-NO). Irradiation of GS-NO in the presence of Ac-Tempo eliminated the EPR signal from the nitroxide moiety and induced characteristic fluorescence of the acridine moiety (Fig. 1, A and B). The effect was dependent on the amount of GS-NO added (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the addition of an excess of spin trap, DMPO, which forms a stable adduct with glutathionyl radicals (DMPO-GS·), yielded an EPR signal characteristic of the DMPO-GS· adduct with the splitting constants aN = 15.4 G and aHβ = 16.2 G (Fig. 1A, marked with +). Notably, DMPO inhibited the conversion of Ac-Tempo into a non-paramagnetic fluorescent product (Fig. 1, A and C). In control experiments, UV-irradiation of Ac-Tempo alone or the incubation of Ac-Tempo with an NO donor, PAPANONO-ate, did not trigger fluorescence response (Fig. 1C); neither did these treatments affect the Ac-Tempo EPR spectra (not shown). These results demonstrate that GS· radicals were able to directly react with Ac-Tempo. GSH Is Essential for the Conversion of Ac-Tempo into a Non-paramagnetic Fluorescent Product during HRP-catalyzed Oxidation of Phenol—We further determined to what extent GS· radicals generated by a biologically more relevant oxidation system, i.e. peroxidase-catalyzed, one-electron oxidation of phenol to its phenoxyl radical in the presence of H2O2 and GSH, can convert Ac-Tempo into a non-paramagnetic fluorescent product (Scheme 1). The incubation of Ac-Tempo with HRP, H2O2, phenol, and glutathione induced decay of the EPR signal from Ac-Tempo and the emission of its fluorescence (Fig. 2, A and B). Peroxidase activity was essential, because the effect was not observed in the absence of peroxidase or H2O2. Fluorescence emission was not induced by HRP and H2O2 without phenol and GSH, suggesting that Ac-Tempo is not a “good” substrate for peroxidase; it was also not induced by HRP, H2O2, and phenol, indicating that the interactions of Ac-Tempo with phenoxyl radicals did not cause fluorescence response. GSH alone did not cause a reduction of Ac-Tempo that was observable by fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy even at concentrations as high as 5 mm (data not shown). Thus, the presence of GSH in the incubation system containing HRP, H2O2, and phenol was critical to the Ac-Tempo modification. Moreover, EPR signal decay and the magnitude of fluorescence emitted depended strongly on the amount of GSH added (Fig. 2, C and D).Fig. 2The effect of the HRP-catalyzed oxidation of phenol in the presence of H2O2 and GSH on the EPR spectra and the fluorescence emission of Ac-Tempo is dependent on GSH concentration. A, EPR signals. B, fluorescence spectra. The reaction mixture contained 10 μm Ac-Tempo pre-incubated without (a) or with 0.1 units/ml HRP, 50 μm phenol, 10 μm GSH, and 10 μm H2O2 for 10 min (b). C and D, time course of Ac-Tempo EPR signal decay and fluorescence emission produced by HRP/phenol/H2O2 in the presence of a range of GSH concentrations (a, 0 μm; b, 1.25 μm; c, 2.5 μm; d, 5.0 μm; and e, 10.0 μm). Other conditions were 0.1 units/ml HRP, 10 μm Ac-Tempo, 50 μm phenol, and 10 μm H2O2. Fluorescence was detected using an excitation wavelength of 361 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm.

If peroxidase-generated GS· radicals are reactive toward Ac-Tempo, then their scavenging should inhibit conversion of Ac-Tempo into a fluorescent product. Indeed, large excess of DMPO and PBN, spin trapping agents reactive toward GS· radicals, significantly inhibited peroxidase-induced fluorescence response (Fig. 3) and resulted in the accumulation of characteristic DMPO and PBN spin adducts with GS·. 2G. G. Borisenko, I. Martin, Zhao, A. A. Amoscato, and V. E. Kagan, manuscript in preparation. It is important to note that when phenol was omitted from the incubation system, HRP, H2O2, and GSH did not induce a fluorescence response from Ac-Tempo. This is in agreement with earlier reported data, which indicated that GSH is a relatively poor substrate for HRP (13Kagan V.E. Yalowich J.C. Borisenko G.G. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Thampatty P.

Overall, these results demonstrate that GS· radicals play an important role in the conversion of Ac-Tempo into a fluorescent product. Glutathione Disulfide Anion Radical and Superoxide Anion Radical Are Not Involved in the Conversion of Ac-Tempo into a Non-paramagnetic Fluorescent Product—Because the reaction of GS· radicals with GSH yields the glutathione disulfide anion radical (GSSG.), a reducing radical capable of generating a superoxide anion radical (O2˙−) in the presence of molecular oxygen (Scheme 1), we tested further to determine whether these two radicals could interact with Ac-Tempo during the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of phenol. To this end, we increased GSH concentration significantly to favor GSSG· formation (a predominant reaction of GS· radicals at high GSH levels; Refs. 1Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar and 2Koppenol W.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and to facilitate its interaction with Ac-Tempo. The higher the concentration of GSH used, the lower the rate of fluorescence production observed (Table I). This suggests that, at high concentrations, GSH was able to out-compete Ac-Tempo in the reaction with GS·. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the rate of GS· radical generation increased at higher GSH concentrations resulting in GS· radical recombination and dimerization to GSSG, a competitive reaction with Ac-Tempo. Uncertainty of this result with respect to the role of GSSG· was eliminated by an analysis of Ac-Tempo modification products using MS and HPLC. Only 10% of the products formed were represented by Ac-Tempo hydroxylamine, an anticipated product of the Ac-Tempo reduction by GSSG· (see next paragraph). To determine possible interactions of O2˙− with Ac-Tempo, we utilized Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase. The addition of excess superoxide dismutase (10-100 units/ml) to the incubation mixture containing Ac-Tempo, HRP, H2O2, phenol, and GSH did not alter the rate of EPR signal decrease or the rate of fluorescence generation (Table II). Thus, neither GSSG· nor the superoxide radical are likely to significantly interact with Ac-Tempo. Identification of Products Formed from Ac-Tempo during Peroxidase-catalyzed Oxidation of Phenol in the Presence of H2O2 and GSH—We further used MS to characterize products formed from Ac-Tempo upon its interaction with GS· radicals. We established that HRP in the presence of H2O2, phenol, and GSH converted Ac-Tempo (m/z 377) predominantly into a single product with m/z 362 (Fig. 4A), which corresponded to 4-((9-acridinecarbonyl)amino)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, which we call Ac-piperidine. This was supported by tandem MS analysis. The collision-induced dissociation spectrum confirmed the structure of Ac-piperidine as evidenced"
https://openalex.org/W1977180325,"A functionally important, interface domain between transmembrane segments (TMSs) IV and XI of the NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli has been unraveled. Scanning by single Cys replacements identified new mutations (F136C, G125C, and A137C) that cluster in one face of TMS IV and increase dramatically the Km of the antiporter. Whereas G125C, in addition, causes a drastic alkaline shift to the pH dependence of the antiporter, G338C alleviates the pH control of NhaA. Scanning by double Cys replacements (21 pairs of one replacement per TMS) identified genetically eight pairs of residues that showed very strong negative complementation. Cross-linking of the double mutants identified six double mutants (T132C/G338C, D133C/G338C, F136C/S342C, T132C/S342C, A137C/S342C, and A137C/G338C) of which pronounced intramolecular cross-linking defined an interface domain between the two TMSs. Remarkably, cross-linking by a short and rigid reagent (N,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide) revived the Li+/H+ antiport activity, whereas a shorter reagent (1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate) revived both Na+/H+ and Li+/H+ antiporter activities and even the pH response of the dead mutant T132C/G338C. Hence, cross-linking at this position restores an active conformation of NhaA. A functionally important, interface domain between transmembrane segments (TMSs) IV and XI of the NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli has been unraveled. Scanning by single Cys replacements identified new mutations (F136C, G125C, and A137C) that cluster in one face of TMS IV and increase dramatically the Km of the antiporter. Whereas G125C, in addition, causes a drastic alkaline shift to the pH dependence of the antiporter, G338C alleviates the pH control of NhaA. Scanning by double Cys replacements (21 pairs of one replacement per TMS) identified genetically eight pairs of residues that showed very strong negative complementation. Cross-linking of the double mutants identified six double mutants (T132C/G338C, D133C/G338C, F136C/S342C, T132C/S342C, A137C/S342C, and A137C/G338C) of which pronounced intramolecular cross-linking defined an interface domain between the two TMSs. Remarkably, cross-linking by a short and rigid reagent (N,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide) revived the Li+/H+ antiport activity, whereas a shorter reagent (1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate) revived both Na+/H+ and Li+/H+ antiporter activities and even the pH response of the dead mutant T132C/G338C. Hence, cross-linking at this position restores an active conformation of NhaA. Sodium proton antiporters are ubiquitous membrane proteins found in the cytoplasmic and organelle membranes of cells of many different origins, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. They are involved in cell energetics and play primary roles in the regulation of intracellular pH, cellular Na+ content, and cell volume (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Padan E. Rimon A. Tzuberi T.

Escherichia coli has two antiporters, NhaA (2Padan E. Maisler N. Taglicht D. Karpel R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20297-20302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and NhaB (3Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which specifically exchange Na+ or Li+ for H+. Only NhaA is indispensable for adaptation to high salinity, for challenging Li+ toxicity, and for growth at alkaline pH (in the presence of Na+ (4Padan E. Venturi M. Gerchman Y. Dover N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar)). NhaA is an electrogenic antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Na+ (5Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

The first insight into the architecture of the NhaA protein was obtained by cryoelectron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals, revealing that NhaA is a dimer in which each monomer is composed of 12 TMSs 1The abbreviations used are: TMS, transmembrane segment; BMH, 1,6-bis-(maleimido)hexane; o-PDM, N,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide; MT-S2-MTS, 1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate; ΔpH, pH difference across the membrane; DMF, dimethylformamide; CL-NhaA, His-tagged Cys-less NhaA.1The abbreviations used are: TMS, transmembrane segment; BMH, 1,6-bis-(maleimido)hexane; o-PDM, N,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide; MT-S2-MTS, 1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate; ΔpH, pH difference across the membrane; DMF, dimethylformamide; CL-NhaA, His-tagged Cys-less NhaA.

The Sodium-Hydrogen Exchange, from Molecule to its Role in Disease. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA2003: 35-39Google Scholar), one of the most interesting functional characteristics of NhaA is its dramatic dependence on pH. The rate of activity of NhaA changes over 3 orders of magnitude between pH 7 and 8 (4Padan E. Venturi M. Gerchman Y. Dover N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 5Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activation is accompanied by a conformational change that involves the N terminus as probed by a monoclonal antibody (1F6 (12Venturi M. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Hunte C. Padan E. Michel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4734-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) and loop VIII-IX (Fig. 1) as probed by accessibility of NhaA to trypsin (13Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues that affect the transport activity can be identical to or different from those affecting the pH regulation of NhaA. They are clustered in various domains along the protein (14Galili L. Rothman A. Kozachkov L. Rimon A. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Gerchman Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), implying the need of atomic structure for understanding the mechanism of activity and pH regulation of NhaA. Since atomic resolution of NhaA is not yet available, indirect approaches for structure analysis have been applied. Second site suppressor mutations were isolated to mutation G338S, a pH-conditional lethal mutant that is located in TMS XI and grows on high Na+-selective medium at neutral pH but not at alkaline pH (17Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The suppressor mutations were found clustered in helix IV (A127T, P129L, and A127V) (Fig. 1) (17Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results have suggested that residues in TMSs IV and XI are in close proximity and functionally and/or structurally interact (18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We therefore scanned genetically by Cys replacements conserved residues in TMSs IV and XI and identified new residues that participate in the activity and/or pH regulation of the antiporter. We then constructed double Cys replacements, one in TMS IV and the other in TMS XI, and found that many of the pairs of the Cys replacements exhibited a negative interaction, suggesting functional and/or structural interactions between TMSs IV and XI. However, long range effects can explain interaction between pairs of mutants. Site-directed thiol cross-linking studies have provided considerable insight into the structure of membrane proteins by providing estimates of distances between certain positions in proteins (19Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20Yu H. Kono M. McKee T.D. Oprian D.D.

We have used this approach to probe proximities between periplasmic and cytoplasmic loops of NhaA and found very strong cross-linking within the pairs of Cys replacements S146C/L316C and A118C/S352C (18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), suggesting close proximity between the neighboring TMSs IV and XI. However, since loops can be flexible, the distances obtained are not conclusive. Therefore, in the present work, in addition to the genetic approach, we measured distances between the Cys replacements in TMSs IV and XI by intramolecular site-directed cross-linking and identified several double mutants that strongly cross-linked. Together with the phenotypes of the double mutants, this cross-linking defined an interface between TMSs IV and XI with functional implications. Remarkably, cross-linking of the lethal double mutant T132C/G338C revived both the Na+ and Li+ antiporter activities of the mutant and even its regulation by pH, as would be expected if the cross-linking restored an active conformation of the antiporter.

Cells were also grown in minimal medium A without sodium citrate (24Davies B. Mingioli E. J.

Antibiotics were 100 μg/ml ampicillin and/or 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The resistance to Li+ and Na+ was tested as described previously (2Padan E. Maisler N. Taglicht D. Karpel R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted following a polymerase chain reaction-based protocol (27Ho S. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing of the entire gene, through the ligation junctions with the vector plasmid. For Cys replacement of Gly125, Phe136, and Ala137, pCL-HAH4 was used as a template with the mutagenic primers described in Table I. The resulting plasmids were pCL-HAH4-G125C, pCL-HAH4-F136C, and pCL-HAH4-A137C. For Cys replacement of Leu334 and Ser342, pCL-BstX was used as a template with the mutagenic primers described in Table I. The resulting plasmids were pCL-BstX-L334C and pCL-BstX-S342C. To generate L334C and S342C mutation in pCL-HAH4, the MunI-MluI fragment (571 bp) of pCL-BstX-L334C or pCL-BstX-S342C was ligated with the MunI-MluI fragment (4.17 kb) of pCL-HAH4, yielding pCL-HAH4-L334C and pCL-HAH4-S342C. For Cys replacement of Gly338, pCL-GMAR100 was used as a template with the mutagenic primers described in Table I. The resulting plasmid was pCL-GMAR100-G338C. For construction of this mutation in pCL-AXH (pCL-AXH-G338C), a NheI-MluI fragment (879 bp) of the resulting PCR product was ligated to NheI-MluI (4.1-kb) fragment of pAXH.Table IOligonucleotides used for constructing the Cys mutations in nhaA The mutated bases are shown in boldface type.

Isolation of Membrane Vesicles, Assay of Na+/H+ Antiporter Activity—EP432 cells transformed with the respective plasmids were grown and everted vesicles were prepared and used to determine the Na+/H+ or Li+/H+ antiporter activity as described (28Rosen B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1986; 40: 263-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The assay of antiport activity was based upon the measurement of Na+- or Li+-induced changes in the ΔpH as measured by acridine orange, a fluorescent probe of ΔpH. The fluorescence assay was performed with 2.5 ml of reaction mixture containing 50-100 μg of membrane protein, 0.5 μm acridine orange, 150 mm KCl, 50 mm 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-]amino]propane, 5 mm MgCl2, and the pH was titrated with HCl. Where indicated, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 20 mm diamide (Sigma) was added to the reaction mixture. After energization with either ATP (2 mm) or d-lactate (2 mm), quenching of the fluorescence was allowed to achieve a steady state, and then either Na+ or Li+ (10 or 100 mm each) was added. A reversal of the fluorescence level (dequenching) indicates that protons are exiting the vesicles in antiport with either Na+ or Li+ as indicated (see Figs. 4A and 6A for data of typical experiments). As shown previously, the end level of dequenching is a good estimate of the antiporter activity (31Schuldiner S. Fishkes H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 706-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the concentration of the ion that gives half-maximal dequenching is a good estimate of the apparent Km of the antiporter (31Schuldiner S.

The concentration range of the cations tested was 0.01-100 mm at the indicated pH values, and the apparent Km values were calculated by linear regression of a Lineweaver-Burk plot.Fig. 6Cross-linking rescues the Li+/H+ and Na+/H+ antiporter activity of the double mutant T132C/G338C. Everted membrane vesicles were prepared from EP432 cells expressing CL-NhaA-His6 or mutant T132C/G338C and either treated or not with the indicated cross-linking reagents as described in Fig. 5. The Na+/H+ or Li+/H+ antiporter activity was measured with the acridine orange assay as described in the legend to Fig. 2. A and B, results of typical experiments. C, isolated membrane vesicles of mutant T132C/G338C were treated with MTS-2-MTS (2 mm). The antiporter activity (end level of dequenching as a percentage) was measured either with 100 mm NaCl (open circles) or 100 mm LiCl (closed circles) at the indicated pH values as described above. For comparison, the pH dependence of CL-NhaA is also shown. All experiments were repeated at least three times with practically identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Membranes treated with cross-linking reagents lost the lactate-dependent respiration. Therefore, when such membranes were used in the antiport assay, the membranes were energized by ATP. Detection and Quantitation of NhaA and Its Mutated Proteins in the Membrane—NhaA and its mutated derivatives were quantitated by Western analysis using an anti-NhaA monoclonal antibody 1F6 (33Padan E. Venturi M. Michel H. Hunte C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as described previously (34Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Total membrane protein was determined according to Ref. 35Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar. In Situ Site-directed Inter- and Intramolecular Cross-linking—Site-directed intramolecular cross-linking was conducted in situ on membrane vesicles isolated from TA16 cells expressing the various NhaA double mutants. Membranes (3 mg of protein) were resuspended in a buffer (4.5 ml) containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm MgSO4 (pH 7.4), and one of the freshly prepared homobifunctional cross-linkers: 2 mm BMH (Pierce), 1 mm o-PDM (Sigma), or 2 mm MTS-2-MTS (Toronto Research Chemicals). The stock solutions of the cross-linkers were prepared in DMF at 200 mm, so that the amount of DMF in the reaction mixture does not exceed 1%, a concentration that does not affect the antiporter activity. The suspension was incubated at 26 °C with gentle rotation for 60 min. The reaction with BMH or o-PDM was terminated by the addition of 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and that with MTS-2-MTS, by centrifugation (Beckman; TLA 100.4, 265,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The protein was Ni2+-NTA affinity-purified, treated with trypsin at alkaline pH, and separated on SDS-PAGE (nonreducing conditions in the case of treatment with MTS-2-MTS) to identify the proteolytic products according to Ref. 18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar. Since there is only one trypsin cleavage site at Lys249, located between TMSs IV and XI (Fig. 1), trypsinolysis results in two tryptic peptides of mobility faster than the intact protein. On the other hand, intramolecular cross-linking results in one fragment of mobility equal to that of the intact protein (18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To measure the effect of the cross-linking agents on the activity of the antiporter, everted membrane vesicles were isolated from EP432 expressing the mutations (300 μg of protein); treated with one of the homobifunctional cross-linkers as described above; washed in 1.5 ml containing 140 mm choline chloride, 250 mm sucrose, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); resuspended in 75 μl of the same solution; and used to test antiporter activity. The degree of cross-linking in vesicles derived from EP432 and TA16 was indistinguishable. In situ site-directed intermolecular cross-linking was tested as above but without treatment with trypsin. When intermolecular cross-linking takes place, a band, corresponding in mobility to that of NhaA dimer, appears in SDS-PAGE (15Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E.

Following treatment with the cross-linking reagents, the Ni2+-NTA affinity-purified protein was left bound to the Ni2+-NTA beads, washed with binding buffer (5 mm imidazol, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, and 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, pH 7.4) and exposed to 0.2 mm fluorescein 5-maleimide (Molecular Probes, Inc.; dissolved in Me2SO) to titrate any Cys residue left free. The incubation was for 30 min at 25 °C with gentle tilting. Then the protein was washed and eluted as described in Ref. 36Tzubery T. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol.

Modeling of TMSs IV and XI—Initially, two ideal poly-Ala α-helices were built using the program Moleman (37Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E.

Then the side chains were altered to those of the respective TMS, according to the putative topology model of NhaA (Fig. 1A) (38Rothman A. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

Next, the distances estimated by cross-linking of double Cys replacement mutants located in TMSs IV and XI (see “Results”) and on neighboring loops (18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E.

Construction of Single and Pairs of Cys Replacements in TMSs IV and/or XI of NhaA—In this study, site-directed Cys replacements and site-directed thiol cross-linking were used to identify functional interactions and determine proximities between TMSs IV and XI of NhaA. For this purpose, we used the single Cys replacements mutants (D133C, T132C, P129C, and A127C (14Galili L. Rothman A. Kozachkov L. Rimon A. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)) that had already been constructed in TMS IV and constructed new single Cys replacement mutants: G125C, F136C, and A137C in TMS IV and L334C, G338C, and S342C in TMS XI (Tables I and II and Fig. 1). All old and new mutations replace conserved amino acid residues (Fig. 1). We then constructed double mutants, each containing one replacement in TMS IV and one in TMS XI (Table II and Fig. 1). All mutants, both single and double, were constructed in plasmid-encoded CL-NhaA that is very similar to the wild type protein in transport activity and pH regulation (25Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Table II). To determine the level of expression, growth phenotype, and antiporter activity, the plasmids encoding the mutants were transformed into EP432, an E. coli strain devoid of both Na+-specific antiporters NhaA and NhaB (3Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This strain can grow in the presence of high Na+ or Li+ only when transformed with a plasmid expressing active NhaA (3Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Table II (compare EP432/pCL-HAH4 with EP432/pBR322). The results summarized in Table II show that the single and double mutants were expressed to a level that ranges between 10 and 100% of the control level (EP432/pCL-HAH4). It should be stressed that because all mutants are expressed from multicopy plasmids, even the lowest level of expression observed here is significant, readily detected by Western analysis, and way above the level expressed from a single chromosomal gene that is hardly detected by Western analysis (17Rimon A.

By using peptide scanning, we identified four regions in IL-15. The first region (85CKECEELEEKN95) is located in the C-D loop and is recognized by a set of non-inhibitory antibodies. The second region (102SFVHIVQMFIN112) is located in helix D and is recognized by two antibodies that are inhibitory of IL-15 bio-activity but not of IL-15 binding to IL-15Rα. The two remaining regions react with a recombinant soluble form of the IL-15Rα; the first (44LLELQVISL52, peptide 1) corresponds to a sequence located in the B-helix and the second (64ENLII68, peptide 2) to a sequence located in helix C. The latter is also contained in the epitope recognized by an antibody (monoclonal antibody B-E29) that prevents IL-15 binding to IL-15Rα. By site-directed mutagenesis, we confirmed that residues present in peptide 1 (Leu-45, Glu-46, Val-49, Ser-51, and Leu-52) and peptide 2 (Leu-66 and Ile-67) are involved in the binding of IL-15 to IL-15Rα. Furthermore, the results presented indicate that residues in the second peptide (Glu-64, Asn-65, and Ile-68) participate in IL-2Rβ recruitment.

https://openalex.org/W1969218808,"H1 linker histones are involved in packaging chromatin into 30-nm fibers and higher order structures. Most eukaryotic cells contain nearly one H1 molecule for each nucleosome core particle. Male germ cells in mammals contain large amounts of a germ cell-specific linker histone, HIST1HT, herein denoted H1t, which is particularly abundant in pachytene spermatocytes. Despite its abundance in male germ cells and significant divergence in primary sequence from other H1 subtypes, inactivation of the H1t gene in mice showed that it is not required for spermatogenesis. Analysis of germ cell chromatin from H1t null mice showed that other H1 subtypes, especially the testis-enriched HIST1H1A, herein denoted as the H1a subtype, were able to compensate for the absence of H1t to maintain a normal total H1 to nucleosome core ratio. To disrupt the compensation, we generated H1t and H1a double null mice by two sequential gene-targeting steps in embryonic stem cells. Elimination of both H1t and H1a led to a 25% decrease in the ratio of H1 to nucleosome cores in double null germ cells. Surprisingly, the reduction in H1 did not perturb spermatogenesis or produce detectable defects in meiotic processes. Microarray analysis of gene expression showed that the reduced linker histone levels did not affect global gene expression, but it did cause changes in expression of specific genes. Our results indicate that a partial reduction in linker histone-nucleosome core particle stoichiometry is tolerated in developing male germ cells.

Our results indicate that a partial reduction in linker histone-nucleosome core particle stoichiometry is tolerated in developing male germ cells. Histones are small, basic proteins that are unique to eukaryotes and found in all eukaryotic nuclei. Histones are involved in packaging DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. There are five major classes of histones, the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, and the linker histone H1. Two molecules of each of the core histones constitute the protein octamer of the nucleosome core particle. H1 histones bind to the linker DNA between nucleosome core particles and facilitate the folding of nucleosomes into the 30-nm chromatin fiber and higher order chromatin structures (1Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar, 2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin-Structure & Function. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Therefore, they would be expected to have profound effects on many cellular processes that require access to the genome. A general feature of histone proteins is that their amino acid sequences are conserved. However, the H1 family of histones is the most diverse class, with multiple subtypes in most organisms (3Cole R.D. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In mice eight H1 subtypes have been described (4Lennox R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 669-672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tanaka M. Hennebold J.D. Macfarlane J. Adashi E.Y. Development. 2001; 128: 655-664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including the “somatic” subtypes H1a through H1e, the replacement subtype H1FO (here H1o), the oocyte-specific H1FOO, here denoted as H1oo, and the testis-specific H1t. These subtypes are also present in humans, and the genomic organization of the genes encoding the H1 subtypes appears to be very similar in humans and mice (6Drabent B. Louroutziatis A. Prats E. Cornudella L. Doenecke D. DNA Seq. 1995; 6: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 7Wang Z.F. Krasikov T. Frey M.R. Wang J. Matera A.G. Marzluff W.F. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 688-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although all of the mouse H1 subtypes have the basic tripartite structure of metazoan H1s, they do differ extensively in amino acid sequences, with H1o, H1oo, and H1t being the most divergent subtypes. The different subtypes also exhibit distinct expression patterns during development, with the tissue-specific H1oo and H1t being the most extreme examples. Certain H1 subtypes can constitute a major portion of the linker histones in specific cell types. For example, H1t represents 40-50% of the H1 in pachytene spermatocytes (8Meistrich M.L. Bucci L.R. Trostle-Weige P.K. Brock W.A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 112: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because linker histones are nearly equimolar with nucleosome core particles in most higher eukaryotic cells, this implies that in some cell types a large fraction of the nucleosomes contains a particular H1 subtype, e.g. H1t in developing spermatocytes. Nevertheless, gene inactivation experiments in mice have shown that elimination of any one of several of these subtypes does not disrupt normal development, even in tissues in which the specific subtypes are highly abundant (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Fan Y. Sirotkin A. Russell R.G. Ayala J. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell.

Reprod. 2001; 64: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For example, mice lacking H1t were fertile and showed no detectable defect in spermatogenesis (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 13Drabent B. Saftig P. Bode C. Doenecke D. Histochem.

Reprod. 2001; 64: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for the absence of a phenotype in these single H1 null animals is that other H1 subtypes compensate for the lost subtype. Consistent with this view, analysis of chromatin from such mice showed that indeed the levels of other subtypes are increased so as to maintain a normal ratio of total H1 linker histones to nucleosome core particles (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, one approach to investigating the in vivo roles of linker histones in mammals is to attempt to reduce the stoichiometry of H1 to nucleosome core particles by generating compound H1 null cells or mice. This is an arduous task for most H1 subtypes, because the genes for six of the eight subtypes are tightly linked on mouse chromosome 13 (7Wang Z.F. Krasikov T. Frey M.R. Wang J. Matera A.G. Marzluff W.F. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 688-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We reported previously that in Hist1h1tm1Ais/Hist1h1tm1Ais (denoted H1t-/- or H1t-null) germ cells, the H1a subtype constitutes more than 50% of the remaining H1 (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated H1t and H1a null mice by two sequential gene-targeting steps in mouse embryonic stem (ES) 1The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; OA, okadaic acid. cells. The double null germ cells from such mice have a 25% decrease in ratio of H1 to nucleosomes. Remarkably, the reduction in H1-to-nucleosome stoichiometry did not perturb spermatogenesis or cause any apparent meiotic abnormalities, nor did it affect global gene expression. However, changes in expression of certain genes were found. Disruption of the H1a Gene in ES Cells and Generation of Chimeric Mice—The genomic DNA clones used in construction of the H1a targeting vector were isolated by screening a 129X1/SvJ (briefly, 129X1) genomic library as described previously (15Dong Y. Sirotkin A.M. Yang Y.S. Brown D.T. Sittman D.B. Skoultchi A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To generate an H1a targeting vector (Fig. 1A), a 1.2-kb SacII-TthIII fragment was inserted into the XbaI site of pTK-KS vector by blunt-end ligation as the short 5′-arm (Fig. 1A). The pTK-KS vector already contains a PGK-TK cassette. Then a 6.5-kb EcoRI fragment was inserted into the EcoRI site of the plasmid as the long 3′-arm. Finally, a PGK-Hygro cassette was blunt-end-inserted into the BamHI site of the plasmid in between these two arms. To generate ES cells with a targeted disruption at the H1a locus, 25-50 μg of NotI-linearized H1a targeting vector (Fig.1A) were electroporated into 2-4 × 107 T3-12 ES cells containing a disrupted H1t allele, as described previously (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The T3-12 ES cell line was shown previously to provide very good germ-line transmission of the disrupted H1t allele. ES cell clones resistant to 180 μg/ml G418, 150 μg/ml hygromycin, and 2 μm gancyclovir were picked after 9-10 days and transferred to duplicate 48-well plates. Ten ES clones containing a modified H1a allele were identified among 192 triply resistant clones analyzed by Southern blot hybridization (Fig.1B). Four clones (D18, D32, E43, and E45) were injected into C57BL/6-recipient blastocysts, and the blastocysts were transferred to CD-1 pseudo-pregnant females to generate chimeric mice as described previously (16Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). Mouse tail DNA was prepared as described previously (16Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). Preparation and Analysis of Histones—Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the testes were excised and immediately rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Seminiferous epithelial cells were prepared as previously described (17Bellve A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 84-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 18Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The germ cells were isolated from testes, chromatin was prepared from the nuclei of the isolated spermatogenetic cells, and histone proteins were extracted from the chromatin with 0.2 n sulfuric acid and fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The effluent was monitored at 214 nm, and peak areas were determined with a Hewlett Packard peak integrator program. The percentage of each H1 subtype in the samples was calculated by measuring the ratio of each peak area to the total area of all H1 peaks after normalizing for differences in the number of amino acids in the individual H1 species. The ratio of total H1 to nucleosomes was calculated by dividing the total area of all H1 peaks by one-half the area of the H2b peak after normalizing for differences in the number of amino acids in H2b and an average sized H1 molecule. Germ Cell Culture and Treatment—Isolated testicular germ cells were prepared as described previously (17Bellve A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 84-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and washed and resuspended in HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 25 mm NaCHO3, 5% v/v fetal bovine serum, 20 mm sodium lactate, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (19Wiltshire T. Park C. Caldwell K.A. Handel M.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The cells were plated at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in 4-well Nunclon dishes and were cultured at 32 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. After a 2-h recovery period, the cells were treated with 5 μm okadaic acid (OA) for 4 h. An equal volume of the solvent, 100% EtOH, was added to the control wells. Air-dried Chromosome Preparations—Chromosome condensation was assessed in air-dried chromosomes prepared by a modification of the Evans procedure (20Evans E.P. Breckon G. Ford C.E. Cytogenetics. 1964; 3: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 106 cultured cells were pooled and pelleted by centrifugation. After washing in 2.2% sodium citrate, the cells were allowed to swell in a 1% (hypotonic) sodium citrate solution. After swelling, the testicular germ cells were fixed in a 3:1 absolute ethanol/glacial acetic acid solution. The cells were dropped onto a prewarmed slide and allowed to air dry. The air-dried cell preparations were stained with Giemsa and scored for the presence of meiotic metaphase I figures or other degrees of chromosome condensation using brightfield optics with a 40× objective. Surface-spread Chromatin Preparations—Cells were fixed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.03% SDS as previously described (21Cobb J. Reddy R.K. Park C. Handel M.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The antisera used were polyclonal anti-SYCP3 (22Eaker S. Pyle A. Cobb J. Handel M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2953-2965PubMed Google Scholar), anti-phospho-H2AX (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-histone H1t (23Inselman A. Eaker S. Handel M.A. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 103: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and anti-phospho-histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies, conjugated with either rhodamine or fluorescein, were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Coverslips were mounted with Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) containing 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize the DNA. Localization was detected with a 100× objective on an Olympus epifluorescence microscope. Images were captured to Adobe Photoshop with a Hamamatsu C5810 color chilled charge-coupled device camera. Histological Analysis of Mouse Testes—Testes were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined as described previously (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Epididymal sperm numbers were determined by counting with a hemocytometer as described previously (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Microarray Procedures—A description of the microarray hardware and procedures used in this study are available from www.aecom.yu.edu/home/molgen/facilities.html. cDNA fluorescent probe preparation, prehybridization, and hybridization were performed as described (24Wei Y. Harris T. Childs G. Differentiation. 2003; 70: 204-219Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, for cDNA microarray analysis, RNA was extracted from germ cells of wild-type and H1a, H1t null littermate male mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 100 μg of total RNA pooled from the germ cells of three males were used in each experiment. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed in the presence of Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP with Superscript II RT. The cDNA products from wild-type and mutant cells were combined and purified on a Micron YM 50 column and hybridized to a 9000+ gene mouse cDNA microarray overnight at 50 °C. Hybridized cDNA microarrays were washed and scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000, and signal intensities were extracted. Four replicate array hybridization experiments were carried out, with the dyes were exchanged between the samples in the experiments. Microarray Quality Control and Data Analysis—The spot intensity was extracted from the array image using GenePix Pro 3.0 as described (24Wei Y. Harris T. Childs G. Differentiation. 2003; 70: 204-219Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the intensity data file was imported into R statistical packages for data analysis. To ensure the quality of spots used in data analysis, the statistical t test between spot intensity and surrounding background intensity was carried out for each spot of each channel. The spots with p > 0.001 for both Cy3 and Cy5 channels were eliminated from further analysis. The intensities of the remaining spots were adjusted by subtracting the surrounding background intensity from the spot intensity. The ratio of the experimental sample over the control sample was calculated and further log transformed with base 2 (denoted as log2 R/G, where R and G are the intensities of the experimental sample and the control sample, respectively), because the log-ratios form a more normal distribution than the ratios. To avoid systematic errors such as unequal loading of cDNA samples and bias of dye labeling and incorporation, intensity-dependent normalization within the array was performed to balance the intensities of both channels by applying a Lowess smooth fit function to the distribution of log-ratio (log2 R/G) and log-intensity (1/2 log R*G) (25Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar). The correlation coefficient of normalized log-ratios for all spots between two replicates was calculated to determine the good reproducibility of the replicates, and a cutoff for the correlation coefficient of 0.5 was used. To identify differentially regulated genes, the filtered data was imported into an Access data base and queried for genes with the median of log2 of ratios ≥ 0.58 or ≤ -0.58 considered to be up-regulated (1.5-fold or more) or down-regulated (1.5-fold or more), respectively, and a p value of <0.05 of statistical t test on the repeated measurements. A cutoff of 0.584 for the median of log-ratios was determined by data from a number of arrays generated by the same array platform and experimental procedure as performed in this study. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from male germ cells and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (26Rao G. Rekhtman N. Cheng G. Krasikov T. Skoultchi A.I. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Generation of ES Cells with Disrupted Alleles of Both H1a and H1t—To generate ES cells with disrupted H1a and H1t genes, we utilized a previously described ES cell clone (T3-12) in which one allele of the H1t gene had been inactivated and replaced with a PGK-Neo cassette (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The mouse H1a gene does not contain introns, and it encodes a protein of 213 amino acids. The single short exon of the H1a gene enabled us to replace the entire H1a coding sequence with a selection marker. The H1a targeting vector (Fig. 1A) contained a PGK-Hygro cassette that allows positive selection for transfectants with hygromycin and a PGK-TK cassette that allows negative selection with gancyclovir. Homologous recombination between the targeting construct and the endogenous H1a locus resulted in the generation of a modified H1a allele in which the entire H1a coding sequence was replaced by the PGK-Hygro cassette (Fig. 1A). The targeting vector was linearized by NotI digestion, electroporated into T3-12 ES cells, and cells resistant to G418, hygromycin, and gancyclovir were selected. The gancyclovir-negative selection resulted in a 4-fold enrichment of G418 and hygromycin-resistant clones. DNA from a total of 192-resistant clones was screened by both recombination-specific PCR and Southern blot hybridization with a 5′ probe lying outside of the H1a targeting construct (Fig. 1A). Ten positive clones in which a homologous recombination event had occurred at the H1a locus were identified (examples shown in Fig. 1B). Southern blot analyses with a H1t gene-specific 5′ probe (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) confirmed that all ten clones were H1t (+/-), indicating that the disrupted H1t allele was not lost during ES cell propagation and passage (data not shown). The targeting of the H1a allele can occur in cis or in trans to the previously inactivated H1t allele. The former type of event can be used to generate H1a, H1t double mutant mice, whereas the latter type of event can be used to generate H1a mutant animals. Generation of H1a-null Mice and H1a- and H1t-double-null Mice—To generate both H1a homozygous mutant mice and mice homozygous mutant for both H1a and H1t, four ES clones (D18, D32, E43, and E45) containing disrupted H1a and H1t alleles (Fig. 1B) were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. All four cell lines gave rise to chimeras ranging in chimerism from 50% to 99% as judged by coat color. Two to four male chimeras from each line were mated with C57BL/6 females. All males mated produced agouti progeny, indicating that all four ES cell lines contributed to the germ line. Some agouti progeny from all four lines were shown to contain the disrupted H1a allele by PCR (Fig. 1C). These results were confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). By analyzing the genotypes of the agouti animals at both the H1a and H1t loci it is possible to determine whether the targeting of the H1a gene occurred in cis or trans to the inactivated H1t allele. All agouti progeny from D18 and E43 double-targeted ES cells were either heterozygous at H1a or heterozygous at H1t (Fig. 1C, left panel), indicating that the mutated H1a allele and the disrupted H1t allele were in trans in these two lines. On the other hand, all agouti progeny from the D32 and E45 cell lines were either wild-type at H1a and H1t loci or heterozygous at both loci (Fig. 1C, right panel), suggesting that the mutated H1a and H1t alleles were located on the same chromosome in these two lines. Mice heterozygous for either the H1a mutation or both the H1a and H1t mutations were phenotypically normal. To determine the possible effects of the H1a mutation alone, mice derived from the D18 and E43 cell lines and heterozygous for the modified H1a allele were interbred, and tail DNA from the progeny was analyzed by PCR or Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 1D, left panel). Of 197 animals analyzed by either PCR or Southern blot hybridization, 43 (22%) carried only wild-type H1a alleles, 111 (56%) had one copy of the H1a modified allele, and 43 (22%) carried two copies of the H1a-mutated allele. The ratio of the three classes of mice is consistent with Mendelian transmission of the two alleles. H1a homozygous mice were normal in size and body weight (Table I), and they were indistinguishable from heterozygous and wild-type littermates. Male H1a-/- mice also did not exhibit any abnormalities in spermatogenesis by several criteria. They were fertile, producing litters of normal size, and both their testis weight and epididymal sperm numbers were normal (Table I). No abnormalities were detected in testis histology. These results are consistent with an earlier report (12Rabini S. Franke K. Saftig P. Bode C. Doenecke D. Drabent B. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) indicating that mutation of the mouse H1a gene does not impair normal development or spermatogenesis.Table IBody weight, testis weight, and sperm numbers of wild-type and H1a or H1a/H1t mutant miceGenotypeBody wt.Testis wt.Sperm no.gmg×107H1a (+/+)31.0 ± 1.897.8 ± 8.23.4 ± 1.1H1a (+/−)30.1 ± 1.9101.5 ± 13.62.8 ± 0.7H1a (−/−)34.5 ± 1.795.7 ± 7.24.5 ± 1.2H1a/H1t(+/+, +/+)35.1 ± 3.5105.2 ± 10.43.7 ± 1.2H1a/H1t(+/−, +/−)34.9 ± 6.1101.2 ± 10.13.0 ± 1.1H1a/H1t(−/−, −/−)34.4 ± 5.290.0 ± 12.22.7 ± 1.0 Open table in a new tab Because the entire H1a coding region was deleted in the modified H1a allele, H1a-/- mice would be expected to lack H1a protein. To demonstrate that homozygous mutant animals do not have H1a protein, total histone extracts of germ cell chromatin were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. The HPLC chromatogram of germ cell histones from wild-type animals had a peak eluting at ∼50 min (Fig. 2A), which is absent in germ cell histone extracts from H1a-/- animals (Fig. 2B). To prove that this peak is indeed H1a, we collected the material eluting in this position and subjected it to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The mass spectrograph showed a single component with a molecular mass of 21,705 Da (data not shown), consistent with the expected size of H1a protein (21,790 Da) predicted from the H1a gene sequence after accounting for cleavage and acetylation of the resulting N-terminal serine. Because this peak is missing from germ cells extracts of H1a-/- mice, we conclude that the modified H1a allele is indeed a null mutation. The H1a peak was also not present in extracts of liver and spleen from the H1a-/- mice (data not shown). Reduced H1 Content in Germ Cells of Mice Null for Both H1a and H1t—To generate animals null for both H1a and H1t, H1a+/-, H1t+/- mice derived from cell lines D32 and E45 (in which the mutant H1a and H1t alleles were linked) were intercrossed and tail DNA from the F2 progeny was analyzed by PCR or Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 1D, right panel). Of 171 animals analyzed by these methods, 39 (23%) carried only wild-type alleles, 88 (51%) had one copy of the mutated H1a and H1t alleles, and 44 (26%) carried two copies of the chromosome containing both the H1a and H1t null alleles. The ratio of the three classes of mice is consistent with Mendelian transmission of the doubly mutated chromosome. H1a, H1t double homozygous mutant mice were normal in weight and size, and they were indistinguishable from heterozygous and wild-type littermates (Table I). These results indicate that the presence of both the modified H1a allele and the disrupted H1t allele does not impair normal development. Because both the H1a and H1t disruptions are null mutations, it is expected that H1a-/-, H1t-/- mice would be completely lacking both H1a and H1t proteins. This expectation was confirmed by HPLC analysis of total histone extracts of male germ cell chromatin from such mice (Fig. 2C). To determine the effect of eliminating both H1a and H1t on the H1 subtype composition and H1-to-nucleosome stoichiometry, we analyzed these parameters by HPLC of extracts from germ cell chromatin of wild-type and homozygous double mutant male littermates. As shown in Fig. 2A, this method resolves the H1 histones in male germ cells into six peaks; H1d and H1e migrate as a single peak and therefore their amounts cannot be estimated separately unless the peak containing them is collected and subjected to mass spectrometry (27Wang Z.F. Sirotkin A.M. Buchold G.M. Skoultchi A.I. Marzluff W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As discussed previously (11Sirotkin A.M. Edelmann W. Cheng G. Klein-Szanto A. Kucherlapati R. Skoultchi A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6434-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the HPLC analysis also allows an estimate of the amount of linker histones in cells relative to nucleosomes, by measuring the total amount of all of the H1 subtypes relative to a nucleosomal histone such as H2B. Quantitative measurements from analyses like that shown in Fig. 2, performed on germ cell chromatin from five 3-month-old wild-type and H1a-/-, H1t-/- littermates showed that elimination of both H1a and H1t caused a 25% reduction in the total H1-to-nucleosme ratio, from 0.78 in wild-type germ cells to 0.59 (Table IIb). The value for this ratio in wild-type germ cells is in good agreement with our previous measurements (9Lin Q. Sirotkin A. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and it is quite similar to measurements we have reported in other tissues (10Fan Y. Sirotkin A. Russell R.G. Ayala J.

To further define their roles in regulating myogenesis, the function of wild type and dominant-negative forms of Gli2 and Meox1 were examined in the context of differentiating P19 stem cells. We found that Gli2 overexpression up-regulated transcript levels of Meox1 and, conversely, Meox1 overexpression resulted in the upregulation of Gli2 transcripts. Furthermore, dominant-negative forms of either Meox1 or Gli2 disrupted the ability of P19 cells to commit to the muscle lineage and to properly express either Gli2 or Meox1, respectively. Finally, Pax3 transcripts were induced by Gli2 overexpression and lost in the presence of either mutants Meox1 or Gli2. Taken together, these results support the existence of a regulatory loop between Gli2, Meox1, and Pax3 that is essential for specification of mesodermal cells into the muscle lineage.

IntroductionSkeletal muscle development occurs in the somite of the developing embryo. Somites give rise to the sclerotome, dermomyotome, and myotome. Differentiation of epaxial muscle in the myotome is controlled by the myogenic regulatory factor family of muscle-specific transcription factors, including MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4 (1Buckingham M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 440-448Google Scholar, 2Bailey P. Holowacz T. Lassar A.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 679-689Google Scholar). Signaling factors from tissues surrounding the somite, including Wnts and Sonic hedgehog (Shh), 1The abbreviations used are: Shh, sonic hedgehog; Gli/EnR, replacement of the Gli2 activation domain with the engrailed repressor domain; P19(Gli2), P19 cells overexpressing Gli2; Meox/EnR, fusion of the engrailed repressor domain to the C terminus of Meox1; MRF, myogenic regulatory factor; MHC, myosin heavy chain; RT, reverse transcriptase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase. direct the processes of somite patterning and subsequent skeletal muscle development in the myotome (3Stern H.M.

Schmidt C. Nikowits Jr., W. Christ B. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 86-94Google Scholar). Several transcription factors appear to mediate the response to signals from surrounding tissues and regulate the commitment of cells into the muscle lineage. These include Gli2 (7Gustafsson M.K. Pan H. Pinney D.F. Liu Y. Lewandowski A. Epstein D.J. Emerson Jr., C.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 114-126Google Scholar, 8Borycki A. Brown A.M. Emerson C.P. Development. 2000; 127: 2075-2087Google Scholar), Pax3 (9Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 21Google Scholar, 10Maroto M. Reshef R. Munsterberg A.E. Koester S. Goulding M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15393-15399Google Scholar).Wnt and Shh cooperate in the activation of the Gli genes in avian somite formation (8Borycki A. Brown A.M. Emerson C.P. Development. 2000; 127: 2075-2087Google Scholar). The Drosophila homolog of the Gli family of zinc finger transcription factors, cubitus interruptus, is a downstream effector of Shh signaling in the fly (14Alexandre C. Jacinto A. Ingham P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2003-2013Google Scholar). The Gli family, including Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3, are all expressed in the developing somite (15Hui C.C. Slusarski D. Platt K.A. Holmgren R. Joyner A.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 402-413Google Scholar). Further analysis in avian embryos indicate that Gli1 is expressed predominantly in the ventromedial somite, whereas Gli2 and Gli3 become restricted to the dorsomedial somite, which gives rise to the epaxial myotome (8Borycki A. Brown A.M. Emerson C.P. Development. 2000; 127: 2075-2087Google Scholar). Their expression pattern suggests that the Gli factors may play a role in the commitment of cells to the skeletal muscle pathway. Indeed, the Gli factors regulate the maintenance of Myf-5 expression in the early somite, although initial activation is independent of Shh function and an intact Gli binding site (7Gustafsson M.K. Pan H. Pinney D.F. Liu Y. Lewandowski A. Epstein D.J. Emerson Jr., C.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 114-126Google Scholar, 16Teboul L. Summerbell D. Rigby P.W.

The Glis also play a role in MRF expression and skeletal muscle development in Zebrafish (18van Eeden F.J. Granato M. Schach U. Brand M. Furutani-Seiki M. Haffter P. Hammerschmidt M. Heisenberg C.P. Jiang Y.J. Kane D.A. Kelsh R.N. Mullins M.C. Odenthal J. Warga R.M. Allende M.L. Weinberg E.S. Nusslein-Volhard C. Development. 1996; 123: 153-164Google Scholar, 19Karlstrom R.O. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 388-393Google Scholar) and Xenopus (20Marine J.C. Bellefroid E.J. Pendeville H. Martial J.A. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 211-225Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest a conserved role for the Gli factors in regulating the expression of the myogenic regulatory factors, leading to skeletal muscle development.Pax3 and Pax7 are functionally similar members of a family of paired box transcription factors (21Mansouri A. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 141-149Google Scholar). Pax3 was found to be initially expressed throughout the somite before becoming restricted to the dermomyotome and the cells that migrate to the limb bud (22Goulding M. Lumsden A. Paquette A.J. Development. 1994; 120: 957-971Google Scholar, 23Williams B.A. Ordahl C.P. Development. 1994; 120: 785-796Google Scholar). The splotch mouse carries a mutant allele of the Pax3 gene (24Epstein D.J. Vogan K.J. Trasler D.G. Gros P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 532-536Google Scholar). Splotch mutant embryos were devoid of muscle precursors that migrate from the dermomyotome to populate the limb bud, whereas epaxial muscle appeared unaffected (22Goulding M. Lumsden A. Paquette A.J. Development. 1994; 120: 957-971Google Scholar, 25Bober E. Franz T. Arnold H.H. Gruss P. Tremblay P. Development. 1994; 120: 603-612Google Scholar). Because Pax7 expression was shown to be expanded into regions that normally express only Pax3 in Splotch mutant embryos (26Borycki A.G. Li J. Jin F. Emerson C.P. Epstein J.A. Development. 1999; 126: 1665-1674Google Scholar), it is likely that Pax7 compensated for the loss of Pax3 in epaxial muscle.A cross between the Splotch mouse and the Myf-5-null mouse implied a role for Pax3 in epaxial muscle, because both epaxial and hypaxial muscle precursors were lost in double mutant embryos (11Tajbakhsh S. Rocancourt D. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Cell. 1997; 89: 127-138Google Scholar). The lack of MyoD in the double mutant indicated that MyoD is regulated by both Pax3 and Myf-5. Overexpression of Pax3 in avian paraxial mesoderm induced MyoD, Myf-5, and myogenin expression (10Maroto M. Reshef R. Munsterberg A.E. Koester S. Goulding M. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 139-148Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative Pax3 in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells resulted in a loss of MyoD and myogenin expression and subsequent myogenesis (9Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 21Google Scholar). Together these studies indicate a crucial role for Pax3 in activating the expression of the myogenic regulatory factors in the myotome.Meox1 and Meox2 are closely related homeobox proteins expressed in the early developing somite (27Candia A.F. Hu J. Crosby J. Lalley P.A. Noden D. Nadeau J.H. Wright C.V. Development. 1992; 116: 1123-1136Google Scholar). At later stages, Meox1 was found in the dermomyotome, whereas Meox2 was found in the developing limb bud (27Candia A.F. Hu J. Crosby J. Lalley P.A. Noden D. Nadeau J.H. Wright C.V. Development. 1992; 116: 1123-1136Google Scholar, 28Candia A.F. Wright C.V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 1179-1184Google Scholar), suggesting Meox1 and Meox2 may regulate epaxial and hypaxial muscle development, respectively. Meox2-null mice exhibited down-regulation in Pax3 and Myf-5 expression and a decrease in differentiated muscle in the limb (12Mankoo B.S. Collins N.S. Ashby P. Grigorieva E. Pevny L.H. Candia A. Wright C.V. Rigby P.W. Pachnis V. Nature. 1999; 400: 69-73Google Scholar), consistent with a role for Meox2 in hypaxial muscle development. Interestingly, Meox factors have been shown to interact with members of the Pax family (29Stamataki D. Kastrinaki M. Mankoo B.S. Pachnis V. Karagogeos D. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 274-278Google Scholar), although the effect of this interaction on activity of Meox and Pax during muscle development is not yet known.We have shown previously that Wnt signaling via β-catenin is essential and sufficient for the expression of Pax3, Meox1, and Gli2, and the subsequent induction of skeletal myogenesis in aggregated P19 cells (13Petropoulos H. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15393-15399Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pax3 expression is essential and sufficient for the expression of the transcription factor Six1 and the induction of skeletal myogenesis (9Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 21Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pax3 did not activate the expression of Gli2 and Gli2 expression was not lost in cell lines expressing a dominant-negative Pax3 mutant. Conversely, Meox1 expression was induced by Pax3 overexpression and down-regulated in the absence of functional Pax3. These results suggest a complex relationship between Gli2, Pax3, and Meox1.To study the roles of Gli2 and Meox1 in skeletal myogenesis, we examined the function of wild type and dominant-negative forms of Meox1 and Gli2 in the context of aggregated P19 cells. Gli2 was shown to up-regulate the expression of Meox1, Pax3, and the MRFs leading to low levels of skeletal muscle development. Dominant-negative Gli2, termed Gli/EnR, inhibited skeletal myogenesis and resulted in the down-regulation of Meox1, Pax3, and MRF expression. Meox1 activated the expression of Gli2 but could not induce Pax3 expression or skeletal myogenesis. However, dominant-negative Meox1, termed Meox/EnR, down-regulated Pax3 and Gli2 expression and inhibited skeletal myogenesis. Together, these data indicate that overexpression of Gli2, but not Meox1, is sufficient to induce low levels of skeletal myogenesis, whereas either Meox or Gli factors, or genes with Meox or Gli binding sites, are essential for skeletal myogenesis in P19 cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Constructs—Gli1 and Gli2 cDNA, both driven by the CMV promoter, were kindly provided by H. Sasaki (30Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Google Scholar). To construct the Gli/EnR chimera, the C-terminal domain of Gli2, which includes the activation domain, was removed by utilizing ApaI. This deletion corresponds to the ΔC4 mutant that could not activate a multimerized Gli-site promoter in transfection assays (30Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Google Scholar). The remaining N terminus of Gli2, containing the zinc finger domain, was fused to the 198-amino acid N-terminal repression domain of the mouse EN-2 protein. The engrailed repression domain was amplified by PCR utilizing oligonucleotides 5′-AAGGGCCCGGGAGGAGAAGGATTCCAAGCCC and 3′-AAGCGGCCGCCTAGCCCAGAGTGGCGCTGGCTT. The 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides contained ApaI and NotI sites, respectively (bold), to facilitate cloning and the 3′-oligonucleotide contained a stop codon (underlined). Gli/EnR was subcloned into the PGK vector, which contains the phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk-1) promoter (31Adra C.N. Boer P.H. McBurney M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 65-74Google Scholar). The PGK-Puro and PGK-LacZ constructs were described previously (32Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Google Scholar).Meox1 cDNA was kindly provided by B. Mankoo. The Meox1 cDNA was subcloned into the PGK vector using SacI/KpnI. To construct the Meox/EnR chimera, Meox1 cDNA was amplified utilizing oligonucleotides 5′-AAGAGCTCCAGCAGATGGATCCAGTG and 3′-AAGGTACCGATATCCTCTGAACTTGGAGAAGCTGC and subcloned into pGEM® T-Easy (Promega) vector (the start codon is underlined). The Meox1 cDNA was cut out using SacI/KpnI and subcloned into the PGK-vector by utilizing SacI/KpnI sites. The engrailed repression domain was amplified by PCR utilizing oligonucleotides 5′-AAGATATCGAGGAGAAGGATTCCAAGCCC and 3′-AAGATATCCTAGCCCAGAGTGGCGCTGGCTT. The 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotides contained EcoRV sites (bold) to facilitate cloning and the 3′-oligonucleotide contained a stop codon (underlined). The 198-amino acid N-terminal repression domain of the mouse EN-2 protein was then fused to the C terminus of the Meox1 cDNA by subcloning the amplified engrailed repression domain into the PGK-Meox1 vector by utilizing EcoRV. The activation domain of Meox1 is currently unknown and thus was not removed prior to construction of the Meox/EnR chimera.Cell Culture and Transfections—P19 cells were cultured as described (33Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Animal. 1999; 35: 175-177Google Scholar) in α-minimum essential media supplemented with 5% Cosmic calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 5% fetal bovine serum (CanSera, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada). Stable cell lines were isolated as described previously (9Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 21Google Scholar, 32Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, CMV-Gli2 and CMV-Gli2/engrailed were stably transfected using the FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC, Canada). A mixture containing 2.04 μg of CMV-Gli2, CMV-Gli2/engrailed, or PGK vector alone for controls, and 0.09 μg of PGK-puro, 0.17 μg of PGK-LacZ, 0.77 μg of B17 was used to create the Gli2 cell lines. A mixture containing 6 μg of PGK-Meox1, PGK-Meox1/engrailed, or PGK vector alone for controls, and 0.25 μg of PGK-puro, 0.50 μg of PGK-LacZ, and 2.25 μg of B17 was used to create the Meox1 cell lines. For all stable transfections, a mixture of DNA with FuGENE 6 reagent was added to 2.5 × 105 cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Transfection efficiency for each experiment was assessed by β-galactosidase assays as described (38Norton P.A. Coffin J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 281-290Google Scholar). Cells were selected for puromycin resistance (2 μg/ml) for 7–9 days. Resulting colonies were tested for expression by slot blot analysis and stable cells lines were isolated and termed P19(Gli2), P19(Gli/EnR), P19(Meox1), P19(Meox/EnR), or P19(control) cells.P19(control), P19(Gli2), and P19(Meox1) cells were differentiated in the absence of Me2SO and P19(control), P19(Gli/EnR), and P19(Meox/EnR) cells were differentiated in the presence of 0.8% Me2SO, as described (9Ridgeway A.G.

Differentiation involved aggregation of cells for 4 days in Petri dishes (in the absence or presence of Me2SO) followed by plating into tissue culture dishes on day 4. Cells were harvested for total RNA on day 9. At least three clonal populations, which behaved similarly, were isolated for each cell line.Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated onto gelatin-coated coverslips on day 4 and fixed on day 9 in –20 °C methanol. Cells were rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline and myosin heavy chain expression (MHC) was detected utilizing monoclonal MF20 antibody supernatant (40Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Google Scholar) and nuclei were detected by Hoechst stain as described previously (9Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 21Google Scholar). In brief, 40 μl of MF20 supernatant in 40 μl of phosphate-buffered saline was incubated on coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed 3× 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 80 μl of 1:100 dilution of goat anti-mouse Cy3-linked antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. After phosphate-buffered saline washes, coverslips were mounted and immunofluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Images were captured on a Sony 3CCD camera and processed utilizing Axiovision, Adobe Photoshop 7, and Canvas 8 software.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from each differentiation utilizing the LiCl method, as described (32Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Google Scholar). Twelve μg of total RNA were separated on a 1% agarose, formaldehyde gel, transferred onto Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Blots were then hybridized to DNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dNTP by multiprime labeling (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at 42 °C. Probes for Pax3, Meox1, Six1, MyoD, myogenin, and 18s (for standarization of loading) have been described previously (9Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 21Google Scholar). The Gli2 probe consisted of an EcoRI-ApaI N-terminal fragment of mouse Gli2 cDNA, provided kindly by H. Sasaki (30Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Google Scholar). Northern blots were then washed 5× 5 min in low stringency wash (2× SSC, 0.2% SDS) at 42 °C and for 15 min in high stringency wash (0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS) at 65 °C. Blots were visualized by autoradiography. Figures shown were spliced from the same autoradiogram.Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was harvested on day 9 utilizing TRIzol reagent, as per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen), or the LiCl method, followed by purification with RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Approximately 1 μg of DNase I-treated RNA was used to synthesize first strand DNA, utilizing the SuperScript First-strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Random hexamers (50 ng) were utilized as per the manufacturer's protocol. Two μl of first-strand DNA was then used for PCR. Oligonucleotides to amplify Myf-5 were 5′-GAGCTGCTGAGGGAACAGGTGGAGA and 3′-GTTCTTTCGGGACCAGACAGGGCTG at an annealing temperature of 68 °C. The oligonucleotides and PCR conditions for myogenin and tubulin have been described previously (37Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Google Scholar). First-strand reactions were tested for linearity with each set of oligonucleotides, and negative controls included RT experiments in the absence of RNA or reverse transcriptase enzyme and PCR in the absence of first strand reaction. Southern blot analysis was carried out to analyze RT-PCR products utilizing probes for myogenin and tubulin as described previously (37Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Google Scholar) and a full-length cDNA fragment of mouse Myf-5.Myogenic Conversion Assay—C3H 10T1/2 fibroblasts were grown in 10% 1:1 cosmic calf-fetal calf bovine serum in α-minimum Eagle's medium. 10T1/2 cells were transfected on gelatin-coated coverslips utilizing the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Myogenic conversion was induced by 1.4 μg of PGK-MyoD. To determine whether Gli2, Meox1, or Gli2 could induce myogenic conversion, 10T1/2 cells were transfected with 1.4–3 μg of CMV-Gli2, PGK-Meox1, or PGK-Pax3. All transfections included 0.5 μg of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for transfection efficiency. Total DNA in each transfection was brought up to 4 μg with PGK vector plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were transferred to differentiation media containing 2% horse serum. Transfection efficiency was calculated by counting green fluorescent protein-positive cells 2–3 days after transfection. Six days after transfection, cells were fixed and stained for the presence of myosin heavy chain by immunofluorescence with MF20. Myogenic conversion was quantitated by counting cells expressing myosin heavy chain, normalized to transfection efficiency.RESULTSGli2 and Meox1 Activate the Expression of Each Other in Aggregated P19 Cells—To examine the ability of Gli2 to induce skeletal myogenesis, cell lines stably expressing Gli2 (termed P19(Gli2) cells) were isolated. P19(Gli2) cells and control cells were aggregated in the absence of Me2SO. Under these conditions, control cells do not differentiate into skeletal muscle, as shown by the lack of MHC-expressing cells in these cultures on day 9 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, P19(Gli2) cells did differentiate into skeletal muscle, as shown by the presence of bipolar MHC-expressing myocytes (Fig. 1D), representing <4% of these cultures. Therefore, Gli2 can induce low levels of skeletal myogenesis in aggregated P19 cells.To identify the factors activated by Gli2 expression, total RNA was harvested on days 0 and 9 of differentiation. By Northern blot analysis, Gli2 transcript levels were high in P19(Gli2) cell lines, but not in control cell lines (Fig. 2, panel I, A). Transcription factors expressed in the dermomyotome of the developing somite, such as Pax3 and Meox1, were activated by day 9 of differentiation in P19(Gli2) cell lines but not control cell lines (Fig. 2, panel I, B and C). Interestingly, Meox1 transcripts were also present in monolayer cultures, suggesting that Gli2 can activate Meox1 expression in the absence of additional factors induced by aggregation (Fig. 2, Panel I, B). Furthermore, expression of Gli1 in aggregated P19 cells induced skeletal myogenesis as well as Meox1 and Pax3 transcript levels (data not shown), similar to the Gli2-induced skeletal muscle program. Therefore, Gli factors can induce the expression of Pax3 and Meox1, which are factors thought to be involved in the specification of mesodermal precursors to the myogenic lineage.Fig. 2Gli2 activates the expression of transcription factors that play a role in skeletal myogenesis. Panel I, P19(Gli2) and control cells were differentiated in the absence of Me2SO and total RNA was harvested on days 0 and 9 of differentiation. Northern blots containing 12 μg of total RNA from control cells (lanes 1 and 2) and P19(Gli2) cells (lanes 3–6) were probed for various factors, as indicated on the right. Panel II, RT-PCR analysis was carried out on RNA harvested from P19 control (lane 1) and P19(Gli2) cells (lanes 2 and 3) on day 9 of differentiation in the absence of Me2SO. The factors amplified are indicated on the right. Lanes are indicated at the bottom of each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether Gli2 overexpression can activate MRF expression in P19 cells, transcripts were analyzed on day 9 of differentiation in P19(Gli2) and control cell lines. MyoD and myogenin transcripts were not observed by Northern blot analysis, indicating that MRFs were not induced to high levels in P19(Gli2) cells (data not shown). By RT-PCR analysis, both Myf-5 and myogenin transcripts were detected in P19(Gli2) cell lines, confirming that commitment into the skeletal muscle lineage occurred in these cultures and not control cells (Fig. 2, panel II, E and F). Very low levels of MRF transcripts were present in the absence of muscle in the control cultures on days 0 (data not shown) and 9, in agreement with studies in other systems (41George-Weinstein M. Gerhart J. Blitz J. Simak E. Knudsen K.A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 14-24Google Scholar, 42Lin-Jones J. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 407-422Google Scholar). Although exogenous Gli2 was expressed at high levels on day 0 in P19(Gli2) cells, Myf-5 was not activated on day 0 (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that Gli2 can up-regulate the expression of the myogenic factors, and that the activation is dependent on cellular aggregation in P19 cells.In contrast to the results in P19 cells, Gli2 was not able to convert 10T1/2 fibroblasts into skeletal muscle using a myogenic conversion assay (data not shown). This is similar to findings with Pax3, which can induce myogenesis in P19 cells (9Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 21Google Scholar) as well as paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm explants (10Maroto M. Reshef R. Munsterberg A.E. Koester S. Goulding M. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 139-148Google Scholar), but not in 10T1/2 fibroblasts (10Maroto M. Reshef R. Munsterberg A.E. Koester S. Goulding M. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 139-148Google Scholar). It is likely that Gli2 function requires factors present in aggregated P19 cells but not in fibroblasts.Because Meox1 transcripts were up-regulated by Gli2 expression and during Me2SO-induced myogenesis (9Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 21Google Scholar), we examined the ability of Meox1 to induce skeletal myogenesis. Stable cell lines overexpressing Meox1, termed P19(Meox1) cells were created and aggregated in the absence of Me2SO, along with control cell lines. Cultures were examined by immunofluorescence (data not shown), Northern blot analysis, and RT-PCR (Fig. 3). Bipolar skeletal myocytes were not observed after staining with an anti-MHC antibody (data not shown). Therefore, in contrast to results with Gli2, and previous results with activated β-catenin (13Petropoulos H. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15393-15399Google Scholar) and Pax3 (9Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 21Google Scholar), Meox1 overexpression was not sufficient to induce skeletal myogenesis in aggregated P19 cells.Fig. 3Overexpression of Meox1 in P19 cells induces Gli2 expression but not Myf-5 or myogenin. P19(control) cells (panel I, lanes 2 and 3 and panel II, lanes 1 and 2) and two or three clonal populations of P19(Meox1) cells (panel I, lanes 4–7 and panel II, lanes 3–8) were differentiated in the absence of Me2SO. Total RNA was harvested on days 0 and 9. A positive P19 control (panel I, lane 1, and panel II, lane 9) was differentiated in the presence of 0.8% Me2SO and total RNA was harvested on day 9. Panel I, Northern blots with 12 μg of RNA were probed with the factors indicated on the left. Lanes are indicated at the bottom. Panel II, RT-PCR was carried out and reactions were separated on polyacrylamide gels. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the factors indicated on the left. RT-PCR controls include no reverse transcriptase (lane 10), control RNA (lane 11), no RNA (lane 12), and PCR-H2O (lane 13). Lanes are indicated at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)By Northern blot analysis, Meox1 transcripts were present at high levels in P19(Meox1) cells on day 9 and lower levels on day 0 (Fig. 3, panel I, A). This variability in PGK-driven transcript expression is because of the enhancer/silencer effects at the site of insertion and is seen in many P19 cell lines (35Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Google Scholar, 37Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gli2 transcripts were up-regulated in P19(Meox1) cells, compared with control cells, whereas Pax3 transcripts were not significantly increased over background"

Differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into type-2 helper (Th2) cells is accompanied by chromatin remodeling including hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the nucleosomes associated with the IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 genes. Histone hyperacetylation of the IL-5 gene displayed a delayed kinetics compared with that of the IL-4 and IL-13 genes, suggesting a distinct remodeling mechanism for the IL-5-gene locus. Here we studied the role of CD28 costimulation in the generation of IL-5-producing cells and the histone hyperacetylation of the IL-5 gene locus. CD28-costimulation selectively enhanced histone hyperacetylation of the IL-5 gene locus that appeared to be mediated through NF-κB activation and subsequent up-regulation of GATA3. The CD28 costimulation-sensitive histone hyperacetylation spanned almost the entire intergenic region between the IL-5 and RAD50 accompanied with intergenic transcript. Thus, this is the first demonstration that CD28 costimulation controls a chromatin-remodeling process during Th2 cell differentiation.

Coffman R.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 145-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (6863) Google Scholar). Th1 cells produce IFNγ and tumor necrosis factor-β and initiate cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and are involved in humoral immunity and allergic responses. The cytokine environment is crucial in controlling the direction of Th cell differentiation (2Seder R.A. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev.

For Th1 cell differentiation, IL-12-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 4 is required, whereas IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation is important for Th2 cell generation (4Abbas A.K.

In addition, TCR stimulation events upon encounter with antigens are also indispensable for both Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation. We reported that efficient TCR-mediated activation of the p56lck, calcineurin, and Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade is crucial for Th2 cell differentiation (7Yamashita M.

We also generated a precise map of the Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation within the IL-13 and IL-4 gene loci and identified a 71-bp conserved GATA3 response element 1.6 kilobase pairs upstream of IL-13 locus exon 1. This histone hyperacetylation remodeling process could be a major target for the Th2 master transcription factor GATA3 to induce differentiation toward Th2 cells. Histone hyperacetylation of another Th2 cytokine gene locus, IL-5, occurs in a Th2-specific STAT6- and GATA3-dependent manner with significantly different kinetics compared with that of the IL-4 and IL-13 genes (34Yamashita M.

The direction of transcription of the IL-5 gene is opposite to that of IL-13 and IL-4. In addition, the RAD50 gene encoding a DNA repair enzyme is located between the IL-5 and IL-13 gene loci. A differential role for GATA3 in the regulation of promoter activity of the IL-5 gene from IL-4 has been suggested (37Lee H.J. O'Garra A. Arai K. Arai N. J.

These results encouraged us to explore possible novel molecular mechanisms that would govern histone hyperacetylation of the IL-5 gene locus. In the present study we investigated histone hyperacetylation of the IL-5 gene locus in developing Th2 cells cultured with or without CD28 costimulation. A long range CD28-sensitive Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation was detected in the IL-5 and intergenic region of the IL-5 and RAD50 gene loci. The hyperacetylation was accompanied by CD28-sensitive intergenic transcripts and required high expression of GATA3. A molecular mechanism that governs Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation of the IL-5-gene associated nucleosomes will be discussed. Mice—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). STAT6-deficient (KO) mice were kindly provided by Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) (40Takeda K. Tanaka T. Shi W. Matsumoto M. Minami M. Kashiwamura S. Nakanishi K. Yoshida N.

For intracellular staining, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-IFN-γ antibody (XMG1.2; Pharmingen), phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-IL-4 antibody (11B11; Pharmingen), and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-IL-5 antibody (TRFK5; Pharmingen) were used. To detect intracellular IL-13, biotinylated polyclonal anti-IL-13 antibody (R&D Systems), and phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated avidin were used. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences), and results were analyzed by CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences). Cell Cultures and in Vitro T Cell Differentiation—Splenic CD4 T cells were stained with anti-CD4-fluorescein isothiocyanate and then purified using magnetic beads and an Auto-MACS sorter® (Miltenyi Biotec), yielding a purity of >98%. Enriched CD4 T cells (1.5 × 106) were stimulated for 2 days with immobilized anti-TCR mAb (H57-597, 3 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 mAb (37.51, 3 μg/ml) in the presence of IL-2 (25 units/ml), IL-12 (100 units/ml), and anti-IL-4 mAb (11B11, 25% culture supernatant) for Th1-skewed conditions. For Th2-skewed conditions, cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-TCR mAb as above but in the presence of IL-2 (25 units/ml), IL-4 (100 units/ml), and anti-IFNγ mAb (R4.6A2, 25% culture supernatant). The cells were then transferred to new dishes and cultured for another 5 days in the presence of immobilized anti-TCR mAb, soluble anti-CD28 mAb, and the cytokines present in the initial culture. To enhance the generation of IL-5-producing cells, stimulation with anti-TCR and anti-CD28 mAbs was performed during the second culture for 5 days. This procedure is slightly different from that used in our previous report (16Kubo M. Yamashita M. Abe R. Tada T. Okumura K. Ransom J.T. Nakayama T. J.

Costimulation with Anti-CD28 mAb Enhances the Generation of IL-5- and IL-13-producing Cells—The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanisms that control chromatin remodeling of the IL-5 gene locus during Th2 cell differentiation. We first assessed the role for CD28 costimulation in the generation of IL-5-producing Th2 cells. Freshly prepared CD4 T cells from young adult (4 weeks) B6 mice were cultured in vitro with immobilized anti-TCR in the presence of agonistic anti-CD28 mAbs (37.51) to effect stimulation. The IL-5/IL-4 profiles of CD4 T cells cultured under Th1- or Th2-skewed conditions are depicted in Fig. 1A. As can be seen, the generation of IL-5-producing cells (both IL-5+IL-4- and IL-5+IL-4+ fractions) cultured under Th2-skewed conditions was greatly enhanced in the presence of CD28 costimulation. The increased generation of IL-4-producing cells was marginal under these culture conditions. IL-5-producing cells generated with CD28 costimulation were STAT6-dependent and not detected under Th1-skewed culture conditions. The generation of IFNγ-producing Th1 cells was moderately increased by the presence of CD28 costimulation (Fig. 1B). The levels of IL-13-producing cells were also increased by the presence of CD28 costimulation (Fig. 1C). Concurrently, the amount of cytokines produced by developing Th2 cells cultured with CD28 costimulation was assessed by ELISA (Fig. 1, D and E). As expected, CD28 costimulation significantly enhanced the production of IL-5 and IL-13, whereas the effects on the production of IL-4 and IFNγ were marginal. The production of Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13, and IL-4) was all STAT6-dependent regardless of the presence or absence of CD28 costimulation (Fig. 1E). Taken together these results suggest that the generation of IL-5- and IL-13-producing cells was Th2-specific, STAT6-dependent, and more sensitive to CD28 costimulation as compared with that of IL-4-producing cells. Dynamics of Histone H3 Hyperacetylation of the IL-5 Gene Locus in Developing Th2 Cells Cultured with CD28 Costimulation—To clarify whether CD28 costimulation enhances histone hyperacetylation of the IL-5 gene locus during Th2 cell differentiation, we first examined the kinetics of acetylation of the IL-5 promoter, IL-4 promoter, and RAD50 promoter regions using a ChIP assay with anti-acetylhistone H3 Ab. Developing Th1 and Th2 cells cultured with CD28 costimulation were harvested 2, 3.5, 5, and 7 days after stimulation. The results of this analysis are presented as the relative band intensity of each group normalized with band intensity of the corresponding input DNA as shown in the right panel of Fig. 2. Two days after stimulation, low but significant levels of increase in acetylation occurred at all of the regions tested, and basically no difference between the three culture conditions was noted. However, as shown in Fig. 2A, the levels of histone acetylation associated with the IL-5 promoter increased significantly after cultivation for more than 3 days under Th2 skewed conditions, particularly in those cultures with CD28 costimulation. In contrast, the levels of histone hyperacetylation in the IL-4 promoter were increased day by day, and no significant difference was detected in the presence or absence of CD28 costimulation. The levels of histone hyperacetylation in the RAD50 gene promoter region were increased equivalently under these three culture conditions. These results suggest that histone hyperacetylation of the IL-5 gene locus is more sensitive to CD28 costimulation than that of the IL-4 locus. Enhanced Histone Hyperacetylation Induced with CD28 Costimulation Is Observed Only in the IL-5-associated Nucleosomes—Next, we examined the acetylation status of the DNA regions corresponding to IL-5 promoter, IL-5 intron, IL-13 intron, IL-4 promoter, CNS1, IL-4 VA enhancer, RAD50 promoter, and IFNγ promoter. CNS1 and IL-4 VA enhancer regions were previously described to contain regulatory elements or DNase I hypersensitive sites (28Loots G.G. Locksley R.M. Blankespoor C.M. Wang Z.E. Miller W. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Science. 2000; 288: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 30Agarwal S. Avni O. Rao A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Histone hyperacetylation induced in these regions, except for two controls (RAD50 and IFNγ), occurred in a Th2-specific manner as reported previously (34Yamashita M. Ukai-Tadenuma M. Kimura M. Omori M. Inami M. Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42399-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, the levels of acetylation in the region of IL-5 promoter and IL-5 intron were significantly enhanced by the presence of CD28 costimulation. In contrast, those of other regions were all unaffected. The effect of CD28 costimulation on the histone hyperacetylation within the IL-5 gene loci was analyzed more precisely with a series of primer pairs within the IL-5 genes as shown in Fig. 3B. CD28 costimulation significantly enhanced the levels of histone hyperacetylation at all regions within the IL-5 genes tested (Fig. 3C)."

Its effects on ion currents have been investigated in pituitary GH3 cells. This compound increased Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK(Ca)) in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 14 ± 2 μm. However, the magnitude of CAPE-induced stimulation of IK(Ca) was attenuated in GH3 cells preincubated with 2,2′-azo-bis-(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (100 μm) or t-butyl hydroperoxide (1 mm). CAPE (50 μm) slightly suppressed voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ current. In inside-out configuration, CAPE (20 μm) applied to the intracellular face of the detached patch enhanced the activity of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels with no modification in single-channel conductance. After BKCa channel activity was increased by CAPE (20 μm), subsequent application of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (20 μm) did not further increase the channel activity. CAPE-stimulated channel activity was dependent on membrane potential. CAPE could also increase Ca2+ sensitivity of BKCa channels in these cells. Its increase in the open probability could primarily involve a decrease in the mean closed time. In current-clamp conditions, CAPE hyperpolarized the membrane potential and reduced the firing of action potentials. The stimulatory effects on these channels may partly contribute to the underlying mechanisms through which this compound influences the functional activities of neurons or neuroendocrine cells. Caution has to be used in attributing its response in the activation of NF-κB.

Capsso R. Borrelli F. Mascolo N. Life Sci. 2003; 73: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, the effects of CAPE on ion currents have not been thoroughly studied. Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels play important roles in controlling the excitability of nerve, muscle, and other cells by stabilizing cell membrane at negative potentials (11Gribkoff V.K. Starrett Jr., J.E. Dworetzky S.I. Neuroscientist. 2001; 12: 1023-1026Google Scholar). Their gating is known to be controlled by intracellular Ca2+ and/or membrane depolarization. The challenging of cells with oxidizing agents has been found to suppress the channel activity of these channels (12Sheu S.J. Wu S.N. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Pituitary GH3 cells have been demonstrated to exhibit the activity of these channels (13Lang D.G. Ritchie A.K. J. Physiol. 1990; 425: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Riluzole and ciglitazone, both of which were reported to prevent neuronal injuries, could enhance the activity of BKCa channels functionally expressed in these cells (14Wu S.N. Li H.F. J. Investig. Med. 1999; 47: 484-495PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wu S.N. Ho L.L.T. Li H.F. Chiang H.T. J. Investig. Med. 2000; 48: 259-269PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the opener of these channels has been shown to counteract the deleterious effects of excitatory neurotransmitters following neurotoxic or ischemic injuries (16Gribkoff V.K. Starrett Jr., J.E. Dworetzky S.I. Hewawasam P. Boissard C.G. Cook D.A. Frantz S.W. Heman K. Hibbard J.R. Huston K. Johnson G. Krishnan B.S. Kinney G.G. Lombardo L.A. Meanwell N.A. Molinoff P.B. Myers R.A. Moon S.L. Ortiz A. Pajor L. Pieschl R.L. Post-Munson D.J. Signor L.J. Srinivas N. Taber M.T. Thalody G. Trojnacki J.T. Wiener H. Yeleswaram K. Yeola S.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Previous studies also revealed that the BKCa channel might be a relevant target of DNA synthesis in cultured Müller glial cells (17Kodal H. Weick M. Moll V. Biedermann B. Reichenbach A. Bringmann A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 4262-4267PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the objective of this study was to (a) address the question of whether CAPE could affect Ca2+-activated K+ currents (IK(Ca)) in GH3 cells; (b) determine the effects of this compound on the activity of BKCa channels; and (c) examine whether it can influence the membrane potential. Interestingly, the present results indicate that in GH3 lactotrophs, CAPE does not appear to affect the activation of NF-κB exclusively, despite its ability to inhibit NF-κB activation in these cells (18Grandison L. Nolan G.P. Pfaff D.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 106: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The CAPE-induced increase in BKCa channel activity may account, at least in part, for its effects on cellular functions in neurons or neuroendocrine cells. Cell Culture—The clonal strain GH3 cell line, originally derived from a rat anterior pituitary adenoma, was obtained from the Culture Collection and Research Center (CCRC-60015; Hsinchu, Taiwan). The detailed methods have been previously described (19Wu S.N. Li H.F. Chiang H.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 865-873PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum (v/v), 2.5% fetal calf serum (v/v), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) in a humidified environment of 5% CO2/95% air. The experiments were generally performed 5 or 6 days after cells were subcultured (60–80% confluence). Electrophysiological Measurements—Immediately before each experiment, the cells were dissociated, and an aliquot of cell suspension was transferred to a recording chamber positioned on the stage of an inverted microscope (DM IL; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The cells were bathed at room temperature (20–25 °C) in normal Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mm CaCl2. The recording pipettes were pulled from Kimax-51 capillaries (Kimble Glass, Vineland, NJ) using a two-stage microelectrode puller (PP-830; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan), and the tips were fire-polished with a microforge (MF-83, Narishige). When filled with pipette solution, their resistance ranged between 3 and 5 mΩ. Ion currents were measured in the cell-attached, inside-out, and whole cell configurations of the patch-clamp technique, using an RK-400 patchclamp amplifier (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) (19Wu S.N. Li H.F. Chiang H.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 865-873PubMed Google Scholar). Data Recording and Analysis—The signals were displayed on an analog/digital oscilloscope (HM 507; Hameg, East Meadow, NY) and on a liquid crystal projector (PJ550-2; ViewSonic, Walnut, CA). The data were stored in a Pentium III grade laptop computer (Slimnote VX3; Lemel, Taipei, Taiwan) at 10 kHz through a Digidata 1322A interface (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). This device was controlled by a commercially available software (pCLAMP 9.0; Axon Instruments). The currents were low pass filtered at 1 or 3 kHz. Ion currents obtained during whole cell experiments were stored without leakage correction and analyzed using the pCLAMP 9.0 software (Axon Instruments) or the Origin 6.0 software (Microcal, Northampton, MA). To calculate the percentage of stimulation of CAPE on IK(Ca), each cell was depolarized from 0 to +50 mV, and current amplitude during cell exposure to CAPE was measured and compared. The amplitude of IK(Ca) in the presence of this compound at a concentration 200 μm was taken as 100%. The concentration of CAPE required to increase 50% of current amplitude was then determined using a Hill function, y = (Emax × [C]nh)/(EC50nh +[C]nh), where [C] is the CAPE concentration, EC50 is the concentration required for a 50% increase; nh is the Hill coefficient, and Emax is the CAPE-induced maximal increase in the amplitude of IK(Ca). The amplitudes of single BKCa channel currents were determined by fitting Gaussian distributions to the amplitude histograms of the closed and the open state. The channel open probability in a patch was expressed as N·Po, which can be estimated using the following equation: N·Po = (A1 + 2A2 + 3A3 +...+ nAn)/(A0 + A1 + A2 + A3 +...+ An), where N is the number of active channels in the patch, A0 is the area under the curve of an all points histogram corresponding to the closed state, and A1....An represent the histogram areas reflecting the levels of distinct open state for 1 to n channels in the patch. The relationships between the membrane potentials and the probability of channel openings obtained before and after the application of CAPE (20 μm) were fitted with a Boltzmann function of the form: N·Po = nP/{1 + exp[– (V – V½)/k]}, where nP = the maximal open probability, V = the membrane potential in mV, V½ is the voltage at which there is half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor of the activation curve (i.e. the voltage dependence of the activation process in mV per e-fold change). The averaged results are presented as the mean values ± S.E. The paired Student's t test was used for the statistical analyses. To further clarify the statistical difference among the two or four treatment groups, analyses of variance with Duncan's multiple range test for multiple comparisons were also performed. Differences between values were considered significant when p < 0.05. Drugs and Solutions—CAPE (phenethyl caffeiate) was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Curcumin, glibenclamide, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and riluzole were obtained from Sigma/RBI (Natick, MA), and t-butyl hydroperoxide, dithiothreitol, and tetraethylammonium chloride from Sigma. 2,2′-Azo-bis(2-aminopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) was purchased from Wako Pure Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), paxilline from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and cilostazol from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Bristol, UK). Tetrodotoxin and apamin were obtained from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel), and fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester and fura-2 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Squamocin was a gift from Dr. Yang-Chang Wu (Graduate Institute of Natural Products, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan). The composition of normal Tyrode's solution was 136.5 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.53 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 5.5 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4. To record the K+ currents or membrane potential, the recording pipette was backfilled with a solution consisting of 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm Na2ATP, 0.1 mm Na2GTP, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.2. The free Ca2+ concentration of this solution was estimated to be 230 nm, assuming that the residual contaminating Ca2+ concentration was 70 μm, and the ratiometric fura-2 measurement with F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) showed that this solution contained 205 ± 12 nm free Ca2+ for three different experiments. To measure voltage-dependent Ca2+ current, KCl inside the pipette solution was replaced with equimolar CsCl, and pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH, whereas bathing solution contained 1 μm tetrodotoxin and 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride. For single-channel current recordings, the high K+ bathing solution contained 145 mm KCl, 0.53 MgCl2 and 5 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.4, and the pipette solution contained 145 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.2. The value of free Ca2+ concentration was calculated assuming a dissociation constant for EGTA and Ca2+ (at pH 7.2) of 0.1 μm. To provide 0.1 μm free Ca2+ in bath solution, 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm EGTA were added. Effect of CAPE on Ca2+-activated K+Current (IK(Ca)) in GH3 Cells—In the first series of experiments, the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to investigate the effect of CAPE on ion currents in these cells. The cells were bathed in normal Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mm CaCl2, and the pipette solution contained 0.1 mm EGTA and 3 mm ATP. ATP (3 mm) included in the pipette solution was effective at suppressing ATP-sensitive K+ channels (20Wu S.N. Li H.F. Chiang H.T. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 178: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To inactivate other types of voltage-dependent K+ currents, each cell was held at the level of 0 mV. As illustrated in Fig. 1, when the cell was held at 0 mV and different potentials ranging from –10 to +60 mV with 10-mV increments were applied, a family of large, noisy, outward currents was elicited. These outward currents have been previously identified as IK(Ca) (19Wu S.N. Li H.F. Chiang H.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 865-873PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, within 1 min of exposing the cells to CAPE (20 μm), the amplitude of outward currents was greatly increased throughout the entire range of voltage-clamp step. For example, when the cells were depolarized from 0 to +50 mV, current amplitudes measured at the end of the depolarizing pulses were increased to 552 ± 36 pA from a control of 228 ± 25 pA (p < 0.05; n = 8). This stimulatory effect was readily reversed after the removal of CAPE (Fig. 1). Fig. 1B illustrates the averaged I-V relationships for IK(Ca) in control, during cell exposure to CAPE (20 μm) and washout of the compound. The relationship between the CAPE concentration and the percentage increase of IK(Ca) has been constructed (Fig. 1C). This compound could increase the amplitude of IK(Ca) in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 14 ± 2 μm. At a concentration of 200 μm, it fully increased IK(Ca). The Hill coefficient was found to be 1.8, suggesting that there was a positive cooperation for its stimulation of IK(Ca). These results indicate that CAPE can produce a stimulatory action on IK(Ca) in these cells. Effect of CAPE on Voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+Current (ICa,L) in GH3 Cells—IK(Ca) can be functionally coupled with Ca2+ influx through plasmalemmal voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (21Wu S.N. Lo Y.K. Li H.F. Shen A.Y. Chin. J. Physiol. 2001; 44: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report also demonstrated that the action of CAPE on vasorelaxation in rat thoracic aorta could be due to the blockade of Ca2+ movement through the cell membrane (10Cicala C. Morello S. Iorio C. Capsso R. Borrelli F. Mascolo N. Life Sci. 2003; 73: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we further investigated whether it could exert any effect on ICa,L that was previously described in these cells (21Wu S.N. Lo Y.K. Li H.F. Shen A.Y. Chin. J. Physiol. 2001; 44: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lo Y.K. Wu S.N. Lee C.T. Li H.F. Chiang H.T. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These experiments were conducted with a Cs+-containing solution. The exposure to CAPE (20 μm) was found to be have little or no effect on ICa,L. However, this compound at a concentration of 50 μm slightly suppressed ICa,L, although it did not modify the I-V relationship of ICa,L (Fig. 2). For example, CAPE (50 μm) decreased the amplitude of ICa,L to 42 ± 3 pA from a control value of 51 ± 6 pA (p < 0.05; n = 7), when cells were depolarized from –50 to 0 mV. Therefore, this compound stimulated IK(Ca) in a manner conceivably unlikely to be linked to an increase in the amplitude of ICa,L. Effect of CAPE on IK(Ca) in Cells Preincubated with 2,2′-Azobis(2-aminopropane) Dihydrochloride AAPH or t-Butyl Hydroperoxide—CAPE is known to be an antioxidant flavonoid (1Grunberger D. Banerjee R. Eisinger K. Oltz E.M. Efros L. Caldwell M. Estevez V. Nakanishi K. Experientia. 1988; 44: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 23Bhimani R.S. Troll W. Grunberger D. Frenkel K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4528-4533PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next evaluated whether changes in reactive oxygen species can influence CAPE-induced stimulation of IK(Ca) in GH3 cells. Interestingly, the results showed that CAPE-stimulated IK(Ca) was attenuated in GH3 cells preincubated with either 100 μm AAPH or 1 mmt-butyl hydroperoxide (Fig. 3). t-Butyl hydroperoxide is an oxidative agent, whereas AAPH is known to be an azo compound that can generate free radicals (24Massaeli H. Sobpattee S. Pierce G.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1524-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A subsequent application of dithiothreitol (10 μm) increased IK(Ca) in cells treated with AAPH or t-butyl hydroperoxide. When the AAPH-treated cells were depolarized from 0 to +50 mV, CAPE (200 μm) increased the density of IK(Ca) by about 15%. Conversely, in control cells, CAPE (200 μm) nearly fully increased the density of these currents. These results suggest that the stimulation of IK(Ca) caused by this compound can be modified in the presence of these oxidizing agents. Effect of CAPE on the Activity of BKCa Channels in GH3 Cells—The results from our whole cell experiments suggest that IK(Ca) may be K+ flux through the BKCa channel (13Lang D.G. Ritchie A.K. J. Physiol. 1990; 425: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Wu S.N. Li H.F. Chiang H.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 865-873PubMed Google Scholar), because CAPE-induced increase in IK(Ca) was suppressed by paxilline yet not by glibenclamide or apamin. To elucidate how it could act to affect IK(Ca), the effect of this compound on BKCa channels was further investigated. In these experiments, the single-channel recordings with inside-out configuration were performed in symmetrical K+ concentration (145 mm). The bath solution contained 0.1 μm Ca2+, and the potential was held at +60 mV. As shown in Fig. 4, the activity of BKCa channels could be readily observed in an excised patch. An increase in channel activity could also be obtained in cell-attached patches when cells were exposed to ionomycin (10 μm) or squamocin (10 μm). These two agents were previously reported to be Ca2+ ionophores (25Wu S.N. Chiang H.T. Chang F.R. Liaw C.C. Wu Y.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When CAPE (20 μm) was applied to the intracellular face of the detached patch, the channel open probability was increased (Fig. 4). The open probability obtained at the level of +60 mV in the control was 0.112 ± 0.005 (n = 6). The application of CAPE (20 μm) significantly increased channel activity to 0.289 ± 0.035 (p < 0.05; n = 6). When this compound was washed out, the open probability returned to the control level. However, the single-channel amplitude remained unaltered in the presence of 20 μm CAPE (Fig. 4C). Moreover, curcumin (20 μm) applied to the intracellular face of the excised patch was not found to have any effects on the probability of channel openings, whereas cilostazol (20 μm) could increase the channel activity effectively. Similar to CAPE, curcumin has been shown to inhibit the activation of NF-κB (26Leu T.H. Maa M.C. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Canc. Agents. 2002; 2: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cilostazol has been recently found to stimulate IK(Ca) in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells (27Hong K.W. Kim K.Y. Shin H.K. Lee J.H. Choi J.M. Kwak Y.G. Kim C.D. Lee W.S. Rhim B.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 1182-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Effect of Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid on BKCa Channels in GH3 Cells—Nordihydroguaiaretic acid was previously reported to stimulate BKCa channels (28Yamamura H. Nagano N. Hirano M. Muraki K. Watanabe M. Imaizumi Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 140-146PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined whether the stimulatory effects of CAPE and nordihydroguaiaretic acid on these channels are additive. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (20 μm) increased the channel open probability; however, a subsequent application of CAPE (20 μm) did not increase the channel activity further. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (20 μm) significantly increased the open probability from 0.106 ± 0.006 to 0.286 ± 0.034 (p < 0.05; n = 6). There was no significant difference in the channel activity between the presence of nordihydroguaiaretic acid alone and CAPE plus nordihydroguaiaretic acid (0.286 ± 0.034 (n = 6) versus 0.284 ± 0.032 (n = 6), p > 0.05). Conversely, the addition of riluzole (20 μm) could increase the open probability further in the continued presence of CAPE or nordihdroguaiaretic acid. Riluzole was reported to be an opener of BKCa channels (14Wu S.N. Li H.F. J. Investig. Med. 1999; 47: 484-495PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the results indicate that the stimulatory effects of CAPE and nordihydroguaiaretic acid on a single BKCa channel are not additive in GH3 cells. Lack of Effect of CAPE on Single-channel Conductance of BKCa Channels—In the next series of experiments, the effect of CAPE on BKCa single-channel conductance was investigated. In inside-out configuration, the cells were bathed in symmetrical K+ concentration (145 mm), and the bath solution contained 0.1 μm Ca2+. Fig. 5 (C and D) illustrates the I-V relationships of BKCa channels obtained in the absence and presence of CAPE (20 μm). The single BKCa channel conductance calculated from a linear I-V relationship in control was 196 ± 12 pS (n = 11) with a reversal potential of 0 ± 3mV(n = 11). Notably, the value of single-channel conductance did not differ from that (197 ± 11 pS; p > 0.05, n = 10) obtained in the presence of CAPE (20 μm). These results indicate that CAPE causes no modification in single-channel conductance, despite its ability to increase the channel open probability. Effect of CAPE on the Activation Curve of BKCa Channels—Fig. 5E shows the activation curve of BKCa channels in the absence and presence of CAPE (20 μm). The plot of open probability of BKCa channels as a function of membrane potential was fitted with a Boltzmann function as described under “Materials and Methods.” In control, nP = 0.35 ± 0.04, V½ = 75.4 ± 1.6 mV, and k = 10.7 ± 0.4 mV (n = 6), whereas in the presence of CAPE (20 μm), nP = 0.71 ± 0.07, V½ = 61.2 ± 1.9 mV, and k = 10.9 ± 0.6 mV (n = 6). The data showed that the activation curve was shifted along the voltage axis to less positive potentials in the presence of CAPE. In contrast, no significant change in the slope (i.e. k value) of the activation curve was detected in the presence of this compound. Taken together, these results indicate that CAPE applied to the intracellular surface of the channel is capable of increasing the open probability in a voltage-dependent fashion. Effect of Internal Ca2+Concentration on CAPE-stimulated BKCa Channel Activity in GH3 Cells—Whether the CAPE-induced increase in the activity of these channels is associated with internal Ca2+ concentration was also studied. In these experiments, when an excised membrane patch was formed, various concentrations of Ca2+ in the bath before and during exposure to CAPE (20 μm) were applied. As shown in Fig. 5F, the stimulatory effect of CAPE on BKCa channel activity was affected by changes in the level of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. For example, at the holding potential of +60 mV, the presence of CAPE (20 μm) caused a 2-fold increase in the open probability at internal Ca2+ concentration of 0.1 μm. However, at an internal Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm, CAPE at the same concentration stimulated channel activity by 4-fold. Effect of CAPE on Kinetic Behavior of BKCa Channels in GH3 Cells—The effect of CAPE on mean open and closed time of BKCa channels was examined and analyzed during recordings from patches showing only single-channel openings. As shown in Fig. 6, in control cells, the closed time histogram of BKCa channels at +60 mV can be fitted by a two-exponential curve with a mean closed time of 13.2 ± 2.8 and 55.8 ± 9.8 ms (n = 6). CAPE (20 μm) decreased the lifetime of the closed state to 10.9 ± 2.2 ms (n = 6). However, little or no change in mean open time was seen in the presence of CAPE (20 μm). Thus, the data demonstrate that its effect on BKCa channel activity in GH3 cells is primarily due to a decrease in closed time. Effect of CAPE on Spontaneous Action Potentials of GH3 Cells—The effect of CAPE on the repetitive firing of action potentials was further examined. In these experiments, the cells were bathed in normal Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mm CaCl2, and current-clamp configuration was performed with a K+-containing pipette solution. When the cells were exposed to CAPE (20 μm), the membrane became hyperpolarized, and the repetitive firing of action potentials was gradually reduced (Fig. 7, A and B). CAPE (20 μm) decreased the firing frequency from 1.05 ± 0.08 to 0.36 ± 0.05 Hz (p < 0.05; n = 6). Paxilline (1 μm), a known blocker of BKCa channels, reversed the CAPE-induced decrease of firing frequency to 0.86 ± 0.07 Hz (p < 0.05; n = 5). Thus, it is clear that this compound can regulate the firing of action potentials in these cells. Effect of CAPE on IK(Ca) That Is Active in Normal Action Potential Waveforms—To determine whether CAPE affects IK(Ca) that is active during normal action potentials, each cell was held at –50 mV, and the ramp hyperpolarization pulses from +20 to –50 mV with a duration of 100 ms at a rate of 0.05 Hz were delivered to mimic action potential-like waveforms of GH3 cells (22Lo Y.K. Wu S.N. Lee C.T. Li H.F. Chiang H.T. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 (C and D), when cells were bathed in normal Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mm CaCl2, the current traces representing the I-V relationships of IK(Ca) were observed in response to a voltage ramp protocol ranging from +20 to –50 mV. The application of CAPE (20 μm) increased peak outward currents from 203 ± 15 to 506 ± 34 pA (p < 0.05; n = 6). A subsequent application of paxilline (1 μm) could decrease the CAPE-stimulated IK(Ca) from 506 ± 34 to 312 ± 26 pA (p < 0.05; n = 6). Thus, consistent with its inhibition of spontaneous action potentials, the results indicate that CAPE can increase IK(Ca) that is active during normal action potentials. This study shows that CAPE (a) increases the amplitude of IK(Ca) in a concentration-dependent manner in pituitary GH3 cells, (b) enhances the activity of BKCa channel in a voltage-dependent manner, and (c) reduces the repetitive firing of action potentials. This compound increased the probability of these channels in a mechanism unlikely to be linked to its inhibition of activation of NF-κB. The stimulation by CAPE of IK(Ca) conceivably could be one of the mechanisms underlying CAPE-induced actions, if similar results occur in neurons or neuroendocrine cells in vivo. The EC50 value of CAPE required for the stimulation of IK(Ca) was 14 μm in this study. This value is similar to that required for the inhibition of NF-κB activation (2Natarajan K. Singh S. Burke Jr., T.R. Grunberger D. Aggarwal B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9090-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Therefore, there might be a link between the actions of CAPE on neurons or neuroendocrine cells and its observed effects on ion channels, although further experiments are required to find out whether CAPE can interact with the BKCa channel to influence IK(Ca) in other types of cells. However, a lack of effect of glibenclamide excludes the involvement of activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channel in CAPE-stimulated IK(Ca) in these cells. A previous study showed that activation of NF-κB could be accompanied by a decrease in the current density of smooth muscle L-type Ca2+ channel (29Kinoshita K. Sato K. Hori M. Ozaki H. Karaki H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G483-G493PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present results indicate that the CAPE-induced increase in IK(Ca) does not depend on the increased availability of intracellular Ca2+ resulting from the enhanced Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, because it was not found to increase the amplitude of ICa,L. These observations are compatible with a recent report showing the inability of CAPE to alter the decrease in intracellular Ca2+ induced by low K+ solution in cerebellar granule cells (30Amodio R. De Ruvo C. Di Matteo V. Poggi A. Di Santo A. Martelli N. Lorenzet R. Rotilio D. Cacchio M. Esposito E. Int. J. Dev. Neuroscience. 2003; 21: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrating that this compound at a concentration of 50 μm produced a slight reduction in the amplitude of ICa,L can also account for its ability to inhibit high K+-induced vasoconstriction in isolated rat aorta (10Cicala C. Morello S. Iorio C. Capsso R. Borrelli F. Mascolo N. Life Sci. 2003; 73: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that dithiothreitol could stimulate IK(Ca) in GH3 cells (31Huang M.H. Wu S.N. Chen C.P. Shen A.Y. Life Sci. 2002; 70: 1185-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In AAPH-treated cells, the stimulatory effect of CAPE on IK(Ca) was attenuated, and a subsequent application of dithiothreitol effectively increased the amplitude of IK(Ca). These results suggest that the sulfhydryl oxidizing and reducing agents can produce an effect on IK(Ca) in GH3 cells. It will be interesting to determine to what extent the decreased production of reactive oxygen species caused by CAPE affects the stimulatory effect of CAPE on IK(Ca), because this compound is known to be a potent flavonoid antioxidant (1Grunberger D. Banerjee R. Eisinger K. Oltz E.M. Efros L. Caldwell M. Estevez V. Nakanishi K. Experientia. 1988; 44: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 23Bhimani R.S. Troll W. Grunberger D. Frenkel K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4528-4533PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it seems likely that a decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species caused by CAPE is upstream of its stimulation of IK(Ca). Direct activation of BKCa channels and indirect inhibition of production of reactive oxygen species may synergistically contribute to the underlying cellular mechanisms through which this compound modifies the repetitive firing of these cells. In addition, like NS004 (32Dworetzky S.I. Trojnacki J.T. Gribkoff V.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), CAPE was found to increase Ca2+ sensitivity of BKCa channels observed in GH3 cells. Its ability to increase Ca2+ sensitivity of BKCa channels suggests that the CAPE molecule may modify the cysteine residues near the carboxyl-terminal, Ca2+ bowl domain of these channels (33Tang X.D. Garcia M.L. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrated that CAPE could not modify single-channel conductance of BKCa channels, but it did increase the channel open probability. The increase in the amplitude of IK(Ca) caused by CAPE is primarily thought to be a result of a decrease in mean closed time. It was also seen that CAPE shifted the activation curve of BKCa channels to the left with no modification in the slope factor of this curve. This compound thus appears to produce the stimulation of BKCa channels by a direct effect on the channel or closely associated site, although the precise mechanisms of its action remain to be further elucidated. However, our data demonstrated that CAPE applied to the intracellular face of the excised patch produced a fraction of channel closings to shift to short-lived closings, resulting in one closed kinetic state. It is worth mentioning that unlike the molecules of NS004, NS1619, or riluzole, the CAPE molecule has the juxtaposition of two aromatic rings, the unique structure of which is similar to those of some BKCa channel openers, such as nordihydroguaiaretic acid and resveratrol (Fig. 8) (34Wu S.N. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrated that the stimulatory effect of CAPE and nordihydroguaiaretic acid on the BKCa channel was not additive. It is thus tempting to speculate that these two compounds, which are structurally related, may interact with the same binding site in the channel. CAPE has been recently reported to induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol in C6 glioma cells (35Lee Y.J. Kuo H.C. Chu C.Y. Wang C.J. Lin W.C. Tseng T.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2281-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c was found to activate K+ channels (36Platoshyn O. Zhang S. McDaniel S.S. Yuan J.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1298-C1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, in inside-out configurations, we showed that CAPE applied to the intracellular face of the excised patches enhanced BKCa channel activity. It is unlikely that the ability of CAPE to increase the amplitude of IK(Ca) is primarily due to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Curcumin, another inhibitor of NF-κB activation, was not found to have effects on BKCa channels, when it was applied to intracellular face of the excised patch. The results lead us to suggest that CAPE could induce the change in the activity of BKCa channels in GH3 cells in a mechanism unlikely to be linked to its inhibition of NF-κB activation. However, its change in membrane potential can be explained by the stimulatory effect on these channels. Such an effect may be responsible for its actions on neurons or neuroendocrine cells in vivo, despite the ability of this compound to inhibit activation of NF-κB in GH3 cells (18Grandison L. Nolan G.P. Pfaff D.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 106: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CAPE and other structurally related compounds seem to be intriguing pharmacological tools used to characterize the properties of the BKCa channels. Elucidation of the structure of the binding site for CAPE or other structurally related compounds might provide a structural basis for the pharmacological modulation of BKCa channels."
https://openalex.org/W2013226936,"The mammalian peroxidases, including myeloperoxidase and lactoperoxidase, bind their prosthetic heme covalently through ester bonds to two of the heme methyl groups. These bonds are autocatalytically formed. No other peroxidase is known to form such bonds. To determine whether features other than an appropriately placed carboxylic acid residue are important for covalent heme binding, we have introduced aspartate and/or glutamic acid residues into horseradish peroxidase, a plant enzyme that exhibits essentially no sequence identity with the mammalian peroxidases. Based on superposition of the horseradish peroxidase and myeloperoxidase structures, the mutated residues were Leu37, Phe41, Gly69, and Ser73. The F41E mutant was isolated with no covalently bound heme, but the heme was completely covalently bound upon incubation with H2O2. As predicted, the modified heme released from the protein was 3-hydroxymethylheme. The S73E mutant did not covalently bind its heme but oxidized it to the 8-hydroxymethyl derivative. The hydroxyl group in this modified heme derived from the medium. The other mutations gave unstable proteins. The rate of compound I formation for the F41E mutant was 100 times faster after covalent bond formation, but the reduction of compound I to compound II was similar with and without the covalent bond.

IntroductionMammalian peroxidases share a unique feature, the formation of two or three covalent bonds to their prosthetic heme 1The abbreviations used are: heme, iron protoporphyrin IX regardless of the iron oxidation and ligation state; 1-hydroxymethyl, iron 1-hydroxymethylprotoporphytin IX; iron 5-hydroxymethyl, 1-hydroxymethylprotoporphytin IX; 1,5-dihydroxy heme, iron 1,5-dihydroxymethyl-protoporphyrin IX; ABTS, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid); AU, absorbance unit(s); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; LC, liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; LPO, lactoperoxidase; MPO, myeloperoxidase; RZ, Reinheitzahl; bis-tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane; amu, atomic mass unit(s). group, not found in the peroxidases of other organisms. The two common bonds in all mammalian peroxidases are ester links between a conserved glutamate and aspartate and the heme 1-methyl and 5-methyl substituents, respectively. In MPO a third bond is forged between a methionine and the β carbon of the 2-vinyl substituent (1Fiedler T.J. Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11964-11971Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies with LPO have demonstrated that at least one of the two ester bonds is required for catalytic activity (2Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Google Scholar). Interestingly, a single covalent link between the heme and protein is also found in most members of the CYP4A, -4B, and -4F classes of cytochrome P450 enzymes (3Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11339-11346Google Scholar, 4Henne K.R. Kunze K.L. Zheng Y.M. Christmas P. Soberman R.J. Rettie A.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12925-12931Google Scholar, 5Lebrun L.A. Xu F. Kroetz D.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5931-5937Google Scholar, 6Zheng Y.M. Baer B.R. Kneller M.B. Henne K.R. Kunze K.L. Rettie A.E.

In contrast to LPO, however, mutagenesis studies show that the heme-protein covalent bond is not essential for the catalytic activity of at least some of these P450 enzymes (8Lebrun L.A. Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12755-12761Google Scholar, 6Zheng Y.M. Baer B.R. Kneller M.B. Henne K.R. Kunze K.L. Rettie A.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4601-4606Google Scholar). A long known example of heme covalent binding is provided by cytochrome c, in which a cysteine residue is covalently bound to each of the two porphyrin vinyl groups. Although many hypotheses have been formulated concerning the functional advantages of the links in cytochrome c, including bending of the heme, increasing the heme affinity (9Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Structure. 1999; 7: R281-R290Google Scholar), and increasing the stability of the methionyl-Fe(II) coordination (10Cowley A.B. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R. Benson D.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1656-1666Google Scholar), the question has yet to be definitively answered.Despite mutagenesis studies of MPO and LPO (for a review, see Ref. 11Colas C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2305-2332Google Scholar), both the mechanism by which the heme covalent bonds are formed in the mammalian peroxidases and their functional advantage remain unclear. One reason for the slow progress in this area is the relative complexity and relatively low yield of the expression systems required to obtain recombinant mammalian peroxidases, as well as the sensitivity and intransigence of these peroxidases to mutations. In addition, the expression systems only yield partially or completely processed enzymes. It has therefore not been possible to study the bond-forming reaction commencing with an enzyme from which the bond is largely absent. Nevertheless, it has been unambiguously demonstrated that the ester covalent links are formed via an autocatalytic mechanism (12DePillis G.D. Ozaki S. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Google Scholar). It has also been shown in MPO that only a carboxylate can trigger covalent tethering of the heme to the protein (13Kooter I.M. Pierik A.J. Merkx M. Averill B.A. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Wever R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11452-11453Google Scholar), and in LPO that the length of the carboxylate side chain is critical for the same bond to be formed (2Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Google Scholar).It is not known, however, whether there are requirements other than the presence of an appropriate carboxyl side chain for ester bond formation. Despite their common function and the presence of some structural homologies, mammalian peroxidases share very little sequence identity with peroxidases from other organisms (14Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar, 15Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999: 58-91Google Scholar). Is the uniqueness of covalent heme attachment in the mammalian peroxidases simply a result of the presence of appropriately positioned active site carboxylic side chains, for which there is no counterpart in other peroxidases, or is the participation of other residues required? To address this question, we have introduced a carboxylate into the active site of HRP, one of the best studied peroxidases and one that does not have such a group. This monomeric 44-kDa protein is obtained in good expression yields (16Newmyer S.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19430-19438Google Scholar, 17Savenkova M.I. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10828-10836Google Scholar), is quite stable, and shares virtually no sequence identity with MPO. Furthermore, its crystal structure has been determined (18Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Poulos T.L. Nature. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Google Scholar), making it possible to rationally select sites for introduction of the carboxylic acid side chain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Hemin, H2O2, ABTS, guaiacol, Pronase, bis-tris propane, trifluoroacetic acid, and tissue culture grade water were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals, including buffer components and HPLC solvents, were from Fisher Scientific. Native HRP was purchased from Roche. The monohydroxylated hemin derivatives used as HPLC standards were isolated from recombinant HRP (19Ator M.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1542-1551Google Scholar) and LPO (2Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Google Scholar) according to the published procedures. H 182O (95% 18O) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). High-Five™ cells were grown in supplemented Express Five SFM™ medium, both purchased from Invitrogen. The Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Excell 420™ medium purchased from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). Penicillin/streptomycin and Fungizone were purchased from the UCSF Cell Culture Facility. UV-visible absorption measurements were undertaken on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array detector. Analytical and preparative HPLC separations were performed on a Hewlett Packard 1090 or 1090-II apparatus equipped with a diode array detector using a Vydac protein-C4 5-μm 150 × 46-mm column or a MetaChem Kromasil C4 5-μm 100 × 46-mm column, both fitted with the appropriate guard column. LC/MS analyses were carried out either on a Perseptive Biosystems Mariner Biospectrometry work station coupled to an Applied Biosystems HPLC apparatus (solvent delivery system 1408, programmable absorption detector 785A) and connected to a 10-cm Applied Biosystems Aquabore C18 7-μm 100 × 1-mm column, or a Waters Micromass ZQ coupled to a Waters Alliance HPLC system (separation module 2695, dual wavelength absorbance detector 2487) connected to an Xterra C18 3.5-μm 21 × 50-mm column. Stopped flow kinetic measurements were made on a HighTech™ device, equipped with an SF-61 DX2 double mixing apparatus, a CU-61 central unit, a xenon lamp powered by a PS-678 power supply, a M300 monochromator, and an SSU-60 control unit. The mixing chambers and the syringes were thermostated at 25 °C, and the data were analyzed with Kaleidagraph 3.5. Modeling was carried out with Swiss-PDB Viewer 3.7.Cloning and Expression—The sequence GGA TCC CGG GCC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAT, encoding a BamHI site and Arg-Ala-(His)6, was added directly to the 5′ end of the HRP gene, thus modifying the previously employed construct (17Savenkova M.I. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10828-10836Google Scholar), and the sequence TAA TAA GGA TCC was added at its 3′ end. The resulting construct was subcloned into the BamHI site of pUC19. 35-mer primers were designed for the mutagenesis with the nucleotide substitutions in the center of the sequences; only the regions with changed codons are shown (actual substitutions underlined, numbering starting at the ATG codon of HRP): L37D, 105TCG ATCGAC, introducing a silent PvuI site; L37E, 105TCG ATCGAA, introducing a silent PvuI site; F41E, 120CAC GAG CAT; G69E, 204TTC GAG AAC; S73E, 216AAC GAG GCC. Mutagenesis was undertaken with the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After transformation in XL-1 Blue™, DNA was isolated from positive clones with the Promega Wizard Plus SV Miniprep™ kit, and the mutated genes isolated from their pUC19 plasmids through a BamHI digestion and purified from agarose gels with the QiaEX II™ kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Ligation was accomplished at 4 °C into a pAcGP67B plasmid (Pharmingen, BD Biosciences) preliminarily digested by BamHI, dephosphorylated, and purified with the Promega Wizard DNA clean-up™ kit. The plasmids were transformed into DH5α™, and their sequences were verified. Medium sized cultures allowed for the isolation of larger amounts of endotoxin free plasmids though the use of the Purefection™ purification kit (Promega) following the instructions from the manufacturer. Transfection in Sf9 cells was done with the Baculogold transfection kit (Pharmingen, BD Biosciences). A plaque assay on the transfection supernatants allowed for the isolation of recombinant virus that was subsequently amplified to a titer of ∼1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml using standard baculovirus protocols (20O'Reilly D.R. Miller K.l. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 124-138Google Scholar).Expression and Purification—High-Five™ cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml were supplemented with hemin (final concentration 6 μm), 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 1× Fungizone before being infected at a multiplicity of infection of ∼5. At 3.5 days after infection, the cultures were harvested and centrifuged at 4 °C and 10,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was then filtered successively through 1.2-, 0.64-, and 0.44-μm regenerated cellulose filters to remove remaining cell debris. The clarified liquid was then concentrated ∼12-fold by ultrafiltration over a spiral-wound regenerated cellulose membrane (molecular mass cut-off = 10 kDa, Millipore) connected to an Amicon TCF10 peristaltic pump equipped with a 2l RA2000S reservoir. The resulting solution was then made 0.4 m with solid NaCl and 20 mm with KH2PO4/K2HPO4 at pH = 8, and ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C and 100,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+ column (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH = 8, containing 0.4 m NaCl; the resin was then washed with ∼10 volumes, then with ∼5 volumes of the same buffer containing imidazole (20 mm imidazole for the wild type, and 5 mm for the mutants). Elution was achieved by increasing the imidazole concentration to 200 mm for the wild type and 100 mm for the mutants and switching to pH = 6. The colored fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH = 8, buffer for at least 14 h with at least three bath changes. The dialyzed fractions were then concentrated ∼12-fold by ultrafiltration over an Amicon YM10 membrane, and passed through a pre-equilibrated QFF-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column. The colored fractions were concentrated again over an Amicon Ultra-4™ centrifugal filter device (10 kDa) to 1–2 ml.Spectrophotometric Measurements—ABTS oxidation was measured in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH = 4.5, in the presence of 250 μm H2O2 and 250 μm ABTS, both from freshly prepared solutions. Absorbance changes were monitored at 414 nm and specific activities were calculated using ϵ = 38,000 cm m–1 liter–1 for the oxidized ABTS product. For the oxidation of guaiacol, activities were measured in 50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH = 7, in the presence of 600 μm H2O2 and concentrations of guaiacol up to 20 mm. The absorption at 470 nm, ϵ = 26,600 cm m–1 liter–1, was used to calculate guaiacol product formation. The concentration of H2O2 in the stock solution was assessed by measuring the absorption at 240 nm (ϵ = 39.4 cm m–1 liter–1) (21Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Google Scholar). Enzymes were diluted to the appropriate concentration in bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) when necessary. UV-visible spectra were recorded at 21 °Cin50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH = 7, and the RZ calculated as ASoret/A278 nm.H2O2 Treatment—To the enzymes (10 μm) in 50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH = 6.7, was added H2O2 (6 mm) in 2 equivalent portions every 5 min. The solutions were further incubated for another 10 min before being subjected to analysis.HPLC Analysis—Separations were achieved using water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For the analysis of undigested samples, the Vydac column was eluted with a 3-min isocratic wash of 33% solvent B, followed by a 0.5%/min linear gradient to 95% of B. For isolation of the 3-monohydroxyheme derivative, the Vydac column was eluted with a 3-min isocratic wash of 15% solvent B, followed by a 0.9%/min linear gradient to 43% of B (see above). For analysis of the 8-monohydroxyheme derivative, the Kromasil column was eluted with a 3-min isocratic wash of 15% solvent B, followed by a 0.9%/min linear gradient to 43% of B.Characterization of the F41E Mutant Porphyrin—The F41E mutant was treated with 6 × 2 equivalents of H2O2 in 100 mm bis-tris propane buffer, pH = 8.2, over a period of 35 min. Disodium EDTA, pH = 8, was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the resulting mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature before being transferred to a siliconized glass vessel (2Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Google Scholar). A freshly made 2.5 mg/ml solution of Pronase was then added, and the digestion was allowed to proceed for 36 h at 37 °C. The digest was then injected into an HPLC using the same eluant (water/acetonitrile with trifluoroacetic acid) as above with the following gradient: 0–3 min at 15% acetonitrile, and then a linear gradient of 1%/min. The porphyrin peaks were repeatedly collected in a siliconized glass tube and concentrated under a stream of N2 with gentle heating. Mass spectrometric analyses were undertaken on the Mariner instrument with the following settings: positive ion mode, spray potential 2500 V, nozzle potential 125 V and 20 scans/min, inlet flow rate 5 μl/min.Characterization of the S73E Mutant Porphyrin—The S73E mutant was treated with 7 × 2 equivalents of H2O2 as described above. The sample was made up to 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and 33% acetonitrile before being subjected to HPLC separation. The peak eluting at 6.4 min in each HPLC run was collected in a siliconized glass tube and concentrated under a stream of N2 with gentle heating. LC/MS analysis was undertaken with a Waters Alliance chromatographic system coupled with a ZQ mass analyzer. The solvents used were water and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid; a linear gradient of 2.5%/min starting at 30% of methanol was started after a 2-min wash. The settings of the mass spectrometer were as follows: capillary voltage, 3500 V; cone voltage, 30 V; desolvation temperature, 350 °C; source temperature, 120 °C.Labeling with H 182O—A 10 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH = 7, buffer in H 182O (95% 18O) was prepared by diluting the concentrated buffer (in H 182O water) 100-fold with H 182O. An S73E mutant sample was concentrated 10-fold over a Millipore Ultrafree centrifugal filter device (Biomax, 10 kDa) and rediluted 10 times with the phosphate buffer in H 182O. The solution was allowed to stand overnight at 4 °C. Three new cycles of concentration/dilution as described above were then undertaken, and the resulting solution was treated with 6 × 2 equivalents of H2O2 as previously described. After reaction, the solution was concentrated again 10-fold and re-diluted 2-fold in water/methanol (9/1). Two volumes of 100 mm disodium EDTA, pH = 8, were then added, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 5 min. An identical volume of 4:6 (v/v) water/methanol was finally added, resulting in the formation of a dense precipitate. The supernatant was harvested after centrifugation, diluted with one volume of 0.5% formic acid in water, and directly analyzed by LC/MS. This procedure is required to allow a thorough denaturation of HRP that the methanol used in the LC/MS does not achieve. The solvents, gradient, and MS settings used were the same as described in the previous paragraph.Pre-steady State Kinetic Measurements—The experiments were done at 25 °C in 50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH = 6.7. All the H2O2 and guaiacol solutions were made daily and kept on ice until used. The integration time was set at 2 ms in the diode array detector mode. For all measurements, at least five different concentrations were used and each measurement was undertaken at least twice. For the measurement of compound I velocity constants, the apparatus was set in single mixing mode and a fixed concentration of enzyme (∼4 μm prior mixing) was mixed with varying concentrations of H2O2. Only initial time points were used for the calculations. For concentrations below a 5-fold excess, the apparent velocity constants were deduced from the slope of the variation of the OD at the compound I/compound II isosbestic point versus time. For concentrations above a 5-fold excess, a single exponential decrease model in the form of a + b × [exp(–k × t)] was used to calculate the apparent velocity constant from the variation of the OD at the compound I/compound II isosbestic point versus time (396 nm for the commercial enzyme, 398 nm for the wild type, 397 nm for both mutants before H2O2 treatment, and 400 nm after treatment). For the measurement of compound II velocity constants, the apparatus was set in double mixing mode; a fixed concentration of enzyme (∼8 μm prior mixing) was mixed with 1 equivalent of H2O2. The aging time was set at 300 ms except for the F41E mutant before H2O2 treatment, for which a 5-s aging time was employed. The resulting compound I solution was then mixed with varying concentrations of guaiacol and the variation of the OD at the compound II/resting state isosbestic point (410 nm for the commercial enzyme and the wild type, 412 nm for the S73E mutant, 405 nm for F41E mutant before and 417 nm after H2O2 treatment) versus time was plotted. An equation of the form OD = a × [exp(–k × t) + b × (1 – exp(–k × t))] was used to model the reduction of compound I, and only the first time points were used because the excess of guaiacol was less than 10-fold.RESULTSStructure Superposition and Choice of Mutations—MPO is the reference enzyme for the mammalian peroxidases because its crystal structure has been determined (1Fiedler T.J. Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11964-11971Google Scholar, 22Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 203: 803-816Google Scholar). No other mammalian peroxidase structure is available. The MPO structure makes it possible to define the precise location and arrangement of each of the three bonds that link the protein to the heme. To determine which residues in HRP might be suitable candidates for the introduction of active site carboxylate side chains, the x-ray structure of HRP (18Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Poulos T.L. Nature. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Google Scholar) was superimposed on that of MPO. The only constraint applied was conservation of the average heme plane. As noted elsewhere for MPO/prostaglandin H synthase and yeast cytochrome c peroxidase/lignin peroxidase (14Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar), the superposition revealed striking similarities in the secondary structures immediately surrounding the iron porphyrin (Fig. 1, a and b). Helix H2 (residues 84–97) of MPO and helix B (residues 31–44) of HRP, which bear the corresponding distal histidines, coincided almost perfectly. Likewise, MPO helix H8 (residues 326–338) superimposed very well on HRP helix F and the residues immediately following it (161–171); both segments bear the proximal histidines. On the same side, the first segment of helix H12 of MPO (417–423) was found in a similar position to helix H of HRP (244–250), even if the length and orientation of the two helices differed as the distance from the heme increased. It is to be noted that these two segments include Asn421 of MPO and Asp247 of HRP, respectively, which confer a partial imidazolate character to their respective proximal histidine. At the approximate position of the MPO 234–243 segment bearing two of the three heme covalent bonds, we found in HRP a similar poorly defined loop (residues 67–78), a region that is among the most variable in class III peroxidases (23Henriksen A. Mirza O. Indiani C. Teilum K. Smulevich G. Welinder K. Gajhede M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 108-115Google Scholar). Finally, and to a lesser degree, two additional helical segments further away from the heme were found in comparable positions: part of helix H6 of MPO (287–300) and helix D of HRP (97–112), and part of helix H17 of MPO (493–504) and helix J of HRP (273–283). The HRP segments identified by this superposition of structures are almost the same as the ones invoked as being the remnants of an ancient gene duplication (24Morita Y. Funatsu J. Mikami B. Welinder K.G. Rasmussen S.K. Pemnel C. Greppin H. Plant Peroxidases: Biochemistry and Physiology. University of Geneva, Geneva1993: 35-42Google Scholar). As previously noted (14Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar), the heme in HRP was “flipped” by a 180° rotation about the β-meso/δ-meso axis relative to that in MPO. The result of this was an exchange of pyrrole rings A and B of MPO with pyrrole rings D and C of HRP.The proximal His95 and His42 of MPO and HRP, respectively, as well as the distal His336 and His170, and Asn421 and Asp247 superimpose almost perfectly (Fig. 1c). Surprisingly, Arg239 of MPO is found at a position roughly equivalent to that of Asn70 of HRP, a residue that is known to interact directly with His42 to increase the basicity of the latter. Arg38 of HRP was found at the same spatial location as Gln91 of MPO, one of the key residues in the active site hydrogen bond network of MPO (1Fiedler T.J. Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11964-11971Google Scholar). The chain of hydrogen bonds leading from the distal histidines is quite different in the two; in MPO, His95 interacts via a water molecule with Asp237 and His250, whereas in HRP, His42 forms a hydrogen bond with Asn70, which in turn interacts with Glu64 (25Tanaka M. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2629-2638Google Scholar). Finally, the location of the distal calcium binding sites was strikingly similar in the two enzymes (data not shown).We surveyed the residues in HRP closest to the methyl heme substituents in the superimposed MPO structure, reasoning that a covalent ester link might be formed between any of them if it were correctly located relative to a protein carboxylate group. We limited our search to the distal cavity, as the covalent heme-protein links in the mammalian peroxidases appear to be located on this side of the heme. The closest residue lying under the 1-methyl is Gly69, a residue that has been implicated as part of the substrate-binding site (26Henriksen A. Welinder K.G. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2241-2248Google Scholar). When mutation of this residue into a glutamate was simulated, the calculated configurations with the acidic side chain pointing toward the heme gave a best distance of ∼5 Å between the closest oxygen and the 1-methyl carbon atom (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, the carboxylate group of this simulated G69E mutant was also found within ∼5 Å of the 8-methyl group. Because a glutamate gave a quite long calculated distance, an aspartate substitution was not modeled. Next, the closest and most ideally placed residue relative to the 3-methyl was Phe41. This residue has been shown to impede access of reducing substrates to the compound I ferryl oxygen, thus suppressing the oxygenase activity of HRP (19Ator M.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1542-1551Google Scholar, 27Ortiz de Montellano P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 89-107Google Scholar). Computer modeling of a Phe → Glu mutation this time gave much shorter distances, with the distance between the γ-oxygen and 3-carbon being as short as 2.5 Å (Fig. 2b). Taking into account the pyrrole ring “swapping” between HRP and MPO mentioned earlier, position 41 turned out to be the strict spatial equivalent of position 94 in MPO. The only reasonable candidate for a bond with the 5-methyl was Leu37. This residue has not been assigned any function in the HRP active site, but directed evolution experiments have shown that its mutation into an isoleucine improves enzymatic activity (28Morawski B. Lin Z. Cirino P. Joo H. Bandara G. Arnold F.H. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 377-384Google Scholar). Modeling of a glutamate or an aspartate (an isoleucine steric analog) at this site gave the nearest approach distances of 1.5 and 2.1 Å, respectively (Fig. 2a). Both mutations were therefore selected. Finally, the closest and best oriented residue with respect to the 8-methyl group is Ser73. This serine may help to stabilize one of the heme propionates in both soybean seed coat peroxidase and HRP (23Henriksen A. Mirza O. I"
https://openalex.org/W2088383173,"The assembly of FtsZ plays a major role in bacterial cell division, and it is thought that the assembly dynamics of FtsZ is a finely regulated process. Here, we show that ruthenium red is able to modulate FtsZ assembly in vitro. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of ruthenium red on microtubule polymerization, we found that a substoichiometric concentration of ruthenium red strongly increased the light-scattering signal of FtsZ assembly. Further, sedimentable polymer mass was increased by 1.5- and 2-fold in the presence of 2 and 10 microm ruthenium red, respectively. In addition, ruthenium red strongly reduced the GTPase activity and prevented dilution-induced disassembly of FtsZ polymers. Electron microscopic analysis showed that 4-10 microm of ruthenium red produced thick bundles of FtsZ polymers. The significant increase in the light-scattering signal and pelletable polymer mass in the presence of ruthenium red seemed to be due to the bundling of FtsZ protofilaments into larger polymers rather than the actual increase in the level of polymeric FtsZ. Furthermore, ruthenium red was found to copolymerize with FtsZ, and the copolymerization of substoichiometric amounts of ruthenium red with FtsZ polymers promoted cooperative assembly of FtsZ that produced large bundles. Calcium inhibited the binding of ruthenium red to FtsZ. However, a concentration of calcium 1000-fold higher than that of ruthenium red was required to produce similar effects on FtsZ assembly. Ruthenium red strongly modulated FtsZ polymerization, suggesting the presence of an important regulatory site on FtsZ and suggesting that a natural ligand, which mimics the action of ruthenium red, may regulate the assembly of FtsZ in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2092607555,"The Hox protein family consists of homeodomain-containing transcription factors that are primary determinants of cell fate during animal development. Specific Hox function appears to rely on protein-protein interactions; however, the partners involved in these interactions and their function are largely unknown. Disconnected Interacting Protein 1 (DIP1) was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a 0–12-h Drosophila embryo library designed to identify proteins that interact with Ultrabithorax (Ubx), a Drosophila Hox protein. The Ubx ·DIP1 physical interaction was confirmed using phage display, immunoprecipitation, pull-down assays, and gel retardation analysis. Ectopic expression of DIP1 in wing and haltere imaginal discs malforms the adult structures and enhances a decreased Ubx expression phenotype, establishing a genetic interaction. Ubx can generate a ternary complex by simultaneously binding its target DNA and DIP1. A large region of Ubx, including the repression domain, is required for interaction with DIP1. These more variable sequences may be key to the differential Hox function observed in vivo. The Ubx ·DIP1 interaction prevents transcriptional activation by Ubx in a modified yeast one-hybrid assay, suggesting that DIP1 may modulate transcriptional regulation by Ubx. The DIP1 sequence contains two dsRNA-binding domains, and DIP1 binds double-stranded RNA with a 1000-fold higher affinity than either single-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA.

During animal development, differential transcription regulation is key to subdivision and specification of a diverse array of tissues. Position along the anterior-posterior axis in developing metazoans is specified by the Hox transcription factor family (1Biggin M.D. McGinnis W.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Alterations in expression patterns of Hox transcription factors can rearrange appendages, a dramatic example of their capacity to instigate developmental programs (1Biggin M.D. McGinnis W. Development. 1997; 124: 4425-4433PubMed Google Scholar). However, Hox transcription factors bind short, partially degenerate DNA binding sites via the highly conserved homeodomain, suggesting that DNA recognition solely by the homeodomain is insufficient to achieve the precise regulatory control required for Hox function in vivo (2Manak J.R. Scott M.P. Development. 1994; 120: 61-71Google Scholar). Further, members of the Hox family can activate or repress transcription, often of the same gene, depending on the cellular context (3Beachy P.A. Krasnow M.A. Gavis E.R. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 1069-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4Vigano M.A. Rocco G.D. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6201-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite this variability, genetic and molecular studies demonstrate that Hox proteins specifically regulate a large number of genes throughout the genetic hierarchy (1Biggin M.D. McGinnis W. Development. 1997; 124: 4425-4433PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weatherbee S.D. Halder G. Kim J. Hudson A. Carroll S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1474-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, Hox proteins require a mechanism to assimilate external information to produce differential DNA binding and transcription regulation functions. The function of many transcription factor families relies on a complex web of protein interactions to generate the requisite specificity, diversity, and reliability of transcriptional outcomes (6Bondos S.E. Tan X.-X. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2001; 11: 145-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wolberger C. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Indeed, the transcriptional activity of Hox proteins is influenced by homomeric and heteromeric cooperative DNA binding (9Piper D.E. Batchelor A.H. Chang C.-P. Cleary M.L. Wolberger C.

Thus, interactions with heterologous proteins may provide the functional specificity requisite for Hox function in vivo. Despite the potential importance of these interactions, very little is known about the range of Hox protein partners or the role of these partners in development. Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is a Hox protein that orchestrates development of the posterior thorax of Drosophila melanogaster. Ubx specifies parasegments 5 and 6 and contributes to the differentiation of more posterior segments (6Bondos S.E. Tan X.-X. Crit. Rev.

Development. 1994; 120: 1983-1995PubMed Google Scholar). Within these regions, Ubx influences midgut, central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, leg, and haltere development (6Bondos S.E. Tan X.-X. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2001; 11: 145-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Christen B. Bienz M. Mech.

Several functional domains have been identified in Ubx (Fig. 1). Our previous work has shown that a transcription activation domain resides between residues 159 and 242, and transcription activation levels are further enhanced by inclusion of amino acids 68–158 (21Tan X.-X. Bondos S. Li L. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2774-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immediately following the activation domain is the YPWM motif and the homeodomain. The C terminus of the protein contains a glutamine/alaninerich region that contributes to transcription repression (22Ronshaugen M. McGinnis N. McGinnis W. Nature. 2002; 415: 914-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 23Galant R. Carroll S.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 910-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Although aspects of the transcription regulatory domains have been identified, the mechanisms, including protein interactions, that mediate these functions remain unknown. To identify potential protein partners that may modulate the function of Ubx, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. A partner prominently identified in our two-hybrid cDNA library screen was Disconnected Interacting Protein 1 (DIP1), which contains a putative nuclear localization signal and two double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs). Global overexpression of DIP1 causes embryonic lethality (24De Sousa D. Mukhopadhyay M. Pelka P. Zhao X. Dey B.K. Robert V. Pélisson A. Bucheton A. Campos A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38040-38050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, specific expression of DIP1 in the eye-antennal imaginal disc generates duplications of antenna and mouth structures and loss of the arista, reflecting aberrant expression of homothorax and spalt major and duplication of the distalless expression domain (24De Sousa D. Mukhopadhyay M. Pelka P. Zhao X. Dey B.K. Robert V. Pélisson A. Bucheton A. Campos A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38040-38050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DIP1 also interacts with other transcription regulators, including Disco and Su(var)3–9 (24De Sousa D. Mukhopadhyay M. Pelka P. Zhao X. Dey B.K. Robert V. Pélisson A. Bucheton A. Campos A.R. J.

Reuter G. 17th European Drosophila Research Conference in Edinburgh (UK). 2001; (F8, September 1–5, 2001, Edinburgh, UK)Google Scholar). Thus DIP1, like Ubx, can alter transcription regulation to impact developmental programs, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. Herein, we detail a physical interaction between Ubx and DIP1 using modified yeast two-hybrid methods, phage display, immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down assays, and gel retardation supershifts. In addition, a genetic interaction between ubx and DIP1 is established. Formation of a DIP1 ·Ubx ·DNA ternary complex and the demonstration that DIP1 represses transcription activation by Ubx in a modified yeast one-hybrid assay suggest a physiological role for the interaction. Intriguingly, DIP1 is shown to bind dsRNA with extremely high affinity. The strong interaction of a Hox protein with an RNA-binding protein implies that influences on Hox activity may be wider than previously appreciated. The “interaction trap” method developed by the Brent Laboratory for yeast two-hybrid screens (26Golemis E.A. Serebriiskii I. Finley Jr., R.L. Kolonin M.G. Gyuris J. Brent R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, 1999: 20.1.1-20.1.40Google Scholar) has been utilized in these experiments. Matchmaker LexA two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used, and a 0–12 h D. melanogaster embryonic cDNA library (27Finley Jr., R.L. Thomas B.J. Zipursky S.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3011-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was a gift from Roger Brent (The Molecular Sciences Institute, Berkeley, CA). The plasmid pLexA-UbxΔN216 (21Tan X.-X. Bondos S. Li L. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2774-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) contains coding sequences for amino acids 216–389 of the Ubx Ib isoform fused to the LexA DNA binding domain, a construct initially used to eliminate transcriptional activation by Ubx Ib alone. Using standard methods (28Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 29Chen D.-C. Yang B.-C. Kuo T.-T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), the yeast strain EGY48 was stably co-transformed with the plasmid pLexA-UbxΔN216 and the reporter plasmid p8op-lacZ prior to the introduction of the D. melanogaster embryonic cDNA library fused to the B42 activation domain in the pJG42AD vector. Transformants were plated on SD minimal medium lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan and containing galactose as the carbon source. Positive colonies were selected by blue color, and DNA was isolated and sequenced. Full-length constructs of Ubx Ib and DIP1-c isoforms were also utilized in this assay. The Ubx Ib ·DIP1-c interaction was reassayed in the yeast two-hybrid system using Ubx proline mutant 1 (21Tan X.-X. Bondos S. Li L. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2774-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a full-length Ubx Ib construct incapable of transcription activation. Finally, the yeast two-hybrid screen was repeated using pLexA-DIP1 and pJG42AD-Ubx. In this reverse yeast two-hybrid assay, yeast were plated on medium containing glucose to inhibit expression of the toxic Ubx-B42 chimera. Once the colonies were well formed, they were replica-plated onto galactose plates to induce protein expression. The overlapping cDNA and expressed sequence tags from the Berkeley FlyBase were aligned and combined using DNA Strider 1.2. Homology searches of DIP1 were completed using the Prosite Data base (30Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) and the Blast program (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59926) Google Scholar). The T7Select Phage Display System (Novagen) was used according to the manual. DIP1-c, the longest isoform, was cloned into T7Select 1–1b vector between the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites and was fused to the region encoding the C terminus of the 10B capsid protein gene of T7 phage to display, on average, ≤1 DIP1-c protein on each product phage as a fusion protein. Phage were amplified, and a specific amount of phage lysate containing either 500 or 1,000 phages was applied to the surface of a Petri dish upon which cell extracts containing biotinylated Ubx Ib had been immobilized (see below). Controls utilized cell extracts with vector lacking the Ubx Ib coding region. The dish was washed five times with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20. Phage that had been captured by Ubx Ib were eluted with 1% SDS. Two 20-min elutions at room temperature were collected and were diluted 20-fold with LB medium. The phage lysate was titered with Escherichia coli BLT5615 both before and after biopanning. These data were used to calculate the percentage of phage retained. Ubx Ib, cloned into pET3c between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, was a gift from Philip A. Beachy (Johns Hopkins University). Ubx Ib was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified as described previously (32Bondos S.E. Bicknell A. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 316: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To produce biotinylated Ubx Ib for phage display assays, Ubx Ib was cloned into the pDW363 vector (33Tsao K.-L. DeBarbieri B. Michel H. Waugh D.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) between the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. Biotinylated Ubx Ib was expressed in E. coli AR120. Cell growth and protein induction were performed as described (32Bondos S.E. Bicknell A. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 316: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cell pellets from a 200-ml growth were resuspended in 2 ml of 10% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 0.5 mm PMSF and 0.8 mg/ml lysozyme and frozen at -80 °C. The frozen cell pellet was thawed on ice and diluted with an equal volume of 10% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.8 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT, and 10 μl of 100 mm PMSF. The cells were incubated on ice for 45 min. Subsequently, 4 μl of 10 mg/ml DNase I was added before a further 30-min incubation at room temperature. The slurry was centrifuged for 30 min at 11,000 × g, and the supernatant was applied to avidin-coated Petri dishes to immobilize biotinylated Ubx Ib. The plates were washed with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, to remove all bacterial proteins prior to the addition of phage. DIP1-c was cloned between the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites in the pET28a vector (Novagen) to express an N-terminally His6-tagged DIP1-c in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Overnight Luria broth culture (8 ml) was used to inoculate each of 12 LB cultures (1 liter) and grown at 37 °C. At midlog phase, DIP1-c expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were harvested 2 h later. Cells collected from 2-liter growths and stored at -20 °C were thawed on ice and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm imidazole, 5% glucose, 10 mm DTT). After lysis, DNase I and RNase A (each 20 mg/ml) were added. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was filtered before loading onto a 5-ml HiTRAP heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C on an Akta fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). The heparin column was pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glucose, 10 mm DTT, passed through 0.2-μm filter, and degassed) and washed with Buffer A after loading the protein. DIP1-c was eluted with an 8-column volume gradient of Buffer A to Buffer A with 1 m NaCl, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. DIP1-c fractions were pooled and loaded onto a ∼2.5-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer at 4 °C. The column was washed with lysis buffer with 20 mm imidazole, and DIP1-c was eluted in lysis buffer with 100 mm imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. DIP1-c fractions were dialyzed twice at 4 °C against 1-liter exchanges (1 h each) of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5% glucose, 10 mm DTT. Biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) was added at a 1:100 dilution, mixed well by inverting the tube, and allowed to cleave His6-DIP1-c for 16 h at 4 °C. The protein mixture was mixed with 100 μl of avidin (Novagen) and 500–1000 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin slurries and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Centrifugation at 2,200 × g for about 10 s removed the resins along with biotinylated thrombin and His6 tag released from DIP1-c. The resulting DIP1-c was dialyzed at 4 °C against two 1-liter exchanges (1 h each) of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glucose, 10 mm DTT and stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week because freezing abrogates protein function. Every other day, solid DTT was introduced to about 100 μm to prevent oxidation effects on protein function. Equimolar aliquots of purified Ubx Ib, purified DIP1-c, 2H.10“7” anti-Ubx antibody, and 10H.7 anti-Ubx antibody were combined and incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C overnight. Hybridoma cells lines producing these antibodies were a gift from A. Javier Lopez (The John Hopkins School of Medicine) (34Lopez A.J. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9924-9928Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Control incubations included either Ubx Ib or DIP1-c alone with the anti-Ubx antibodies. Each mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer with Tween 20 and recentrifuged for 5 min to dilute any remaining supernatant. The supernatant, wash, and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The coding region of full-length Ubx Ib was subcloned into the pGEX-6P-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) via the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites to produce pGEX-Ubx. The vector was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown in 1 liter of LB at 37 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.3–0.4. Expression of GST-Ubx was induced with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside followed by growth for an additional 2 h. Cells (200 ml) were harvested at 2,500 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of 10% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.8 mg/ml lysozyme, with 10 μl of 100 mm PMSF. Cell pellets were stored at -20 °C. Cell pellets thawed on ice were diluted with an equal volume of 10% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.8 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT, with 10 μlof100 mm PMSF. After 45 min, 4 μl of 10 mg/ml DNase I were added, and the lysate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The slurry was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used immediately. DIP1-c was either added as 200 μg of purified protein (full-length only, with or without His6 tag) or as an in vitro transcription/translation reaction (full-length and DIP1-c deletions, TNT T7 PCR Quick Master Mix; Promega). Template DNA for the TNT reaction was amplified by PCR in which the 5′ primer contained the sequence 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAACAGCC(C/A)CCATGG-3′ required to initiate transcription and translation. The resulting products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and 2 μg of purified DNA digested with BamHI was used in two reactions for each DIP1-c deletion. The TNT products were tested for expression levels, and then divided between GST pull-down experiments with cell lysates expressing GST-Ubx or lysates from cells without the pGEX-Ubx vector as a negative control. The GST pull-down protocol was followed as described by Amersham Biosciences using Glutathione Sepharose™ 4b beads. The Drosophila line containing the UAS-DIP1-c insertion was created by Alain Pélisson (CNRS, France) and obtained from Ana Campos (McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada). The Df(1) LB6/Dp(1;Y) line was provided by Bloomington Stock Center (stock number 5999). The P{GawB}BxMS1096 Gal4 flies were acquired from Sean Carroll (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), and flies containing the Ubxbx-34e gypsy insertion were received from Bloomington Stock Center (stock number 457). The S880 wild-type fly line was obtained from Michael Stern (Rice University, Houston, Texas). DIP1-c was ectopically expressed in the wing and haltere using the Gal4-UAS system (35Brand A. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by crossing MS1096-Gal4 virgins to UAS-DIP1-c males, producing progeny heterozygous for both elements. Progeny exhibited a fully penetrant shriveled wing phenotype, which was lethal in most males, probably due to strong expression of DIP1-c in males, since MS1096-Gal4 is on the X chromosome. To evaluate a genetic interaction, heterozygous female virgins from the previous cross were mated to males homozygous for Ubxbx-34e, although the same results are obtained when heterozygous males and Ubxbx-34e virgins are used. All progeny therefore harbored the Ubxbx-34e insertion, and progeny that also contained the Gal4 and UAS elements were identified by the shriveled wing phenotype generated by DIP1-c ectopic expression (see “Results”). Genetic interactions were also evaluated in crosses between Ubxbx-34e homozygote virgins and Dp(1;Y) males. Pictures of halteres remaining on the fly and dissected wings and halteres were acquired with a Leica MZF1111 microscope fitted with a Zeiss AxioCam MRC digital camera and using Axiovision software. Flies were submerged in ethanol to dissect wings and halteres, which were mounted in 80% glycerol. Images of dissected halteres were also acquired using a Zeiss AxioPlan 2 microscope and Metamorph software. RNA purification and Northern blotting of the S880 line of D. melanogaster followed previously described procedures (36Soehnge H. Huang X. Becker M. Whitley P. Conover D. Stern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13262-13267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using the entire DIP1 gene as a probe. The Ambion RETROscript kit was used for reverse transcriptase PCR, and random decamers were used for priming first strand synthesis. Primers directed at the full-length DIP1-c sequence were used for all subsequent rounds of PCR. Otherwise, protocols in the Ambion manual were followed. Poly(I)-poly(C) dsRNA and poly(C) single-stranded RNA (Amersham Biosciences) were hydrolyzed according to Ref. 37Krovat B.C. Jantsch M.F. J. Biol.

Shuman S. Virology. 1996; 217: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was adapted as follows. His6-DIP1-c and BSA were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45-μm pore size; Schleicher & Schuell) in separate rows containing 0.43, 0.87, 1.74, 3.04, 4.35, 8.69, 13.0, and 17.4 μg of protein using dot blot microfiltration. Membranes were then incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.04% BSA for 1 h at room temperature with constant agitation, followed by a 2-h incubation in a rotating hybridization chamber with 1 × 105 cpm/ml 32P-labeled poly(I)-poly(C) at 2.24 × 10-10m or poly(C) at 4.95 × 10-9m. After three washes in buffer (10 min of incubation/wash), membranes were air-dried and exposed to a Fuji phosphorimaging plate for 16 h. Data were analyzed using MacBAS version 2.0 software. Several RNAs, used for gel retardation experiments, were produced by in vitro transcription. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) TAR RNA—The DNA template contained the sequence of the TAR RNA (5′-GGCAGAUCUGAGCCUGGGAGCUCUCUGCC-3′) behind the T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) promoter (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′). This template (1 μm), resuspended in water, was annealed with the T7 primer oligonucleotide (1.2 μm). Adenovirus VA1 RNA—The template was amplified by PCR from pVA1, a gift from Goran Akusjarvi (Uppsala University, Sweden). The primers, 5′-ATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGCACTCTTCCGTGGTCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-AAAAGGAGCGCTCCCCCGTTGTC-3′, were used to generate a 182-base pair product that contains the VA1 sequence under the T7 RNAP control. The PCR product was purified using the Qiagen PCR Clean-up kit, and the DNA template was resuspended in water. In Vitro Transcription—Each transcription reaction consisted of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 2 mm spermidine, 0.01% Triton X-100, 25 mm MgCl2, each NTP at 4 mm, 10 mm DTT, 1 μm DNA template (HIV TAR or adenovirus VA1), and 50 μg/ml T7 RNAP (a gift from Yousif Shamoo, Rice University). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. To stop the reactions, an equal amount of 2× formamide solution (90% (v/v) formamide, 1× TBE (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis F.

Our previous studies show that mitsugumin 29 (MG29), a synaptophysin-related protein localized in the triad junction of skeletal muscle, serves an essential role in muscle Ca2+ signaling by regulating the process of store-operated Ca2+ entry.

Mitsugumin29 (MG29) is a novel membrane protein localized specifically to the triad junction of skeletal muscle (5Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Komazaki S. Ohmi K. Nishi M. Iino M. Miyata A. Kangawa K. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence of MG29 shares ∼45% homology to synaptophysin, a family of proteins with presumed roles in secretion and neurotransmitter release (6Johnston P.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1265-1273Google Scholar, 7Alder J. Lu B. Valtorta F. Greengard P. Poo M. Science. 1992; 257: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The MG29 protein appears to participate in the excitation-contraction coupling process of skeletal muscle, since mutant mice lacking the MG29 gene exhibit apparent reduction in contractile force, with altered structure of the triad junction (8Nishi M. Komazaki S. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Noda T. Iino M. Takeshima H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and increased susceptibility to fatigue of the skeletal muscle (9Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M.

Several studies have suggested a central role for the participation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and intracellular Ca2+ release in the initiation of apoptosis (11Breckenridge D.G. Germain M.

Our previous studies have shown that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores via activation of the RyR/Ca2+ release channel could induce apoptosis (14Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J.

Here we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MG29 can influence the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis through changes of the RyR/Ca2+ release function. We show that co-expression of MG29 and RyR in cultured cells leads to apoptotic cell death resulting from depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and the purified MG29 protein can enhance activity of the RyR/Ca2+ release channel incorporated into the lipid bilayer membrane. Our data provide evidence for a functional interaction between the RyR and MG29 proteins, which adds insights into the function of MG29 in excitation-contraction coupling of muscle cells, and the cellular mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in apoptosis. Cloning and Mutagenesis—The cDNA encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was ligated to the 5′ end of the MG29 cDNA (5Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Komazaki S. Ohmi K. Nishi M. Iino M. Miyata A. Kangawa K. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) to yield the GFP-MG29 fusion construct. The GFP-RyR construct was obtained by replacing the first 290 amino acids of the rabbit skeletal muscle RyR with GFP (16Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Zang W. Balke C.W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The E4032A RyR mutant was generated using site-directed mutagenesis, as described in previous studies (14Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfection, and DNA Laddering—c1148 and mg-5 are stable clones of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells permanently expressing the RyR and MG29 proteins, respectively. The cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Transfections of GFP-MG29 into c1148 cells and GFP-RyR into mg-5 cells were mediated by the LipofectAMINE reagent (15Pan Z. Bhat M.B. Nieminen A.L. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32257-32263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Zang W. Balke C.W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. J. Gen.

J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA were collected from CHO cells transfected with various plasmids, and electrophoresis was performed (14Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—For subcellular localization of GFP-MG29 and GFP-RyR transiently expressed in CHO cells, the cells were grown on glass-bottomed microwell dishes and visualized with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 or Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (18Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.-W. Ma J. Nieminen A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For immunolocalization of RyR stably expressed in the c1148 cells or caveolin in CHO cells, the cells were first treated with antibody against RyR (mAb 34C) or caveolin-1 (pAb C3237, Sigma) and then labeled with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with Texas Red. To monitor the cell death process, 10 μm Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) was added to the culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C (14Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Separate filter sets for GFP (488 nm excitation, a 500–550 nm band pass emission), Texas Red (543 nm excitation, 560 nm long pass emission), and Hoechst (351 nm excitation, 385–470 emission) were used for image acquisitions. Intracellular Ca2+ Measurement—The different clones of CHO cells (parental, c1148, mg-5; and after transient transfection with GFP-MG29 or GFP-RyR) were loaded with 2 μm Fura 2-AM for 30 min at 37 °C, in a balanced salt solution (14Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The release of intracellular Ca2+ in individual cells was measured following exposure to either caffeine or ATP in a Ca2+-free solution by rapid solution exchange. Due to the apoptosis process, the Ca2+ measurements with c1148 cells transfected with GFP-MG29 or mg-5 cells transfected with GFP-RyR were performed 14–17 h after transfection. GFP fluorescence was used to select for transfected cells that are in the pre-apoptotic stage. Vesicle Isolation and Protein Purification—Microsomal membrane vesicles containing MG29 or RyR proteins were isolated from the mg-5 or c1148 cells following the procedure of Bhat et al. (17Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For purification of the MG29 proteins, the vesicles were solubilized with 1% CHAPS in a buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The solubilized proteins were loaded onto a CNBr-activated Sepharose column that had the anti-MG29 antibody (mAb 1007) bound to it. The column was washed, and the MG29 protein was eluted with 0.3% CHAPS, 0.5 m NaSCN, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4). The NaSCN was removed from the final buffer through dilution dialysis. Electrophysiology—Lipid bilayer membranes were formed with a mixture of phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylethanolamine:cholesterol (6:6:1). Incorporation of the Ca2+-release channel in bilayers was achieved by addition of microsomal membrane vesicles isolated from the c1148 cells to the cis solution, under a concentration gradient of 200 mm (cis)/50 mm (trans) cesium gluconate (17Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The purified MG29 was added to the cis solution to study the interaction with the Ca2+-release channel. Using monoclonal antibodies against triad junctional proteins from rabbit skeletal muscle, we have identified MG29, a membrane protein specifically localized to the triad junction of skeletal muscle. The primary structure deduced by cDNA cloning revealed that MG29 is a novel member of the synaptophysin family, with ∼45% identity in amino acid sequence to synaptophysin (5Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Komazaki S. Ohmi K. Nishi M. Iino M. Miyata A. Kangawa K. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding either MG29 or RyR from rabbit skeletal muscle were introduced into the CHO cells using the Ca2+-phosphate precipitation method (19Takekura H. Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Takahashi M. Tanabe T. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Following selection with G418, individual clones of CHO cells stably expressing either MG29 (mg-5) or RyR (c1148) were selected (Fig. 1a). The levels of protein expression in these cells were maintained in multiple passages, suggesting that the CHO cells can take up well these exogenous MG29 or RyR proteins. For subcellular localization of MG29 expressed in CHO cells, GFP-MG29 fusion construct was generated. Confocal microscopic images indicate that GFP-MG29 can be clearly visualized at the cell surface membrane in a punctuated fashion 2 days after transfection (Fig. 1b). A similar punctated-vesicular labeling of MG29 was also observed in mg-5 cells, with a monoclonal antibody against MG29 (mAb 1007; data not shown). In co-localization studies, a certain degree of overlap in the membrane distribution of MG29 and caveolin-1, an endogenous caveolae-specific protein present in CHO cells, could be observed in CHO cells (Fig. 1b). Such characteristic patterns of MG29 expression in CHO cells suggest that as yet unknown cellular mechanisms probably result in concentration of MG29 at certain subdomains of the plasma membrane (e.g. rafts or caveolae). These data are also consistent with the specific localization of MG29 at the transverse-tubule membrane of matured skeletal muscle cells (20Komazaki S. Nishi M. Kangawa K. Takeshima H. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 215: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transient expression of GFP-MG29 in c1148 cells revealed a different pattern of fluorescence distribution (Fig. 1c). The c1148 cells are bigger than the parental CHO cells, as has been reported in our previous studies (16Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Zang W. Balke C.W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It appears that the presence of RyR in the ER membrane facilitates the retention of GFP-MG29 to the perinuclear regions and also causes apparent aggregation of GFP-MG29 (Fig. 1c). The distribution of caveolin-1 in c1148 cells, however, did not appear to be different from that of the parental CHO cells (Fig. 1d) This result suggests that the presence of RyR in the ER membrane likely alter the trafficking or processing properties of MG29. To test the potential interaction between RyR and MG29, we used co-expression in CHO cells. However, multiple attempts to generate stable clones of CHO cells co-expressing MG29 and RyR failed, because the cells always underwent apoptosis after co-transfection. This apoptotic process occurred either when the MG29 cDNA was introduced into the c1148 cells (n = 7) or when the RyR cDNA was introduced into the mg-5 cells (n = 6). Transient expression of GFP-MG29 in c1148 cells and GFP-RyR in mg-5 cells were therefore used to monitor the cell death process. To differentiate apoptosis from necrosis, the cells were loaded with a Hoechst 33342 dye, which labeled the nuclear chromatin of a cell undergoing apoptosis (14Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2a, expression of GFP-MG29 in c1148 cells could be observed within 12 h after transfection, at which time most of the cells appear to be healthy. By 36 h, a lot of the cells started to die as revealed by the blebbing of the plasma membrane, diffused distribution of GFP fluorescence, and fragmented staining of the nucleus by the Hoechst dye. By 72 h, nearly all the transfected cells were dead. A similar pattern of cell death process was also observed with the mg-5 cells transfected with GFP-RyR (not shown, n = 6). Moreover, electrophoresis of genomic DNA isolated from c1148 cells transfected with MG29 revealed characteristic pattern of DNA laddering, a hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the parental CHO cells and those cells stably expressing the E4032A mutant of RyR did not exhibit apparent DNA laddering following identical treatment with the MG29 cDNA (Fig. 2b). Since the E4032A RyR mutant is know to have defective Ca2+ release channel function (21Xiao B. Masumiya H. Jiang D. Wang R. Sei Y. Zhang L. Murayama T. Ogawa Y. Lai F.A. Wagenknecht T. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41778-41785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and we have shown that stable expression of E4032A did not affect the proliferation and apoptosis of CHO cells (14Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the MG29 overexpression-induced apoptosis of c1148 cells is probably related to the RyR-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER membrane. Further studies show that co-expression of MG29 and RyR in the ER membrane leads to drastic changes in the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in CHO cells (Fig. 3). The release of Ca2+ from the ER membrane was measured in individual CHO cells following stimulation with 10 mm caffeine or 200 μm ATP. Caffeine is a known activator of the RyR/Ca2+ release channel, and ATP is an agonist of the purinergic receptor on the plasma membrane, which activates the IP3 receptor on the ER membrane via generation of IP3 (22Iredale P.A. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3a, the parental CHO cells do not respond to caffeine but contain active IP3 receptors as indicated by the rapid release of Ca2+ triggered by ATP (n = 30). Both caffeine and ATP caused rapid release of intracellular Ca2+ in the c1148 cells (Fig. 3b, n = 66/67). Expression of MG29 in CHO cells alone did not affect the ER Ca2+ pool, since the response of mg-5 cells to ATP was similar to the parental CHO cells (Fig. 3c, n = 8). 14–17 h after transfection of GFP-MG29 into c1148 cells, the amount of Ca2+ in the ER was diminished, since the cells showed significantly reduced responses to either caffeine or ATP (Fig. 3e). This was likely due to the activation of RyR, because CHO cells stably transfected with the E4032A mutant did not show changes of their ER Ca2+ store upon introduction of GFP-MG29 (Fig. 3d). Similarly, expression of GFP-RyR in mg-5 cells also resulted in reduction of the ER Ca2+ pool (Fig. 3f). The traces shown in Fig. 3, e and f, were representative of 13/17 and 8/9 experiments performed, i.e. over 75% of the transfected cells had an ER Ca2+ content that was nearly empty. These fluorescent cells, expressing both GFP-MG29 and RyR or both GFP-RyR and MG29, generally died within 24–36 h after transfection. On the other hand, non-transformed cells expressing either RyR or MG29 showed intact ER Ca2+ pools and remained viable. Thus it appears that there is a close correlation between cellular apoptosis and Ca2+ homeostasis, which has been observed in our previous studies (14Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is possible that the interaction between RyR and MG29 enhances the activity of the Ca2+ release channel or alters the trafficking and function of MG29, which leads to the depletion of Ca2+ from the ER membrane. We next purified the MG29 protein from the mg-5 cells and tested its effect on the individual RyR/Ca2+ release channel using the lipid bilayer reconstitution system (Fig. 4). Microsomal membrane vesicles were isolated from mg-5 cells and solubilized with the CHAPS detergent, from which the MG29 protein was purified to homogeneity using a monoclonal antibody affinity column (Fig. 4a). A single RyR/Ca2+ release channel was incorporated into the lipid bilayer by fusing vesicles isolated from the c1148 cells (Fig. 4b). The RyR channel had an ohmic conductance of ∼400 picosiemens, which exhibited fast transitions between the open and closed states (16Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Zang W. Balke C.W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). At a test potential of –50 mV with free [Ca2+] buffered at 220 μm and 5 mm MgCl2 added to the cytosolic solution, the channel had an average open probability of Po = 0.007 ± 0.002 (n = 4). Following addition of the purified MG29 protein (0.05–0.2 μg/ml) to the cytosolic solution, open probability of the Ca2+ release channel was increased significantly (Po = 0.052 ± 0.006, n = 4, p < 0.001), whereas the single channel current amplitude remained unchanged (Fig. 4c). This result supports a direct functional interaction between MG29 and RyR. Taken together, our data show that a functional interaction between MG29 and RyR in CHO cells enhances opening of the Ca2+ release channel, which likely causes depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ pool, leading the cells to undergo apoptosis. We also showed that the presence of RyR in the ER membrane could influence the processing and trafficking properties of MG29, causing retention of MG29 from plasma membrane to the intracellular organelles. This result is interesting but not surprising. We know that MG29 exists as an oligomer in the transverse-tubule membrane of matured skeletal muscle (23Brandt N.R. Caswell A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We also know that a significant portion of MG29 co-localize with the SR membrane in the developing skeletal muscle (20Komazaki S. Nishi M. Kangawa K. Takeshima H. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 215: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, knock-out of MG29 has been shown to cause fragmentation of the SR membrane (8Nishi M. Komazaki S. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Noda T. Iino M. Takeshima H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, there appears to be a close association between the expression pattern of MG29 and the ultrastructure of the membrane cross-talk in skeletal muscle. Perhaps, a functional interaction between MG29 and RyR could have a significant role in the overall Ca2+ signaling process in muscle cells, at least in the regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (9Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is interesting that although both MG29 and RyR are essential for the normal contractile function of the skeletal muscle, co-expression or overexpression of MG29 and RyR in CHO cells leads to eventual cell death due to the leakage of the ER Ca2+ store. Therefore, to maintain the closed state of the RyR channel at the resting state of the skeletal muscle, other cellular mechanisms must be involved. For example, the voltage sensor located on the transverse-tubule membrane has been shown to play an inhibitory role on the RyR function with muscle cells at a polarized state (24Lee E.H. Lopez J.R. Li J. Protasi F. Pessah I.N. Kim D.H. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C179-C189Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Other cytosolic proteins, such as FKBP12 or calmodulin, have been shown to associate with RyR and to modulate the active state of the Ca2+ release channel (25Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Meissner G. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d2072-d2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Reiken S. Huang F. Marx S.O. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16931-16935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It remains to be examined how the acute absence of MG29 (e.g. through small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown mechanism) in the adult skeletal muscle affects the overall Ca2+ signaling process in muscle contraction, such as store-operated Ca2+ entry, voltage-induced Ca2+ release, and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release."

The cyt b mutation A144F has been introduced in yeast by the biolistic method. This residue is located in the cyt b cd1 amphipathic helix in the quinol-oxidizing (QO) site.

IntroductionThe membrane-bound mitochondrial bc1 complex (b6f complex in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria) is a key component of the respiratory and photosynthetic electron transfer chains (see Refs. 1Brandt U.

Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Google Scholar for reviews). It catalyzes the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and couples this electron transfer to the vectorial translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It contributes to the proton-motive force, which is subsequently used by the ATP synthase to produce ATP. All bc complexes, from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, contain three subunits forming the catalytic core of the enzyme and carrying four redox centers as follows: the iron-sulfur protein (ISP) 1The abbreviations used are: ISP, iron-sulfur protein; RIP, nuclear gene coding for the iron-sulfur protein; cyt, cytochrome; bL, low potential cyt b heme; bH, high potential cyt b heme; DB, 2.3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1.4-benzoquinone; DBH2, reduced form of DB; QO, ubiquinol oxidation site on the positive side of the inner mitochondrial membrane; QI, ubiquinone reduction site on the negative side of the inner mitochondrial membrane; WT, parental strain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. with a [2Fe-2S] cluster; the monohemic cyt c1; the dihemic mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b with a low potential bL heme (Em7 around –50 mV, where Em indicates equilibrium redox midpoint potential) located near the positive side of the membrane; and a high potential bH heme (Em7 around +90 mV) located on the negative side of the membrane. In eukaryotic cells, in addition to these three conserved subunits, as many as eight additional subunits are found whose functions are poorly understood (5Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Google Scholar). The bc1 complex catalytic activity is best described by the modified Q cycle (6Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 137-139Google Scholar, 7Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Google Scholar, 8Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Google Scholar, 9Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Google Scholar). Electrons are delivered into a bifurcated pathway at the QO site. A first electron is transferred from quinol to the ISP (in the so-called high potential electron transfer pathway to cyt c1 and the soluble cyt c), resulting in the formation of an unstable semiquinone which then transfers a second electron to hemes bL and bH (in the so-called low potential pathway) across the membrane. At the QI site, on the negative side of the membrane, quinone is reduced to semiquinone by heme bH. Two molecules of ubiquinol at the QO site are thus required to reduce a quinone to quinol at the QI site. Although several models have been proposed to account for the bifurcated electron transfer at the QO site (10Ding H. Robertson D.E. Daldal F. Dutton P.L.

This movement is made possible by the presence of a flexible “hinge” region (sequence 85TADVLAMAK93 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) located after the transmembrane domain of the ISP. However, recent data (30Yan J. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20925-20933Google Scholar, 31de Vitry C. Finazzi G. Baymann F. Kallas T. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2031-2044Google Scholar) obtained with the cyt b6f complex indicate that the ISP linker domain is insensitive to changes that increase or decrease its length or flexibility.Cyt b is a hydrophobic integral membrane protein with eight transmembrane helices connected via extramembranous loops and is a central component for quinol oxidation and inhibitor binding. Numerous biochemical studies and crystallographic data showed the important role of the cd amphipathic helix of cyt b in the catalytic mechanism at the QO site. Studies of mutations in the region Trp-142 → Thr-145 in the cd1 helix in different organisms have shown the importance of this region for the electron transfer at the QO site and for the quinol and inhibitor binding. Examination of this region shows that all the residues are very well conserved. Among them, only Ala-144 had not been mutagenized previously. In this study, we replaced the alanine at position 144 by a phenylalanine in yeast cyt b. The mutation caused a respiration-deficient phenotype and drastically decreased the bc1 activity because of quinol-binding deficiency. Analysis of suppressors obtained from this non-functional mutant showed that an intragenic suppressor mutation in the QO domain of cyt b (short distance interaction) and several extragenic suppressor mutations in the flexible hinge region of the iron-sulfur protein (long range interactions) could restore the activity. The detailed characterization of the suppressors provide genetic and biochemical information on the close interactions between the quinol-oxidizing QO site in cyt b and the ISP via the hinge region.MATERIALS AND METHODSMedia, Growth Conditions, in Vivo Phosphorylation Efficiency, and Preparation of Mitochondria—Growth conditions have been described previously (32Meunier-Lemesle D. Chevillotte-Brivet P. Pajot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 151-159Google Scholar). Growth yield, phosphorylation efficiency, and growth rate were determined as outlined in Refs. 33Chevillotte-Brivet P. Meunier-Lemesle D. Eur. J.

Preparation of mitochondria was performed according to the method of Guerin et al. (35Guerin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Google Scholar) with slight modifications (32Meunier-Lemesle D. Chevillotte-Brivet P. Pajot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 151-159Google Scholar).Generation of the Site-directed Mutants—The plasmid pYGT19, which carries the HpaII-BglII yeast mitochondrial DNA fragment containing the WT intronless sequence of the cyt b gene, has been cloned into the AccI-BamHI site of pUC13 and was kindly given by Dr. J. Lazowska (CNRS, Gif sur Yvette, France). The plasmid pRG415.RIP containing the RIP gene (36Beckmann J.D. Ljungdahl P.O. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3713-3722Google Scholar) was kindly given by Prof. B. Trumpower (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH). The mutagenesis was performed using QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After verification of the sequence, the plasmids carrying the mutated cyt b or RIP gene were used for transformation. The generation of the cyt b mutant was performed by biolistic transformation as described previously (37Meunier B. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 407-412Google Scholar). For the generation of the RIP mutants, the plasmids carrying mutated versions of the RIP gene were used to transform a strain, JPJ1/B78, which combined a deletion of the genomic RIP gene with the mutant A144F cyt b. The strain derived from JPJ1, kindly given by Prof. B. Trumpower (36Beckmann J.D. Ljungdahl P.O. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3713-3722Google Scholar), was constructed by cytoduction (genetic method used both with yeast and mammalian cells to transfer the mitochondrial genome from a donor strain or cell line into the ρ0 derivative of a recipient strain).Yeast Strains for Suppressor and Biochemical Analysis—The diploid strain B78 (Table I), generated by biolistic transformation, carries the mitochondrial cyt b mutation A144F. BM2 is an isogenic WT strain. Respiration-competent clones (i.e. suppressor clones) were selected on respiratory medium using the diploid strain B78. These clones were then sporulated. Respiration-competent haploid clones were analyzed as described previously (38Dujardin G. Pajot P. Groudinsky O. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Gen.

After identification of the suppressor mutations, four pairs of diploid strains (R3, R8, R20, and R26) were constructed by crossing spores that harbored the same mutations in the RIP gene, in combination with the mutant (A144F) or the WT cyt b (Table I).

The I50 value for inhibitors is defined as the concentration required to decrease the DBH2-cyt c reductase activity by 50% and is expressed in moles of inhibitor per mol of cyt b for each strain. The relative inhibitor titer I50r is the ratio between the I50 in a mutated strain and the I50 obtained with the WT strain and indicates the resistance of a strain to the inhibitor in comparison with the WT strain (41Brasseur G.

Extinction coefficients of 6.22, 16, 18, and 24 mm–1 cm–1 were used for calculation of NADH, DB, cyt c + c1, and cyt b, respectively.Spectral Analysis—Mitochondrial membranes were suspended in MR3 buffer, and optical absorption spectra were obtained at 25 °C as described previously (32Meunier-Lemesle D. Chevillotte-Brivet P. Pajot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 151-159Google Scholar).Redox Titrations—Optical redox titrations were carried out at 25 °C as described by Dutton (42Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Google Scholar), with a flow of argon gas, using a dual wavelength DW2000 SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer. Reductive and oxidative titrations were conducted with sodium dithionite and potassium ferricyanide, respectively. Mitochondrial membranes were suspended in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7. The following redox mediators were used: potassium ferricyanide (20 μm); ferrocene-monocarboxylic acid (20 μm); 1,4-benzoquinone (20 μm); 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone (20 μm); 1,2-naphthoquinone (20 μm); phenazine methosulfate (20 μm); tetramethyl-p-benzoquinone (20 μm); 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (20 μm); 2,5-dihydroxy-p-benzoquinone (20 μm); indigo carmine (5 μm); 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (20 μm); and anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (20 μm).Presteady-state Cytochrome Reduction Kinetics by the Center O and Center I Pathways—Cyt b and cyt cc1 reduction kinetics were monitored with a dual wavelength Aminco DW2A spectrophotometer equipped with a rapidly stirred reaction cuvette, as described previously (40Brasseur G. di Rago J.-P.

Mitochondrial membranes were suspended in 0.65 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 6.5.Molecular Representation—Molecular representation was carried out by using Swiss-Pdb Viewer software (43Guex N.

Lange C. Robmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Google Scholar) (accession number 1EZV in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank) were used to visualize the regions of cyt b and ISP described in this study and to calculate the closest distances between selected atoms.RESULTSGeneration of the Respiration-deficient Mutant, Selection and Genetic Characterization of the Suppressors—The yeast mutant harboring the site-directed mutation A144F in the mitochondrially encoded cyt b was generated by the biolistic method. The conserved residue Ala-144 is located in the cyt b cd1 helix in the QO site (Fig. 1). The replacement of alanine by the bulky phenylalanine is likely to perturb the QO-binding pocket and alter the bc1 activity. The mutant strain was indeed unable to grow on respiratory medium (Table I).The stringent respiratory growth defect provided an easy handle to select suppressors. Respiration-competent clones were selected on respiratory medium. The heredity of the suppressor mutations was determined. One mitochondrial and several nuclear suppressors were found. The cyt b gene of the suppressor clones was sequenced, which confirmed the presence of the A144F mutation. As expected, a second mutation was observed in the cyt b gene of the mitochondrial suppressor clone. The secondary mutation, F179L, is located in the QO region, 4 Å from the primary mutation (Fig. 1). It is likely that the replacement of phenylalanine by the smaller and hydrophobic residue leucine reduces the steric hindrance induced by A144F and restores the function in the QO region.The nuclear suppressors were identified by directly sequencing the most probable candidate gene, which was the nuclearly encoded gene RIP, coding for the ISP. Among the different subunits of the bc1 complex, the ISP is located the closest to the QO region and Ala-144. Its hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal domain is known to move during catalysis between a position close to cyt b and a position close to cyt c1 (17Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K.

Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 445-451Google Scholar). Four mutations were observed as follows: T85A (found in four independent clones), A90G, A92D, and A92T. The mutations were all located in the hinge or tether region of the ISP (Fig. 1).In order to confirm the suppressor effect of the mutations in RIP, these changes were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in the plasmid-borne RIP gene (see “Materials and Methods”). The plasmids carrying the mutated RIP were then used to transform a strain that carries both a deletion of genomic RIP and the cyt b mutation A144F (JPJ1/B78). The transformation of this strain with the plasmids carrying the mutated RIP gene (T85A, A90G, A92D, or A92T) restored the respiratory growth competence, whereas the transformation with the WT version of RIP did not restore the respiratory growth. This demonstrated that the changes in the tether region compensated for the deleterious effect of the mutation A144F in the QO domain.A detailed analysis of the effect of A144F mutation and of the suppressor mutations was then performed. The strains used for the analysis were diploid strains homozygous for the nuclear suppressor (RIP, ripT85A, A90G, A92D, or A92T) and carry the WT or the mutant A144F cyt b (Table I). They were constructed as described under “Materials and Methods.”Growth Characteristics—Whereas the mutant A144F was unable to grow on respiratory substrates (ethanol and glycerol) and exhibited a lower growth yield (25%) on fermentable substrates like galactose, the respiration-competent suppressors grew on respiratory substrates with a lower growth rate than the WT (5–6 h versus 3 h and 40 min) but with the same growth yield, showing no uncoupling. Note that the strains harboring the isolated ISP mutations (ISP T85A, A90G, A92D, and A92T) without the original cyt b mutation A144F exhibited a growth rate and yield on respiratory and fermentable substrates similar to the WT (Table I).Cytochrome bc1 Content—A144F showed a decrease of about 30% in the cyt b content and about 50% in the ISP (measured by the presence of the EPR-detectable [2Fe-2S] cluster) indicating that the assembly of its bc1 complex was perturbed (Table II). However, this decrease alone could not account for the respiratory growth deficiency. Some of the suppressor strains exhibited a slight decrease of 25–35% in the content of the [2Fe-2S] cluster (A144F+ISP T85A, A144F+ISP A92D), whereas the strains with the ISP mutations alone showed a WT level of cyt b and ISP. No significant differences were observed for the cyt c + c1 and aa3 content in the strains tested.Table IICytochrome and ISP contents and redox midpoint potentials of the b- and c-type cytochromes of the bc1 complexStrainsCytochrome content[2Fe-2S] cluster contentEm7(±5 mV)c + c1ba + a3c + c1bHbLWT100100100100+270+95-55A144F907011050+285+75-65A144F + F179L105105115100+275+85-70A144F + ISP T85A12012011565ISP T85A11011011095A144F + ISP A90G110110115100ISP A90G120120120100A144F + ISP A92D95908575ISP A92D100100100105A144F + ISP A92T120120ISP A92T909095 Open table in a new tab Redox Potentiometry—In order to test whether the redox potentials of the hemes were affected, potentiometric redox titrations were carried out with the A144F mutant, its intragenic suppressor A144F+F179L, and the WT. No major changes of the midpoint potential were observed both for the hemes bL and bH of the mutant A144F (–65 and +75 mV, respectively) and of the revertant A144F+F179L (–70 and +85 mV, respectively) when compared with the WT (–55 and +95 mV, respectively) (Table II). As expected, no significantly different midpoint potentials were obtained for the cyt c + c1 (between +270 and +285 mV). Therefore the respiratory deficiency of A144F could not be attributed to a modification of the physicochemical properties of the b hemes of cyt b. This was in agreement with the rather long distances of about 12 and 23 Å between Ala-144 and heme bL and bH, respectively (Fig. 1).Respiratory Rates and Activities of the Mitochondrial Complexes—As shown in Table III, A144F exhibited less than 15% of the WT succinate and NADH oxidase activities, which was not enough to support respiratory growth. In the suppressors, these activities increased to 20–60% of WT values. The strains with isolated ISP mutations (T85A, A90G, and A92D) exhibited WT level activities. Similar results were obtained for the succinate and NADH-cyt c reductase activities. In most of the mutants, the percentage of NADH oxidase and NADH-cyt c reductase activities compared with WT was smaller than the percentage of succinate oxidase and succinate-cyt c reductase activities (Table III). Complex II has a lower activity (0.18 μmol of Q reduced min–1·mg–1) than NADH-Q reductase (1.8 μmol of NADH oxidized min–1·mg–1) and is the limiting step between succinate and O2. Therefore, a decreased activity of complex III affects to a greater extent the NADH oxidase and NADH-cyt c reductase activities than the succinate oxidase and succinate cyt c reductase activities (see Refs. 39Brasseur G.

In A144F, the maximum activity of complex II was only 40%, whereas it remained at the WT level in the suppressor A144F+F179L. This decreased activity at the complex II level was observed previously in other cyt b mutants, suggesting a direct interaction between complexes II and III and/or a down-regulation of the expression of complex II in respiratory complex III-deficient mutants (39Brasseur G.

Its activity ranged from 16 to 28% in the suppressors. In the strains harboring the ISP mutations alone (T85A, A90G, and A92T), the maximum complex III activity was significantly higher than in the WT (115–141%, Table III), and no direct correlation was observed between the increased complex III and complex IV activities (Table III).Kinetics of cyt b and cyt c1 Reduction—In order to investigate which step was modified in the overall steady-state electron transfer from ubiquinol to cyt c in the mutant and suppressor strains, we measured the kinetics of reduction of both cyt b and cyt c1 (Fig. 2). According to the Q cycle mechanism (6Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 137-139Google Scholar, 7Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Google Scholar, 8Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

The kinetics provide a global value for the rate of arrival and binding of the substrate to its site and the rate of the various electron transfer steps occurring between this binding site and cyt b or c1.

We examined herein the contribution of the N-terminal subdomain of RB3 to the regulation of MT dynamics. To begin with, we determined the effects of full-length (RB3-f) and short truncated (RB3-s) forms of RB3 on the polymerization of MT in vitro. RB3-s had a deletion of amino acids 1–75 from the N terminus, leaving the so-called stathmin-like domain, consisting of residues 76–217. Although both RB3-f and RB3-s exhibited MT-depolymerizing activity, RB3-f was less effective. The binding affinity for tubulin was also lower in RB3-f. Direct observation of the dynamics of individual MTs using dark field microscopy revealed that RB3-s slowed MT elongation velocity, increased catastrophes, and reduced rescues. This effect is almost identical to that by stathmin/oncoprotein 18. On the other hand, the MT elongation rate increased at lower concentrations of RB3-f. In addition, RB3-f, indicated higher rescue frequency than control as well as the catastrophe in a dose-dependent manner. The functionality of RB3-f indicated that full-length RB3 has not only stathmin-like MT destabilizing activity but also MT-associated protein-like MT stabilizing activity. Possibly, the balance of these activities is altered in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. This interesting regulatory role of the unique N-terminal domain of RB3 in MT dynamics would contribute to the physiological regulation of neuronal morphogenesis.

Their dynamics are regulated, depending on various cellular activities, and a variety of regulatory proteins have been identified so far. Stathmin/oncoprotein 18 family proteins are one of the protein families that make MTs labile (1Mori N. Morii H. J. Neurosci.

It has been demonstrated that one stathmin molecule forms a ternary complex with two tubulin heterodimers, termed the “T2S complex,” via hydrophobic interaction (4Gigant B. Curmi P.A.

Stathmin has also been found to act on GTP-tubulin at MT ends to stimulate the hydrolysis of GTP and to promote the dissociation of GTP-tubulin from the growing ends of MTs (8Segerman B. Larsson N.

Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Based on these results, two models were proposed to account for the stathmin-dependent destabilization of MTs: 1) sequestration of tubulin dimers to prevent their assembly or 2) stimulation of MT catastrophe at MT tips by removing a “GTP cap” that protects the MT from catastrophe. SCG10 family proteins, including SCG10, SCLIP, and RB3, show a high degree of sequence homology to stathmin in their C terminus, termed the “stathmin-like domain.” The various stathmin-like domains including the predicted α-helix display 65–75% amino acid identity with stathmin (7Charbaut E.

Neuroscience. 1994; 60: 907-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The level of SCG10 protein is very low in native PC12 cells but is strongly increased upon the nerve growth factor (NGF)-dependent induction of differentiation (21Di Paolo G. Pellier V. Catsicas M. Antonsson B. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Additionally, PC12 cells that constitutively expressed SCG10 showed a dramatic increase in the tendency to form elongated neurites upon NGF-induced neuronal differentiation, although no neurite outgrowth was observed in the absence of NGF (23Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Di Paolo et al. (21Di Paolo G. Pellier V. Catsicas M. Antonsson B. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed in PC12 cells that a selective blockade of stathmin expression by phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides prevented the differentiation-promoting actions of NGF. Stathmin-depleted PC12 cells produce SCG10 protein normally upon NGF treatment but do not differentiate, suggesting that SCG10 cannot compensate for the function of stathmin (23Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These results have led to the proposal that the functions of stathmin family proteins are considered to be diverged during neural evolution (1Mori N. Morii H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The stable ternary complex with αβ tubulin heterodimers is formed via the stathmin-like domain (4Gigant B. Curmi P.A.

Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but N- and C-terminal flanks of the domain are required for cooperative binding to the tubulin heterodimers (8Segerman B. Larsson N. Holmfeldt P. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35759-35766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggests that the terminal flanks in addition to the binding motifs in contact with tubulin heterodimers play important roles in the regulation of the tubulin-binding and/or MT dynamics. Since the unique N-terminal domain is one of the most important characteristics of SCG10 family proteins, it is possible that it too affects the interaction with tubulin and/or MT dynamics. Although studies of the SCG10 family have provided important information on their stathmin-like actions, the effects of full-length neural SCG10 proteins on the regulation of MTs are still unresolved. In this paper, we investigated the role of the N-terminal domain of RB3, which is the longest N-terminal domain among member of the SCG10 family, to examine whether the unique N-terminal domain of SCG10 proteins is involved in the regulation of MT dynamics. We compared the effects of full-length RB3 and an N-terminally truncated RB3 in vitro using MT assays and found that the full-length RB3 plays a unique role in regulating MT dynamics. DNA Construction, Protein Expression, and Purification—The isolation and manipulation of DNA were performed using standard techniques. Three RB3 gene transcripts have been identified, but since the gene expression of RB3 splicing variants is similar in rat brain and in PC12 cells stimulated with NGF (12Beilharz E.J. Zhukovsky E. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Nikolich K. Goodman L.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9780-9789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used the longest form. Bacterial expression plasmids for the rat full-length RB3 (RB3-f) and an N-terminally truncated mutant (RB3-s, comprising residues 76–217) were constructed by subcloning the cDNAs into the SalI and EcoRI sites of the HAT fusion vector pHAT10 (Clontech) (see Fig. 1). The RB3 derivatives were expressed with a HAT tag at the N terminus and purified from Escherichia coli as follows. The collected cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and 0.3 m NaCl) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then the samples were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 10 °C. After adding TALON metal affinity resins (Clontech) were added to the supernatants, and samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The HAT-RB3-bound resins were washed once with a wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.3 m NaCl) containing different concentrations of urea (8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0 m, in that order) and once with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm imidazole. Finally, protein was eluted from the resins in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm imidazole. The buffer was changed to PM buffer (0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm MgSO4) by centrifugal filtration. Tubulin was isolated from porcine brain by two cycles of polymerization and depolymerizatin and was purified by DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (25Itoh T.J. Hisanaga S. Hosoi T. Kishimoto T. Hotani H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12574-12582Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified tubulin and RB3 recombinant proteins were stored at –80 °C prior to use. Cosedimentation Assay of MTs—The MT destabilizing activity and binding with RB3 derivatives were examined in a co-sedimentation experiment as follows. Tubulin (10 μm) was assembled in PM buffer containing 1 mm GTP in a final volume of 20 μl in the presence of various concentrations of RB3-f or RB3-s (0–10 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C. The polymerized MTs were sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 70,000 rpm for 60 min at 36 °C. The resulting supernatants and pellets were examined with 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, the band signals were analyzed using the program NIH Image. The data were fit by linear or nonlinear regression using the standard binding equation for a macromolecule to obtain the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant. Curve fitting was performed using a Kaleida Graph (Synergy Software). Quantitative Analysis of the Binding between Tubulin and RB3 Derivatives—The binding affinity between RB3 derivatives and tubulin was determined by Scatchard analysis. RB3 derivatives (1 μm) and purified tubulin (0.5–10 μm) were mixed in a final volume of 35 μl in a reaction buffer (0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.9, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm GTP, 5% Tween, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and were incubated for 15 min on ice. RB3-tubulin complexes were captured with 5 μl of TALON metal affinity resin for 30 min at 4 °C. In the present study, we used a low concentration of tubulin heterodimers and an incubation temperature of 4 °C, because these conditions favor the formation of tubulin heterodimers rather than polymers (26Detrich III, H.W. Williams R.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3900-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To confirm the amount of tubulin bound to RB3, the bound proteins were separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE, subjected to silver staining, and analyzed using NIH Image. The data were normalized by subtraction of the nonspecific binding signals. Optical Microscopic Observation of MT Dynamics—To determine the exact effects of RB3s on MT dynamics, individual MTs were monitored using a dark field microscope with several modifications (27Ichihara K. Kitazawa H. Iguchi Y. Hotani H. Itoh T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Ookata K. Hisanaga S. Bulinski J.C. Murofushi H. Aizawa H. Itoh T.J. Hotani H. Okumura E. Tachibana K. Kishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 29Horio T. Hotani H. Nature. 1986; 321: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). First, 24 μm of tubulin was added to allow the polymerization of MTs in PM buffer containing 1 mm GTP at 37 °C for 5 min. An equal volume of prewarmed RB3 recombinant protein solution (0–9 μm) was added to the MT solution, the mixture was transferred to a glass slide, and the slide was immediately sealed. The final tubulin concentration was 12 μm. The optical microscopy was performed at 24 °C. During observations, bovine serum albumin (1.8 mg/ml) was added to prevent the nonspecific attachment of proteins to the glass surface. The dynamic behavior of the MTs was observed using a dark field microscope (ECLIPSE E600; Nikon) with a plan fluor × 100 objective lens and an oil immersion dark field condenser equipped with a 100-watt high pressure mercury lamp as the illumination source. Images were observed with a CCD camera (IR-1000; DAGE-MTI) and were recorded onto a one-half inch SVHS videotape with a Panasonic model AG 3750 videocassette recorder for 40 min. Changes in MT length were measured from the video images incorporated into a Power Mac G4 with the aid of an image capture board (LG3; Scion) in real time using NIH Image. The change in length at each end of a given MT was followed by determining the distance between each end and an arbitrary fixed point on the MT as a function of time. The two ends of MTs indicated the different polymerization rates; the faster growing end is referred to as the plus end and the slower growing end as the minus end (30Allen C. Borisy G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 90: 381-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Whereas the minus ends of MTs are relatively stable (31Baas P.W. Black M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), the plus ends undergo variable phases of assembly and disassembly, also referred to as dynamic instability (32Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2369) Google Scholar). The dynamic instability of minus ends is probably not physiologically relevant, because minus ends in cells are either capped by other proteins (e.g. at centrosomes) or depolymerized when free in the cytoplasm (33Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined only the MT plus ends. Data were shown as means ± S.D., and an unpaired t test was used to make comparisons between the control value and each means with the Macintosh software Statview (SAS Institute Inc.). MT Destabilizing Activity and Tubulin Binding Affinity Were Weakened in Full-length RB3 as Compared with RB3 Stathmin-like Domain—The activity of the recombinantly produced RB3 derivatives in MT assembly and the direct interaction of RB3 with MTs were tested using an MT sedimentation assay. Both recombinant proteins effectively inhibited tubulin assembly in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). This indicated that both proteins have MT destabilization activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, the linear regression analysis of the sedimented MTs and the concentration of RB3 used indicated that RB3-s reduces the concentration of MTs with a slope of –1.95, suggesting that the depolymerization was mainly due to the formation of the T2S complex and its sequestering activity. On the other hand, the slope of RB3-f, –1.37, is smaller than that of RB3-s, and complete inhibition of 10 μm tubulin polymerization required a higher concentration of RB3-f (about 9 μm) as compared with RB3-s (about 5 μm) (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that the MT depolymerization activity is suppressed in RB3-f. Most of the tubulin and RB3 proteins were recovered in the supernatants when the polymerization of MTs was completely inhibited by a sufficient amount of RB3 protein. Neither RB3-f nor RB3-s was sedimented in the absence of tubulin (Fig. 2A), indicating that the “T2S” complex with RB3 or RB3 itself did not form large aggregates in the present conditions. However, both RB3-f and RB3-s were found in pellets at low concentrations when MTs were present (Fig. 2A). This suggests that the sedimented RB3 is bound to MTs. As shown in Fig. 2C, the molar ratios of both RB3 proteins to MT increased as the MT concentration decreased (i.e. as the amount of RB3 used increased) and was higher for RB3-f at all concentrations. Although all unbound RB3 is not practically “free” due to the formation of T2S complex, we further plotted the molar ratio against unbound RB3 concentrations, which was recovered in supernatant, as in Fig. 2D. This plot is not a real Langmuir isothermal plot, but we found apparent saturation of binding for each RB3 construct. From these curves, we obtained apparent equilibrium dissociation constants to MTs for RB3-f (0.43 μm) and for RB3-s (0.81 μm). These values suggest that the interaction between RB3 and MTs is enhanced by the existence of the unique N-terminal domain. It has been shown that the tubulin heterodimer-stathmin affinity in vitro is dependent on pH (10Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25029-25036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 11Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22718-22724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and there is relatively tight interaction between them at pH <7.0 (11Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hence, the tubulin binding activity of the stathmin-like domain may also play an important role in the MT regulatory mechanism of RB3 in the present buffer at pH 6.9. Thus, a Scatchard analysis was performed to determine the affinity between tubulin heterodimers and RB3 derivatives. As shown in Fig. 3, the dissociation constants (Kd values) for RB3-f and RB3-s were 0.57 ± 0.10 and 0.33 ± 0.10 μm, respectively. In previous studies (8Segerman B. Larsson N. Holmfeldt P. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35759-35766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the Scatchard conversion of the binding between tubulin dimers and stathmin was shown to be a complex process with a nonlinear data point distribution typical of two-site positive cooperativity in binding. However, the data point distributed along a linear regression in the present study. This would not be due to the difference in the mode of binding between stathmin and our RB3 constructs. The difference is rather due to a weaker sensitivity for the detection of bound proteins in our experiments than in previous ones using a radioisotope as the protein tracer (8Segerman B. Larsson N. Holmfeldt P. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35759-35766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we emphasize that the Kd values were found to be suppressed in RB3-f as compared with RB3-s in this study. The present results suggested that the affinity of RB3-f for tubulin heterodimers is somehow suppressed, but that for MTs is enhanced as compared with RB3-s. The effects of RB3-f could be attributed to the unique N-terminal domain. Full-length RB3 Stabilizes MTs by Enhancing the Rescue from MT Depolymerization but Simultaneously Promotes MT Catastrophe—We used dark field microscopy to examine whether the N-terminal domain of RB3 alters the characteristic properties of the stathmin-like domain on MT assembly. The number of elongation or shortening phases and the total time observed in the present study were shown in Table I. Four parameters of MT dynamics were assessed: parameter 1, rate of elongation (Fig. 5A); parameter 2, rate of shortening (Fig. 5B); parameter 3, elongation length required for a catastrophe (the transition from elongation to shortening) (Fig. 6A); and parameter 4, shortening length required for a rescue (the transition from shortening to elongation) (Fig. 6B). Elongation or shortening length required for a transition event (catastrophe or rescue) was calculated by dividing the summed length of elongation or shortening phases by the total number of transition events, respectively (28Ookata K. Hisanaga S. Bulinski J.C. Murofushi H. Aizawa H. Itoh T.J. Hotani H. Okumura E. Tachibana K. Kishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These parameters were calculated to express how the level of ease (or difficulty) that ended each phase in the given condition, and the values might be rather comparable with the dynamicity that reflects how dynamic each microtubule is. Parameter 5 (mean length of elongation phase) (Fig. 6C) and parameter 6 (mean length of shortening phase) (Fig. 6D) were also calculated to know the variance of the data. Mean length is the simple average of the lengths of each phase lying between the starting transition event and ending transition event. Since each phase does not always end with the event and since the number of the transition event is smaller than the number of corresponding phases, it is impossible to obtain the S.D. value in obtaining the phase (elongation or shortening) length required for an event (catastrophe or rescue). In addition, the number of phases shown in Fig. 6, C and D, is usually smaller than that shown in Fig. 6, A and B, respectively. Especially, the number of the phase used in the calculation of the mean length of the shortening phase in the presence of 1.5 μm RB3-s (Fig. 6D) is obviously smaller than that of the shortening length required for a rescue (Fig. 6B). Parameter 7 (catastrophe or rescue frequency) was obtained by dividing the total number of catastrophe or rescue events by the total time spent in elongation or shortening phases, respectively (25Itoh T.J. Hisanaga S. Hosoi T. Kishimoto T. Hotani H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12574-12582Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and was shown in Table I. In the present study, a clear difference in the dynamics profiles of MTs was detected between RB3-f and RB3-s, although the MT elongation rate seemed to be low throughout the experiment.Table IEffects of RB3-f and RB3-s on catastrophe and rescue frequency of individual MTsRB3 concentrationNeNcTimeCatastrophe frequencyμmminmin-1Control4333246.30.134RB3-s0.752116138.10.1161.5151365.40.199RB3-f0.752323133.00.1731.53528171.40.16333631147.90.2104.54638176.20.216RB3 concentrationNsNrTimeRescue frequencyμmminmin-1Control383225.51.253RB3-s0.75252015.01.3381.517915.80.569RB3-f0.75231613.51.1831.5322917.41.6693332516.21.5464.5463620.01.799 Open table in a new tab Fig. 6Elongation and shortening length of individual MTs in the presence of RB3 derivatives.

https://openalex.org/W2033732756,"Cycloheximide (CYH) resistance in the yeast Candida maltosa is based on the inducible expression of genes encoding a variant of ribosomal protein L41-Q, with glutamine at position 56 instead of the proline found in normal L41. The promoter of L41-Q2a, one of the L41-Q gene alleles encoding L41-Q, has an element similar to the Gcn4p-responsive element of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In a previous study, this element was shown to be essential for the induction of L41-Q by CYH. In the present study, a C. maltosa GCN4 homolog, C-GCN4, was cloned. It had a long 5′-leader region with three upstream open reading frames. Enhanced expression of the C-GCN4 reporter fusion gene upon the addition of 3-aminotriazole or by mutations in start codons of all three upstream open reading frames indicates that C-GCN4 expression is under translation repression as was seen with GCN4. The C-GCN4-depleted mutant was unable to grow in a nutrient medium containing CYH and did not express L41-Q genes. Recombinant C-Gcn4p bound to the consensus DNA element for Gcn4p, 5′-(G/A)TGACTCAT-3′, located upstream of L41-Q2a. Thus, C-Gcn4p, which likely functions in the general control of amino acid biosynthesis, is essential for the expression of L41-Q genes.

Cycloheximide (CYH) 1The abbreviations used are: CYH, cycloheximide; GCRE, Gcn4p-responsive element; uORF, upstream open reading frame; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole (3-amino-1,4,5-triazole); GST, glutathione S-transferase; YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. is an antibiotic that inhibits the peptide elongation reaction on eukaryotic ribosomes by binding specifically to the 60 S subunit. Numerous yeast species, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are sensitive to low concentrations of CYH. However, some species are by nature resistant to CYH, and their resistance is based on the production of a variant ribosomal protein L41 (1Kawai S. Murao S. Mochizuki M. Shibuya I. Yano K. Takagi M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 254-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CYH-sensitive yeasts have a conventional P-type L41 protein, with proline as amino acid residue 56, whereas CYH-resistant yeasts have a Q-type L41 protein, with glutamine as residue 56 (1Kawai S. Murao S. Mochizuki M. Shibuya I. Yano K. Takagi M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 254-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the latter yeast species are constitutively resistant to CYH, one species of asexual yeast, Candida maltosa, develops resistance only after the addition of CYH to the culture medium (2Takagi M. Kawai K. Takata Y. Tanaka N. Sunairi M. Miyazaki M. Yano K. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1985; 31: 267-275Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that C. maltosa has multiple genes that encode the two types of L41 ribosomal proteins; L41-P genes encode P-type L41 proteins, and L41-Q genes encode Q-type L41 proteins. There are two L41-P genes (L41-P1 and L41-P2) on the partially aneuploid genome of C. maltosa; the former is comprised of two alleles, L41-P1a and L41-P1b. The expression of L41-P genes is constitutive. There are also three L41-Q genes, L41-Q1, L41-Q2, and L41-Q3. L41-Q1 and L41-Q2 are each comprised of two alleles, L41-Q1a and L41-Q1b, and L41-Q2a and L41-Q2b, respectively. The two L41-Q2 alleles and probably L41-Q3 are induced in the presence of CYH and are responsible for CYH resistance in this yeast, whereas the L41-Q1 alleles are not active and are not induced (3Mutoh E. Ohta A. Takagi M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 224: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 4Mutoh E. Mochizuki M. Ohta A. Takagi M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5383-5386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant strains have been constructed in which either the expressible L41-Q genes or all L41-P genes were eliminated. It has been shown that mutants lacking all functional L41-Q alleles are sensitive to CYH, whereas mutants lacking all L41-P genes are constitutively resistant to CYH. Furthermore, ribosomes with only P-type L41 have been shown to be sensitive to CYH in in vitro translation, whereas those with only Q-type L41 were resistant to CYH (3Mutoh E. Ohta A. Takagi M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 224: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The promoter of L41-Q2a, one of the two alleles of CYH-inducible L41-Q2, has a Gcn4p-responsive element (GCRE)-like element that contains an AP-1 consensus sequence (5′-(G/A)TGACTCAT-3′) and an adjacent GT-rich region (5Mutoh E. Takaku H. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Deletion of the GCRE-like element or mutations of its consensus nucleotides abolish CYH-responsive transcription of the L41-Q2a promoter (5Mutoh E. Takaku H. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), indicating the essential role of this element in the induction of Q-type L41 protein. In S. cerevisiae, starvation of single amino acid species results in increased transcription of genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes for amino acids, purine, and aminoacyl tRNAs. This regulatory network is known as the general control of amino acid biosynthesis (6Schurch A. Miozzari J. Hutter R. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wolfner M.

Recently, a regulatory pathway that was homologous to the general control response was identified in mammalian cells, highlighting evolutionary conservation in the organization of the pathway (9Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar). Amino acid starvation results in increased synthesis of the transcription activator, Gcn4p, which binds to specific DNA sequences called GCREs (10Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 11Thireos G. Penn M.D. Greer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These elements are seen in the promoter regions of the above genes and are responsible for their increased expression. GCRE is sometimes accompanied by another element located in its upstream region. Gcn4p belongs to the so-called basic zipper (bZIP)-type regulatory protein family (13Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar, 14Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L.

Genes encoding Gcn4p homologs have been isolated from various fungi and yeast: cpc-1 in Neurospora crassa (17Paluh J.L. Orbach M.J. Legerton T.L. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5448-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Under non-starvation conditions, Gcn4p is produced at low levels due to the negative effects of four upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the leader sequence of GCN4 mRNA (10Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 11Thireos G. Penn M.D. Greer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Under amino acid starvation conditions, the production of Gcn4p is induced by overcoming the inhibitory effect of uORFs through the function of Gcn2p kinase (22Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 23Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell.

Natarajan K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition to this translational regulation, Gcn4p is controlled through various mechanisms that are not yet entirely clear. First, Gcn4p is degraded rapidly in a SCFcdc4 ubiquitin ligase-dependent manner in vivo. This degradation process requires the phosphorylation of specific residues in the Gcn4p activation domain and the cyclin-dependent protein kinases Pho85p and Srb10p. Amino acid starvation or CYH administration somehow represses phosphorylation of Gcn4p and extends its half-life (25Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 27Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28Meimoum A.

Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Deshaies R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1078-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Second, Cpc2p regulates the transcription activation function of Gcn4p in a negative manner via an unknown regulatory mechanism. Cpc2p does not affect Gcn2p-mediated GCN4 expression, the stability of Gcn4p, or the binding ability of Gcn4p to GCRE (25Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 30Hoffmann B. Mosch H.U. Sattlegger E. Barthelmess I.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Braus G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Third, glucose addition or UV irradiation transiently activates Gcn4p through the Ras/cAMP pathway (25Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 31Marbach I. Licht R. Frohnmeyer H. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16944-16951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This activation depends on Gcn2p function but apparently not on its phosphorylating activity for eIF2α. Fourth, GCN4 mRNA levels rise to some extent under amino acid starvation or nitrogen starvation conditions (26Grundmann O. Mosch H.-U. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25661-25671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Albrecht G. Mosch H.U. Hoffmann B. Reusser U. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12696-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although transcriptional control seems to be of only minor importance in the regulation of Gcn4p function (32Albrecht G. Mosch H.U. Hoffmann B. Reusser U. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12696-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Finally, decay of GCN4 mRNA is suppressed by a stabilizer element located between uORF4 and the GCN4 protein-coding region. This stabilization is mediated by a specific binding factor, Pub1, which is one of the major polyadenylated mRNA-binding proteins (33Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Peltz S.W. Cell. 2000; 101: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In C. maltosa, a similar general control system seems to be at work because amino acid starvation induces the expression of a histidine synthetic gene, C-HIS5, which has a GCRE-like element in its promoter. The same starvation conditions also induce the expression of L41-Q2a. Conversely, CYH also induces C-HIS5 (5Mutoh E. Takaku H. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Deletion of the GCRE-like element or mutations in its consensus nucleotide sequence abolish CYH-induced transcription of the L41-Q2a promoter (5Mutoh E. Takaku H. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These observations lead to the assumption that the same Gcn4p-dependent system is involved in both the general control of amino acid biosynthesis and induction of L41-Q2a by CYH. This paper describes the cloning and characterization of C-GCN4, which encodes a Gcn4p homolog in C. maltosa. C-GCN4 mRNA was increased by the addition of CYH or 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), which blocks histidine biosynthesis, indicating the presence of control at the level of transcription or mRNA decay. The expression of C-GCN4 was tightly repressed through the function of the three uORFs in the 5′-leader region of C-GCN4 mRNA, and mutations that inactivated their start codons dramatically suppressed their repressive effect. C-GCN4 was essential for the induction of L41-Q genes by CYH, and recombinant C-Gcn4p bound specifically to the GCRE-like element of the L41-Q2a promoter. These findings indicate the central role of a Candida Gcn4p homolog in the induction of CYH resistance. CMT100 (ade1::ADE1, his5::HIS5, ura3::URA3), CMT101 (ade1, his5::HIS5, ura3::URA3), and CMT102 (ade1::ADE1, his5::HIS5, ura3) are derivatives of C. maltosa strain CHAU1 (ade1, his5, ura3) and were used as the control strain for various transformants. C. maltosa IAM12247 (the wild-type strain) has been described previously (3Mutoh E. Ohta A. Takagi M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 224: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was induced in the strain Escherichia coli DH5 (supE44 hsdR1 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1). The ΔC-GCN4 strain was constructed by sequential two-step gene replacements of the chromosomal C-GCN4 genes using the PvuII fragment of the C-GCN4 deletion cassette (34Ohkuma M. Tanimoto T. Yano K. Takagi M. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Ohkuma M. Zimmer T. Iida T. Schunck W.-H. Ohta A. Takagi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3948-3953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Then the Ura- phenotype was rescued by transformation with a liner XhoI fragment containing the intact C-URA3 gene from vector pURAJ (36Ohkuma M. Muraoka S. Hwang C.W. Ohta A. Takagi M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Isolation of total DNA from yeast cells was described in a previous study (37Ohkuma M. Hikiji T. Tanimoto T. Schunck W.H. Muller H.G. Yano K. Takagi M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 1757-1764PubMed Google Scholar). Transformations were carried out using the lithium-acetate yeast transformation method (38Takagi M. Kawai S. Chang M.C. Shibuya I. Yano K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Correct replacement was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Yeast cells were cultivated in minimal or YPD medium at 30 °C. Appropriate supplements were added at the recommended amounts. Routine precultures were grown overnight, diluted with fresh media, and cultivated to an optical density of ∼0.8 at 660 nm. Then, 50 μg/ml CYH or 10 mm 3-AT for histidine starvation was added to the culture. After an appropriate growth period, cultures were harvested for RNA extraction and measurement of β-galactosidase activity. A part of a GCN4 homolog was amplified from C. maltosa genomic DNA using the following forward and reverse primers, respectively: 5′-CCWTTRCARCCWATHGT-3′ and 5′-TTCNACYTTRTCTTCHAR-TTG-3′ (where R is A or G; W is A or T; Y is C or T; H is A, C, or T; and N is A, C, G, or T). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using a 5′-full RACE core set (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 5′-phosphorylated reverse transcription primer (5′-GACCTTATCTTCCAGTTGGT-3′), A1 (5′-GCAACAGGATCTTCAATACC-3′), S1 (5′-AGCTAAGAATACAGAAGCCG-3′), A2 (5′-ACAACAATTGGCTGCAATGG-3′), and S2 (5′-CAGAAGATCTAGAGCTCGTA-3′) were used to generate an extended C-GCN4 PCR product. The resultant 250-bp PCR product was sequenced, and the 5′-extension of conserved C-GCN4 mRNA was confirmed. Construction of C-GCN4 Deletion Cassettes—A 2.7-kb EcoRV fragment containing C-GCN4 was inserted into the SmaI site of vector pUC18 to obtain pUC-CGCN4. As a result of this, the entire C-GCN4 open reading frame was removed by digestion with AflII and Bst1107I. The residual fragment was blunt-ended and was combined with a blunt-ended SalI fragment containing C-ADE1 (39Kawai S. Hikiji T. Murao S. Takagi M. Yano K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) to obtain pUC-CGCN41 or with a blunt-ended SalI fragment containing C-HIS5 (40Hikiji T. Ohkuma M. Takagi M. Yano K. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to obtain pUC-CGCN45. Construction of pPL-CGCN4 with a C-GCN4-LAC4 Fusion Gene—A DNA fragment containing C-CGN4 promoter and its 5′-coding region was amplified using primers 5′-ACGCGTCGACAGGTCCTTATGTATAGA-3′ (primer 1) (SalI site is underlined) and 5′-AGTATACAGCAGGAGTAGTAGC-3′ (primer 2). The amplified fragment was digested with SalI and inserted between the SalI and SmaI sites of pPL1 (41Ohkuma M. Masuda Y. Park S.M. Ohtomo R. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid pPL-CGCN4 carries C-ADE1, CEN, ARS, and the C-GCN4-LAC4 fusion in which LAC4 is fused in-frame to the ninth codon of C-GCN4 (42Masuda Y. Park S.M. Ohkuma M. Ohta A. Takagi M. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The correct nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequencing. Construction of C-GCN4-LAC4 Derivatives with Mutations at uORF Start Codons—First, six DNA fragments (uORF11, uORF12, uORF21, uORF22, uORF31, and uORF32) were amplified from pUC-CGCN4 using the following six sets of primers (restriction sites are underlined): uORF11, primer 1 and 5′-GACTAGTGGATATATCTAATAATACG-3′ (primer 3); uORF12, 5′-GCTCTAGATCTGCTTAAATTATTTTATTA-3′ (primer 4) and primer 2; uORF21, primer 1 and 5′-CCCAATTGTTTAAGCAATAATATAAGGAG-3′ (primer 5); uORF22, 5′-CCCAATTGAAATAGATTACTTATTATCCC-3′ (primer 6) and primer 2; uORF31, primer 1 and 5′-GACTAGTGGACGGGGATAATAA-3′ (primer 7); and uORF32, 5′-GACTAGTACGTTTGTTATCCTAATACC-3′ (primer 8) and primer 2. Next, uORF11 and uORF12 were digested with SpeI and XbaI, respectively, and were then ligated. A DNA fragment (m-uORF1) was amplified from the ligation products using the primers 1 and 2, digested with SalI, and then inserted between the SalI and SmaI sites of pPL1 (41Ohkuma M. Masuda Y. Park S.M. Ohtomo R. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to give a plasmid pPL-CGCN4m-uORF1. This is identical to pPL-CGCN4 except for base substitutions (AGA) in the start codon of uORF1. uORF21 and uORF22 were digested with MunI, and uORF31 and uORF32 were digested with SpeI. These two sets of fragments were also ligated and treated in the same way as the case of m-uORF1 to produce PCR products m-uORF2 and m-uORF3, respectively. These DNA fragments were introduced between SalI and SmaI sites of pPL1 (41Ohkuma M. Masuda Y. Park S.M. Ohtomo R. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) as described above to give pPL-CGCN4m-uORF2 and pPL-CGCN4m-uORF3, respectively. The uORF2 start codon changes to CAA, and the uORF3 start codon changes to AGT. A DNA fragment (uORF23) was amplified from m-uORF3 as a template using primers 6 and 2. uORF21 and uORF23 were digested with MunI and ligated. From their ligation products, another DNA fragment (uORF13) was amplified using primers 4 and 2. SpeI-digested uORF11 and XbaI-digested uORF13 were ligated, and then, from their ligation products, a DNA fragment (m-uORF1,2,3) was amplified using primers 1 and 2. The fragment m-uORF1,2,3 was digested with SalI and inserted between the SalI and SmaI sites of pPL1 (39Kawai S. Hikiji T. Murao S. Takagi M. Yano K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) to give pPL-CGCN4m-uORF1,2,3. The start codons of uORF1, uORF2, and uORF3 on m-uORF1,2,3 changed to AGA, CAA, and AGT, respectively. Construction of pGEX-CGCN4 with a GST::C-GCN4 Fusion Gene— The wild-type C-GCN4 coding region was amplified from pUC-CGCN4 using the following primers: 5′-CGGGATCCATGTCTGCTACTACTCCTGC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTTAAAAGCTTATACCATGACTG-3′ (BamHI and EcoRI sites, respectively, are underlined). The resultant PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and then inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The correct nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequencing. Deletion Mutants of the L41-Q2a Promoter Region—All the deletion mutants of the L41-Q2a promoter region have been described previously (5Mutoh E. Takaku H. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using the Applied Biosystems sequencing system model 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer extension analysis was performed as described previously (43Ohtsubo Y. Delawary M. Kimbara K. Takagi M. Ohta A. Nagata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36146-36154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using the IRD41-labeled primer 5′-CAAAACAAAGCGCGAGGATC-3′. Total RNA of C. maltosa was isolated according to the protocol described by Schmitt et al. (44Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA from each sample was separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred onto Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe prepared from an 800-bp PCR-generated C-GCN4 fragment, a 500-bp PCR-generated LAC4 fragment, or a 1.1-kb HindIII fragment of L41-Q2a. The L41-Q2a probe was shown to cross-hybridize to L41-Q2b and L41-Q3 transcripts under the study conditions (data not shown). The 32P-labeled 500-bp SalI-EcoRI fragment of ACT1 was used as an internal standard. Signals were quantified using a FLA-3000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). β-Galactosidase activities of permeabilized yeast cells were determined using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Yeast cells were cultivated in minimal medium, and β-galactosidase activities after the addition of CYH or 3-AT were assayed as described previously (41Ohkuma M. Masuda Y. Park S.M. Ohtomo R. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). E. coli DH5 harboring pGEX-CGCN4 was grown to OD600 0.7 in 1 liter of Superbroth (3.2% Bacto™ peptone, 2% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) at 25 °C and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 25 °C. Cells were collected, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A), and disintegrated using a French pressure cell press (SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana, IL). Broken cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was incubated with 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 12 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 40 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.8% Triton X-100, washed with 10 ml of lysis buffer, and then eluted with lysis buffer containing 25 mm glutathione. Complex formation between the purified recombinant C-Gcn4p and 32P-labeled DNA fragments was performed in 15 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and immediately loaded onto a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 50:1. It was then subjected to electrophoresis at 120 V in 1× Tris/borate/EDTA as a running buffer. Three synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with 32P and used in the binding assays. The first sequence, 5′-GGAGATACTTTTGGGGGGAAATTTATGAGTCATACGTTT-3′, contained the consensus AP-1/GCRE and the adjacent GT-rich regions; the second, 5′-AAATTTATGAGTCATACGTTT-3′, contained the consensus AP-1/GCRE region; and the third, 5′-GGAGATACTTTTGGGGGGAAATTT-3′, contained the GT-rich region. Isolation of the C-GCN4 Gene—Based on the conserved region of S. cerevisiae Gcn4p and its homologs in various eukaryotic microorganisms, PCR primers were designed and used to amplify a part of the GCN4 homolog gene from the genomic DNA of C. maltosa. The resultant amplified DNA fragment (130 bp) was used to obtain an extended fragment of 250 bp by 5′-RACE-PCR. Using this fragment as a probe, a GCN4 homolog gene was isolated from the C. maltosa genomic library and was named C-GCN4. C-GCN4 encodes a protein of 314 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular weight of 34,038. The deduced amino acid sequence displays strong similarities to S. cerevisiae Gcn4p (32% identity, 52% similarity), N. crassa CPC1 (33% identity, 53% similarity), A. niger CpcA (35% identity, 52% similarity), A. nidulans CPCA (35% identity, 55% similarity), and C. parasitica CPC1 (33% identity, 50% similarity). C-Gcn4p shows particularly high similarity in the regions corresponding to basic DNA binding and the leucine zipper-based dimerization domains of S. cerevisiae Gcn4p and other members of the b-ZIP family of transcription factors (11Thireos G.

Primer extension analysis revealed two transcriptional start sites located 466 and 461 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon (Fig. 1A). Within the long 5′-leader sequence, C-GCN4 mRNA has three uORFs (Fig. 1B). uORFs in the 5′-leader region have also been reported in the genes encoding Gcn4p and the above orthologs. Four uORFs in the GCN4 mRNA of S. cerevisiae are involved in translational regulation of gene expression (22Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol.
