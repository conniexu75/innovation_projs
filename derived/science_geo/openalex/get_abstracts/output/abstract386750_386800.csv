https://openalex.org/W2075460992,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to study protein motions at an atomic level of detail, but they have been limited to time scales shorter than those of many biologically critical conformational changes. We examined two fundamental processes in protein dynamics--protein folding and conformational change within the folded state--by means of extremely long all-atom MD simulations conducted on a special-purpose machine. Equilibrium simulations of a WW protein domain captured multiple folding and unfolding events that consistently follow a well-defined folding pathway; separate simulations of the protein's constituent substructures shed light on possible determinants of this pathway. A 1-millisecond simulation of the folded protein BPTI reveals a small number of structurally distinct conformational states whose reversible interconversion is slower than local relaxations within those states by a factor of more than 1000."

In a mouse model of sterile liver inflammation, McDonald et al. (p. 362 ) used dynamic in vivo imaging to visualize the innate immune response, which is dominated by neutrophils. Neutrophils were rapidly recruited to the site of inflammation through intravascular channels. Adenosine triphosphate generated from necrotic cells at the injury site and the Nlrp3 inflammasome were required for neutrophils to exit the circulation into the vascular endothelium, where they used integrins to adhere. A luminal chemokine gradient guided integrin-dependent, intravascular migration toward the site of injury. Finally, formyl peptides provided a signal to override the chemokine gradient and draw neutrophils into the site of injury."
https://openalex.org/W1971084572,"Apoptotic cells release 'find-me' signals at the earliest stages of death to recruit phagocytes. The nucleotides ATP and UTP represent one class of find-me signals, but their mechanism of release is not known. Here, we identify the plasma membrane channel pannexin 1 (PANX1) as a mediator of find-me signal/nucleotide release from apoptotic cells. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated knockdown of PANX1 led to decreased nucleotide release and monocyte recruitment by apoptotic cells. Conversely, PANX1 overexpression enhanced nucleotide release from apoptotic cells and phagocyte recruitment. Patch-clamp recordings showed that PANX1 was basally inactive, and that induction of PANX1 currents occurred only during apoptosis. Mechanistically, PANX1 itself was a target of effector caspases (caspases 3 and 7), and a specific caspase-cleavage site within PANX1 was essential for PANX1 function during apoptosis. Expression of truncated PANX1 (at the putative caspase cleavage site) resulted in a constitutively open channel. PANX1 was also important for the 'selective' plasma membrane permeability of early apoptotic cells to specific dyes. Collectively, these data identify PANX1 as a plasma membrane channel mediating the regulated release of find-me signals and selective plasma membrane permeability during apoptosis, and a new mechanism of PANX1 activation by caspases."

Here, we identify a Myc-centered regulatory network in ES cells by combining protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction studies and show that Myc interacts with the NuA4 complex, a regulator of ES cell identity. In combination with regulatory network information, we define three ES cell modules (Core, Polycomb, and Myc) and show that the modules are functionally separable, illustrating that the overall ES cell transcription program is composed of distinct units. With these modules as an analytical tool, we have reassessed the hypothesis linking an ES cell signature with cancer or cancer stem cells. We find that the Myc module, independent of the Core module, is active in various cancers and predicts cancer outcome. The apparent similarity of cancer and ES cell signatures reflects, in large part, the pervasive nature of Myc regulatory networks."
https://openalex.org/W1967586250,"Arresting Meiosis In mammals, meiotic maturation of oocytes must be coordinated precisely with ovulation to produce a developmentally competent egg at the right time for fertilization. How is coordination achieved? Follicular granulosa cells prevent precocious resumption of meiosis in oocytes, maintaining meiotic arrest until the pre-ovulatory hormone surge. Granulosa cells produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which is delivered to oocytes and arrests meiotic progression by inhibiting oocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate degradation. How cGMP production is regulated is unclear. Now, Zhang et al. (p. 366 ) report that NPPC (natriuretic peptide precursor type C), produced by mural granulosa cells, and its receptor NPR2, a guanylyl cyclase expressed by cumulus cells, together promote cGMP production by cumulus cells and are thus essential for maintaining meiotic arrest in mouse oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1982928030,"Turning Up the Heat The physical effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide on Earth's energy budget—that is, its “greenhouse effect”—has been understood for more than 100 years, but its role in climate warming is still not universally accepted. Lacis et al. (p. 356 ) conducted a set of idealized climate model experiments in which various greenhouse gases were added to or subtracted from the atmosphere in order to illustrate their roles in controlling the temperature of the air. The findings clearly show that carbon dioxide exerts the most control on Earth's climate, and that its abundance determines how much water vapor the atmosphere contains, even though the radiative effect of the water vapor is greater than that of carbon dioxide itself."
https://openalex.org/W2060413224,"Packing the Core The packing and arrangement of atoms in Earth's solid inner core can dictate processes such as core growth and rotation. Seismology and modeling suggest the inner core is composed primarily of iron, but the structure is less clear due to anisotropic splitting of seismic waves. Tateno et al. (p. 359 ) performed static compression experiments on pure iron at the extremely high pressures and temperatures found in the inner core and saw that iron prefers a hexagonal close-packed structure, as opposed to cubic structures. The results help to explain the observed seismic anisotropy, and also suggest that individual iron crystals in the core may prefer orienting themselves with their long crystallographic axes parallel to Earth's rotation axis."

(p. 349 ; see the Perspective by Peterca and Percec ) demonstrate the formation of a new ordered phase in a diblock copolymer and a tetrablock copolymer formed from frustrated self-assembled spherical microdomains. Remarkably, this structure contains tetragonal unit cells with 30 spheres per lattice site and is related to dodecagonal quasicrystals. This structure was first described by Frank and Kasper as a sigma phase 50 years ago and is seen in some metal alloys."

(p. 812 , published online 14 October) studied the conductance of high-quality suspended bilayer graphene samples. They used an applied perpendicular electric field to induce transitions between the different broken-symmetry states that appear at low carrier densities and deduced their order parameters. These states appeared in both the absence of a magnetic field, as well as in the presence of a symmetry-breaking magnetic field. They also showed that, even in absence of both an applied magnetic or electric field, the bilayer exhibits an energy gap, which indicates that electron-electron interactions contribute to the band structure."
https://openalex.org/W2051680216,"Hot Enough to See Over the last decade, detection of fluorescence from individual molecules has allowed for increasingly detailed probing of biochemical reaction mechanisms. The key advantage of fluorescence detection is the absence of background; the signal appears as a glowing point in a void. However, not all molecules fluoresce, and so alternative detection methods are needed. Gaiduk et al. (p. 353 ) now show that a photothermal detection scheme can resolve absorption events by individual molecular dyes that exhibit poor fluorescence efficiency. The technique relies on each molecule's release of heat to the surrounding solvent after light absorption, an energy dissipation mechanism that is enhanced as fluorescence efficiency declines. The solvent heating alters the local refractive index just enough to scatter a portion of a probe beam backwards, revealing the absorption."

As well as mechanisms that detect and degrade messages with premature stop codons, no-go decay (NGD) results in the degradation of mRNA with inhibitory secondary structure or chemical damage. Shoemaker et al. (p. 369 ) show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the protein complex formed between Dom34 and Hbs1 is involved in NGD. The complex acts as a translational “reset button,” recognizing failed translation events and initiating an abortive program that results in the destruction of the stalled mRNA."

Using data from three different x-ray observatories, Rea et al. (p. 944 , published online 14 October) show that a previously known magnetar has a magnetic field that is much smaller than those of other magnetars. A strong magnetic field is thus not a necessary requirement for a neutron star to show magnetar-like behavior, implying that this population is wider than was previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2079665723,"Tubulin assembles into microtubule polymers that have distinct plus and minus ends. Most microtubule plus ends in living cells are dynamic; the transitions between growth and shrinkage are regulated by assembly-promoting and destabilizing proteins. In contrast, minus ends are generally not dynamic, suggesting their stabilization by some unknown protein. Here, we have identified Patronin (also known as ssp4) as a protein that stabilizes microtubule minus ends in Drosophila S2 cells. In the absence of Patronin, minus ends lose subunits through the actions of the Kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerase, leading to a sparse interphase microtubule array and short, disorganized mitotic spindles. In vitro, the selective binding of purified Patronin to microtubule minus ends is sufficient to protect them against Kinesin-13-induced depolymerization. We propose that Patronin caps and stabilizes microtubule minus ends, an activity that serves a critical role in the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2078768877,"The size of the nucleus varies among different cell types, species, and disease states, but mechanisms of nuclear size regulation are poorly understood. We investigated nuclear scaling in the pseudotetraploid frog Xenopus laevis and its smaller diploid relative Xenopus tropicalis, which contains smaller cells and nuclei. Nuclear scaling was recapitulated in vitro using egg extracts, demonstrating that titratable cytoplasmic factors determine nuclear size to a greater extent than DNA content. Nuclear import rates correlated with nuclear size, and varying the concentrations of two transport factors, importin α and Ntf2, was sufficient to account for nuclear scaling between the two species. Both factors modulated lamin B3 import, with importin α increasing overall import rates and Ntf2 reducing import based on cargo size. Importin α also contributes to nuclear size changes during early X. laevis development. Thus, nuclear transport mechanisms are physiological regulators of both interspecies and developmental nuclear scaling."
https://openalex.org/W1984987626,"Transposons are mobile DNA segments that can disrupt gene function by inserting in or near genes. Here, we show that insertional mutagenesis by the PiggyBac transposon can be used for cancer gene discovery in mice. PiggyBac transposition in genetically engineered transposon-transposase mice induced cancers whose type (hematopoietic versus solid) and latency were dependent on the regulatory elements introduced into transposons. Analysis of 63 hematopoietic tumors revealed that PiggyBac is capable of genome-wide mutagenesis. The PiggyBac screen uncovered many cancer genes not identified in previous retroviral or Sleeping Beauty transposon screens, including Spic, which encodes a PU.1-related transcription factor, and Hdac7, a histone deacetylase gene. PiggyBac and Sleeping Beauty have different integration preferences. To maximize the utility of the tool, we engineered 21 mouse lines to be compatible with both transposon systems in constitutive, tissue- or temporal-specific mutagenesis. Mice with different transposon types, copy numbers, and chromosomal locations support wide applicability."

Although somatic aging has been studied in both worms and humans, mechanisms regulating reproductive aging are not yet understood.

Although progressive loss of ovarian follicles leads to menopause between the ages of 45 and 55, the risk of infertility, birth defects, and miscarriage increase a decade earlier, likely because of age-related declines in oocyte quality (te Velde and Pearson, 2002te Velde E.R.

Although aged mammalian oocytes exhibit increased errors in fertilization, chromosome segregation, and cleavage divisions (Goud et al., 1999Goud P. Goud A. Van Oostveldt P. Van der Elst J. Dhont M.

Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful model for aging studies because of its short life span and the conservation of longevity pathways from C. elegans to humans (Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, Suh et al., 2008Suh Y. Atzmon G. Cho M.-O.

USA. 2008; 105: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Recently, C. elegans has also been developed as a model of reproductive aging (Andux and Ellis, 2008Andux S. Ellis R.E. Apoptosis maintains oocyte quality in aging Caenorhabditis elegans females.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000295Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Hughes et al., 2007Hughes S.E. Evason K. Xiong C.

Ashraf J. Murphy C.T. TGF-beta Sma/Mab signaling mutations uncouple reproductive aging from somatic aging.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These studies established that (1) C. elegans reproductive aging is independent of sperm contribution; (2) simply reducing ovulation rate or progeny production do not extend reproductive span; and (3) reproductive aging is usage independent (i.e., independent of the magnitude and timing of oocyte use). That is, in worms as in humans, simply delaying the reproductive schedule does not delay reproductive aging. One argument against using C. elegans as a model of human reproductive aging is that oocytes are continually produced in worms, whereas humans' total oocyte supply is produced at birth. However, both human and C. elegans females reproduce for about one-third to one-half of their lives, and thus undergo significant reproductive aging on proportional time scales, implying that genetic mechanisms may link reproduction to longevity in both organisms (Cant and Johnstone, 2008Cant M.A. Johnstone R.A.

Shaw W.M. Ashraf J. Murphy C.T. TGF-beta Sma/Mab signaling mutations uncouple reproductive aging from somatic aging.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both human and C. elegans oocytes are cell-cycle arrested at meiotic prophase I, release from arrest is coordinated with oocyte maturation in both, and the mechanisms underlying oocyte maturation are highly conserved between the two organisms (Greenstein, 2005Greenstein D. Control of oocyte meiotic maturation and fertilization.WormBook. 2005; Dec 28: 1-12Google Scholar, Mehlmann, 2005Mehlmann L.M. Stops and starts in mammalian oocytes: recent advances in understanding the regulation of meiotic arrest and oocyte maturation.Reproduction. 2005; 130: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Most importantly, human reproductive aging occurs a decade prior to the exhaustion of the oocyte supply, suggesting that oocyte quality, rather than quantity, is the limiting factor for successful reproduction with age. Thus, the critical question that we address in this study is whether worms' reproduction is similarly limited by oocyte quality, and if so, by what mechanisms. Several long-lived C. elegans mutants, including the Insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutant daf-2, delay reproductive aging (Huang et al., 2004Huang C. Xiong C. Kornfeld K.

We recently found that mutants of the TGF-β Sma/Mab pathway also significantly extend reproductive span (Luo et al., 2009Luo S. Shaw W.M. Ashraf J. Murphy C.T. TGF-beta Sma/Mab signaling mutations uncouple reproductive aging from somatic aging.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas mutants in the TGF-β Dauer pathway extend life span (Shaw et al., 2007Shaw W.M.

Biol. 2007; 17: 1635-1645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) without greatly extending reproductive span (Luo et al., 2009Luo S. Shaw W.M. Ashraf J. Murphy C.T. TGF-beta Sma/Mab signaling mutations uncouple reproductive aging from somatic aging.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The TGF-β Sma/Mab pathway, which is highly conserved from worms to humans, consists of extracellular ligands (DBL-1), type I (SMA-6) and type II (DAF-4) receptors, R-Smads (SMA-2 and SMA-3), a co-Smad (SMA-4), and a transcription co-factor (SMA-9) (Massagué, 2000Massagué J. How cells read TGF-[beta] signals.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, Savage-Dunn, 2005Savage-Dunn C. TGF-β signaling.WormBook. 2005; Sep 9: 1-12Google Scholar). Notably, Sma/Mab regulation of reproductive span is genetically independent of Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and Dietary Restriction (Luo et al., 2009Luo S. Shaw W.M. Ashraf J. Murphy C.T. TGF-beta Sma/Mab signaling mutations uncouple reproductive aging from somatic aging.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here we show that C. elegans oocytes, like human oocytes, degrade functionally and morphologically with age and that reduction of TGF-β Sma/Mab signaling and IIS delays reproductive aging by maintaining oocyte and germline quality. Although the TGF-β Sma/Mab pathway acts autonomously in the hypodermis to regulate body size (Wang et al., 2002Wang J. Tokarz R. Savage-Dunn C. The expression of TGF-beta signal transducers in the hypodermis regulates body size in C. elegans.Development. 2002; 129: 4989-4998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), surprisingly, we find that both insulin and TGF-β Sma/Mab signaling regulate oocyte and distal germline quality maintenance nonautonomously. TGF-β regulates reproductive aging separately from the developmental regulation of growth, both temporally and transcriptionally. We find that TGF-β oocyte transcriptional targets that are required for C. elegans embryonic and germline integrity maintenance also change with age in mammalian oocytes. The conserved nature of these signaling pathways suggests that the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of C. elegans reproductive capacity with age may also influence reproductive capacity decline in higher organisms. Wild-type C. elegans reproduction declines with age, but reduced Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) delays reproductive cessation (Hughes et al., 2007Hughes S.E. Evason K. Xiong C. Kornfeld K. Genetic and pharmacological factors that influence reproductive aging in nematodes.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e25Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We recently found that reduced TGF-β Sma/Mab signaling also significantly extends reproductive span in a manner that is independent of insulin signaling, caloric restriction, sperm contribution, and ovulation rate (Luo et al., 2009Luo S. Shaw W.M. Ashraf J. Murphy C.T. TGF-beta Sma/Mab signaling mutations uncouple reproductive aging from somatic aging.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying normal reproductive aging and its delay in insulin and TGF-β signaling mutants, we systematically investigated each component of the reproductive system, from fertilized embryos through the distal germline (Figure 1A ). To examine fertilized embryo quality, we determined embryonic lethality rates. Compared to age-matched daf-2 and sma-2 animals, older wild-type animals produced significantly more embryos that fail to hatch, though they all produced more unhatched embryos with age (Figures 1B and 1E and Figure S1A available online) and that are susceptible to damage by bleaching, a test of eggshell integrity (Figures S1C and S1D). Thus, the reproductive span extension exhibited by daf-2 and sma-2 mutants is at least partly a manifestation of increased embryo integrity late in reproduction. Chromosomal abnormalities, in particular aneuploidies, are a major cause of mammalian embryonic developmental defects (Magli et al., 2007Magli M.C. Gianaroli L. Ferraretti A.P. Lappi M. Ruberti A. Farfalli V. Embryo morphology and development are dependent on the chromosomal complement.Fertil.

Chromosomal abnormalities and embryo development in recurrent miscarriage couples.Hum. Reprod. 2003; 18: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and nondisjunction rates also increase with age in Drosophila (Tokunaga, 1970Tokunaga C. The effects of low temperature and aging on nondisjunction in Drosophila.Genetics. 1970; 65: 75-94PubMed Google Scholar). Increased chromosomal abnormalities, particularly autosome loss, could contribute to C. elegans embryonic lethality. Meiotic X chromosome nondisjunction produces males (Hodgkin et al., 1979Hodgkin J. Horvitz H.R. Brenner S. Nondisjunction mutants of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1979; 91: 67-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in combination with embryonic lethality, provides a simple measure of chromosomal loss (Saito et al., 2009Saito T.T. Youds J.L. Boulton S.J. Colaiacovo M.P. Caenorhabditis elegans HIM-18/SLX-4 interacts with SLX-1 and XPF-1 and maintains genomic integrity in the germline by processing recombination intermediates.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000735Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the fraction of male progeny produced by wild-type mothers increased 16-fold from day 1 to day 5 (Figure 1C). By contrast, the rate of male production by daf-2 and sma-2 mutants was significantly lower (Figure 1C and Figure S1B). To directly test disjunction fidelity, we counted DAPI-stained bodies (Saito et al., 2009Saito T.T. Youds J.L. Boulton S.J. Colaiacovo M.P. Caenorhabditis elegans HIM-18/SLX-4 interacts with SLX-1 and XPF-1 and maintains genomic integrity in the germline by processing recombination intermediates.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000735Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in oocytes of spermless (fem-1) animals. We found that the number of oocytes with the normal number of stained bodies (six bivalents) decreased significantly with age in fem-1, but insignificantly in sma-2;fem-1 and daf-2;fem-1 animals (Figure 1D and Figure S1E), suggesting an increased frequency of chromosomal segregation errors in wild-type oocytes with age. Therefore, worms with reduced Insulin/IGF-1 and TGF-β Sma/Mab signaling better maintain oocyte chromosome segregation fidelity with age. Oocyte quality decline is also a cause of human age-related infertility (Goud et al., 1999Goud P. Goud A. Van Oostveldt P. Van der Elst J. Dhont M. Fertilization abnormalities and pronucleus size asynchrony after intracytoplasmic sperm injection are related to oocyte postmaturity.Fertil. Steril. 1999; 72: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test fertilizability, we mated hermaphrodites with young adult (Day 1 or 2) wild-type males and counted the number of fertilized embryos and unfertilized oocytes produced each day (Figure 1E and Figure S1F), excluding mothers that stopped producing cross-progeny before reproductive cessation. (While fertilized embryos are ovoid with a distinct eggshell, unfertilized oocytes are fuzzy and round, as shown in Figure 1E). Aging wild-type animals produced a significant number of unfertilized oocytes with age, whereas daf-2 and sma-2 mutants produced almost exclusively successfully fertilized embryos (Figure 1E and Figure S1F). Although daf-2 and sma-2 mutants produce fewer total progeny, such usage-dependent mechanisms as total progeny number, early progeny production, and ovulation rate have been previously eliminated as contributing factors in reproductive aging (Andux and Ellis, 2008Andux S.

To ensure that sperm is not limiting in our mated assays, we examined oocytes of mated worms for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) foci, which form in sperm-depleted oocytes (Jud et al., 2007Jud M. Razelun J. Bickel J. Czerwinski M. Schisa J. Conservation of large foci formation in arrested oocytes of Caenorhabditis nematodes.Dev. Genes Evol. 2007; 217: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); the Day 8 nonreproductive mated worms do not form RNP foci (Figure S1G). This suggests that sufficient sperm are available throughout the reproductive period in our mating experiments, and the unfertilized oocytes that the wild-type worms produce in old age are likely due to lower oocyte quality. Mutations in both the TGF-β Sma/Mab and IIS pathways delay such decline, rendering the oocytes fertilizable longer. To determine whether IIS and TGF-β Sma/Mab signaling regulate oocyte morphology maintenance, we examined wild-type and mutant oocytes with age. On Day 1 of adulthood, wild-type oocytes are large and closely packed with their neighboring oocytes (Figure 1F). sma-2 mutants have fewer oocytes aligned in the gonad because of their short length, but the morphology of the oocytes in both the daf-2 and sma-2 mutants is similar to wild-type in early adulthood. On Day 8, when mated wild-type animals have nearly ceased reproduction, their oocytes have visibly degraded: some become much smaller, as previously reported (Andux and Ellis, 2008Andux S. Ellis R.E. Apoptosis maintains oocyte quality in aging Caenorhabditis elegans females.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000295Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); some lose contact with their neighbors, resulting in cavities; and others fuse into large clusters packed in the uterus (Figure 1F and Figures S1H–S1K). The defects were independent of levamisole paralysis treatment used for microscopy (Figures S1L and S1M and Figures S2A and S2B ). To test whether these defects are morphological predictors of reproductive capacity, we compared reproductive and postreproductive wild-type animals; oocytes from the postreproductive animals were significantly more degraded in terms of oocyte size, cavities, and cluster formation (Figure 1G). By contrast, oocytes in aged daf-2 and sma-2 animals were still young-looking, with significantly fewer morphological defects than age-matched wild-type oocytes (Figure 1F and 1H and Figures S1N–S1S). Thus, reduced TGF-β Sma/Mab and IIS activity both improve oocyte morphology maintenance. Together, our data suggest that oocyte quality, as defined by chromosome segregation fidelity, fertilizability, and morphology, declines with age in C. elegans, and that reduced TGF-β Sma/Mab and IIS signaling delay this decline. The distal germline undergoes significant morphological decline with age, but IIS mutations significantly slow this deterioration (Garigan et al., 2002Garigan D. Hsu A.-L. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C. Genetic analysis of tissue aging in Caenorhabditis elegans: a role for heat-shock factor and bacterial proliferation.Genetics. 2002; 161: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures 2A and 2B and Figures S2C–S2F). We scored the appearance of cavities, graininess, and cellularization, the major morphological markers of germline aging (Garigan et al., 2002Garigan D. Hsu A.-L. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C. Genetic analysis of tissue aging in Caenorhabditis elegans: a role for heat-shock factor and bacterial proliferation.Genetics. 2002; 161: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and found that sma-2 mutations also significantly slow germline deterioration (Figures 2A and 2B and Figures S2G and S2H). Although these may be independent effects of the pathways, oocyte and distal germline morphology characteristics in the same population of wild-type worms are correlated (Figure S2J). The distal germline contains proliferating germline stem cells (GSCs) and their mitotic descendents. The number of DAPI-stained germ cell nuclei in this zone declines significantly with age in wild-type animals (Figure 2C and Figure S2I), but declines less in daf-2 and sma-2 animals (Figure 2C and Figure S2I), possibly because of better maintenance of proliferative ability. Together, our data suggest that both IIS and TGF-β Sma/Mab signaling may regulate the maintenance of distal germline proliferation and germline quality, as well as oocyte quality. Prior to cellularization into oocytes, germ cell nuclei undergo programmed cell death (Gumienny et al., 1999Gumienny T.L. Lambie E. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Hengartner M.O. Genetic control of programmed cell death in the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite germline.Development. 1999; 126: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This “physiological germ cell apoptosis” has been proposed to be an important factor in maintaining oocyte quality via resource reallocation (Andux and Ellis, 2008Andux S. Ellis R.E. Apoptosis maintains oocyte quality in aging Caenorhabditis elegans females.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000295Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We found that sma-2 and daf-2 mutants have higher levels of physiological apoptosis than wild-type, but wild-type levels decreased insignificantly with age (Figure S2K). C. elegans' germline also undergoes apoptosis as a response to DNA damage from ionizing radiation (Gartner et al., 2000Gartner A. Milstein S. Ahmed S. Hodgkin J. Hengartner M.O. A conserved checkpoint pathway mediates DNA damage–induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in C. elegans.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We examined animals after γ-irradiation and found that DNA damage–induced apoptosis declined significantly with age in wild-type animals, but the rates in older TGF-β and IIS mutants were not significantly different from wild-type (Figure S2L). Although neither Insulin/IGF-1 nor TGF-β signaling appears to regulate this process, the significant decrease in irradiation-induced apoptosis with age likely contributes to reproductive aging in general. A different aspect of the DNA damage response is improved both by reduced IIS and TGF-β signaling: the number of viable progeny produced after ionizing radiation treatment increased significantly in daf-2 and sma-2 mutants compared to wild-type (Figure 2D). The proportion of arrested larvae is also slightly increased in the mutants (Figure S2M), suggesting that even damaged animals are more developmentally competent than the wild-type progeny. Thus, although the rate of DNA-damage induced apoptosis is not increased, sma-2 and daf-2 germ cells may better repair damaged DNA or be better protected against genotoxic stress, which in turn may be partially responsible for slowed reproductive aging. TGF-β Sma/Mab signals cell-autonomously in the hypodermis to regulate body growth (Wang et al., 2002Wang J. Tokarz R. Savage-Dunn C. The expression of TGF-beta signal transducers in the hypodermis regulates body size in C. elegans.Development. 2002; 129: 4989-4998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the cell autonomy of TGF-β Sma/Mab signaling in the regulation of reproductive aging, we performed mosaic analyses. Hypodermal expression of the TGF-β Sma/Mab signal transducer SMA-3, which forms a transcriptional complex with SMA-2, is necessary and sufficient for normal body length (Wang et al., 2002Wang J. Tokarz R. Savage-Dunn C. The expression of TGF-beta signal transducers in the hypodermis regulates body size in C. elegans.Development. 2002; 129: 4989-4998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like sma-2 mutants, sma-3 mutants extend reproductive span (Luo et al., 2009Luo S. Shaw W.M. Ashraf J. Murphy C.T. TGF-beta Sma/Mab signaling mutations uncouple reproductive aging from somatic aging.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and maintain oocyte and germline morphology longer with age (Figure 3C and 3D ). If reproductive aging is dependent on cell-autonomous TGF-β Sma/Mab signaling in the germline, loss of the sma-3 transgene in the germline alone should recapitulate sma-3 reproductive span extension. Alternatively, if reproductive aging is dependent on somatic (nonautonomous) TGF-β signaling, somatic sma-3 expression should be sufficient to suppress the long reproductive span of sma-3. We screened a synchronized population of sma-3(wk30);qcEx26[sma-3 gDNA;sur-5::gfp] transgenic animals (Wang et al., 2002Wang J. Tokarz R. Savage-Dunn C. The expression of TGF-beta signal transducers in the hypodermis regulates body size in C. elegans.Development. 2002; 129: 4989-4998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), selecting worms expressing GFP in most somatic tissues, including hypodermis, but without germline fluorescence (Figure S3A–S3C ) (“germline silent” animals). Because the sma-3 transcript could still be present but undetectable, we also selected somatically fluorescent animals that produced no fluorescent progeny, indicating that they had completely lost the transgenic array in the germline (“germline lost”). As previously reported, somatic sma-3 activity rescued body length (Figure 3A). Surprisingly, both the germline-silent and germline-lost animals had wild-type–like reproductive spans (Figure 3B), indicating that somatic sma-3 expression is sufficient to rescue reproductive span regulation. We also found that the sma-3 germline-silent mosaic animals reduced ovulation rate and progeny number, but have a normal reproductive span (Figure 3B and Figures S3D and S3E), underscoring our previous finding that low ovulation rates and progeny numbers do not extend reproductive span (Luo et al., 2009Luo S. Shaw W.M. Ashraf J. Murphy C.T. TGF-beta Sma/Mab signaling mutations uncouple reproductive aging from somatic aging.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Additionally, the morphology of day 8 oocytes and distal germlines of somatic sma-3 animals were more similar to wild-type than to sma-3 (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, TGF-β signaling regulates reproductive aging nonautonomously, signaling from somatic tissues to the germline to maintain quality.Figure S3TGF-β Sma/Mab Signaling Regulates Reproductive Aging Nonautonomously in Hypodermis, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–C) Confirmation of sma-3 expression patterns under Nikon Eclipse 90i (40x).

Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) recode genomic information by the site-selective deamination of adenosine. Here, we report the solution structure of the ADAR2 double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) bound to a stem-loop pre-mRNA encoding the R/G editing site of GluR-2. The structure provides a molecular basis for how dsRBMs recognize the shape, and also more surprisingly, the sequence of the dsRNA. The unexpected direct readout of the RNA primary sequence by dsRBMs is achieved via the minor groove of the dsRNA and this recognition is critical for both editing and binding affinity at the R/G site of GluR-2. More generally, our findings suggest a solution to the sequence-specific paradox faced by many dsRBM-containing proteins that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression."

Studies in a variety of ecosystems suggest that FCL is determined by energy supply, environmental stability, and/or ecosystem size, but the nature of the relationship between environmental stability and FCL, and the mechanism linking ecosystem size to FCL, remain unclear. Here we show that FCL increases with drainage area and decreases with hydrologic variability and intermittency across 36 North American rivers. Our analysis further suggests that hydrologic variability is the mechanism underlying the correlation between ecosystem size and FCL in rivers. Ecosystem size lengthens river food chains by integrating and attenuating discharge variation through stream networks, thereby enhancing environmental stability in larger river systems."
https://openalex.org/W2132960194,"The identity of the putative G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the non-genomic effects of androgens is unknown. We present in vitro and in vivo evidence that the orphan GPRC6A receptor, a widely expressed calcium and amino acid sensing GPCR, transduces the non-genomic effects of testosterone and other steroids. Overexpression of GPRC6A imparts the ability of extracellular testosterone to illicit a rapid, non-genomic signaling response in HEK-293 cells lacking the androgen receptor. Conversely, testosterone-stimulated rapid signaling and phosphorylation of ERK is attenuated in bone marrow stromal cells derived from GPRC6A(-/-) mice and in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells after siRNA-mediated knockdown of GPRC6A. Compared with wild-type controls, GPRC6A(-/-) null mice exhibit significantly less ERK activation and Egr-1 expression in both bone marrow and testis in response to pharmacological doses of testosterone in vivo. In addition, testosterone administration results in suppression of luteinizing hormone in wild-type male mice, but paradoxically stimulates serum luteinizing hormone levels in GPRC6A(-/-) null mice. These results suggest that GPRC6A is functionally important in regulating non-genomic effects of androgens in multiple tissues."

The cryo-EM structure of actin filament reveals intermolecular interactions Mg2+ and phosphate ions (Pi) play an important role in stabilizing the filament The bending of the Pro-rich loop triggers the activation of the ATPase activity A cavity in the catalytic site plays a role in releasing hydrolyzed γ-phosphates The actin-filament system is required in almost all cytoplasmic processes, including cell adhesion, motility, cellular signaling, intracellular trafficking, and cytokinesis. Although stable actin filaments (F-actin) are necessary during muscle contraction, the active turnover of filaments is required in many cell functions. Actin has two major domains separated by a nucleotide-binding cleft (Kabsch et al., 1990Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Atomic structure of the actin:DNase I complex.Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). The outer domain is divided into subdomains 1 and 2 and the inner domain into subdomains 3 and 4. All of the subdomains interact with the bound nucleotide. ATP is hydrolyzed at the rate of 1/3.3 s−1 following the elongation of filaments at the growing end of filaments (Blanchoin and Pollard, 2002Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Hydrolysis of ATP by polymerized actin depends on the bound divalent cation but not profilin.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas the phosphate release is 100 times slower (Carlier and Pantaloni, 1986Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Direct evidence for ADP-Pi-F-actin as the major intermediate in ATP-actin polymerization. Rate of dissociation of Pi from actin filaments.Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7789-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As a result, newly polymerized filaments consist of stable ADP-Pi actin (abbreviated as F-ADP-Pi), whereas the older filaments contain mainly ADP actin (F-ADP), which disassembles more rapidly (Carlier and Pantaloni, 1986Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Direct evidence for ADP-Pi-F-actin as the major intermediate in ATP-actin polymerization. Rate of dissociation of Pi from actin filaments.Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7789-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, inorganic phosphate (Pi) binds to F-actin and reduces the critical concentration for polymerization (Rickard and Sheterline, 1986Rickard J.E. Sheterline P. Cytoplasmic concentrations of inorganic phosphate affect the critical concentration for assembly of actin in the presence of cytochalasin D or ADP.J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Fujiwara et al., 2007Fujiwara I. Vavylonis D. Pollard T.D. Polymerization kinetics of ADP- and ADP-Pi-actin determined by fluorescence microscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 8827-8832Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Actin dynamics also depends on the identity of the bound divalent cation, physiologically Mg2+, associated with the bound nucleotide (Carlier et al., 1986Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. Fluorescence measurements of the binding of cations to high-affinity and low-affinity sites on ATP-G-actin.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10778-10784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a vast amount of biochemical data has been accumulated, the quest for a definitive and detailed molecular mechanism of the polymerization of monomeric actin (G-actin) to filamentous actin (F-actin) has been hampered by the inherent flexibility of actin filament. The flexibility has not allowed an atomic structure of F-actin to be determined. More than 50 atomic structures of G-actin bound with ATP or ADP have been determined since 1990 (Kabsch et al., 1990Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Atomic structure of the actin:DNase I complex.Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar), but F-actin has been visualized to relatively moderate resolution either by three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction from electron micrographs (Belmont et al., 1999Belmont L.D. Orlova A. Drubin D.G. Egelman E.H. A change in actin conformation associated with filament instability after Pi release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or modeling based on X-ray fiber diagrams (Holmes et al., 1990Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Atomic model of the actin filament.Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, Lorenz et al., 1993Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. Refinement of the F-actin model against X-ray fiber diffraction data by the use of a directed mutation algorithm.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The inherent flexibility of actin filaments hampers determination of atomic structure. Recently, a new model of F-actin based on improved X-ray fiber diffraction analysis was reported (Oda et al., 2009Oda T. Iwasa M. Aihara T. Maéda Y. Narita A. The nature of the globular- to fibrous-actin transition.Nature. 2009; 457: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Oda et al. proposed that outer-domain movement upon assembly flattens the actin molecule in the polymer, similar to the case of the bacterial actin homolog MreB (van den Ent et al., 2001van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Prokaryotic origin of the actin cytoskeleton.Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), and that the DNase I binding loop (DNase I loop) adopts an open loop conformation. However, the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis and its coupling with actin assembly remains poorly understood. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) data in which single-particle analysis has been applied to short and relatively straight stretches of filaments, with Pi added in the millimolar range (similar to the intracellular Pi concentration), to further minimize filament flexibility (Nonomura et al., 1975Nonomura Y. Katayama E. Ebashi S. Effect of phosphates on the structure of the actin filament.J. Biochem. 1975; 78: 1101-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The quality of the cryo-EM images was further refined as described in the Experimental Procedures. The resolution of the final reconstruction was estimated to be ∼5 Å (Fourier shell correlation [FSC] of 0.143 at 4.7 Å, a criterion according to Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003Rosenthal P.B. Henderson R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 721-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) or ∼8 Å (FSC of 0.5 at 7.8 Å, a traditional criterion), and some of the α-helical backbones and large side chains can be directly observed. This indicates that the data quality was sufficient to visualize the structural changes upon polymerization and allowed us to build a quasi-atomic model of F-actin (F-ADP+Pi). Putative Mg2+-binding sites and Pi-binding sites of F-actin, which play an important role in actin assembly, were identified in the EM map, and the proline (Pro)-rich loop (residues 108–112) was observed to adopt a more bent configuration that would trigger a phosphate-releasing pathway. Crystal structures of G-actin with mutations in this loop, in which the ATPase activity was increased or decreased, further revealed the region required for Pi release (the so-called back-door region; Wriggers and Schulten, 1999Wriggers W. Schulten K. Investigating a back door mechanism of actin phosphate release by steered molecular dynamics.Proteins. 1999; 35: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the atomic details of the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. The combined structural information sheds new light on the coupling mechanism of ATP hydrolysis and F-actin assembly. The 3D cryo-EM structure was reconstructed from segments containing 26 actin molecules (Figure 1B ). Approximately 8000 actin molecules from zero energy-loss cryo-EM images of actin filaments in the presence of phosphate (Figure 1A) contributed to the final EM map (Figure 1 and Figure S1 available online). A quasi-atomic model (Figures 1B and 1D) was constructed by refining the initial F-actin model consisting of 26 G-ADP actin molecules (Rould et al., 2006Rould M.A. Wan Q. Joel P.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Crystal structures of expressed non-polymerizable monomeric actin in the ADP and ATP states.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31909-31919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to obtain a good fit into the EM density map (see Figure S1, Movie S1, Movie S2, and Figure 1E for FSC and figure-of-merit [FOM] plots). The resolution of the structure of F-actin appeared to be nonuniform depending on the regions (Figure 1E). In the region where three actin molecules interact within the filament, the quality of EM map was better (Figure 1E) and the backbone structure of α helices 5 and 6 (h5, residues 183–196; h6, residues 207–216) and the Thr-rich loop (residues 197–204) could be clearly resolved, allowing the assignment of some large side chains such as Lys191, Tyr198, and Arg206 (Figures 1C and 1D). Although no β structure could be directly visualized, most α helices and loops defined in Figure 2C could be assigned. The N-terminal segment (residues 1–5), h0 (residues 41–48) in the middle of DNase I loop, and h7 (mobile helix: residues 226–230) were less clearly resolved but still allowed main-chain placement except for the h0 segment, which is disordered.

(F–H) The EM densities for the DNase I loop (F), the helix 7 and the Ser-rich loop (residues 231–237) in subdomain 4 (G), and the N-terminal region (H). The main chains could be traced except for the middle part (residues 41–48) of the DNase I loop. The B-factor correction was not applied to these EM maps.

The crystal structure of uncomplexed actin in the ADP state.Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) was superimposed onto that of actin filament (F-actin) (green). In the F-actin structure (F-ADP+Pi), the outer domain is rotated by ∼16° relative to the inner domain. The rotation angle was determined using DynDom (Hayward and Berendsen, 1998Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.C.

The bound ADP is shown in ball and stick format. (B) The enlarged frontal view of the hydrophobic cleft in F-actin (green) and G-actin (gray). DNase I loop (not shown) fits in the rear half of hydrophobic cleft. The front half of hydrophobic cleft remains empty and widens. The double-headed arrows show that the distance betweenTyr143 and Leu346 is wider in F-actin compared with that in G-actin. The arrow indicates the hinge point of the outer-domain rotation. (C) Root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) per residue between the molecules of F-actin and G-actin. For the calculation, each of the inner and outer domains was superimposed onto that of G-actin independently. The structure within each domain is essentially the same as that of G-actin. The conformational changes occur mainly in DNase I loop, Pro-rich loop, Thr-rich loop, mobile helix h7, and Ser-rich loop, all of which are involved in the intermolecular interfaces. (D) Actin polymerization assay. Actin mutants (2.3 μM) were incubated at 25°C, ultracentrifuged, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The data represent mean values with standard errors of the actin pellets (n = 4). In the F-actin structure, the relation between the two major actin domains is different from that in G-actin. The outer domain is found rotated in a swing-door manner by ∼16° relative to the inner domain (Figure 2A). The pivoting point, Asp154 next to P loop 2, is located near the bound nucleotide, with two hinges: Gln137-Ala138 and Lys336-Tyr337 (Figures 2A and 2C). The axis of the rotation was oriented by ∼40° relative to the filament helix axis (Figure 2A) and not vertical to the helix axis (Oda et al., 2009Oda T. Iwasa M. Aihara T. Maéda Y. Narita A. The nature of the globular- to fibrous-actin transition.Nature. 2009; 457: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) (Figure S2). The outer-domain rotation enables the DNase I loop to fit in the rear half of the hydrophobic cleft (Figure 1F) so that it could reach Leu110, which can be clearly assigned in the EM map, of the actin molecule on the minus-end side (Figure 1C and Movie S1). As a result of the outer-domain rotation (Figure 2A), the front half of the hydrophobic cleft is widened, making the side chain of Tyr143 more solvent exposed and increasing the distance between Tyr143 and Leu346 on the hydrophobic helix (h12) (Figure 2B). The importance of the front half of the hydrophobic cleft for polymerization is further highlighted by the fact that the Dictyostelium actin with Tyr143Phe mutation polymerizes poorly. The Tyr143Ile mutation, however, has only a small inhibitory effect on assembly (Figure 2D). This is consistent with the fact that the corresponding residue of the bacterial actin homolog MreB is Ile (van den Ent et al., 2001van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Prokaryotic origin of the actin cytoskeleton.Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The front half of the hydrophobic cleft is also a primary site for G-actin- and/or F-actin-binding proteins, which could regulate actin assembly by promoting or blocking the widening of the hydrophobic cleft. Indeed, small marine toxins such as kabirimide C and jaspisamide A (Klenchin et al., 2003Klenchin V.A. Allingham J.S. King R. Tanaka J. Marriott G. Rayment I. Trisoxazole macrolide toxins mimic the binding of actin-capping proteins to actin.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which bind to the front half of the hydrophobic cleft and sever actin filament, are sterically compatible with our F-actin structure. This may partially account for the inhibitory effect of modification of Cys374 with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) on polymerizability (Otterbein et al., 2001Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. The crystal structure of uncomplexed actin in the ADP state.Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Accompanying the domain rotation, the main-chain atoms shift more than 4.8 Å mainly in the loop regions (Figure 2C), which facilitates intermolecular interactions. This results in a buried surface area between three actin molecules of up to 7646 Å2, which is a substantial increase compared to 2998 Å2 for the crystal structure of G-ADP actin docked into the EM map without remodeling. At the interface of the three actins within the filament (Figures 1C and 1D and Figure 3A ), the Thr-rich loop (containing Thr202 and Thr203) was remarkably different from that in G-actin (shown in gray in Figure 3A). Furthermore, the N-terminal part of h6 was shifted compared to that in G-actin (shown in gray in Figure 3A and Figure S1A) and possibly stabilized by a putative salt bridge of Glu205 with Arg290 of the upper molecule and the hydrophobic interaction of Ala204 and Ile208 with Ile287 of the upper molecule. The disruption of h6 is observed in the crystal structure of the actin-DNase I complex (Kabsch et al., 1990Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Atomic structure of the actin:DNase I complex.Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). Local reordering of the N-terminal part of h6 could provide a common binding site for actin-binding proteins, including actin itself, and could also help bind a magnesium ion (site 1 in Figure 3A) and two phosphate ions (Pi1 and Pi2, Figure 1D). This feature of h6 is supported by Dictyostelium mutants Val287Asp or Arg290Glu, which both polymerized poorly (Figure 3G), emphasizing the importance of Ile287 (Val287 in Dictyostelium actin) and Arg290 in the vertical interaction. In addition, these mutants exhibit more disperse distribution when fused to GFP in Dictyostelium cells, with the double mutant displaying a more prominent phenotype (Figure 3F). Both of two Pi-binding loops, P loop 1 (residues 13–16) and P loop 2 (residues 156–159), could be assigned (Figure 4B ). They surrounded the densities that correspond to α- and β-phosphates of the bound nucleotide, with no evidence for any γ-phosphate density. The region, where the γ-phosphate is located in the ATP form, is occupied by bulk solvent (Figure 4B), indicating that F-actin has bound ADP in the ATPase site (Figure 4B). Similar to the majority of crystal structures of G-actin with ATP or ADP, the nucleotide-binding cleft (Nolen and Pollard, 2007Nolen B.J. Pollard T.D.

However, the P loop 1 encircles a low-density region (a bubble in the EM map; Figure S4A ), suggesting that two strands, s1 (residues 8–11) and s2 (residues 16–18), might be dynamically deformed. This could allow accommodation of the outer-domain rotation. Consistent with this, NMR spectroscopy showed that residues 1–22, which include P loop 1, are mobile even in an F-actin state (Heintz et al., 1996Heintz D. Kany H. Kalbitzer H.R.

Compared with G-ATP actin, Glu72 on the sensor loop moves upwards by 2 Å and closer to Arg183. This enables a putative salt bridge between Glu72 and Arg183, which stabilize F-actin, as Arg183 is also associated with two phosphate ions. Actin is known to have several binding sites for cations and phosphates (Rickard and Sheterline, 1986Rickard J.E. Sheterline P.

https://openalex.org/W2022036412,"Reduction of brain amyloid-β (Aβ) has been proposed as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer disease (AD), and microglial Aβ phagocytosis is noted as an Aβ clearance system in brains. Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved for symptomatic treatment of AD. Galantamine also acts as an allosterically potentiating ligand (APL) for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). APL-binding site is located close to but distinct from that for acetylcholine on nAChRs, and FK1 antibody specifically binds to the APL-binding site without interfering with the acetylcholine-binding site. We found that in human AD brain, microglia accumulated on Aβ deposits and expressed α7 nAChRs including the APL-binding site recognized with FK1 antibody. Treatment of rat microglia with galantamine significantly enhanced microglial Aβ phagocytosis, and acetylcholine competitive antagonists as well as FK1 antibody inhibited the enhancement. Thus, the galantamine-enhanced microglial Aβ phagocytosis required the combined actions of an acetylcholine competitive agonist and the APL for nAChRs. Indeed, depletion of choline, an acetylcholine-competitive α7 nAChR agonist, from the culture medium impeded the enhancement. Similarly, Ca(2+) depletion or inhibition of the calmodulin-dependent pathways for the actin reorganization abolished the enhancement. These results suggest that galantamine sensitizes microglial α7 nAChRs to choline and induces Ca(2+) influx into microglia. The Ca(2+)-induced intracellular signaling cascades may then stimulate Aβ phagocytosis through the actin reorganization. We further demonstrated that galantamine treatment facilitated Aβ clearance in brains of rodent AD models. In conclusion, we propose a further advantage of galantamine in clinical AD treatment and microglial nAChRs as a new therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2050879491,"LIN28 (a homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans lin-28 gene) is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein and a master regulator controlling the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. Together with OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, LIN28 can reprogram somatic cells, producing induced pluripotent stem cells. Expression of LIN28 is highly restricted to embryonic stem cells and developing tissues. In human tumors, LIN28 is up-regulated and functions as an oncogene promoting malignant transformation and tumor progression. However, the mechanisms of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of LIN28 are still largely unknown. To examine microRNAs (miRNAs) that repress LIN28 expression, a combined in silico prediction and miRNA library screening approach was used in the present study. Four miRNAs directly regulating LIN28 (let-7, mir-125, mir-9, and mir-30) were initially identified by this approach and further validated by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and a LIN28 3′-UTR reporter assay. We found that expression levels of these four miRNAs were clustered together and inversely correlated with LIN28 expression during embryonic stem cell differentiation. In addition, the expression of these miRNAs was remarkably lower in LIN28-positive tumor cells compared with LIN28-negative tumor cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that these miRNAs were able to regulate the expression and activity of let-7, mediated by LIN28. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that miRNAs let-7, mir-125, mir-9, and mir-30 directly repress LIN28 expression in embryonic stem and cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W1971485679,"Signaling pathways are controlled by a vast array of posttranslational mechanisms. By contrast, little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate the expression of their core components. We conducted an RNAi screen in Drosophila for factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling and identified the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) as a key element of this pathway. The EJC binds the exon-exon junctions of mRNAs and thus far, has been linked exclusively to postsplicing events. Here, we report that the EJC is required for proper splicing of mapk transcripts by a mechanism that apparently controls exon definition. Moreover, whole transcriptome and RT-PCR analyses of EJC-depleted cells revealed that the splicing of long intron-containing genes, which includes mapk, is sensitive to EJC activity. These results identify a role for the EJC in the splicing of a subset of transcripts and suggest that RAS/MAPK signaling depends on the regulation of MAPK levels by the EJC."

Humans have three CDC50 genes: CDC50A, CDC50B, and CDC50C (18Katoh Y. Katoh M. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 12: 939-943PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length transcripts of human CDC50A and CDC50B are found in multiple tissues. CDC50C is a testis-specific expressed gene, but no full-length transcripts have been found in hominoids (19Osada N. Hashimoto K. Hirai M. Kusuda J. Gene. 2007; 392: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fourteen P4-ATPase genes have been identified in the human genome (20Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J.

Genome Res. 1998; 8: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This suggests that CDC50 proteins may associate with more than one P4-ATPase or that there are P4-ATPases that operate on their own. At present, it is not clear why the human genome harbors so many P4-ATPases. It is unknown if these proteins have specialized functions at the cellular level or if P4-ATPase family members perform similar functions but are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. endoplasmic reticulum vesicular stomatitis virus G transferrin receptor.

Next to liver, ATP8B1 is among others highly expressed in the intestine and cochlear hair cells. Impaired ATP8B1 function in these organs can lead to diarrhea and impaired hearing (24Lykavieris P. van Mil S. Cresteil D. Fabre M. Hadchouel M. Klomp L. Bernard O. Jacquemin E. J.

ATP8B1 showed a functional interaction with CDC50A, and it was subsequently suggested that CDC50A might play a role in ATP8B1-related disease. P4-ATPases are divided into subclasses based on sequence homology (21Halleck M.S. Pradhan D. Blackman C. Berkes C. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A.

Other prominent members of this class are ATP8A1 (previously called ATPase II), which is the first cloned mammalian flippase (28Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and ATP8B3, a testis-specific member important for male fertility in mice (29Gong E.Y. Park E. Lee H.J. Lee K.

Little is known about the other class 1 P4-ATPases, especially in humans. In this study, we determined the specificity of class 1 P4-ATPase interactions with CDC50 proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functional consequences of these interactions on cellular location and plasma membrane abundance of both protein classes. pcDNA3.1-CDC50A-V5, pcDNA3-ATP8A2-Rho1D4, and pCB7-VSV-ATP8B1 were described previously (1Coleman J.A.

The open reading frame of human ATP8B1 was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 with a C-terminal HA tag. Open reading frames of human CDC50B, ATP8B1, ATP8B2, and ATP8B4 (German Resource Center for Genome Research, Berlin, Germany; and Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan) subcloned in pcDNA3.1 with a C-terminal HA tag were generously provided by Dr. J. Holthuis (Utrecht University). Human testis and hippocampus RNAs (Invitrogen) were treated with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and used to clone ATP8B3 and ATP8A1, respectively. ATP8B3 was cloned into pCB7 with an N-terminal vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) tag, and ATP8A1 was cloned into the pEBB vector (32Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) with a C-terminal HA tag. The SNAP open reading frame was cloned at the C terminus of CDC50A. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Human bone osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transiently transfected with polyethyleneimine. After 2 days, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and P4-ATPase proteins were visualized using rabbit anti-VSV-G (for ATP8B1 and ATP8B3), mouse anti-Rho1D4 (for ATP8A2), mouse anti-HA (for ATP8B2, ATP8B4, and ATP8A1) or rabbit anti-ATP8A1 antibody (supplemental Fig. S1). Co-labeling of ER marker proteins was performed either with rabbit anti-calreticulin antibody (for ATP8B2, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2; Alexis Biochemicals) or mouse anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antibody (for ATP8B1 and ATP8B3; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Co-labeling with the Golgi markers mouse anti-p58 antibody (Sigma) and rabbit anti-GM130 antibody (Abcam) was performed for ATP8A1. The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568, goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488, and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488, and goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 (Invitrogen) and donkey anti-mouse Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). CDC50 proteins were visualized using FITC-conjugated mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Images were acquired using an LSM 710 Meta confocal microscope equipped with a ×63/1.40-numerical aperture Plan-Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) by sequential excitation at 488 and 561 nm. U2OS cells were transfected using polyethyleneimine. Two days after transfection, proteins at the cell surface were biotinylated and isolated as described (31van der Velden L.M. Stapelbroek J.M. Krieger E. van den Berghe P.V. Berger R. Verhulst P.M. Holthuis J.C. Houwen R.H. Klomp L.W. van de Graaf S.F. Hepatology. 2010; 51: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). P4-ATPase and CDC50 proteins in cell lysates and in the NeutrAvidin precipitates were analyzed by immunoblot analyses using rabbit anti-VSV-G (Abcam), mouse anti-HA (PD7 clone, Sigma), mouse anti-Rho1D4 (Sigma), and mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen) antibodies. Incubation of the blots with mouse anti-transferrin receptor antibody (Invitrogen) was routinely performed as a loading control. Mouse anti-HSP70 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) was used to probe for cytosolic proteins and was consistently absent from the NeutrAvidin precipitate. The secondary antibodies used for detection were goat anti-mouse HRP (Pierce) and goat anti-rabbit HRP (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as described previously (31van der Velden L.M. Stapelbroek J.M. Krieger E. van den Berghe P.V. Berger R. Verhulst P.M. Holthuis J.C. Houwen R.H. Klomp L.W. van de Graaf S.F. Hepatology. 2010; 51: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using rabbit anti-V5 antibody (Sigma) to detect CDC50 proteins and rabbit anti-VSV-G (for ATP8B3) or HRP-conjugated mouse anti-HA (for ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B4, and ATP8A1; Sigma). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of ATP8A2 and CDC50 proteins was performed by incubating lysates with rabbit anti-V5 antibody immobilized on protein A-agarose beads, followed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-V5 and mouse anti-Rho1D4 antibodies. U2OS cells were transiently transfected with CDC50A or cotransfected with CDC50A and a P4-ATPase. Two days after transfection, total cell lysates were treated with endoglycosidase H (Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands) or N-glycosidase F (Westburg) or left untreated and subjected to immunoblotting. The interaction of CDC50A and CDC50B with ATP8B1 was investigated by co-immunoprecipitations using transiently transfected U2OS cells. Upon coexpression of ATP8B1 and CDC50A or CDC50B, a specific anti-V5 tag signal was detected as broad bands at ∼50 kDa in cell lysates (Fig. 1A, left panels) and V5 precipitates (right panels). ATP8B1 efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with both CDC50A and CDC50B. No signal was detected in the precipitated fraction using lysates of non-transfected cells or cells transfected with ATP8B1 only. Similarly, the interactions of other human class 1 P4-ATPases with CDC50A and CDC50B were determined. ATP8B2 was detected as a single band at ∼140 kDa, in line with its predicted molecular mass (Fig. 1B, left panels). ATP8B2 co-precipitated with both CDC50A and CDC50B (Fig. 1B, right panels). ATP8B3 was well detected at ∼145 kDa (Fig. 1c, left panels) and did not co-precipitate with CDC50A or CDC50B (right panels). Finally, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2 associated specifically with CDC50A (Fig. 1, D–F). In all cases, the P4-ATPase signal in immunoprecipitates was not detected when V5-tagged CDC50A or CDC50B was not coexpressed, indicating the specificity of the procedure. From the lysate blots of the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we noticed that the P4-ATPase signal in the total lysate was dependent on CDC50 expression. Coexpression of CDC50A increased the total cellular expression level of ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2 (Fig. 1, A, B, and D–F; see Fig. 3, A, B, and D–F, and Fig. 4) compared with the expression levels of these P4-ATPases when transfected alone. Cotransfection of CDC50B increased the expression levels of only ATP8B1 (Fig. 1A), whereas none of the other P4-ATPases showed this effect (Fig. 1, B–F). In contrast, cotransfection of CDC50 proteins had no effect on the total cellular expression of ATP8B3 (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 4CDC50B coexpression prevents ATP8B2 translocation to the plasma membrane. U2OS cells were transiently transfected with ATP8B2 only or cotransfected with CDC50A-SNAP or with CDC50A-SNAP and CDC50B-V5. Surface-resident ATP8B2 was quantified by biotinylation, followed by immunoblotting. CDC50B coexpression resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in ATP8B2 plasma membrane localization, despite the presence of CDC50A. NT, non-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated the effect of CDC50A or CDC50B coexpression on the subcellular localization of class 1 P4-ATPases by confocal microscopy. In the absence of CDC50A protein coexpression, ATP8B1, ATP8B3, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2 localized to the ER in transiently transfected U2OS cells, illustrated by the significant colocalization with the ER marker proteins calreticulin and protein-disulfide isomerase. ATP8B2 and ATP8B4 showed plasma membrane localization and additional minor colocalization with ER markers (Fig. 2, A–F, upper panels). Upon coexpression of CDC50A or CDC50B, ATP8B1 localization shifted to the plasma membrane, where it colocalized with the CDC50 proteins (Fig. 2A). Such dramatic translocation upon coexpression of CDC50A or CDC50B was less obvious for ATP8B4, which already resided at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2D). Significant colocalization with CDC50A was observed for ATP8B2 and ATP8B4 at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, B and D). ATP8B2 resided predominantly in the ER in the presence of CDC50B (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2). Upon coexpression with CDC50A, ATP8A1 and ATP8A2 translocated to the Golgi complex and plasma membrane (Fig. 2, E–H, and supplemental Fig. S2). CDC50A colocalized with ATP8A1 and ATP8A2 at the Golgi complex and plasma membrane. In contrast, upon CDC50B coexpression, ATP8A1 and ATP8A2 remained in the ER (Fig. 2, E and F, and supplemental Fig. S2, E and F). No effect of CDC50 coexpression was seen on the subcellular localization of ATP8B3, which resided in all cases at the ER (Fig. 2C). The P4-ATPase translocation to the plasma membrane upon coexpression of CDC50 proteins was investigated by cell-surface biotinylation. Coexpression of CDC50A strongly enhanced the cell-surface expression of ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2 (Fig. 3, A, B, and D–F). ATP8B3 was undetectable in the biotinylated fraction in both the presence and absence of CDC50 proteins (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, ATP8B1 was the only class 1 P4-ATPase with markedly enhanced plasma membrane expression when CDC50B was coexpressed (Fig. 3A). Although this P4-ATPase co-precipitated with CDC50B, ATP8B2 abundance at the plasma membrane was unaltered or even decreased upon CDC50B coexpression. Expression of CDC50B even reversed the stimulatory effect of CDC50A on ATP8B2 plasma membrane abundance in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). CDC50A was detected in the biotinylated fraction in the presence of ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2, whereas CDC50B was detected mainly in this fraction upon coexpression of ATP8B1. Neither CDC50A nor CDC50B was present in the biotinylated fraction upon coexpression of ATP8B3. The transferrin receptor (TfR) signal was similar under all conditions, assuring equal loading. Omission of sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (no biotin) during the cell-surface labeling precluded binding of P4-ATPases, CDC50A, and CDC50B to the NeutrAvidin beads, and no signal for these proteins was detected in non-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A–F). Furthermore, we could not detect cytosolic HSP90 in the NeutrAvidin precipitates, demonstrating the specificity of the assay for cell-surface proteins (data not shown). FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 show that CDC50 proteins are determinants of the expression and localization of several of the P4-ATPases under investigation in this study. We also investigated whether the expression and localization of CDC50A and CDC50B were dependent on the coexpression of a P4-ATPase. CDC50A transiently transfected in U2OS cells localized at the ER. CDC50B resided in the ER and showed partial plasma membrane localization (Fig. 5A). CDC50A translocated from the ER to the plasma membrane when coexpressed with ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, or ATP8A2 and colocalized with the P4-ATPase at the plasma membrane or Golgi complex. Cell-surface biotinylation experiments further demonstrated that CDC50A and CDC50B plasma membrane expression was strongly enhanced when ATP8B1 was cotransfected (Fig. 5B). Limited amounts of CDC50A and CDC50B were detectable in the biotinylated fraction in the absence of ATP8B1 coexpression upon longer exposures of the film (data not shown). Furthermore, the expression of both CDC50A and CDC50B was enhanced upon coexpression of ATP8B1, as shown in Fig. 5B (upper panels). Finally, coexpression with ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, or ATP8A2 resulted in the appearance of an endoglycosidase H-insensitive high molecular mass CDC50A glycoprotein (Fig. 6, A, B, and D–F). This species of CDC50A was not observed in the absence of P4-ATPases or in the presence of ATP8B3 (Fig. 6C). Here, CDC50A migrated as a single band, which was endoglycosidase H-sensitive. Both the high and low molecular mass species of CDC50A were sensitive to N-glycosidase F (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Coexpression of associated P4-ATPases results in complex glycosylation of CDC50A. Lysates of U2OS cells coexpressing CDC50A with P4-ATPases were treated with endoglycosidase H (H) or N-glycosidase F (F) or left untreated (−). Complex glycosylated CDC50A (cg) and high-mannose CDC50A (hm) proteins are indicated, and the protein band labeled core represents the non-glycosylated core CDC50A protein. N-Glycosidase F cleaves all N-linked sugars from glycoproteins, whereas endoglycosidase H sensitivity is limited mainly to ER-resident glycoproteins.

Rep. 2004; 12: 939-943PubMed Google Scholar, 20Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 21Halleck M.S. Pradhan D. Blackman C. Berkes C.

Nakanishi Y. Ando H. Weinstock D. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggests that each CDC50 protein binds multiple P4-ATPases or that some P4-ATPases function without CDC50. For the majority of the human P4-ATPases, no information on the interaction with CDC50 proteins or consequence of this has been described. In this study, we systematically determined the association of class 1 P4-ATPases with CDC50 proteins and the functional consequence on subcellular location and protein abundance. We demonstrated that CDC50 proteins are pivotal for the expression and localization of human class 1 P4-ATPases. This relationship is dual, as P4-ATPases are equally important for the expression and localization of CDC50 proteins. There are three lines of evidence that support this conclusion. First, the class 1 P4-ATPases and CDC50 proteins promiscuously interact, as demonstrated with co-immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1). CDC50A interacts with five of the six investigated P4-ATPases, whereas CDC50B interacts with two P4-ATPases. CDC50A and CDC50B were previously identified as interaction partners of ATP8B1 (26Paulusma C.C. Folmer D.E. Ho-Mok K.S. de Waart D.R. Hilarius P.M. Verhoeven A.J. Oude Elferink R.P. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that CDC50A interacts not only with ATP8B1 but also with ATP8B2, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, CDC50B also interacts with ATP8B2. However, the relevance of this interaction remains unclear, as CDC50B does not enhance ATP8B2 expression or plasma membrane abundance. The interaction of CDC50 proteins with several P4-ATPase family members was previously reported in other species. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC50 protein Lem3p interacts with both Dnf1p and Dnf2p (15Saito K. Fujimura-Kamada K. Furuta N. Kato U. Umeda M. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3418-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Furuta N. Fujimura-Kamada K. Saito K. Yamamoto T. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently shown that three Arabidopsis thaliana CDC50 proteins, ALIS2, ALIS3, and ALIS4, all interact with ALA2 and ALA3, two plant P4-ATPases (14Poulsen L.R. López-Marqués R.L. McDowell S.C. Okkeri J. Licht D. Schulz A. Pomorski T. Harper J.F. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 658-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33López-Marqués R.L. Poulsen L.R. Hanisch S. Meffert K. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Jakobsen M.K. Pomorski T.G. Palmgren M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Second, most P4-ATPase/CDC50 interactions considerably enhance the total cellular expression levels of the P4-ATPases. The total cellular expression levels of all of the P4-ATPases strongly increase upon coexpression of an interaction-competent CDC50 protein (except ATP8B2/CDC50B) (Fig. 1). This relation is interdependent because coexpression of an interacting P4-ATPase with CDC50A or CDC50B also results in increased total cellular expression of the CDC50 proteins (Fig. 5). Stimulation of protein expression as a functional consequence of interactions with CDC50 proteins was previously observed for yeast Cdc50 family members and P4-ATPases (34Chen S. Wang J. Muthusamy B.P. Liu K. Zare S. Andersen R.J. Graham T.R. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1503-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) but was not investigated in detail. The P2C-ATPases (Na+/K+-ATPases and H+/K+-ATPases) are the only other members of the P-type ATPase superfamily known to interact with a β-subunit (35Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly, also P2C-ATPases and their β-subunits mutually depend on each other to adopt a stable configuration and to be exported out of the ER (36Ackermann U. Geering K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Third, the P4-ATPase/CDC50 protein interactions have functional consequences for the subcellular localization of P4-ATPases. As observed by confocal microscopy and cell-surface biotinylation, P4-ATPases translocate to the plasma membrane and/or Golgi complex upon coexpression of an interacting CDC50 protein (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). In the absence of an associated CDC50 protein, a large fraction of P4-ATPase protein is present at the ER, in particular ATP8B1, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2. ATP8B2 and ATP8B4 partially reside at the plasma membrane in U2OS cells without exogenous coexpression of CDC50 proteins, as shown by confocal microscopy. However, with cell-surface biotinylation experiments, we showed that ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2 plasma membrane expression is strongly enhanced upon coexpression of CDC50A. Again, this relationship of P4-ATPase and CDC50 proteins is interdependent; CDC50 proteins expressed individually localize mainly at the ER (Fig. 5A). Coexpression of an interacting P4-ATPase results in significant CDC50 protein translocation, as was demonstrated by confocal microscopy and cell-surface biotinylation (Fig. 5). Association with ATP8A1 and ATP8A2 results in translocation to the Golgi complex and plasma membrane (Fig. 2, E–H), whereas association with ATP8B1, ATP8B2, and ATP8B4 targets CDC50A to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). ER exit of CDC50A upon coexpression of ATP8B1, ATP8B2, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2 is further reflected by the appearance of a higher molecular mass CDC50A species, which was endoglycosidase H-insensitive/N-glycosidase F-sensitive, indicative of complex glycosylation, a post-translational modification that takes place in the Golgi complex. In the absence of an associated P4-ATPase, CDC50A migrates as a single lower molecular mass species that is sensitive to endoglycosidase H, in line with localization in the ER. Different P4-ATPases localize to different subcellular compartments, whereas they all interact with CDC50A. This suggests that the subcellular localization signals reside within the human P4-ATPase. Similarly, López-Marqués et al. (33López-Marqués R.L. Poulsen L.R. Hanisch S. Meffert K. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Jakobsen M.K. Pomorski T.G. Palmgren M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) recently showed that, in Arabidopsis, the subcellular localization of P4-ATPases after ER exit is independent of the nature of the associated CDC50 protein. Furthermore, localization of ALIS proteins (Arabidopsis CDC50 proteins) is different when coexpressed with distinct plant P4-ATPases. It is unclear if the ER localization of ATP8B3 represents its functional localization or is the result of an inability of ATP8B3 to interact with CDC50A or CDC50B. Mouse ATP8B3 and its close homolog FetA both localize to the acrosomal ridge in sperm cells (a Golgi complex-derived organelle) (29Gong E.Y. Park E. Lee H.J. Lee K. Reproduction. 2009; 137: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Wang L. Beserra C. Garbers D.L. Dev. Biol. 2004; 267: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37Xu P. Okkeri J. Hanisch S. Hu R.Y. Xu Q. Pomorski T.G. Ding X.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 2866-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation in mouse, which displays Cdc50c expression in testes, no full-length transcripts of CDC50C are found in humans, providing a possible rationale for this difference (19Osada N. Hashimoto K. Hirai M. Kusuda J. Gene. 2007; 392: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The linkage between ATP8B1 mutations and human disease suggest that this P4-ATPase displays a unique biological function. In that respect, it is remarkable that, with the exception of ATP8B3, all class 1 P4-ATPases are (partially) present at the plasma membrane. In yeast, the P4-ATPase Drs2p cannot compensate for loss of Dnf1p and Dnf2p, two P4-ATPases that localize to the plasma membrane (9Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Drs2p shows the highest homology to ATP8A1 and is also localized predominantly to the Golgi complex. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether ATP8B2 and ATP8B4 are coexpressed with ATP8B1 at the apical plasma membrane of polarized cells. At least in intestinal cells, ATP8B2 and ATP8B4 are virtually not expressed, even after knockdown of ATP8B1(38Verhulst P.M. van der Velden L.M. Oorschot V. van Faassen E.E. Klumperman J. Houwen R.H. Pomorski T.G. Holthuis J.C. Klomp L.W. Hepatology. 2010; 51: 2049-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Taken together, we have demonstrated that human CDC50 proteins are essential for ER exit of most class 1 P4-ATPases and that P4-ATPases are equally important for ER exit of CDC50 proteins. Furthermore, our data indicate that subcellular localization of the complex is determined by the P4-ATPases and that they are likely to operate at the plasma membrane, except for ATP8A1 and ATP8A2 (Golgi complex) and ATP8B3 (ER or unknown). Finally, the interactions of CDC50A and CDC50B with multiple members of the human P4-ATPase family suggest that these proteins perform broader functions in human physiology than thus far assumed.

https://openalex.org/W2013857263,"The exon junction complex (EJC) is assembled on spliced mRNAs upstream of exon-exon junctions and can regulate their subsequent translation, localization, or degradation. We isolated mutations in Drosophila mago nashi (mago), which encodes a core EJC subunit, based on their unexpectedly specific effects on photoreceptor differentiation. Loss of Mago prevents epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, due to a large reduction in MAPK mRNA levels. MAPK expression also requires the EJC subunits Y14 and eIF4AIII and EJC-associated splicing factors. Mago depletion does not affect the transcription or stability of MAPK mRNA but alters its splicing pattern. MAPK expression from an exogenous promoter requires Mago only when the template includes introns. MAPK is the primary functional target of mago in eye development; in cultured cells, Mago knockdown disproportionately affects other large genes located in heterochromatin. These data support a nuclear role for EJC components in splicing a specific subset of introns."
https://openalex.org/W2086758289,"The pathogen Bacillus anthracis secretes two potent toxins during anthrax infection, known as lethal factor (LF) and oedema factor (EF). Using transgenic Drosophila as a model system for the identification of pathways that might be involved in anthrax pathogenesis, Ethan Bier and colleagues show that these two toxins interact synergistically to block Rab11/Sec15 exocyst-dependent endocytic recycling, resulting in reduced Notch signalling and cadherin-dependent adhesion at the adherens junction. Tests in human endothelial cells indicate that the toxins have a similar effect on Rab11/Sec15 activity and Notch signalling. During infection, Bacillus anthracis secretes two potent toxins called lethal factor and oedema factor. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, these authors show that these toxins interact with the Rab11/Sec15 exocyst, which is involved in endocytic recycling. This interaction may explain vascular leakage during infection. Bacillus anthracis is the causative agent of anthrax in humans and other mammals1,2. In lethal systemic anthrax, proliferating bacilli secrete large quantities of the toxins lethal factor (LF) and oedema factor (EF), leading to widespread vascular leakage and shock. Whereas host targets of LF (mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinases) and EF (cAMP-dependent processes)3 have been implicated in the initial phase of anthrax1,2, less is understood about toxin action during the final stage of infection. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster to identify the Rab11/Sec15 exocyst, which acts at the last step of endocytic recycling, as a novel target of both EF and LF. EF reduces levels of apically localized Rab11 and indirectly blocks vesicle formation by its binding partner and effector Sec15 (Sec15–GFP), whereas LF acts more directly to reduce Sec15–GFP vesicles. Convergent effects of EF and LF on Rab11/Sec15 inhibit expression of and signalling by the Notch ligand Delta and reduce DE-cadherin levels at adherens junctions. In human endothelial cells, the two toxins act in a conserved fashion to block formation of Sec15 vesicles, inhibit Notch signalling, and reduce cadherin expression at adherens junctions. This coordinated disruption of the Rab11/Sec15 exocyst by anthrax toxins may contribute to toxin-dependent barrier disruption and vascular dysfunction during B. anthracis infection."
https://openalex.org/W2090723594,"Meiotic crossover (CO) recombination establishes physical linkages between homologous chromosomes that are required for their proper segregation into developing gametes, and promotes genetic diversity by shuffling genetic material between parental chromosomes. COs require the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs) to create the substrate for strand exchange. DSBs occur in small intervals called hotspots and significant variation in hotspot usage exists between and among individuals. This variation is thought to reflect differences in sequence identity and chromatin structure, DNA topology and/ or chromosome domain organization. Chromosomes show different frequencies of nondisjunction (NDJ), reflecting inherent differences in meiotic crossover control, yet the underlying basis of these differences remains elusive. Here we show that a novel chromatin factor, X non-disjunction factor 1 (xnd-1), is responsible for the global distribution of COs in C. elegans. xnd-1 is also required for formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) on the X, but surprisingly XND-1 protein is autosomally enriched. We show that xnd-1 functions independently of genes required for X chromosome-specific gene silencing, revealing a novel pathway that distinguishes the X from autosomes in the germ line, and further show that xnd-1 exerts its effects on COs, at least in part, by modulating levels of H2A lysine 5 acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W1996654743,"Elastin is a self-assembling protein of the extracellular matrix that provides tissues with elastic extensibility and recoil. The monomeric precursor, tropoelastin, is highly hydrophobic yet remains substantially disordered and flexible in solution, due in large part to a high combined threshold of proline and glycine residues within hydrophobic sequences. In fact, proline-poor elastin-like sequences are known to form amyloid-like fibrils, rich in β-structure, from solution. On this basis, it is clear that hydrophobic elastin sequences are in general optimized to avoid an amyloid fate. However, a small number of hydrophobic domains near the C terminus of tropoelastin are substantially depleted of proline residues. Here we investigated the specific contribution of proline number and spacing to the structure and self-assembly propensities of elastin-like polypeptides. Increasing the spacing between proline residues significantly decreased the ability of polypeptides to reversibly self-associate. Real-time imaging of the assembly process revealed the presence of smaller colloidal droplets that displayed enhanced propensity to cluster into dense networks. Structural characterization showed that these aggregates were enriched in β-structure but unable to bind thioflavin-T. These data strongly support a model where proline-poor regions of the elastin monomer provide a unique contribution to assembly and suggest a role for localized β-sheet in mediating self-assembly interactions."

Biologically, HDAC9 regulates a wide variety of normal and abnormal physiological functions, including cardiac growth, T-regulatory cell function, neuronal disorders, muscle differentiation, development, and cancer. In a biochemical approach to identify non-histone substrates of HDAC9, we found that HDAC9 co-purifies specifically with the ataxia telangiectasia group D-complementing (ATDC; also called TRIM29) protein. HDAC9 deacetylates ATDC, alters the ability of ATDC to associate with p53, and consequently inhibits the cell proliferation-promoting activity of ATDC. These results implicate the importance of non-histone deacetylation by HDAC9 and confirm and further extend the multifunctions of this Class II deacetylase."

IntroductionMetabolic syndrome is emerging as a global epidemic in both industrialized and developing countries. Obesity is a central component of this syndrome and arises from a chronic imbalance of energy intake and energy expenditure (1Flier J.S.

Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Excess fat storage in the adipose tissue, and more importantly, ectopic lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and the liver lead to development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (3Erion D.M. Shulman G.I. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although there is no doubt that environmental factors, particularly high-calorie diets and sedentary life style, contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, various genetic and epigenetic factors underlie the predisposition of individuals to metabolic disorders. The homeostatic control of energy intake and expenditure is achieved through a complex network of nutritional, hormonal, and neural cues, which coordinates nutrient storage and fuel oxidation in peripheral tissues. In mammals, nuclear hormone receptors as well as their coactivators and corepressors play an important role in the regulation of diverse aspects of tissue metabolism (4Beaven S.W. Tontonoz P. Annu.

Paradoxically, whole body PGC-1α-null mice are resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity (21Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jäger S. Vianna C.R.

However, it remains unknown whether PGC-1α influences energy balance and clock function directly through its action in peripheral tissues or via its function in the central nervous system. PGC-1α mRNA and protein expression has been observed in several brain areas and neuronal cell types (29Cowell R.M. Blake K.R. Russell J.W. J. Comp.

These studies strongly suggest PGC-1α plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal health. Whether neuronal PGC-1α is required for systemic metabolic homeostasis has not yet been explored.To address the role of neuronal PGC-1α in the regulation of energy balance, we generated forebrain-specific PGC-1α null mice by crossing PGC-1αflox/flox mice with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα)-Cre transgenic mice. We found that inactivation of PGC-1α in CaMKIIα-positive neurons leads to resistance to diet-induced obesity and results in neurodegenerative lesions in the striatum. Our studies reveal an essential role of PGC-1α in CaMKIIα-positive neurons in the regulation of energy balance and neuronal function.DISCUSSIONThe brain is a highly metabolically active tissue and relies on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism for ATP production under normal conditions. Not surprisingly, neurons are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations of mitochondrial function. Impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism has been implicated in numerous heritable neurological disorders as well as neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington, Parkinson, and Alzheimer disease (51DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 52Lin M.T. Beal M.F. Nature. 2006; 443: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar, 53Schon E.A. Manfredi G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is abundantly expressed in the brain and its deficiency leads to degenerative lesions in several brain regions. However, whether these lesions arise from cell-autonomous functions of PGC-1α in neurons remains unknown. In addition, the neuronal cell types that require PGC-1α for their normal function have not been identified. In this study, we demonstrate that PGC-1α in CaMKIIα-positive neurons plays an important role in maintaining systemic energy balance and neuronal health.We have previously reported that mice lacking PGC-1α are resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity and have significantly improved insulin sensitivity (21Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jäger S. Vianna C.R. Reznick R.M. Cui L. Manieri M. Donovan M.X. Wu Z. Cooper M.P. Fan M.C. Rohas L.M. Zavacki A.M. Cinti S.

This lean phenotype is associated with elevated metabolic rate and activity levels. Because PGC-1α is expressed in several key metabolic tissues, including skeletal muscle, adipose tissues, and liver (13Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3030) Google Scholar), it was not immediately clear which tissue(s) underlies altered systemic energy balance in whole body PGC-1α null mice. To complicate the matter further, PGC-1α regulates distinct metabolic programs in different tissues, which influence systemic metabolism through crosstalk and secondary effects. To resolve these issues, we generated brain-specific PGC-1α null mice using CaMKIIα-Cre transgenic line. PGC-1α is abundantly expressed in pyramidal neurons, many of which also express CaMKIIα (54Ouimet C.C. McGuinness T.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 5604-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), as well as GABAergic neurons (29Cowell R.M. Blake K.R. Russell J.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 502: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Tritos N.A. Mastaitis J.W. Kokkotou E.G. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Maratos-Flier E. Brain Res. 2003; 961: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). BαKO mice are capable of mounting normal metabolic responses in peripheral tissues. For example, the induction of genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation following starvation is similar in control and BαKO mice. In addition, the activation of adaptive thermogenesis in brown fat in response to cold exposure is normal in BαKO mice. Unlike whole body PGC-1α null mice, which are extremely cold-sensitive, BαKO mice are indistinguishable from control mice in maintaining their core body temperature. These observations allow us to assess the biological function of neuronal PGC-1α in the absence of the confounding metabolic perturbations in peripheral tissues caused by global PGC-1α deficiency.Perhaps the most remarkable outcome of neuronal PGC-1α deficiency is its influence on systemic energy balance when the mice were fed a high-fat diet. Compared with control mice, BαKO mice gain significantly less body weight and have lower adiposity following 10 weeks of high-fat feeding. The resistance to weight gain in BαKO mice appears to be quantitatively less pronounced than whole body PGC-1α null mice, suggesting that PGC-1α in CaMKIIα-negative cells in nervous system and/or peripheral tissues may also contribute to its effects on systemic energy balance. Additionally, in both BαKO and whole body PGC-1α null mice, fasting-induced expression of AgRP and NPY in hypothalamus is impaired in the absence of PGC-1α. These observations are consistent with previous studies that implicate FoxO1, a transcriptional partner for PGC-1α, in the regulation of AgRP gene expression in hypothalamus (55Kitamura T. Feng Y. Kitamura Y.I. Chua Jr., S.C. Xu A.W. Barsh G.S. Rossetti L. Accili D. Nat Med. 2006; 12: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 56Puigserver P. Rhee J. Donovan J. Walkey C.J. Yoon J.C. Oriente F. Kitamura Y. Altomonte J. Dong H. Accili D. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). A recent report showed that PGC-1α expression is present in NPY expressing neurons of the dorsalmedial hypothalamic nucleus (57Draper S. Kirigiti M. Glavas M. Grayson B. Chong C.N. Jiang B. Smith M.S. Zeltser L.M. Grove K.L. Brain Res. 2010; 1350: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Together, these findings illustrate a potential role for the FoxO1/PGC-1α pathway in the regulation of hypothalamic transcription and function. The significance of AgRP and NPY in mediating the effects of PGC-1α on energy balance remains unknown at present.Besides less weight gain under high-fat diet, BαKO mice also have reduced hepatic lipid content and lower plasma insulin levels, suggesting that these mice are more insulin-sensitive. However, BαKO mice are similar to control group in insulin tolerance and glucose tolerance tests. In contrast, whole body PGC-1α null mice have significantly lower blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance. A plausible explanation for these differences is that hepatic glucose output is impaired in whole body PGC-1α null mice, whereas it remains normal in BαKO mice. In fact, fasting glucose levels are similar between control and BαKO mice when kept on chow diet. As such, impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis may significantly contribute to improved glucose homeostasis in whole body PGC-1α null mice.Surprisingly, although BαKO mice have increased oxygen consumption rate in CLAMS studies, these mice appear to have normal activity levels. In addition, diurnal regulation of locomotor activity is apparently unaffected in these mice. These results suggest that distinct neuronal populations might mediate the function of PGC-1α in the regulation of energy balance and circadian pacemaker. In this case, PGC-1α activity in CaMKIIα-positive neurons is essential for the control of metabolic rate and body weight homeostasis, whereas its regulation of biological clock is mediated by a distinct population of PGC-1α expressing neurons. Previous studies have shown that PGC-1α is also expressed in GABAergic neurons (29Cowell R.M. Blake K.R. Russell J.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 502: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whether PGC-1α in GABAergic neurons is required for maintaining normal circadian metabolic rhythms remains to be addressed. It is also possible that certain CaMKIIα neurons may lack Cre expression. We cannot rule out the possibility that intact PGC-1α expression in a subset of CaMKIIα-positive neurons could mediate its role in circadian regulation.We observed neurodenegerative lesions in the striatum of BαKO mouse brain. The striking similarity in the appearance of vacuoles in BαKO and whole body PGC-1α null mice strongly suggests that the deficiency of PGC-1α in CaMKIIα-positive neurons is the major neuronal population affected in whole body PGC-1α null mouse brain. Interestingly, we observed fewer lesions in the striatum and deep layers of cerebral cortex in BαKO mice. It remains to be determined whether this is due to partial deletion of PGC-1α in CaMKIIα-positive neurons or other cell types also contribute to neurodegeneration in whole body PGC-1α null mice. Because CaMKIIα is only modestly expressed in the striatum, our data suggest that the degenerative lesions are most likely due to the defects of neurons that reside in other brain areas, such as the cortex. Although autophagy is emerging as an important mechanism in neuronal homeostasis, we did not observe significant changes in autophagy activity in whole body PGC-1α null and BαKO mice compared with their respective control. It is likely that disruption of mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species metabolism may be responsible for the development of neuronal lesions in the absence of PGC-1α.In summary, we have demonstrated that PGC-1α activity in CaMKIIα neurons plays a key role in the regulation of energy balance and neuronal health. The resistance to diet-induced obesity and brain lesions in BαKO mice are strikingly similar to whole body PGC-1α null mice. These results strongly suggest that neuronal PGC-1α exerts profound effects on the neural circuitry that governs systemic energy balance. IntroductionMetabolic syndrome is emerging as a global epidemic in both industrialized and developing countries. Obesity is a central component of this syndrome and arises from a chronic imbalance of energy intake and energy expenditure (1Flier J.S.

Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Excess fat storage in the adipose tissue, and more importantly, ectopic lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and the liver lead to development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (3Erion D.M. Shulman G.I. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although there is no doubt that environmental factors, particularly high-calorie diets and sedentary life style, contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, various genetic and epigenetic factors underlie the predisposition of individuals to metabolic disorders. The homeostatic control of energy intake and expenditure is achieved through a complex network of nutritional, hormonal, and neural cues, which coordinates nutrient storage and fuel oxidation in peripheral tissues. In mammals, nuclear hormone receptors as well as their coactivators and corepressors play an important role in the regulation of diverse aspects of tissue metabolism (4Beaven S.W. Tontonoz P. Annu.

Their expression is highly regulated in response to various physiological and environmental signals. For example, PGC-1α is rapidly induced in skeletal muscle following physical exercise (14Baar K.

Paradoxically, whole body PGC-1α-null mice are resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity (21Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jäger S. Vianna C.R.

This alteration in systemic energy balance is associated with elevated metabolic rate and physical activity levels as well as disrupted circadian rhythm (28Liu C. Li S. Liu T. Borjigin J. Lin J.D. Nature. 2007; 447: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether PGC-1α influences energy balance and clock function directly through its action in peripheral tissues or via its function in the central nervous system. PGC-1α mRNA and protein expression has been observed in several brain areas and neuronal cell types (29Cowell R.M. Blake K.R. Russell J.W. J. Comp.

Whole body PGC-1α null mice develop spongioform neurodegeneration, most notably in the striatum and the deep layers of the cerebral cortex.

These studies strongly suggest PGC-1α plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal health. Whether neuronal PGC-1α is required for systemic metabolic homeostasis has not yet been explored.To address the role of neuronal PGC-1α in the regulation of energy balance, we generated forebrain-specific PGC-1α null mice by crossing PGC-1αflox/flox mice with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα)-Cre transgenic mice. We found that inactivation of PGC-1α in CaMKIIα-positive neurons leads to resistance to diet-induced obesity and results in neurodegenerative lesions in the striatum. Our studies reveal an essential role of PGC-1α in CaMKIIα-positive neurons in the regulation of energy balance and neuronal function."

One means by which FN contributes to these processes is through the formation of insoluble fibrils, a process known as FN assembly (6Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

FN assembly is a cell-mediated process that requires the N-terminal 70-kDa region (70K) in the initial interaction between FN and the cell surface (8Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 70K contains nine type I (FNI) modules and two type II (FNII) modules (Fig. 1A). FNI modules are composed of ∼45 amino acids and contain a major β-sheet (C-, D-, and E-strands), a minor β-sheet (A- and B-strands), and two conserved disulfide bonds (9Mosher D.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 214-222Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). FNI modules are rare and only found in chordates (10Tucker R.P. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Int. J. Biochem.

In vertebrates, besides the 12 FNI modules in FN, there are single FNI modules in hepatocyte growth factor-activating protease, tissue plasminogen activator, and FXII (11Maas C. Schiks B.

The 27-kDa (27K, N-5FNI) fibrin-binding and 40-kDa (40K, 6FNI-9FNI) gelatin-binding subfragments of 70K are much less potent inhibitors of FN assembly than 70K (12McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). 70K missing individual FNI modules or blocks of FNI modules also binds less well to cells (17Sottile J. Schwarzbauer J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, binding of 70K to the cell surface requires multiple FNI modules. The cell surface molecules mediating the interaction between the tandem FNI modules of 70K with fibroblasts or platelets are not known.

FUD includes an N-terminal nonrepetitive sequence, which is thought to interact with the gelatin-binding domain, and a single FN binding repeat (FNBR) at the C terminus (Fig. 1B) (21Schwarz-Linek U.

Nonrepetitive sequences similar to that in FUD are also found in Streptococcus equisimilis and Borrelia burgdorferi (21Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). FNBRs are found in many FN-binding members of the microbial surface components recognizing the adhesive matrix molecule family (20Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Mol.

Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), it was shown that peptides based on the FNBRs in SfbI bind to 1FNI-5FNI or 2FNI-5FNI (26Schwarz-Linek U. Pilka E.S. Pickford A.R. Kim J.H. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39017-39025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy showed that these peptides bind to tandem FNI modules by a distinctive interaction with the E-strands of 2FNI-3FNI or 4FNI-5FNI in an anti-parallel β-sheet (26Schwarz-Linek U.

This type of interaction, known as the β-zipper, was first recognized in NMR studies of FNBR-derived peptides from the Streptococcus dysgalactiae FNBP bound to 1FNI-2FNII (27Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). It appears to be a common mechanism of interaction for FNBPs, including those not in Gram-positive cocci, as well as unstructured proteins lacking FNBRs, including the Leptospiral Immunoglobulin-like protein B from Leptrospira interrogans (28Bingham R.J.

Here, we have used FUD mutants, epitope-mapped anti-FN monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and physical techniques to define the binding interaction between FUD and FN. Mutagenesis studies indicated that the binding site for FN extends throughout FUD and that spacing and sequencing of FUD residues are essential. Studies of various FN constructs demonstrated tighter binding of FUD to 70K than to intact FN and implicated both the fibrin- and gelatin-binding domains of 70K. Locations of epitopes of mAbs that influenced the interaction of FUD with FN extend from 2FNI to 1FNIII. Circular dichroism (CD) and homology modeling supported the possibility that C-terminal residues of FUD interact with 2FNI-5FNI and N-terminal residues of FUD can interact with 8FNI and 9FNI via β-strand addition. The FUD mutants and mAbs that blocked binding of FUD to FN also blocked FN assembly by cultured fibroblasts, suggesting that cell surface molecules on cells may interact with the N terminus of FN via the same paradigm as FUD. Human plasma FN was prepared by heat precipitation and anion exchange chromatography of a fibrinogen-rich fraction as described previously (32Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma FN of rat, cow, and mouse was purified from plasma by gelatin affinity chromatography. Proteolytic 70K (Fig. 1A) was prepared as described previously (12McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding rat FN was described previously (9Mosher D.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 214-222Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Sottile J. Schwarzbauer J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat cDNA was used as template for PCR to create rat 70K and the following mutants: rat 70K K108R, rat 70K N221S, and rat 70K R567G. Primers specific for rat FN were used to introduce restrictions sites for cloning into the baculovirus expression vector pAcGP67.coco (33Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The expressed protein begins at residue Gln-33, which is the start of the mature protein after the pre-prosequence, and ends at residue Pro-606. The human sequence begins at the same relative position, but the numbering (Gln-32) is off by one through residue 275 in comparing human with rat FN because in rat compared with human FN there is an extra residue in the pre-prosequence that is compensated for by absence of one residue in the linker between 5FNI and 6FNI of the rat protein. Mutated rat residues are numbered according to the rat sequence. A schematic of human FN constructs is shown in Fig. 1A. Recombinant 70K (N-9FNI, residues 32–608), N-5FNI (residues 32–290), N-3FNI (residues 32–183), 4FNI-5FNI (residues 184 to 290), 6FNI-9FNI (residues 291–608), 7FNI-9FNI (residues 468–608), and N-3FNIII and N-3FNIII Q690R (residues 32–904) were expressed as secreted His-tagged proteins using the baculovirus vector pAcGP67.coco (COCO) (8Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of 1FNIII-C EDA+ (V89) were described previously (34Xu J. Bae E. Zhang Q. Annis D.S. Erickson H.P. Mosher D.F. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography. Recombinant human and rat 70K, rat 70K mutants, and N-5FNI were dialyzed into 10 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 1 m NaBr, pH 7.4. 6FNI-9FNI and 7FNI-9FNI were dialyzed into Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). 1FNIII-C EDA+ (V89) was dialyzed into 10 mm MOPS, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. All other constructs were dialyzed into 10 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Concentration was determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm as predicted from amino acid composition using Protopram at the ExPASy website. The murine mAbs 7D5, 4D1, and 5C3 were selected from a panel of mAbs generated against recombinant human 70K. These antibodies were produced in collaboration with Dr. MaryAnn Accavitti-Loper and the University of Alabama-Birmingham Epitope Recognition and Immunoreagent Core Facility. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were raised using the cathepsin D 70K fragment of human FN (35Sottile J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1990; 1: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). L8 was described previously (36Chernousov M.A. Fogerty F.J. Koteliansky V.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because we encountered instability with pELMER previously used to express FUD (37Ensenberger M.G. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), recombinant FUD constructs were expressed in pET-28c+ (EMD, Gibbstown, NJ) that was modified to contain a piece of the multiple cloning site of pELMER. Thus, a segment of pELMER that encoded the N-terminal His6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site along with the multiple cloning site was inserted into pET-28c+ to create pET-ELMER. Mutations were introduced into FUD in pELMER using PCR-based strategies, and the mutated DNA was then inserted into pET-ELMER. The presence of correct sequences was confirmed. Constructs in pET-ELMER were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (EMD) for expression and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacteria were lysed in lysis buffer with or without urea. The cleared lysate was incubated overnight with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen), washed, and eluted with elution buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The His tag was removed as described previously (37Ensenberger M.G. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) except that 1 unit of biotinylated thrombin per mg of protein was added for 2 h. Proteins were further purified via fast protein liquid chromatography (GE Healthcare) using a High-Trap Mono Q column. To do this, proteins were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and eluted via a NaCl gradient from 20 to 300 mm. Most proteins eluted at ∼100 mm NaCl. Proteins that eluted outside the range of 80–120 mm NaCl were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The sequence of FUD is given in Fig. 1C. It should be noted that the protein is 56 rather than 49 residues in length with N- and C-terminal “tails” of 5 and 2 residues, respectively, introduced by the expression strategy (Fig. 1C). The quality of the constructs was assessed by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. All were pure on an overloaded gel and homogeneous and were of the expected mass as shown by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm for cleaved proteins, which were calculated using Protopram from ExPASy. Fluorescein isothiocyanate FN (FITC-FN) was made as described previously (12McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). FUD was dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 137 mm NaCl, 1.76 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4), and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) at 20-fold molar excess of FUD was added at room temperature for 1 h after which unincorporated biotin was removed by dialysis into PBS followed by 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. FN−/− mouse fibroblasts were derived from stem cells of FN knock-out mice (1George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (38Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Coverslips were coated with 15 μg/ml laminin. FN−/− cells were plated 3 h prior to addition of 20 nm FITC-FN and 50 or 500 nm FUD, FUD mutants, 40 μg/ml mAbs, or control mouse IgG (Pharmingen) in DMEM plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Following a 45-min incubation, cells were washed once and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed, and mounted on slides using Immuno-mount (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) as described previously (8Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were viewed on an Olympus epifluorescence microscope, and representative fields were digitally photographed using the same exposure time as optimized for cells not treated with FUDs or mAbs. Enzyme-linked assays were done using high binding plates (Corning 3590) coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of 10 μg/ml (40 nm) human or rat FN, 2.7 μg/ml (40 nm) 70K, or 7.7 μg/ml (40 nm) 1FNIII-C EDA+, or human or rat recombinant constructs (10 μg/ml) with mutations described above. Plates were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). For the experiment looking at binding of biotinylated-FUD (b-FUD), increasing concentrations of b-FUD were incubated on the plate for 2 h in TBST containing 0.1% BSA. For competition of b-FUD binding, 0.3 nm b-FUD was added to wells simultaneously with the indicated concentration of FN or FN construct; unlabeled FUD or FUD mutant; or purified 4D1, 7D5, or 5C3; or 1 mm ZnSO4 in TBST containing 0.1% BSA for 2 h. Plates were washed and incubated with a 1:20,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. For experiments examining the effects of increasing concentrations of FUD or d29 or mAb binding, 1:50,000 dilution of 4D1 or 7D5 ascites, a 1:30,000 dilution of 5C3 ascites, or 0.1 μg/ml purified L8 IgG was added to wells simultaneously with increasing concentrations of FUD or d29 in TBST containing 0.1% BSA for 2 h. Plates were washed and incubated with 1:5000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase donkey α-mouse secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. 4-Nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate was used at 1 mg/ml in TBS, pH 9.0 (Sigma). Some assays were stopped with an equal volume of 3 n NaOH. Absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a Tecan Genios Pro (Tecan, Durham, NC) microplate reader. All conditions were tested in triplicate and compared with antibody alone or b-FUD alone after background subtraction. Unless indicated otherwise, the graphs are means ± S.D. of the means of triplicates from three to four separate experiments. ITC was carried out with a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, LLC) at 25 °C. The cell had a volume of 2.2 ml. In a typical experiment, the cell contained 1.4 ml of a solution of FN or 70K, and the syringe contained 1 ml of FUD. The titration was performed in 37 injections (1 × 1, 4 × 4, and 32 × 8 μl) delivered at 120-s intervals into the protein solution. The initial data point was routinely discarded. The concentrations of FUD, FN, and 70K are described in Table 1. The interaction of FUD-FN was in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, and the interaction of FUD-70K was in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Data were fit by Lavenberg-Marquardt nonlinear regression with Origin 7.0 using the one-site model.TABLE 1ITC analysis of FUD binding to FN or 70KInteraction[FUD][FN]/[70K]ΔHΔSΔGKdnμmμmkcal mol−1cal mol−1 K−1kcal mol−1nmFUD-FN2048.95−29.9−72−9.9591.7FUD-70K15.81.4−44.3−117−11.35.21.1 Open table in a new tab CD analysis was performed on an AVIV stopped flow CD spectrometer under N2 atmosphere. Five spectra were obtained at 25 °C in 0.1-cm path length cells and from 190 to 280 nm for far-UV CD for each condition. Heat denaturation of 70K or FUD was done by measuring the ellipticity after heating the jacketed cells to 40, 60, and 80 °C at 5 °C/min. Spectra were recorded in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Spectra of 1 μm FUD, 70K, or 1:1 FUD-70K complex were obtained at 25 °C. Changes due to formation of the FUD-70K complex were explored by comparison of the sum of the spectra of FUD and 70K to the spectrum of the complex and by subtraction of the spectrum of 70K from the spectrum of the complex. In the latter case, the spectrum of FUD and the difference spectrum were also expressed as mean residue ellipticity in units of degrees cm2 dmol−1 of FUD, assuming that all of the difference was due to a change in the conformation of FUD upon complex formation. In CD experiments, the background spectrum of buffer without protein is subtracted from the protein spectrum. Western blots were performed as described previously (39Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Approximate molar equivalents (5 pmol) of human 70K, rat 70K, or rat 70K mutant proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were detected with mAbs 4D1, 7D5, 5C3, and L8 or polyclonal antibody raised against human 70K. Antigen diluted to 10 μg/ml in TBS or, for chicken FN, plasma diluted 1:10 was used to coat 96-well microtiter plates (Costar 3590, Corning Inc., Corning, NY), where blocking, washing, and antibody addition were carried out as described previously (39Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The appropriate species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was incubated with the plate for 1 h. After washing four times with TBST, 50 μl per well of SureBlue TMB peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to each well. Color development was monitored, and after a 5–30-min incubation, 50 μl per well of TMB stop solution (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was added followed by measurement of absorbance at 450 nm. For homology modeling, we used Protein Data Bank structures of the C-terminal STATT-5 peptide from the fifth FNBR of Staphylococcus aureus FN-binding protein A (FNBPA) bound to 2FNI-3FNI (Protein Data Bank code 3CAL), the N-terminal STAFF-5 peptide from FNBR-5 of FNBPA bound to 4FNI-5FNI (Protein Data Bank code 2RLO) (28Bingham R.J. Rudiño-Piñera E. Meenan N.A. Schwarz-Linek U. Turkenburg J.P. Höök M. Garman E.F. Potts J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12254-12258Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and a peptide from the α1(I) chain of type I collagen bound to 8FNI-9FNI (Protein Data Bank code 3EJH) (40Erat M.C. Slatter D.A. Lowe E.D. Millard C.J. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4195-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Using Sybyl modeling software (Tripos Corp., St. Louis), we built FUD in place of FNBPA-5 or collagen peptide and energy-minimized the resulting structures. Because the collagen peptide did not extend completely through 9FNI, to model the interaction between FUD and 9FNI, we copied the peptide bound to 8FNI, placed it on 9FNI, and substituted residues as with other modules. Side chains were manually torsioned to relieve clashes with the backbone fixed. After addition of hydrogens and Gasteiger-Hückel charges, energy minimization was performed using the Tripos force field in Sybyl, first using the Simplex minimization, followed by the Powell conjugate gradient minimization (41Powell M. Math. Program. 1977; 12: 241-254Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Additional modeling was done of various 6-residue peptides bound to individual FNI modules. Minimization was terminated when the gradient of change was less than 0.05 kcal/(mol·Å). To understand better the interaction between FUD and FN, we utilized monomeric recombinant FUD with short N- and C-terminal tails (Fig. 1C). This construct contains the unique upstream sequence plus the first FNBR of the F1 adhesin (SfbI) (Fig. 1B). Because of vector instability with the previously used pELMER vector that allowed expression of such a monomeric protein (37Ensenberger M.G. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we modified pET-28c+ to include a thrombin cleavage site after the N-terminal His-tag as in pELMER. FUD and FUD mutants were cleaved with thrombin and purified via fast protein liquid chromatography. The material was highly pure by SDS-PAGE and contained a single species of the correct mass as accessed by mass spectrometry. We used an enzyme-linked assay to quantify the ability of b-FUD to bind to surfaces coated with dimeric FN, monomeric 70K, or dimeric 1FNIII-C EDA+ that lacked the 70K N-terminal regions. b-FUD bound to FN and 70K, but not 1FNIII-C EDA+, as expected (18Ensenberger M.G.

This allows IRF-1 to reach new steady state protein levels swiftly in response to changing environmental conditions. Whereas CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), appears to chaperone IRF-1 in unstressed cells, formation of a stable IRF-1·CHIP complex is seen under specific stress conditions. Complex formation, in heat- or heavy metal-treated cells, is accompanied by a decrease in IRF-1 steady state levels and an increase in IRF-1 ubiquitination. CHIP binds directly to an intrinsically disordered domain in the central region of IRF-1 (residues 106–140), and this site is sufficient to form a stable complex with CHIP in cells and to compete in trans with full-length IRF-1, leading to a reduction in its ubiquitination. The study reveals a complex relationship between CHIP and IRF-1 and highlights the role that direct binding or “docking” of CHIP to its substrate(s) can play in its mechanism of action as an E3 ligase.

IRF-1 (interferon regulatory factor-1) is a transcription factor initially identified as an activator of IFNβ (interferon-β gene) (1Fujita T. Sakakibara J. Sudo Y. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3397-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), which has subsequently been intimately linked to the antiviral response and the response to DNA damage (2Tanaka N. Ishihara M.

Ball K.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For example, agents such as ionizing radiation increase steady state levels of the IRF-1 protein through a concerted mechanism that includes a decrease in its rate of degradation (2Tanaka N.

Like other proteins degraded via the proteasome, IRF-1 is polyubiquitinated prior to degradation (8Pion E. Narayan V. Eckert M. Ball K.L. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Nakagawa K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1680-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination process itself involves at least three distinct enzymes. A ubiquitin (Ub) 4The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinTPRtetratricopeptide repeatpAbpolyclonal antibodyaaamino acids.-activating enzyme, or E1, activates Ub and forms a Ub-thiol ester in an ATP-dependent process subsequently. A ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), which associates with a ubiquitin ligase (E3), is involved in ubiquitin transfer from the E1 to the substrate through the E3. The E3 and occasionally the E2·E3 complex give specificity to the system because they are involved in substrate recognition (11Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Although IRF-1 has been characterized as a substrate of the ubiquitination system, the E3 ligase(s) involved in IRF-1 ubiquitination have not yet been identified. ubiquitin tetratricopeptide repeat polyclonal antibody amino acids. In the current study, we describe an interaction between IRF-1 and CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), leading to the identification of CHIP as an E3 ligase for IRF-1. CHIP is thought to provide a link between the protein folding pathway(s) and the pathways within a cell that lead to protein degradation. Structurally, CHIP comprises an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, through which it can bind to the Hsp70 and Hsp90 families of molecular chaperones; a central charged domain that is required for dimerization but otherwise has a largely unknown function; and a C-terminal U-box structure that binds E2 enzymes and mediates CHIP function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (12Nikolay R.

The U-box is structurally similar to the RING (really interesting new gene) domain present in the RING family of E3 Ub ligases, although it is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds and salt bridges rather than Zn2+ ions (16Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It is commonly believed that CHIP binds to Hsp70 and targets misfolded client proteins for degradation, bypassing the need for a direct interaction with its substrate (17Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 18Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Recently, however, a number of studies have suggested an alternate CHIP ubiquitination pathway in which the substrate binding activity of CHIP may play a key role in determining its specific E3 ligase function (19Shang Y.

Here we present evidence in support of diverse roles for CHIP in the regulation of IRF-1. Although CHIP has a positive effect on IRF-1 protein levels in unstressed cells, in response to specific stresses, such as heat and heavy metal stress, CHIP binds directly to a docking site in the central region of IRF-1 facilitating IRF-1 ubiquitination. Thus, (i) CHIP and IRF-1 can form a stable complex in vitro and in cells that does not require Hsp70, (ii) CHIP binding to an intrinsically disordered domain of IRF-1 is required for its ubiquitination because this domain can act in trans to interact with CHIP and inhibit ubiquitination of IRF-1, and (iii) CHIP·IRF-1 complex formation is regulated in cells exposed to selective stress conditions and correlates with an increase in IRF-1 ubiquitination and a decrease in its steady state levels. Therefore, direct binding of both Hsp70 (21Narayan V. Eckert M. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25889-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and CHIP can regulate IRF-1, highlighting the intimate link between the molecular chaperones and IRF-1 function. Antibodies were used at the concentrations indicated by the supplier and were anti-IRF-1 mAb (catalog no. 612047, BD Biosciences), anti-GFP mAb and pAb (catalog nos. 632380 and 632459, Clontech), anti-GAPDH pAb (catalog no. ab9483, Abcam), anti-FLAG mAb, anti-Myc pAb, anti-GST mAb, anti-β-actin mAb, and anti-vimentin mAb (catalog nos.

Anti-CHIP mAb (MBC3) was from Moravian Biotechnology, and anti-Myc mAb was obtained from CRUK. Secondary antibodies were purchased from DakoCytomation. MG-132 (Calbiochem) was dissolved in DMSO to 10 mm and used as indicated. Peptides were from Chiron Mimotopes and were synthesized with a biotin tag and an SGSG spacer at the N terminus. The human IRF-1 sequence was codon-optimized for Escherichia coli expression (Genscript) and inserted into pDEST-15 using Gateway technology (Invitrogen) to generate GST-IRF-1. FLAG-IRF-1 was generated by amplifying an EcoRI-IRF-1-BamHI fragment from pcDNA3-IRF-1 (8Pion E. Narayan V. Eckert M. Ball K.L. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and ligating it into p3xFLAG-Myc-CMV-24 (Sigma). For IRF-1 Δ106–140, the BlpI internal site on human IRF-1 was used. A BlpI-IRF-1(141–325)-BamHI fragment was amplified from FLAG-IRF-1 WT and ligated with FLAG-IRF-1 WT that was digested with BlpI and BamHI to give IRF-1 Δ106–140; this was inserted into the Gateway system by introducing attB1 and attB2 sites according to the manufacturer's instructions. pDEST53-IRF-1 (GFP-IRF-1) was as described previously (8Pion E.

Signal. 2009; 21: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). pET15bmod-CHIP was a kind gift from Prof. Alicja Zylicz and Renata Filipek, and pMBC1-IRF-1(115–140) (GFP-IRF-1(115–140)) was from the Hauser group (22Schaper F.

GST-IRF-1 expressed in BL21-AI (Invitrogen) was purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. His-CHIP was expressed in BL21-DE3 and purified using Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In both cases, Mg2+-ATP washes were incorporated prior to elution to remove any bound chaperones. Additionally, untagged human IRF-1 was expressed and purified in a cell-free environment using the PURExpress in vitro protein synthesis kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A375, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen), whereas H1299, OVCAR8, HCC-827, DU-145, A549, and ACHN were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Autogen Bioclear) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin mix (Invitrogen). A375 and HeLa cells were maintained at 10% CO2; all remaining cells were maintained at 5% CO2. Cells were seeded 24 h before transfection. DNA was transfected into the cells using Attractene (Qiagen) and siRNA (OnTargetPlus siRNA pools from Dharmacon; catalogue no. D-001810-10-20 for control siRNA pool and L-007201-00-0020 for CHIP siRNA pool) using Dharmafect (Thermo Scientific) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. If required, cells were treated as follows. For serum starvation, serum was withdrawn from the media at the time of transfection 24 h prior to harvesting; heat shock was carried out at 43 °C for 30 min immediately prior to harvesting unless otherwise indicated; for heavy metal stress, cells were treated with 1 mm ZnCl2 for 90 min. MG-132 treatment (50 μm) was for 4 h prior to harvesting. Post harvesting, cells were lysed in Triton Lysis Buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mix (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 mm pefabloc)) unless otherwise indicated. Immunoblots were performed as described previously (21Narayan V. Eckert M. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25889-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To detect endogenous IRF-1, 75 μg of protein was loaded per lane, whereas 25 μg was sufficient to detect exogenous IRF-1. FLAG-IRF-1 or GFP-IRF-1 (or corresponding empty vector) was transfected into A375 cells as described above. Post-transfection (24 h), cells were harvested and lysed in Triton Lysis Buffer. Following this, the lysates were precleared using Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma). FLAG-tagged complexes from 3 mg of total cellular lysate were purified using anti-FLAG-M2-agarose (35 μl; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot. GFP-tagged complexes were isolated by incubating precleared lysate (7.5 mg) with protein G-Sepharose beads (40 μl; GE Healthcare) and anti-GFP pAb (5 μl) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with PBS supplemented with 0.4% Triton X-100 and eluted by heating at 90 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. For affinity chromatography, GST-tagged IRF-1 and GST alone were purified as described above; however, bound GST-proteins were not eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose column. Instead, precleared A375 cell lysate (1 mg) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The column was washed five times with PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and once with Buffer W (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine). Bound proteins were eluted by heating at 90 °C in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot. Purified recombinant His-CHIP (100 ng) was immobilized on a microtiter plate in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.6) at 4 °C. Non-reactive sites were blocked using PBS containing 3% BSA. A titration of the protein of interest was added in 1× Reaction Buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 2 mg/ml BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, binding was detected using anti-GST and HRP-tagged anti-mouse antibodies, and electrochemical luminescence was quantified using a luminometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Labsystems). For peptide competition assays, His-CHIP (100 ng) was preincubated with a titration of peptide (or DMSO control) in 1× reaction buffer for 10 min at room temperature, after which the mix was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with GST-IRF-1 (100 ng) immobilized on a microtiter plate as above. Washing and detection were as described above, except using anti-His mAb. For peptide binding assays, microtiter plates were coated with streptavidin (1 μg/well), following which enough biotin-tagged peptide to saturate the streptavidin (∼60 pmol) was added. Non-reactive sites were blocked using PBS containing 3% BSA as above. His-CHIP (25 ng) in 1× reaction buffer was added for 1 h at room temperature. Washing and detection were as above using anti-His mAb. In vitro ubiquitination assays were carried out essentially as previously described (23Wallace M. Worrall E. Pettersson S. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) except using 25 nm GST-IRF-1 (WT or mutant) as substrate. Reactions were started with His-CHIP (60–360 nm as indicated; usually 60 nm), incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and analyzed using 4–12% NuPAGE gels in a MOPS buffer system/immunoblot. In vivo ubiquitination assays were carried out as described (8Pion E. Narayan V. Eckert M. Ball K.L. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). His/Myc-CHIP (WT or mutant) was expressed in a TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The CHIP proteins were isolated using Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and washed extensively according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Mg2+-ATP washes were incorporated to remove any bound chaperones. Post washing, 5 μl of untagged IRF-1 (see “Plasmids and Protein Purification” for details) was added to the column and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Columns were then washed extensively with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were eluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot. Cells were seeded in a 96-well sterile black plate with a clear bottom (Costar) as required. In-Cell WesternTM assays were subsequently performed on a Licor Odyssey SA scanner according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-IRF-1 mAb (BD Biosciences) and anti-CHIP mAb (MBC3) were used at 1:500 and 1:50, respectively. The DNA stain (DRAQ5) was used as a control to normalize for cell number, as recommended by the manufacturer. Subcellular fractionation was carried out using the ProteoExtract kit (Calbiochem) or the subcellular protein fractionation kit (Thermo Scientific) as indicated, according to the manufacturer's instructions. We have previously shown that IRF-1 is polyubiquitinated and degraded via the proteasome and that the C terminus of IRF-1, which is required for the efficient ubiquitination of the protein, binds directly to the molecular chaperone Hsp70 (8Pion E. Narayan V. Eckert M. Ball K.L. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Narayan V. Eckert M. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25889-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Given that the outcome of Hsp70-substrate interactions is governed by a host of co-chaperones, we were interested in extending our previous study (21Narayan V. Eckert M. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25889-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in order to determine whether the co-chaperone and E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (24Tsai Y.C. Fishman P.S. Thakor N.V. Oyler G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22044-22055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) played a role in the regulation of IRF-1. When A375 cell lysate was passed through a column prepared by immobilizing GST-IRF-1 on glutathione-Sepharose beads, endogenous CHIP bound specifically to GST-IRF-1 and not to a GST alone control column (Fig. 1A). Additionally, CHIP was co-immunoprecipitated with IRF-1 from A375 cells in which both proteins were overexpressed (Fig. 1B). The above experiments suggest that CHIP and IRF-1 can form a complex; however, they do not address whether the proteins interact directly or whether additional factors, such as Hsp70, are required. In order to examine whether CHIP could bind IRF-1 in the absence of other factors, recombinant proteins purified from E. coli were used. When CHIP was immobilized on a microtiter well and incubated with IRF-1 that was in the mobile phase, it bound specifically to GST-IRF-1 but not GST alone (Fig. 1C). This shows that CHIP has the potential to bind directly to IRF-1 and that Hsp70 or other cellular factors are not required to mediate the interaction. Having established that CHIP can interact with IRF-1 in cells and in a cell-free environment, we sought to map the CHIP binding interface on IRF-1 using a library of biotin-tagged overlapping peptides spanning the entire length of the IRF-1 protein. When the peptides were immobilized on streptavidin-coated microtiter wells and incubated with purified CHIP, the CHIP bound stably to an Arg-Lys-Ser-rich region in the Mf2 (multifunctional 2) domain of IRF-1 (aa 106–140; Fig. 2A, peptides 8 and 9). In addition, CHIP bound to a lesser extent to a number of peptides from the DNA-binding domain of IRF-1 (Fig. 2A, peptides 1, 3, 4, 7). When the Mf2-derived peptide 9 was used in a competition assay to determine if it could reduce the binding of CHIP to full-length IRF-1, peptide 9, but not a control peptide, significantly inhibited CHIP·IRF-1 complex formation (Fig. 2B). The above data suggest that CHIP binds to a complex interface on IRF-1 and that a region from the IRF-1 Mf2 domain, aa 106–140, is sufficient to form a stable interaction and to partially compete with the full-length protein for binding to CHIP. To further establish a requirement for the Mf2 domain of IRF-1 in CHIP binding, a deletion mutant (IRF-1 Δ106–140) was generated and purified from E. coli. A comparison of CHIP binding to GST-tagged full-length and mutant IRF-1 showed a marked loss of binding to the mutant protein lacking the Arg-Lys-Ser motif (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2C (right) shows that the mutant and wild-type protein were normalized on the well. The fact that Mf2-derived peptides do not completely block IRF-1·CHIP complex formation (Fig. 2B) and that IRF-1 Δ106–140 retains partial CHIP binding activity supports the idea that the IRF-1·CHIP interface is complex, involving points of contact in the DNA-binding domain as well as the Mf2 region (Fig. 2A). Together, the results suggest a high affinity interaction between CHIP and aa 106–140 of IRF-1, with additional weaker contact sites in the IRF-1 DNA-binding domain. In order to identify the IRF-1 binding region of CHIP, a series of CHIP mutants lacking its functional domains were used (Fig. 3A) (25McDonough H. Charles P.C. Hilliard E.G. Qian S.B. Min J.N. Portbury A. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20649-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When the mutants were transfected into A375 cells together with IRF-1 and subjected to heat stress as described previously (25McDonough H. Charles P.C. Hilliard E.G. Qian S.B. Min J.N. Portbury A. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20649-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), both full-length CHIP (CHIP WT) and a CHIP mutant lacking the Hsp70 binding domain (CHIP ΔTPR) co-immunoprecipitated with IRF-1 (Fig. 3B, see lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, when either the charged domain (CHIP Δ±) or the U-Box (ΔUbox) was deleted, binding to IRF-1 was below the level of detection (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 8 and 14 with lanes 4, 6, and 12). However, the interpretation of the cell-based assays was complicated by the fact that, (i) different amounts of IRF-1 were pulled down in the presence of the various CHIP constructs, (ii) A375 cells express endogenous CHIP, and (iii) the ΔUbox CHIP mutant runs at the same size as the α-FLAG antibody light chain on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. CHIP has been shown to form dimers in vitro (12Nikolay R. Wiederkehr T. Rist W. Kramer G. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with the interface extending over the U-box and the charged domain (13Xu Z. Devlin K.I. Ford M.G. Nix J.C. Qin J. Misra S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas dimerization occurs independently of the TPR domain (12Nikolay R. Wiederkehr T. Rist W. Kramer G. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Xu Z. Devlin K.I. Ford M.G. Nix J.C. Qin J. Misra S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the data presented in Fig. 3B may reflect the ability of the various mutants to form complexes with endogenous CHIP and its associated proteins. To address our concerns, a cell-free assay was developed using CHIP constructs purified from a TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate expression system under conditions designed to remove Hsp70, and IRF-1 was generated using the Hsp70-free PURExpress system. All purified protein samples were shown to have Hsp70 levels that were below the levels of detection using immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Consistent with the data obtained using the cell-based assay, when IRF-1 was added to the various CHIP proteins immobilized on Ni2+-NTA agarose, it bound to both the WT and ΔTPR CHIP proteins but not Δ± and ΔUbox deletion mutants (Fig. 3C compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and 5). Together the data suggest that (i) IRF-1 binding does not require the TPR domain, (ii) IRF-1 and CHIP can interact independently of Hsp70 function (because Hsp70 cannot bind to the TPR domain mutant), and (iii) IRF-1 binding possibly requires both the charged and U-box domains of CHIP. In order to examine the effects of CHIP on IRF-1 in a cellular environment, A375 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-CHIP alone or pcDNA3-CHIP and pcDNA3-IRF-1 and then fractionated. Interestingly, when exogenous CHIP was present, high molecular weight IRF-1 proteins were detected in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, indicative of post-translational modification (Fig. 4A, panel 3, compare lanes 4 and 6 with lanes 1 and 3). To determine whether these high molecular weight bands represented ubiquitinated forms of IRF-1, a cell-based ubiquitination assay was utilized (8Pion E. Narayan V. Eckert M. Ball K.L. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). H1299 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-IRF-1, His-Ub, and pcDNA3-CHIP as indicated in Fig. 4B. In this assay, although endogenous E3 ligase activity is sufficient for IRF-1 modification, overexpression of CHIP results in a significant increase in the amount of ubiquitinated IRF-1 detected (Fig. 4B, His pulldown, compare lanes 2 and 3). These results demonstrate that CHIP-dependent ubiquitination of IRF-1 can occur in a complex cellular background. In order to determine if direct binding of CHIP to IRF-1 was sufficient to signal ubiquitination or whether additional cellular components, such as Hsp70, were required, a stopped enzyme assay using purified components was developed in which CHIP was rate-limiting (Fig. 5, A and B). Under these conditions, CHIP specifically ubiquitinates GST-IRF-1 but not GST alone (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 6–9 with lanes 2–5). To further dissect the IRF-1 ubiquitination pathway, we used a library of purified E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to determine which E2s could catalyze CHIP ubiquitination of IRF-1. Our data suggest that E2 enzymes belonging to the UbcH5 family and UbcH6 can cooperate with CHIP to efficiently ubiquitinate IRF-1 in vitro (Fig. 5C). As expected, mutation of the active site Cys (C85A) of the UbcH5 family members completely blocked IRF-1 ubiquitination by CHIP (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 6, 8, and 11 with lanes 5, 7, and 9). Additionally, when GST-IRF-1 (total protein, including ubiquitinated and unmodified IRF-1) was isolated from the ubiquitination reaction mix in which UbcH5a was used as the E2, immunoblot analysis showed that CHIP·UbcH5a can both monoubiquitinate and form polyubiquitin chains on IRF-1 (Fig. 5D). Moreover, CHIP·UbcH5a forms both Lys48-linked and Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains on IRF-1 because Ub mutants with either Lys48 or Lys63 mutated to Arg or with all lysine residues except Lys48 or Lys63 mutated to Arg cause no gross change in the pattern of IRF-1 modification by CHIP (Fig. 5E). The data presented above show that CHIP binds stably to IRF-1 aa 106–140 (Fig. 2A) and that CHIP can efficiently ubiquitinate IRF-1 both in cells and in vitro (Figs. 4B and 5B). However, the experiments do not demonstrate whether the direct binding of CHIP to the Mf2 domain is sufficient to signal ubiquitination of IRF-1. To address this question, we performed a series of cell-ba"

In this study, we identified annexin 2 as a regulator of endothelial morphogenesis using a three-dimensional in vitro model where sprouting angiogenesis was driven by sphingosine 1-phosphate and angiogenic growth factors. We observed that sphingosine 1-phosphate triggered annexin 2 translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and its association with vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. In addition, annexin 2 depletion attenuated Akt activation, which was associated with increased phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and endothelial barrier leakage. Disrupting homotypic VE-cadherin interactions with EGTA, antibodies to the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin, or gene silencing all resulted in decreased Akt (but not Erk1/2) activation. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active Akt restored reduced endothelial sprouting responses observed with annexin 2 and VE-cadherin knockdown. Collectively, we report that annexin 2 regulates endothelial morphogenesis through an adherens junction-mediated pathway upstream of Akt.

https://openalex.org/W1978249133,"Steady exposure to environmental arsenic has led to the evolution of vital cellular detoxification mechanisms. Under aerobic conditions, a two-step process appears most common among microorganisms involving reduction of predominant, oxidized arsenate (H2AsVO4−/HAsVO42−) to arsenite (AsIII(OH)3) by a cytosolic enzyme (ArsC; Escherichia coli type arsenate reductase) and subsequent extrusion via ArsB (E. coli type arsenite transporter)/ACR3 (yeast type arsenite transporter). Here, we describe novel fusion proteins consisting of an aquaglyceroporin-derived arsenite channel with a C-terminal arsenate reductase domain of phosphotyrosine-phosphatase origin, providing transposable, single gene-encoded arsenate resistance. The fusion occurred in actinobacteria from soil, Frankia alni, and marine environments, Salinispora tropica; Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes an analogous ACR3-ArsC fusion. Mutations rendered the aquaglyceroporin channel more polar resulting in lower glycerol permeability and enhanced arsenite selectivity. The arsenate reductase domain couples to thioredoxin and can complement arsenate-sensitive yeast strains. A second isoform with a nonfunctional channel may use the mycothiol/mycoredoxin cofactor pool. These channel enzymes constitute prototypes of a novel concept in metabolism in which a substrate is generated and compartmentalized by the same molecule. Immediate diffusion maintains the dynamic equilibrium and prevents toxic accumulation of metabolites in an energy-saving fashion.

https://openalex.org/W2035417694,"Serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1) is a multifunctional protein kinase that markedly influences various cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, glucose metabolism, and sodium (Na(+)) transport via the epithelial Na(+) channel, ENaC. SGK1 is a short-lived protein, which is predominantly targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to undergo rapid proteasome-mediated degradation through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) system. We show here that the aldosterone-induced chaperone, GILZ1 (glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein-1) selectively decreases SGK1 localization to ER as well as its interaction with ER-associated E3 ubiquitin ligases, HRD1 and CHIP. GILZ1 inhibits SGK1 ubiquitinylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby prolonging its half-life and increasing its steady-state expression. Furthermore, comparison of the effect of GILZ1 with that of proteasome inhibition (by MG-132) supports the idea that these effects of GILZ1 are secondary to physical interaction of GILZ1 with SGK1 and enhanced recruitment of SGK1 to targets within an ""ENaC regulatory complex,"" thus making less SGK1 available to the ERAD machinery. Finally, effects of GILZ1 knockdown and overexpression strongly support the idea that these effects of GILZ1 are functionally important for ENaC regulation. These data provide new insight into how the manifold activities of SGK1 are selectively deployed and strengthened through modulation of its molecular interactions, subcellular localization, and stability."
https://openalex.org/W2039961087,"Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) is the most recently identified phosphoinositide, and its functions have yet to be fully elucidated. Recently, members of our muscle group have shown that PI(3,5)P2 plays an important role in skeletal muscle function by altering Ca(2+) homeostasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that PI(3,5)P2 may also modulate cardiac muscle contractility by altering intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) in cardiac myocytes. We first confirmed that PI(3,5)P2 was present and increased by insulin treatment of cardiomyocytes via immunohistochemistry. To examine the acute effects of PI(3,5)P2 treatment, electrically paced left ventricular muscle strips were incubated with PI(3,5)P2. Treatment with PI(3,5)P2 increased the magnitude of isometric force, the rate of force development, and the area associated with the contractile waveforms. These enhanced contractile responses were also observed in MIP/Mtmr14(-/-) mouse hearts, which we found to have elevated levels of PI(3,5)P2. In cardiac myocytes loaded with fura-2, PI(3,5)P2 produced a robust elevation in [Ca(2+)](i). The PI(3,5)P2-induced elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) was not present in conditions free of extracellular Ca(2+) and was completely blocked by ryanodine. We investigated whether the phosphoinositide acted directly with the Ca(2+) release channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptors; RyR2). PI(3,5)P2 increased [(3)H]ryanodine binding and increased the open probability (P(o)) of single RyR2 channels reconstituted in lipid bilayers. This strongly suggests that the phosphoinositide binds directly to the RyR2 channel. Thus, we provide inaugural evidence that PI(3,5)P2 is a powerful activator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release and thereby modulates cardiac contractility."
https://openalex.org/W1978565972,"Dual oxidase (DUOX) enzymes support a wide variety of essential reactions, from cellular signaling to thyroid hormone biosynthesis. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the DUOX system (CeDUOX1/2) plays a crucial role in innate immunity and in stabilizing the cuticle by forming tyrosine cross-links. The current model suggests that superoxide generated by CeDUOX1 at the C-terminal NADPH oxidase domain is rapidly converted to H(2)O(2). The H(2)O(2) is then utilized by the N-terminal peroxidase-like domain to cross-link tyrosines. We have now created a series of mutations in the isolated peroxidase domain, CeDUOX1(1-589). One set of mutations investigate the roles of a putative distal tyrosine (Tyr(105)) and Glu(238), a proposed covalent heme-binding residue. The results confirm that Glu(238) covalently binds to the heme group. A second set of mutations (G246D and D392N) responsible for a C. elegans blistering cuticle phenotype was also investigated. Surprisingly, although not among the catalytic residues, both mutations affected heme co-factor binding. The G246D mutant bound less total heme than the wild type, but a higher fraction of it was covalently bound. In contrast, the D392N mutant appears to fold normally but does not bind heme. Molecular dynamics simulations of a CeDUOX1(1-589) homology model implicate displacements of the proximal histidine residue as the likely cause. Both enzymes are structurally stable and through altered heme interactions exhibit partial or complete loss of tyrosine cross-linking activity, explaining the blistering phenotype. This result argues that the CeDUOX peroxidase domain is primarily responsible for tyrosine cross-linking."
https://openalex.org/W2004124543,"Signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases regulates pancreatic β cell function. Inactivation of insulin receptor (InsR), IGF1 receptor (Igf1r), or Irs1 in β cells impairs insulin secretion. Conversely, Irs2 ablation impairs β cell replication. In this study, we examined aspects of the Igf1r regulatory signaling cascade in β cells. To examine genetically the involvement of Irs1 and Irs2 in Igf1r signaling, we generated double mutant mice lacking Igf1r specifically in pancreatic β cells in an Irs1- or Irs2-null background. We show that Igf1r/Irs1 double mutants do not differ phenotypically from Irs1 single mutants and exhibit hyperinsulinemia, while maintaining normal β cell mass and glucose tolerance. In contrast, lack of Igf1r function in β cells aggravates the consequences of Irs2 ablation in double mutants and results in lethal diabetes by 6 weeks of age. This additivity of phenotypic manifestations indicates that Irs2 serves a pathway that is largely independent of Igf1r signaling. Consistent with the view that the latter is the InsR pathway, we show that combined β cell-specific knock-out of both Insr and Igf1r results in a phenocopy of double mutants lacking Igf1r and Irs2. We conclude that Igf1r signals primarily through Irs1 and affects insulin secretion, whereas β cell proliferation is mainly regulated by InsR using Irs2 as a downstream signaling effector. The insulin and IGF pathways appear to control β cell functions independently and selectively."

Passive Heymann nephritis is an experimental model that mimics membranous nephropathy in humans, wherein the glomerular epithelial cell (GEC) injury induced by complement C5b-9 leads to proteinuria. We examined the role of cytochrome P450 2B1 (CYP2B1) in this complement-mediated sublytic injury. Overexpression of CYP2B1 in GECs significantly increased the formation of reactive oxygen species, cytotoxicity, and collapse of the actin cytoskeleton following treatment with anti-tubular brush-border antiserum (anti-Fx1A). In contrast, silencing of CYP2B1 markedly attenuated anti-Fx1A-induced reactive oxygen species generation and cytotoxicity with preservation of the actin cytoskeleton. Gelsolin, which maintains an organized actin cytoskeleton, was significantly decreased by complement C5b-9-mediated injury but was preserved in CYP2B1-silenced cells. In rats injected with anti-Fx1A, the cytochrome P450 inhibitor cimetidine blocked an increase in catalytic iron and ROS generation, reduced the formation of malondialdehyde adducts, maintained a normal distribution of nephrin in the glomeruli, and provided significant protection at the onset of proteinuria.

https://openalex.org/W1999592784,"The results of our in vitro experiments indicate that exposing cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells and dermal fibroblasts to 39 to 41 °C induces a significant up-regulation in the net deposition of elastic fibers, but not of collagen I or fibronectin, and also decreases the deposition of chondroitin sulfate-containing moieties. We further demonstrate that mild hyperthermia also rectifies the insufficient elastogenesis notable in cultures of fibroblasts derived from the stretch-marked skin of adult patients and in cultures of dermal fibroblasts from children with Costello syndrome, which is characterized by the accumulation of chondroitin 6-sulfate glycosaminoglycans that induce shedding and inactivation of the 67-kDa elastin-binding protein. We have previously established that this protein serves as a reusable chaperone for tropoelastin and that its recycling is essential for the normal deposition of elastic fibers. We now report that hyperthermia not only inhibits deposition of chondroitin 6-sulfate moieties and the consequent preservation of elastin-binding protein molecules but also induces their faster recycling. This, in turn, triggers a more efficient preservation of tropoelastin, enhancement of its secretion and extracellular assembly into elastic fibers. The presented results encourage using mild hyperthermia to restore elastic fiber production in damaged adult skin and to enhance elastogenesis in children with genetic elastinopathies."
