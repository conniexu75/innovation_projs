https://openalex.org/W3023639742,"Data saturation is the most commonly employed concept for estimating sample sizes in qualitative research. Over the past 20 years, scholars using both empirical research and mathematical/statistical models have made significant contributions to the question: How many qualitative interviews are enough? This body of work has advanced the evidence base for sample size estimation in qualitative inquiry during the design phase of a study, prior to data collection, but it does not provide qualitative researchers with a simple and reliable way to determine the adequacy of sample sizes during and/or after data collection. Using the principle of saturation as a foundation, we describe and validate a simple-to-apply method for assessing and reporting on saturation in the context of inductive thematic analyses. Following a review of the empirical research on data saturation and sample size estimation in qualitative research, we propose an alternative way to evaluate saturation that overcomes the shortcomings and challenges associated with existing methods identified in our review. Our approach includes three primary elements in its calculation and assessment: Base Size, Run Length, and New Information Threshold. We additionally propose a more flexible approach to reporting saturation. To validate our method, we use a bootstrapping technique on three existing thematically coded qualitative datasets generated from in-depth interviews. Results from this analysis indicate the method we propose to assess and report on saturation is feasible and congruent with findings from earlier studies."
https://openalex.org/W3023622052,"Overexpression of centromeric proteins has been identified in a number of human malignancies, but the functional and mechanistic contributions of these proteins to disease progression have not been characterized. The centromeric histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENPA) is an epigenetic mark that determines centromere identity. Here, using an array of approaches, including RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing analyses, immunohistochemistry-based tissue microarrays, and various cell biology assays, we demonstrate that CENPA is highly overexpressed in prostate cancer in both tissue and cell lines and that the level of CENPA expression correlates with the disease stage in a large cohort of patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments confirmed that CENPA promotes prostate cancer cell line growth. The results from the integrated sequencing experiments suggested a previously unidentified function of CENPA as a transcriptional regulator that modulates expression of critical proliferation, cell-cycle, and centromere/kinetochore genes. Taken together, our findings show that CENPA overexpression is crucial to prostate cancer growth.

Located centric to the ends of each chromosome, centromeres provide the structural foundation for kinetochores, multimeric complexes that serve as molecular interfaces between microtubule spindle fibers and individual chromatids during mitosis (1Cleveland D.W.

The centromere–kinetochore–microtubule interaction facilitates separation of the sister chromatids as mitosis proceeds from metaphase to anaphase. Centromeres are thus essential to ensuring faithful segregation of chromosomes in actively dividing cells. Efforts to study human centromeres have focused on the epigenetics that drive centromere assembly (3Hayashi T. Fujita Y. Iwasaki O. Adachi Y. Takahashi K. Yanagida M.

Proper CENPA localization is an ubiquitin E3 ligase–dependent process requiring ubiquitination of lysine 124 for engagement with the CENPA-specific chaperone HJURP (7Niikura Y. Kitagawa R. Ogi H.

CENPA nucleosomes have a unique set of binding partners that facilitate proper genomic localization, including CENPB, CENPC, and the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) that comprises the inner kinetochore (10Falk S.J.

The CCAN serves as a multimeric interface between the DNA-enveloped CENPA nucleosomes and the KNL-1–Mis12–Ndc80 complex network that comprises the outer kinetochore and directly interacts with the microtubule spindle fibers (12Schleiffer A.

CENPA and its associated proteins therefore represent structural components that are essential to the integrity of cell division, and appropriate genomic localization of centromeric proteins is consequently a critical event in the cell cycle. Diseases of uncontrolled cell division, particularly cancer, are thus compelling to examine from the epigenetic perspective of centromere biology, primarily as it pertains to the key epigenetic mark CENPA. A number of studies have identified aberrant expression of centromeric/kinetochore proteins in cancers, where overexpression is predictive of survival and response to therapy, although their mechanistic contribution to cancer pathogenesis remains elusive (13Thiru P.

In the setting of ectopic constitutive overexpression, CENPA mislocalization in HeLa cells is independent of aberrant E3 ligase activity but rather demonstrates a reliance on the histone chaperone DAXX (25Lacoste N.

Ectopic localization of endogenously overexpressed CENPA has also been shown in colon cancer cell lines (26Athwal R.K. Walkiewicz M.P. Baek S. Fu S. Bui M. Camps J. Ried T. Sung M.-H. Dalal Y. CENP-A nucleosomes localize to transcription factor hotspots and subtelomeric sites in human cancer cells.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2015; 8 (25788983): 210.1186/1756-8935-8-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The phenotypic consequences of such mislocalization in malignancy have yet to be elucidated, although ectopic binding to sites marked by DNase hypersensitivity and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) transcription factor affinity has hinted at a potential role in regulating gene transcription (25Lacoste N. Woolfe A. Tachiwana H. Garea A.V. Barth T. Cantaloube S. Kurumizaka H. Imhof A. Almouzni G.

Here we report that CENPA is highly overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCA) and that disease progression correlates with CENPA expression within a large patient cohort. CENPA knockdown markedly decreases proliferation of prostate cancer cells but not that of benign prostate cells and increased expression of CENPA causes benign prostate epithelial cells to proliferate more rapidly. Interestingly, CENPA appears to affect proliferation of prostate cancer cells by acting as a transcriptional regulator that modulates expression of genes critical to proliferation, cell cycle progression, and centromere/kinetochore integrity in addition to its role in the centromere. The significance of centromeres to cell division suggests that centromeric components may play important roles in development and in diseases involving cell division gone awry, particularly in cancer. Previous work identified a centromere-kinetochore (CEN/KT) signature that was associated with aggressive, treatment-refractory malignancy (16Zhang W. Mao J.-H. Zhu W. Jain A.K. Liu K. Brown J.B. Karpen G.H. Centromere and kinetochore gene misexpression predicts cancer patient survival and response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27577169): 1261910.1038/ncomms12619Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We therefore profiled the transcriptomes of different types of malignancies across a compiled catalogue of publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) databases (n = 10,848) (27Iyer M.K. Niknafs Y.S. Malik R. Singhal U. Sahu A. Hosono Y. Barrette T.R. Prensner J.R. Evans J.R. Zhao S. Poliakov A. Cao X. Dhanasekaran S.M. Wu Y.-M.

We found that CENPA is ubiquitously overexpressed in malignant tissue relative to respective normal counterparts (Fig. S1A and Table S1). These observations, combined with the well-characterized contributions of centromeric components like CENPA to cell division, suggested conducting a more focused interrogation of these components in cancers that display poor prognosis in the context of high proliferation indices. Prostate cancer is one such disease, where a high proliferation index is predictive of poor outcomes (28Fisher G. Yang Z.H. Kudahetti S. Møller H. Scardino P. Cuzick J. Berney D.M. Transatlantic Prostate Group Prognostic value of Ki-67 for prostate cancer death in a conservatively managed cohort.Br. J.

New treatment strategies are much needed for prostate cancer, which remains the most diagnosed malignancy in men and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men (30American Cancer Society Cancer Facts & Figures (2018) https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/cancer-facts-figures-2018.html (accessed June 4, 2018).Google Scholar). Although hormonal therapy and chemotherapeutic options are available, resistant metastatic disease and life-altering side effects, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, are everlasting concerns (31Cooperberg M.R. Prostate cancer: a new look at prostate cancer treatment complications.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2014; 11 (24687033): 304-30510.1038/nrclinonc.2014.58Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In view of the above considerations, we performed sample set enrichment analysis (SSEA) in the prostate tissue type cohort containing RNA-seq data from 685 tissue samples (27Iyer M.K. Niknafs Y.S. Malik R. Singhal U. Sahu A. Hosono Y. Barrette T.R. Prensner J.R. Evans J.R. Zhao S. Poliakov A. Cao X. Dhanasekaran S.M. Wu Y.-M. Robinson D.R. et al.The landscape of long noncoding RNAs in the human transcriptome.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 (25599403): 199-20810.1038/ng.3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Gene expression of numerous centromeric components exhibited strong enrichments in prostate cancer tissue relative to their normal counterparts (Fig. 1A and Table S2). Our analysis corroborates on a significantly greater scale previous reports that characterize some of these components as part of the centromere-kinetochore (CEN/KT) signature that is strongly associated with poor disease outcomes (16Zhang W. Mao J.-H. Zhu W. Jain A.K. Liu K. Brown J.B. Karpen G.H. Centromere and kinetochore gene misexpression predicts cancer patient survival and response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27577169): 1261910.1038/ncomms12619Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We selected CENPA from this panel of genes for further assessment, given its central role in centromere biology, importance for development, and highly conserved function, and found a significant increase in expression with disease progression (Fig. 1B) (32Smith C.L. Blake J.A. Kadin J.A. Richardson J.E. Bult C.J. Mouse Genome Database Group Mouse Genome Database (MGD)-2018: knowledgebase for the laboratory mouse.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29092072): D836-D84210.1093/nar/gkx1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This in silico finding was validated at the protein level through prostate tissue microarrays stained for CENPA, notably demonstrating marked overexpression of CENPA that increased with disease severity (n = 58 total tissues, n = 174 cores) (Fig. 1C). Importantly, receiver operator characteristic analysis of the CENPA-stained prostate tissue microarray produced an area under the curve of 0.89, orthogonally demonstrating a strong association between elevated CENPA expression and metastatic prostate cancer (Fig. S1B). Assessment of CENPA expression was also examined in cancer cell line models to determine feasibility for more focused molecular inquiry. We verified robust overexpression of CENPA in prostate cancer cell lines, as compared with benign prostatic epithelial lines (Fig. 1D). The PNT2 benign cell line was a notable exception, likely because of its rapid proliferation rate relative to other cell lines we tested (Fig. S1C). Taken together, CENPA is a functionally conserved, developmentally important factor abundant in prostate cancer tissue, as seen in a large number of patients and in prostate cancer cell lines, and an increase in its expression at the RNA and protein levels is highly correlated with more aggressive disease. The abundance of CENPA in prostate cancer raised the question of whether overexpression plays a functional role in disease pathogenesis and progression. We thus first conducted a comparative analysis of CENPA expression relative to the remaining transcriptome in prostate cancer to identify associations with biological concepts that could computationally guide functional assessments. Our efforts to profile transcriptomes in human cancer and normal tissue facilitates performing transcriptome-wide correlations against nominated genes of interest in a tissue-specific manner within a large catalogue of samples (n = 685). We thus correlated CENPA mRNA levels to the expression levels of all other protein coding elements (Data Set S1) to deconvolute its relative contribution to prostate cancer progression. CENPA expression tracks tightly with a number of previously identified prostate cancer pathogenesis factors including CENPF, UBE2C, and EZH2 (Fig. 2A; Fig. S2, C and D; and Data Set S1). MKI67 (gene encoding proliferation marker Ki67) also performed well in our analysis, further suggesting a role for CENPA in cellular proliferation (Fig. 2B). Of note, CENPA does not tightly correlate with ACTB (housekeeping gene), AMACR (prostate cancer biomarker), or AR (Fig. S2, A and B, and Data Set S1), suggesting a pathogenic process that is independent of androgen signaling, a pharmacologically relevant molecular pathway that is frequently targeted in prostate cancer treatment. Strong associations with cellular proliferation genes and select pathogenesis factors independent of AR implicate CENPA as a contributor to a biological process that is involved in androgen refractory prostate cancer progression. In fact, we found that AR signaling actually represses CENPA expression in cell culture (Fig. S3A). We additionally used the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to conduct ontology assessments on the highest-performing genes from our transcriptome-wide correlation against CENPA expression in prostate cancer (r > 0.8) (33Huang D.W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 (19131956): 44-5710.1038/nprot.2008.211Crossref PubMed Scopus (25346) Google Scholar). Our analysis revealed a correlation between CENPA gene expression and biological concept clusters that highlight centromeres, kinetochores, mitosis, and cell division (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3B). Concepts that include genes encoding components of the CCAN were additionally captured by our analysis. Of note, CDC25C, CDCA5, TOP2A, and CENPU, genes known to play roles in cellular proliferation, cell cycle progression, and centromere/kinetochore integrity, were included in these biological concepts. Preranked gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) independently confirmed enrichments in gene signatures important for cell cycle, cell division, and mitosis (Fig. 2D and Fig. S3C). Taken together, CENPA expression is strongly linked to gene signatures that underlie processes that govern proliferation, cell cycle progression, and centromere/kinetochore integrity in prostate cancer. Significant association between CENPA and proliferation signatures is expected given the role CENPA plays in the structural integrity of the centromere. There is limited evidence, however, concerning CENPA function in human malignancy. We therefore performed loss-of- and gain-of-function experiments in cell lines stably expressing either doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNAs against CENPA or EF1A promoter–driven full-length CENPA. Doxycycline administration at 2 μg/ml was sufficient to produce robust knockdown of CENPA after 72 h (Fig. 3A and Fig. S4, A and B). CENPA depletion led to a profound growth-inhibitory effect on 22Rv1, LnCaP, and DU145 prostate cancer cells (Fig. 3, B–D, and Fig. S4, C and D). CENPA depletion in prostate cancer cells results in an accumulation of cells in G1 that seem to be unable to progress through the cell cycle (Fig. 3E and Fig. S4, E and F). Conversely, overexpression of CENPA in the 957E-hTERT benign prostate epithelial cell line leads to a profound growth-promoting effect (Fig. 3, F and G). Interestingly, benign 957E-hTERT cells depleted of CENPA do not demonstrate significant proliferative changes, consistent with previous reports that nonmalignant cells can proliferate with low levels of CENPA (Fig. 3G) (34Black B.E.

Taken together, our data show that CENPA is an essential factor for progression through the cell cycle and that overexpression drives proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Given prior reports of ectopic deposition in the setting of CENPA overexpression and the marked overexpression of CENPA in prostate cancer, we performed native ChIP followed by sequencing to identify noncentromeric and potentially regulatory binding sites for CENPA in prostate cancer. As expected, four α-satellites were enriched relative to the IgG control antibodies using a PCR assay we previously devised that can distinguish chromosome-specific α-satellite DNA from any given centromere, verifying the validity of the CENPA ChIP (Fig. S5A) (35Contreras-Galindo R.

CENPA-directed ChIP-seq identified 569 noncentromeric binding sites in the VCaP prostate cancer cell line within three experimental replicates (Fig. 4A; Fig. S5, C and D; and Data Set S2). One example of such a CENPA-binding site is present in the promoter region of CDC25C (Fig. 4B), a cell cycle phosphatase that is critical for progression through anaphase that was also identified in our comparative gene expression analysis described above (Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, the promoter of CENPA itself was also bound by CENPA, consistent with previously reported results, hinting that CENPA might regulate its own transcription (26Athwal R.K. Walkiewicz M.P. Baek S. Fu S. Bui M. Camps J. Ried T. Sung M.-H. Dalal Y. CENP-A nucleosomes localize to transcription factor hotspots and subtelomeric sites in human cancer cells.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2015; 8 (25788983): 210.1186/1756-8935-8-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CENPA-directed ChIP was additionally conducted in the benign prostatic epithelial cell line 957E-hTERT to determine whether ectopic CENPA binding is a cancer-specific observation (Fig. S5B). CENPA enrichment over the four previously assessed α-satellites was significantly lower than that observed in the VCaP cell line, consistent with each cell line's respective CENPA abundance observed above (Fig. 1D). CENPA-directed ChIP-seq for the 957E-hTERT cell line was thus deferred. We next conducted a global assessment of CENPA-binding sites to obtain a functional taxonomy of CENPA-bound genes. Ontologic assessment of genes whose transcriptional start sites were in close proximity to CENPA-binding sites revealed enrichments in biological concepts that are involved with maintenance of nuclear architecture and organization, such as protein–DNA complex assembly (p = 6.44 × 10−18) and chromosome organization (p = 8.70 × 10−13) (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, binning CENPA-binding sites into categories corresponding to discreet locations within the human genome demonstrates a predilection toward binding regulatory elements such as promoters and CpG islands (Fig. 4D). Comparing the number of peaks present within any two genomic regions reveals significant overlap between loci considered to be regulatory areas (Fig. S5E). Taken together, we show that CENPA localizes to noncanonical genomic loci, with a predilection toward the regulatory elements of genes that control cellular proliferation. Histone variants have been well-characterized as modulators of aberrant gene expression in cancer. H2A.Z.2, macroH2A, and H3.3 are well-documented as key contributors to malignant phenotypes in a number of cancer types (36Sporn J.C. Kustatscher G. Hothorn T. Collado M. Serrano M. Muley T.

https://openalex.org/W3021677779,"During social transmission of food preference (STFP), the combination of an olfactory sensory input with a social cue induces long-term memory of a food odor. How a social cue produces long-term learning of an olfactory input, however, remains unknown. Here we show that the neurons of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), which form abundant synaptic projections onto granule cells in the olfactory bulb (OB), express the synaptogenic molecule C1ql3. Deletion of C1ql3 in the dorsolateral AON impaired synaptic AON→OB connections and abolished acquisition, but not recall, of STFP memory without significantly affecting basal olfaction. Moreover, deletion in granule cells of the OB of Bai3, a postsynaptic GPCR that binds C1ql3, similarly suppressed synaptic transmission at AON→OB projections and abolished acquisition, but not recall, of STFP memory. Thus, synaptic AON→OB connections are selectively required for STFP memory acquisition and are formed by an essential interaction of presynaptic C1ql3 with postsynaptic Bai3."
https://openalex.org/W3021215520,"Unimolecular dual agonists of the glucagon (GCG) receptor (GCGR) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) are a new class of drugs that are potentially superior to GLP-1R–specific agonists for the management of metabolic disease. The dual-agonist, peptide 15 (P15), is a glutamic acid 16 analog of GCG with GLP-1 peptide substitutions between amino acids 17 and 24 that has potency equivalent to those of the cognate peptide agonists at the GCGR and GLP-1R. Here, we have used cryo-EM to solve the structure of an active P15-GCGR-Gs complex and compared this structure to our recently published structure of the GCGR-Gs complex bound to GCG. This comparison revealed that P15 has a reduced interaction with the first extracellular loop (ECL1) and the top of transmembrane segment 1 (TM1) such that there is increased mobility of the GCGR extracellular domain and at the C terminus of the peptide compared with the GCG-bound receptor. We also observed a distinct conformation of ECL3 and could infer increased mobility of the far N-terminal His-1 residue in the P15-bound structure. These regions of conformational variance in the two peptide-bound GCGR structures were also regions that were distinct between GCGR structures and previously published peptide-bound structures of the GLP-1R, suggesting that greater conformational dynamics may contribute to the increased efficacy of P15 in activation of the GLP-1R compared with GCG. The variable domains in this receptor have previously been implicated in biased agonism at the GLP-1R and could result in altered signaling of P15 at the GCGR compared with GCG."

Mitochondrial rRNAs (mt-rRNAs) undergo a series of nucleotide modifications after release from polycistronic mitochondrial RNA precursors, which is essential for mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis. Cytosine N4-methylation (m4C) at position 839 (m4C839) of the 12S small subunit mt-rRNA was identified decades ago; however, its biogenesis and function have not been elucidated in detail. Here, using several approaches, including immunofluorescence, RNA immunoprecipitation and methylation assays, and bisulfite mapping, we demonstrate that human methyltransferase-like 15 (METTL15), encoded by a nuclear gene, is responsible for 12S mt-rRNA methylation at m4C839 both in vivo and in vitro. We tracked the evolutionary history of RNA m4C methyltransferases and identified a difference in substrate preference between METTL15 and its bacterial ortholog rsmH. Additionally, unlike the very modest impact of a loss of m4C methylation in bacterial small subunit rRNA on the ribosome, we found that METTL15 depletion results in impaired translation of mitochondrial protein-coding mRNAs and decreases mitochondrial respiration capacity.

Mitochondrial diseases may be caused by mutations in mtDNA (12Taylor R.W. Turnbull D.M. Mitochondrial DNA mutations in human disease.Nat. Rev.

For instance, loss of TFB1M results in mitochondrial dysfunction that leads to impaired insulin secretion and diabetes (13Sharoyko V.V. Abels M. Sun J. Nicholas L.M. Mollet I.G. Stamenkovic J.A.

A missense mutation in pseudouridylate synthase 1 (PUS1), which converts uridine to pseudouridine at several mitochondrial tRNA positions, has been reported to be associated with myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (14Fernandez-Vizarra E.

Moreover, a defect in the mitochondrial rRNA methyltransferase MRM2 that causes loss of 2′-O-methyl modification at position U1369 in the human mitochondrial 16S rRNA leads to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like clinical syndrome in patients (15Garone C.

In addition, a 11p14.1 microdeletion was identified to be highly associated with attention-deficit/hyperreactive disorder, autism, developmental delay, and obesity (16Shinawi M. Sahoo T. Maranda B.

Genet. A. 2011; 155: 1272-128010.1002/ajmg.a.33878Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the microdeletion region always encompasses the METTL-family protein METTL15. More recently, a transancestral meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies uncovered a completely novel SNP (rs10835310) in METTL15 associated with childhood obesity (17Bradfield J.P. Vogelezang S. Felix J.F. Chesi A. Helgeland Ø. Horikoshi M. Karhunen V. Lowry E. Cousminer D.L. Ahluwalia T.S. Thiering E. Boh E.T. Zafarmand M.H. Vilor-Tejedor N.

In this current study, we demonstrate that human METTL15 protein, encoded by a nuclear gene, is localized in mitochondria and is responsible for methylation of the 12S mt-RNA at C839 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that METTL15-dependent modification of 12S mt-rRNA is necessary for the proper function of mitoribosome. Our study reveals that methylation of 12S mt-rRNA m4C839 by METTL15 is an important epitranscriptomic modification, critical for efficient mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiratory function. METTL15 is a member of the methyltransferase like (METTL) family, characterized by the presence of a binding domain for SAM, which is a methyl-group donor for methylation reactions (18Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Many paths to methyltransfer: a chronicle of convergence.Trends Biochem.

Through phylogenetic analysis, we found that METTL15 is highly conserved during evolution and is an ortholog of the bacterial methyltransferase, rsmH (Fig. 1A and Data File S1), which is responsible for the N4-methylation of m4Cm1402 in the 16S rRNA in almost all species of bacteria (Fig. S1A) (20Kimura S. Suzuki T. Fine-tuning of the ribosomal decoding center by conserved methyl-modifications in the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 (19965768): 1341-135210.1093/nar/gkp1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Given its similarity with rsmH (Fig. 1A and Data File S1), we asked whether METTL15 is also a m4Cm methyltransferase for rRNA. We first purified the SSU rRNA fragments containing C1402 or its equivalent nucleotide from four representative species and measured the levels of m4Cm by HPLC-MS/MS. We did not detect any meaningful levels of m4Cm in the cytoplasmic SSU rRNAs from fruit fly, zebrafish, or human; however, a varied but significant amount of Cm was readily detectable (Fig. S1B). This finding is consistent with previous reports that the SSU rRNAs of those eukaryotic cells were abundantly modified by 2′-O-methylated cytosine (Fig. S1C) (21Decatur W.A. Fournier M.J. rRNA modifications and ribosome function.Trends Biochem.

In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria has its own ribosomes translating mitochondrial mRNAs, which prompted us to investigate whether METTL15 is a mitoribosome-specific methyltransferase. Indeed, a considerable amount of mitochondrial genome-encoded RNAs, especially 12S and 16S mt-rRNA, but not cytoplasmic RNAs such as 18S rRNAs, are found to be associated with the HA-tagged METTL15 in an RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiment (Fig. 1B). Consistently, immunofluoresence experiments showed that METTL15 is exclusively localized in the mitochondria, which depends on its putative mitochondria-targeting signals (Fig. 1C) (22Fukasawa Y. Tsuji J. Fu S.C. Tomii K. Horton P. Imai K. MitoFates: improved prediction of mitochondrial targeting sequences and their cleavage sites.Mol Cell.

To unambiguously identify the in vivo methylation sites modified by METTL15, we profiled the mitochondrial RNA methylome in WT and METTL15 knockout (KO) cells using RNA bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq), which detects both m5C and m4C cytosine modifications in RNAs (23Schaefer M. Pollex T. Hanna K. Lyko F. RNA cytosine methylation analysis by bisulfite sequencing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 37 (19059995): e1210.1093/nar/gkn954Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The RNA BS-seq revealed that in the absence of METTL15, the methylation level of 12S mt-C839 is drastically decreased from 58% to a near background level (0.9%), which suggests that methylation of 12S mt-C839 may be mediated by METTL15 (Fig. 2, A and B). To validate the BS-seq results, we designed sequence-specific primers to amplify a 145-nucleotide region surrounding C839 from bisulfite-treated RNA samples and employed targeted sequencing (detailed procedures can be found under “Experimental procedures”) to examine the methylation levels of C839. In agreement with the BS-seq result, methylation of C839 was found to almost completely disappear in the METTL15 KO cells (Fig. S2C). Importantly, the methylation level of m4C839 can be fully rescued by WT METTL15 but not a catalytically compromised mutant METTL15 (GA mutant: 108GSGG112 to 108ASAA112) (Fig. S2C) (24Kozbial P.Z. Mushegian A.R. Natural history of S-adenosylmethionine–binding proteins.BMC Struct. Biol. 2005; 5 (16225687): 1910.1186/1472-6807-5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which strongly supports the hypothesis that METTL15 is responsible for m4C839 on 12S mt-rRNA in vivo and is consistent with a very recent study (25Haute L.V.

Interestingly, the neighboring methylation site, m5C841, which is catalyzed by NSUN4 (9), is also reduced (but not eliminated) upon METTL15 deletion. In addition, the m5C841 reduction could be fully restored by reintroducing WT METTL15 and partially restored by enzymatically inactive METTL15, suggesting that METTL15 might influence the installation of m5C841 by NSUN4 in both enzymatic activity–dependent and –independent manners (Fig. S2C). Given that both m4C(m) and m5C are able to block the C-to-T transition by bisulfite treatment and therefore cannot be distinguished in the BS-seq analysis (23Schaefer M. Pollex T. Hanna K. Lyko F. RNA cytosine methylation analysis by bisulfite sequencing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 37 (19059995): e1210.1093/nar/gkn954Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we turned to an optimized LC–MS/MS method to efficiently separate different forms of methyl cytosines to define the exact type of methylation in C839 (Fig. S2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, m4C was detected in WT cell lines but reduced to a background level in the METTL15 KO cells, indicating that METTL15 may be a m4C methyltransferase for C839. Consistent with the BS-seq data, HPLC-MS/MS analysis also found a modest reduction of m5C at C841 caused by METTL15 depletion, which again points to a potential cross-talk between C839 and C841 methylation. m4C methylation of C839 is mediated by the intrinsic enzymatic activity of METTL15 because reintroduction of WT, but not the catalytically inactive METLL15, back into the METTL15 KO cells restored the methylation level of m4C839 (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2, A–C). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that METTL15 is likely the enzyme responsible for methylation of 12S mt-m4C839 in vivo (Fig. S2D). We next asked whether recombinant METTL15 mediates 12S mt-rRNA methylation at C839. C-terminally FLAG-tagged METTL15 was expressed in 293T cells and purified using an anti-FLAG M2 affinity column (Fig. S3A). Recombinant METTL15 was incubated with 12S mt-rRNA oligonucleotides (nucleotides 832–846) in the presence of d3-SAM (S-(5′-adenosyl)-l-methionine-d3) as a methyl group donor, and the resulting rRNAs oligonucleotides were isolated for LC–MS measurement. As shown in Fig. 3A, m4 methylation of C839 was successfully detected, whereas the catalytically compromised METTL15 failed to mediate C839 methylation. As described before, a main difference between the m4C methylation site of bacterial ribosome and human mitoribosome is that cytosine in bacterial ribosome is mainly m4Cm, whereas in the human mitoribosome at the equivalent cytosine residue, it is m4C without the 2′-O-methylation. This prompted us to determine whether human METTL15 displays any preference for unmodified cytosine versus 2′-O-methylated cytosine. Consistently, unmodified cytosine in the 12S mt-rRNA appears to be a better substrate for human METT15 in vitro (C versus Cm in Fig. 3B). In contrast, rsmH shows a higher apparent activity toward Cm compared with C of 12S mt-rRNAs (solid line in Fig. 3C; Fig. S3C). Interestingly, we found the aromatic amino acid (Trp173) in rsmH, which has been changed to valine (Val242) in the eukaryotic orthologs (METTL15) and might potentially mediate the interaction of 2′-O-methyl group of Cm with rsmH based on the published rsmH structure (Fig. S3B) (26Wei Y. Zhang H. Gao Z.Q. Wang W.J. Shtykova E.V. Xu J.H. Liu Q.S. Dong Y.H. Crystal and solution structures of methyltransferase RsmH provide basis for methylation of C1402 in 16S rRNA.J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 179 (22561317): 29-4010.1016/j.jsb.2012.04.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results confirmed that human METTL15 is a bona fide m4C methyltransferase and has a higher activity toward unmodified cytosine than 2′-O-methylated cytosine in vitro. Because METTL15 is localized in mitochondria, we first investigated the effect of METTL15 deletion on mtDNA copy number and transcription of mitochondrial genome-encoded genes. We found METTL15 deletion only causes minor changes of mtDNA copy number and transcription (Fig. S4, A and B). Given that the methylation site lies in the critical region of the mitoribosome, we next asked whether loss of METTL15 affects the function of mitoribosome. We performed mitochondrial ribosome profiling in a 10–30% sucrose gradient to determine whether there was any difference in the assembly of mitoribosome. The distribution of SSU and large subunit in the sucrose gradient was detected by the presence of 12S and 16S mt-rRNA, respectively. According to the protein complex density, the first peak of 12S rRNA (fraction 8) represents SSU, whereas the first peak of 16S rRNA (fraction 9) represents large the subunit, and the co-fractionated peaks (fractions 12 and 13) represent the mature ribosome. The co-fractionation ratio of 12S and 16S mt-rRNAs in METTL15 KO cells was significantly reduced (compared with factions 12 and 13 in WT cells), thus identifying a major defect in mitoribosome assembly. In addition, the ratio of mRNA encoded by mitochondrial genome was also significantly reduced in the 55S mature monosomes (fractions 12 and 13), indicating compromised translation efficiency, which was consistent with the observed mitoribosome assembly defects (Fig. 4, A–C). Western blotting results of two representative mitochondrial protein-coding genes, COX2 and ND6, showed that the levels of the protein products were also reduced significantly (Fig. S4C and Fig. 4, D and E). Importantly, the translational defects of multiple mitochondria-encoded genes could be rescued by WT METTL15 but not the catalytic mutant (Fig. S4D), suggesting that the impact of METTL15 on mitoribosome is likely to be dependent on N4-methylation of C839. These data thus demonstrate that the methylation mediated by METTL15 is important for the proper function of mitoribosomes and mt-mRNA translation. The most prominent role of mitochondria is to produce ATP through respiration and to regulate cellular metabolism. Most of the ATP synthesized during glucose metabolism is produced in the mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) powered by the electron transport chain complex, which consists essentially of ∼70 nuclear-encoded proteins and 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins translated by mitoribosome in mitochondria. To determine the impact of METTL15 loss on respiratory activity, we measured the respiratory activity of METTL15 KO cells using a Seahorse XF96 analyzer. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of the METTL15 KO cells was substantially lower than that of WT cells, and this effect depends on the enzymatic activity (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that METTL15-mediated m4C839 on 12S mt-rRNA is likely to be required for proper oxidative phosphorylation function. After 2 days in culture, the medium of METTL15 KO cells turned yellower, indicating a lower pH and more lactate secretion, although the cell numbers are comparable between WT and KO (Fig. S5A). Consistently, the extracellular acidification rate, which approximates glycolytic activity, was significantly up-regulated in the METTL15 KO cells, likely to compensate for dysfunction of the mitochondria (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, metabolites profiling shows a decline of citrate and α-ketoglutarate, the intermediates of the TCA cycle, which is closely coupled with OxPhos to generate ATP. It is also known that an essential function of respiration in proliferating cells is to support aspartate biosynthesis (27Sullivan L.B. Gui D.Y. Hosios A.M. Bush L.N. Freinkman E. Vander Heiden M.G. Supporting aspartate biosynthesis is an essential function of respiration in proliferating cells.Cell. 2015; 162 (26232225): 552-56310.1016/j.cell.2015.07.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 28Wang T.

The decline of the aspartate level in METTL15 KO cell is consistent with the compromised respiration function. At the same time, the up-regulated level of lactate suggests that cells use more anaerobic glycolysis to compensate for impaired mitochondrial function (Fig. 5D and S5, A–C). These results indicate that METTL15 is important for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular metabolic homeostasis. Here we describe the identification of METTL15 as the methyltransferase that generates m4C839 in human 12S mt-rRNA. METTL15 orthologs exist in most eukaryotes, which implies the importance of this methyltransferase for proper mitoribosome functions. Consistent with this hypothesis, mitochondrial translation is inhibited, and oxidative phosphorylation is remarkably compromised in the METTL15 KO cells, identifying an important function of METTL15 in regulating mitochondria functions, likely by methylating 12S mt-rRNA. Ribosomal maturation involves multiple steps of subunit assembly and incorporation of chemical modifications into the rRNA (3Pearce S.F. Rebelo-Guiomar P. D'Souza A.R. Powell C.A. Van Haute L. Minczuk M. Regulation of mammalian mitochondrial gene expression: recent advances.Trends Biochem.

The assembly of protein components and rRNAs has been well characterized through high-resolution cryo-EM, whereas the process of modification deposition is still largely unclear (29Klinge S. Woolford Jr., J.L. Ribosome assembly coming into focus.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 (30467428): 116-13110.1038/s41580-018-0078-yCrossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For the bacterial 16S rRNA, quantitative analysis of rRNA modifications finds that the modification events seem to occur in a 5′-to-3′ sequential order: from the 5′ body domain, to the 3′ head domain, to the 3′ minor domain (30Popova A.M. Williamson J.R. Quantitative analysis of rRNA modifications using stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136 (24422502): 2058-206910.1021/ja412084bCrossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this current study, we found that m4C839 methylation appears to precede m5C841 and is important for the nearby m5C841 methylation, suggesting cross-talk between modifications of the two nearby residues. Furthermore, the enzymatically inactive METTL15 can partially restore the m5C841 methylation decrease in METTL15-null cells, raising the question of whether the cross-talk is mediated by physical interactions between METTL15 and the m5C methyltransferase, NSUN4. Undoubtedly, the investigation of how modifications of mt-rRNA are coordinately deposited in an orderly manner will significantly increase our understanding of mitoribosome maturation (31Shi Z. Xu S.

https://openalex.org/W3020848255,"Purpose Chemotherapy resistance of esophageal cancer is a key factor affecting the postoperative treatment of esophageal cancer. Among the media that transmit signals between cells, the exosomes secreted by tumor cells mediate information transmission between tumor cells, which can make sensitive cells obtain resistance. Although some cellular exosomes play an important role in tumor’s acquired drug resistance, the related action mechanism is still not explored specifically. Methods To elucidate this process, we constructed a cisplatin-resistant esophageal cancer cell line, and proved that exosomes conferring cellular resistance in esophageal cancer can promote cisplatin resistance in sensitive cells. Through high-throughput sequencing analysis of the exosome and of cells after stimulation by exosomes, we determined that the miRNA193 in exosomes conferring cellular resistance played a key role in sensitive cells acquiring resistance to cisplatin. In vitro experiments showed that miRNA193 can regulate the cell cycle of esophageal cancer cells and inhibit apoptosis, so that sensitive cells can acquire resistance to cisplatin. An in vivo experiment proved that miRNA193 can promote tumor proliferation through the exosomes, and provide sensitive cells with slight resistance to cisplatin. Results Small RNA sequencing of exosomes showed that exosomes in drug-resistant cells have 189 up-regulated and 304 down-regulated miRNAs; transcriptome results showed that drug-sensitive cells treated with drug-resistant cellular exosomes have 3446 high-expression and 1709 low-expression genes; correlation analysis showed that drug-resistant cellular exosomes mainly affect the drug resistance of sensitive cells through paths such as cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, and the VEGF and Jak-STAT signaling pathways; miRNA193, one of the high-expression miRNAs in drug-resistant cellular exosomes, can promote drug resistance by removing cisplatin’s inhibition of the cell cycle of sensitive cells. Conclusion Sensitive cells can become resistant to cisplatin through acquired drug-resistant cellular exosomes, and miRNA193 can make tumor cells acquire cisplatin resistance by regulating the cell cycle."

As a result, understanding the prevalence of MCC is increasingly being recognized as a public health imperative. This research describes the prevalence and distribution of adults with MCC across the United States using 2017 data from the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS). Prevalence of MCC was calculated for each U.S. state and territory overall, by sex and by age. Additionally, the most common condition dyads (two condition combinations) and triads (three condition combinations) were assessed for each state. Prevalence of MCC ranged from 37.9% in the District of Columbia to 64.4% in West Virginia. Females had a higher prevalence than males in 47 of 53 states and territories, and MCC prevalence increased with age in every state and territory. Overall prevalence estimates were higher than estimates using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), especially in the younger population (aged 18-44), due partly to the inclusion of high cholesterol, obesity, and depression as chronic conditions. Analysis of the most prevalent dyads and triads revealed the greatest state-by-state variability in the 18-44-year-old population. Multiple states' most prevalent dyads and triads for this population included obesity and depression. These findings build an accurate picture of the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions across the United States and will aid public health officials in creating programs targeted to their region."
https://openalex.org/W3021319600,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most frequent genetic cardiac disease with a prevalence of 1:500 to 1:200. While most patients show obstructive HCM and a relatively stable clinical phenotype (stage II), a small group of patients progresses to end-stage HCM (stage IV) within a relatively brief period. Previous research has shown sex-differences in stage II HCM with more diastolic dysfunction in female than in male patients. Moreover, female patients more often show progression to heart failure. Here we investigated if differences in functional and structural properties of the heart may underlie sex-differences in disease progression from stage II to stage IV HCM. Cardiac tissue from stage II and IV patients was obtained during myectomy (n = 54) and heart transplantation (n = 10), respectively. Isometric force was measured in membrane-permeabilized cardiomyocytes to define active and passive myofilament force development. Titin isoform composition was assessed using gel electrophoresis, and the amount of fibrosis and capillary density were determined with histology. In accordance with disease stage-dependent adverse cardiac remodeling end-stage patients showed a thinner interventricular septal wall and larger left ventricular and atrial diameters compared to stage II patients. Cardiomyocyte contractile properties and fibrosis were comparable between stage II and IV, while capillary density was significantly lower in stage IV compared to stage II. Women showed more adverse cellular remodeling compared to men at stage II, evident from more compliant titin, more fibrosis and lower capillary density. However, the disease stage-dependent reduction in capillary density was largest in men. In conclusion, the more severe cellular remodeling in female compared to male stage II patients suggests a more advanced disease stage at the time of myectomy in women. Changes in cardiomyocyte contractile properties do not explain the progression of stage II to stage IV, while reduced capillary density may underlie disease progression to end-stage heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W3021087220,"Regulatory pressure along with environmental and human health concerns drive the development of soil fumigation alternatives such as soil biosolarization (SBS). SBS involves tarping soil that is at field capacity with a transparent film following amendment with certain organic materials. Heating via the greenhouse effect results in an increase of the soil temperature. The organic amendments can promote microbial activity that can enhance pest inactivation by depleting oxygen, producing biopesticidal fermentation products, and competing with pests. The properties of the organic amendments can heavily influence the type and magnitude of these effects. This study evaluated the viability of chitin as a novel SBS soil amendment to influence soil fungal and bacterial microbial communities, including control of the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lactucae (FOL). Changes to FOL and the broader soil microbiota were monitored in response to biosolarization using 0.1% (by dry weight) amendment with chitin (Rootguard). FOL suppression was only observed in chitin amended soils that were incubated at room temperature, not under solarized conditions. Conversely, it decreased solarization efficacy in the upper (0–10 cm) soil layer. The presence of chitin also showed increase in FOL under anaerobic and fluctuating temperature regime conditions. Biosolarization with chitin amendment did exhibit an impact on the overall soil microbial community. The fungal genus Mortierella and the bacterial family Chitinophagaceae were consistently enriched in biosolarized soils with chitin amendment. This study showed low potential FOL suppression due chitin amendment at the studied levels. However, chitin amendment showed a higher impact on the fungal community than the bacterial community. The impact of these microbial changes on crop protection and yields need to be studied in the long-term."

Out of a multitude of variables gathered at CR admission and discharge, we aimed to identify predictors of returning to work (RTW) and HRQL 6 months after CR. Design Prospective observational multi-centre study, enrolment in CR between 05/2017 and 05/2018. Method Besides general data (e.g. age, sex, diagnoses), parameters of risk factor management (e.g. smoking, hypertension), physical performance (e.g. maximum exercise capacity, endurance training load, 6-min walking distance) and patient-reported outcome measures (e.g. depression, anxiety, HRQL, subjective well-being, somatic and mental health, pain, lifestyle change motivation, general self-efficacy, pension desire and self-assessment of the occupational prognosis using several questionnaires) were documented at CR admission and discharge. These variables (at both measurement times and as changes during CR) were analysed using multiple linear regression models regarding their predictive value for RTW status and HRQL (SF-12) six months after CR. Results Out of 1262 patients (54±7 years, 77% men), 864 patients (69%) returned to work. Predictors of failed RTW were primarily the desire to receive pension (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.22–0.50) and negative self-assessed occupational prognosis (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.24–0.48) at CR discharge, acute coronary syndrome (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.47–0.88) and comorbid heart failure (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.30–0.87). High educational level, stress at work and physical and mental HRQL were associated with successful RTW. HRQL was determined predominantly by patient-reported outcome measures (e.g. pension desire, self-assessed health prognosis, anxiety, physical/mental HRQL/health, stress, well-being and self-efficacy) rather than by clinical parameters or physical performance. Conclusion Patient-reported outcome measures predominantly influenced return to work and HRQL in patients with heart disease. Therefore, the multi-component CR approach focussing on psychosocial support is crucial for subjective health prognosis and occupational resumption.

Specifically, we derive numerical values, and associated variability scores for statements of general probability as well as for anchor terms commonly expressed on Likert-type scales. Our results show significant inter-responder variability in the understanding of such terms. We also demonstrate scale compression such that average estimates are poorly aligned to the a priori expectations of equal response spacing in commonly used verbal response instruments. Terms further show intriguing propensities such that people agree more about statements of agreement, but manifestly disagree more about statements of disagreement. The valence of these terms is thus systematically related to their degree of common understanding. The accuracy of language, especially when used in conjunction with modern advanced technologies, proves vital for effective communication.

https://openalex.org/W3022324258,"Sirtuins (e.g. human Sirt1-7) catalyze the removal of acyl groups from lysine residues in proteins in an NAD+-dependent manner, and loss of sirtuin deacylase activity correlates with the development of aging-related diseases. Although multiple reports suggest that sirtuin activity is regulated by oxidative post-translational modifications of cysteines during inflammation and aging, no systematic comparative study of potential direct sirtuin cysteine oxidative modifications has been performed. Here, using IC50 and kinact/KI analyses, we quantified the ability of nitrosothiols (S-nitrosoglutathione and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine), nitric oxide, oxidized GSH, and hydrogen peroxide to post-translationally modify and inhibit the deacylase activity of Sirt1, Sirt2, Sirt3, Sirt5, and Sirt6. The inhibition was correlated with cysteine modification and assessed with chemical-probe and blot-based assays for cysteine S-nitrosation, sulfenylation, and glutathionylation. We show that the primarily nuclear sirtuins Sirt1 and Sirt6, as well as the primarily cytosolic sirtuin Sirt2, are modified and inhibited by cysteine S-nitrosation in response to exposure to both free nitric oxide and nitrosothiols (kinact/KI ≥ 5 m-1 s-1), which is the first report of Sirt2 and Sirt6 inhibition by S-nitrosation. Surprisingly, the mitochondrial sirtuins Sirt3 and Sirt5 were resistant to inhibition by cysteine oxidants. Collectively, these results suggest that nitric oxide-derived oxidants may causatively link nuclear and cytosolic sirtuin inhibition to aging-related inflammatory disease development."

In the present study, we investigated the germination and seedling growth of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) under La (10 μM), ABA (10 μM) and La + ABA treatments. The results showed that La, ABA and La + ABA treatments could not significantly affect the germination and shoot length as compared to the control (P>0.05). However, La treatment increased the root activity and chlorophyll content, and ABA treatment enhanced root length and root activity (P<0.05). La + ABA treatments demonstrated that La could not significantly alleviate the promotion of ABA in root length, while ABA reversed the increase of chlorophyll content caused by La. The coregulation of La and ABA on chlorophyll content was further explored by in vitro experiments and quantum chemical calculations. In vitro experiments revealed that La, ABA, and La + ABA treatments reduced the absorbance of chlorophyll, and quantum chemical calculations indicated that the reduction of absorbance was caused by the reactions between La, ABA and chlorophyll. In vivo and in vitro experiments, together with quantum chemical calculations, demonstrated that both ABA and La could stimulate the production of chlorophyll, while they also could react with chlorophyll to produce La-monochlorophyll, La-bischlorophyll, and ABA adsorbed chlorophyll, which had lower absorbance. La + ABA treatment significantly decreased the chlorophyll content in vivo. This phenomenon was due to the fact that La and ABA formed LaABA compound, which markedly reduced the concentrations of ABA and La, and the effect of promoting chlorophyll production was overcome by the effect of reducing chlorophyll absorbance."

Several long-term investigations have evaluated the influence of multi-mix (multiple species) cover crop treatments on soil health and microbial diversity. The present study investigated the short-term effects of a seven species multi-mix cover crop treatment on soil nutrient content and microbial diversity, compared to a single-mix cover crop treatment and control. Analysis of 16S sequencing data of isolated soil DNA revealed that the single-mix cover crop treatment decreased overall microbial abundance and diversity, whereas the control and multi-mix treatments altered the overall microbial composition in similar fluctuating trends. Furthermore, we observed significant changes in specific bacteria belonging to the phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria and Verrucombicrobia for all treatments, but only the single-mix significantly decreased in abundance of the selected bacteria over time. Our findings indicate that the control and multi-mix treatments are better at maintaining overall microbial composition and diversity compared to the single-mix. Further study is required to elucidate the specific difference between the treatment effect of the multi-mix treatment and the control, given that their microbial composition changes over time were similar but they diverge into two populations of unique bacterial types by the end of this short-term study."

Some cellular responses, such as growth and cell cycle progression, may be viewed as short-term, whereas responses such as terminal differentiation and programmed cell death (apoptosis) may be viewed as decisive and cell fate-determining, with limited or no plasticity. Core modules in signal transduction networks include the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, notably the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 pathways in mammals (1Chang L.

Consistent with these opposing roles that influence normal tissue development, homeostasis, and immune responses, aberrations in MAPK signal transduction are found in the vast majority of human cancers and are broadly implicated in tumorigenesis (8Dhillon A.S. Hagan S. Rath O. Kolch W. MAP kinase signalling pathways in cancer.Oncogene. 2007; 26 (17496922): 3279-329010.1038/sj.onc.1210421Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 9Wagner E.F.

Parsing the roles of specific nodes in a signal transduction network, many of which are protein kinases, is plagued by multiple challenges that are often unacknowledged, because traditional methods frequently fail to address them. For one, cytokines and environmental stressors generally activate multiple pathways simultaneously, making it difficult to isolate the effect of a particular signaling protein. Adding to the difficulty of this issue are the natural interactions between canonical pathways (i.e. cross-talk). For example, the MAPK cascades affect one another by influencing the expression of dual-specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate and thus deactivate the various MAPKs with differing specificities (10Caunt C.J. Keyse S.M. Dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs): Shaping the outcome of MAP kinase signalling.FEBS J. 2013; 280 (22812510): 489-50410.1111/j.1742-4658.2012.08716.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 11Finch A.R.

This interaction was first suggested by the evidence that ERK1/2 co-immunoprecipitates with p38 (12Zhang H. Shi X. Hampong M. Blanis L. Pelech S. Stress-induced inhibition of ERK1 and ERK2 by direct interaction with p38 MAP kinase.J. Biol.

In another study, arsenite treatment induced p38 activation and prevented phorbol ester–triggered activation of MEK and ERK, and this inhibitory effect was attributed to enhanced activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (13Westermarck J. Li S.-P. Kallunki T. Han J. Kähäri V.-M. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent activation of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 activity and collagenase 1 (MMP-1) gene expression.Mol.

Activation of p38 induces dephosphorylation of MEK and apoptosis in various cell types (14Grethe S.

In such studies, pharmacological inhibitors are commonly used to help deduce a protein's function(s), but such an approach only probes loss of function and often lacks complete kinase specificity (16Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. Mclauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S.C. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. The selectivity of protein kinase inhibitors: a further update.Biochem. J. 2007; 408 (17850214): 297-31510.1042/BJ20070797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). To target gain-of-function, cells are typically transfected with a constitutively active variant of the signaling protein, but this approach allows ample time for the cell to alter its gene expression profile. This issue is especially problematic for a pathway that mediates stress responses, as its activation can introduce selective pressure to adapt; obviously, this issue is further magnified for pathways that directly and rapidly promote cell death, such as the p38 signaling cascade (17Díaz-Martínez L.A. Karamysheva Z.N. Warrington R. Li B. Wei S. Xie X. Roth M.G. Yu H. Genome‐wide siRNA screen reveals coupling between mitotic apoptosis and adaptation.EMBO J. 2014; 33 (25024437): 1960-197610.15252/embj.201487826Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Weaver B.A.A.

Various strategies have been implemented to address the limitations outlined above, most commonly by inducing the association or dissociation of a protein-protein interaction via the addition of a small-molecule dimerizer or through light exposure (19Kennedy M.J.

Typically, this strategy involves the translocation of a signaling protein to the plasma membrane to enhance its activity or the release of a protein from a sequestering interaction (23Pathak G.P.

Although induction or release of membrane association is often sufficient to promote signal transduction, it is not a definite “on” switch for catalytic activity. In this study, we develop and apply a photodecaging strategy to rapidly introduce active MKK6, a MAPKK specific to the p38 pathway (27Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J.

With the ability to rapidly generate active MKK6 in cells, we have studied the dynamics of the p38 pathway in relation to p38-mediated apoptosis and the cross-regulation of the ERK pathway. In normal fibroblasts, we found that MKK6 activation is sufficient, and that p38 activation is necessary, for triggering the various phases of apoptosis (caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and cell death) within hours of light-triggered decaging. Consistent with reports on apoptotic responses to inflammatory cytokines and environmental stressors (37Goldstein J.C. Muñoz-Pinedo C. Ricci J.E. Adams S.R. Kelekar A. Schuler M. Tsien R.Y. Green D.R. Cytochrome c is released in a single step during apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12 (15933725): 453-46210.1038/sj.cdd.4401596Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 38Muñoz-Pinedo C.

MKK6 activation also rapidly induces potent inhibition of the ERK pathway; surprisingly, we discovered that this negative cross-talk is essentially p38-independent. This finding was replicated in a murine melanoma line with mutant B-Raf, and optical triggering of MKK6 in these oncogene-addicted cells abrogated ERK-dependent cell division. These results position MKK6 as a pleiotropic signal transducer that both promotes cell death and inhibits pro-proliferative signaling, and they demonstrate the utility of caged kinases as unique tools for dissecting signaling networks—stress-activated pathways in particular. To parse the functions of a stress-activated signaling pathway in cells, we developed a genetically encoded, optically controlled MKK6. The incorporation of the caged lysine (CK) (Fig. 1A) through site-directed, unnatural amino acid mutagenesis has enabled the development of light-activatable proteins. This approach utilizes an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair to selectively incorporate an unnatural amino acid (UAA) into proteins, in response to a recoded UAG amber codon, introduced at a desired site into a gene of interest. Supplementing the protein biosynthetic machinery of cells and animals with an engineered Methanosarcina barkeri pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (pylRS) and its cognate tRNACUA (pylT) enables the incorporation of a wide range of UAAs, including photocaged amino acids (36Courtney T. Deiters A. Recent advances in the optical control of protein function through genetic code expansion.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2018; 46 (30056281): 99-10710.1016/j.cbpa.2018.07.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Photocaged amino acids, such as the CK (31Gautier A. Nguyen D.P. Lusic H. An W. Deiters A. Chin J.W. Genetically encoded photocontrol of protein localization in mammalian cells.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 (20218600): 4086-408810.1021/ja910688sCrossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), contain a light-removable protecting group that imposes steric demand on an enzyme active site and alters the electronic and nucleophilic characteristics of amino acid side chains. This renders the protein of interest inactive until a brief light exposure (e.g. 365-nm irradiation) removes the caging group and generates the protein's WT catalytic site. This is a generalizable approach for the study of protein kinases (32Gautier A. Deiters A. Chin J.W. Light-activated kinases enable temporal dissection of signaling networks in living cells.J. Am.

Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. The P-loop—a common motif in ATP- and GTP-binding proteins.Trends Biochem.

Site-specific incorporation of CK at the conserved Lys82 of constitutively active MKK6 (43Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Dérijard B. Davis R.J.

Expression of caged MKK6 in mammalian cells was achieved by introducing pylRS, eight expression cassettes encoding pylT, and constitutively active MKK6-K82TAG (referred to hereafter as caged MKK6) from two plasmids (Fig. 1C). In HEK293T cells co-transfected with the plasmids and supplemented with or without 2 mm CK, caged protein expression was detected only in the presence of the UAA (Fig. 1D). MKK6 is a dual-specificity kinase that activates p38 by phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) (27Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Selective activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase isoforms by the MAP kinase kinases MKK3 and MKK6.J. Biol.

To confirm the optically controlled signaling function of caged MKK6, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were co-transfected with plasmids expressing caged MKK6 and a plasmid encoding a p38 kinase activity reporter construct, which is exported from the nucleus upon phosphorylation (45Regot S. Hughey J.J. Bajar B.T. Carrasco S. Covert M.W.

After washing the cells and replacing the medium with imaging buffer, reporter localization was monitored by live-cell epifluorescence microscopy. In cells expressing caged MKK6 and incubated with CK, a brief (<2-s) exposure to UV light (DAPI excitation filter) rapidly induced p38 kinase activity, as shown by the live-cell reporter (45Regot S. Hughey J.J. Bajar B.T. Carrasco S. Covert M.W.

No such UV-induced translocation responses were observed in the negative controls: cells incubated without CK (Fig. 2C) or in cells incubated with CK but expressing mCherry in place of constitutively active MKK6 (Fig. S1, A–C). These controls indicate that p38 is not activated by a brief UV exposure alone or by decaging of lysines that might have been incorporated in an inert protein or the endogenous proteome. The translocation response in caged MKK6-expressing cells was promptly and completely reversed following the addition of the p38α/β-specific inhibitor SB 239063 (46Underwood D.C. Osborn R.R.

Ther. 2000; 293 (10734180): 281-288PubMed Google Scholar) (10 μm; Fig. 2D). The extent and kinetics of the p38 reporter response elicited by MKK6 decaging were comparable with those elicited by the chemical stressor, anisomycin (Fig. 2E). We also confirmed that brief UV exposure does not induce significant translocation of the analogous JNK activity reporter, either with or without expression of caged MKK6 (Fig. 2F and Fig. S1D). For Fig. 2 (C–F), variability among the time courses of the individual cells is shown in Fig. S2. Taken together, these results establish an experimental system in which canonical MKK6 → p38 signaling is readily and specifically induced by a brief and benign exposure to low-energy UV light. Stress-activated signaling pathways orchestrate pronounced cellular responses, such as autophagy and apoptosis, which are difficult to study in traditional genetics experiments. JNK and p38 signaling have been strongly implicated in apoptosis of normal and cancer cells through a variety of mechanisms (5Mansouri A. Ridgway L.D. Korapati A.L. Zhang Q. Tian L. Wang Y.

To realize the absorber layer via an inexpensive route, printed thin-films could be fabricated from dispersions of nano-sized Cu3VSe4 precursors. Herein, cubic Cu3VSe4 nanocrystals were successfully synthesized via a hot-injection method. Similar with reported Cu3VS4 nanocrystals, Cu3VSe4 nanocrystals with cubic structure exhibit three absorption bands in the UV-Visible range indicative of a potential intermediate bandgap existence. A thin film fabricated by depositing the nanoparticles Cu3VSe4 on FTO coated glass substrate, exhibited a p-type behavior and a photocurrent of ~ 4 μA/cm2 when measured in an electrochemical cell setting. This first demonstration of photocurrent exhibited by a CVSe nanocrystals thin film signifies a promising potential in photovoltaic applications."
https://openalex.org/W3021993572,"Importance Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a leading cause of blindness with several intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents available for its management such as aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab. However, direct comparisons between these three agents among the same patient population are limited. Objective To assess the rate and growth of complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) in eyes with nAMD treated with aflibercept, bevacizumab, and/or ranibizumab. Method Retrospective cohort study of patients with treatment-naïve neovascular AMD seen at an academic hospital between October 2006 and February 2019. Study eyes were treated with intravitreal injections of aflibercept, bevacizumab, and/or ranibizumab and followed for two years. Main outcomes and measures cRORA prevalence, location, size, and growth rate. Eyes were imaged with Cirrus spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Presence and size of cRORA were calculated using the FDA-approved Advanced RPE Analysis software. Linear regression models were used to correlate cRORA progression with baseline demographic and ocular characteristics, anti-VEGF drug, and number of injections. Unpaired t-tests, ANOVA, and linear regression models were computed with SAS 9.4. Results 197 eyes from 158 patients (mean age 78.9, 62.9% women) received an average of 13 anti-VEGF injections over 24 months. 22% developed new cRORA. Mean cRORA area increased from 1.71 mm2 to 2.93 mm2. At 24 months, eyes with 11+ injections had significantly less cRORA area (11+ injections, 4.02 mm2; ≤ 10 injections, 2.46 mm2; p = 0.01) and growth rate (11+ injections, 0.41 mm2/year; ≤ 10 injections, 1.05 mm2/year; p = 0.02). Choice of anti-VEGF drug yielded no significant difference in cRORA progression. Conclusions and relevance Treating nAMD with aflibercept, bevacizumab or ranibizumab demonstrated comparable cRORA development at 24 months. Number of injections inversely correlated with cRORA area and growth. These results warrant further investigation in the pathophysiology of cRORA in anti-VEGF treated eyes."
https://openalex.org/W3022328861,"Introduction While type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been associated with increased all-cause mortality among women diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), the association between T2D and breast cancer-specific (BCS) mortality is unresolved. The goal of this study was to examine the association between T2D and BCS mortality and examine the influence of metformin treatment on mortality rates. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2002 and 2008 at Emory University Hospitals among non-Hispanic black and white women who had confirmed diagnosis of stage I-III BC and known diabetes status (T2D: n = 73; non-T2D: n = 514). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Compared to non-T2D patients, T2D women had almost a 2-fold increase in BCS mortality after adjusting for covariates (HR = 2.01; 95%CI = 1.02–3.98). Though attenuated, the increased hazard of death was also observed for all-cause mortality (HR = 1.74; 95%CI = 1.06–2.87). T2D patients who were not on metformin had substantially higher hazard of BCS mortality compared to non-diabetic patients (HR = 4.54; 95%CI = 1.98–10.44), whereas the association among T2D patients treated with metformin was weak (HR = 1.20; 95%CI = 0.36–3.97) and included the null. Conclusions Among women with BC, T2D is associated with increased BCS mortality. Metformin treatment for T2D during the initial diagnosis of BC may improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3020958097,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs initially thought to be restricted exclusively to germline cells. In recent years, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that piRNAs are actually expressed in pluripotent, neural, cardiac and even cancer cells. However, controversy remains around the existence and function of somatic piRNAs. Using small RNA-seq samples from H9 pluripotent cells differentiated to mesoderm progenitors and cardiomyocytes we identified the expression of 447 piRNA transcripts, of which 241 were detected in pluripotency, 218 in mesoderm and 171 in cardiac cells. The majority of them originated from the sense strand of protein coding and lncRNAs genes in all stages of differentiation, though no evidences of amplification loop (ping-pong) were found. Genes hosting piRNA transcripts in cardiac samples were related to critical biological processes in the heart, like contraction and cardiac muscle development. Our results indicate that these piRNAs might have a role in fine-tuning the expression of genes involved in differentiation of pluripotent cells to cardiomyocytes."

With the exception of five rare alleles discovered for the first time in our study, most of these alleles were known alleles of Wx. Furthermore, a set of Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers based on these Wx alleles have been developed, and thirty-six main parents of hybrid rice from 1976 to 2018 were selected for Wx genotyping. The results showed that only three Wx alleles existed in the main parents of hybrids, and the allelic combination of the hybrids changed from Wxa/Wxb and Wxlv/Wxb to Wxb/Wxb with the development of hybrid rice. Wxb is widely used in the male parents of hybrid rice. Wxa and Wxlv were used in the female parents of early hybrid rice, and they were gradually replaced by Wxb. In the future, more favourable Wx alleles from cultivated rice should be identified, introduced, and effectively used to improve hybrid rice quality."
https://openalex.org/W3021703089,"Objective To identify risk factors for potential Drug-Related Problems (DRP) at admission in hospitalized patients. Methodology Prospective cohort study conducted in adults patients hospitalized (May 2016 to May 2018) in a general tertiary care hospital in Brazil. Potential DRP were detected by daily review of 100% of electronic medication orders by hospital pharmacists and classified by the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe classification system (PCNE version 6.2). For the identification of risk factors of potential DRP, backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify the set of independent predictors among over 120 variables collected in the initial 48 hours after admission in a training set consisting of 2/3 of the study population. The model was validated in the remaining sample. Results The study population consisted of 1686 patients aged 52.0+/- 18.3 years-old, 51.4% females, with a median length of stay of 3.24 days, and 4.5% in-hospital mortality. The cumulative incidence of potential DRP was 14.5%. Admission for elective surgery and main diagnosis of disease of the circulatory system were associated with reduced risk of DRP (OR 0.41 and 0.57, respectively, p<0.05). The independent risk factors of DRP are heart rate ≥ 80 bpm (OR 1.41, p = 0.05), prescription of more than seven drugs in day 2 (OR 1.63, p = 0.05), prescription in day 1 of drugs of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Code (ATC) class A (alimentary tract and metabolism, OR 2.24, p = 0.003), prescription in day 2 of two or more ATC class A drugs (OR = 3.52, p<0.001), and in day 1 of ATC class J drugs (antiinfectives for systemic use, OR 1.97, p = 0.001). In the validation set, the c-statistic of the predictive model was 0.65, the sensitivity was 56.1% and the specificity was 65.2%. Conclusion This study identified seven independent risk factors of potential DRP in patients hospitalized in a general hospital that have fair predictive performance for utilization in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3022528039,"This study was implemented to assess the Sessile Bioindicators in Permanent Quadrats (SBPQ) underwater environmental alert method. The SBPQ is a non-invasive and low-cost protocol; it uses sessile target species (indicators) to detect environmental alterations (natural or anthropic) at either the local or global (i.e., climate change) scale and the intrusion of invasive species. The SBPQ focuses on the monitoring of preselected sessile and sensitive benthic species associated with rocky coralligenous habitats using permanent quadrats in underwater sentinel stations. The selected target species have been well documented as bioindicators that disappear in the absence of environmental stability. However, whether these species are good indicators of stability or, in contrast, suffer variations in long-term coverage has not been verified. The purpose of this study was to assess the part of the method based on the hypothesis that, over a long temporal series in a highly structured and biodiverse coralligenous assemblage, the cover of sensitive sessile species does not change over time if the environmental stability characterising the habitat is not altered. Over a ten-year period (2005-2014), the sublittoral sessile biota in the Straits of Gibraltar Natural Park on the southern Iberian Peninsula was monitored at a 28 m-deep underwater sentinel stations. Analyses of the coverages of target indicator species (i.e., Paramuricea clavata and Astroides calycularis) together with other accompanying sessile organisms based on the periodic superimposition of gridded images from horizontal and vertical rocky surfaces allowed us to assess the effectiveness of the method. We conclude that no alterations occurred during the study period; only minimal fluctuations in cover were detected, and the method is reliable for detecting biological changes in ecosystems found in other geographical areas containing the chosen indicator species at similar dominance levels."
https://openalex.org/W3023035931,"Background Re-treatment in patients with a chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and a previous failure to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment remains a challenge. Therefore, we investigated the success rate of treatment and re-treatment regimens used at our center from October 2011 to March 2018. Methods A retrospective analysis of DAA-based HCV therapies of 1096 patients was conducted. Factors associated with a virological relapse were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression, treatment success of the re-treatment regimens was evaluated by an analysis of sustained virological response (SVR) rates in patients with a documented follow-up 12 weeks after the end of treatment. Results Of 1096 patients treated with DAA-based regimens, 91 patients (8%) were lost to follow-up, 892 of the remaining 1005 patients (89%) achieved an SVR12. Most patients (65/113, 58%) who experienced a virological relapse received an interferon-based DAA regimen. SVR rates were comparable in special cohorts like liver transplant recipients (53/61, 87%) and people with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection (41/45, 91%). On multivariable analysis, interferon-based DAA therapy was associated with treatment failure (odds ratio 0.111, 95%-confidence interval 0.054–0.218) among others. One hundred seventeen patients with multiple DAA treatment courses were identified, of which 97 patients (83%) experienced a single relapse, but further relapses after two (18/117, 15%) or even three (2/117, 2%) treatment courses were also observed. Eighty-two of 96 (85%) re-treatment attempts with all-oral DAA regimens were successful after an initial treatment failure. Conclusion Overall, DAA re-treatments were highly effective in this real-world cohort and only a minority of patients failed more than two treatment courses. Switching to–or addition of–a new drug class seem to be valid options for the re-treatment of patients especially after failure of an interferon-based regimen."
https://openalex.org/W3023963813,"Introduction Quality indicators and pay-for-performance schemes aim to improve processes and outcomes in clinical practice. However, general practitioner and patient characteristics influence quality indicator performance. In Switzerland, no data on the pay-for-performance approach exists and the use of quality indicators has been marginal. The aim of this study was to describe quality indicator performance in diabetes care in Swiss primary care and to analyze associations of practice, general practitioner and patient covariates with quality indicator performance. Methods For this cross-sectional study, we used medical routine data from an electronic medical record database. Data from 71 general practitioners and all their patients with diabetes were included. Starting in July 2018, we retrieved 12-month retrospective data about practice, general practitioner and patient characteristics, laboratory values, comorbidities and co-medication. Based on this data, we assessed quality indicator performance of process and intermediate outcomes for glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, cholesterol and associations of practice, general practitioner and patient characteristics with individual and cumulative quality indicator performance. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using regression methods. Results We assessed 3,383 patients with diabetes (57% male, mean age 68.3 years). On average, patients fulfilled 3.56 (standard deviation: 1.89) quality indicators, whereas 17.2% of the patients fulfilled all six quality indicators. On practice and general practitioner level, we found no associations with cumulative quality indicator performance. On patient level, gender (ref = male) (OR: 0.83, CI: 0.78–0.88), number of treating general practitioners (OR: 0.94, CI: 0.91–0.97), number of comorbidities (OR: 1.43, CI: 1.38–1.47) and number of consultations (OR: 1.02, CI: 1.02–1.02) were associated with cumulative quality indicator performance. Conclusion The influence of practice, general practitioner and patient characteristics on quality indicator performance was surprisingly small and room for improvement in quality indicator performance of Swiss general practitioners seems to exist in diabetes care."
https://openalex.org/W3021545286,"Objective There are controversial opinions on anticoagulation for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) in patients with liver failure (LF) and increased bleeding risk. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) versus no-anticoagulation for CVVH in these patients. Methods The included patients were divided into RCA and no-anticoagulation group according to the CVVH anticoagulation strategy they accepted for CVVH. Filter lifespan, bleeding, citrate accumulation, catheter occlusion, and totCa/ionCa ratio were evaluated as outcomes. Results In the original cohort, the filter lifespan of the RCA group (41 patients, 79 filters) was significantly longer than the no-anticoagulation group (62 patients, 162 filters) (> 72 hours vs 39.5 hours (IQR 31.2–47.8), P = 0.002). The adjusted results demonstrated that RCA could significantly reduce the risk of filter failure (HR = 0.459, 95%CI 0.26–0.82, P = 0.008). Four episodes of totCa/ionCa > 2.5 were observed in the RCA group and continuously accepted RCA-CVVH after the reduction of citrate dose and blood flow. No obvious citrate accumulation was observed in these patients. In the matched cohort, the filter lifespan of the RCA group was significantly longer than the no-anticoagulation group (P = 0.013) as well. No significant difference in the episodes of totCa/ionCa > 2.5 was observed between the two matched groups (P = 0.074). Both in the original cohort and the matched cohort, the bleeding, acidosis, alkalosis, and catheter occlusion incidences were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions In LF patients with increased bleeding risk who underwent CVVH, RCA could prolong the filter lifespan and be safely used with careful blood gas monitoring and citrate dose adjusting. Further prospective, randomized, control studies are warranted to obtain robust evidences."

The Mumbai Districts AIDS Control Society along with Médecins Sans Frontières has provided routine VL measurements and EAC to PLHA on ART at King Edward Memorial (KEM) hospital, Mumbai since October-2016. This study aims to describe the initial VL results and impact of EAC on viral suppression and factors associated with initial viral non-suppression among patients with an initial detectable VL, in a cohort of patients tested between October-2016 and September-2018.This is a descriptive study of PLHA on ART who received VL testing and EAC during October-2016 to September-2018. Log-binomial regression was used to identify factors associated with a high VL.Among 3849 PLHA who underwent VL testing, 1603(42%) were female and median age was 42 years (IQR:35-48). Majority were referred for routine testing (3432(89%)) and clinical/immunological failure (233(6%)). Overall, 3402(88%) PLHA had suppressed VL at initial testing. Among 3432 tested for routine monitoring, 3141(92%) had VL suppressed. Of 291 with VL>1000c/ml, 253(87%) received EAC and after repeat VL, 70(28%) had VL<1000c/ml. Among 233 referred for clinical/immunological failure, 122(52%) had VL>1000c/ml and 109 have been switched to second-line ART. CD4 count<500 (aOR-5.0[95%CI 3.8-6.5]), on ART for<5 years (aOR-1.5[1.1-2.0]) and age<15 years (aOR-5.2[3.0-8.9]) were associated with an initial VL>1000c/ml. Factors associated with follow-up VL suppression included EAC (p<0.05) and being on second-line ART (p<0.05).Results from a routine VL program in public sector in India were encouraging and in line with UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. Routine VL monitoring along with EAC resulted in early switch to alternative optimised regimens while also preventing unnecessary switches. Along with the vital scale up of routine VL monitoring, implementation of enhanced adherence strategies for patients with detectable viral load should be ensured."

Beauveria bassiana 08F04 isolated from the surface of cysts is a promising biological control agent for cereal cyst nematodes. As the colonization capacity is a crucial criteria to assess biocontrol effectiveness for a microbial agent candidate, we aimed to label B. bassiana 08F04 for efficient monitoring of colonization in the soil. The binary pCAM-gfp plasmid containing sgfp and hph was integrated into B. bassiana 08F04 using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The transformation caused a significant change in mycelial and conidial yields, and in extracellular chitinase activity in some transformants. The cultural filtrates of some transformants also decreased acetylcholinesterase activity and the survival of Heterodera filipjevi second-stage juveniles relative to the wild-type strain. One transformant (G10) had a growth rate and biocontrol efficacy similar to the wild-type strain, so it was used for a pilot study of B. bassiana colonization conducted over 13 weeks. Real-time PCR results and CFU counts revealed that the population of G10 increased quickly over the first 3 weeks, then decreased slowly over the following 4 weeks before stabilizing. In addition, the application of wild-type B. bassiana 08F04 and transformant G10 significantly reduced the number of H. filipjevi females in roots by 64.4% and 60.2%, respectively. The results of this study have practical applications for ecological, biological and functional studies of B. bassiana 08F04 and for bionematicide registration."
https://openalex.org/W3021453154,"Rationale Severe early-life respiratory illnesses, particularly those caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV), are strongly associated with the development of asthma in children. Puerto Rican children in particular have a strikingly high asthma burden. However, prior studies of the potential associations between early-life respiratory illnesses and asthma in Puerto Rican and other minority populations have been limited. Objectives We sought to determine whether early-life respiratory illness was associated with asthma in Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and African American children. Methods Using a logistic regression analysis, we examined the association between early-life respiratory illnesses (report of upper respiratory infection (URI), pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis/RSV) within the first two years of life and physician-diagnosed asthma after the age of two in a large cohort of Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and African American children. Measurements and main results While early-life respiratory illnesses were associated with greater asthma odds in Puerto Ricans, Mexican Americans, and African Americans, these associations were stronger among Puerto Rican children. Specifically, in Puerto Ricans, the odds was 6.15 (95% CI: 4.21–9.05) if the child reported at least one of the following respiratory illness: URI, pneumonia, bronchitis or bronchiolitis. The odds were also higher in Puerto Ricans when considering these conditions separately. Conclusions We observed population-specific associations between early-life respiratory illnesses and asthma, which were especially significant and stronger in Puerto Ricans. Taken together with the known high burden of RSV in Puerto Rico, our results may help explain the high burden of asthma in Puerto Ricans."
https://openalex.org/W3022229814,"A risk assessment was conducted to assess the risk of ASFV entry into Japan through pork products illegally brought in by air passengers from China and fed to pigs in Japan. Scenario tree modelling was used with the following entry and exposure pathway considered to be the most likely route of ASF entry: an ASFV infected pork product is illegally brought into Japan by air travellers from China; this pork product is then used in a restaurant where scrap waste is recycled for animal feed and subsequently fed to pigs without being heat-treated. Input parameter values were based on surveys conducted by the authors, scientific data gathered from the literature and official data published by government agencies. The annual probability of ASFV entry into Japan via this pathway was predicted to be 0.20 (90% prediction interval: 0.00-0.90). The wide prediction interval was mainly caused by the uncertainty regarding the dose response relation of ASFV, followed by the probability of an ASF infected pig dying on affected farms, the loading of ASFV in an infected pig and the probability of an illegally imported pork product being heat-treated in China and used in restaurants. The results of scenario analysis revealed that the annual probability of ASFV entry into Japan will increase with an increase in the number of ASF affected farms in China. The probability of ASFV entry will increase substantially even if only a small proportion of Ecofeed is not heat-treated during the production process. The probability will decrease if an increased proportion of farms that feed swill apply heat-treatment before feeding swill to their pigs. These findings indicate that stringent application of heat-treatment of Ecofeed and swill is key to protecting the Japanese pig industry from the introduction of ASFV."
https://openalex.org/W3022731639,"Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a biodegradable polymer that is synthesized by a wide range of microorganisms. One of the derivatives of PHA, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBH) has flexible material properties and low melting temperature. We have previously demonstrated that PHBH is degradable in a freshwater environment via the formation of biofilm on the surface of the PHBH film. Undibacterium sp. KW1 and YM2, which were isolated from the biofilm present on the PHBH film in the freshwater sample, were shown to have PHBH-degrading activity. In this study, the complete genome sequence of KW1 and YM2 revealed that the extracellular PHA depolymerase gene, designated as phaZUD, was present in their chromosomes. Sequence analysis revealed that PhaZUD contained four domains: a signal peptide, catalytic domain, linker domain, and substrate-binding domain. Escherichia coli harboring a PhaZUD-expressing plasmid showed PHBH-degrading activity in LB medium containing 1 wt% PHBH powder. The recombinant His-tagged PhaZUD from KW1 and YM2 was purified from the culture supernatant and shown to have PHBH-degrading activity at the optimum temperature of 35 and 40°C, respectively. When the degradation product in the PHBH solution was treated with PhaZUD and assayed by LC-TOF-MS, we detected various oligomer structures, but no more than pentamers, which consist of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyhexanoate. These results demonstrated that PhaZUD may have an endo-type extracellular PHA depolymerase activity."
https://openalex.org/W3021185653,"Pleckstrin homology domain-containing A7 (PLEKHA7) is a cytoplasmic protein at adherens junctions that has been implicated in hypertension, glaucoma, and responses to Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin. Complex formation between PLEKHA7, PDZ domain-containing 11 (PDZD11), tetraspanin 33, and the α-toxin receptor ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10) promotes junctional clustering of ADAM10 and α-toxin-mediated pore formation. However, how the N-terminal region of PDZD11 interacts with the N-terminal tandem WW domains of PLEKHA7 and how this interaction promotes tetraspanin 33 binding to the WW1 domain is unclear. Here, we used site-directed mutagenesis, glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments, immunofluorescence, molecular modeling, and docking experiments to characterize the mechanisms driving these interactions. We found that Asp-30 of WW1 and His-75 of WW2 interact through a hydrogen bond and, together with Thr-35 of WW1, form a binding pocket that accommodates a polyproline stretch within the N-terminal PDZD11 region. By strengthening the interactions of the ternary complex, the WW2 domain stabilized the WW1 domain and cooperatively promoted the interaction with PDZD11. Modeling results indicated that, in turn, PDZD11 binding induces a conformational rearrangement, which strengthens the ternary complex, and contributes to enlarging a hot region on the WW1 domain. The last two lipophilic residues of tetraspanin 33, Trp-283 and Tyr-282, were required for its interaction with PLEKHA7. Docking of the tetraspanin 33 C terminus revealed that it fits into the hydrophobic hot spot region of the accessible surface of WW1. We conclude that communication between the two tandem WW domains of PLEKHA7 and the PLEKHA7-PDZD11 interaction modulate the ligand-binding properties of PLEKHA7."

Once there is a temperature difference between the upper surface exposed to sunlight and the lower surface in the water, the device is capable of generating power while floating in the wetland environment. Fresnel lenses were applied to concentrate solar irradiation on a selective absorbing coat. Meanwhile two vertical axis rotors were used to cool the cold side of the thermoelectric power generator by catching the breeze. The effects of solar irradiation, temperature distribution, load resistance, wind speed, the maximum power and the electrical efficiency of the thermoelectric power generator were analyzed. When subjected to solar irradiation of 896.38 W/m2, the device generated a potential difference of 381.03 mV and a power output of 8.86 mW via thermoelectric generation. In addition, compared with the system without wind, the output power was increased by approximately 10.96% in our system. The low power wireless networks, used in wetland environments, could be operated by the thermoelectric power generated by the floating device. Besides, this system offers powering solution for self-power miniature devices that are applied in aqueous environment."
https://openalex.org/W3021770501,"c-Jun is a major component of the AP-1 transactivator complex. In this report, we demonstrated that AP-1 was activated by the expression of UL42, a human cytomegalovirus-encoded membrane protein that has two PPXY (PY) motifs and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). Although UL42 interacts with Itch, an ubiquitin E3 ligase, through the PY motifs, UL42 phosphorylated c-Jun and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the absence of any interaction with Itch. Experiments using mutated versions of UL42 suggest the importance of the carboxyl half (a.a. 52–124) of UL42 for the activation of the JNK signaling, while C-terminal TMD alone is not sufficient. Thus, we hypothesize that UL42 plays a role in the activation of JNK signaling in HCMV-infected cells. (118 words)."
https://openalex.org/W3022730453,"Modifying a soccer substitute’s pre-pitch-entry activities may represent an opportunity to maximise physical performance and minimise injury-risk following match-introduction. Using a professional team that has previously participated in substitute profiling research, this follow-up case study investigated the effects of a modified match-day protocol that included substitutes; 1) performing a new pre-match warm-up alongside members of the starting team (as opposed to a separate substitute-only warm-up), 2) participating in a staff-led half-time rewarm-up (as opposed to player-led half-time activities), and 3) receiving ongoing education focusing on the efficacy of (re)warm-up activities. English Championship substitutes (n = 15) were monitored using Micro-electromechanical Systems during 13 matches incorporating the modified practices (35 observations). On an individual player basis, data were organised into bouts of warm-up activity (pre-pitch-entry) and five min epochs of match-play (post-pitch-entry). Linear mixed modelling assessed the influence of ‘bout’ and ‘epoch’, position, and scoreline. Substitutes performed 3±1 rewarm-up bouts∙player-1∙match-1 between kick-off and pitch-entry, which were shorter (-17.2 to -27.1 min) and elicited less distance (-696 to -1257 m) than the pre-match warm-up (p≤0.001). Compared with previous data, heightened absolute movement responses were observed during the pre-match and staff-led half-time (re)warm-ups, alongside greater relative distances covered during player-led activities performed between kick-off and pitch-entry. Whilst less distance (-10%) was covered during the second versus first five min period following match-introduction, values remained higher than previously reported. Between pitch-entry and the end of the match, the scoreline improved and worsened following 26% and 11% of substitutions, respectively; a favourable record compared with existing observations. Acknowledging the likely contribution from external factors, this case study reports heightened movement profiles and improved match scorelines when pre-pitch-entry practices were modified. Practitioners should note the potential influence of match-day activities on the physical responses of soccer substitutes and, if deemed necessary, consider adapting their pre-pitch-entry routines accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W3023663570,"The efficacy of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) inactivated vaccines is mainly dependent on the integrity of the whole (146S) viral particles. If the intact capsids disassemble to 12S subunits, antibodies against internal-not protective epitopes, may be induced. Serological correlates with protection may be hampered if antibodies against internal epitopes are measured. Here we compared the performance of different ELISAs with the virus-neutralization test (VNT) that measures antibodies against exposed epitopes. Sera from pigs immunized with one dose of an expired commercial FMDV vaccine were used. This vaccine contained about 50% of O1/Campos and over 90% of A24/Cruzeiro strains total antigen as whole 146S particles. Specific-total antibodies were measured with the standard liquid-phase blocking ELISA (LPBE). We also developed an indirect ELISA (IE) using sucrose gradient purified 146S particles as capture antigen to titrate total antibodies, IgM, IgG1 and IgG2. A good correlation was found between VNT titers and IgG-ELISAs for A24/Cruzeiro, with the lowest correlation coefficient estimated for IgG2 titers. For O1/Campos, however, the presence of antibodies against epitopes different from those of the whole capsid, elicited by the presence of 12S particles in the vaccine, hampered the correlation between LPBE and VNT, which was improved by using purified O1/Campos 146S-particles for the liquid-phase of the LPBE. Interestingly, 146S particles but not 12S were efficiently bound to the ELISA plates, confirming the efficiency of the IE to detect antibodies against exposed epitopes. Our results indicate that any serological test assessing total antibodies or IgG1 against epitopes exposed in intact 146S-particles correlate with the levels of serum neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated pigs, and might potentially replace the VNT, upon validation. We recommend that antigen used for serological assays aimed to measure protective antibodies against FMDV should be controlled to ensure the preservation of 146S viral particles."
https://openalex.org/W3023783114,"The nonlinear dynamics of a bird-like flapping wing robot under randomly uncertain disturbances was studied in this study. The bird-like flapping wing robot was first simplified into a two-rod model with a spring connection. Then, the dynamic model of the robot under randomly uncertain disturbances was established according to the principle of moment equilibrium, and the disturbances were modeled in the form of bounded noise. Next, the energy model of the robot was established. Finally, numerical simulations and experiments were carried out based on the above models. The results show that the robot is more likely to deviate from its normal trajectory when the randomly uncertain disturbances are applied in a chaotic state than in a periodic state. With the increase of the spring stiffness under the randomly uncertain disturbances, the robot has a stronger ability to reject the disturbances. The mass center of the robot is vital to realize stable flights. The greater the amplitude of randomly uncertain disturbances, the more likely it is for the robot to be in a divergent state."

Scale change stable features are found by constructing an isometric differential Gaussian space, and a local binary pattern algorithm with extended statistics (ES-LBP), the Haar wavelet with over threshold detection and the Gabor filter algorithm with immune particle swarm optimization (IPSO) are used to represent the stable features as binary feature codes. Iris certification is performed by the Hamming distance. According to the certification results of three algorithms, the final result is obtained by multi-algorithm voting. Experiments with the JLU and CASIA iris libraries under the iris prerequisite conditions show that the correct recognition rate of this algorithm can reach a high level of 98% or more, indicating that this algorithm can improve the operation speed, accuracy and robustness of certification."

The realization that they have a role in regulating T-cell signaling pathways emerged from an analysis of mice lacking Sts expression. In particular, T cells isolated from Sts−/− mice display a pronounced hypersensitivity to T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. This is manifested by an increase in TCR-induced proliferation and cytokine production by mutant T cells relative to WT T cells (6Carpino N. Turner S. Mekala D. Takahashi Y. Zang H. Geiger T.L.

In recent years, it has been shown that the absence of Sts expression can substantially alter the outcome of a pathogen infection. Studies investigating the host immune response to systemic infection by the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans demonstrated that, unlike infected WT mice in which extensive fungal proliferation leads to progressive sepsis and rapid lethality, infected Sts−/− mice are substantially resistant (15Naseem S. Frank D. Konopka J.B. Carpino N. Protection from systemic Candida albicans infection by inactivation of the Sts phosphatases.Infect.

Sts−/− mice also display significantly increased survival following infection with Gram-negative Francisella tularensis (LVS) (16Parashar K. Kopping E. Frank D. Sampath V. Thanassi D.G. Carpino N.

Importantly, in response to both pathogens, enhanced microbial clearance within Sts−/− animals was apparent. These results indicate that Sts activity is linked to critical host anti-microbial pathways. The Sts phosphatases are distinguished from the large number of immunoregulatory protein-tyrosine phosphatases by a unique structure. They have an N-terminal ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain, a central Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a C-terminal histidine-phosphatase (HP) domain, which is named for two conserved catalytic histidines within the active site. The HP domain is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from the phosphatase domain of protein-tyrosine phosphatase enzymes (17Chen M.J. Dixon J.E. Manning G. Genomics and evolution of protein phosphatases.Sci. Signal. 2017; 10 (28400531): eaag179610.1126/scisignal.aag1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and instead bears a higher degree of homology to a group of structurally related enzymes that hydrolyze phosphate from small molecules such as phosphoglycerate and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (18Rigden D.J.

In addition to containing UBA, SH3, and HP domains, the Sts proteins possess a region spanning the UBA and SH3 domains that contains a 2H phosphoesterase motif (19Mazumder R. Iyer L.M. Vasudevan S. Aravind L. Detection of novel members, structure–function analysis and evolutionary classification of the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 (12466548): 5229-524310.1093/nar/gkf645Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The 2H phosphoesterase motif contains two conserved histidine residues that are essential for catalytic activity and defines a superfamily of enzymes whose members can be found in all three taxonomic domains. Although the substrates of many 2H phosphoesterases have not been definitely established, many family members exhibit phosphodiesterase activity and have been shown to hydrolyze cyclic phosphodiester bonds present on free nucleotides, oligonucleotides, or at the 3′ termini of RNA. Family members include human myelin 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) (20Myllykoski M. Raasakka A. Han H. Kursula P.

In spite of considerable differences in primary amino acid sequence, all 2H phosphoesterases have several important features in common. These features include a compact bilobed structure, an active site located within a narrow cleft between the two lobes, and a catalytic core formed in part by two conserved quartets of amino acids (the 2H phosphoesterase motif, HX(S/T)X, where X is any hydrophobic residue) that are arrayed in a 2-fold symmetric conformation with respect to one another (24Myllykoski M. Seidel L. Muruganandam G. Raasakka A. Torda A.E. Kursula P. Structural and functional evolution of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase.Brain Res. 2016; 1641 (26367445): 64-7810.1016/j.brainres.2015.09.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The presence of a putative 2H phosphoesterase motif within Sts prompted us to investigate its functional significance. We determined that each of the two invariant histidines within the Sts-1 2H phosphoesterase motif play an important role in the ability of Sts-1 to function as a negative regulator of cell signaling pathways. We also report the discovery of a novel phosphodiesterase (PDE) catalytic activity associated with Sts-1, derived from the region of Sts-1 located between the UBA and SH3 domains. This catalytic activity is both substrate-specific and stereoselective in nature and depends on the invariant histidines within the 2H phosphoesterase motif. Henceforth, we denote this region the Sts-1 PDE domain. Our results identify a novel enzyme activity associated with Sts-1 and link this novel catalytic activity to specific signaling effects. These findings broaden our understanding of the role that Sts-1 plays in establishing a balanced and productive immune response. The 2H phosphoesterase motif is characterized by two identical short amino acid sequences (HX(S/T)X, where X is a hydrophobic residue) that are spaced ∼80–85 amino acids apart. Both invariant histidine residues are thought to play an essential role in catalysis (25Lee J. Gravel M. Gao E. O'Neill R.C. Braun P.E.

The 2H-phosphoesterase domain of human Sts-1 (Sts-1PDE), located between the Sts-1 UBA and SH3 domains, was identified based on two histidine-containing tetrapeptide sequences, HITL and HVTL, that conform to the 2H-phosphoesterase consensus motif (Fig. 1A). Sts-2 and Sts evolutionary orthologues also contain an identical domain, with the Sts-2 PDE domain exhibiting 79% homology to hSts-1PDE and the corresponding region of Drosophila melanogaster Sts having 73% homology to hSts-1PDE (Fig. 1A). However, Sts-1PDE displays very limited homology to other enzymes of the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily, including human CNPase (20Myllykoski M. Raasakka A. Han H. Kursula P.

This is consistent with previous observations that diverse 2H phosphoesterase enzymes, aside from having the dual histidine–containing tetrapeptide motif in common, display very little overall sequence similarity. To determine whether Sts-1PDE is critical for Sts-1 intracellular functions, we generated cDNAs encoding two Sts-1 mutants, H126A and H212A, in which the conserved catalytic histidines of the 2H phosphoesterase motif were individually altered to alanine residues. We then examined signaling pathways known to be regulated by Sts-1. Within T cells, the Sts proteins negatively regulate proximal signaling pathways downstream of the TCR (6Carpino N. Turner S. Mekala D. Takahashi Y. Zang H. Geiger T.L. Doherty P. Ihle J.N.

Similar to Sts-1 H391N, Sts-1 H126A and H212A fail to suppress NFAT activation to the same extent as WT Sts-1 (Fig. 1B).

Signaling pathways downstream of Dectin-1 have been shown to be negatively regulated by the Sts proteins (11Frank D. Naseem S. Russo G.L. Li C. Parashar K. Konopka J.B. Carpino N. Phagocytes from mice lacking the Sts phosphatases have an enhanced antifungal response to Candida albicans.mBio. 2018; 9 (30018105): e00718-e0078210.1128/mBio.00782-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To evaluate a role for Sts-1 PDE domain conserved histidine residues in Sts-1–mediated suppression of C-type lectin receptor signaling, we reconstituted the Dectin-1–Syk signaling axis in 293T cells and compared the ability of WT Sts-1 versus PDE domain point mutants H126A or H212A to suppress NFAT activation. Whereas WT Sts-1 negatively regulated zymosan-induced NFAT activation, Sts-1 mutants H126A and H212A each failed to suppress NFAT activation, in spite of equivalent levels of protein expression (Fig. 1C). Similar to our observations with the TCR pathway, these results suggest that the conserved histidine residues of Sts-1PDE are necessary for Sts-1–mediated suppression of Dectin-1 signaling. Members of the 2H phosphoesterase family canonically utilize two catalytic histidine residues to cleave a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester linkage of a small molecule substrate. This activity is exemplified by the vertebrate brain 2′,3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) (20Myllykoski M. Raasakka A. Han H. Kursula P. Myelin 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase: active-site ligand binding and molecular conformation.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (22393399): e3233610.1371/journal.pone.0032336Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Raasakka A.

In the latter case, the product of the ester hydrolysis reaction is the nucleotide or oligonucleotide with a 2′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl group. To determine whether Sts-1PDE exhibits canonical PDE activity, we first tested whether the protein could hydrolyze the phosphodiester linkage in NADcP using a coupled assay that measures the production of 2′-NADP (35Sogin D.C. Cyclic NADP as a substrate for 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphohydrolase.J. Neurochem. 1976; 27 (12248): 1333-133710.1111/j.1471-4159.1976.tb02612.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We were unable to observe any enzyme activity for either the full-length Sts-1 protein or the isolated PDE domain, Sts-1PDE. We then developed and utilized an HPLC-based assay to monitor the products of NADcP esterolysis by Sts-1 or Sts-1PDE. Using this assay, we observed enzyme-dependent formation of a product peak over time (Fig. 2A). The product that we observed was the 3′-phosphate 3′-NADP, which results from hydrolysis of the 2′-ester linkage (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the kinetics of this reaction revealed that this activity saturated with a Km of 5.4 ± 0.4 mm and a kcat of 0.012 ± 0.003 s−1 (Fig. 2C). These results stand in contrast to human CNPase, which displays a Km of 533 ± 56 μM and a kcat of 940 ± 38 s−1 for the 3′-phosphodiestease activity that converts 2′,3′-cNADP to 2′-NADP (34Raasakka A. Myllykoski M. Laulumaa S. Lehtimaki M. Hartlein M. Moulin M. Kursula I. Kursula P. Determinants of ligand binding and catalytic activity in the myelin enzyme 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 (26563764): 1652010.1038/srep16520Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Overall, our results demonstrate that the PDE domain of Sts-1 possesses an enzyme-dependent 2′-phosphodiestease activity for a 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide substrate. To confirm the role of the conserved histidines in catalyzing the PDE reaction, we also measured the activity of the H126A and H212A mutants. Both the Sts-1 H126A and Sts-1 H212A had activities barely above the level of noise, turning over at less than 5% the rate of the WT protein (Fig. 2D). This is consistent with the proposed essential role in the catalytic mechanism for this pair of conserved histidine residues (25Lee J. Gravel M. Gao E. O'Neill R.C. Braun P.E. Identification of essential residues in 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase: chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role of cysteine and histidine residues in enzymatic activity.J.

Members of the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiesterase family of enzymes have been shown to hydrolyze the ester linkage on several types of small molecule, predominantly nucleotides and nucleic acids. To determine the breadth and specificity of substrates for Sts-1PDE, we tested over a dozen different nucleotides as possible substrates (Fig. S1). The nucleotides (listed in Table 1) included mononucleotides with 2′,3′- or 3′,5′-cyclic esters and several dinucleotides with varying linkages, including a number of known STING ligands (36Kato K. Omura H. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Cyclic GMP-AMP as an endogenous second messenger in innate immune signaling by cytosolic DNA.Annu. Rev.

Under the reaction conditions used, only NADcP was a substrate for Sts-1PDE (Table 1). Even 2′,3′-cAMP, which is structurally very similar to NADcP, was not turned over by the enzyme. Ligase activity (formation of any cyclic nucleotides or dinucleotides) was not observed for any of the monophosphates as substrates. Because Sts-1 possesses an HP domain, we also measured phosphatase activity in the context of Sts-1PDE and full-length Sts-1 protein. Although full-length Sts-1 displayed high phosphatase activity, Sts-1PDE exhibited no measureable p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP)–hydrolysis activity (Table 1). The PDE activity was not measurably different over a range of temperatures (20–40 °C), nor was it affected by preincubation of the enzyme with divalent cations. In sum, our results suggest that Sts-1PDE possesses a high degree of substrate selectivity with regard to its ability to target cyclic phosphorylated substrates.Table 1Substrates tested in this workSubstrate tested (concentration)Sts-1PDESts-1NADcP+ (1 mm)0.13 min−10.065 min−1pNPP (phosphatase substrate) (1 mm)N.D.aN.D., no detectable activity at the concentration tested.98 min−12´,3´-cAMP (1 mm)1.1 × 10−4 min−1N.D.2´,3´-cGMP (1 mm)N.D.N.T.bN.T., this substrate was not tested with this enzyme.2´,3´-cCMP (1 mm)N.D.N.T.3´,5´-cAMP (1 mm)N.D.N.T.3´,5´-cGMP (1 mm)N.D.N.T.pApA (3´,5´) (1 mm)N.D.N.T.c[A(2´,5´)pG(3´,5´)p] (1 mm)N.D.N.T.c[A(3´,5´)pG(2´,5´)p] (1 mm)N.D.N.T.c[A(2´,5´)pA(2´,5´)p] (1 mm)N.D.N.T.c[A(2´,5´)pG(2´,5´)p] (1 mm)N.D.N.T.Cyclic ADP-ribose (1 mm)N.D.N.T.(ligase substrate) (1 mm) 3′ AMPN.D.N.T.(ligase substrate) (1 mm) 3′ GMPN.D.N.T.Substrate (rArArUrArA>P) (20 μm)cNote that a lower concentration was used for the cyclic RNA substrate because of poor solubility of the substrate. 2′3′-cRNA4.4 × 10−3 min−15.6 × 10−4 min−1a N.D., no detectable activity at the concentration tested.b N.T., this substrate was not tested with this enzyme.c Note that a lower concentration was used for the cyclic RNA substrate because of poor solubility of the substrate. Open table in a new tab As many of the cyclic PDE enzymes act upon nucleic acid substrates, we next tested the activity of Sts-1PDE on a 2′,3′-cyclic RNA substrate. We treated an RNA 5-mer (rArArUrArA) bearing a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate terminus with Sts-1PDE and examined the resulting products with our HPLC-based assay. A new peak that co-eluted with the 3′-phosphate standard was observed (Fig. 3A). This confirms that the Sts-1PDE has 2′,3′-cyclic PDE activity that selectively cleaves the 2′-phosphoester bond. In addition, this shows that this enzyme can take both a small molecule nucleotide (NADcP) and an RNA oligonucleotide as a substrate. Although solubility limitations of the RNA substrate preclude a complete investigation, the kinetics of this reaction were observed to be relatively slow. To further analyze substrate selectivity,"

Alcohol use while driving is a major contributor to road traffic injuries (RTI). We need to understand the culture and perception of drink-driving in this setting to understand why people continue to drink drive and allow policymakers to develop more effective ways to address drink-driving behavior. This study aims to qualitatively determine what injury patients, their families, and community advisory board members in Tanzania believe about drink-driving to help inform policies to address this problem.The semi-structured focus group was designed based on the grounded theory and assessed using thematic analysis. Focus groups participants were a convenience sample of injury patients, their families, and community advisory board (CAB) members. Analysis was iterative throughout the study. All transcripts were coded using a thematic narrative approach. Representative quotes for each theme were then selected based on comparative analysis of coding with input from research team members.A total of ten focus groups were conducted (4 patient, 4 family, and 2 CAB) with a total of 104 participants (37 females and 67 males). The normalization of drinking among drivers has allowed this behavior to become ingrained in the culture. Participants expressed notions that passengers are responsible for their own safety, rather than drivers being responsible for their passengers. Most participants believe it is a citizen's duty to inform the police of suspected drink-driving, however there were differing opinions about how effective informed police officers can be in practice. Focus group discussions between all three population types highlighted major themes of 'drinking is ingrained in boda boda driver culture', 'individuals have a personal responsibility to address drink-driving', and a 'police enforcement on drink-driving is necessary'.Normalization of drink-driving in commercial driver culture creates a dangerous environment for passengers which can be mitigated by education and health promotion. As most passengers already take personal responsibility for their own road traffic safety, they may be likely to make use of safe ride options, if available. While legislation is in place against drink-driving, police officers need to be empowered with appropriate training and funding to enforce them."
https://openalex.org/W3023545885,"Trust is essential for social interactions, cooperation and social order. Research has shown that social status and common group memberships are important determinants of receiving and reciprocating trust. However, social status and group membership can coincide or diverge–with potentially different effects. Our study contributes to the existing literature on the role of status and group membership by testing two separate trust-generating mechanisms against each other. We examine if individuals tend to place trust in high-status groups (irrespective of their own group membership) or, rather, if they tend to trust others with whom they share a common group membership. We assume that status group membership is signalled by cultural (musical) taste. This operationalization follows the theoretical reasoning of Bourdieu who argues that it is, above all, musical taste that classifies persons of different status. By demonstrating their “legitimate” cultural taste, upper-class members distinguish themselves from the middle and lower classes and signal their social status, thereby creating awe, respect and an air of trustworthiness. We report evidence from online experiments with incentivized trust games, which enable us to separate the two trust-generating mechanisms. We find no evidence that persons with “legitimate” tastes are generally trusted more. Instead, our results clearly demonstrate ingroup favouritism towards persons with a similar taste. Participants place more trust in members of their own group and expect them to be more trustworthy. In other words: members of taste-based groups trust each other more than members of different-taste-based groups. Interestingly, this group-based trust is not always justified inasmuch as received trust is not necessarily reciprocated more strongly by own group members. This suggests that ingroup favouritism is, at least in part, driven by false beliefs."
https://openalex.org/W3022933975,"Fluorescent reporters are an important tool for monitoring dynamics of bacterial populations at the single cell and community level. While there are a large range of reporter constructs available-particularly for common model organisms like E. coli-fewer options exist for other species, including E. faecalis, a gram-positive opportunistic pathogen. To expand the potential toolkit available for E. faecalis, we exchanged the original fluorescent reporter in a previously developed plasmid (pBSU101) with one of eight fluorescent reporters and confirmed that all constructs exhibited detectable fluorescence in single E. faecalis cells and mixed biofilm communities. To identify promising constructs for bulk-level experiments, we then measured the fluorescence spectra from E. faecalis populations in microwell plate (liquid) cultures during different phases of aerobic growth. Cultures showed density- and reporter-specific variations in fluorescent signal, though spectral signatures of all reporters become clear in late-exponential and stationary-phase populations. Based on these results, we identified six pairs of reporters that can be combined with simple spectral unmixing to accurately estimate population composition in 2-strain mixtures at or near stationary phase. This approach offers a simple and scalable method for selection and competition experiments in simple two-species populations under aerobic growth conditions. Finally, we incorporated codon-optimized variants of blue (BFP) and red (RFP) reporters and show that they lead to increased fluorescence in exponentially growing cells. As a whole, the results inform the scope of application of different reporters and identify both single reporters and reporter pairs that are promising for fluorescence-based assays at bulk and single-cell levels in E. faecalis."
https://openalex.org/W3022173672,"Background Creating National Sanitary City (CNSC) promotes appearance, environment sanitation and public health including vector management of cities in China. However, vector management especially mosquito management and the related administrative productivity of Patriotic Health Campaign System (PHCS) of National Sanitary Cities (NSCs) were questioned by many pest control professionals and citizens. In this study, we studied mosquito management of NSCs taking Wuhan as an example. The study aimed to (1) determine the distribution and abundance of immature mosquito habitats in built-up areas of Wuhan and (2) better understand the related administration procedure in CNSC. Methods Immature mosquito habitat surveillance was carried out in randomly selected premises of driving schools (DSs), schools or kindergartens (SKs), property management residential areas (PMRAs), construction sites (CSs), wide roads with storm drains (WRSDs) and urban creeks (UCs) in built-up areas of Wuhan from July to October 2015 followed by questionnaire interviews with one each of premise occupants and district departments responsible for mosquito management in these premises. Results Total of 64.1 km of route were inspected in 36 DSs, 36 SKs, 36 PMRAs, 36 CSs and 36 segments of WRSD and 2,158 potential mosquito habitats with 749 (35%) mosquito-positive habitats were found. The route index (RI) was 11.7, which was 14.6 times higher than the grade C criteria for vector density control (RI = 0.8 positive habitats/km) in CNSC. Occupants of 36 DSs, 36 SKs, 36 PMRAs, 34 CSs were interviewed and 77% of them reported no difference in mosquito infestation in their premises since 2013 and 80% of them knew about the responsibility and arrangements of PHCS of mosquito management in their premises. Only 15% had the awareness of larval source reduction strategy and 14% had implemented it. Receipt the electronic/paper edition of CNSC vector management specifications from the PHCS was very low (13%) and an official notification or bulletin for rectification mosquito-positive habitats was also very low (5%). Of the 75 responsible district departments interviewed, about half (55%) reported that they had held training courses/meetings related to CNSC vector management, the majority (96%) reported that they had not carried out independent on-site supervision of premises under their jurisdiction. No differences in larval indices were found between premises which were administrative intervened and with no administrative intervention. Conclusions The administrative intervention of PHCS had not evidently improved mosquito management of the premises in built-up areas in Wuhan. It is a violation of the original intention of the National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee in organizing CNSC programs. To combat mosquito borne diseases, and to improve the quality of life of residents, we recommend that PHCS honestly reveals defects in urban mosquito management and seriously takes those exposed defects. The PHCS should strengthen Patriotic Health Campaign activities by strict adherence to NSC standards. Further research on sustained promotion of urban mosquito management of NSCs, which focus on effective administration, as well as on improvement of related sectors of NSC standards should be carried out."
https://openalex.org/W3022296570,"Background About every tenth household across Europe is unable to meet payment obligations and living expenses on an ongoing basis and is thus considered over-indebted. Previous research suggests that over-indebtedness reflects a potential cause and consequence of psychosomatic health problems and limited access to care. However, it is unclear whether those affected discuss their financial problems with general practitioners. Therefore, this study examined patient-physician communication about financial problems in general practice among over-indebted individuals. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among clients of 70 debt advice agencies in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, in 2017. We assessed the prevalence of patient-physician communication about financial problems and its association with patient characteristics using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Of 699 individuals who returned the questionnaire (response rate:50.2%), we included 598 respondents enrolled in statutory health insurance with complete outcome data in the analyses. Results Conversations about financial problems with general practitioners were reported by 22.6% (n = 135) of respondents. Individuals with a high educational level were less likely to report such conversations than those with medium educational level (aOR 0.11; 95%CI 0.01–0.83) after adjustment for other sociodemographic characteristics, health status and measures of financial distress. Those without a migrant background(aOR 2.09; 95%CI 1.32–3.32), the chronically ill(aOR 1.90; 95%CI 1.16–3.13) and individuals who reported high financial distress(aOR 2.15; 95%CI 1.22–3.78) and cutting on necessities to pay for medications(aOR 1.86; 95%CI 1.12–3.09) were more likely to discuss financial problems than their counterparts. Conclusions Few over-indebted individuals discussed financial problems with their general practitioner. Patients’ health status, coping strategies and perception of financial distress might contribute to variations in disclosure of financial problems. Thus, enhancing communication and screening by routine assessment of financial problems in clinical practice can help to identify vulnerable patients and promote access to health care and social services and well-being for all."
https://openalex.org/W3022938678,"Prompt sepsis treatment is associated with improved outcomes but requires a complex series of actions by multiple clinicians. We investigated whether simply reorganizing emergency department (ED) care to expedite patients' initial evaluation was associated with shorter sepsis door-to-antibiotic times.Patients eligible for this retrospective study received IV antibiotics and demonstrated acute organ failure after presenting to one of three EDs in Utah. On May 1, 2016, the intervention ED instituted ""swarming"" as the default model for initial evaluation of all mid- and low-acuity patients. Swarming involved simultaneous patient evaluation by the ED physician, nurse, and technician followed by a team discussion of the initial care plan. Care was unchanged at the two control EDs. A 30-day wash-in period separated the baseline (May 16, 2015 to April 15, 2016) and post-intervention (May 16, 2016 to November 15, 2016) analysis periods. We conducted a quasi-experimental analysis comparing door-to-antibiotic time for sepsis patients at the intervention ED after versus before care reorganization, applying difference-in-differences methods to control for trends in door-to-antibiotic time unrelated to the studied intervention and multivariable regression to adjust for patient characteristics.The analysis included 3,230 ED sepsis patients, including 1,406 from the intervention ED. Adjusted analyses using difference-in-differences methods to control for temporal trends unrelated to the studied intervention revealed no significant change in door-to-antibiotic time after care reorganization (-7 minutes, 95% CI -20 to 6 minutes, p = 0.29). Multivariable pre/post analyses using data only from the intervention ED overestimated the magnitude and statistical significance of outcome changes associated with ED care reorganization.Implementation of an ED care model involving parallel multidisciplinary assessment and early team discussion of the care plan was not associated with improvements in mid- and low-acuity sepsis patients' door-to-antibiotic time after accounting for changes in the outcome unrelated to the studied intervention."

Human T lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus known for causing diseases, especially in muscle and white blood cells, in approximately 5% of patients. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the potential effects of an HPgV-1 infection in patients carrying HTLV-1 in the state of Pará in the North Region of Brazil.A group of HTLV-1 carriers was compared to healthy controls. Blood samples were collected, data from medical regards were collected, and a questionnaire was administered. HPgV-1 and HTLV-1 positivity was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The data were analyzed to correlate the effects of HPgV-1 coinfection in HTLV-1 carriers.A total of 158 samples were included in the study: 74 HTLV-1-positive patients (46,8%) and 84 healthy controls (53,2%). The overall HPgV-1 positivity rate was 7.6% (12/158), resulting in a prevalence of 5.4% (4/74) and 9.5% (8/84) in HTLV-1 carriers and healthy controls, respectively. No significant differences were found when comparing any clinical or demographic data between groups.This study indicated that the prevalence of HPgV-1 infection is low in HTLV-1 carriers in Belém, Pará, and probably does not alter the clinical course of HTLV-1 infection, however, further studies are still needed."
