https://openalex.org/W2017302575,The carbon-13/carbon-12 ratios of the carbonate and collagen fractions of bone of the sympatric hyrax species Procavia johnstoni and Heterohyrax brucei indicate that the former obtains most of its diet by grazing while the latter is primarily a browser. The carbon-13/carbon-12 ratios of these fractions in fossil bone will record information about diet if they have not been altered during diagenesis.

This extraordinary (13)C depletion, together with characteristics of the inorganic carbon pool, indicates that lake respiration as well as surrounding soil respiration provide important carbon sources for plankton production in this lake."
https://openalex.org/W2021008250,"Field experiments on breeding populations of lark buntings (Calamospiza melanocorys) in South Dakota support the hypothesis that polygyny is promoted by a high variance in quality among male territories. Among these birds protection of the nest site from solar radiation is the major indicator of quality: nestling survival was significantly correlated with nest-site cover, and experimental increase of shading resulted in higher reproductive success. Males with superior territories attracted two mates, whereas those with poor territories failed to attract any. Secondary females had fledging success at least equal to that of contemporaneous monogamous pairs. On the sole basis of a shading score for each territory, the mating status of males (polygynous, monogamous, or bachelor) was predicted accurately in new areas of Colorado and North Dakota before females arrived."

Figures are presented for the agricultural and industrial phases. The industrial phase is always more energy-intensive, consuming from 60 to 75 percent of the total energy. Sugarcane is the more efficient crop for ethyl alcohol production, followed by sweet sorghum and cassava from a net energy viewpoint. The utilization of sweet sorghum stems might increase the total energy gain from this crop to almost the same level as sugarcane. Cassava has a lower energy gain at the present state of agriculture in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W1965242339,"According to analyses of field samples, social inhibition of maturation is at work in natural populations of the variable platyfish, Xiphophorus variatus. In the laboratory, adult males inhibit the maturation of juveniles; the inhibition is overcome as the juveniles increase in size. The proportion of maturing males in any field collection is related to the number of adult males present and the size of the juveniles. The more adults, the fewer maturing males are present; the larger the average juvenile, the greater the number of males maturing. The evolution of this system is best understood in terms of individual selection, but consequences of the system buffer the population against the effects of predation."
https://openalex.org/W2055714234,"Geologic evidence, supported by infinite carbon-14 dates and Middle Stone Age cultural associations, indicates that two open-air shell middens recently found at Sea Harvest and Hoedjies Punt, Saldanha Bay, South Africa, date from the terminal part of the Last Interglacial, about 70,000 to 60,000 years ago. These middens are among the oldest known records for systematic human exploitation of marine resources anywhere in the world. The faunal contents of the middens suggest that the Middle Stone Age people who accumulated them utilized marine resources less intensively than their Later Stone Age successors in similar coastal settings."

https://openalex.org/W2057140786,"The racemate and optically pure enantiomers of 9-(2-cyclopenten-1yl)nonyl acetate have been synthesized and shown to mimic certain biological properties of (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate. European corn borers and red-banded leaf rollers respond differently to the racemate and to the enantiomers in precopulatory behavior bioassay. The responses demonstrate the presence of two stereospecific chemoreceptors, show the chiral character of these receptors, and define the conformation of carbon atoms 10 to 14 of (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate in these receptors."

This is evidenced by the U.S. trade deficit of $9 billion in this market in 1977. The synergistic approach of Japan, Germany, Russia, and other countries to research, development, and demonstration among government, academic, and industrial groups is paying big dividends in vital U.S. markets. This article outlines a specific solution in terms of a U.S. national research policy for light machinery and robotics."

https://openalex.org/W1966234169,"Abstract An outline is given of some of the steps which in the last ten years have led to an understanding of many of the properties of conduction and valence bands in non-crystalline materials. The concept of a mobility edge is described and some of the experimental evidence for its existence is presented. A discussion is given of the nature of ‘states in the gap’, thought of as deep donors or acceptors. These pin the Fermi energy and act as recombination centres. A distinction is made between materials such as silicon or germanium with fourfold co-ordination and those like As2Te3 or SiO2, where for the chalcogen (Te or O) co-ordination is twofold; for the former an electron in a deep state produces only moderate distortion of the lattice, for the latter the distortion is large. Photoluminescence and other properties of chalcogenides are discussed in terms of a recent model of ‘charged dangling bonds’. It is suggested that free holes in As2Te3 and As2Se3 are not self-trapped but that in SiO2 they are. Fi..."
