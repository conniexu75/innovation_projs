https://openalex.org/W2171391341,"The NAD-dependent deacetylase SIR2 and the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 regulate lifespan in model organisms, such as yeast and C. elegans. Here we show that the mammalian SIR2 ortholog SIRT1 deacetylates and represses the activity of the forkhead transcription factor Foxo3a and other mammalian forkhead factors. This regulation appears to be in the opposite direction from the genetic interaction of SIR2 with forkhead in C. elegans. By restraining mammalian forkhead proteins, SIRT1 also reduces forkhead-dependent apoptosis. The inhibition of forkhead activity by SIRT1 parallels the effect of this deacetylase on the tumor suppressor p53. We speculate how down-regulating these two classes of damage-responsive mammalian factors may favor long lifespan under certain environmental conditions, such as calorie restriction."
https://openalex.org/W2053833990,"Using high-density oligonucleotide arrays representing essentially all nonrepetitive sequences on human chromosomes 21 and 22, we map the binding sites in vivo for three DNA binding transcription factors, Sp1, cMyc, and p53, in an unbiased manner. This mapping reveals an unexpectedly large number of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) regions, with a minimal estimate of 12,000 for Sp1, 25,000 for cMyc, and 1600 for p53 when extrapolated to the full genome. Only 22% of these TFBS regions are located at the 5' termini of protein-coding genes while 36% lie within or immediately 3' to well-characterized genes and are significantly correlated with noncoding RNAs. A significant number of these noncoding RNAs are regulated in response to retinoic acid, and overlapping pairs of protein-coding and noncoding RNAs are often coregulated. Thus, the human genome contains roughly comparable numbers of protein-coding and noncoding genes that are bound by common transcription factors and regulated by common environmental signals."
https://openalex.org/W1996826558,"The accumulation of unfolded proteins elicits a cellular response that triggers both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signaling events. PERK-dependent activation of NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is critical for survival signaling during this response; however, the mechanism whereby Nrf2 confers a protective advantage to stressed cells remains to be defined. We now demonstrate that Nrf2 activation contributes to the maintenance of glutathione levels, which in turn functions as a buffer for the accumulation of reactive oxygen species during the unfolded protein response. The deleterious effects of Nrf2 or PERK deficiencies could be attenuated by the restoration of cellular glutathione levels or Nrf2 activity. In addition, the inhibition of reactive oxygen species production attenuated apoptotic induction following endoplasmic reticulum stress. Our data suggest that perturbations in cellular redox status sensitize cells to the harmful effects of endoplasmic reticulum stress, but that other factors are essential for apoptotic commitment.

Mammalian cells possess a signaling network that senses the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; ATF, activating transcription factor; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α; Nrf2, NF-E2-related factor-2; CHOP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; HA, hemagglutinin; GCLC, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase); NQO1, NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase-1; DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone; DNPH, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine; BH3, Bcl2-homology domain 3. This signaling pathway, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), is induced by agents that affect calcium homeostasis and protein glycosylation or through physiological stresses such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation; all of these stresses share a common capacity to disrupt the folding of proteins within the ER (1Kaufman R.J.

The signaling network consists of three related transmembrane protein kinases (Ire1α, Ire1β, and PERK), a transmembrane transcription factor (ATF6), and a transmembrane protease (caspase-12), which together coordinate cellular responses following UPR activation (1Kaufman R.J.

Ire1-dependent signaling in concert with ATF6 activation promotes expression of ER-localized chaperones, which facilitate the restoration of proper protein folding within the ER (6Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). UPR-mediated PERK activation impedes protein translation via phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) (7Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Independent of its translational regulatory capacity, PERK-dependent signals elicit the activation of the prosurvival transcription factor NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) via site-specific phosphorylation (10Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannink M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7198-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). PERK belongs to an eIF2α kinase family that includes the interferon-inducible, RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, the heme-regulated kinase HRI, and GCN2 (11Berlanga J.J. Santoyo J. De Haro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Of these, PERK function appears to be specifically required for the cellular response to ER stress (13Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Following UPR activation, PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser51 attenuates translation of a majority of cellular proteins (7Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar, 9Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell.

Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). The fact that mice harboring either a homozygous knock-in of a non-phosphorylatable eIF2α allele or a targeted deletion of PERK exhibit defects in glucose homeostasis and postnatal lethality (15Scheuner D.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3864-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) demonstrates that this translational regulation program is critical for organismal and cellular homeostasis. Nrf2 activity has also been implicated in the promotion of cell survival following ER stress (10Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannink M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7198-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is localized in the cytoplasm through an interaction with the BTB (broad complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-Brac) domain-containing protein Keap1 (18Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). PERK-dependent phosphorylation leads to the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and increased transcription of Nrf2 target genes (10Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannink M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7198-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Previous work has revealed that cells deficient in Nrf2 (Nrf2-/-) display increased apoptosis and decreased survival in response to tunicamycin treatment (10Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannink M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7198-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), demonstrating that Nrf2 function is critical for cell survival following ER stress. Although the importance of Nrf2 signaling in response to ER stress is established, the mechanism whereby Nrf2 promotes cell survival remains undefined. Nrf2 regulates transcriptional induction of Phase II detoxifying enzymes following exposure of cells to agents that promote the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (19Hayes J.D. McMahon M. Cancer Lett. 2001; 174: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Loss of Nrf2 through targeted gene deletion decreases cell survival in response to oxidative stress (20Chan K. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12731-12736Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition, glutathione levels are markedly decreased in Nrf2-/- cells compared with wild-type counterparts under conditions of stress and even under normal growth conditions (21Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 22Leung L. Kwong M. Hou S. Lee C. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48021-48029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Notably, cells deficient in either PERK or an Nrf2 heterodimeric partner, ATF4, also bear an increased oxidative stress burden (23Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that perturbations in redox homeostasis are associated with ER stress and that PERK-dependent signals, including those that promote Nrf2 activation, function to buffer the increased oxidative stress burden associated with UPR activation. We now demonstrate that ROS accumulation and an increased oxidative stress burden sensitize Nrf2-/- cells to apoptosis following UPR induction. Interference with ROS production via treatment of cells with ROS scavengers or restoration of glutathione levels delayed apoptosis, but was not sufficient to ablate ER stress-mediated cell death. These results suggest a model wherein ROS production sensitizes cells to ER stress, thereby contributing to apoptosis in cells deficient in components involved in signaling from the stressed ER. Tissue Culture Conditions and Plasmids—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, nonessential amino acids, β-mercaptoethanol, and glutamine (Mediatech, Inc.). To derive ρ zero cells, wild-type and Nrf2-/- murine embryo fibroblasts (20Chan K. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12731-12736Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) immortalized via a standard 3T9 protocol (24Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell. Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, nonessential amino acids, glutamine, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm uridine, and 100 ng/ml ethidium bromide (25King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). During glucose deprivation, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose (Invitrogen) and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Plasmids encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-Nrf2, Myc-Keap1, and MafG have been described previously (10Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannink M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7198-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells proliferating on glass coverslips were transfected and treated as described in text. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, in phosphate-buffered saline. The HA epitope was detected with monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG (Vector Labs, Inc.). DNA was detected with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Cells were visualized using a Nikon microscope fitted with appropriate filters. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—10 μg of cell extract (lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 4 mm dithiothreitol) was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5 mm dithiothreitol, and the indicated antibody. Following the incubation, a consensus antioxidant response element oligomer (10Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannink M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7198-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were resolved on native gels, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Annexin V Staining and Clonogenic Survival Assays—Cells proliferating on glass coverslips were left untreated, were treated with tunicamycin (5 μg/ml), or were cultured in glucose-free medium in the absence or presence of 5 mm N-acetylcysteine or 1 mm cysteine for the indicated intervals. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Annexin V antibody and propidium iodide (Pharmingen) and examined by fluorescence and light microscopy. Annexin V-positive/propidium iodide-negative cells are expressed as the percentage of total cells. For colony outgrowth assays, cells were plated at 2 × 104/60-mm dish; and after 24 h, they were left untreated, were treated with tunicamycin (5 μg/ml), or were cultured in glucose-free medium for the indicated intervals. Following treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, refed with complete medium, and allowed to grow for 7 days. Cells were visualized with Giemsa stain (Sigma). Immunoblotting, Cellular Fractionation, and Immunoprecipitation— For detection of phosphorylated eIF2α and total eIF2α, cells were lysed in 1% SDS, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Osmonics, Inc.), total eIF2α and phosphorylated eIF2α (Cell Signaling) were detected by immunoblotting. For detection of CHOP, lysates from wild-type and Nrf2-/- fibroblasts left untreated or cultured in glucose-free medium for 4 h or from NIH-3T3 cells were prepared in EBC buffer, transfected as indicated, and treated with tunicamycin. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, CHOP was detected using an anti-CHOP polyclonal antibody (F-168, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To collect nuclear extracts, wild-type and PERK-deficient (PERK-/-) fibroblasts were cultured in glucose-free medium for the indicated intervals. Nuclei were collected in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% IGEPAL and in buffer containing 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 20% glycerol and stored in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 20% glycerol. To detect total Nrf2 levels, wild-type and PERK-/- fibroblasts were lysed in EBC buffer. Nrf2 was precipitated with an anti-Nrf2 polyclonal antibody (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with an anti-Nrf2 polyclonal antibody. All buffers were supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate. Purity of nuclear extracts was routinely monitored via immunoblotting of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (nuclear) and β-tubulin (cytoplasmic). Northern and Southern Blotting—RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA immobilized on nylon membranes (Osmonics, Inc.) was hybridized with 32P-labeled probes specific for the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC; γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase), NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), CHOP, or γ-actin. Signals were detected by phosphorimaging. To verify ρ zero status, genomic DNA was collected from parental cells and from cells cultured in the presence of ethidium bromide and digested with SpeI. Digested DNA immobilized on nylon membranes was hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe specific for cytochrome c oxidase-2 (primers 5′-CCTACCCATTCCAACTTGGTC and 5′-CCACAAATTTCAGAGCATTGG). Signals were detected by phosphorimaging. Detection of ROS and Glutathione—To measure total glutathione and GSSG levels, cells were grown in 6-well plates and treated as indicated. Cells were scraped into glutathione assay buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)) with 0.1% Triton X-100. Total protein was measured using the BCA assay kit (Pierce), and all results were normalized according to protein concentration. Proteins were precipitated with 5% 5-sulfosalicylic acid, and samples were assayed following dilution of 5-sulfosalicylic acid to <0.1%. Glutathione measurements were completed in a reaction mixture containing cell lysates in 15 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.2 mm NADPH, and 1.0 unit/ml glutathione reductase (26Baker M.A. Cerniglia G.J. Zaman A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in 96-well plates and measured at 405 nm over 5 min using SoftMax software and an automated plate reader. In the rescue experiments, Nrf2-/- or PERK-/- fibroblasts were transfected with an empty vector or with a vector encoding HA-Nrf2 or Nrf2 containing a mutant nuclear localization signal, and wild-type fibroblasts were transfected with an empty vector. Total glutathione levels were then measured as described above. To measure oxidized glutathione levels, reduced glutathione was derivatized following protein precipitation using 2-vinylpyridine, and reactions were then carried out as described above. All experiments were carried out in duplicate and measured in triplicate. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. To detect endogenous peroxide production, cells were left untreated or were treated with tunicamycin (5 μg/ml) for the indicated intervals in the presence of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF) fluorescent dye (10 μm; Molecular Probes, Inc.). Cells were harvested, and fluorescence emission at 520 nm was measured using a fluorometer with an automated plate reader. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and measured in duplicate. The presence of carbonyl-modified cellular proteins was detected using the Oxyblot kit (Chemicon International, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated as indicated and lysed in EBC buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Carbonyl groups were derivatized to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP) via the addition of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE; and following transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the presence of DNP was detected using an antibody specific for DNP. Control reactions were carried out in parallel using non-DNPH-treated extracts to confirm the specificity of the antibody. Activation of the Nrf2 Transcription Factor and Nrf2 Target Genes in Response to Glucose Deprivation—We previously demonstrated that Nrf2 is activated following a pharmacologically induced UPR via PERK-mediated phosphorylation (10Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannink M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7198-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). To determine whether Nrf2 participates in a physiological response to ER stress, we examined PERK-dependent regulation of Nrf2 in cells deprived of glucose. Although glucose starvation affects global cellular metabolism, a more proximal effect is the interference with proper protein glycosylation in the ER (2Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Initially, we examined the kinetics of UPR activation in wild-type and Nrf2-/- mouse fibroblasts (20Chan K. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12731-12736Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) following glucose starvation. UPR activation of PERK results in phosphorylation of both eIF2α and Nrf2 and a concomitant increase in expression of the CHOP transcription factor (7Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar, 9Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannink M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7198-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 14Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). eIF2α phosphorylation was evident in both wild-type and Nrf2-/- cells by 1–2 h of glucose starvation (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3 and 6–8). These data demonstrate that the UPR and, more specifically, PERK activation occur following glucose restriction in Nrf2-/- cells. Strong CHOP accumulation was also noted in both cell types following glucose limitation (Fig. 1B). We noted that the CHOP protein was present under basal conditions in Nrf2-/- cells (compare lanes 1 and 3), albeit at levels lower than in stressed cells. This result suggests that Nrf2 might function directly or indirectly as a negative regulator of CHOP expression. Consistent with this, we noted increased kinetics of CHOP mRNA accumulation in Nrf2-/- fibroblasts following ER stress relative to that in wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1–5 and 6–10). In addition, although Nrf2 expression alone had a minimal impact on CHOP protein levels, we found that expression of Nrf2 along with its heterodimeric partner MafG (27Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) greatly attenuated CHOP induction following treatment of cells with tunicamycin (Fig. 1D). Similar results were observed when Nrf2 was co-expressed with ATF4, another Nrf2 binding partner (28He C.H. Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results suggest that Nrf2 negatively regulates CHOP expression both basally and in response to ER stress. Additional work will be required to assess whether Nrf2 can directly regulate CHOP gene expression. UPR-dependent activation via glycosylation inhibitors or perturbations in ER calcium concentration promotes PERK-dependent phosphorylation and directs the nuclear accumulation of transcriptionally active Nrf2 (10Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannink M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7198-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by virtue of its interaction with Keap1; following stress, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1, whereupon it translocates into the nucleus (18Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). To assess Nrf2 regulation in cells deprived of glucose, NIH-3T3 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA-Nrf2 and Myc-Keap1. In unstressed cells, HA-Nrf2 was exclusively cytoplasmic (Fig. 1E, panel a). Within 1 h of glucose deprivation, a significant fraction of HA-Nrf2 was nuclear (panel d) and remained nuclear for at least 2 h of glucose deprivation (panel g). We also assessed endogenous Nrf2 nuclear localization in wild-type and PERK-/- fibroblasts (13Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells cultured in complete or glucose-free medium for the indicated intervals. Nrf2 nuclear accumulation was assessed by immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblot analysis. Nrf2 nuclear accumulation was observed upon glucose restriction in wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 1F, lanes 2 and 3), but not in PERK-/- fibroblasts (lanes 6 and 7). As a control, total Nrf2 levels in wild-type and PERK-/- fibroblasts were measured during the course of glucose deprivation (Fig. 1G). Basal Nrf2 levels were comparable in the two cell lines (compare lanes 1 and 5), and Nrf2 levels were constant in the PERK-/- cells (lanes 5–7). We did note slightly higher Nrf2 levels in wild-type cells after 1 h of glucose treatment (compare lanes 1 and 2). This change may be the result of reported increased Nrf2 accumulation following stress induction (29Stewart D. Killeen E. Naquin R. Alam S. Alam J. J. Biol.

Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3190) Google Scholar), following glucose restriction. Both GCLC and NQO1 were induced following glucose limitation in wild-type cells (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 4), but not in Nrf2-/- fibroblasts (lanes 6–10). Consistent with PERK being a requisite proximal activator of Nrf2, induction of neither GCLC nor NQO1 was observed in PERK-/- fibroblasts (lanes 11–15). The increased levels of GCLC and NQO1 seen in PERK-/- fibroblasts may be a result of transient Nrf2 activation in response to normal cellular stresses (32Hayes J.D. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McMahon M. Sun C. Moffat G.J. Wolf C.R. Yamamoto M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Increased Sensitivity to ER Stress Correlates with Increased Oxidative Stress Burden—To determine the impact of Nrf2 deficiency on cell survival following ER stress induced by transient glucose restriction, wild-type and Nrf2-/- fibroblasts were plated at low density, cultured in normal or glucose-free medium for 8 or 16 h, and then refed with complete glucose-containing medium. Cells were allowed to grow for 7 days, at which point colonies were visualized with Giemsa stain. Nrf2 deficiency greatly diminished the ability of cells to survive glucose restriction (Fig. 3A). This result demonstrates that Nrf2 deficiency increases cell sensitivity to the pro-apoptotic effects of nutrient restriction. Consistent with this, Nrf2-/- fibroblasts also exhibited increased levels of Annexin V staining following glucose restriction (Fig. 3, B and C, triangles). We next considered the possibility that Nrf2-/- fibroblasts might exhibit reduced levels of glutathione following ER stress given that they are deficient in GCLC and NQO1 production. Nrf2-/- fibroblasts exhibited lower basal levels of glutathione compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4, A and B, compare black and hatched bars). In addition, a rapid decrease in glutathione levels (to nearly 50% of that in untreated cells) was observed in response to glucose deprivation in Nrf2-/- cells (Fig. 4A). A similar trend was noted for GSSG levels in Nrf2-/- cells (data not shown). In contrast, glucose deprivation resulted in a transient increase in glutathione levels in wild-type cells (Fig. 4A, black bars). These results suggest that Nrf2 activation contributes to the maintenance of intracellular glutathione levels following ER stress. To confirm this finding, Nrf2-/- cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-Nrf2, and total glutathione levels were measured following glucose deprivation. The introduction of Nrf2 into the Nrf2-/- background restored cellular glutathione levels to levels comparable with those seen in wild-type cells (Fig. 4B, compare black and gray bars). Glutathione levels remained elevated in Nrf2-transfected cells even after 4 h of glucose deprivation (Fig. 4B), indicating that the loss of Nrf2 contributes to the decreased glutathione levels observed in Nrf2-/- cells. In addition, we were able to restore glutathione levels in Nrf2-/- cells via supplementation of the cell culture medium with cysteine (data not shown).

Professional phagocytes, such as microglia, contribute to the elimination of dead cells. Here we provide evidence that, in addition to their phagocytic activity, microglia promote the death of developing neurons engaged in synaptogenesis. In the developing mouse cerebellum, Purkinje cells die, and 60% of these neurons that already expressed activated caspase-3 were engulfed or contacted by spreading processes emitted by microglial cells. Apoptosis of Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices was strongly reduced by selective elimination of microglia. Superoxide ions produced by microglial respiratory bursts played a major role in this Purkinje cell death. Our study illustrates a mammalian form of engulfment-promoted cell death that links the execution of neuron death to the scavenging of dead cells."
https://openalex.org/W2155235678,"The Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis in human diseases and cancers. Though known to block apoptosis, Bcl-2 promotes cell death through an undefined mechanism. Here, we show that Bcl-2 interacts with orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 (also known as TR3), which is required for cancer cell apoptosis induced by many antineoplastic agents. The interaction is mediated by the N-terminal loop region of Bcl-2 and is required for Nur77 mitochondrial localization and apoptosis. Nur77 binding induces a Bcl-2 conformational change that exposes its BH3 domain, resulting in conversion of Bcl-2 from a protector to a killer. These findings establish the coupling of Nur77 nuclear receptor with the Bcl-2 apoptotic machinery and demonstrate that Bcl-2 can manifest opposing phenotypes, induced by interactions with proteins such as Nur77, suggesting novel strategies for regulating apoptosis in cancer and other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2096958727,"The mechanisms that control the precisely regulated switch from gene repression to gene activation represent a central question in mammalian development. Here, we report that transcriptional activation mediated by liganded nuclear receptors unexpectedly requires the actions of two highly related F box/WD-40-containing factors, TBL1 and TBLR1, initially identified as components of an N-CoR corepressor complex. TBL1/TBLR1 serve as specific adaptors for the recruitment of the ubiquitin conjugating/19S proteasome complex, with TBLR1 selectively serving to mediate a required exchange of the nuclear receptor corepressors, N-CoR and SMRT, for coactivators upon ligand binding. Tbl1 gene deletion in embryonic stem cells severely impairs PPARgamma-induced adipogenic differentiation, indicating that TBL1 function is also biologically indispensable for specific nuclear receptor-mediated gene activation events. The role of TBLR1 and TBL1 in cofactor exchange appears to also operate for c-Jun and NFkappaB and is therefore likely to be prototypic of similar mechanisms for other signal-dependent transcription factors."

We have therefore used a range of complementary spectroscopies to characterize the coordination of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to Aβ in solution. The mode of copper binding is highly pH-dependent. EPR spectroscopy indicates that both coppers have axial, Type II coordination geometry, square-planar or square-pyramidal, with nitrogen and oxygen ligands.

During fMRI, subjects made gender judgments on faces of people who had been introduced as fair (cooperators) or unfair (defector) players through repeated play of a sequential Prisoner's Dilemma game. To manipulate moral responsibility, players were introduced as either intentional or nonintentional agents. Our behavioral (likebility ratings and memory performance) as well as our imaging data confirm the saliency of social fairness for human interactions. Relative to neutral faces, faces of intentional cooperators engendered increased activity in left amygdala, bilateral insula, fusiform gyrus, STS, and reward-related areas. Our data indicate that rapid learning regarding the moral status of others is expressed in altered neural activity within a system associated with social cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2126440176,"To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying psychostimulant-elicited plasticity in the brain reward system, we undertook a phenotype-driven approach using genome-wide microarray profiling of striatal transcripts from three genetic and one pharmacological mouse models of psychostimulant or dopamine supersensitivity. A small set of co-affected genes was identified. One of these genes encoding the synaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 is downregulated in the striatum of all three mutants and in chronically, but not acutely, cocaine-treated mice. At the synaptic level, enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) of the frontocortico-accumbal glutamatergic synapses correlates with PSD-95 reduction in every case. Finally, targeted deletion of PSD-95 in an independent line of mice enhances LTP, augments the acute locomotor-stimulating effects of cocaine, but leads to no further behavioral plasticity in response to chronic cocaine. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of PSD-95 in psychostimulant action and identify a molecular and cellular mechanism shared between drug-related plasticity and learning."

However, the purpose of these cell cycle-associated events in neuronal apoptosis remains unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that cell cycle activation is a critical component of the DNA damage response in postmitotic neurons. Different genotoxic compounds (etoposide, methotrexate, and homocysteine) induced apoptosis accompanied by cell cycle reentry of terminally differentiated cortical neurons. In contrast, apoptosis initiated by stimuli that do not target DNA (staurosporine and colchicine) did not initiate cell cycle activation. Suppression of the function of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a proximal component of DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint pathways, attenuated both apoptosis and cell cycle reentry triggered by DNA damage but did not change the fate of neurons exposed to staurosporine and colchicine. Our data suggest that cell cycle activation is a critical element of the DNA damage response of postmitotic neurons leading to apoptosis."

We found that infection by RVFV leads to a rapid and drastic suppression of host cellular RNA synthesis that parallels a decrease of the TFIIH transcription factor cellular concentration. Using yeast two hybrid system, recombinant technology, and confocal microscopy, we further demonstrated that the nonstructural viral NSs protein interacts with the p44 component of TFIIH to form nuclear filamentous structures that also contain XPB subunit of TFIIH. By competing with XPD, the natural partner of p44 within TFIIH, and sequestering p44 and XPB subunits, NSs prevents the assembly of TFIIH subunits, thus destabilizing the normal host cell life. These observations shed light on the mechanism utilized by RVFV to evade the host response."
https://openalex.org/W2092102192,"Activated protein C (APC), a serine protease with anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory activities, exerts direct cytoprotective effects on endothelium via endothelial protein C receptor-dependent activation of protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1). Here, we report that APC protects mouse cortical neurons from two divergent inducers of apoptosis, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and staurosporine. APC blocked several steps in NMDA-induced apoptosis downstream to nitric oxide, i.e., caspase-3 activation, nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and induction of p53, and prevented staurosporine-induced apoptosis by blocking caspase-8 activation upstream of caspase-3 activation and AIF nuclear translocation. Intracerebral APC infusion dose dependently reduced NMDA excitotoxicity in mice. By using different anti-PARs antibodies and mice with single PAR1, PAR3, or PAR4 deletion, we demonstrated that direct neuronal protective effects of APC in vitro and in vivo require PAR1 and PAR3. Thus, PAR1 and PAR3 mediate anti-apoptotic signaling by APC in neurons, which may suggest novel treatments for neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1980053286,"SNAP-25 is a component of the SNARE complex implicated in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In this study, we demonstrate that hippocampal GABAergic synapses, both in culture and in brain, lack SNAP-25 and are resistant to the action of botulinum toxins type A and E, which cleave this SNARE protein. Relative to glutamatergic neurons, which express SNAP-25, GABAergic cells were characterized by a higher calcium responsiveness to depolarization. Exogenous expression of SNAP-25 in GABAergic interneurons lowered calcium responsiveness, and SNAP-25 silencing in glutamatergic neurons increased calcium elevations evoked by depolarization. Expression of SNAP-25(1-197) but not of SNAP-25(1-180) inhibited calcium responsiveness, pointing to the involvement of the 180-197 residues in the observed function. These data indicate that SNAP-25 is crucial for the regulation of intracellular calcium dynamics and, possibly, of network excitability. SNAP-25 is therefore a multifunctional protein that participates in exocytotic function both at the mechanistic and at the regulatory level."
https://openalex.org/W2132608478,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) degrades heme into iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide (CO). HO-1 expression can be used therapeutically to ameliorate undesirable consequences of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), but the mechanism by which this occurs, remains to be established. Rat hearts, exposed to a prolonged period (24 h) of cold (4 degrees C) ischemia, failed to function upon transplantation into syngeneic recipients. Induction of HO-1 expression by administration of cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) to the graft donor restored graft function. Inhibition of HO-1 enzymatic activity, by administration of zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPPIX) at the time of transplantation, reversed the protective effect of HO-1. Exposure of the graft donor as well as the graft (during ischemia) to exogenous CO mimicked the protective effect of HO-1. This was associated with a significant reduction in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis in the graft with no apparent decrease of intravascular fibrin polymerization, platelet aggregation, or P-selectin expression. In conclusion, HO-1-derived CO prevents IRI associated with cardiac transplantation based on its antiapoptotic action. The observation that exposure of the donor and the graft to CO is sufficient to afford this protective effect should have important clinical implications in terms of preventing IRI associated with heart transplantation in humans."

A brief course of treatment with biliverdin leads to long-term survival of H-2 incompatible heart allografts. Furthermore, those recipients harboring long-surviving (>100 days) allografts were tolerant to donor antigens indicated by the acceptance of second donor strain hearts but not third-party grafts. Treatment with biliverdin decreased intragraft leukocyte infiltration and inhibited T cell proliferation. Likely related to tolerance induction, biliverdin interferes with T cell signaling by inhibiting activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), two transcription factors involved in interleukin-2 (IL-2) transcription and T cell proliferation, as well as suppressing Th1 interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in vitro. These findings support the potential use of biliverdin, a natural product, in transplantation and other T cell mediated immune disorders."

The precursor of the GIP-forming β-barrel protein Tom40 is imported and assembled into the TOM complex by means of a multi-step pathway. The Tom40 precursor is recognized by Tom receptors (22Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Google Scholar, 41Keil P. Weinzierl A. Kiebler M. Dietmeier K. Söllner T. Pfanner N. J. Biol.

Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Google Scholar). Subsequently, the precursor of Tom40 leaves the TOM complex and undergoes two maturation steps, termed assembly intermediate I and assembly intermediate II. The intermediates can be monitored by blue native electrophoresis of lysed mitochondria as 250- and 100-kDa complexes, respectively (22Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Google Scholar). The assembly intermediate I is formed by the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) (46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Google Scholar, 47Mihara K. Nature. 2003; 424: 505-506Google Scholar). The SAM complex contains the subunits Mas37 and Sam50 (Tob55/Omp85) (46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C.

Beech P. Waller R. Lithgow T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 19-24Google Scholar). Subsequently, Tom40 stably associates with Tom5, forming the assembly intermediate II (46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Google Scholar). Then Tom6, Tom7, Tom22, and finally Tom20 associate to form the mature TOM complex (21Meisinger C. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Model K. Lim J.H. Sickmann A. Müller H. Meyer H.E. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Mol.

Here we report a surprising connection between two mitochondrial protein biogenesis pathways that have been assumed to represent separate entities so far, the SAM assembly pathway for Tom40 and the system of small Tim proteins that transfer the precursors of hydrophobic inner membrane proteins across the intermembrane space. The results presented here suggest that the intermembrane space is involved in the insertion of Tom40 into the outer membrane. Yeast Strains, Media, Mitochondrial Isolation, and Swelling—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are the wild-type strain YPH499 (51Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) and the corresponding mutant strains tim8Δ tim13Δ (PRY34) and tim10–2 (GB102) (33Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Rehling P. Müller H. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Guiard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7780-7789Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown on YPG medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 3% (v/v) glycerol) at 24 °C or 30 °C. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (52Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Google Scholar, 53Hartl F.U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Google Scholar), and aliquots were stored at –80 °C in SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2). For swelling of mitochondria, the pelleted mitochondria were resuspended in 1 vol of SEM buffer, and the suspension was diluted with 9 vol of swelling buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Import of Preproteins—Radiolabeled precursor proteins were obtained by in vitro transcription from pGEM-4Z (or genomic PCR products containing an SP6 Promotor) using SP6 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) (54Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Google Scholar). In vitro translation was performed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences). Import assays were carried out with 25–50 μg of mitochondria (protein amount) in 100–200 μl of import buffer (3% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 2–5 mm ATP, and, in the case of matrix precursor proteins, 2 mm NADH) with 2.5–10% (v/v) reticulocyte lysate. Import of precursor proteins was performed at 25 °C, except for the precursor of Tom20, where 10 °C was used (at 25 °C, import and assembly of Tom20 are too fast to be resolved in a kinetic manner). Where indicated, mitochondria were treated with 20–50 μg/ml proteinase K or 20 μg/ml trypsin for 15 min on ice. The proteases were inactivated by the addition of 1% (v/v) 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ethanol or 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, respectively. After a 5-min incubation on ice, the mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation and washed with SEM buffer. Mitochondrial proteins were separated by glycine-SDS-PAGE, Tris-Tricine-SDS-PAGE, or blue native PAGE (17Dekker P.J.T. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Müller H. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6515-6524Google Scholar, 55Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Google Scholar). Miscellaneous—For affinity purification of anti-Tim9 antibodies, S. cerevisiae Tim9 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21-Codon plus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) from the plasmid pET10N to produce an N-terminal His10-tagged protein. Cultures were grown at 37 °C for 4 h after induction of expression with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Tim9 was purified from isolated inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography essentially as described for Tim23 (56Truscott K.N. Kovermann P. Geissler A. Merlin A. Meijer M. Driessen A.J. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Wagner R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1074-1082Google Scholar), then dialysed against coupling buffer (30 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 2.5% (w/v) SDS) overnight at room temperature. Tim9 was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), as described by the manufacturer. To purify anti-Tim9 antibodies raised against an N-terminal region (peptide ALNSKEQQEFQKVVE), serum was diluted 1:1 with 1× TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl) then poured over the Tim9-Sepharose column. The column was washed extensively with 1× TBS prior to elution of specific antibodies with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. Samples were immediately neutralized with Tris buffer. Standard protocols were used for Western blotting and detection of immune complexes by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Non-relevant gel lanes were excised digitally. Radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by digital autoradiography using the PhosphorImage technology (Amersham Biosciences). Opening of the Mitochondrial Intermembrane Space Blocks the Biogenesis Pathway of Tom40 but not that of Tom20 —The precursor of yeast Tom40 was synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine. The precursor was incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria, and the assembly complexes were monitored by lysis of the mitochondria with digitonin and separated by blue native electrophoresis. In a time-dependent manner, the assembly intermediate I was formed, followed by the assembly intermediate II and the mature TOM complex, as described (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3; Refs. 22Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Google Scholar, 46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Google Scholar, 48Kozjak V. Wiedemann N. Milenkovic D. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48520-48523Google Scholar). To address a possible role of the intermembrane space in the biogenesis of Tom40, isolated mitochondria were subjected to swelling under conditions that led to an opening of the intermembrane space, whereas the inner membrane and matrix remained intact (22Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Google Scholar, 57Geissler A. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Brandner K. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Cell. 2002; 111: 507-518Google Scholar). The swollen mitochondria (mitoplasts) were then incubated with the radiolabeled precursor of Tom40. The assembly pathway of Tom40 was dramatically affected by swelling because the formation of the assembly intermediate I was already blocked (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6). Under these swelling conditions, neither the mature TOM complex nor the SAM complex were disturbed (22Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Google Scholar, 46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Google Scholar). The ruptured outer membrane remained attached to the mitoplasts, as shown by a Western blot analysis of endogenous Tom40 and Tom22, in comparison to Tim22 of the inner membrane (Fig. 1B). To analyze directly the intactness of the TOM complex, we imported the precursor of Tom20 that associates with the mature TOM complex. The assembly of Tom20 was not affected by the swelling of mitochondria (Fig. 1C). As an additional control, we show that the import of the matrix-targeted precursor of F1-ATPase subunit β was even moderately enhanced in mitoplasts (Fig. 1D, lanes 5–7; Ref. 58Kübrich M. Rassow J. Voos W. Pfanner N. Hönlinger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16374-16381Google Scholar), compared with intact mitochondria (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–3). We conclude that opening of the intermembrane space blocks the assembly pathway of the Tom40 precursor, whereas other mitochondrial precusor proteins are still efficiently imported. Mutant Mitochondria of Small Tim Proteins Are Impaired in the Biogenesis Pathway of Tom40 —We used a yeast strain where both TIM8 and TIM13 were deleted (33Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Rehling P. Müller H. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Guiard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7780-7789Google Scholar, 59Frazier A.E. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7818-7828Google Scholar). The assembly of Tom40 still took place, however, but with a reduced efficiency. In particular, the assembly intermediate I was reduced (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8 versus lanes 2 and 3) and the formation of the mature TOM complex was delayed (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10 versus lanes 4 and 5). To exclude indirect effects of the tim8Δ tim13Δ mitochondria, we analyzed the steady-state levels of various marker proteins. Except for the lack of the Tim8-Tim13 complex, all other proteins studied were present in roughly wild-type amounts, including the receptors Tom22, Tim9, and Tim23 of the inner membrane, and the matrix heat shock protein 70 (Fig. 2B). Blue native electrophoresis showed that the pre-existing TOM complex as well as the SAM complex were intact in tim8Δ tim13Δ mitochondria (Fig. 2C). Radiolabeled Tom20 assembled into the TOM complex of tim8Δ tim13Δ mitochondria with an efficiency close to that of wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 2D). Thus the delayed assembly of Tom40 cannot be attributed to a lack of TOM complex or SAM complex, supporting the conclusion that it was specifically due to the lack of the Tim8-Tim13 complex. Yeast cells lacking Tim8-Tim13 are viable (29Koehler C.M. Leuenberger D. Merchant S. Renold A. Junne T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2141-2146Google Scholar, 36Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Káldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Google Scholar). As Tom40 is essential for cell viability (60Baker K.P. Schaniel A. Vestweber D. Schatz G. Nature. 1990; 348: 605-609Google Scholar), the Tim8-Tim13 complex can only play a supportive (accelerating) role in the assembly pathway of Tom40. Because the Tim9-Tim10 complex is essential for viability of yeast (25Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Google Scholar, 26Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Fölsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Google Scholar, 27Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Oppliger W.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 313-319Google Scholar), we asked if this complex may also be required for the biogenesis of Tom40. We used the yeast mutant tim10–2 that carries point mutations in the TIM10 gene, causing a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype (33Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Rehling P. Müller H. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Guiard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7780-7789Google Scholar, 59Frazier A.E. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7818-7828Google Scholar). When the cells were grown at the permissive temperature of 24 °C, the isolated mitochondria contained wild-type amounts of the marker proteins analyzed, including Tom22, Tim13, Tim23, and matrix heat shock protein 70. Only the amount of Tim9 was reduced by about half (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the TOM complex as well as the SAM complex were present in wild-type amounts under steady-state conditions (Fig. 3B). tim10–2 mitochondria are selectively impaired in the function of the Tim9-Tim10 complex (33Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Rehling P. Müller H. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Guiard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7780-7789Google Scholar, 59Frazier A.E. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7818-7828Google Scholar). We imported the 35S-labeled precursor of Tom40 into isolated tim10–2 mitochondria. The Tom40 assembly pathway was significantly impaired at the level of the assembly intermediate I (Fig. 3C, lanes 6 and 7 versus lanes 1 and 2). To control for the specificity of the assembly defect, we used the precursor of Tom20 and found an efficient assembly reaction into the TOM complex (Fig. 3D). We conclude that both complexes of small Tim proteins of the intermembrane space, the essential Tim9-Tim10 complex and the non-essential Tim8-Tim13 complex, are involved in the assembly pathway of Tom40. In mutant mitochondria of each complex, the formation of the assembly intermediate I complex is partially inhibited. The TIM Complexes of the Intermembrane Space Are Involved in an Early Stage of the Assembly Pathway of Tom40 — Characterization of the role of small Tim proteins in the import pathway of hydrophobic inner membrane proteins indicated that these intermembrane space complexes were involved in an efficient translocation of the precursor proteins through the TOM complex to the intermembrane space (25Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Google Scholar, 26Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Fölsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Google Scholar). Tom40 inserted into the outer membrane is largely protected against externally added trypsin except for a small fragment that can be cleaved off by the protease from about half of the Tom40 molecules (16Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Google Scholar, 46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Google Scholar). When the Tom40 precursor has reached the SAM complex, i.e. assembly intermediate I, it already shows this characteristic protease protection (22Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Google Scholar, 46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Google Scholar). We used this trypsin assay to study if defects in the small Tim proteins affected an early stage of Tom40 biogenesis before formation of the assembly intermediate I. The formation of trypsin-protected Tom40 and the characteristic Tom40 fragment were indeed delayed in both tim8Δ tim13Δ mitochondria and tim10–2 mitochondria (Fig. 4, A and B). Under the same import conditions, the import and protease-protection of the matrix-targeted model preprotein Su9-DHFR, consisting of the presequence of F0-ATPase subunit 9 and the passenger dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (61Pfanner N. Tropschug M. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 49: 815-823Google Scholar), were not impaired (Fig. 4, C and D). We conclude that the transfer of Tom40 precursor to a protease-protected location is delayed when small Tim proteins of the intermembrane space are impaired, indicating that small Tim proteins are involved in the assembly pathway of Tom40 before the assembly intermediate I. We asked if intermembrane space components were also required for later stages of the Tom40 assembly pathway. To selectively deplete intermembrane space components, we used the swelling assay shown in Fig. 1 at distinct import stages. Swelling led to a release of the bulk of the Tim9-Tim10 and Tim8-Tim13 complexes, as shown by Western blot analysis for Tim9 and Tim13 (Fig. 5A, lane 4), whereas proteins of the outer membrane (Tom40), inner membrane (Tim22), and matrix (citrate synthase and the cochaperone Mge1) remained completely in the mitoplast fraction (Fig. 5A, lane 3). The 35S-labeled precursor of Tom40 was accumulated at different intermediate stages and then chased to the next step of the assembly pathway (Fig. 5B; Ref. 46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Google Scholar). Although the formation of assembly intermediate I was blocked when the mitochondria were swollen before the import reaction (Fig. 1A; Fig. 5C, lane 2), the subsequent steps were not inhibited by a swelling of mitochondria. When Tom40 precursor was first accumulated at the intermediate stage I (Fig. 5C, lane 3) and the mitochondria were then subjected to swelling, the chase to intermediate II still occurred with good efficiency (Fig. 5C, lane 5). Similarly, Tom40 accumulated at intermediate stage II (Fig. 5C, lane 6) was chased into the mature TOM complex with comparable yield in non-swollen and swollen mitochondria (Fig. 5C, lanes 7 and 8). These results indicate that a depletion of the intermembrane space selectively blocks an early stage of Tom40 assembly required for formation of the assembly intermediate I. We report that the mitochondrial intermembrane space is involved in the biogenesis pathway of the central component of the TOM complex, the protein import channel Tom40. Depletion of the intermembrane space selectively blocks the assembly pathway of Tom40 at an early stage that is required to form the assembly intermediate I (Fig. 6). Once the assembly intermediate I has been formed, i.e. the Tom40 precursor is accumulated at the SAM complex, the subsequent assembly steps are not affected by a depletion of intermembrane space components, including formation of the assembly intermediate II and the association of small Tom proteins as well as Tom receptors with Tom40 (22Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Google Scholar, 46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Google Scholar). These findings have important implications for the sorting pathway of the Tom40 precursor. The Tom40 precursor accumulated at the SAM complex has been shown to be largely protected against protease added to the outside of the mitochondria, but accessible to protease upon opening of the intermembrane space by swelling (22Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Google Scholar). Moreover, the recently identified essential subunit of the SAM complex, Sam50, contains a β-barrel domain conserved from bacteria to man (48Kozjak V. Wiedemann N. Milenkovic D. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48520-48523Google Scholar, 49Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Google Scholar, 50Gentle I. Gabriel K. Beech P. Waller R. Lithgow T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 19-24Google Scholar). The bacterial homolog Omp85 is possibly involved in protein export to the bacterial outer membrane (62Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Google Scholar). Based on these observations it had been suggested that the precursor of Tom40, after passing through the TOM complex, may follow a conserved SAM-pathway of insertion into the outer membrane from the intermembrane space side (22Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Google Scholar, 46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T.

Biol. 2001; 8: 284-286Google Scholar). However, experimental evidence for an involvement of the intermembrane space in the assembly pathway has been lacking so far. The findings reported here indeed demonstrate that the intermembrane space plays a critical role in the assembly pathway of Tom40. The role of intermembrane space components is specific and cannot be explained by a general effect on the stability of the TOM complex because the assembly of the precursor of Tom20 into the TOM complex is not affected by depletion of intermembrane space components. We found that at least two protein complexes of the intermembrane space are involved in the assembly pathway of Tom40. Partial inactivation of the essential Tim9-Tim10 complex as well as deletion of the related, but non-essential Tim8-Tim13 complex already delayed the biogenesis pathway of Tom40 at the level of assembly intermediate I formation. The Tim9-Tim10 complex has been known so far for its role in the import of hydrophobic inner membrane carrier proteins, whereas the Tim8-Tim13 complex has been found to show a preference for the precursor of Tim23 (34Leuenberger D. Bally N.A. Schatz G. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4816-4822Google Scholar, 35Davis A.J. Sepuri N.B. Holder J. Johnson A.E. Jensen R.E. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1017-1027Google Scholar). These soluble TIM complexes interact with hydrophobic segments and some additional regions of the inner membrane precursor proteins and are assumed to possess chaperone-like properties in guiding the hydrophobic precursors through the aqueous intermembrane space (32Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Google Scholar, 35Davis A.J. Sepuri N.B. Holder J. Johnson A.E. Jensen R.E. J.

It is thus conceivable that the complexes of these small Tim proteins assist in guiding hydrophobic segments of Tom40 exposed to the intermembrane space. Apparently, the two soluble TIM complexes can in part substitute for each other in the biogenesis pathway of Tom40, explaining why the Tom40 assembly pathway is only delayed, but not blocked when either complex is inactivated in yeast mutants. Thus the steady-state level of the TOM complex remains at a wild-type level in these mutants, excluding the concern that the observed defects in Tom40 assembly would simply be caused by a defective pre-existing TOM complex. During the import of carrier proteins and Tim23, the soluble TIM complexes promote the transfer of the precursor proteins through the TOM complex (25Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Google Scholar, 26Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Fölsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Google Scholar, 28Adam A. Endres M.

Similarly, we found that these TIM complexes are required for an efficient translocation of the Tom40 precursor to a protease-protected location. As recognition and translocation by the TOM complex represents the initial stage of the Tom40 import pathway (22Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat.

Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Google Scholar), we propose that the small Tim proteins and possibly further intermembrane space components are involved in the efficient transfer of the Tom40 precursor through the TOM complex to the intermembrane space side and its transfer to the SAM complex (Fig. 6). Tom40 is a β-barrel protein like the most abundant outer membrane protein porin (VDAC) (65Mannella C.A. Neuwald A.F. Lawrence C.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 163-169Google Scholar, 66Blachly-Dyson E. Song J. Wolfgang W.J. Colombini M. Forte M. Mol. Cell.

J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1361-1373Google Scholar). The currently available evidence supports the view that the sorting and assembly pathway established for Tom40 may serve as a paradigm for the biogenesis pathways of other β-barrel proteins. The precursor of porin requires the TOM complex for the initial stages of its assembly pathway (68Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Google Scholar) and rupturing of the outer membrane impairs its assembly (data not shown) (69Smith M. Hicks S. Baker K. McCauley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28460-28464Google Scholar). For both porin and Mdm10 it has been shown that the SAM complex containing the highly conserved Sam50 is required for their biogenesis pathway as for Tom40 (46Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A.

https://openalex.org/W1523751054,"Leptin, a peptide encoded by the obese (ob) gene, is primarily secreted by adipocytes and is a critical hormone that controls body weight due to its central effects. Recently, additional roles for leptin in the gastrointestinal tract have been suggested because gastric lining cells also produce and release leptin in response to meal-related stimuli. While gastric epithelia might thus directly contribute to circulating leptin following a meal, here we show that inflamed colonic epithelial cells express and release leptin apically into the intestinal lumen. In addition, we demonstrate leptin expression and secretion in vitro in epithelial cells. In response to luminal leptin, model intestinal epithelia critically activate the NF-kappaB, a key signaling system to pro-inflammatory stimuli. The inflammatory effect of luminal leptin was characterized in vivo in mice administered intrarectal leptin. Leptin induced epithelial wall damage and neutrophil infiltration that represent characteristic histological findings in acute intestinal inflammation. These observations provide evidence for an intraluminal biological signaling of leptin and a new pathophysiological role for intraluminal leptin during states of intestinal inflammation such as inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2042252387,"We describe the isolation and characterization of nwk (nervous wreck), a temperature-sensitive paralytic mutant that causes excessive growth of larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), resulting in increased synaptic bouton number and branch formation. Ultrastructurally, mutant boutons have reduced size and fewer active zones, associated with a reduction in synaptic transmission. nwk encodes an FCH and SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein that localizes to the periactive zone of presynaptic terminals and binds to the Drosophila ortholog of Wasp (Wsp), a key regulator of actin polymerization. wsp null mutants display synaptic overgrowth similar to nwk and enhance the nwk morphological phenotype in a dose-dependent manner. Evolutionarily, Nwk belongs to a previously undescribed family of adaptor proteins that includes the human srGAPs, which regulate Rho activity downstream of Robo receptors. We propose that Nwk controls synapse morphology by regulating actin dynamics downstream of growth signals in presynaptic terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2163492988,"Corticothalamic (CT) projections are approximately 10 times more numerous than thalamocortical projections, yet their function in sensory processing is poorly understood. In particular, the functional significance of the topographic precision of CT feedback is unknown. We addressed these issues in the rodent somatosensory whisker/barrel system by deflecting individual whiskers and pharmacologically enhancing activity in layer VI of single whisker-related cortical columns. Enhancement of corticothalamic activity in a cortical column facilitated whisker-evoked responses in topographically aligned thalamic barreloid neurons, while activation of an adjacent column weakly suppressed activity at the same thalamic site. Both effects were more pronounced when stimulating the preferred, or principal, whisker than for adjacent whiskers. Thus, facilitation by homologous CT feedback sharpens thalamic receptive field focus, while suppression by nonhomologous feedback diminishes it. Our findings demonstrate that somatosensory cortex can selectively regulate thalamic spatial response tuning by engaging topographically specific excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms in the thalamus."
https://openalex.org/W1975478809,"The orphan nuclear estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) and transcriptional cofactor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) are involved in the regulation of energy metabolism. Recently, extensive cross-talk between PGC-1α and ERRα has been demonstrated. The presence of PGC-1α is associated with an elevated expression of ERRα, and the two proteins can influence the transcriptional activities of one another. Using a candidate gene approach to detect regulatory variants within genes encoding nuclear receptors, we have identified a 23-bp sequence (ESRRA23) containing two nuclear receptor recognition half-site motifs that is present in 1–4 copies within the promoter of the human ESRRA gene encoding ERRα. The ESRRA23 sequence contains a functional ERR response element that is specifically bound by ERRα, and chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that endogenous ERRα occupies its own promoter in vivo. Strikingly, introduction of PGC-1α in HeLa cells by transient transfection induces the activity of the ESRRA promoter in a manner that is dependent on the presence of the ESRRA23 element and on its dosage. Coexpression of ERRα and PGC-1α results in a synergistic activation of the ESRRA promoter. In experiments using ERRα null fibroblasts, the ability of PGC-1α to stimulate the ESRRA promoter is considerably reduced but can be restored by addition of ERRα. Taken together, these results demonstrate that an interdependent ERRα/PGC-1α-based transcriptional pathway targets the ESRRA23 element to dictate the level of ERRα expression.

Nuclear hormone receptors are transcription factors that control essential developmental and physiological pathways (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar). Although the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors is primarily regulated by specific ligands, several members of the superfamily of nuclear receptors have no known natural ligands and are therefore referred to as orphan receptors (2Giguère V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Google Scholar). Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα 1The abbreviations used are: ERRα, estrogen-related receptor α; ERα, estrogen receptor α; ERE, estrogen response element; ERRE, estrogen-related receptor response element; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; TK, thymidine kinase. ; NR3B1) was the first orphan nuclear receptor to be identified on the basis of its similarity with estrogen receptor α (ERα; NR3A1) (3Giguère V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Google Scholar). Phylogenic tree reconstruction confirmed that ERRα belongs to the sub-group of receptors for steroid hormones (4Laudet V. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 207-226Google Scholar), and ERRα was subsequently shown to share both structural and functional attributes with the ERs including binding to synthetic estrogenic ligands (reviewed in Ref. 5Giguère V. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 220-225Google Scholar). ERRα also recognizes estrogen response elements (EREs), but characterization of its DNA binding properties demonstrated a preference for sites composed of a single half-site preceded by three nucleotides with the consensus sequence TNAAGGTCA, referred to as an ERRE (6Wiley S.R.

Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of ERRα is independent of exogenously added ligand, and its relative potency as a transcriptional activator appears to be cell context- and promoter-dependent (3Giguère V.

ERRα has also been described as a potent repressor of the SV40 late promoter (6Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Zuo F. Murray E.E. Loritz K. Mertz J.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2206-2219Google Scholar) and to interfere with the functions of glucocorticoid, retinoic acid, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (8Sladek R. Bader J.-A. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Google Scholar, 16Trapp T. Holsboer F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9879-9882Google Scholar, 17Maehara K. Hida T. Abe Y. Koga A. Ota K. Kutoh E. J. Mol.

Although the exact physiological role of ERRα has not been defined precisely, increasing evidence suggest that ERRα plays an important role in regulating cellular energy balance. ERRα is predominantly expressed in tissues demonstrating a high capacity for fatty acid β-oxidation (3Giguère V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Google Scholar, 8Sladek R.

More recently, ERRα null mice have been shown to display reduced body weight and peripheral fat deposition and be resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity (19Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.-A. Richard D. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Google Scholar). In agreement with the observed phenotype, gene microarray experiments demonstrated alteration in the expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and energy metabolism, including cytochrome c, medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase 2, and fatty-acid synthase (19Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.-A. Richard D. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors is dependent on specific interactions with coregulatory proteins (20McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar). The recent identification and functional characterization of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), PGC-1β, and PGC-1-related protein revealed the existence of a family of coactivators that possess the unique characteristic of relaying diverse physiological signals to transcription factors that regulate gene networks controlling energy balance (reviewed in Refs. 21Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Google Scholar and 22Knutti D. Kralli A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Google Scholar). In particular, PGC-1α has been shown to regulate thermogenesis in brown fat (23Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar), mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration in skeletal muscle (24Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N.

Nature. 2003; 423: 550-555Google Scholar). PGC-1β may also contribute to the control of energy metabolism as overexpression of this gene in transgenic mice induces a high energy expenditure and antagonizes obesity (28Kamei Y. Ohizumi H. Fujitani Y. Nemoto T. Tanaka T. Takahashi N. Kawada T. Miyoshi M. Ezaki O. Kakizuka A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12378-12383Google Scholar). Although PGC-1α was originally identified as a transcriptional coactivator specific for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (23Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar), subsequent studies have demonstrated that PGC-1α influences the activity of numerous transcription factors, including a wide array of nuclear receptors (22Knutti D. Kralli A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Google Scholar). Recently, two groups, using similar yeast two-hybrid approaches, independently identified ERRα as a novel PGC-1α-binding protein (18Ichida M. Nemoto S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50991-50995Google Scholar, 29Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Google Scholar). Huss et al. (29Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Google Scholar) demonstrated that PGC-1α enhances ERRα transcriptional activity on the medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase promoter. In contrast, Ichida et al. (18Ichida M. Nemoto S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50991-50995Google Scholar) described ERRα as a repressor of PGC-1α activity on the PEPCK promoter. ERRα transcriptional activity has also been shown to be stimulated by PGC-1α and -1β in transient transfection assays using synthetic promoters (30Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Google Scholar). Interestingly, ERRα and PGC-1α show similar expression profiles in adult tissues, including induction of expression of both genes by exposure to cold (18Ichida M. Nemoto S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50991-50995Google Scholar, 30Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, PGC-1α has been shown to induce the expression of ERRα (30Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain to be elucidated. In this study, we first used a candidate gene approach to detect variants within genes encoding nuclear hormone receptors likely to play a role in physiology and be associated with disease. We first performed a family-wide screen of the genes encoding nuclear receptors in French Canadian women for novel frequent variants. This screen included exons, splice consensus sites, and ∼1 kb of sequence located upstream of the first exon presumably containing promoter regulatory sequences. This led us to identify a 23-bp sequence referred to as ESRRA23, located at position -682 in the ESRRA gene promoter that can be found in 1–4 copies in human chromosomes. Remarkably, this sequence includes a functional ERRE that is also responsive to the presence of PGC-1α. In this report, we describe the properties of this novel polymorphic regulatory element and functional consequences of its dosage in the ESRRA promoter responses to ERRα and PGC-1α. Our results demonstrate the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism by which ERRα can control its own expression and further suggest the existence of an interdependent PGC-1α/ERRα pathway involved in the control of energy balance. Identification of a Polymorphic Repeat in the ESRRA Promoter—The primers 5′-CCTTGGTGTGGCCTCGACTG-3′ and 5′-GCACTCGCGAGCCAAGAGA-3′ were used to produce a 1054-bp fragment upstream of ESRRA exon 1. PCR was performed according to standard protocols with Taq polymerase from Qiagen. PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and quantified by gel electrophoresis with standardized amounts of DNA. Automated sequencing of PCR products was performed with fluorescently labeled dideoxy terminators using the BigDye terminator cycle-sequencing kit on a ABI 377 DNA-Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Genotyping—Genomic DNA was purified from 200 μl of peripheral blood leukocytes with whole blood DNA purification kits for 96-well plates from Qiagen. The collected DNA was further diluted five times with a solution of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing a 56.3 μm concentration of an inert fluorescent dye, ROX (Molecular Probes, C-1309). The final concentration of ROX was 45 μm in each DNA sample, and the mean DNA concentration was 5 ng/μl. For each PCR, 5 μl of reaction mixture was used regardless of the DNA concentration. Genotyping for the ESRRA23 minisatellite in the ESRRA promoter was performed using the following primers; 5′-CGTGGCCCCGCCCTTCC-3′ and 5′-GTAGACCCAGTAGCCCCACAG-3′. PCR was performed in a 96-well microplate (Axygen) with 5 μl (25 ng) of genomic DNA and 20 μl of PCR premix containing 2.5 μl of 10× buffer (Qiagen), 200 μm concentration of each dNTP, 7.5 pmol of each primer, 1× Q-solution (Qiagen), 2% Me2SO, and 1 unit of HotStart Taq DNA polymerase. PCR setup in the microplates was performed with a Qiagen Biorobot 3000 or manually with a multichannel (8- or 12-channel) pipette. The plates were then covered with a silicone mat (Axymat from Axygen) and properly sealed using a roller (MJ Research). PCR was performed on a MJ PTC-200 (MJ Research), 95 °C for 15 min, 30 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 58 °C, 45 s at 72 °C, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel in TBE 1× buffer (0.089 m Tris, 0.089 m boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 10 V/cm. The reaction produces amplicons of 198 bp with two repeats, 221 bp with three repeats, 244 bp with four repeats, and 175 bp with only one repeat. The gels were photographed, and the genotype was assigned by two independent readers. 180 samples were run in duplicate with a concordance rate of 99%. Cloning of the ESRRA Promoter—Genomic DNA from blood samples or lymphoblastoid cell lines containing two or three repeats was prepared with the QIAamp kit (Qiagen) and used as the template in a PCR to amplify the promoter region of the human ESRRA gene. The primers used had the sequences 5′-GCGGTACCTGAGTGCCCTGCGCTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCAAGATTCCTACTCCGCTTCCTC-3′ (reverse) and produced a product of 1.2 kb. This fragment was digested with KpnI and HindIII and subcloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI). All of the selected clones were sequenced with fluorescently labeled dideoxy terminators using the BigDye terminator cycle-sequencing kit on a ABI 377 DNA-Sequencer. Plasmids and Cell Transfections—The ERRα cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pCMX. Plasmids expressing the ERRα-VP16 fusion protein were constructed by subcloning PCR-amplified ERRα cDNA into pCMX-VP16 downstream of the VP16 activation domain. The DNA binding null mutant ERRαDBDm was generated by substituting the glutamic acid and alanine residues of the ERRα P box for glycine residues. ERRαDBDm does not bind DNA as examined by EMSA in vitro but locates to the nucleus when transfected in mammalian cells. 2Y. Kiriyama and V. Giguère, unpublished results. Expression vector for human ERα has been described (31Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Labrie F. Giguère V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 877-881Google Scholar). The pCDNA3.1 HA-hPGC-1α vector was described previously (32Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Google Scholar) and obtained from A. Kralli (La Jolla, CA). The luciferase reporter plasmid ESRRA23-TKLuc and ESRRA23 (3Giguère V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Google Scholar)-TKLuc contained 1 and 3 copies, respectively, of the ESRRA23 response element (see Fig. 1A) cloned into pTKLuc. A fragment containing ESRRA promoter sequence 1.2 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site was subcloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3 to give pGL3ESRRA. To construct the ΔESRRA promoter luciferase reporter gene, sequences 5′ and 3′ adjacent to the ESRRA23 elements and putative ERRα binding site were amplified by PCR and subcloned sequentially into pGL3. HeLa cells were obtained form American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from 13.5-day-old wild-type and ERRα null embryos (19Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.-A. Richard D. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Google Scholar). The embryos were minced with a razor blade, and the cells were dissociated by trypsin. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, cells were seeded in 12-well plates and grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. One-hundred ng of expression vector for nuclear receptors, 0.4 μg of expression vector for the PGC-1α expression vector, 0.4 μg of luciferase reporter, and 0.3 μg of CMX β-galactosidase plasmids were introduced into cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). When using LipofectAMINE, cells were maintained in the presence of liposomes for 16 h and cultured for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested in potassium phosphate buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Luciferase activity was determined using Steady-Glo (Promega), and values were read with the Victor 2 in the luminescence mode. The transfection was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity of each sample. All results represent experiments conducted in duplicate at least three times. Electromobility Shift Assay—ERRα and ERα proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). DNA binding reactions were conducted as described previously (33Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Google Scholar) using 5 μl of programmed lysates in each binding reaction. The entire reaction was loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 150 V at room temperature. The gel was dried and exposed overnight at -85 °C. The oligonucleotides and their complements that were used as probes and competitors are shown in Fig. 2A. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (34Laganière J. Deblois G. Giguère V. Russell D.W. Mangelsdorf D.J. Methods Enzymol.Vol. 364. Academic Press, San Diego2003: 339-350Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were cross-linked for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and centrifuged. Pellets were incubated in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) for 15 min and sonicated four times for 10 s using a VirSonic 100 (Virtis) sonicator. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm to remove the debris, soluble chromatin was diluted 10-fold in chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and immunoprecipitated using a specific anti-human ERRα polyclonal antibody developed in our laboratory against the non-conserved aminoterminal region of the protein. This antibody does not recognize ERRβ, ERRγ, ERα, or ERβ proteins. Following immunoprecipitation, 40 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate) was added and incubated for 2 h. The precipitates were washed sequentially for 10 min each with buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), with buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and with buffer III (0.25 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Precipitates were then washed three times with TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA) and eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer. The eluates were pooled and incubated at 65 °C for at least 6 h. The isolated DNA fragments were purified according to QIAquick Spin Kit. Real time quantitative PCR was performed using LightCycler and Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green1 (Roche) and the primers 5′-CCATCCGAGTGGAATTTGAGTCCTAAAG-3′ and 5′-GAACCGTAGACCCAGTAGCCCCACAGAG-3′ for the ESRRA promoter region containing the ESRRA23 elements. For the negative control region located 4 kb upstream of the initiation start site, the primers were 5′-GTGGCCCACAGGTGTCGCTCAAGTCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGATGCAGTGTCCTTCTCCCCCAGATTG-3′. Enrichment of the ESRRA promoter region was normalized against the upstream control region. PCR products were visualized after migration on a 2% agarose gel. Identification of a Polymorphic Hormone Response Element in the ESRRA Promoter—Our search for functional coding and regulatory polymorphisms in genes encoding members of the nuclear receptor superfamily led us to identify a 23-bp element (Fig. 1A) located at position -682 in the ESRRA promoter that is present in 1–4 copies in human chromosomes. Sequence analysis of the 23-bp element, herein referred to as ESRRA23, revealed the presence of two nuclear receptor half-site recognition motifs (Fig. 1A). The upstream half-site is preceded by the three nucleotides TGA thus generating a consensus ERRα binding site, also referred to as an ERRE (8Sladek R. Bader J.-A. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Google Scholar). An additional putative ERRE, TCAAGGTCA, can also be found in the promoter region 1 bp downstream of the ESRRA23 sequence (Fig. 1B). The ESRRA23 element and the few base pairs flanking it, including the putative ERRE downstream of the repeated element, are absolutely conserved between human and mouse genomic sequences (Fig. 1C). However, the ESRRA23 element is present in a single copy in the mouse genome. The observed ESRRA allelic frequencies among 5490 human chromosomes (2745 individuals) were “1” = 0.06, “2” = 93.15, “3” = 6.3 and “4” = 0.36 (Table I).Table IObserved ESRRA allelic frequencies among 5490 human chromosomesGenotype1,21,32,22,32,43,33,4No.2123813341683Percent0.0740.03786.7412.170.580.290.11 Open table in a new tab Functional Characterization of the Polymorphic ESRRA23 Element—Given the observation that the polymorphic sequence contained a putative ERRE, we first tested whether the ESRRA23 motif could serve as an autoregulatory element for ERRα. Electromobility shift assays using in vitro translated proteins and a set of oligonucleotide probes derived from the ESRRA23 element (Fig. 2A) showed that ERRα binds ESRRA23 with high specificity (Fig. 2B). Nucleotide changes within the upstream AGGTCA motif (ESRRA23m1) abolished ERRα binding, whereas similar mutations in the downstream CGGTCA half-site (ESRRA23m2) had little effect on recognition of the element by ERRα (Fig. 2B). The ERRβ and -γ isoforms also bound the ESRRA23 element with similar affinity (data not shown). It has been shown recently (35Liu D. Zhang Z. Gladwell W. Teng C.T. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4894-4904Google Scholar) that treatment with the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol can enhance the expression of ERRα. However, the related ERα did not significantly bind the ESRRA23 element or the downstream half-site in this assay, but it did recognize a control ERE (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Previous studies (8Sladek R. Bader J.-A. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Google Scholar, 10Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Google Scholar, 15Lu D. Kiriyama Y. Lee K.Y. Giguère V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6755-6761Google Scholar, 36Pettersson K. Svensson K. Mattsson R. Carlsson B. Ohlsson R. Berkenstam A. Mech. Dev. 1996; 54: 211-223Google Scholar) have shown that the ERRs can bind to their response element as either monomers or homodimers. The presence of an intermediate retarded complex in a binding experiment using a mixture of wild-type and amino-terminal truncated receptors clearly demonstrates that ERRα preferentially binds ESRRA23 as a homodimer (Fig. 2C, arrow). We next examined whether the ESRRA23 element could act as a functional ERRE in vivo when linked to a heterologous promoter. As expected, the generally transcriptionally silent ERRα failed to generate a significant response when assayed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2D). To test whether ERRα recognizes the ESRRA23 element in vivo, we used a mammalian one-hybrid system in which ERRα is linked to the potent transcriptional activation domain of the viral VP16 protein. Indeed, the constitutively active ERRα-VP16 chimera induced strong transcriptional responses (10–57-fold) in an element-dosage manner (Fig. 2E) demonstrating that ERRα can recognize the ESRRA23 element in vivo. We next studied the functional consequence of the ESRRA23 regulatory variant on the ESRRA promoter itself. Human ESRRA promoters containing either 2 or 3 copies of the ESRRA23 element representing the most commonly observed genotypes were cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3A). We also engineered a mutant ESRRA promoter construct in which all copies of the ESRRA23 element as well as the nonpolymorphic putative downstream ERRE were removed (Fig. 3A, ΔESRRA). ERRα induced a small but significant transcriptional response of 1.5- or 2-fold on the ESRRA promoter containing 2 or 3 copies of ESRRA23, respectively (Fig. 3B). The effect is specific as removal of the elements abolishes the ERRα-induced transcriptional response. As observed with the synthetic ESRRA23-thymidine kinase (TK) promoters, the ERRα-VP16 chimera elicited strong responses from the reporter gene driven by the ESRRA promoters containing either 2 or 3 copies of ESRRA23 being 7- and 14-fold, respectively (Fig. 3C). The mammalian one-hybrid assay thus confirms that ERRα can directly interact with the ESRRA promoter. The specificity of the transcriptional effect was demonstrated in that the strength of the response was directly related to the copy number of ESRRA23 and that ablation of the ESRRA23 completely abolished ERRα-VP16-induced luciferase activity. Lastly, we used a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to test whether endogenous ERRα interacts with the ESRRA promoter in the context of the native chromatin. The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was shown previously to express endogenous ERRα and therefore was used for this assay (15Lu D. Kiriyama Y. Lee K.Y. Giguère V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6755-6761Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, an antibody raised against human ERRα immunoprecipitates a DNA fragment that includes the ESRRA23 elements. Quantitative PCR showed a 25-fold enrichment of the promoter fragment over the control fragment located 4 kb upstream of the ESRRA23 element. Taken together, these experiments clearly show that ERRα recognizes its own promoter via the polymorphic ESRRA23 element. The ESRRA23 Element Dictates PGC-1α Control of ERRα Expression—As introduced above, recent studies (18Ichida M. Nemoto S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50991-50995Google Scholar, 29Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Google Scholar, 30Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Google Scholar) have shown that the coactivator PGC-1α can regulate both the expression and transcriptional activity of ERRα. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the action of PGC-1α on ERRα expression has not yet been elucidated. As shown in Fig. 4A, the introduction of PGC-1α alone by transient transfection in HeLa cells has a significant effect on ESRRA promoter activity, leading to a 4- and 6.5-fold induction in luciferase activity generated by the ESRRA promoter reporter constructs containing 2 and 3 copies of the ESRRA23 element, respectively. The increased ESRRA promoter activity induced by PGC-1α is not only ESRRA23 dosage-dependent but is mediated through ESRRA23 and possibly with a contribution by the flanking ERRE, given that deletion of the region encoding these elements from the ESRRA promoter resulted in a complete loss of the stimulatory activity (Fig. 4A). The direct involvement of the ESRRA23 element in the PGC-1α response was further demonstrated by the observation that PGC-1α can activate TK-luciferase reporter genes containing 3 copies of the ESRRA23 element but not the parent vector (Fig. 4B). The presence of a single copy of the ESRRA23 element was not sufficient to confer PGC-1α responsiveness to the TK promoter in HeLa cells. However, PGC-1α activity is much more potent in COS-1 cells on both the ESRRA and ESRRA23-TK promoters suggesting that cell context may be important for the PGC-1α response (data not shown). ERRα-dependent PGC-1α Activity—PGC-1α has been described recently (29Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Google Scholar, 30Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Google Scholar) as a potent coactivator of ERRα and the related ERRγ isoform. We therefore investigated the interaction between ERRα and PGC-lα on the polymorphic ESRRA promoter in HeLa cells. As observed in Fig. 5, coexpression of ERRα and PGC-lα in HeLa cells results in a synergistic activation of the ESRRA promoter. This set of experiments also demonstrates that both the independent and combined transcriptional activities of ERRα and PGC-1α are not observed in the absence of either the region containing the ESRRA23 elements or a functional ERRα DNA binding domain. The response to ERRα and PGC-lα is also element dosage-dependent, as the promoter containing 3 copies of the ESRRA23 element displays higher activity than the promoter containing 2 copies of the element in the presence of these regulatory factors (Fig. 5). We next tested whether the presence of ERRα was absolutely essential to the activity of PGC-1α on the ESRRA23 element. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from both wild-type and ERRα null mice (19Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.-A. Richard D. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Google Scholar) and transfected with PGC-1α and ERRα, alone or in combination with the ESRRA promoter reporter construct containing 3 copies of the ESRRA23 element. ERRα is not transcriptionally active in MEFs, but the constitutively active ERRα-VP16 chimera displays identical activity in MEFs derived from both strains, indicating that ERRα recognizes the ESRRA promoter in a similar manner in both cell types (Fig. 6). As observed previously in HeLa cells, the introduction of PGC-1α in wild-type MEFs leads to a significant (3-fold) induction of ESRRA promoter activity. However, PGC-1α transcriptional activity is considerably reduced in ERRα null MEFs, but this activity can be completely restored by the introduction of exogenous ERRα (Fig. 6). The response to PGC-1α was not observed when the ΔESRRA construct was used as a reporter in this assay (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate a central role for ERRα in PGC-1α-induced activation of the ESRRA promoter via the ESRRA23 element. In this report, we described the identification and functional characterization of a new polymorphic hormone response element (ESRRA23) present in the ESRRA gene promoter, the gene encoding the orphan nuclear receptor ERRα. Functional analysis of the polymorphic ESRRA23 sequence showed it to act as an autoregulatory element for ERRα in which activity is dependent on the presence of PGC-1α. Conversely, our results also demonstrate that PGC-1α activity on the ESRRA promoter is dependent on the presence of ERRα. Our study thus delineates the molecular mechanisms by which PGC-1α can up-regulate ERRα expression (30Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Google Scholar) and by which ERRα can control its own expression in a positive fashion. Our results also clearly establish a direct correlation between the number of ESRRA23 repeat elements present and the response of the ESRRA promoter to ERRα and PGC-lα proteins alone or in combination. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a natural regulatory polymorphism consisting of a sequence, present in one copy or in tandem-repeated elements two, three, or four times, containing a functional hormone response element for a nuclear receptor-coactivator complex. The expression patterns of ERRα and PGC-lα and their response to specific physiological stimuli such as cold and starvation are nearly identical (18Ichida M. Nemoto S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50991-50995Google Scholar, 30Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Google Scholar). Furthermore, in agreement with these observations, PGC-lα has been shown to induce ERRα expression (30Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Google Scholar). Our functional characterization of the ESRRA23 element clearly demonstrates it to be the direct target of PGC-lα action. However, PGC-lα is a coactivator protein that does not bind ESRRA23 3J. Barry and V. Giguère, unpublished results. and thus requires interaction with a transcription factor that has the requisite docking site on the target promoter. One clear candidate is ERRα itself. ERRα binds to the ESRRA23 element and activates transcription from it in the presence of PGC-lα and other coactivators such as GRIP-1 (data not shown). The role of ERRα as a PGC-1α DNA binding partner is further corroborated by the transient transfection experiments performed in HeLa cells and MEFs. A strong activation of the ESRRA promoter in HeLa cells is only observed in the presence of both factors, and transcriptional activation is not detected with an ERRα mutant unable to bind DNA. Using MEFs obtained from ERRα null mice, we have also shown that PGC-1α activity is considerably reduced in those cells, indicating an important and direct role for ERRα in PGC-1α action at the ESRRA promoter. We have also observed that PGC-1α retains some transcriptional activity in the ERRα null MEFs suggesting that factors other than ERRα can transduce PGC-1α activity in these cells. Indeed, PGC-1α has been shown to interact with and stimulate the activity of a large number of transcription factors, including many nuclear receptors (21Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Google Scholar). The likely candidates are nuclear receptors, because the region encoding the ESRRA23 elements contains several nuclear receptor binding sites but no recognizable binding sites for other transcription factors. It has been shown recently that treatment with the estrogen agonist diethylstilbestrol stimulates the expression of ERRα (35Liu D. Zhang Z. Gladwell W. Teng C.T. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4894-4904Google Scholar). However, our studies do not support a role for ERα in the ERRα-independent PGC-1α activity observed in ERRα null MEFs, because this activity can be detected with the use of steroid-deprived serum and that ERα does not significantly bind to the ESRRA23 element or the adjacent half-site (Fig. 2B and data not shown). We are currently investigating the role of the ERRγ isoform, a known partner of PGC-1α that recognizes the ESRRA23 element, in the control of ERRα expression. Increasing evidence points to a role for ERRα in regulating energy homeostasis. ERRα is expressed in tissues that demonstrate a high capacity for fatty acid β-oxidation such as the kidneys, heart, and brown fat (8Sladek R. Bader J.-A. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Google Scholar, 37Vanacker J.M. Bonnelye E. Delmarre C. Laudet V. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2429-2435Google Scholar). ERRα expression has been shown to be up-regulated by physiological stimuli such as cold and starvation (18Ichida M. Nemoto S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50991-50995Google Scholar, 30Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Google Scholar), and ablation of the gene in mice results in reduced fat mass and a resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity (19Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.-A. Richard D. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Google Scholar). Similarly, PGC-1α is a transcriptional coactivator for many transcription factors that control biological programs linked to energy needs (21Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Google Scholar). The results presented in this study reaffirm the existence of strong physiological and functional links between ERRα and PGC-1α action and also demonstrate the convergence of PGC-lα-based transcriptional pathways on a polymorphic hormone response element controlling ERRα expression. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that the identification of regulatory variants in the human genome can reveal physiologically relevant interactions between the distinct components of complex transcriptional pathways. It would be of interest to pursue further genetic studies to investigate whether the ESRRA23 polymorphism is linked to a particular phenotype or susceptibility to metabolic diseases in the human population, including obesity and diabetes.

The Sry (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome) gene encodes a master protein for initiating testis differentiation in mammals, and its expression is restricted to gonadal somatic cells at 10.5-12.5 days post-coitum (dpc) in the mouse. We found that in vitro methylation of the 5′-flanking region of the Sry gene caused suppression of reporter activity, implying that Sry gene expression could be regulated by DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing. Bisulfite restriction mapping and sodium bisulfite sequencing revealed that the 5′-flanking region of the Sry gene was hypermethylated in the 8.5-dpc embryos in which the Sry gene was not expressed. Importantly, this region was specifically hypomethylated in the gonad at 11.5 dpc, while the hypermethylated status was maintained in tissues that do not express the Sry gene. We concluded that expression of the Sry gene is under the control of an epigenetic mechanism mediated by DNA methylation.

The circular form is also expressed in the genital ridge, as well as in round spermatids in adult testis and in the adult brain, but is thought to be untranslated (9Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C.

Typical CCAAT and TATA boxes, located in close vicinity to the transcription start site of each form, are the putative promoters (7Jeske Y. Bowles J. Greenfield A. Koopman P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Dolci S. Grimaldi P. Geremia R. Pesce M. Rossi P. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1128-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The presence of several other putative regulatory cis-elements was indicated when sequences of the 5′-flanking region of the Sry gene from 10 different mammalian species were compared (14Margarit E. Guillen A. Rebordosa C. Vidal-Taboada J. Sanchez M. Ballesta F. Oliva R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To date, however, regulatory mechanisms for spatiotemporal expression of the Sry gene remain elusive.DNA methylation generally occurs at the cytosine of CpG dinucleotides in higher vertebrates; 60-70% of CpGs are methylated in the mammalian genome (15Gruenbaum Y. Stein R. Cedar H. Razin A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 124: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 16Razin A. Webb C. Szyf M. Yisraeli J. Rosenthal A. Naveh-Many T. Sciaky-Gallili N. Cedar H. Proc.

Methylation of DNA is involved in various developmental processes by silencing, switching, and stabilizing genes, as well as remodeling chromatin (18Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R.

Regardless of the frequency of CpGs in the regulatory region, DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation occurs in various genes (22Cho J.H. Kimura H. Minami T. Ohgane J. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3389-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Imamura T. Ohgane J. Ito S. Ogawa T. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Genomics. 2001; 76: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We found previously that there are numerous tissue-dependent differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs), which are widespread in the mammalian genome (25Shiota K. Kogo Y. Ohgane J. Imamura T. Urano A. Nishino K. Tanaka S. Hattori N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Formation of the DNA methylation pattern is one of the epigenetic events that underlie development of various tissues in mammals (26Shiota K. Yanagimachi R. Differentiation. 2002; 69: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Analysis of several stem cells, somatic cells, germ cells, and tissues revealed that DNA methylation pattern is specific to cell type (25Shiota K. Kogo Y. Ohgane J. Imamura T. Urano A. Nishino K. Tanaka S. Hattori N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To differentiate, cells must change the DNA methylation pattern. In fact, differentiation of cells is always associated with DNA methylation and demethylation, thereby forming cell type-specific DNA methylation patterns (25Shiota K. Kogo Y. Ohgane J. Imamura T. Urano A. Nishino K. Tanaka S. Hattori N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27Ohgane J. Hattori N. Oda M. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).In the present study, we first established a reporter gene assay using a primary culture of gonadal cells from mice 11.5 dpc. In the assay, in vitro DNA methylation resulted in suppression of promoter activity. In addition, CpGs in the putative promoter regions were specifically demethylated coincident with the spatiotemporal pattern of Sry gene expression. We demonstrate here that DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the Sry gene in mouse gonadal development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Treatment and Reagents—The experiments were carried out according to the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo). Mice (CD-1 (ICR) strain) were purchased from a supplier (Charles River Japan, Inc., Yokohama, Japan) and were kept under regulated temperature (22-25 °C), humidity (40-60%), and illumination cycles (14 h light and 10 h dark) throughout the experiments. Noon of the day when a vaginal plug was detected was designated as 0.5 dpc. Blastocysts at 3.5 dpc, 8.5-dpc embryos, 11.5-dpc gonads separated from mesonephros and liver, and 15.5-dpc testis and liver were collected. In promoter assays, the 11.5-dpc gonads separated from mesonephros and liver were pipetted to single cells in trypsin and collagenase solution to disperse them. Separated cells were then cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. The 11.5-dpc gonadal somatic cells used for bisulfite sequencing were dispersed and cultured for 3 h. Then the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline to remove germ cells and blood cells and then were collected. All samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. All reagents, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan).Analysis of CpG Frequency in the Sry Gene—The GC content and CpG frequency of the DNA sequences of the Sry gene were examined with a program (CpG View, version 1.4.6) provided by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (www.nih.go.jp/yoken/genebank/binaryFile/Mac).RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from tissues and cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript first-strand synthesis system For RT-PCR (Invitrogen) with hexamer random primers and 1.0 μg of total RNA in 20 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification by PCR was performed with rTaq polymerase (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan) and 2 μl of cDNA. Primer sequences were 5′-AAGCGCCCCATGAATGCATTTATGGT-3′ and 5′-ACACTTTAGCCCTCCGATGAGGCTGA-3′ for Sry (9Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Geremia R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and 5′-GACAACGTCTCCTGCATGTGCAAAG-3′ and 5′-TTCACGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAG-3′ for β-actin (28Dragatsis I. Efstratiadis A. Zeitlin S. Development. 1998; 125: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The thermocycling program used was an initial cycle of 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, for 33 and 28 cycles for Sry and β-actin, respectively.Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Expression of Sry mRNA was analyzed quantitatively using SYBR Green I real time PCR (29Yono M. Takahashi W. Pouresmail M. Johnson D.R. Foster Jr., H.E. Weiss R.M. Latifpour J. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2002; 48: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture contained 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 18 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers of Sry (9Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Geremia R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or β-actin (28Dragatsis I. Efstratiadis A. Zeitlin S. Development. 1998; 125: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described above, and 5 μl of 1:4 diluted cDNA in a total volume of 20 μl. The thermocycling program was 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min with an initial cycle of 95 °C for 10 min. Because SYBR Green I is not specific for the PCR product, after the PCR, a dissociation curve (melting curve) was constructed from the range of 60 to 98 °C to ensure that primer-dimers and other nonspecific products had been eliminated. To estimate mRNA levels, a standard curve was generated from a dilution series of the control. The slope of the standard curve generated for each detection approach was placed into the following equation to determine PCR efficiency: PCR efficiency = 10-1/slope - 1. All quantitative data, including cycle number when a reaction reaches threshold, the cycle threshold (CT), were analyzed using ABI PRISM 7000 SDS software. Expression level was calculated using the following equation: the value = 1/(1 + PCR efficiency)CT. The Sry mRNA levels were normalized by dividing concentrations of the PCR products from Sry mRNAs by those from the β-actin mRNA. Experiments were performed at least three times independently.Sry Promoter Assay in Vitro—The 5′-flanking fragment of the Sry gene was isolated from genomic DNA of CD-1 (ICR) strain mice by genomic PCR. The position of the translation start site was designated as +1. The 4.4 kb of the 5′-flanking region (from -4423 to -58: LC), the 2.0-kb upstream region of the linear transcription start site (from -2090 to -58: Lin), and 2.4 kb of the upstream region of the circular transcription start site (from -4423 to -2063: Cir) of the Sry gene were subcloned into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Constructs into which each genomic fragment was inserted in the opposite direction were used as controls (LC-as, Lin-as, and Cir-as) (Fig. 3A). The construct into which the 4.4-kb cDNA fragment of rat Dnmt1 was inserted was also used as a control. Cloning of all constructs was carried out using the bacterial strain SCS110 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which is deficient of two methylases found in most strains of Escherichia coli, Dam and Dcm methylases. Reporter constructs were methylated in vitro with 3 units of SssI methylase (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) per μg of DNA in the presence of 160 μmS-adenosylmethionine at 37 °C for 3 h. Bisulfite restriction mapping and methylcytosine-sensitive restriction enzymes were used to confirm that methylation at CpG sites was complete. The 11.5-dpc gonadal somatic cells, liver cells, and NIH 3T3 cells were collected and cultured on a 24-well plate (1.6 × 104 cells/well). Subsequently, the cells were transfected with 0.165 pmol of reporter constructs with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). To normalize firefly luciferase activity of the reporter constructs, an internal control plasmid (0.015 pmol) expressing Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK vector, Promega) was co-transfected into the cells. Promoter activity was measured at 12 h after the transfection because a peak of activity was observed at 12 h after transfection when activity was measured between 6 and 48 h after transfection (data not shown). The activities of both luciferases were determined by means of a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed at least three times independently.Genomic DNA Preparation and Genomic PCR—Tissues (<20 mg) and cells were incubated in 250 μl of lysis solution (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K) for 20 min at 55 °C. Then 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA (TE) and 30 units of RNase were added, and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. After two rounds of phenol-chloroform extraction, 150 μl of 1 m Na-acetate (pH 7.0) were added, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated. The purified DNA (<3.0 μg) was digested with HindIII. Then DNA fragments of 3.5-4.5 kb in size were gel-extracted using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen GmbH) to remove the downstream inverted repeat sequence of the Sry gene, and fragments were eluted in 30 μl of TE. In genomic PCR, the reaction contained 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1× AmpliTaq Gold buffer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTPs, 2 μm each forward and reverse primer, and 2 μl of adult ear genomic DNA solution in a total volume of 20 μl. The primers used were as follows: for Region I, 5′-GTTTGTGTCATTAAATGTTTTGAAACC-3′ and 5′-CTCTCCTTCATCTTTGTGCACAGAG-3′, and for Region II, 5′-TAAGGAAATGACAGCCAGCCCTGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCAAGCAAAACCCCTCAAGTTTGTG-3′. The thermocycling program was 43 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min with an initial cycle of 95 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was cloned and sequenced.Bisulfite Restriction Mapping and Sequencing—The bisulfite reaction, in which cytosine is converted to uracil and 5′-methylcytosine remains non-reactive (30Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D. Collis C. Watt F. Grigg G. Molloy P. Paul C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar), was carried out as described previously (22Cho J.H. Kimura H. Minami T. Ohgane J. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3389-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Imamura T. Ohgane J. Ito S. Ogawa T. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Genomics. 2001; 76: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, the HindIII-digested genomic DNAs were initially denatured with 0.3 m NaOH. Then sodium metabisulfite solution (pH 5.0) and hydroquinone were added at a final concentration of 2.0 m and 0.5 mm, respectively. The reaction mixtures were incubated under mineral oil in the dark at 55 °C for 16 h. The denatured DNA was purified with Wizard DNA purification resin (Promega), and modification was then terminated by treatment with 0.3 m NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was suspended in 30 μl of TE. Two μl of each sample were amplified with AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the primer sets IBF/IBR or IIBF/IIBR1 under the same conditions as genomic PCR described above. Half of the PCR products were digested with 5 units of TaqI (Roche Diagnostics) at 65 °C or with 5 units of HpyCH4 IV (New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 3 h for Regions I and II, respectively. The other half was used for undigested control. TaqI and HpyCH4 IV recognize 5′-TCGA-3′ and 5′-ACGT-3′ sequences, respectively. Therefore, after the bisulfite reaction, the unmethylated DNA remains intact following TaqI or HpyCH4 IV digestion (see Fig. 5A, U), whereas the methylated DNA is cleaved (see Fig. 5A, Me). The intensity of each band was determined using an image-analyzing program (NIH Image, version 1.6.1) provided by the National Institutes of Health (ftp://rsbweb.nih.gov/pub/nih-image/nih-image161_fat.hqx). The degree of methylation in each sample was calculated by the formula IMe/(IU × 541/573 + IMe) × 100 for Region I and IMe/(IU + IMe) × 100 for Region II, where IMe and IU represent the intensity of methylated and unmethylated bands, respectively, in each sample. The results from at least three independent experiments were quantified and averaged. In the case of sodium bisulfite sequencing, each PCR product amplified using primer sets IBF/IBR or IIBF/IIBR2 was cloned into pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega), and 5 or 10 clones were sequenced, then methylation status of individual CpGs was determined. As a control, plasmid DNA, which is unmethylated, was amplified and then subjected to the same analysis in parallel to confirm the completion of the bisulfite reaction. The primers used were as follows: for Region I, IBF, 5′-GTTTGTGTTATTAAATGTTTTGAAATT-3′, and IBR, 5′-TATACCTTTAACATTCTCCAAAATA-3′; and for Region II, IIBF, 5′-TAAGGAAATGATAGTTAGTTTTGAT-3′, IIBR1, 5′-ATCAAACAAAACCCCTCAAATTTATA-3′, and IIBR2, 5′-AACCCTCCATACTCTCTAAACAATTA-3′.Fig. 5DNA methylation status of Regions I and II at different developmental stages.A, bisulfite restriction mapping. Region I and Region II of blastocyst and fetal tissues were amplified by genomic PCR following sodium bisulfite reaction, and then the PCR products were digested with TaqI or HpyCH4 IV restriction enzyme. When the genomic DNA contains methylated CpG in the recognition sites, the PCR products are fragmented (Me), whereas the PCR products from the unmethylated DNA are intact (U) (shown in Fig. 1B).

These CpGs were not evenly distributed in this region but formed two approximate clusters: four CpGs in the region immediately upstream of the transcription start site of the circular form (-2997 to -2534; designated as Region I) and seven CpGs in the region immediately upstream of the transcription start site of the linear form (-893 to -299; designated as Region II). Some of these CpGs had been converted to TpG, CpT, or CpA in the CD-1 strain when DNA extracts from mice (n = 10) were analyzed (see Fig. 1A).Fig. 1Genomic organization of mouseSry. A, genomic structure of mouse Sry and positions of primers. Open and filled circles indicate CpG dinucleotide sequences in 129 mouse strain. Two moderate clusters of CpGs, Region I and II, were found immediately upstream of transcription initiation sites (arrows). Filled circles represent polymorphic sequences, which are not CpG dinucleotides in the CD-1 (ICR) strain. TaqI and HpyCH4 IV restriction enzyme sites are marked by filled and open triangles, respectively. The position of the translation start site is designated as +1. ORF, open reading frame.

At 11.5 dpc, expression of Sry was detected in the gonad but not in liver (Fig. 2A). Expression was not detected in 8.5-dpc embryos and in all 15.5-dpc tissues examined (data not shown except for testis and liver). Thus we confirmed previous reports that expression of Sry is restricted to limited tissues and to a limited period of time. We then examined Sry expression in primary cultured gonadal cells of the 11.5-dpc fetus (pcgc11.5). As expected, Sry expression was observed throughout the culture period. After 24 h of culture, however, expression became very weak and was barely detectable at 48 h of culture (Fig. 2B). We also confirmed the presence of transcript by RT real time quantitative PCR (Fig. 2C). No transcript was detectable in fetal liver cells or NIH 3T3 cells. The kinetics of Sry expression in vitro recapitulated the transient expression of Sry in vivo. Based on these results, it appears that pcgc11.5 maintained normal transcriptional activity during the early culture period; therefore, it may be possible to evaluate promoter activity using pcgc11.5.Fig. 2Sryexpression in mouse fetal tissues, primary cultured gonadal cells, and NIH 3T3 cells. Expression of Sry was analyzed by RT-PCR (A and B) and by SYBR Green I real time PCR (C). A, expression of Sry in tissues. M, DNA 100-bp ladder marker.

For the assay, six reporter constructs were made. These were (i) construct LC, containing the 4.4-kb genomic fragment (-4424 to -58) spanning promoter regions of both linear and circular forms, (ii) construct Lin, containing the 2.0-kb fragment (-2090 to -58) including the promoter region of the linear form, and (iii) construct Cir, containing the 2.4-kb fragment (-4424 to -2063) including the promoter of the circular form (Fig. 3A). The same fragments, oriented inversely, were used as controls for each construct (LC-as, Lin-as, and Cir-as). The construct 4.4kb-cont, containing the 4.4 kb of rat Dnmt1 cDNA fragment with supposedly no transcription regulatory activity, was also used as a control.Although activity of the pGL3-Basic vector was not significantly different from that of 4.4kb-cont both in fetal liver cells and in NIH 3T3 cells, it was exceptionally higher in pcgc11.5 (data not shown). Therefore, 4.4kb-cont was considered to be a more adequate control than the pGL3-Basic vector. LC showed an equivalent expression level (104%) to 4.4kb-cont, whereas activity of LC-as was less than 45% of that of 4.4kb-cont (Fig. 3B) in pcgc11.5. The activities of both LC and LC-as in fetal liver and NIH 3T3 cells were also less than 50% of 4.4kb-cont. These results suggest that the 4.4-kb upstream region of the Sry gene contains suppressive element(s) and that the gonadal cells of the 11.5-dpc fetus are capable of inducing Sry expression despite suppressive activity. Then activities of the linear and circular promoter regions were examined separately (Fig. 3, C and D). In pcgc11.5, Lin showed ∼83% expression level of LC, and activity of Cir was strongly repressed. Conversely, activity of Lin-as was barely detectable, and that of Cir-as was suppressed to a level comparable with that of LC-as. In fetal liver cells and NIH 3T3 cells, expression of all constructs was strongly suppressed. Therefore, both linear and circular promoter regions likely contain suppressive element(s). The 2.0-kb upstream region of the linear form transcription start site contains expression-inducing element(s). However, the 2.4-kb upstream region of the circular form transcription start site demonstrated cryptic promoter activity in the inverse direction in pcgc11.5.DNA Methylation Suppressed Sry Activity—Next, we examined whether DNA methylation affects promoter activity. In vitro methylation of LC-as strongly inhibited activity in pcgc11.5 (Fig. 4A, columns 1 and 2). Activity of LC also was suppressed by DNA methylation to the level of LC-as (Fig. 4A, columns 3 and 4). Likewise, in vitro methylation repressed reporter activity of both Lin and Lin-as in pcgc11.5 (Fig. 4B, columns 1-4). In the circular promoter region, promoter activity was difficult to detect, except for Cir-as in pcgc11.5, and DNA methylation also suppressed this activity (Fig. 4C). In any case, DNA methylation clearly suppressed activities of all constructs. Given these results, hypomethylation likely is required to sustain Sry expression in gonadal cells.Fig. 4DNA methylation suppressed promoter a"
https://openalex.org/W2100588235,"Arterioles exposed to norepinephrine (NE) for 4 h exhibit incomplete relaxation on removal of the agonist. We hypothesized that this is due to a mechanoadaptation process associated with active repositioning of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within the vascular wall. Isolated arterioles were exposed to NE (10(-5.5) M) for either 5 min (n = 7) or 4 h (n = 13). During the 5-min exposure, vessel diameter was reduced to 61 +/- 2.6%, and cells shortened to 76.3 +/- 3.8% of control. After NE removal, vessel diameter and cell length returned to control values, which indicated that during acute vasoconstriction cells shorten and relengthen in a reversible fashion. In contrast, when NE exposure lasted 4 h, vessels did not return to control diameter, but VSMCs returned to control length after NE removal. During the 4-h constriction, 56% of the VSMCs began returning to control length, and the overlap between VSMCs increased, which indicated that cellular repositioning had occurred in the presence of the maintained constriction. Thus, in response to prolonged constriction, VSMCs undergo a mechanoadaptation process involving ""length autoregulation"" that would be energetically favorable for maintenance of a reduced diameter and may provide a mechanism for the development of eutrophic remodeling of the vascular wall."
https://openalex.org/W2056081796,"Transcription and repair of many DNA helix-distorting lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers have been shown to be coupled in cells across phyla from bacteria to humans. The signal for transcription-coupled repair appears to be a stalled transcription complex at the lesion site. To determine whether oxidative DNA lesions can block correctly initiated human RNA polymerase II, we examined the effect of site-specifically introduced oxidative damages on transcription in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. We found that transcription was blocked by single-stranded breaks, common oxidative DNA lesions, when present in the transcribed strand of the transcription template. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, which have been previously shown to block transcription both in vitro and in vivo, also blocked transcription in the HeLa cell nuclear transcription assay. In contrast, the oxidative DNA base lesions, 8-oxoguanine, 5-hydroxycytosine, and thymine glycol did not inhibit transcription, although pausing was observed with the thymine glycol lesion. Thus, DNA strand breaks but not oxidative DNA base damages blocked transcription by RNA polymerase II.

Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Google Scholar). TCR was originally believed to be a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair; however, ionizing radiation damage (3Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10499-10503Google Scholar), 5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymine (thymine glycol; Tg) (4Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A.

Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Google Scholar), and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) (5Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Google Scholar) are removed in a TCR-dependent manner from human cells that lack nucleotide excision repair. Since Tg and 8-oxoG are small nonbulky lesions that are repaired primarily by the base excision repair (BER) pathway (for reviews, see Refs. 6Wallace S.S. Scandalios J. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 49-90Google Scholar, 7McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu.

Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Google Scholar) links TCR to BER. TCR of 8-oxoG has also been shown to occur in nonreplicating Escherichia coli cells (9Bregeon D. Doddridge Z.A. You H.J. Weiss B. Doetsch P.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 959-970Google Scholar). TCR of oxidative damage does not appear to be universal, since in Chinese hamster ovary cells, TCR of oxidative damage produced by photosensitization and oxidizing agents is not observed in the Dhfr and cFos genes (10Taffe B.G. Larminat F. Laval J. Croteau D.L. Anson R.M. Bohr V.A. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 183-192Google Scholar, 11Thorslund T. Sunesen M. Bohr V.A. Stevnsner T. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 261-273Google Scholar, 12Grishko V.I. Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 73-80Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNA strand breaks, oxidative lesions also repaired by BER, do not appear to be repaired by TCR in the Dhfr gene from Chinese hamster ovary cells (13Ljungman M. Radiat. Res. 1999; 152: 444-449Google Scholar) or human colon cancer cells (14May A. Bohr V.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 433-437Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent measurements of TCR of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in the Hprt gene, integrated at different sites in Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomes, have suggested that preferential repair of actively transcribed genes, as well as preferential repair of damages in the transcribed strand, is significantly affected by genomic context (15Feng Z. Hu W. Komissarova E. Pao A. Hung M.C. Adair G.M. Tang M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12777-12783Google Scholar). The proposed signal for TCR is an RNA polymerase transcription complex stalled at a lesion, which recruits the repair proteins to the damage site (16Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Google Scholar, 17Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Google Scholar, 18Park J.-S. Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Cell. 2002; 109: 757-767Google Scholar); the ability of a lesion on the transcribed strand to block the RNA polymerase transcription complex has been assumed to be crucial for TCR. In addition to bulky lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, DNA polymerases are blocked by a number of oxidative lesions including sites of base loss (AP sites), single-stranded breaks (SSBs), and Tg, which are thus potentially lethal lesions (for reviews, see Refs. 19Hatahet Z.

Res. 1998; 150: S60-S79Google Scholar, 21Wallace S.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1-14Google Scholar). DNA polymerases bypass 5,6-dihydrothymine, 5-hydroxycytosine (5-OHC), 5-hydroxyuracil, 5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrouracil, dihydrouracil, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoadenine, and 8-oxoG. The oxidized cytosine lesions and 8-oxoG are potentially mutagenic, since they can mispair (for reviews, see Refs. 19Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair.

In many cases, the effects of oxidative DNA damages on transcription by RNA polymerases differ from their effects on DNA polymerases. Tg is a block to T7 RNA polymerase (23Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 346-348Google Scholar, 24Tornaletti S. Maeda L.S. Lloyd D.R. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45367-45371Google Scholar, 25Chen Y.H. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5849-5855Google Scholar). However, RNA polymerase II, partially purified from rat liver, completely bypassed Tg lesions in the transcribed strand located downstream from the adenovirus major late promoter, and the addition of fractions containing transcription factor II D and transcription factor II H (TFIIH) did not have any measurable effect (24Tornaletti S. Maeda L.S. Lloyd D.R. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45367-45371Google Scholar). As with DNA polymerases, 8-oxoG does not block T7 (23Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 346-348Google Scholar, 25Chen Y.H. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5849-5855Google Scholar) or E. coli RNA polymerase in vitro (26Viswanathan A. Doetsch P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21276-21281Google Scholar) or in cells (9Bregeon D. Doddridge Z.A. You H.J. Weiss B. Doetsch P.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 959-970Google Scholar) and at best stalls RNA polymerase II in vitro with a template containing a poly(C) tail (27Kuraoka I. Endou M. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7294-7299Google Scholar). In contrast to DNA polymerases, abasic sites in a poly(C)-tailed template are easily bypassed by RNA polymerase II (27Kuraoka I. Endou M. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7294-7299Google Scholar); abasic sites are also bypassed by T7 RNA polymerase (19Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair. Vol. 1. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 229-262Google Scholar, 25Chen Y.H. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5849-5855Google Scholar), SP6 (28Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6605Google Scholar), and E. coli (28Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6605Google Scholar) RNA polymerase. A single-stranded break is a common oxidative lesion produced directly by free radicals and as BER processing intermediates. Depending on the 5′- and 3′-end chemistries at the strand break site, single-stranded breaks in the transcribed strand can block transcription by SP6, Escherichia coli, and T7 RNA polymerase. T7 RNA polymerase bypasses an SSB with an intact deoxyribose at the 3′ terminus and a hydroxyl group on the 5′ terminus (28Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6605Google Scholar, 29Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14926-14934Google Scholar), whereas a single nucleotide gap with terminal 3′- and 5′-phosphoryl groups blocks transcription by SP6, E. coli, and T7 RNA polymerase (28Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6605Google Scholar, 29Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14926-14934Google Scholar). When gaps in the transcribed strand are bypassed by prokaryotic RNA polymerases, the corresponding transcripts are shortened by the length of the gap (30Zhou W. Reines D. Doetsch P.W. Cell. 1995; 82: 577-585Google Scholar, 31Liu J. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14999-15008Google Scholar). Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS) are two rare human hereditary disorders that are caused by defective DNA repair (for a review, see Ref. 32Thompson L.H. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair: DNA Repair in Higher Eukaryotes. Vol. 2. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 335-393Google Scholar). Xeroderma pigmentosum patients lack nucleotide excision repair and are cancer-prone, whereas Cockayne syndrome patients retain nucleotide excision repair and are not cancer-prone (32Thompson L.H. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair: DNA Repair in Higher Eukaryotes. Vol. 2. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 335-393Google Scholar). Patients with Cockayne syndrome can be divided into two complementation groups, CS-A or CS-B (33Lehmann A.R. Mutat. Res. 1982; 106: 347-356Google Scholar, 34Tanaka K. Kawai K. Kumahara Y. Ikenaga M. Okada Y. Somatic Cell Genet. 1981; 7: 445-455Google Scholar). The gene products associated with these complementation groups are required for TCR (3Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10499-10503Google Scholar, 35Venema J. Mullenders L.H. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4707-4711Google Scholar). Although CSA and CSB do not form stable complexes (36van Gool A. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W. Constantinou A. Egly J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Google Scholar), they interact with each other and the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIIH (37Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Schultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V. Friedberg E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 555-564Google Scholar) and function in the TCR process. Cockayne syndrome cells have defects in the TCR of oxidative lesions (3Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10499-10503Google Scholar, 4Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Google Scholar, 5Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Google Scholar). Some xeroderma pigmentosum patients from the XP-B, XP-D, and XP-G complementation groups also exhibit the neurological and developmental deficiencies associated with Cockayne syndrome compounded by the sun sensitivity and skin cancer susceptibility associated with xeroderma pigmentosum. The XPB and XPD gene products are helicase components of TFIIH and interact with three other TFIIH subunits, p62, p44, and p34 (38Iyer N. Reagan M.S. Wu K.J. Canagarajah B. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2157-2167Google Scholar). XPG interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and CSB (38Iyer N. Reagan M.S. Wu K.J. Canagarajah B. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2157-2167Google Scholar) and is required for TCR as well as global genomic repair of Tg (4Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Google Scholar) and 8-oxoG (5Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Google Scholar). TCR of oxidative damages in mammals is paradoxical, since the proposed signal for TCR is a stalled RNA polymerase complex, but most oxidative DNA damages do not appear to block purified RNA polymerases. In this study, we asked whether oxidative DNA lesions block transcription by correctly initiated RNA polymerase II and thus serve as the signal for TCR. To address this, we carried out in vitro transcription assays with HeLa cell nuclear extracts, commonly used for transcription studies, and DNA templates containing oxidative damages placed downstream from the HIV-1 promoter and determined whether the damaged templates blocked transcription in a nuclear run-off assay. We also assumed that any constitutive activities essential to block transcription and signal TCR would be present in the extracts. In order to determine whether oxidative damages could block RNA polymerase II, specific oxidative lesions and a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer known to block transcription (39Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Google Scholar) were inserted into the transcribed strand of the template at a defined distance from the transcription start site. A thymine-thymine dimer was used as the representative cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer lesion in our study. We found that correctly initiated RNA polymerase II from HeLa cell nuclear extracts was blocked by site-specifically introduced single-stranded breaks. As expected, a site-specific cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer also blocked transcription. In contrast, the oxidized base lesions tested, 8-oxoG, 5-OHC, and Tg, did not block RNA polymerase II. Some of the 5-OHC and Tg lesions were, however, converted to single-stranded breaks during the transcription assay, which then blocked transcription at these sites. In addition, RNA polymerase II initially paused at Tg, but eventually most of the transcription complexes bypassed this damage. Introduction of Unique Damages to Transcription Templates—The damages in the transcription templates were located exclusively on the transcribed strand throughout this study. PCR was used to generate the transcription templates with lesions that do not block DNA polymerases. A sequence containing the M13 reverse sequencing primer plus additional sequence (TGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG) (obtained from Operon, Alameda, CA) and the oligoncleotides containing the lesion to be studied (GGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCATTCCAGACTGTCAATAACACGG8-oxoGGGACCAGTCGATCCTGGGCTGCAGGAATTC (obtained from Operon, Alameda, CA), GGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCATTCCAGACTGTCAATAACACGGUGGACCAGTCGATCCTGGGCTGCAGGAATTC (obtained from Operon, Alameda, CA) and ATTCCAGACTGTCAATAACACGG5-OHCGGACCAGTCGATCCTGGGCTGCAGGAATTC) (laboratory stock prepared by Dr. Zafer Hatahet) were used to generate the double-stranded transcription template. Transcription templates containing 8-oxoguanine and uracil and 5-hydroxycytosine were produced using this method. The PCR template was a single-stranded circular M13mp19 derivative containing the HIV-1 promoter and damage sequence (Fig. 1A). An AP site (site of base loss) was introduced in the transcription template by incubating the uracil-containing PCR product with uracil DNA glycosylase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. Single nucleotide gaps with different 3′-end chemistries were produced by incubating the AP site-containing transcription template with endonuclease III (supplied by Dr. Zafer Hatahet, University of Texas, Tyler, TX), endonuclease IV (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), or endonuclease VIII (laboratory stock prepared as described by Jiang et al. (40Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Blaisdell J.O. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Google Scholar)) in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm ETDA, 50 mm NaCl for 1 h at 37 °C, which results in a 3′-terminal unsaturated aldehyde, hydroxyl, or phosphate group, respectively (40Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Blaisdell J.O. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Google Scholar, 41Kim J. Linn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1135-1141Google Scholar, 42Bailly V. Verly W.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 761-768Google Scholar). The 5′-end group generated by endonucleases III and VIII was a terminal phosphate, whereas the 5′-end group generated by endonuclease IV was a deoxyribose. The single nucleotide gap with a 3′-hydroxyl and a 5′-phosphate was made by incubating the AP site-containing transcription template with endonuclease IV followed by formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) (laboratory stock) (43Bailly V. Verly W.G. O'Connor T. Laval J. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 581-589Google Scholar). A different strategy was employed to produce the in vitro transcription templates containing a Tg or a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), since these lesions block DNA polymerases. To prepare these transcription templates, oligonucleotides complementary to the M13mp19 derivative on either side of the insert site were annealed to the single-stranded circular M13mp19 derivative and the DNA cut by restriction enzymes with sites in the double-stranded regions. The ∼1-kb single-stranded DNA containing the HIV-1 promoter and the damage sequences was purified from an agarose gel and used as a template for Sequenase V2.0 (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH). 10 pmol of a 54-mer containing Tg (laboratory stock prepared by Dr. Zafer Hatahet) (ATTCCAGACTGTCAATAACACGGTgGGACCAGTCGATCCTGGGCTGCAGGAATTC) was annealed to ∼5 pmol of single-stranded, linearized, ∼1-kb DNA template in water by heating to 65 °C for 10 min and cooling to room temperature over a 10-min time period. Ten pmol of a 71-mer containing the CPD (generously provided by Dr. Christopher Lawrence, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and modified in our laboratory to extend the length) (AATTAGAGTCATTCCAGACTGCAGGCPDGGAGGTCAATAACACGGGGGACCAGTCGATCCTGGGCTGCAGGAATTC) was annealed to ∼5 pmol of single-stranded, linear, 1-kb template in water and cooled as described above for the Tg-containing primer. The primers were extended with 65 units of Sequenase V2.0 (USB Corporation) in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 2 mm dNTPs for 30 min at 37 °C (Fig. 1B). These transcription templates were purified from an agarose gel (Qiaquick gel purification system; Qiagen). In Vitro Transcription with Templates Containing Unique Lesions— Transcription reactions were carried out at 30 °C in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 20% glycerol with 25 ng of the transcription template (44Laspia M.F. Rice A.P. Mathews M.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 283-292Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated with 92.5 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract (Promega) for 5 min to allow the RNA polymerase transcription complex to assemble at the HIV-1 promoter. Transcription was initiated by the addition of ATP, CTP, and GTP to 400 μm, UTP to 16 μm, and [α-32P]UTP to 0.132 μm to give a final volume of 25 μl and, subsequently, transcription template at 1.5 nm. Transcription was carried out for 1, 2, 5, and 10 min (two additional time points, 20 and 30 min, were taken with the Tg transcription template) and was terminated by the addition of 175 μl of stop solution (300 μm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 25 °C), 300 μm sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and 3 μg/ml tRNA). The terminated transcription reactions were extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform, mixed on a vortexer at maximum speed for 10 s, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube containing 15 μg of glycoBlue (Ambion), and 500 μl of ethanol was added. The samples were incubated for at least 30 min at -20 °C and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellets were air-dried and suspended in 4 μl of nuclease-free water followed by the addition of an equal volume of loading dye (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The samples were heated in a boiling water bath for 5–10 min, separated on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and visualized by autoradiography and/or analysis with an isotope imaging system (Molecular Images FX System, Bio-Rad). Determination of BER Activities in HeLa Cell Nuclear Extracts— Oligonucleotides containing a furan, dihydrouracil (DHU), and 8-oxoG, substrates for hAPE1, hNTH1 (also NEIL1 and NEIL2), and hOGG1, respectively, were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The complementary strand was added to the labeled oligo (1:1 molar ratio), heated to 70 °C for 10 min, and cooled to room temperature to create the double-stranded substrate. Enzymatic incision of the substrates by the HeLa cell nuclear extracts was determined as follows. In each case, 10 fmol of labeled substrate was incubated with the extracts at 37 °C in a volume of 10 μl and terminated at 0, 5, 15, and 30 min by the addition of 98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. The furan-containing oligonucleotide (Microbiology and Molecular Genetics DNA Synthesis Facility, University of Vermont) (5′-AAGCTTGGCACTGFuranCCGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTG-3′) annealed to its complement, was incubated with 36.4 ng of HeLa cell nuclear extract in 45 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 70 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2. The 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotide (Microbiology and Molecular Genetics DNA Synthesis Facility, University of Vermont) (5′-AAGCTTGGCACTGGCC8-oxoGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTG-3′) annealed to its complement, was incubated with 3.64 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol. The DHU-containing oligonucleotide (University of Vermont, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics DNA Synthesis Facility) (5′-AAGCTTGGCACTGGCCGTDHUGTTTTACAACGTCGTG-3′) annealed to its complement was incubated with 1.82 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract in 45 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 70 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA. Ten fmol of the substrate containing a furan, DHU, and 8-oxoG were also incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extracts under the in vitro transcription buffer conditions described above to determine if the damage in the double-stranded 35-mer was still present at the end of the transcription assay. Detection of the Lesion in the Transcription Template—Transcription templates containing the oxidative lesions studied were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and either assayed for the presence of the lesion or added (15 fmol) to the transcription reaction as described previously except that nonradioactive UTP was substituted for the [α-32P]UTP. The transcription reaction was carried out as described above for 10 min for the AP sites, single-stranded breaks, 5-OHC, and 8-oxoG, 30 min in the case of the Tg-containing template. The nucleic acids were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The nucleic acids were suspended in distilled H2O, and the template was restricted with EcoRI in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT (pH 7.9 at 25 °C) and purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to remove the restriction enzyme and exchange the buffer to 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. To assay for the presence of the lesion, 2.5 fmol of template/substrate was incubated with 60 fmol of the appropriate enzyme for 60 min at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl. The oligonucleotide containing the CPD dimer was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to its complementary strand. The double-stranded CPD dimer substrate was incubated with T4 endonuclease V (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) at 37 °C in 25 mm NaPO4 (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 60 min. All reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of loading dye (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). All samples, except the AP site-containing DNA, were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min before subsequent separation on a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. The results were visualized and quantified by autoradiography and/or analysis on an isotope imaging system (Molecular Images FX System, Bio-Rad). RNA Polymerase II Transcription Is Blocked by Site-specific Single-stranded Breaks in the Template Strand—To determine what effect SSBs had on transcription by RNA polymerase II, we carried out run-off transcription assays with HeLa cell nuclear extracts on templates containing SSBs with different end chemistries located on the transcribed strand downstream from the HIV-1 promoter. For all transcription reactions, the extent of lesion bypass is calculated as the amount of full-length transcript divided by the amount of full-length transcript plus blocked transcript and quantified using an isotope imaging system. The number of radioactive nucleotides incorporated into the transcript was taken into account, since the difference in the number of radioactive nucleotides incorporated between the run-off transcript and a transcript blocked at the lesion was significant (∼7% in the case of the 54-mer damage-containing oligonucleotides and ∼9% in the case of the 71-mer damage-containing oligonucleotides). All SSBs tested inhibited transcription by RNA polymerase II (Fig. 2). It should be noted that all the SSBs examined here are actually single base gaps where the gaps have the end chemistries described and are intermediates in the BER process. An SSB with a 3′-unsaturated aldehyde and a 5′-phosphate caused almost 90% blockage between 2 and 10 min from transcript initiation (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4, and Table II). An SSB with a 3′-hydroxyl and a 5′-deoxyribose demonstrated ∼80% blockage between 2 and 10 min (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8, and Table II), whereas an SSB with a 3′-phosphate and a 5′-phosphate showed about 85% blockage between 2 and 10 min (Fig. 2, lanes 10–12, and Table II). Finally, an SSB with a 3′-hydroxyl and a 5′-phosphate demonstrated just over 75% blockage at 2 min that decreased to ∼65% at 10 min (Fig. 2, lanes 14–16, and Table II). The majority of transcripts had a length of ∼364 nucleotides (nt), which corresponds to the position of the SSB. The transcription template containing an SSB with a 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-deoxyribose produced an additional transcript at ∼344 nt (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8). Some transcripts corresponding to full length were produced from all of the SSB-containing transcription templates, due to a small fraction of the template that did not contain a SSB as well as possible repair of the SSB by the nuclear extract. In fact, there were 10–20% fewer SSB in the transcription templates after the assay (see Table I), suggesting that some repair did occur (see below). Some full-length transcripts may reflect lesion bypass and presumably would be 1 nt shorter than a full-length transcript. The limited resolution of the 6% poly-acrylamide gel used in these assays did not allow us to discern whether the longest transcripts are actually full-length or 1 nt short of full-length as a consequence of single nucleotide gap bypass in the transcribed strand. At 10 min, the SSB with a 3′-unsaturated aldehyde and a 5′-phosphate showed little by-pass (Fig. 2, lane 4, and Table II), whereas the SSBs with a 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-deoxyribose (Fig. 2, lane 8) or a 3′-phosphate and a 5′-phosphate (Fig. 2, lane 12) showed about 20% bypass (Table II).

https://openalex.org/W2071854990,"The alternative sigma factor σS (RpoS) of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase regulates the expression of stationary phase and stress-response genes. σS is also required for the transcription of the cryptic genes csgBA that encode the subunits of the curli proteins. The expression of the csgBA genes is regulated in response to a multitude of physiological signals. In stationary phase, these genes are transcribed by the σS factor, and expression of the operon is enhanced by the small protein Crl. It has been shown that Crl stimulates the activity of σS, leading to an increased transcription rate of a subset of genes of the rpoS regulon in stationary phase. However, the underlying molecular mechanism has remained elusive. We show here that Crl interacts directly with σS and that this interaction promotes binding of the σS holoenzyme (EσS) to the csgBA promoter. Expression of Crl is increased during the transition from growing to stationary phase. Crl accumulates in stationary phase cells at low temperature (30 °C) but not at 37 °C. We therefore propose that Crl is a second thermosensor, besides DsrA, controlling σS activity.

We therefore propose that Crl is a second thermosensor, besides DsrA, controlling σS activity. RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli is composed of a core enzyme (E) with subunit structure α2ββ′ which associates with one of seven different σ subunits to form the holoenzyme (Eσ). The core enzyme carries the RNA polymerization function, and the σ subunit is required for promoter recognition and binding (1Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 2Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Each σ subunit targets RNA polymerase to a different set of promoters, thereby profoundly modulating the gene expression pattern (3Gaal T. Ross W. Estrem S.T. Nguyen L.H. Burgess R.R. Gourse R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 939-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 4Ishihama A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the σ70 subunit is responsible for the transcription of the majority of genes during exponential growth. Upon entry into stationary phase, σ38 also called σS and encoded by the rpoS gene, begins to accumulate in the cell, associates with the core enzyme, and directs the transcription of genes essential for stationary phase survival (5Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 6Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The synthesis of σS is also induced in response to many other stress conditions such as high osmolarity, low pH, and high temperature. σS is therefore considered a general stress-response regulator (8Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1600-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 9Small P. Blankenhorn D. Welty D. Zinser E. Slonczewski J.L. J.

Regulation of σS occurs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and involves numerous regulators. In brief, σS accumulates at the beginning of stationary phase because of many factors acting in concert: increased transcription of the rpoS gene, stabilization and activation of the rpoS mRNA, as well as increased protein stability (8Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1600-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). A number of small molecules, RNAs, and proteins belong to the complex regulatory network that controls σS expression; ppGpp (the stringent control signal) (11Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7982-7989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), homoserine lactone (12Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Science. 1994; 265: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), inorganic phosphate (13Shiba T. Tsutsumi K. Yano H. Ihara Y. Kameda A. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Munekata M. Rao N.N. Kornberg A.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1600-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) have been reported to influence the transcription of rpoS. The nucleoid-associated protein HU, the histone-like protein H-NS, and the small regulatory RNAs DsrA and OxyS in conjugation with the RNA chaperone Hfq control the translation of rpoS by modulating the secondary structure of the rpoS mRNA (15Balandina A. Claret L. Hengge-Aronis R. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Repoila F. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4012-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). σS proteolysis is controlled by the response regulator RssB (the σS recognition factor) and the ClpXP protease (recently reviewed in Ref. 17Hengge-Aronis R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Despite this abundance of information about the regulation of σS expression, little is known about the regulation of σS activity. The total concentration of σS does not exceed one-third of the concentration of σ70 even at the onset of stationary phase when σS concentration is at its highest (18Jishage M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6832-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Jishage M. Iwata A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5447-5451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, among all σ factors, σS has the lowest affinity for the core enzyme (20Maeda H. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3497-3503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). σS thus appears to be in a difficult position in the competition for binding to core enzyme. Recently, it has been shown that ppGpp modulates this competition in favor of σS (21Jishage M. Kvint K. Shingler V. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Other factors, such as glutamate, trehalose, and inorganic polyphosphate, modulate the activity of σS holoenzyme at the steps of holoenzyme formation and/or holoenzyme binding to promoters (22Ding Q. Kusano S. Villarejo M. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Kusano S. Ishihama A. J.

In addition, recent studies have identified the crl gene product as a regulator of σS activity (25Pratt L.A. Silhavy T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Schnetz K. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Crl is known for stimulating the transcription of csgBA, the operon encoding for the two curli subunits, in a σS-dependent manner (27Olsen A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Sukupolvi S. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Arnqvist A. Olsen A. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Hammar M. Arnqvist A. Bian Z. Olsen A. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In a crl null strain, the transcriptional activity of the csgBA promoter is reduced ∼4-fold compared with the wild type strain (25Pratt L.A. Silhavy T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Curli fibers are thin aggregative surface fimbriae, which are involved in cell-cell attachment (30Romling U. Bian Z. Hammar M. Sierralta W.D. Normark S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 722-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Romling U. Sierralta W.D. Eriksson K. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and adhesion to extracellular matrices (32Olsen A. Jonsson A. Normark S. Nature. 1989; 338: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 33Hammar M. Bian Z. Normark S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Curli are expressed under special environmental conditions, such as low temperature, low osmolarity, and in stationary phase (32Olsen A. Jonsson A. Normark S. Nature. 1989; 338: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 35Olsen A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Normark S. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 272-274PubMed Google Scholar). Control of curli production in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium involves a complex network of regulatory proteins. Global regulators such as H-NS (27Olsen A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Sukupolvi S. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Arnqvist A. Olsen A. Normark S. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 722-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and IHF (36Gerstel U. Park C. Romling U. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) control the expression of the curli. Osmolarity sensing occurs through the two-component regulatory systems EnvZ/OmpR and CpxA/CpxR (37Prigent-Combaret C. Vidal O. Dorel C. Lejeune P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5993-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Dorel C. Vidal O. Prigent-Combaret C. Vallet I. Lejeune P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 169-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but temperature-sensing of curli expression is not understood. In the present study we have investigated, at the molecular and the physiological levels, the mechanism by which Crl influences σS activity. We report that Crl interacts directly with the σS subunit in vitro. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) 1The abbreviations used are: EMSA, electrophoretic mobility-shift assays; Cm, chloramphenicol; DTT, dithiothreitol; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Kn, kanamycin; wt, wild type. indicate that Crl associates with the transcriptional complex formed by the EσS (σS holoenzyme) and the csgBA promoter (pcsgBA). Our work provides evidence that Crl positively controls EσS recruitment to pcsgBA. Immunoblot analysis of Crl demonstrates that Crl expression is growth phase- and temperature-dependent. Strains and Plasmids—The genotypes of E. coli K12 strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I.

The rpoS mutation was transferred from the strain ZK1000 (42Bohannon D.E. Connell N. Keener J. Tormo A. Espinosa-Urgel M. Zambrano M.M. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4482-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to W3110. Transduction of the rpoS::Knr allele was obtained by selection on Kn plates. We verified by Southern blot that the mutations were introduced at the correct locus. All clones were stored at –80 °C in a 20% glycerol solution. Overproduction and Purification of His6-σs and His6-Crl Proteins— The coding sequence of the rpoS gene was cloned on a His6 tag PQE-30 vector (Qiagen), yielding the pHis6-σS plasmid as described (43Becker G. Klauck E. Hengge-Aronis R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6439-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To produce the His6-Crl fusion protein, we PCR-amplified the coding region of the crl gene using chromosomal DNA from the W3110 strain as template and the primers C5 (5′-ACGTTACCGAGTGGACAC-3′) and C6 (5′-CGCCGTTAACTTCACCGG-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned into pQE-30 UA vector (Qiagen), yielding the pHis6-Crl plasmid. The E. coli strains FI1202 and M15[pREP4], transformed with pHis6-σS and pHis6-Crl, respectively, were grown in LB medium containing selective antibiotics until an A600 of 0.6. We then added isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm. After 5–6 h of induction, cells were harvested and stored at –80 °C until use. Cell lysates were prepared under native conditions. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) before sonication. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the soluble fractions were applied to a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 10× column volumes of buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), followed by elution with buffer E (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). In control experiments we used a similar protocol except that the sample was incubated with either 600 units of micrococcal nuclease or 300 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 30 min at room temperature before the washes. When needed, the eluates were purified by gel filtration using an Amersham Biosciences PD-10 desalting column equilibrated with storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, EDTA 0.1 mm, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v), and the samples were stored at –20 °C until use. His6-σ70 was a generous gift of A. Kolb. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analysis of Proteins—Crude cell extracts under native conditions were prepared as follows. Cells were grown in LB medium at 30 or 37 °C for the time indicated. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) before sonication. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the soluble fractions were stored at –80 °C. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Amersham Biosciences prestained protein standards were used for molecular weight estimation. Antibodies against Crl were produced in rabbits by injecting highly purified His6-Crl protein (Eurogentec). Antibodies against σS were a gift from R. Hengge-Aronis (8Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1600-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). No cross-reaction was observed for the antibodies used in this study. The immunoblot analysis of proteins electrotransferred (Bio-Rad system) onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) was performed with polyclonal antibodies raised against Crl and σS as described previously. The blots were developed either with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) systems, and staining intensity was quantified with the ImageGauge (Fujifilm) software. Gel Filtration—Gel filtration was performed using the AKTA system (Amersham Biosciences). Samples of 500 μl containing 167 μg of either His6-Crl (13.5 nmol) or His6-σS (5 nmol) or both proteins in a 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, buffer (containing EDTA 0.2 mm, 500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. Filtration was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.250 ml/min. Fifty fractions of 500 μl each were collected and analyzed by immunoblot, as indicated previously, to determine the protein content of each fraction. The column was calibrated using molecular weight standards from Amersham Biosciences. EMSA—The E. coli RNA polymerase core enzyme was purchased from Epicenter Technologies. DNA for binding assay was generated by PCR from pTOPO-pcsgBA plasmid and by using the primers C1 (5′-ATACTTTGGTATGAACTAAAAAAGAA-3′) and C2 (5′-CTGGTCGTACATTTAAGAAATT-3′). The PCR product (158 bp) from –81 to +77 of csgBA promoter region (named pcsgBA) was purified (Qiagen) and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding assays with purified proteins were conducted in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0,1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 6 ng/μl herring sperm DNA as competitor, 1 nm labeled DNA, 20 nm RNA polymerase core enzyme, 60 nm His6-σS protein or 60 nm His6-σ70, and 120 nm His6-Crl protein. The purified proteins were diluted into the reaction buffer (see above) before use. The σ subunits were pre-incubated with His6-Crl for 10 min at room temperature before reconstitution of holoenzymes (see below). The core enzyme and the σ subunits (with or without His6-Crl) were mixed at a ratio of 1:3 in reaction buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Binding of EσS or Eσ70 to the csgBA promoter region was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C in order to allow open complex formation. The reaction mixtures were loaded on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and then run with HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 3 watts for 30–45 min at room temperature. Binding assays with crude extracts (1 μg/μl) were conducted in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 nm labeled DNA, and 6 ng/μl herring sperm DNA as competitor. Binding was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was loaded on a 4–10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel and then run with TBE-1× buffer at 2 watts for 72 min with a cooling system. Gels were dried before being scanned and quantified using a FLA-8000 PhosphorImager (Fujifilm). Intensity profiles of the retarded bands were fitted to a Lorentzian curve shape as shown in Equation 1, (y=A1+[(x−xmean)⋅2σ]2)(Eq. 1) in order to separate and quantify accurately the overlapping peaks. Footprinting Experiment—A 0.175-kb fragment containing the csgBA promoter was produced by PCR using primers P1(5′-ATCGGTCGACCTTTGGTATGAACTAAAAAAGAA-3′) and P2(5′-CGATCTCGAGCTGGTCGTACATTTAAGAAATT-3′) containing SalI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. The 175-bp DNA products were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, using T4 polynucleotide kinase prior to being digested with either SalI or XhoI in order to produce a DNA fragment with only one labeled end. The reaction mixture (50 μl) containing end-labeled DNA (1 nm) and reconstituted RNA polymerase (20 nm core enzyme and 60 nm His6-σS), with or without His6-Crl (20–200 nm) in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0,1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin), was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The σS subunit was pre-incubated with His6-Crl for 10 min at room temperature before reconstitution of the holoenzyme. DNase I (3 ng) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 μl of stop solution (4 m ammonium acetate and 0,2 μg/ml herring sperm DNA). DNA was precipitated from the reaction mixture with LiCl and ethanol. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 8 m urea. Gels were dried before being autoradiographed and finally quantified using a FLA-8000 PhosphorImager (Fujifilm). Unmodified bands were used for normalization of the results. Crl interacts directly with the σS subunit—The crl gene product stimulates the expression of curli fimbriae (44Arnqvist A. Olsen A. Pfeifer J. Russell D.G. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which are involved in cell-cell aggregation and adhesion to extracellular matrices (32Olsen A. Jonsson A. Normark S. Nature. 1989; 338: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Transcription of csgBA, coding for the two subunits of the curli, is activated by Crl in a σS-dependent way (27Olsen A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Sukupolvi S. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 44Arnqvist A. Olsen A. Pfeifer J. Russell D.G. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Crl has a stimulatory effect on the expression of many other σS-activated genes (25Pratt L.A. Silhavy T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and it participates in the negative effects of σS on the expression of ompF (45Pratt L.A. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and the bgl operon (26Schnetz K. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Crl therefore either (i) increases σS expression or (ii) somehow stimulates σS activity. We eliminated the first possibility because neither the expression of a transcriptional rpoS::lacZ fusion (data not shown) nor the σS levels are reduced in a crl mutant strain (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 1 and 2). These data agree with the results published by Pratt and Silhavy (25Pratt L.A. Silhavy T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), who observed a greater amounts of σS in a crl null strain than in wild type cells. The most straightforward way to investigate the second possibility would be to test the effect of Crl on σS-dependent transcription in vitro. Unfortunately, Crl did not significantly modify the activity of σS as measured by this assay (data not shown). We therefore used a less direct approach to investigate this second hypothesis. We used His6-tagged protein fusions and Ni-NTA-agarose as an affinity matrix for His6-Crl in an in vitro binding assay. This method was chosen in order to get rid of possible aggregation of His6-Crl proteins when purified. Aggregation is prevented by immobilizing the protein on the gel matrix, thus avoiding excessively high local concentrations (46Reischl S. Wiegert T. Schumann W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32659-32667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Considering that the carboxyl-terminal end of Crl is responsible for its ability to stimulate csgBA transcription (44Arnqvist A. Olsen A. Pfeifer J. Russell D.G. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we decided to add the His6 tag to the amino-terminal end of Crl. For σS, the His6 derivative has already been constructed by Becker et al. (43Becker G. Klauck E. Hengge-Aronis R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6439-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The His6-Crl and His6-σS fusion proteins were purified, using Ni2+-NTA technology, from crude extracts of E. coli strains M15 and FI1202, respectively. The major His6 protein fusion peaks were recovered by elution of the native proteins with 250 mm imidazole (Fig. 1A). As expected, His6-Crl (Mr, 15,5137) migrates with a relative mobility of ∼15 kDa in an SDS-PAGE gel, as does wild type Crl (data not shown). Despite the presence of minor contaminating proteins, His6-Crl and His6-σS represented about 95% of the eluted protein, as judged by Fig. 1A. The yield of His6 fusion proteins was 0.2 mg from 100 ml of induced culture. Immunoblot analysis of the eluted fraction containing His6-Crl with anti-σS polyclonal antibodies allowed us to demonstrate that σS coeluted with His6-Crl from the Ni2+ column (Fig. 1B). The interaction specificity was verified using salt gradients (data not shown). As a control, a cleared extract from the host strain that does not express the fusion protein was applied to the Ni2+-NTA-agarose matrix. Immunoblot analysis of the eluted fraction with imidazole did not revealed the presence of proteins, thus suggesting that the interaction between Crl and σS is specific. To establish that the association of these two proteins was not mediated through DNA, we repeated the purification protocol in the presence of either ethidium bromide (300 μg/ml) or micrococcal nuclease (600 units) as described (47Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 48Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Schmiesing J.A. Dong Y. Barak O.G. Speicher D.W. Yokomori K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2002; 418: 994-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The association of σS with His6-Crl was unaffected by either treatment (Fig. 1C). In order to delineate which part of σS is responsible for the interaction with Crl, we repeated the His6-Crl purification in strain MNC10, which expresses relatively high amounts of a σS mutant called σS(Δ7–35) (49Studemann A. Noirclerc-Savoye M. Klauck E. Becker G. Schneider D. Hengge R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4111-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The smaller protein σS(Δ7–35) still co-purified with His6-Crl, thus indicating that the amino-terminal region of σS is not essential for Crl binding in vitro (data not shown). The inverse protocol of using His6-σS to co-purify Crl was not possible because Crl appeared to bind non-specifically to the column. Therefore, the interaction between Crl and σS was further assessed using gel filtration. Purified proteins were applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), and column samples were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. Purified His6-σS alone, a 38-kDa protein, eluted earlier than expected (mainly in fractions 31–34), at the position predicted for a globular pr"
https://openalex.org/W1976760968,"Recently, it was proposed that neutrophils generate ozone (Wentworth, P. J., McDunn, J. E., Wentworth, A. D., Takeuchi, C., Nieva, J., Jones, T., Bautista, C., Ruedi, J. M., Gutierrez, A., Janda, K. D., Babior, B. M., Eschenmoser, A., and Lerner, R. A. (2002) Science 298, 2195–2199; Babior, B. M., Takeuchi, C., Ruedi, J., Gutierrez, A., and Wentworth, P. J. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100, 3031–3034). Evidence for the proposal was based largely on the chemistry of ozone reacting with indigo carmine to produce isatin sulfonic acid. In this investigation, we have examined the specificity of this reaction and whether it can be used as unequivocal evidence of ozone production by neutrophils. Stimulated neutrophils promoted the loss of indigo carmine and formation of isatin sulfonic acid in a reaction that was completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase. Methionine, which scavenges ozone, singlet oxygen, and hypochlorous acid, had no effect on the reaction. Neither did catalase or azide, which scavenge hydrogen peroxide and inhibit myeloperoxidase, respectively. From these results, it is apparent that superoxide was responsible for bleaching indigo carmine. Superoxide generated using xanthine oxidase and acetaldehyde also converted indigo carmine to isatin sulfonic acid in a reaction that was completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase and unaffected by catalase. When the xanthine oxidase reaction was carried out in H218O, the proportion of 18O incorporated into the isatin sulfonic acid was the same as that found for ozone. Thus, reactions of ozone and superoxide with indigo carmine are indistinguishable with respect to isatin sulfonic acid formation. We conclude that bleaching of indigo carmine cannot be used to invoke ozone production by neutrophils. Studies using indigo carmine to implicate ozone in other biological processes should also be interpreted with caution. Recently, it was proposed that neutrophils generate ozone (Wentworth, P. J., McDunn, J. E., Wentworth, A. D., Takeuchi, C., Nieva, J., Jones, T., Bautista, C., Ruedi, J. M., Gutierrez, A., Janda, K. D., Babior, B. M., Eschenmoser, A., and Lerner, R. A.

We conclude that bleaching of indigo carmine cannot be used to invoke ozone production by neutrophils. Studies using indigo carmine to implicate ozone in other biological processes should also be interpreted with caution. Neutrophils are essential for effective host defense against a wide range of bacteria and fungi (1Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 721-768Google Scholar, 2Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3007-3017Google Scholar). Although their oxidants have been intensely studied since Babior et al. (3Babior B.M. Curnutte J.T. Kipnes R.S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1975; 85: 235-244Google Scholar) found that neutrophils generate superoxide, a clear picture of how oxidants kill microorganisms has yet to emerge. Recently, it was proposed that neutrophils generate ozone and that this toxic oxidant contributes to the antimicrobial and inflammatory actions of these cells (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 2195-2199Google Scholar, 5Wentworth P.J.

Ruedi J. Gutierrez A. Wentworth P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3031-3034Google Scholar). This proposal challenges the contemporary paradigms used to explain oxidative killing of phagocytosed microorganisms. Several commentaries have been written on these findings, some proposing that the ways phagocytes employ their oxidants needs to be reevaluated (7Nathan C. Science. 2002; 298: 2143-2144Google Scholar, 8Lerner R.A. Eschenmoser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3013-3015Google Scholar) and others questioning whether this is justified on the strength of the current evidence (9Parren P.W. Leusen J.H. van de Winkel J.G. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 467-469Google Scholar). Before ozone can be accepted as an important oxidant in the antimicrobial armory of the neutrophil, the mechanism by which it is generated and the evidence to support it needs further evaluation. Wentworth et al. (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A.

Science. 2001; 293: 1806-1811Google Scholar) proposed a mechanism for ozone production, based on previous observations by this group on the antibody-catalyzed oxidation of water by singlet oxygen. It requires antibodies to be bound to the plasma membrane of the neutrophil and singlet oxygen to be generated by the cells. However, this remains speculative as it was not possible to suppress the reaction by antibody removal (6Babior B.M. Takeuchi C. Ruedi J. Gutierrez A. Wentworth P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3031-3034Google Scholar), and the amounts that could be detected were much less than those needed to kill bacteria in a cell-free singlet oxygen/antibody system (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 2195-2199Google Scholar). Whether neutrophils produce significant amounts of singlet oxygen is also debatable. Singlet oxygen can be produced by the reaction of hypochlorous acid with hydrogen peroxide (11Kanofsky J.R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1989; 70: 1-28Google Scholar), both major products of the respiratory burst of neutrophils. When these cells are stimulated, they reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide, which dismutates to hydrogen peroxide (12Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Google Scholar). The neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase uses hydrogen peroxide to oxidize chloride to hypochlorous acid (13Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Report. 1997; 3: 3-15Google Scholar). However, the reaction between hypochlorous acid and hydrogen peroxide requires an acid pH (14Kanofsky J.R. Wright J. Miles-Richardson G.E. Tauber A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1489-1495Google Scholar), in which neutrophil oxidase activity is suppressed (15Gabig T.G. Bearman S.I. Babior B.M. Blood. 1979; 53: 1133-1139Google Scholar); under physiological conditions, other reactions of hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid are much more favored (2Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3007-3017Google Scholar). With some exceptions (16Tatsuzawa H. Maruyama T. Hori K. Sano Y. Nakano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 647-650Google Scholar, 17Steinbeck M.J. Khan A.U. Karnovsky M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13425-13433Google Scholar), most studies have found low or undetectable singlet oxygen production from myeloperoxidase systems or neutrophils (1Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 721-768Google Scholar, 11Kanofsky J.R. Chem. Biol.

Invest. 1984; 74: 1489-1495Google Scholar), and the majority opinion is that it is not formed by these cells in appreciable amounts. The major evidence presented for ozone formation by neutrophils was that these cells converted indigo carmine to isatin sulfonic acid (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 2195-2199Google Scholar, 6Babior B.M. Takeuchi C. Ruedi J. Gutierrez A. Wentworth P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3031-3034Google Scholar). Ozone reacts rapidly with indigo carmine (18Munoz F. von Sonntag C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 2000; : 661-664Google Scholar). Other oxidants, including hypochlorous acid and singlet oxygen also bleach this blue dye (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 2195-2199Google Scholar, 19Harriram A. Govender V. Jonnalagadda S.B. J. Environ. Sci. Health A. 2003; 38: 1055-1064Google Scholar). However, with ozone but not the other oxidants, an atom of oxygen from water was found to be incorporated into isatin sulfonic acid (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 2195-2199Google Scholar), as in Scheme 1. As evidence of ozone formation, isotopically labeled oxygen from water was also incorporated into isatin sulfonic acid formed by neutrophils. The implications of neutrophils generating ozone are considerable. Yet a definitive mechanism for production has not been established, and alternative explanations for oxidation of the probes have not been excluded. Therefore, we have reexamined the process whereby neutrophils bleach indigo carmine. We show that superoxide can convert indigo carmine to isatin sulfonic acid and that this reaction can explain indigo carmine bleaching by neutrophils. Materials—Indigo carmine, 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) 1The abbreviations used are: PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid; SOD, superoxide dismutase; TBA, tetrabutylammoniumhydrogen sulfate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. , diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA), horse heart cytochrome c, bovine liver catalase, bovine erythrocyte Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), and buttermilk xanthine oxidase were supplied by Sigma. Isatin sulfonic acid, dl-methionine, and tetrabutylammoniumhydrogen sulfate (TBA) were purchased from Aldrich, British Drug House, and Fluka, respectively. 18O water (95%) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA. Reaction of Indigo Carmine with Stimulated Neutrophils, Xanthine Oxidase, or Ozone—Neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors by centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque, dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of contaminating red cells (20Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89Google Scholar). They were incubated at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl with 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose, and 30 μm indigo carmine. The neutrophils were warmed to 37 °C for 10 min prior to stimulation with 100 ng/ml of PMA. After an additional 20 min, they were pelleted, and supernatants were assayed by HPLC to determine the extent of oxidation of indigo carmine and identify the products of oxidation. Indigo carmine was also bleached with 46 milliunits/ml of xanthine oxidase and 10 mm acetaldehyde in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Solutions contained 20 μg/ml of catalase and 100 μm DTPA to block reactions of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. The loss of indigo carmine was monitored by following the decline in absorbance at 610 nm and by HPLC. The rate of production of superoxide by xanthine oxidase was determined by measuring cytochrome c reduction over the first minute of reaction (21Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 213-215Google Scholar). Ozonolysis was carried out by bubbling ozone through a solution of 680 μm indigo carmine in phosphate buffer until approximately one-third of the indigo carmine had decolorized. Continued ozonolysis resulted in complete loss of isatin sulfonic acid because of further reactions. Ozone was generated by passing molecular oxygen through an OL100/DS ozone generator from Yanco Industries Ltd, Burton, BC, Canada. HPLC Analysis of Indigo Carmine Reactions—Indigo carmine was separated from isatin sulfonic acid using a Waters 2690 HPLC and monitored using a Waters 996 diode array detector. Samples (50 μl) from neutrophil supernatants or the xanthine oxidase system were injected on to a Phenomonex Luna 5 μm C18 reverse-phase column (250 × 4.6 mm) and eluted isocratically with 70% 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10 mm TBA and 30% acetonitrile. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. Retention times of indigo carmine and isatin sulfonic acid were determined using authentic standards. Mass Spectral Analysis—Reactions of indigo carmine with xanthine oxidase and ozone were carried out in buffers containing at least 83% H218O as well as in normal water. Isatin sulfonic acid generated by these systems was analyzed by direct injection of 40 μl of sample into a stream of acetonitrile that flowed into a Micromass LCT time-of-flight mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source. Products were analyzed with negative ionization in the m/z range from 70 to 2500 mass units. Direct injection was necessary because initial separation by HPLC resulted in the exchange of oxygen atoms in isotopically labeled isatin sulfonic acid with water in the eluant. Neutrophils were stimulated in the presence of indigo carmine under conditions similar to those reported by Wentworth et al. (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 2195-2199Google Scholar). In agreement with their results, we found that indigo carmine was bleached with concomitant production of isatin sulfonic acid (Fig. 1). In 20 min, there was a loss of about 25 μm indigo carmine and an accumulation of a similar concentration of isatin sulfonic acid. To establish what product of neutrophils promoted formation of isatin sulfonic acid, cells were stimulated in the presence of scavengers of reactive oxygen species (Fig. 1). SOD, which scavenges superoxide, completely blocked the loss of indigo carmine and the production of isatin sulfonic acid. Methionine, which reacts rapidly with ozone (22Kanofsky J.R. Sima P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 52-62Google Scholar), singlet oxygen (23Michaeli A. Feitelson J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1994; 59: 284-289Google Scholar), and hypochlorous acid (24Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Google Scholar) had no effect on either the loss of indigo carmine or the formation of isatin sulfonic acid. Catalase, which degrades hydrogen peroxide, and azide, an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase, were also without effect. From these results, it is apparent that superoxide was responsible for converting indigo carmine to isatin sulfonic acid. From the inhibitor studies, no contribution by ozone, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, or hypochlorous acid was evident. To test whether superoxide can react directly with indigo carmine, we generated it using xanthine oxidase and acetaldehyde. The rate of superoxide generation was chosen to match that of neutrophils under the conditions described in Fig. 1. Catalase was included to prevent reactions of hydrogen peroxide and the metal chelating agent DTPA from stopping production of hydroxyl radical. The xanthine oxidase system slowly bleached indigo carmine (Fig. 2A). Isatin sulfonic acid was the major product formed, as identified by its HPLC retention time (Fig. 2B) and its UV absorbance spectrum (λmax = 245 and 298 nm). Superoxide dismutase prevented indigo carmine loss (Fig. 2A) and inhibited isatin sulfonic acid production by 96% (Fig. 2, B and C). The yield of isatin sulfonic acid (9.2 μm) was 31% of the theoretical maximum, if one molecule of indigo carmine gives two molecules of isatin sulfonic acid. This yield is similar to what was obtained with neutrophils (Fig. 1). The maximum concentration of superoxide that could have been generated during the 10 min of the reaction was 290 μm. It could have been less because of oxygen depletion in the buffer but, regardless, less than 5% of the superoxide reacted to produce isatin sulfonic acid. These results indicate that superoxide reacts slowly with indigo carmine and converts it to isatin sulfonic acid. The neutrophil oxidant responsible for bleaching indigo carmine was found to react in an analogous way to authentic ozone by incorporating one atom of oxygen from water into isatin sulfonic acid (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 2195-2199Google Scholar). To determine whether this also occurs with superoxide, indigo carmine was reacted with either the xanthine oxidase system or ozone in H218O. Initial studies were performed in normal water to establish that both systems produce isatin sulfonic acid with the predicted m/z of 226 mass units when analyzed in the negative ion mode (Fig. 3, B and D). In H218O, isatin sulfonic acid would be expected to be present predominantly with m/z of 228 because of reversible exchange of its carbonyl oxygen with water. Incorporation of 18O into the amide carbonyl because of involvement of water in the oxidation process (see Scheme 1) would give an additional product with m/z of 230. When indigo carmine was reacted with superoxide (Fig. 3A) or subjected to ozonolysis (Fig. 3C) in H218O, mass analysis revealed products with m/z ratios of 228 and 230 in equal abundance. These results demonstrate that superoxide and ozone leave the same chemical signature when they react with indigo carmine. Much of the evidence for the proposal that neutrophils produce ozone comes from studies with indigo carmine (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 2195-2199Google Scholar, 6Babior B.M. Takeuchi C. Ruedi J. Gutierrez A. Wentworth P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3031-3034Google Scholar). We have investigated further the conversion of indigo carmine to isatin sulfonic acid by neutrophils and present strong evidence that superoxide is responsible for the reaction. We found that it was completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase but unaffected by agents that could either block production of ozone or scavenge it directly. Furthermore, superoxide generated by xanthine oxidase also reacted with indigo carmine to give a similar yield of isatin sulfonic acid as with neutrophils and the same oxygen incorporation from water as with ozone. Consequently, the bleaching of indigo carmine by neutrophils cannot be used to support the proposal that these cells produce ozone. Superoxide was discounted previously as the species responsible for indigo carmine bleaching by neutrophils because a 10 mm bolus addition of potassium superoxide did not produce isatin sulfonic acid (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 2195-2199Google Scholar). We investigated this reaction and also found that, although the indigo carmine was completely bleached, isatin sulfonic acid was not detectable (results not shown). However, a bolus of potassium superoxide would disappear by dismutation with a half-life of less than a second at neutral pH, and formation of isatin sulfonic acid may be inefficient under these conditions. By using xanthine oxidase to mimic the prolonged generation of superoxide by neutrophils over a longer time, oxidation of indigo carmine was analogous to that with neutrophils. The mechanism initially proposed for bleaching of indigo carmine by neutrophils involves antibody-catalyzed oxidation of water by singlet oxygen. However, as discussed in the introductory paragraphs of this paper, it is debatable whether there is sufficient antibody bound to the cells or singlet oxygen produced to support this mechanism. A direct reaction of superoxide is sufficient to explain isatin sulfonic acid formation without requiring either antibodies or singlet oxygen. A possible mechanism for the reaction with superoxide is given in Scheme 2. It involves one-electron reduction of indigo carmine to a radical that reacts with another superoxide to form an organic peroxide. The peroxide could then break down via hydrolysis and liberate isatin sulfonic acid as well as dioxindole sulfonate. The dioxindole sulfonate would contain an atom of oxygen originally from water and would auto-oxidize to isatin sulfonic acid. In support of this mechanism, indigo carmine readily undergoes two-electron reduction to its leuco-form (E′o = -125 mV; Refs. 25Clark W.M. Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. Waverly Press, Baltimore1960Google Scholar, 26Cook A.G. Tolliver R.M. Williams J.E. J. Chem. Ed. 2003; 71: 160-161Google Scholar). One-electron reduction of indigo carmine (E′o = -247 mV; Ref. 27Preisler P.W. Hill E.S. Loeffel R.G. Shaffer P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar) by superoxide (E′o = -330 mV; Ref. 28Ilan Y.A. Czapski G. Meisel D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 430: 209-225Google Scholar) is thermodynamically likely and is analogous to the reduction of quinones to semiquinones by superoxide (29Brunmark A. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 435-477Google Scholar). Based on the one- and two-electron reduction potentials for indigo carmine, the one-electron reduction potential for its radical anion should be about 0 mV. Hence, it should react even more favorably with a second molecule of superoxide. Formation of the organic peroxide is akin to reactions of phenoxyl radicals with superoxide (30Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 729-736Google Scholar), which occur at almost diffusioncontrolled rates (31d'Allesandro N. Bianchi G. Fang X. Jin F. Schuchmann H.-P. von Sonntag C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 2000; : 1862-1867Google Scholar). Wentworth et al. (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T.

A. 2003; 100: 3031-3034Google Scholar) also showed that both ozone and neutrophils converted vinylbenzoate to 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and used this as supporting evidence for ozone production by neutrophils. However, it is well established that myeloperoxidase oxidizes styrene derivatives such as vinylbenzoate to benzaldehydes (32Tuynman A. Spelberg J.L. Kooter I.M. Schoemaker H.E. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3025-3030Google Scholar). Therefore, an alternative explanation for the production of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde by neutrophils is that it occurred by a myeloperoxidase-dependent process. Our findings have ramifications for other biological systems where ozone production is proposed. Much of the evidence that ozone is formed when antibodies catalyze oxidation of water by singlet oxygen comes from studies of indigo carmine oxidation (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D.

From the work presented here, the species responsible could be either ozone or superoxide. Also, formation of isatin sulfonic acid in the inflammatory Arthus reaction (4Wentworth P.J. McDunn J.E.

Sci. 2000; 21: 119-120Google Scholar). More direct and specific methods for detection of ozone will be needed to establish whether this gas is produced in biological systems."

Several T-box genes are expressed in the heart and are regulators of cardiac development. At the earliest stages of heart development, two of these genes, Tbx5 and Tbx20, are co-expressed in the heart-forming region but then become differentially expressed as heart morphogenesis progresses. Although Tbx5 and Tbx20 belong to the same gene family and share a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, their transcriptional activities are distinct. The C-terminal region of the Tbx5 protein is a transcriptional activator, while the C terminus of Tbx20 can repress transcription. Tbx5, but not Tbx20, activates a cardiac-specific promoter (atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)) alone and synergistically with other transcription factors. In contrast, Tbx20 represses ANF promoter activity and also inhibits the activation mediated by Tbx5. Of the two T-box binding consensus sequences in the promoter of ANF, only T-box binding element 1 (TBE1) is required for the synergistic activation of ANF by Tbx5 and GATA4, but TBE2 is required for repression by Tbx20. To elucidate upstream signaling pathways that regulate Tbx5 and Tbx20 expression, recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 was added to cardiogenic explants from chick embryos. Using real time reverse transcription-PCR, it was demonstrated that Tbx20, but not Tbx5, is induced by bone morphogenetic protein-2. Collectively these data demonstrate clear differences in both the expression and function of two related transcription factors and suggest that the modulation of cardiac gene expression can occur as a result of combinatorial regulatory interactions of T-box proteins.

The role of T-box genes in heart development is supported by the cardiac expression of several T-box genes during cardiogenesis including Tbx5 and Tbx20 as well as Tbx1, Tbx2, and Tbx18 (6Papaioannou V.E.

Although Tbx5 and Tbx20 are differentially expressed, it has yet to be determined that they differ in their regulatory functions in the development of the heart. Many recent studies have focused on the function of Tbx5 because of its association with Holt-Oram syndrome (3Li Q.Y. Newbury-Ecob R.A. Terrett J.A. Wilson D.I. Curtis A.R. Yi C.H. Gebuhr T.

Tbx5 is required for the normal development of the heart as homozygous null tbx5 mice have hypoplastic atria and consequently do not survive past E10.5 (13Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P.

Mice heterozygous for the null tbx5 allele phenocopy some cardiac abnormalities of Holt-Oram syndrome in humans, including atrial septal defects as well as first and second degree atrioventricular block (13Bruneau B.G.

The importance of tbx20 for heart development is supported by studies in zebrafish embryos where reduced tbx20 expression results in abnormal heart morphogenesis (14Szeto D.P. Griffin K.J. Kimelman D. Development. 2002; 129: 5093-5101Google Scholar). Despite the requirement of Tbx5 and Tbx20 for normal heart development, limited information is available regarding their specific transcriptional functions during cardiogenesis.

Tbx20 contains multiple transcriptional regulatory domains (19Stennard F.A. Costa M.W. Elliott D.A. Rankin S. Haast S.J. Lai D. McDonald L.P. Niederreither K. Dolle P. Bruneau B.G. Zorn A.M. Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 206-224Google Scholar), but its role as an activator or repressor of cardiac gene expression has not been clearly defined. To better understand the transcriptional regulatory functions of Tbx5 and Tbx20, their expression and function were evaluated simultaneously. Expression of Tbx5 and Tbx20 was examined in chick embryos to define their respective expression domains during cardiac development. The differential expression of Tbx5 and Tbx20 in the heart suggests that they have distinct regulatory roles in chamber formation. Reporter gene analysis performed using sequence from the ANF promoter demonstrated that Tbx5 and Tbx20 exhibit differential transcriptional regulatory functions. Additionally it was shown that the C termini of Tbx5 and Tbx20 have functionally distinct transcriptional regulatory domains. Relatively little is known about the pathways responsible for regulating expression of Tbx5 and Tbx20 during initial stages of cardiogenesis. In explanted cardiogenic regions from chicken embryos, Tbx20 but not Tbx5 expression was induced by bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) treatment. Collectively these studies define distinct expression, transcriptional function, and regulation of the related transcription factors Tbx5 and Tbx20 during heart development. In Situ Hybridization—Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs (Spafas Inc., Roanoke, IL) were incubated at 38 °C under high humidity, and embryos were collected at 1, 2, 5, and 10 days. Whole embryos or dissected hearts were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed embryos and hearts were dehydrated in a graded methanol, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 series and stored at -20 °C in 100% methanol. Whole mount in situ hybridizations were performed as described by Wilkinson (20Wilkinson D.G. Stern C.D. Holland P.W.H. Essential Developmental Biology.

The pAC-CMV-Tbx5(R237Q) and pAC-CMVTbx5(R279ter) expression plasmids were generated by performing site-directed mutagenesis (see below) on the pBluescript-SK-Tbx5 plasmid followed by insertion into the BamHI site of the CMVpLpA(5)+ plasmid. The mouse tbx20 sequence was isolated from E10.5 ventricle RNA by RT-PCR using the following primers: 5′-CCCAGTTCCGCTTTGCTTGCTCTC-3′ and 5′-CCCCACTTCCCACCCACCCTACTT-3′. The ∼1500-base pair sequence, corresponding to GenBank™ accession number AF30667 (23Kraus F. Haenig B. Kispert A. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 87-91Google Scholar), was subcloned into pBluescript-SK.

The pMT2-GATA4 and pEMSV-Nkx2.5 expression plasmids were provided by J. Molkentin. Transient Transfections and Reporter Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were co-transfected with 100-500 ng of each expression vector, unless specified otherwise, and 500 ng of the reporter plasmid using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Each co-transfection also included 100 ng of CMV-LacZ, and the DNA concentrations were kept constant by the addition of empty expression vectors. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Tropix). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay kit (Tropix) and Galacto-Star reagents (Tropix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reporter activity was detected using a Monolight 3010 luminometer, and luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was completed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Statistical significance of observed differences was determined by Student's t test. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Nucleotide changes were generated using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. To generate mutations in T-box binding element 1 (TBE1) and TBE2 of the (-288)ANF-luciferase reporter, the following primers were used in the initial PCR: mutTBE2, 5′-CTTTTCTGCTCTTCTCTTTGCTTTGAAGTGGGGGCCTCTTGAGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTCAAGAGGCCCCCACTTCAAAGCAAAGAGAAGAGCAGAAAAG-3′; mutTBE1, 5′-ATCTTCTCCTGGCCGCCGCAACAAGCAGAATGGGGAGGGTTCCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGAACCCTCCCCATTCTGCTTGTTGCGGCGGCCAGGAGAAGAT-3′ (16 cycles of 95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 1 min; 68 °C, 7 min). Nucleotide changes in tbx5 to create Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) mutations were generated using the pBlueScript-SK-Tbx5 as template and the following primers: R237Q, 5′-CCCTTCGCCAAAGGCTTTCAGGGCAGTGATGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCATCACTGCCCTGAAAGCCTTTGGCGAAGGG-3′; R279ter, 5′-CTTCAGCAGCGAGACCTGAGCTCTCTCCACCTC3′ and 5′-GAGGTGGAGAGAGCTCAGGTCTCGCTGCTGAAG-3′. Sequence analysis confirmed that the plasmids contained the intended nucleotide changes. Chicken Explant Cultures and Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Mesendodermal tissue from Hamburger-Hamilton stage 5 chick embryos was explanted as described previously (32Searcy R.D. Yutzey K.E. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 82-91Google Scholar, 33Yutzey K. Gannon M. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 531-541Google Scholar) and cultured for 6 h in M199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin with or without the addition of 200 ng/ml recombinant BMP2 (R&D Systems). The lateral heart-forming regions explanted were defined previously (21Ehrman L.A. Yutzey K.E. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 163-175Google Scholar). RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and pooled from lateral or medial explants of four embryos (32Searcy R.D. Yutzey K.E. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 82-91Google Scholar). cDNA was generated with oligo(dT) primers and the SuperScript first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using the MJ Research Opticon Monitor II system (94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1.5 min; 72 °C, 3 min; 35 cycles). Reactions included 0.1× SYBR Green (Molecular Probes), and fluorescence was monitored at 72 °C. The following primers were used in the RT-PCR: Tbx5, 5′-GGGCTCCCAGTACCAGTGTGA-3′ and 5′-GTAGGGCTTCTTGTAGGGATG-3′; Tbx20, 5′-TTGGCATGTGGAAAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CAGGCAACGCAAAGCAGAG-3′; Nkx2.5 and GAPDH primers were reported previously (34Schultheiss T.M. Xydas S. Lassar A.B. Development. 1995; 121: 4203-4214Google Scholar). Gene expression levels were quantified based on the threshold cycle (C(t)) calibrated to a standard curve generated using E7 chicken whole heart cDNA and normalized to GAPDH as described by the manufacturer (MJ Research). RT-PCR results were compiled from seven independent experiments with PCRs performed two to three times in triplicate. Statistical significance of observed differences was determined using Student's t test. Tbx5 and Tbx20 Are Differentially Expressed in the Developing Chicken Heart—To compare the temporal and spatial regulation of Tbx5 and Tbx20 mRNA expression in the heart, in situ hybridization was performed on chicken embryos and isolated hearts from 1-10 days of development (Fig. 1). Expression of both Tbx5 and Tbx20 is detected in the heart primordia of Hamburger-Hamilton stage 6 embryos (Fig. 1, A and B, black arrowheads). At this stage, Tbx5 is expressed at low levels in the anterior heart-forming region, whereas Tbx20 expression is apparent in the anterior heart-forming region and in the posterior lateral regions of the embryo (Fig. 1B, red arrowheads). By stage 8, Tbx5 and Tbx20 are co-expressed in the cardiac primordia immediately prior to cardiomyocyte differentiation and heart tube formation (Fig. 1, C and D, black arrowheads). Concurrently the posterior lateral expression of Tbx20 is reduced, and expression becomes restricted to the cardiac primordia. At later stages, Tbx5 and Tbx20 are differentially expressed in the primitive heart tube and during heart chamber morphogenesis. In stage 12 embryos, Tbx5 expression becomes restricted to the posterior, atrial, and left ventricular regions of the heart tube (Fig. 1E, red arrowhead), while Tbx20 is expressed throughout the entire heart tube including the anterior outflow tract (Fig. 1F, red arrowhead). Although Tbx5 and Tbx20 are co-expressed in the atria at E5 (Fig. 1, G and H, black arrowheads), their expression in the atrioventricular canal (AVC), ventricles, and outflow tract are distinct. Tbx5 is present in the atria and left ventricle but is not expressed in the right ventricle and outflow tract. Tbx20 expression, however, is enriched in the AVC, the outflow tract (Fig. 1H, red arrowheads), and right ventricle but is reduced in the left ventricle. Interestingly the expression of Tbx5 and Tbx20 in the ventricles are complementary with sharp boundaries of expression where the ventricular septum will form (Fig. 1, G and H, blue arrowheads). After 10 days of development, Tbx5 is strongly expressed in the atria (Fig. 1I, black arrowhead) and in the developing conduction system (Fig. 1I, red arrowhead). Tbx20 expression is present in the atria (Fig. 1J, black arrowhead), the AVC, and specifically in the tricuspid and mitral valves (Fig. 1J, black arrows). These data show that Tbx5 and Tbx20 share a similar expression pattern in the early heart primordia and developing atria. However, Tbx5 and Tbx20 are differentially expressed in the atrioventricular valves and specialized myocardial lineages. The C Termini of Tbx5 and Tbx20 Have Distinct Transcriptional Regulatory Functions—Differential expression of Tbx5 and Tbx20 may be related to diverse functions in the development of the heart. Although homologous in the T-box DNA binding region (63.0% identity), Tbx5 and Tbx20 share no obvious homology outside of this domain (15.1% identity in the N terminus and 10.1% in the C terminus). To determine the transcriptional regulatory functions of their divergent domains, fusion proteins were generated containing the C terminus of either Tbx5 or Tbx20 and the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The amino acids used in the fusion proteins relative to the T-box region are shown in Fig. 2A. The Gal4-Tbx5 fusion protein contains amino acids 266-518 of Tbx5, and the Gal4-Tbx20 fusion protein contains amino acids 294-445 of Tbx20. These fusion constructs were co-transfected into NIH 3T3 cells with the G5E1b-luciferase reporter gene that contains five sequential Gal4 binding sites linked to the E1b promoter (29Huang J. Weintraub H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5478-5484Google Scholar). Co-transfection of the G5E1b-luciferase reporter with Gal4-Tbx5-(266-518) led to a more than 250-fold increase in expression relative to the reporter co-transfected with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain alone (Fig. 2B). In contrast, co-transfection with Gal4-Tbx20-(294-445) resulted in a significant decrease in the level of reporter activity relative to that observed with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain alone (Fig. 2B). Additional evidence for the repressor activity of Tbx20 was provided by co-transfection of Gal4-Tbx20-(294-445) with a reporter gene containing five sequential Gal4 and two LexA binding sites (5xGal4-2xLexA-E1B-luc) (35Zhou X. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Google Scholar). This reporter allows repressor activity of Gal4-Tbx20-(294-445) to be assessed by the ability to reduce the activation mediated by a strong activator. The 5xGal4-2xLexA-E1B-luc reporter was co-transfected with the Gal4-Tbx20-(294-445) and a fusion construct containing the LexA DNA-binding domain fused to VP16. Co-transfection of Gal4-Tbx20-(294-445) significantly decreased the high reporter activity mediated by the LexA-VP16 construct (Fig. 2C). These data provide additional evidence that the C terminus of the Tbx20 protein contains a transcriptional repressor domain. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the C terminus of Tbx5 acts as an activator, while the C terminus of Tbx20 acts as a repressor. Tbx20 Antagonizes Tbx5 Activation of ANF Reporter Gene Expression—The relative abilities of Tbx5 and Tbx20 to activate cardiac gene expression was assessed using a reporter gene consisting of the proximal 3003 base pairs of the rat ANF promoter linked to the luciferase gene ((-3003)ANF-luciferase) (25Argentin S.

The ANF promoter contains the consensus binding sequences of several cardiac transcription factors and has been extensively used to examine cardiac gene-regulatory mechanisms (13Bruneau B.G. Nemer G.

NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with the (-3003)ANF-luciferase reporter and with pAC-CMVTbx5 or pAC-CMV-Tbx20 expression plasmids, and ANF transcriptional activation was assessed 48 h later. (-3003)ANF-luciferase expression significantly increased ∼2.3-fold compared with the empty vector control when co-transfected with Tbx5. ANF reporter activity, however, was significantly decreased (∼30%) when co-transfected with Tbx20 compared with the empty vector control (Fig. 3A). To determine whether Tbx20 can antagonize Tbx5 function, (-3003)ANF-luciferase was co-transfected with increasing amounts of pAC-CMVTbx20 (0.1-1.5 μg) and a constant amount of pAC-CMV-Tbx5 (0.5 μg). Tbx5 activation of (-3003)ANF-luciferase expression decreased as the quantity of Tbx20 expression plasmid transfected increased and was completely abrogated by the maximal transfected ratio (1.5:0.5 μg) of Tbx20:Tbx5 (Fig. 3A). Together these results indicate that Tbx20 alone can repress ANF promoter activity and also is able to inhibit the ability of Tbx5 to activate ANF gene expression. Tbx5, but Not Tbx20, Cooperatively Acts with GATA4 and Nkx2.5 to Activate ANF Expression—The ability of Tbx5 or Tbx20 to cooperate with GATA4 and Nkx2.5 in activating (-3003)ANF-luciferase was determined in transfected NIH 3T3 cells. pAC-CMV-Tbx5 and pAC-CMV-Tbx20 were co-transfected with either pMT2-GATA4 or pEMSV-Nkx2.5 expression plasmids and the (-3003)ANF-luciferase reporter. Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and GATA4 each activated (-3003)ANF-luciferase expression (∼1.9-, ∼7.4-, and ∼4.1-fold, respectively) (Fig. 3B). A synergistic activation of (-3003)ANF-luciferase was observed when Tbx5 was co-transfected with Nkx2.5 (∼28.0-fold) (Fig. 3B). However, when Tbx20 was co-transfected with Nkx2.5, this synergistic activation was not observed, and the level of (-3003)ANF-luciferase activation was comparable to that of Nkx2.5 alone (∼7.0-fold) (Fig. 3B). Synergistic activation of (-3003)ANF-luciferase was also observed when Tbx5 was co-transfected with GATA4 (∼36.5-fold); however, this synergy was not achieved with Tbx20 and GATA4 together (∼5.4-fold) (Fig. 3B).

A biochemical cascade named spindle checkpoint ensures the spatial and temporal order of chromosome segregation during mitosis. Here we report that spindle checkpoint protein MAD1 interacts with NEK2A, a human orthologue of the Aspergillus nidulans NIMA kinase. MAD1 interacts with NEK2A in vitro and in vivo via a leucine zipper-containing domain located at the C terminus of MAD1. Like MAD1, NEK2A is localized to HeLa cell kinetochore of mitotic cells. Elimination of NEK2A by small interfering RNA does not arrest cells in mitosis but causes aberrant premature chromosome segregation. NEK2A is required for MAD2 but not MAD1, BUB1, and HEC1 to associate with kinetochores. These NEK2A-eliminated or -suppressed cells display a chromosome bridge phenotype with sister chromatid inter-connected. Moreover, loss of NEK2A impairs mitotic checkpoint signaling in response to spindle damage by nocodazole, which affected mitotic escape and led to generation of cells with multiple nuclei. Our data demonstrate that NEK2A is a kinetochore-associated protein kinase essential for faithful chromosome segregation.

We hypothesize that NEK2A links MAD2 molecular dynamics to spindle checkpoint signaling. Chromosome movements during mitosis are governed by the interaction of spindle microtubules with a specialized chromosome domain located within the centromere. This specialized region, called the kinetochore (1Brinkley B.R. Stubblefield E. Chromosoma. 1966; 19: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2Roos U.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 54: 363-385Google Scholar), is the site for spindle microtubule-centromere association. In addition to providing a physical link between chromosomes and spindle microtubules, the kinetochore has an active function in chromosomal segregation through microtubule motors and spindle checkpoint sensors located at or near it (3Nicklas R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2245-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4Rieder C.L. Alexander S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 5Yao X. Abrieu A.

Cell. 1991; 66: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have implicated the kinetochore in generation of a diffusible checkpoint signal that can block cell cycle progression into anaphase until all kinetochores have successfully attached to spindle microtubules. Delayed attachment of one or more chromosomes to the spindle is correlated with a corresponding delay in the onset of anaphase. For mutants that fail to arrest the cell cycle in mitosis after disassembly of microtubules in budding yeast, genetic screen has identified three MAD (mitotic arrest deficiency) and three BUB (budding uninhibited by benomyl) genes (7Hoyt M.A. Totis L. Roberts B.T.S. Cell. 1990; 66: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Vertebrate homologues of MAD1 (8Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T.

Expression of the kinetochore binding domain of murine BUB1 (13Taylor S.S. McKeon F.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 941-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) results in premature onset of anaphase, presumably by replacement of the endogenous proteins at kinetochores. Collectively, these data indicate that binding of these spindle checkpoint components at the kinetochores may generate a signal in response to spindle defects and/or aberrant kinetochore protein-protein interactions. Mitosis is orchestrated by signaling cascades that coordinate mitotic processes and ensure accurate chromosome segregation. The key switch for the onset of mitosis is the archetypal cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2. Besides the master mitotic kinase Cdc2, there are three protein serine/threonine kinase families as follows: the Polo kinases, Aurora kinases, and the NEK (NIMA-related kinases) (16Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 17O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The latter family has proven the most enigmatic in function, although recent advances from several sources are beginning to reveal a common functional theme. NIMA (never in mitosis A) is vital in Aspergillus nidulans for entry into mitosis (17O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Oakley B.R. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mutation of NIMA arrests cells in G2 without interfering with p34cdc2 activation, suggesting that the NIMA protein has a central role in the G2/M transition. Moreover, if the G2 arrest of nimA mutants is bypassed by additional mutations, the resulting mitotic cells show aberrant spindle and nuclear envelope organization (17O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Oakley B.R. Morris N.R. J.

Cell. 1995; 81: 413-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), pointing to functions of NIMA beyond the control of mitotic entry. NEK2A, the homologue in human cells with the greatest structural similarity to NIMA within the catalytic domain, is regulated in yeast in a manner similar to regulation of NIMA in A. nidulans; its expression and serine/threonine kinase activity is highest during late G2 phase, when NEK2A is expected to function critically (20Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a portion of NEK2A localizes to centrosomes and in mammalian cells appears to play a role similar to NIMA in controlling entry into mitosis (16Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 17O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). NEK2A may have more diverse roles during several phases of the cell cycle, from S phase to multiple phases of mitosis, based on its dynamic expression and subcellular localization in cytosol, nucleus, and chromosome portions other than the centrosome (16Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 17O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49408-49416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed that NEK2A is associated with centromere (17O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it was not clear whether NEK2A is indeed localized to the kinetochore and whether NEK2A functions during chromosome movements in mitosis. The mitotic spindle checkpoint is a chromosome segregation surveillance mechanism that prevents chromosome from premature segregation in the presence of mis-aligned chromosomes. This surveillance system is highly sensitive as a single unaligned chromosome or perturbation of kinetochore protein interactions is sufficient to block the transit of cells from metaphase to anaphase (22Li X. Nicklas R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 537-545PubMed Google Scholar). The initial description of the mitotic checkpoint in yeast defined a nonessential pathway invoked only in response to spindle damage. But in metazoans, the checkpoint has evolved into an essential feature of normal mitoses and meioses (23Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 997-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Microinjection of antibodies to MAD2 into cultured animal cells first revealed premature anaphase onset and chromosome mis-segregation (24Gorbsky G.J. Chen R.H. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1193-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the spindle checkpoint depends on a tight complex between the MAD1 and MAD2 proteins (25Chen R.H. Brady D.M. Smith D. Murray A.W. Hardwick K.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2607-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although MAD1 is required for MAD2 localization to the kinetochore (25Chen R.H. Brady D.M. Smith D. Murray A.W. Hardwick K.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2607-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it is unknown how MAD1 function is integrated into the mitotic regulation. To explore the nature of MAD1 function in mitotic spindle checkpoint signaling, we carried out yeast genetic screening and identified the novel MAD1-interacting partner NEK2A. Our studies show that NEK2A interacts with MAD1 via the leucine zipper motif on the MAD1 molecule. In addition, we show that both NEK2A and MAD1 are co-localized to the kinetochore of mitotic cells. Given the involvement of MAD1 in spindle checkpoint surveillance and novel function of NEK2A revealed in this study, we proposed that NEK2A links mitotic checkpoint signaling to chromosome segregation dynamics. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Full-length human MAD1 cDNA, a gift from Dr. Dong-Yan Jin (University of Hong Kong), was employed to screen a HeLa cDNA library made in fusion with the GAL4 activation domain in the vector pGBD-T7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by using yeast strain AH109 containing the reporter genes his3 and lacZ. About 1 million co-transformants were screened for the two reporter genes on the plates containing media with amino acid selection. To map the region(s) of MAD1, which interact with NEK2A, four deletion mutants of MAD1 were selected based on the secondary structure prediction (cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/). MAD1 bait deletion constructs were PCR-amplified and obtained by digestion of the bait with BamHI and EcoRI followed by gel purification of respective bands and sub-cloning into pGBD-T7 vector. In addition, six deletion mutants of NEK2A were selected to map the interface(s) between NEK2A and MAD1. NEK2A deletion constructs were generated by digesting the prey with BamHI and XhoI followed by the gel purification of respective bands and then sub-cloning into pGADT7 vector. cDNA Construction—Total RNAs, isolated from HeLa cells by using standard protocol, were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) for 15 min at room temperature before addition of 25 mm EDTA and were heated to 65 °C for 10 min to stop the reaction. DNase I-treated RNAs were reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 50 min using oligo(dT) and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase RNase H (Promega, Madison, WI). By using this cDNA as template, PCR was performed with related primer. The resulting fragment was cloned into TA cloning vector (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) and completely sequenced. For mammalian expression of the full-length NEK2A, NEK2A cDNA was digested with SalI and BamHI and cloned into pEGFP C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), whereas the full length of MAD1 cDNA was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into pEGFP C2 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant Protein Production—NEK2A, MAD1, and their fragments were expressed in bacteria as fusion proteins. Briefly, the full length of MAD1 cDNA was cloned into pMal C2 vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), whereas a BamHI/EcoRI fragment (amino acids 480–680) was cloned into pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). The partial cDNA sequence of NEK2A (amino acids 305–446) was obtained from yeast screen. After digestion with NotI and SalI, it was fused in-frame with His6 at the C terminus (pET22b; Novagen) and GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RNAi, RNA interference; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ACA, anti-centromere antibody. at the N terminus (pGEX-5X-3), respectively. Purification of recombinant proteins was carried out as described previously (26Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 liter of LB media was inoculated with bacteria transformed either with NEK2A or MAD1. The expression of protein was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 3 h after the induction, re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing proteinase inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin; 5 μg/ml), and sonicated for four bursts of 10 s each by using a probe-tip sonicator. The lysis solution was clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The soluble fraction was applied to a column packed with glutathione-agarose beads, followed by extensive washes with PBS. Affinity Precipitation of MAD1 and NEK2A—His-tagged NEK2A-transformed bacterial cell lysate was used as a source of NEK2A protein. The purified soluble GST-fused MAD1-(380–680) protein was pre-bound to glutathione-agarose (Sigma). GST-MAD1-(380–680) bound beads were washed with 5× column volume using wash buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and equilibrated with 10× column volume of incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The purified His-fused NEK2A-(305–446), re-suspended in incubation buffer, was loaded on the column and incubated for 1 h, and the flow-through fraction was collected. The column was washed with 10× volume of incubation buffer, and wash fraction was collected. Finally, the column was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and elution fraction was collected. Non-bound glutathione-agarose beads and GST protein-bound glutathione-agarose beads were used as negative control. All collected fractions were resolved on SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using GST mouse antibody (NeoMarkers). Transient Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—293T cells were grown to ∼50% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 10% CO2 and were co-transfected with GFP-NEK2A and FLAG-MAD1 by GeneJammer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were collected 24–36 h after transfection, and proteins were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 g/ml leupeptin, and 10 g/ml pepstatin A). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. GFP-tagged fusion proteins were incubated with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody bound to protein-A/G beads (Pierce). Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and then boiled in protein sample buffer for 2 min. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was divided into three strips and probed with antibodies against the GFP epitope, MAD1, and tubulin, respectively. Immunoreactive signals were detected with ECL kit (Pierce) and visualized by autoradiography on Kodak BioMax film. siRNA Treatment and Assay for Knock-down Efficiency—The siRNA sequence used for silencing of NEK2A corresponds to the coding region 260–280 (relative to the start codon). As a control, either a duplex targeting cyclophilin or scramble sequence was used (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The 21-mer oligonucleotide RNA duplexes were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO). In the trial experiments, different concentrations of siRNA oligonucleotides were used for different time intervals of treatment as detailed previously (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa cells were synchronized and transfected with 21-mer siRNA oligonucleotides or control scramble oligonucleotide, whereas the efficiency of the siRNA oligonucleotide on NEK2A protein knock-down was judged by Western blotting analysis (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence, cells were seeded onto sterile, acid-treated 18-mm coverslips in 6-well plates (Corning Glass). Double thymidine-blocked and -released HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg/ml LipofectAMINE 2000 pre-mixed with various siRNA oligonucleotides as described above. In general, 36 h after transfection with siRNA or scrambled (control) oligonucleotides, HeLa cells were rinsed for 1 min with PHEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 4 m glycerol) and were permeabilized for 2 min with PHEM plus 0.2% Triton X-100 as described previously (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 27Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Extracted cells were then fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.05% glutaraldehyde in PHEM and rinsed three times in PBS. Cells on the coverslips were blocked with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (TPBS) with 1% BSA (Sigma). These cells were incubated with various primary antibodies in a humidified chamber for 1 h and then washed three times in TPBS. Monoclonal antibodies bound to MAD1, HEC1, and NEK2A were visualized using fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG), respectively, whereas binding of anti-centromere antibody was visualized using Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-human IgG + IgM. DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma), and MAD2 was labeled with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody as described previously (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Slides were examined with a Zeiss Axiovert-200 fluorescence microscope, and images were collected and analyzed with Image-5 (Carl Zeiss, Germany). In some cases, aliquots of oligonucleotide-treated HeLa cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml nocodazole for a period of 18 h to determine whether elimination of NEK2A abrogates the mitotic spindle checkpoint. These cells were then fixed and stained with DAPI for scoring the cell fate profiling under microscope. Far Western Assay—The purified soluble GST-fused MAD1-(380–680) was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 2% BSA in PBS containing Tween 20 and incubated with ∼10 μg of His-tagged NEK2A-(305–446) as a probe and BSA as a control. After a 2-h incubation, the membrane was washed four times with PBS and incubated with histidine antibody (Cell Signaling Co.) for 1 h. Horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used to detect primary antibody, and the blot was developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and 293T cells, from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were maintained as subcon-fluent monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, UT) and 100 units/ml penicillin plus 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). In some cases, thymidine-blocked and -released HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg/ml LipofectAMINE 2000 pre-mixed with 2 μg/ml cDNA plasmid encoding GFP and GFP-NEK2A-KD (kinase-death mutant K37R), respectively, as described (28Zhang J. Fu C. Miao Y. Duo Z. Yao X. Sci. Bull. 2002; 119: 345-353Google Scholar). In general, 36 h after transfection, HeLa cells were pre-extracted with PHEM plus 0.2% Triton X-100 followed by fixation and immunocytochemistry as described above. Western Blot—Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6–16% gradient gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were probed by appropriate primary and secondary antibodies and detected using ECL (Pierce). The band intensity was then scanned using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). NEK2A Is a Novel Interactor for MAD1—To identify proteins that associate with MAD1, the full length of MAD1 cDNA was used as bait to screen a HeLa cDNA library by using GAL4 yeast two-hybrid system. Screening was performed on a total 1 × 105 clones with 31 positive clones. Following analysis by restriction digests of HaeIII and AluI, we got several novel interacting partners of MAD1. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that one of these interactors encodes the C terminus of NEK2A (amino acids from 305 to 446). Its sequence matches human NEK2A (GenBank™ accession number XM001878). To verify the specificity of interaction between NEK2A and MAD1 and to define further the domain(s) that mediates the interaction between MAD1 and NEK2A, we took advantage of yeast genetics and sought to perform additional yeast two-hybrid screens to map the binding interface(s) between NEK2A and MAD1. To this end, we used reverse transcriptase-PCR to obtain the full-length cDNA of NEK2A from a HeLa cell library, and we cloned it into pGAD T7 vector. To define better the domain responsible for the specific interaction between MAD1 and NEK2A, we employed a two-dimensional structure prediction analysis to search for protein-protein interaction modules in the two proteins. We found that both proteins contained a leucine zipper motif. The leucine zipper of MAD1 is located between amino acids 500 and 522, and the leucine zipper of NEK2A is located between amino acids 306 and 328. Since leucine zipper mediates protein-protein interaction, we sought to test if leucine zippers mediate the association between MAD1 and NEK2A-(305–446) (NEK2AD3). To this end, a series of deletion mutants were generated as illustrated in Fig. 1A. The NEK2A deletion mutant plasmids were co-transformed with full-length MAD1 cDNA into yeast cells, respectively. We used β-galactosidase activity (LacZ reporter) as a measure for protein-protein interaction. As shown in Fig. 1B, yeast genetic assay indicates full-length MAD1 binds to NEK2A C terminus (amino acids 329–446), a region adjacent to the leucine zipper. However, full-length NEK2A does not interact with MAD1, suggesting that a conformational change of NEK2A, which exposed its C terminus, may be required for exposing its MAD1 binding domain. To map the NEK2A binding interface on MAD1, deletion mutant cDNAs of MAD1 were co-transformed with NEK2AD3 into yeast cells. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, NEK2A binds to the MAD1 central region (amino acids 380–532), which contains a leucine zipper motif. Thus, our yeast genetic assay indicates that the leucine zipper of MAD1 directly binds to the C-terminal 117 amino acids of NEK2A. NEK2A Forms a Complex with the Mitotic Checkpoint Component MAD1—To validate the interaction between MAD1 and NEK2A observed in our yeast two-hybrid assay and test if NEK2A forms a complex with MAD1, we carried out immunoprecipitation in FLAG-MAD1 and GFP-NEK2A co-transfected 293T cells using epitope tag antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A, Western blot using GFP antibody confirmed that NEK2A is pulled down by FLAG immunoprecipitation of MAD1 (lane 8; FLAG intraperitoneal). Conversely, Western blot using FLAG antibody revealed that MAD1 is pulled down by GFP-NEK2A (lane 4; GFP intraperitoneal). No FLAG-tagged MAD1 was precipitated with control IgG (lane 3), and no actin was detected in any of the immunoprecipitates. Thus, we conclude that the interaction between MAD1 and NEK2A is specific. To test if NEK2A directly binds to MAD1 in vitro and to confirm the binding interface from the yeast screen, we employed GST-MAD1 D3 as affinity matrix and loaded equal amounts of bacterial lysates that contain His-NEK2AD3 fusion protein. Western blot, shown in Fig. 2B, using poly-histidine antibody validates that the NEK2A D3S binds to MAD1 via its C terminus. In fact, the interaction of NEK2AD3S and MAD1D3 is very strong and can sustain high salt wash (e.g. 1 m NaCl). An example of a far Western blot shown in Fig. 2C demonstrates that MAD1 C-terminal domain directly binds to the leucine zipper-containing region of NEK2A. Thus, we conclude that NEK2A interacts with MAD1. NEK2A Is Localized to the Kinetochore of Mitotic Cells— Previous studies (20Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) of NEK2A suggest that NEK2A is primarily found at centrosomes and is involved in centrosomal maturation. A recent report (17O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) claimed that NEK2A is also associated with the kinetochore of mitotic cells. Since MAD1 is a kinetochore protein conserved from yeast to human, biochemical interaction between MAD1 and NEK2A propelled us to test whether NEK2A is a centromere protein. To this end, we use a monoclonal NEK2A antibody raised against human protein to test if NEK2A protein is enriched in isolated HeLa cell chromosome fraction. As shown in Fig. 3A, Western blot analysis revealed that the NEK2A antibody specifically recognized a single protein band of ∼46 kDa in whole mitotic HeLa cell extracts, which closely matched the calculated molecular weight of NEK2A (Fig. 3A, left panel). To determine if NEK2A is a centromere-associated protein, we compared NEK2A protein levels in the interphase and mitotic cell lysates with that of isolated chromosome scaffold fraction by using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A (right panel), the NEK2A signal is intensified in isolated chromosome scaffolds compared with that of mitotic cell lysates, a similar profile to CENP-E, indicating that NEK2A is enriched in the isolated chromosome fraction. To ascertain if NEK2A is indeed a kinetochore protein, we adopted a pre-extraction procedure that allows better labeling of kinetochore protein while preserving fine cyto-structure of mitotic cells (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 27Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, pre-extracted HeLa cells were stained using the NEK2A monoclonal antibody and a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, whereas a human CREST anti-centromere antibody that reacts primarily with CENP-B followed by a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-human secondary antibody was used to identify the actual centromere (Fig. 3B, red). In the prometaphase shown in Fig. 3B, NEK2A staining appears as pairs of clearly resolved double dots (green, arrows)"
https://openalex.org/W1974153663,"Four Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIP1 through KChIP4) interact directly with the N-terminal domain of three Shal-type voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3) to modulate cell surface expression and function of Kv4 channels. Here we report a 2.0 Angstrom crystal structure of the core domain of KChIP1 (KChIP1*) in complex with the N-terminal fragment of Kv4.2 (Kv4.2N30). The complex reveals a clam-shaped dimeric assembly. Four EF-hands from each KChIP1 form each shell of the clam. The N-terminal end of Kv4.2 forming an alpha helix (alpha1) and the C-terminal alpha helix (H10) of KChIP1 are enclosed nearly coaxially by these shells. As a result, the H10 of KChIP1 and alpha1 of Kv4.2 mediate interactions between these two molecules, structurally reminiscent of the interactions between calmodulin and its target peptides. Site-specific mutagenesis combined with functional characterization shows that those interactions mediated by alpha1 and H10 are essential to the modulation of Kv4.2 by KChIPs."
https://openalex.org/W2113700116,"The family of calcium binding proteins called KChIPs associates with Kv4 family K(+) channels and modulates their biophysical properties. Here, using mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography, we explore the interaction between Kv4 subunits and KChIP1. Two regions in the Kv4.2 N terminus, residues 7-11 and 71-90, are necessary for KChIP1 modulation and interaction with Kv4.2. When inserted into the Kv1.2 N terminus, residues 71-90 of Kv4.2 are also sufficient to confer association with KChIP1. To provide a structural framework for these data, we solved the crystal structures of Kv4.3N and KChIP1 individually. Taken together with the mutagenesis data, the individual structures suggest that that the Kv4 N terminus is required for stable association with KChIP1, perhaps through a hydrophobic surface interaction, and that residues 71-90 in Kv4 subunits form a contact loop that mediates the specific association of KChIPs with Kv4 subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2056141575,"Oxysterols are common components of oxidized low-density lipoprotein and accumulate in the core of fibrotic plaques as a mixture of cholesterol and cholesteryl ester oxidation products. The proapoptotic effects of a biologically representative mixture of oxysterols was compared with equimolar amounts of 7-ketocholesterol and unoxidized cholesterol. The oxysterol mixture in a concentration range actually detectable in hypercholesterolemic patients did not stimulate programmed cell death in cultivated murine macrophages. Unoxidized cholesterol also produced no effect. By contrast, when given alone, 7-ketocholesterol strongly stimulated the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis with cytochrome c release, caspase-9 activation, and eventually caspase-3 activation. Subsequent experiments showed that when 7-ketocholesterol was administered to cells together with another oxysterol, namely 7betaOH-cholesterol, the strong proapoptotic effect of 7-ketocholesterol was markedly attenuated. As regards the mechanism underlying this quenching, we found that the combined oxysterol treatment counteracted the ability of 7-ketocholesterol, when administered alone, to strongly up-regulate the steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) without interfering with sterol uptake. Furthermore, this increase in intracellular ROS appeared to be responsible for the up-regulation of proapoptotic factor, p21, after treatment with 7-ketocholesterol but not in cells challenged with the oxysterol mixture. Competition among oxysterols, apparently at the level of NADPH oxidase, diminishes the ROS induction and direct toxicity that is evoked by specific oxysterols. As a consequence, a more subtle gene modulation by oxysterols becomes facilitated in vascular cells."
https://openalex.org/W2123369988,"Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases (SSAO) are copper-containing enzymes that oxidatively deaminate primary amines to produce hydrogen peroxide, ammonium, and specific aldehydes. Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is a cell surface and soluble molecule that possesses SSAO activity. VAP-1 protein, SSAO activity, and SSAO reaction products are elevated in the serum of patients with diabetes, congestive heart failure, and specific inflammatory liver diseases. By expressing human VAP-1/SSAO on mouse endothelial cells and subsequently in the serum, and by chronically treating the transgenic mice for 15 months with a high-fat diet and a physiological substrate for SSAO, methylamine, the in vivo roles of SSAO were assessed. The VAP-1 transgene increased the mouse body mass index and subcutaneous abdominal fat pad weights in a manner independent of food consumption. The transgene together with increased SSAO substrate availability enhanced glucose uptake in an SSAO-dependent manner. The increased SSAO activity also led to diabetes-like complications, including advanced glycation end product formation, elevated blood pressure, altered atherosclerosis progression, and nephropathy. These findings suggest that, although manipulation of VAP-1/SSAO has potential to serve as a therapeutic treatment in insulin-resistant conditions, care must be taken to fully understand its impact on obesity and vascular damage."
https://openalex.org/W2053657089,"Mutations in Cx26 are a major cause of autosomal dominant and recessive forms of sensorineural deafness. Some mutations in Cx26 are associated not only with deafness but also with skin disease. We examined the subcellular localization and function of two green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Cx26 point mutants that exhibit both phenotypes, G59A-GFP and D66H-GFP. D66H-GFP was retained within the brefeldin A-insensitive trans-Golgi network, whereas a population of G59A-GFP was transported to the cell surface. Neither G59A nor D66H formed gap junctions that were permeable to small fluorescent dyes, suggesting they are loss-of-function mutations. When co-expressed with wild-type Cx26, both G59A and D66H exerted dominant-negative effects on Cx26 function. G59A also exerted a trans-dominant negative effect on co-expressed wild type Cx32 and Cx43, whereas D66H exerted a trans-dominant negative effect on Cx43 but not Cx32. We propose that the severity of the skin disease is dependent on the specific nature of the Cx26 mutation and the trans-dominant selectivity of the Cx26 mutants on co-expressed connexins. Additional systematic mutations at residue D66, in which the overall charge of this motif was altered, suggested that the first extracellular loop is critical for Cx26 transport to the cell surface as well as function of the resulting gap junction channels.

Gap junctions mediate one method of intercellular communication by allowing for the passage of ions, second messengers, metabolites, and other small molecules. By enabling direct communication between cells, gap junctions are thought to be important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and maintenance of tissue homeostasis (1Loewenstein W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 829-913Google Scholar). Gap junction plaques are composed of a few to hundreds of gap junction channels clustered together. Each individual channel is made up of two hemichannels; one hemichannel (or connexon) is contributed from each of two adjoining cells (2Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Google Scholar). In turn, each connexon consists of six oligomerized polypeptides called connexins (Cx) 1The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexins; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GJIC, gap junctional intercellular communication; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BODIPY, 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4adiaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoic acid; TR, Texas Red; BFA, brefeldin A; TGN, trans-Golgi network. 1The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexins; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GJIC, gap junctional intercellular communication; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BODIPY, 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4adiaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoic acid; TR, Texas Red; BFA, brefeldin A; TGN, trans-Golgi network.

It is well established that the Cx family of genes encode the polypeptide subunits that make up gap junctions, and a recent genomic study highlighted the common features of the 19 mouse and 20 human Cx genes (4Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Guldenagel M. Deutsch U. Sohl G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 725-737Google Scholar). Most tissues express more than one member of the Cx family (3Bruzzone R. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 709-718Google Scholar, 5De Maio A. Vega V.L. Contreras J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 269-282Google Scholar). This is particularly important as connexons composed of different members of the Cx family exhibit selective permeability to fluorescent dyes and endogenous metabolites (6Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Nicholson B.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 457-459Google Scholar, 7Niessen H. Harz H. Bedner P. Kramer K. Willecke K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1365-1372Google Scholar, 8Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K.

Altering the subset of Cxs spatially and temporally expressed may allow cells within a tissue to respond differentially to cell signals, leading to specific changes in differentiation. In addition to homomeric connexons, a connexon may be composed of more than one Cx (heteromeric). For example, heteromeric connexons composed of Cx40/Cx43 or Cx26/Cx32 have been characterized and exhibit altered functional properties compared with their homomeric counterparts (8Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Google Scholar, 11Brink P.R. Cronin K. Banach K. Peterson E. Westphale E.M. Seul K.H. Ramanan S.V. Beyer E.C. Am. J.

Cell Commun. Adhes. 2001; 8: 193-197Google Scholar, 14Lee M.J. Rhee S.K. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 295-300Google Scholar). These combinations further expand the potential multitude of signals that may pass between cells and highlight the requirement to characterize the intermixing that may occur between different Cxs co-expressed within a cell population. Gap junctions are important for keratinocyte growth and differentiation (15Choudhry R. Pitts J.D. Hodgins M.B. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 417-430Google Scholar). According to a recent study using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, at least 10 different Cxs are expressed by keratinocytes, including Cx43, Cx32, Cx30, and Cx26 (16Di W.L. Rugg E.L. Leigh I.M. Kelsell D.P. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 958-964Google Scholar, 17Di W.L. Common J.E. Kelsell D.P. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2001; 8: 415-418Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that mutations in Cx26 are responsible for sensorineural deafness and hyperproliferative skin disease in humans (18Maestrini E. Korge B.P. Ocana-Sierra J. Calzolari E. Cambiaghi S. Scudder P.M. Hovnanian A. Monaco A.P. Munro C.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1237-1243Google Scholar, 19Richard G. Smith L.E. Bailey R.A. Itin P. Hohl D. Epstein Jr., E.H. DiGiovanna J.J. Compton J.G.

Wilgoss A.L. Richard G. Stevens H.P. Munro C.S. Leigh I.M. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 468Google Scholar). At least four different mutations have been associated with both hearing loss and skin disease including R75W (20Richard G. White T.W. Smith L.E. Bailey R.A. Compton J.G. Paul D.L. Bale S.J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 393-399Google Scholar), D66H (18Maestrini E. Korge B.P. Ocana-Sierra J. Calzolari E. Cambiaghi S. Scudder P.M. Hovnanian A. Monaco A.P. Munro C.S. Hum. Mol.

Carter N.D. Patton M.A. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 50-51Google Scholar), and ΔE42 (23Rouan F. White T.W. Brown N. Taylor A.M. Lucke T.W. Paul D.L. Munro C.S. Uitto J. Hodgins M.B. Richard G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2105-2113Google Scholar). Specific symptoms associated with these mutations vary in severity suggesting that mutations within various Cx motifs lead to diverse cellular and subcellular phenotypes (24Kelsell D.P. Dunlop J. Hodgins M.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 2-6Google Scholar). Recently, experiments using paired oocytes revealed that the ΔE42 mutation was able to exert a dominant-negative effect on wild-type Cx26 function and, surprisingly, a partial trans-dominant effect on Cx43 channel function (23Rouan F. White T.W. Brown N. Taylor A.M. Lucke T.W. Paul D.L. Munro C.S. Uitto J. Hodgins M.B. Richard G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2105-2113Google Scholar). Because Cx43 and Cx26 are not thought to form functional heteromeric or heterotypic channels (9Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 805-817Google Scholar, 25White T.W. Bruzzone R. Wolfram S. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 879-892Google Scholar, 26Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 200: 1-13Google Scholar, 27Beyer E.C. Gemel J. Martinez A. Berthoud V.M. Valiunas V. Moreno A.P. Brink P.R. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2001; 8: 199-204Google Scholar), the mechanism by which this effect occurs is not clear. Rouan et al. (23Rouan F. White T.W. Brown N. Taylor A.M. Lucke T.W. Paul D.L. Munro C.S. Uitto J. Hodgins M.B. Richard G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2105-2113Google Scholar) further hypothesized that mutant Cx26 causes skin disease by exerting trans-dominant-negative effects on other Cxs co-expressed in keratinocytes. Although the expression of Cx in Xenopus laevis oocytes has provided extensive information on channel conductivity and regulation (28Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 955-967Google Scholar), this system is more restrictive for examining Cx transport and assembly. Consequently, we chose to study two GFP-tagged Cx26 mutations, D66H-GFP and G59A-GFP, in well understood mammalian cell types. When expressed in gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC)-deficient cell lines, the D66H-GFP mutant was retained within the trans-Golgi apparatus, and a population of the G59A-GFP mutant was transported to the cell surface and assembled into structures reminiscent of gap junctions. Both mutants were non-functional with respect to Lucifer yellow dye permeability when directly compared with GFP-tagged wild-type Cx26. When co-expressed with Cx26, the D66H-GFP mutant was transported to the cell surface but the resulting gap junctions were impermeable to Lucifer yellow, suggesting that this mutant exerted a dominant-negative effect on wild-type Cx26 function. Surprisingly, D66H-GFP was able to exert a limited trans-dominant negative effect on Cx43 but not Cx32. G59A-GFP exerted a dominant-negative effect on Cx26 but also had a trans-dominant-negative effect on Cx32 and Cx43 function. Finally, systematic D66 substitutions with neutral and charged residues revealed that this domain is critical not only for Cx26 transport to the cell surface but also for the establishment of functional channels. Overall, our results suggest that the severity of Cx26-linked skin diseases is probably related to selective trans-dominant interactions with other Cxs expressed within the skin. Cell Lines—All tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. GJIC-deficient HeLa cells and HeLa cells expressing Cx32 (kindly provided by M. Koval, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and normal rat kidney cells, were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The derived cell lines were generated by retroviral infection with viral particles encoding Cx26-GFP, D66H-GFP, or G59A-GFP. As a result, Cx26-GFP, D66H-GFP, or G59A-GFP was expressed alone in HeLa cells or in combination with Cx32. Normal rat kidney cells, which express Cx43 endogenously, were retrovirally infected with cDNAs encoding the Cx26 mutants to generate cell lines co-expressing Cx43 and the Cx26 mutants for the microinjection analysis. GJIC-deficient HBL-100 breast tumor cells and derived cell lines (29Laird D.W. Fistouris P. Batist G. Alpert L. Huynh H.T. Carystinos G.D. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4104-4110Google Scholar) were cultured in 10% calf serum-supplemented medium. HBL-100 cells expressing Cx26-GFP, D66H-GFP, or G59A-GFP alone or in combination with Cx26 were generated by retroviral infection. In addition, HBL-100 cells were also generated to co-express Cx43 and D66H-GFP by retroviral infection. Co-expression of Cx30 and D66H-GFP was carried out in HeLa cells by transient transfection. Mutant and Wild-type Connexin cDNA Constructs, Transfections, and Infections—cDNA encoding Cx43, Cx30, and Cx26 were kindly provided by Dr. C. C. G. Naus (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Cx43 and Cx26 were cloned into the replication-defective retroviral vector AP2 (30Galipeau J.L.H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394Google Scholar) as described previously (31Mao A.J. Bechberger J. Lidington D. Galipeau J. Laird D.W. Naus C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34407-34414Google Scholar, 32Qin H. Shao Q. Curtis H. Galipeau J. Belliveau D.J. Wang T. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29132-29138Google Scholar). Human Cx26 mutants G59A, D66H, D66A, D66E, and D66K were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions. The following primer pairs were used to create the Cx26 mutations. The nucleotide change in each case is underlined: D66H: sense, 5′-GCAAGAACGTGTGCTACCATCACTACTTCCCCATCTCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGAGATGGGGAAGTAGTGATGGTAGCACACGTTCTTGC-3′; G59A: sense, 5′-GCAACACCCTGCAGCCAGCCTGCAAGAACGTGTGC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCACACGTTCTTGCAGGCTGGCTGCAGGGTGTTGC-3′.; D66A: sense, 5′-GCAAGAACGTGTGCTACGCTCACTACTTCCCCATCTCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGAGATGGGGAAGTAGTGAGCGTAGCACACGTTGTTGC-3′; D66E: sense, 5′-GCAAGAACGTGTGCTACGAGCACTACTTCCCCATCTCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGAGATGGGGAAGTAGTGCTCGTAGCACACGTTCTTGC-3′; D66K: sense, 5′-GCAAGAACGTGTGCTACAAGCACTACTTCCCCATCTCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGAGATGGGGAAGTAGTGCTTGTAGCACACGTTCTTGC-3′. After sequencing to verify mutation and to ensure no other mutations were introduced, PCR was used to add XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of Cx26, D66H, or G59A, and the resulting cDNAs were cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) and sequenced for verification. A 17-amino-acid linker sequence separates the Cx26 and GFP moieties of the resulting fusions Cx26-GFP, D66H-GFP, G59A-GFP, D66E-GFP, D66K-GFP, and D66A-GFP. Next Cx26-GFP, D66H-GFP, and G59A-GFP cDNAs were inserted into the XhoI and NotI sites of the replication-defective AP2 retroviral expression vector (30Galipeau J.L.H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394Google Scholar). Supernatants containing retroviral particles encoding the Cx26, Cx43, Cx26-GFP, G59A-GFP, and D66H-GFP were generated as described elsewhere (31Mao A.J. Bechberger J. Lidington D. Galipeau J. Laird D.W. Naus C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34407-34414Google Scholar, 32Qin H. Shao Q. Curtis H. Galipeau J. Belliveau D.J. Wang T. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29132-29138Google Scholar). After 3 rounds of retroviral infection and several medium changes and cell passages, at least 80% of cells were found to stably express the appropriate complement of Cxs (31Mao A.J. Bechberger J. Lidington D. Galipeau J. Laird D.W. Naus C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34407-34414Google Scholar). These cells were subsequently used for immunofluorescent and dye coupling experiments as described below. Studies on the subcellular localization and function of D66E-GFP, D66A-GFP, and D66K-GFP were carried out using HeLa cells transiently transfected with these three D66 mutations as described below. Cx30 cDNA, encoded within the pBluescript vector, was digested with XhoI and NotI and cloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pEGFP-N1 vector. This combination of restriction enzymes removes the enhanced GFP cDNA from the vector. Co-expression of Cx30 and D66H-GFP and expression of D66A-GFP, D66E-GFP, and D66K-GFP was carried out by transient transfection using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). For co-expression of Cx30 and D66H-GFP, HeLa cells were grown to 60% confluence on 12-mm coverslips and co-transfected with 1 μg of cDNA encoding Cx30 and 1 μg of cDNA encoding D66H-GFP. Expression of D66A-GFP, D66E-GFP, or D66K-GFP was carried out similarly. The cells were fixed 48 h later and immunolabeled as appropriate. Triton X-100 Extraction—Triton X-100 soluble components of HBL-100 cells expressing Cx26-GFP, G59A-GFP, or D66H-GFP were extracted according to a modified procedure of Musil et al. (33Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Google Scholar). Cells were grown on glass coverslips until reaching 70-80% confluence. After two rinses in serum-free medium, cells were incubated in 1% Triton X-100 diluted in serum-free medium for 15 min. Cells were then quickly rinsed in PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and immunolabeled with antibodies specific for giantin and LAMP2 as described below. Inhibition of Degradation, Immunocytochemistry, and Confocal Microscope Imaging—To inhibit lysosomal or proteasomal degradation, cells were incubated in the presence of 100 μg/ml leupeptin or 10 μm lactacystin, respectively, for 6 h. After retroviral infection, treatment or transient transfection, cells grown on 12-mm glass coverslips were fixed in a solution of ice-cold 80% methanol and 20% acetone for 10 min followed by rinses with PBS and then processed for immunolabeling as described previously (34Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Google Scholar). Cx expression was analyzed using a mouse anti-Cx32 (1:1500 dilution; HAM8, generously provided by Y. Fujikura) (35Fujikura Y. Ohta H. Hirai T. Fukumoto T. Anat. Rec. 1993; 235: 335-341Google Scholar), mouse anti-Cx26 (1:200 dilution; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), rabbit anti-Cx43 (1:500 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich), and rabbit anti-Cx30 (1:200 dilution; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Rabbit polyclonal anti-giantin was purchased from Bio/Can Scientific (Mississauga, ON, Canada) and used at a 1:500 dilution. Secondary antibodies conjugated to Texas Red or fluorescein isothiocyanate were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (Westgrove, PA). After immunolabeling, coverslips were mounted and images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Final images were prepared using Corel Draw 10 software. Visualization of the Golgi Apparatus using BODIPY-TR Ceramide—To visualize the subcellular localization of D66H-GFP more closely, HBL-100 cells expressing D66H-GFP were treated with 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) for up to 3 h. Cells on coverslips were fixed at various intervals during BFA treatment and the Golgi apparatus was labeled, after fixation, with BODIPY-TR ceramide (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) that was prepared per the manufacturer's instructions. After fixation in ice-cold 80% methanol/20% acetone solution, cells on 12-mm coverslips were incubated with BODIPY-TR ceramide for 1 h, washed three times with 1× PBS, and mounted in Airvol on microscope slides. Single Cell Microinjection—After a fresh medium change, cell lines stably (or transiently in the case of D66A-GFP, D66E-GFP, and D66K-GFP) expressing wild-type or mutant Cx (minimum of two cell passages after infection to ensure stable expression and removal of all viral particles) were pressure microinjected with 5% Lucifer yellow (Molecular Probes) using an Eppendorf microinjection system and a Zeiss inverted epifluorescent microscope. Digital images capturing the dye spread were acquired with a charge-coupled device Sensicam 1 min after microinjection, and the number of neighboring cells receiving dye was counted. At least 20 cells were microinjected for each Cx expression complement. Results are expressed as the mean number of cells receiving dye per microinjection ± S.E.M. The results were analyzed by non-parametric analysis of variance using the statistical analysis software Instat 3.0. Determination of the Relative Stability of Cx26-GFP, G59A-GFP, and D66H-GFP—HBL-100 cells expressing Cx26-GFP, G59A-GFP, and D66H-GFP were incubated in culture medium containing 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (36Qin H. Shao Q. Igdoura S.A. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30005-30014Google Scholar) at 0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, and 5 h after the addition of cycloheximide. After SDS-PAGE and transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes, nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membranes in 5% milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min. Western blotting was carried out as described previously (36Qin H. Shao Q. Igdoura S.A. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30005-30014Google Scholar) with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 1:3000 dilution). After detection of GFP-tagged connexins, membranes were stripped using reblot mild stripping solution (Chemicon) as per manufacturer's directions and re-probed with an anti-vimentin antibody (Chemicon; 1:5000 dilution). To estimate the relative stability of the wild-type and mutant Cx26 proteins, blots were scanned and densitometry was performed using Scion Image software. The integrated band intensities of GFP-tagged connexins were standardized using the vimentin signal as a control. Subcellular Localization of Cx26 Mutants G59A and D66H—To determine whether wild-type Cx26 and G59A and D66H mutants formed gap junctions at the cell surface, these Cxs were expressed in GJIC-deficient HBL-100 cells (32Qin H. Shao Q. Curtis H. Galipeau J. Belliveau D.J. Wang T. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29132-29138Google Scholar). Cx26-GFP was efficiently transported to the cell surface and formed gap junction plaques in HBL-100 cells (Fig. 1A, arrows). The G59A-GFP mutant was localized inside the cell within a wide array of punctate structures and at the cell surface, where it appeared in gap junction-like plaques (Fig. 1D, arrows) The D66H-GFP mutant, however, was primarily retained within a distinct juxtanuclear intracellular compartment (Fig. 1G, double arrow). To determine the localization of intracellularly retained wild-type or mutant Cx26, HBL-100 cells were immunolabeled for a constituent resident of the Golgi apparatus, giantin. A small population of both Cx26-GFP (Fig. 1, A-C, double arrows) and G59A-GFP (Fig. 1, D-F, double arrows) exhibited some cellular localization in the general proximity of giantin. The D66H-GFP mutant, on the other hand, co-localized almost completely with giantin (Fig. 1, G-I, double arrows). Musil et al. (33Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Google Scholar) reported that upon channel clustering at the cell surface, gap junctions were resistant to extraction by Triton-X-100 in situ. We treated live HBL-100 cells expressing Cx26-GFP, G59A-GFP, or D66H-GFP with Triton X-100 and found that a significant number of detergent-resistant structures containing Cx26-GFP (Fig. 2B, arrows) or G59A-GFP (Fig. 2D, arrows) were present at the cell surface. The intracellular-retained D66H-GFP mutant, however, was completely detergent-sensitive (Fig. 2F). As controls, immunolabeling studies revealed that both giantin and LAMP-2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein-2) were sensitive to Triton X-100 extraction (data not shown). To more precisely identify the Golgi compartment that housed the D66H-GFP mutant, the cis-Golgi network, cis, medial, and trans compartments of the Golgi apparatus were disrupted with BFA (34Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Google Scholar), and BFA-treated cells were examined to determine whether the D66H-GFP mutant resided in the BFA-resistant trans-Golgi network (TGN). When D66H-GFP-expressing HBL-100 cells were treated with BFA for 30 min, a significant population of D66H-GFP did not redistribute into the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas giantin was found to completely redistribute within the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3, A-D). However, when D66H-GFP-expressing HBL-100 cells were labeled with BODIPY ceramide, which labels all compartments of the Golgi apparatus, a significant population of BODIPY did not redistribute upon BFA-treatment, and the remaining perinuclear BODIPY staining co-localized extensively with the BFA-insensitive population of D66H-GFP (Fig. 3, E-H). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that D66H-GFP is retained within the TGN and that a mutation at residue D66 has dramatic effects on the ability of Cx26 to continue to be transported to the cell surface. Gap Junctions Formed by G59A-GFP Are Not Permeable to Lucifer Yellow—To determine whether the mutations in Cx26 led to loss-of-function gap junction channels, HeLa cells expressing Cx26-GFP, G59A-GFP, or D66H-GFP were microinjected with Lucifer yellow, and the number of neighboring cells receiving dye was counted. Whereas microinjected Lucifer yellow spread to an average of 6.5 ± 0.8 Cx26-GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 4, A-C, J) only 0.3 ± 0.1 G59A-expressing cells received dye (Fig. 4, D-F, J). Not surprisingly, because D66H-GFP did not form detectable gap junction plaques, HeLa cells expressing D66H-GFP transferred dye to only 0.5 ± 0.1 cells (Fig. 4, G-I, J). These studies were repeated in HBL-100 cells with virtually identical results (Fig. 4J). Both the G59A and D66H mutants were also found to be impermeable to the fluorescent dye calcein AM, confirming that they were loss-of-function mutations (data not shown). Connexin-specific Differential Rescue of D66H-GFP Transport to the Cell Surface and Gap Junction Plaque Formation—To assess whether specific Cxs could rescue the transport of TGN-retained D66H-GFP to the cell surface, we examined 1) HeLa cells that co-expressed Cx32 or Cx30 in addition to D66H-GFP and 2) HBL-100 cells that co-expressed Cx26 or Cx43 in addition to D66H-GFP. To distinguish between wild-type rat Cx26 and the human D66H-GFP Cx26 mutant in co-expression studies, we immunolabeled cells with an antibody from Zymed Laboratories Inc. that reacted with rat Cx26 but, in our immunofluorescence studies, did not cross-react with the human Cx26-GFP or the Cx26 mutants. When co-expressed with wild-type rat Cx26, a significant population of D66H-GFP was transported to the cell surface and assembled into gap junction plaques (Fig. 5, A-C, arrows), without any apparent increase in retention of wild-type Cx26 within the Golgi apparatus. When D66H-GFP was co-expressed with Cx32, Cx32 was also able to rescue the assembly of a population of D66H-GFP into gap junction plaques (Fig. 5, D-F, arrows). Likewise, the co-expression of Cx30 and D66H-GFP resulted in D66H-GFP transport and assembly into gap junction plaques (Fig. 5, J-L, arrows). However, when co-expressed with Cx43, D66H-GFP was still retained within the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5, G-I, arrows), and Cx43 distribution at the cell surface did not seem to be affected. These results indicate that D66H-GFP is capable of being transported to the cell surface and assembled into gap junctions when co-expressed with specific members of the Cx family of proteins. As controls, when wild-type Cx26, Cx32, or Cx43 was expressed alone in HeLa or HBL-100 cells, typical gap junction plaques were assembled (Fig. 5, M-O, arrows). Inhibition of Lysosomal and Proteasomal Degradation Fails to Rescue D66H-GFP Transport to the Cell Surface—Because D66H-GFP was retained within the Golgi apparatus and co-expression with specific Cxs was able to rescue D66H-GFP transport to the cell surface, we investigated whether the failure to detect D66H-GFP at the cell surface was a result of premature targeting of the mutant Cx26 to lysosomes or proteasomes for degradation. In the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor, leupeptin, there was an increase in intracellular Cx26-GFP (Fig. 6C) and D66H-GFP (Fig. 6D) compared with nontreated HBL-100 cells expressing Cx26-GFP (Fig. 6A) or D66H-GFP (Fig. 6B). The proteasome inhibitor lactacystin did not noticeably affect the distribution of either Cx26-GFP or D66H-GFP (Fig. 6, E and F). Because there was no apparent rescue of D66H-GFP to the cell surface in the presence of either lysosome or proteasome inhibitors, these results suggest that the defect in D66H-GFP trafficking is not the result of premature degradation. D66H-GFP Has a Prolonged Half-life—To determine whether either of the Cx26 mutants exhibited altered turnover kinetics, we treated cells with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis and examined the levels of Cx26 and Cx26 mutants over time by Western blots (Fig. 7A). Both Cx26-GFP and G59A-GFP had"

VSMC exposed to serum-free medium conditioned by apoptotic EC showed increased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, enhanced Bcl-xl expression, and inhibition of p53 expression. Fractionation of the conditioned medium followed by mass spectral analysis identified one bioactive component as a C-terminal fragment of the domain V of perlecan. Serum-free medium supplemented with either a synthetic peptide containing the EGF motif of the domain V of perlecan or chondroitin 4-sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan anchored on the domain V of perlecan, increased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation and Bcl-xl protein levels while inhibiting apoptosis of VSMC. These results suggest that a proteolytic activity developing downstream of activated caspases in apoptotic EC initiates degradation of pericellular proteoglycans and liberation of bioactive fragments with a robust impact on inhibition of VSMC apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2144526788,"Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) possess unique receptors that recognize and internalize hyaluronic acid (HA). To develop a system for targeting foreign DNA to SECs, comb-type polycations having HA side chains were prepared by coupling HA to poly(L-lysine) (PLL). The HA-grafted-PLL copolymer (PLL-g-HA) thus formed was mixed with DNA in 154 mM NaCl to form soluble nanoassociates bearing hydrated hyaluronate shells. Agarose gel retardation assays revealed selective interaction of the PLL backbone with DNA despite the presence of polyanionic HA side chains. To determine whether the PLL-g-HA/DNA complexes were recognized by SEC HA receptors in vivo, we injected Wistar rats i.v. via the tail vein with PLL-g-HA complexed to a beta-galactosidase expression plasmid (pSV beta-Gal) labeled with 32P. One hour postinjection, >90% of the injected radioactivity remained in the liver. Administration of the PLL-g-HA complexed to an FITC-labeled DNA revealed that the carrier-DNA complex was distributed exclusively in SECs. A large number of SECs expressing beta-galactosidase was detected along the sinusoidal lining after transfection with PLL-g-HA/pSV beta-Gal. Moreover, PLL-g-HA effectively stabilized DNA triplex formation. In conclusion, the new PLL-g-HA/DNA carrier system permits targeted transfer of exogenous genes selectively to the SECs."
https://openalex.org/W1990647750,"Information gating through the thalamus is dependent on the output of thalamic relay neurons. These relay neurons receive convergent innervation from a number of sources, including GABA-containing interneurons that provide feed-forward inhibition. These interneurons are unique in that they have two distinct outputs: axonal and dendritic. In addition to conventional axonal outputs, these interneurons have presynaptic dendrites that may provide localized inhibitory influences. Our study indicates that synaptic activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) increases inhibitory activity in relay neurons by increasing output of presynaptic dendrites of interneurons. Optic tract stimulation increases inhibitory activity in thalamic relay neurons in a frequency- and intensity-dependent manner and is attenuated by mGluR antagonists. Our data suggest that synaptic activation of mGluRs selectively alters dendritic output but not axonal output of thalamic interneurons. This mechanism could serve an important role in focal, feed-forward information processing in addition to dynamic information processing in thalamocortical circuits."

However, little is currently known about the mechanism by which this may occur. Here we show the key signaling pathway that mediates GTP-dependent exocytosis. Incubation of permeabilized PC12 cells with soluble RalA GTPase, but not RhoA or Rab3A GTPases, strongly inhibited GTP-dependent exocytosis. A Ral-binding fragment from Sec5, a component of the exocyst complex, showed a similar inhibition. Point mutations in both RalA (RalAE38R) and the Sec5 (Sec5T11A) fragment, which abolish RalA-Sec5 interaction also abolished the inhibition of GTP-dependent exocytosis. Moreover, transfection with wild-type RalA, but not RalAE38R, enhanced GTP-dependent exocytosis. In contrast the RalA and the Sec5 fragment showed no inhibition of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, but cleavage of a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein by Botulinum neurotoxin blocked both GTP- and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Our results indicate that the interaction between RalA and the exocyst complex (containing Sec5) is essential for GTP-dependent exocytosis.

Although this phenomenon is well established, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Many monomeric and trimeric GTPases (GTP/GDP-binding proteins) exist in mammalian cells. In particular, the Rho, Rab, and Ral families of low molecular weight proteins, which are monomeric GTPases, have been suggested as regulators of exocytosis. Rho family proteins have been proposed to regulate exocytosis in mast cells (10Pinxteren J.A. O'Sullivan A.J. Larbi K.Y. Tatham P.E. Gomperts B.D.

These results suggest the involvement of the mammalian exocyst in exocytotic processes, although its exact function in exocytosis is not yet understood. In this study, we sought to identify a key GTPase and its effector(s) that mediate GTP-dependent exocytosis using neuroendocrine PC12 cells.

Because PC12 cells show robust Ca2+-dependent secretion, we also sought to explain the relationship between GTP-dependent exocytosis and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. We suggest that GTP-dependent exocytosis and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis use different sensors and effectors for triggering exocytosis.

The supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended with 5 ml of KGlu buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1 mm MgCl2. The resuspended material was subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant (brain homogenate) was used for binding. For loading guanine nucleotides, GSH agarose containing ∼20 μg of GST-RalAWT or GST-RalAE38R was incubated with KGlu buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 200 μm GDP or GppNHp for 30 min at 30 °C. The buffer was adjusted to 5 mm MgCl2 at the end of reaction. The GSH-agarose was recovered by centrifugation and was incubated with 1 ml of brain homogenate at 4 °C overnight and washed three times with KGlu buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1 mm MgCl2. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Sec6 and Sec8 were probed with monoclonal antibodies (StressGen) and detected by chemiluminescence (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GST Pull-down Experiment with Recombinant Sec5 Fragments— Brain homogenate was prepared as above except that the pellet was resuspended with 5 ml of KGlu buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EDTA. Brain homogenate was incubated with 200 μm GDP or GppNHp for 30 min at 30 °C and was adjusted to 3 mm MgCl2 at the end of the reaction. GSH-agarose containing ∼20 μg of GST-Sec5-(2–120)WT or GST-Sec5-(2–120)T11A was incubated with 1 ml of brain homogenate loaded with either GDPβS or GppNHp at 4 °C overnight and was washed five times with KGlu buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1 mm MgCl2. The presence of RalA and Rab3A was determined by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies (for anti-RalA, purchase from BD Biosciences, for anti-Rab3A, Cl.42.2, a kind gift from Dr. Reinhard Jahn). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy— PC12 cells transfected with pCMV9E10myc-RalAWT or pCMV9E10myc-RalAE38R were grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed for 15 min with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.3% bovine serum albumin for 5 min. Nonspecific sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies against Myc (mouse 9E10 ascites diluted 1:1000, Covance) and secretogranin II (rabbit polyclonal antiserum diluted 1:1000, GED Bioscience) were diluted in blocking buffer and applied to the permeabilized cells for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes in blocking buffer, goat fluorescein-conjugated anti mouse (diluted 1:1000) and goat rhodamine red-x-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (diluted 1:3000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were diluted in blocking buffer and applied for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in blocking buffer and mounted in FluorSave™ reagent (Calbiochem). Immunofluorescence staining was monitored with a Zeiss laser confocal scanning microscope (LSM 410) with a water immersion objective lens (×63). Pharmacological Characterization of GppNHp-induced Exocytosis—We first confirmed a previous finding that GppNHp together with Mg2+ induces NE secretion from permeabilized PC12 cells (43Klenchin V.A. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. Methods. 1998; 16: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As previously reported (43Klenchin V.A. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. Methods. 1998; 16: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the dose-response curve was bell-shaped, and with high concentrations of MgGppNHp, NE release was suppressed (Fig. 1A). To clarify the relative role of Mg2+ for this suppression, we tested GppNHp-induced NE release in the absence of Mg2+. Low concentrations (0.1–10 μm) of GppNHp and Mg-GppNHp induced similar levels of exocytosis. However, at high concentrations (100 μm to 1 mm), GppNHp stimulated increased levels of exocytosis relative to Mg-GppNHp (Fig. 1A). This result suggests that suppression at high doses is primarily because of high concentrations of Mg2+. To further validate our findings we also examined the effects of Mg2+ concentrations on GppNHp-induced exocytosis by varying the concentration of free Mg2+ ([Mg2+]free) independent of GppNHp by using a Mg2+/EDTA buffer. When Mg2+ was chelated by 1.8 mm EDTA (0 μm ([Mg2+]free) GppNHp-induced secretion was completely abolished, suggesting an essential role for Mg2+ in GTP-dependent exocytosis. In contrast 0.7 μm [Mg2+]free rescued GppNHp-induced exocytosis (Fig. 1B). However, at 6–45 μm [Mg2+]free, GppNHp-induced exocytosis was less efficient than at 0.7 μm [Mg2+]free (Fig. 1B). Thus, we conclude that while submicromolar to micromolar [Mg2+]free is required for GppNHp-induced exocytosis, more than 10 μm [Mg2+]free inhibits GppNHp-induced exocytosis. The complex action of Mg2+ on GppNHp-induced exocytosis is reminiscent of the interaction between Mg2+ and GTPases. Thus, we hypothesized that GppNHp-induced exocytosis is mediated by activated GTPases and that the inhibition of exocytosis by high concentrations of Mg2+ is due to the stabilizing effects of Mg2+ on the nucleotide-bound form of GTPases (48Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 49Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). After permeabilization and washes, GTPases in PC12 cells are mostly in a GDP-bound form and Mg2+ prevents GppNHp from binding to the target GTPase by drastically decreasing the off-rate of GDP (48Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 49Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predicted that GppNHp-induced exocytosis would be inhibited by increased concentrations of GDP. Indeed, GDP inhibited GppNHp (100 μm)-induced exocytosis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C), supporting a role for activated GTPases in GppNHp-induced exocytosis. Inhibition of GTP-dependent Exocytosis by Soluble RalA, but Not RhoA or Rab3A—We sought to identify the GTPase involved in GppNHp-induced exocytosis. Three small GTPases were considered as possible candidates: RhoA, Rab3A, and RalA. We hypothesized that if one of these GTPase proteins was responsible for GTP-dependent exocytosis, it would inhibit exocytosis by functioning as a dominant negative protein. This is a realistic possibility because the recombinant proteins generated in E. coli lack prenylation for proper membrane localization. On incubation of permeabilized PC12 cells with soluble recombinant proteins, we found that the strong inhibition was mediated by recombinant RalA, but not by RhoA or Rab3A (Fig. 2B). This effect was not caused by variable purities among GST fusion proteins as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2A). Strong inhibition by RalA was not caused by competition for binding of GppNHp to native GT-Pases (buffering effect) because the concentration of recombinant proteins used in Fig. 2B was ∼1 μm, 100 times lower than the concentrations of GppNHp (100 μm). A dose-response curve indicated that the inhibition by RalA became evident at concentrations of 0.1 μm (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, higher concentrations of GppNHp (e.g. 1 mm) did not reverse the inhibition by RalA (Fig. 2D), thus further arguing against a potential buffering of available GppNHp. Therefore, we reasoned that recombinant RalA inhibits exocytosis as a dominant negative by binding to the target of endogenous GTPase(s). A Ral Binding Fragment from Sec5, but Not RhoGDI, Inhibits GTP-dependent Exocytosis—The exocyst has been recently identified as an effector complex for Ral (24Brymora A. Valova V.A. Larsen M.R.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Ral physically binds to Sec5, one of the eight proteins comprising the exocyst complex, in a GTP-dependent manner. We hypothesized that if the exocyst functions as the effector for Ral in GTP-dependent exocytosis, a fragment of Sec5 (residues 2–120) that binds to Ral (25Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G.

Indeed we found that this Sec5 fragment inhibited GTP-dependent exocytosis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). We also examined the effects of RhoGDI (11Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K.

https://openalex.org/W2087859070,"The factor VII activating protease (FSAP) is a serine-protease present in human plasma that serves to activate single-chain plasminogen activators, as well as coagulation factor VII. FSAP was localized within atherosclerotic lesions, and a genetic polymorphism in FSAP is associated with carotid stenosis. Hence, this study was conducted to gain broader insights into the cellular effects of FSAP on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). DNA synthesis and cell proliferation assays revealed an inhibitory action of FSAP on platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB)-mediated proliferation of VSMC. FSAP also inhibited PDGF-BB-induced migration of VSMC. These cellular effects of FSAP could be neutralized by an anti-FSAP mAb as well as by protease inhibitors such as aprotinin or a chloromethylketone inhibitor. Moreover, unfractionated heparin promoted the antiproliferative effect of FSAP on VSMC and was essential for the inhibition of VSMC migration. FSAP inhibited PDGF-BB binding to human VSMC and concomitantly blocked PDGF-BB-dependent phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinase p42/p44 and tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins. These results unravel a new function of FSAP as an inhibitor of the proatherogenic phenotype of vascular smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2148689156,"To dissect the role of the globular domains of PGM/versican--a large hyaluronan binding proteoglycan (PG) enriched in tumor lesions--we have stably transduced a human leiomyosarcoma cell line with either the G1 or G3 domain of the PG and subsequently assayed the effect of this manipulation on several cellular processes in vitro and in vivo. G1- and G3-overexpressing cells were found to exhibit an enhanced growth that was more accentuated in the absence of serum components and was seen both when cells were cultured on ECM substrates and in the absence of ECM anchorage. Accordingly, if inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice, G1 transfectants formed larger tumor masses than control cells at the site of implantation, albeit after a certain latency period. Upon binding to cell surface CD44, proliferation of G1-, but not G3-, overexpressing cells were dose dependently inhibited by exogenous hyaluronan (HA) or HA fragments. G1- and G3-transduced cells did not differ in their intrinsic ability to adhere and migrate on various purified ECM components, whereas G1-overproducing sarcoma cells were more invasive than the corresponding G3 mutants, and their locomotion was perturbed by exogenous HA. The augmented anchorage-independent growth exhibited solely by G1-transduced was largely ascribable to a reduced apoptotic rate, thereby indicating a shift in the proliferation--apoptosis equilibrium of the cells toward the former. In fact, G1-overexpressing cells appeared resistant to both cytotoxic drug-induced and Fas-dependent programmed cell death, and this resistance implicated mitochondrial apoptotic genes. The results indicate that the terminal domains of versican may differentially control propagation of tumor cells and diversely modulate their responses to environmental HA."
https://openalex.org/W2151392038,"In contrast to the well known cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α in many mammary cancer cells, we have found that TNF stimulates the proliferation and motility of human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Since the response of HMECs to TNF is similar to effects mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, we explored the potential role of cross-talk through the EGFR signaling pathways in mediating cellular responses to TNF. Using a microarray enzyme-linked immunoassay, we found that exposure to TNF stimulated the dose-dependent shedding of the EGFR ligand transforming growth factor α (TGFα). Both proliferation and motility of HMECs induced by TNF was prevented either by inhibiting membrane protein shedding with a metalloprotease inhibitor, by blocking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity, or by limiting ligand-receptor interactions with an antagonistic anti-EGFR antibody. EGFR activity was also necessary for TNF-induced release of matrix metalloprotease-9, thought to be an essential regulator of mammary cell migration. The cellular response to TNF was associated with a biphasic temporal pattern of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, which was EGFR-dependent and modulated by inhibition of metalloprotease-mediated shedding. Significantly, the late phase of ERK phosphorylation, detectable within 4 h after exposure, was blocked by the metalloprotease inhibitor batimastat, indicating that autocrine signaling through ligand shedding was responsible for this secondary wave of ERK activity.

Originally discovered for its ability to induce hemorrhagic necrosis in tumor cells (1Carswell E.A. Old L.J. Kassel R.L. Green S. Fiore N. Williamson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3666-3670Google Scholar), TNF is perhaps best known for inducing cytotoxicity and apoptosis in transformed cells. In many non-transformed cells, however, TNF is thought to mediate an important prosurvival role. For example, cell death in response to TNF is rarely observed in normal cells unless inhibitors of transcription or translation are concurrently administered, suggesting gene regulatory pathways regulated by TNF signaling include cytoprotective pathways (2Natoli G. Costanzo A. Guido F. Moretti F. Levrero M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 915-920Google Scholar, 3Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 1041-1050Google Scholar). In particular, normal mammary epithelial cells (MECs) are relatively resistant to TNF cytotoxicity as compared with mammary cancer cells (4Dollbaum C. Creasey A.A. Dairkee S.H. Hiller A.J. Rudolph A.R. Lin L. Vitt C. Smith H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4740-4744Google Scholar, 5Mueller H. Flury N. Liu R. Scheidegger S. Eppenberger U. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 2312-2318Google Scholar), and some reports suggest TNF plays a physiological role as both a survival factor and mitogen in normal mammary epithelium (6Ip M.M. Shoemaker S.F. Darcy K.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2833-2844Google Scholar, 7Varela L.M. Stangle-Castor N.C. Shoemaker S.F. Shea-Eaton W.K. Ip M.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 120-131Google Scholar, 8Varela L.M. Ip M.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4915-4924Google Scholar). For example, in primary rat MECs, TNF stimulates proliferation and up-regulates matrix metalloproteases necessary for cell motility and branching morphogenesis (6Ip M.M. Shoemaker S.F. Darcy K.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2833-2844Google Scholar, 7Varela L.M. Stangle-Castor N.C. Shoemaker S.F. Shea-Eaton W.K. Ip M.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 120-131Google Scholar). MEC proliferation and branching during puberty is also delayed in TNF null mice (9Stangle N.C. Kollias G. Ip M.M. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40: 161Google Scholar). Consistent with having an important physiological role, expression of TNF and its receptors is tightly regulated throughout mammary development and is elevated during pregnancy prior to the onset of lactation and mammary proliferation (8Varela L.M. Ip M.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4915-4924Google Scholar). Despite these reports, it is not clear whether these are direct TNF signaling responses or secondary responses mediated through interactions with additional growth factor pathways involved in MEC regulation. The cellular effects of TNF are initiated by two distinct surface receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), which are expressed on most cell types. Numerous post-receptor signaling pathways appear to be activated by TNF, and this might explain the diversity of cellular responses elicited. However, this complexity has also made it challenging to identify key events involved in the induction of specific cellular responses. For instance, all of the major mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (p38, JNK, and ERK families) can be stimulated by TNF, although the signaling intermediates involved are still poorly understood (10Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Google Scholar). These pathways converge on key transcription factors such as NFκB and AP-1, providing a mechanism for integration at the level of gene regulation (11Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar). Additional prosurvival pathways independent of NFκB, such as Akt activation, also contribute to the anti-apoptotic effects of TNF in some systems (12Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Google Scholar, 13Lee S.E. Chung W.J. Kwak H.B. Chung C.H. Kwack K.B. Lee Z.H. Kim H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49343-49349Google Scholar). This signaling complexity is thought to provide a flexible mechanism that can elicit a range of cellular responses to different extracellular environments where elevated levels of soluble TNF are present. Identifying the post-receptor binding events that underlie this complexity is therefore an important goal. There is growing appreciation for the importance of cross-talk among heterologous receptor signaling pathways in coordinating cellular responses. A potentially important pathway for modulating TNF-mediated responses is that of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Earlier studies have reported relationships between TNF and EGFR signaling cascades at several levels of regulation. In cervical and pancreatic cancer cell lines, TNF stimulates expression of ligands for EGFR (14Woodworth C.D. McMullin E. Iglesias M. Plowman G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2840-2844Google Scholar, 15Schmiegel W. Roeder C. Schmielau J. Rodeck U. Kalthoff H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 863-867Google Scholar). A study in fibroblasts reported that transactivation of EGFR by TNF plays a pivotal role in NFκB activation (16Hirota K. Murata M. Itoh T. Yodoi J. Fukuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25953-25958Google Scholar). TNF also sensitizes carcinoma cell xenografts to anti-EGFR therapy, indicating that TNF and EGFR signaling pathways in cancer cells are interconnected (17Hambek M. Solbach C. Schnuerch H.-G. Roller M. Stegmueller M. Sterner-Kock A. Kiefer J. Knecht R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1045-1049Google Scholar). The importance of EGFR signaling in regulation of normal mammary epithelial cell proliferation, motility, and survival is well established (18Stern D.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 89-98Google Scholar, 19Stampfer M.R. Pan C.H. Hosoda J. Bartholomew J. Mendelsohn J. Yaswen P. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 175-188Google Scholar, 20Wiley H.S. Woolf M.F.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1198-1205Google Scholar). We were, therefore, interested in investigating the effects of TNF in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and determining whether the effects involved EGFR signaling. Our studies revealed that low levels of TNF stimulate proliferation and cell motility through mechanisms that are dependent, at least in part, on EGFR autocrine signaling. The results also indicate that the cellular response to TNF is strongly influenced by its ability to modulate other receptor systems by inducing shedding of growth factors. Cell Culture and Reagents—Human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), strain 184A1 (22Stampfer M.R. Yaswen P. Cancer Surv. 1993; 18: 7-34Google Scholar), were routinely cultured in DFCI-1 medium supplemented with 12.5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (Calbiochem) as previously described (20Wiley H.S. Woolf M.F. Opresko L.K. Burke P.M. Will B. Morgan J.R. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1317-1328Google Scholar). Batimastat was generously provided by British Biotech Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Recombinant soluble human TNF, the EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035, and MMP-3 Inhibitor I were purchased from Calbiochem. The EGFR-neutralizing monoclonal antibody 225 (225 mAb) was purified from hybridoma supernatants as previously described (20Wiley H.S. Woolf M.F. Opresko L.K. Burke P.M. Will B. Morgan J.R. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1317-1328Google Scholar). All other reagents were of cell culture or molecular biology grade. For experiments involving TNF treatment, the EGF was removed from the medium 16 h prior to addition of TNF. For cell growth assays, fresh medium with reduced serum (0.1%) supplemented with or without treatments was provided daily. Growth assays were conducted in 35-mm dishes, and cell density was evaluated after 3 days using an automated cell counter. Viability was checked by trypan blue exclusion. Cell Migration—Cell migration assays were performed using a modified Boyden chamber containing polycarbonate membrane Transwell inserts (10-μm thickness, 8-μm pore size, Costar). The lower side of the membrane was coated with 10 μl of collagen type I (10 μg/ml), and inserts were placed into 24-well culture plates. Cells (4 × 104) were allowed to attach to the upper side of the membrane and then provided treatment medium for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified air atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After removing non-migrating cells from the upper surface using a cotton swab, cells that migrated to the lower chamber were stained with SyberGreen (Molecular Probes), and green fluorescence intensity was measured using a microtiter plate reader (485 excitation; 530 emission). Calibration experiments (not shown) were conducted to ensure the assay was conducted under conditions where there was a linear relationship between the fluorescent intensity and the number of cells on the membrane. Triplicate Transwells were used for each assay, and each assay was repeated at least three times. Enzyme-linked Immunoassays—Levels of shed (soluble) TGFα in HMEC-conditioned medium were determined using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (R&D Diagnostics) according to the supplier's instructions. In addition to this commercial ELISA assay, a protein microarray ELISA employing antibodies against potential serum markers for human cancer was used to measure proteins released into medium from HMECs, based on a previously described technique (23Woodbury R.L. Varnum S.M. Zangar R.C. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 233-237Google Scholar). Individual “sandwich ELISAs” were developed for 21 different proteins, which were selected based on literature reports that the average levels of the protein were altered in cancer patients compared with a control group. In brief, capture antibodies were printed onto and covalently linked to glass slides in ∼150-μm diameter spots, as described previously (23Woodbury R.L. Varnum S.M. Zangar R.C. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 233-237Google Scholar). Each capture antibody was printed in quadruplicate on each array. The slides were then incubated with cell culture medium or a mixture of protein standards prior to exposure to washing and exposure to a biotinylated capture antibody. The biotin levels were amplified using a tyramide amplification system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) prior to incubation with Cy3-cojungated streptavidin. Spot fluorescence was then determined using a ScanArray 5000 laser scanner. Each of the 2-liter ELISA assays on the microarray was developed individually, and assay conditions were optimized based on reported concentrations of that particular marker in serum. To obtain quantitative measures of each protein, a series of standards was analyzed in parallel to the analysis of cell culture medium. This was undertaken by preparing a mixture of all 2-liter purified proteins that was serially diluted 3-fold to generate a set of seven standards. Standards were prepared in the same solution as used for the culture medium samples (see below). Each dilution of the standard mixture was analyzed in duplicate using individual arrays on different slides. Prior to analysis, cell culture supernatants were diluted 2-fold in blocking buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% blocking reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Although the assay provided quantitative data for 16 proteins, the concentrations of 5 proteins in cell culture medium were outside the range of the series of standards. For each treatment, culture medium from three dishes was collected, and each sample was analyzed on two arrays that were printed on separate glass slides. Gelatin Zymography—The presence of secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9 in HMEC-conditioned medium was analyzed by gelatin zymography (24Hibbs M.S. Hasty K.A. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Mainardi C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2493-2500Google Scholar). HMECs were exposed to TNF, with or without additional inhibitors in serum-free and EGF-free medium. After 24 h, conditioned medium was collected and concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Millipore), and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The volumes loaded were normalized to account for differences in cell number. After electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by 24 h in Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.5). After staining with Coomassie Blue, the gels were cleared, and images obtained using a chemiluminescent imager in bright field transmission mode. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—Total or active MAPK proteins were measured by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies that recognize total p44 (ERK1) and p42 (ERK2) MAPK or dually phosphorylated specific MAPK protein (Promega) as previously described (25Mounho B.J. Thrall B.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 159: 125-133Google Scholar). Secreted MMP-9 protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis of HMEC-conditioned medium using procedures described for gelatin zymography, and detection was accomplished with a mouse monoclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (R&D Systems) and a chemiluminescent imager (LumiImager, Roche Applied Science). For analysis of EGFR phosphorylation, total EGFR was immunoprecipitated by incubation of whole cell lysates (200 μg) with 225 mAbs conjugated to streptavidin beads for 15 min at 4 °C, and the immunocomplexes were isolated using an avidin column. After gently washing, the protein was eluted in buffer containing 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 8 m urea, and equivalent amounts of protein were analyzed for phosphorylation status by Western blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and chemiluminescence detection. TNF-stimulated HMEC Growth and Motility Involves EGFR—It has previously been reported that, unlike mammary cancer cells, non-transformed mammary cells are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of TNF (4Dollbaum C. Creasey A.A. Dairkee S.H. Hiller A.J. Rudolph A.R. Lin L. Vitt C. Smith H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4740-4744Google Scholar, 5Mueller H. Flury N. Liu R. Scheidegger S. Eppenberger U. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 2312-2318Google Scholar). Consistent with this previous work, we found that low concentrations of TNF were not only non-cytotoxic to HMECs but actually stimulated cell survival and growth after several days in minimal medium (Fig. 1A). In the absence of EGF or additional added growth factors, TNF concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/ml caused a quantifiable increase in cell density over 3 days in culture as compared with medium lacking TNF. Routinely, we found that maximal stimulation of HMEC growth was achieved at concentrations ranging between 5 and 10 ng/ml TNF. At these low concentrations of cytokine, no evidence for induction of apoptosis was observed, as evaluated by nuclear morphology and trypan blue exclusion tests (results not shown). To investigate the potential role of EGFR signaling in the growth stimulatory effects of TNF, cell growth assays were conducted in the presence and absence of a potent and specific inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, PD153035 (PD, Fig. 1B). PD153035 selectively inhibits EGFR kinase activation at nanomolar concentrations, whereas inhibition of related tyrosine kinases requires micromolar or higher concentrations (26Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Google Scholar). By Western blot analysis, we verified that the concentrations of PD153035 used in these experiments blocked phosphorylation of EGFR induced by EGF treatment (results not shown and Fig. 4). The results shown in Fig. 1B demonstrate that cell numbers were increased over 2-fold by 5 ng/ml TNF treatment, an increase comparable to that achieved by treatment with EGF (1 ng/ml). In the presence of the EGFR kinase inhibitor, however, TNF was ineffective and resulted in cell densities similar to untreated control cultures. As expected, a similar suppression of EGF-induced growth was achieved with PD153035 (Fig. 1B). In addition, TNF-induced cell growth was inhibited by co-treatment with a neutralizing antibody (225 mAb) (Fig. 1B), which blocks EGFR ligand binding (27Gill G.N. Kawamoto T. Cochet C. Le A. Sato J.D. Masui H. McLeod C. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7755-7760Google Scholar), suggesting that, even in the absence of added EGFR ligands, the apparent proliferative effects of TNF in HMECs are dependent on EGFR signaling. HMECs constitutively produce EGFR ligands that, when released into the extracellular environment by regulated proteolysis, stimulate the receptor in an autocrine manner. A tight correlation between the proteolytic release of EGFR ligands and growth of HMECs has been demonstrated (28Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Google Scholar, 29DeWitt A.E. Dong J.Y. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2301-2313Google Scholar). In particular, the hydroxamate-based metalloprotease inhibitor, batimastat, has been shown to reduce HMEC mitogenesis in direct proportion to its ability to inhibit endogenous TGFα release (28Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that if the mechanism of cross-talk between TNF and EGFR requires proteolytic release of EGFR ligands, batimastat should block the ability of TNF to stimulate HMEC growth. In support of this hypothesis, we found that treatment with batimastat inhibited TNF-induced growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). Relatively low concentrations of batimastat (0.1 μm) were sufficient to inhibit TNF-induced HMEC growth, demonstrating that the growth stimulatory effects of exogenous TNF are dependent on metalloprotease activity. Interestingly, with increasing concentrations of batimastat, cell growth could be reduced below untreated control levels, suggesting that in addition to TNF-inducible pathways, constitutive metalloprotease-dependent pathways are active in HMECs and contribute to basal cell growth rates. In the absence of exogenous growth factors, HMECs grow as compact colonies of cells, suggesting a low level of migratory behavior (Fig. 2). During our initial experiments we observed a scattering effect in HMEC cultures exposed to low levels of TNF, suggesting that this cytokine might also stimulate HMEC motility. To determine whether TNF-induced cell motility involved EGFR signaling, we investigated the effect of co-treatment with EGFR-neutralizing antibody on the pattern of cell growth in the presence and absence of TNF. As shown in Fig. 2A, cell scattering induced by TNF was eliminated when 225 mAb was included as a co-treatment. In contrast, the increase in cell motility induced by TNF was not affected by addition of an unrelated IgG control antibody, indicating the effects observed specifically involve EGFR (Fig. 2A). Additional experiments showed that, like 225 mAb, co-treatment with PD153035 suppressed cell scattering by TNF (Fig. 2B). We also investigated whether TNF-induced cell motility was dependent on metalloprotease activity, as it was in the case of cell growth. As shown in Fig. 2B, TNF increased cell scattering, but co-treatment with batimastat resulted in the same compact colony-like pattern of growth observed in the absence of TNF. To evaluate the cell migration response quantitatively, a modified Boyden chamber assay was used to measure the fraction of cells that migrated across a collagen matrix in response to TNF or co-treatments. As is summarized in Fig. 3, TNF treatment (4 h) increased the number of cells that migrated across a collagen matrix 2-fold compared with untreated controls (Fig. 3). Co-treatment with batimastat completely inhibited TNF-induced migration. Similarly, TNF-induced migration was inhibited by PD153035 co-treatment (Fig. 3). These results corroborate the microscopy observations and suggest that the scattered cell formations are a consequence of TNF-induced stimulation of cell motility. In addition, both EGFR kinase activation and metalloprotease activity are necessary for TNF-induced HMEC migration. EGFR Transactivation—To demonstrate that exposure to TNF results in secondary activation (transactivation) of EGFR, we examined EGFR phosphorylation status after TNF treatment. Western blot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed a protein that co-migrated with EGFR and showed a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation after exposure to TNF (Fig. 4A). This protein band was further confirmed to be EGFR, because co-treatment with PD153035 completely eliminated the phosphorylation response (Fig. 4A). EGFR were also immunoprecipitated following longer TNF exposure times. As shown in Fig. 4B, TNF treatment for 60 min significantly increased EGFR phosphorylation. Furthermore, this response was inhibited by batimastat, indicating secondary activation of EGFR by TNF is dependent on metalloprotease activity. As a control, the effect of batimastat on EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation was also measured. In contrast to the transactivation response induced by TNF, direct activation of EGFR by EGF was not inhibited by co-treatment with batimastat. Release of Extracellular Proteins in Response to TNF—The results of Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 indicate that the effects of TNF on HMEC proliferation and motility involve metalloprotease activation and the extracellular release of proteins involved in stimulation of EGFR and regulation of cell migration. Thus, it was important to determine the proteins whose secretion or shedding could be induced by TNF. To identify candidate proteins, we used a protein microarray ELISA utilizing antibodies against 21 potential serum markers for human mammary cancer. This microarray ELISA has been described recently by Woodbury et al. (23Woodbury R.L. Varnum S.M. Zangar R.C. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 233-237Google Scholar). In addition to untreated control supernatants, conditioned medium from TNF-treated cells and cells treated with TNF combined with EGFR-neutralizing antibody were analyzed. Among the putative mammary cancer markers included in this assay, 16 proteins were detected in HMEC-conditioned medium. Furthermore, the release of several of these proteins was stimulated by TNF treatment, and in some cases this release was EGFR-dependent. A summary of the results most relevant to this study is shown in Fig. 5. The cancer marker CA15-3 (also known as MUC1 mucin) and RANTES displayed an increased net release after TNF treatment. These results are consistent with previous studies showing TNF regulates the production and release of these proteins in other epithelial cell types (30Fukagawa K. Saito H. Tsubota K. Shimmura S. Tachimoto H. Akasawa A. Oguchi Y. Cornea. 1997; 16: 564-570Google Scholar, 31Lagow E.L. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 759-772Google Scholar). TNF-induced release of CA15-3 and RANTES was unaffected by the presence of 225 mAb, indicating this response was independent of EGFR signaling. In contrast, extracellular levels of the metalloprotease MMP-9 and platelet-derived growth factor (A-chain) were increased by TNF treatment, but addition of 225 mAb significantly reduced the release of these proteins. In the case of TGFα production, an endogenous ligand for EGFR, co-treatment with 225 mAb significantly enhanced its level, probably by preventing its uptake and degradation by cells (29DeWitt A.E. Dong J.Y. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2301-2313Google Scholar). The release of other marker proteins, including PDGF-B (Fig. 5), basic fibroblast growth factor, HER-2, sICAM-1, and hepatocyte growth factor (results not shown) was not significantly affected by any treatment, indicating that the TNF-mediated responses as well as the ability of 225 mAb to modulate these responses were specific to a subclass of released proteins. The microarray ELISA provided a rapid means of screening potential proteins shed or secreted in response to TNF in HMECs. Of particular interest are those proteins whose extracellular release, in collaboration with EGFR signaling pathways, could contribute to the migratory phenotype induced by TNF. Therefore, additional experiments focused on using independent methods to verify the microarray ELISA results obtained for TGFα and MMP-9. Among the EGFR ligands expressed in HMECs, TGFα has been shown to signal through autocrine mechanisms (28Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Google Scholar, 29DeWitt A.E. Dong J.Y. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2301-2313Google Scholar). Autocrine presentation of EGFR ligands is thought to provide a spatially restricted signal that directs HMEC migration (32Maheshwari G. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1123-1128Google Scholar). Using an independent commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay to measure levels of soluble TGFα in HMEC-conditioned medium, we could not detect an increase in TGFα levels over control levels following treatment with TNF alone (Fig. 6). However, when the 225 mAb was added to prevent EGFR utilization of the ligand, levels of extracellular TGFα accumulated with increasing concentrations of TNF (Fig. 6). These results not only confirmed the microarray ELISA results but clearly demonstrated that shedding of TGFα occurs in a TNF concentration-dependent manner. Activation and release of MMP-9 is thought to play an important role in mammary cancer and invasion (33Chang C. Werb Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S37-S43Abstract Full Text PDF Google"
https://openalex.org/W1967954343,"BAG-1 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1) proteins interact with the HSC70 and HSP70 heat shock proteins and have been proposed to promote cell survival by coordinating the function of these chaperones with the proteasome to facilitate protein degradation. Consistent with this proposal, previous analyses in cancer cells have demonstrated that BAG-1 requires protein domains important for HSC70/HSP70 and proteasome binding in order to interfere with the growth inhibition induced by heat shock (Townsend, P. A., Cutress, R. I., Sharp, A., Brimmell, M., and Packham, G. (2003) Cancer Res., 63, 4150–4157). Moreover, cellular stress triggered the relocalization of the cytoplasmic BAG-1S (∼36 kDa) isoform to the nucleus, and both BAG-1S and the constitutively nuclear localized BAG-1L (∼50 kDa) isoform suppressed heat shock-induced apoptosis to the same extent, suggesting a critical role in the nucleus. Because ischemia (I) and reperfusion (R) are important stress signals in acute and chronic heart disease, we have examined the expression and function of BAG-1 proteins in primary cardiac myocytes (CMs) and the Langendorff-perfused intact heart. The expression of both BAG-1 isoforms, BAG-1S and BAG-1L, was rapidly induced following ischemia in rat CM, and this was maintained during subsequent reperfusion. In control hearts, BAG-1S and BAG-1L were readily detectable in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. However, BAG-1S did not relocate to the nucleus following simulated I/R. BAG-1 interacted with both RAF-1 and HSC70 in CMs and the whole heart, and binding to HSC70 was increased following I/R. Overexpression of the human BAG-1S and BAG-1 M isoforms significantly reduced CM apoptosis following simulated I/R. By contrast, BAG-1L or BAG-1S fused to a heterologous nuclear localization sequence failed to protect CM. Finally, overexpression of BAG-1 deletion and point mutants unable to bind HSC70/HSP70 failed to offer cardioprotection. Surprisingly, a deletion mutant lacking the N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, which mediates interaction with the proteasome, still promoted cardioprotection. Therefore, BAG-1 has a novel cardioprotective role, mediated via association with HSC70/HSP70, which is critical upon cytoplasmic localization but independent of the BAG-1 ubiquitin-like domain. Our studies demonstrate that BAG-1 can influence cellular response to stress by multiple mechanisms, potentially influenced by the cell type and nature of the stress signal.

Cells express multiple BAG-1 isoforms through alternate translation initiation of a single mRNA. In human cells, BAG-1S (∼36 kDa) is preferentially localized in the cytoplasm, whereas BAG-1L, the largest isoform (∼50 kDa), contains an N-terminal nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and is generally localized in the nucleus. A 46-kDa isoform, BAG-1M, partitions itself between the nucleus and the cytoplasm but is not expressed in some other species. BAG-1 isoforms are generated by alternate translation of a single mRNA, and BAG-1S translation is at least partially mediated via an internal ribosome entry segment (4Coldwell M.J. deSchoolmeester M.L. Fraser G.A. Pickering B.M. Packham G. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4095-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). BAG-1 isoforms contain various domains, including repeats rich in acidic amino acid residues, an ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), and a C-terminal evolutionarily conserved “BAG” domain. The ULD is required for interaction with the proteasome, the major non-lysozymal proteolytic complex in cells (5Luders J. Demand J. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 6Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Hohfeld J. Curr.

A. 1996; 93: 7063-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). BAG-1 modulates the chaperone activity of HSC70/HSP70, and BAG-1 has been proposed to link these heat shock proteins to the proteasome to facilitate protein degradation (5Luders J. Demand J. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, chaperone function is required for some ubiquitination reactions (5Luders J. Demand J. Hohfeld J. J. Biol.

Alberti S. Patterson C. Hohfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which BAG-1 promotes cell survival have been studied most intensively in cancer cell lines. Consistent with the model in which BAG-1 may facilitate protein turnover, we have recently demonstrated that suppression of stress-induced growth inhibition by BAG-1 in breast cancer cells requires specific amino acid residues within the BAG domain required for interaction with HSC70/HSP70 and the ULD (13Townsend P.A. Cutress R.I. Sharp A. Brimmell M. Packham G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4150-4157PubMed Google Scholar). Although they were differentially localized in cells, all BAG-1 isoforms were equally effective in suppressing heat shock-induced growth inhibition. However, cellular stress promoted the nuclear accumulation of BAG-1 isoforms and chaperones, indicating that protection from apoptosis in these systems is dependent on a nuclear function of BAG-1. It is important to note that function and expression of chaperones and activity of the proteasome are frequently altered in malignant cells (14Whitesell L. Bagatell R. Falsey R. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, these interactions might be particularly relevant in the setting of malignant disease; however, the function of BAG-1 has not been studied in non-transformed cells. There are alternate mechanisms by which BAG-1 might promote cell survival. For example, the BAG domain of BAG-1 also mediates interaction with the RAF-1 kinase, and BAG-1 stimulates RAF-1 kinase activity independent of RAS. The binding of RAF-1 and chaperones is competitive, and in hamster fibroblasts elevated levels of HSP70 associated with cellular stress sequester BAG-1, leading to a decrease in RAF-1 activity. Thus, BAG-1 may function to coordinate cell growth signals following cellular stress (9Song J. Takeda M. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, the significance of RAF-1 for BAG-1-mediated survival remains unclear. It is possible that BAG-1 may promote cell survival by stimulating RAF-1 dependent anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. Alternately, RAF-1 is also important for cell proliferation, and elevated levels of chaperones might therefore protect cells from apoptosis by allowing cells to accumulate in a less proliferative, apoptosis-prone state by interfering with the activation of RAF-1 via BAG-1. Chronic and acute heart diseases are major health problems in the Western world, accounting for one-fifth of the total deaths worldwide, and are responsible for nearly one million deaths per year in the United States and 240,000 in the United Kingdom (15American Heart AssociationHeart Disease and Stroke Statistics, 2003 Update.

Apoptosis has become increasingly recognized as one of the mechanisms of cell death during injury following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in the heart (17Fliss H. Gattinger D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). In human studies, apoptosis has been observed in the infarcted region of the heart following acute myocardial infarction (18Olivetti G. Quaini F. Sala R. Lagrasta C. Corradi D. Bonacina E. Gambert S.R. Cigola E. Anversa P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2005-2016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and activated caspases have been identified in the intact heart and from cultured cardiac myocytes following I/R injury (19Black S.C.

Although extensive necrosis is frequently observed in diseased heart, it is thought to arise subsequent to apoptosis, i.e. secondary necrosis. Existing therapies provide some protection for the ischemic myocardium against cell loss and functional impairment, but this protection is partial. The development of more effective strategies to maintain myocardial cell survival in ischemic heart disease remains a major goal. A detailed knowledge of the role of the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins that modulate cardiac myocyte cell death will provide further understanding of the pathology of severe heart failure at the molecular level and provide new insights in to novel anti-apoptotic therapies. Here we demonstrate that BAG-1 has a novel cytoprotective role in the heart, decreasing apoptosis in primary cardiac myocytes following simulated I/R. In contrast to previous studies, in breast cancer cells only BAG-1S suppressed apoptosis, and this was dependent on its cytoplasmic localization. Interestingly, as in other cells, BAG-1 function required amino acid residues important for interaction with HSC70/HSP70, but, unlike other systems, BAG-1-mediated cardioprotection does not require the ULD, suggesting a novel mechanism of action that is independent of the proteasome. I/R of Primary Neonatal Cardiac Myocytes—Ventricular cardiac myocytes (CMs) were isolated from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats <2 days old and cultured as described previously (20Scarabelli T.M.

Cultures consisted of >95% myocytes as determined by indirect staining with a monoclonal mouse antibody to desmin. For simulation of ischemia, the medium of cells was replaced with modified Esumi ischemic buffer (137 mm NaCl, 12 mm KCl, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl·2H2O, 4 mm HEPES, 10 mm deoxyglucose, and 20 mm sodium lactate, pH 6.2). This buffer has a high potassium content and a low acidic pH and, hence, mimics the conditions of cells within the heart when exposed to oxygen deprivation (22Esumi K. Nishida M. Shaw D. Smith T.W. Marsh J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H1743-H1752PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were transferred to a sealed chamber in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% argon for induction of hypoxia and maintained at 37 °C for 4 h. Untreated cells were cultured in Esumi control buffer (137 mm NaCl, 3.8 mm KCl, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl·2H2O, 4 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 21% O2 at 37 °C for 4 h. After completion of the hypoxic treatment, the cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, normal medium was added, and the cells were returned to a standard incubator for a further 4 or 24 h of reoxygenation to simulate reperfusion (23Davidson S.M.

Animal Model—Hearts from anesthetized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were mounted in a Langendorff perfusion apparatus and simulated I/R performed as described previously (20Scarabelli T.M. Stephanou A. Pasini E. Comini L. Raddino R. Knight R.A. Latchman D.S. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Isolated hearts were divided into two groups. Treated hearts were exposed to 30 min of regional ischemia achieved by occlusion of the left coronary artery, and subsequently reperfused for 2 h. Control hearts were continuously perfused for 2 h. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitations—For Western blotting, primary CMs were lysed in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH8, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors. For immunoprecipitations, cells or tissue were lysed following standard protocols, and BAG-1 was precipitated overnight at 4 °C (24Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). For the experiments with HEK293 cells, which were used to model the BAG-1 domain helix mutants and their effects upon binding to chaperones, the cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. When required, 5 × 106 cells were transfected for 24 h with 12.5 μg of DNA using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio (v/v) of 3:1. Western blotting was performed following standard protocols with equal amounts of protein loaded for each sample (23Davidson S.M. Stephanou A. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Fractionation—Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were obtained by hypotonic lysis and differential centrifugation (25Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem.

Western blotting for PCNA and GAPDH were further used to verify the purity of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. Expression Constructs—Optimized human BAG-1S, -1M, and -1L expression constructs and expression constructs for the BAG-1S deletion mutants BAG-1S-(1–155) and BAG-1S-(89–230), the BAG-1S point mutant BAG-1S-(K80A), and BAG-1S fused to an heterologous NLS (NLS-BAG-1S) were generated by PCR and are described elsewhere (13Townsend P.A.

The BAG domain helix point mutants BAG-1S-(E112A/K116A) (helix 1; H1), BAG-1S-(Q169A/K172A) (helix 2; H2), and BAG-1S-(Q201A/D208A/Q212A) (helix 3; H3) were generated using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) and the primers described as follows, with the mutated codons underlined: H1, 5′-GAACAGTCCACAGGAAGCGG TTGAACTAGCGAAGTTGAAACATTTGG-3′ (top) and 5′-CCAAATGTTTCAACTTCGCTAGTTCAACCGCTTCCTGTGGACTGTTC-3′ (bottom); H2, 5′-GGAGAGTAAAAGCCACAATAGCGCAGTTTATGGCGATCTTGGAGGAG-3′ (top) and 5′-CTCCTCCAAGATCGCCATAAACTGCGCTATTGTGGCTTTTACTCTCC-3′ (bottom); H3-1, 5′-GGCTTGGTAAAAAAGGTTGCGGCATTCCTAGCCGAGTG-3′ (top) and 5′-CACTCGGCTAGGAATGCCGCAACCTTTTTTACCAAGCC-3′ (bottom); H3-2, 5′-GCCAGTGTGCCACAGTGGAGGCGAACATCTGCCAGG-3′ (top) and 5′-CCTGGCAGATGTTCGCCTCCACTGTGGCACACTCGGC-3′ (bottom). Cardiac Myocyte Apoptosis Assay—Cardiac myocytes were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were cotransfected with BAG-1 expression construct or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as a control, and an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression construct, pN1-EGFP (Clontech), was used to label transfected cells (typically 10% transfected cells). To determine levels of apoptosis, cells were fixed in 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for 30 min at 25 °C and analyzed using the TUNEL assay with rhodamine-conjugated dUTP (Roche Applied Science) (20Scarabelli T.M. Stephanou A. Pasini E. Comini L. Raddino R. Knight R.A. Latchman D.S. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Davidson S.M. Stephanou A. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1359-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed immediately following 4 h of ischemia or after 4 h of ischemia and 16 h of subsequent reperfusion, and untreated cells were analyzed as a control. Cells were counterstained with propidium iodide. The percentage of apoptotic nuclei was expressed as a percentage of total EGFP positive nuclei by scoring at least 200 cells 3× per sample view. Six random fields per well of cells were counted. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for each group of treatments, and differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Differences among means were compared within the treatment groups using Student's t test. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the data were expressed as means ± S.E. of all fields counted from one representative experiment, i.e. six fields. Effect of Simulated I/R on BAG-1 Expression and Localization in Vitro and in Vivo—We first used Western blotting to determine the effects of simulated I/R on BAG-1 expression in vitro using primary cultures of neonatal rat CMs (Fig. 1a). Cells were subjected to ischemia by incubation for 4 h in ischemic buffer and an atmosphere lacking oxygen. I/R was simulated by subsequently growing cells in a normoxic environment for 4 or 24 h. Rat CMs expressed only the BAG-1L and BAG-1S isoforms, and both proteins were significantly (p < 0.01) increased following simulated ischemia (Fig. 1a). BAG-1L expression was increased (4.2 ± 0.39-fold), and BAG-1S expression was also increased (3.1 ± 0.27-fold) compared with untreated cells (mean of three separate experiments ±S.E.). Expression was not modulated further during subsequent reperfusion. To confirm these findings, similar studies were performed using isolated hearts analyzed on the Langendorff perfusion apparatus (Fig. 1b). Expression of both BAG-1 isoforms was also increased in vivo following simulated I/R in intact hearts. Here, BAG-1L expression was increased (3.9 ± 0.31-fold), and BAG-1S expression was also increased (4.6 ± 0.50-fold) compared with control hearts (mean of three separate experiments ± S.E.). BAG-1 isoforms are differentially localized in the cell (1Takayama S. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E237-E241Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 2Tang S.C. IUBMB. Life. 2002; 53: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3Townsend P.A. Cutress R.I. Sharp A. Brimmell M. Packham G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and we examined the localization of BAG-1S and BAG-1L in cells exposed to simulated I/R. In control CMs, BAG-1S and -1L were detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 1c). However, quantitation of the immunoblots demonstrated that BAG-1L was 2.9 ± 0.3 times more abundant in the nucleus relative to the cytoplasm. After 4 h of reperfusion, BAG-1L was 5.3 ± 0.5 more abundant in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm and was undetectable in the cytoplasm 24 h after reperfusion. Therefore, in addition to increased expression, there is a relative relocalization of BAG-1L from the cytoplasm to the nucleus so that, at 24 h post-reperfusion, BAG-1L is only present in the nucleus. However, this occurs subsequent to increases in expression, because BAG-1L expression was increased to the same extent in the cytoplasm and nucleus following simulated ischemia alone. In contrast to BAG-1L, BAG-1S was equally distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm in control cells, and its relative distribution was only modestly altered (1.5-fold relative increase in nuclear abundance) following ischemia or I/R. Western blotting for PCNA and GAPDH verified the purity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Therefore, ischemia modulates both the expression and localization of BAG-1 isoforms. However, whereas expression is rapid and maximally induced within 4 h of reperfusion, relocalization of BAG-1L to the nucleus occurs over a longer time frame. Assessment of BAG-1-Mediated Cardioprotection, a Requirement for Cytoplasmic Expression—To determine the importance of elevated BAG-1 expression following I/R, we analyzed the effects of enforced BAG-1 expression on CM apoptosis following simulated ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (Fig. 2). CMs were transfected with expression constructs engineered to specifically overexpress one of the three human BAG-1 isoforms, BAG-1S, -1M, or -1L, at approximately equivalent levels (13Townsend P.A. Cutress R.I. Sharp A. Brimmell M. Packham G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4150-4157PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cutress R.I. Townsend P.A. Sharp A. Maison A. Wood L. Lee R. Brimmell M. Mullee M.A. Johnson P.W. Royle G.T. Bateman A.C. Packham G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An EGFP expression construct was cotransfected to identify transfected cells, and apoptosis was measured by TUNEL in untreated cells, immediately following 4 h of simulated ischemia or 16 h of reperfusion. In control cells, the proportion of TUNEL positive cells was 9.1 ± 2.2%. Apoptosis was significantly increased following both simulated ischemia and I/R for 24.2 ± 5.0% (p < 0.05 compared with control cells) and 41.3 ± 3.3% (p < 0.001 compared with control cells) of TUNEL-positive cells, respectively. Overexpression of either human BAG-1S or BAG-1M reduced the amount of apoptosis in transfected CM following simulated I/R compared with pcDNA3-transfected cells (22.5 ± 3.1% and 23.5 ± 3.5% respectively; p < 0.001 for both). By contrast, BAG-1L expression did not decrease the percentage of TUNEL-positive myocytes compared with pcDNA-transfected cells (44.0 ± 6%; p > 0.05). Therefore, BAG-1S and BAG-1M, but not BAG-1L, were protective in CM cells following simulated I/R. Although there was a trend for reduced apoptosis following ischemia alone in cells overexpressing BAG-1S or BAG-1M, this failed to reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). However, because the overall levels of apoptosis following ischemia alone are lower than they are following I/R, it is not clear whether this represents a failure to suppress apoptosis under these conditions or that it is more difficult to show a statistically significant change when apoptosis levels are low. Simulated I/R induced only very low levels of CM necrosis, and this was not influenced by overexpression of BAG-1 (data not shown). We next investigated whether the subcellular distribution of BAG-1S played a significant role in cardioprotection by using a construct that expresses BAG-1S fused to a heterologous NLS (27Cutress R.I. Townsend P.A. Sharp A. Maison A. Wood L. Lee R. Brimmell M. Mullee M.A. Johnson P.W. Royle G.T. Bateman A.C. Packham G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similar to the case of endogenous BAG-1S, overexpressed BAG-1S was localized to both the CM cell nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas NLS-BAG-1, which was expressed at approximately equivalent levels, was localized entirely in the nucleus (data not shown, Ref. 27Cutress R.I. Townsend P.A. Sharp A. Maison A. Wood L. Lee R. Brimmell M. Mullee M.A. Johnson P.W. Royle G.T. Bateman A.C. Packham G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild type BAG-1S, NLS-BAG-1S did not prevent apoptosis in transfected CM (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the cytoplasmic localization of BAG-1S is essential for"

Soluble isoforms of other adhesion molecules and cytokine receptors have been proven to have significant agonist and antagonist effects on their full-length receptors; however, little is known about soluble CAR receptors. Using reverse transcription-PCR, we identified three CAR isoforms that lack the transmembrane domain and are the result of alternative RNA splicing events between exons IV and VII (CAR4/7), exons III and VII (CAR3/7), and exons II and VII (CAR2/7). The three CAR isoforms contain different regions of the extracellular domain of CAR and have C termini that are distinct from the full-length receptors. These alternatively spliced CAR proteins are released from transfected HeLa cells confirming that they are soluble proteins. In addition, the soluble CAR proteins are able to interact with the bacterially expressed extracellular domain of CAR. In addition, CAR4/7 but not CAR2/7 was found to bind to coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Each of the three soluble CAR isoforms is able to inhibit CVB3 infection of transfected HeLa cells.

Cell. 1993; 73: 309-319Google Scholar). CAR is a glycoprotein composed of two extracellular immunoglobulin domains, a single hydrophobic α-helical transmembrane domain, and an intracellular region (8Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Krithivas A. Hong J.S. Horwitz M.S. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1320-1323Google Scholar). The human CAR gene composed of at least eight exons is located on chromosome 21q11.2 (9Bowles K.R. Gibson J. Wu J. Shaffer L.G. Towbin J.A. Bowles N.E. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 354-359Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of CAR is encoded by exons I–VI, whereas the cytosolic region of hCAR1 is encoded by exon VII. A second membranous CAR isoform, hCAR2, is produced by alternative RNA splicing between an internal splicing site of exon VII and exon VIII (10Chen J.W. Ghosh R. Finberg R.W. Bergelson J.M. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 253-259Google Scholar). Although the structure of CAR is fairly well described, the function of CAR, apart from its role as a viral receptor, is only recently being defined. There is evidence that CAR acts as a homophilic adhesion protein and that it is involved in the morphogenesis and differentiation of heart and brain (11Tomko R.P. Johansson C.B. Totrov M. Abagyan R. Frisen J. Philipson L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 47-55Google Scholar, 12Honda T. Saitoh H. Masuko M. Katagiri-Abe T. Tominaga K. Kozakai I. Kobayashi K. Kumanishi T. Watanabe Y.G. Odani S. Kuwano R.

A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Google Scholar) described the colocalization of CAR with ZO-1 in epithelial tight junctions indicating that CAR is involved in the functional barrier to paracellular movement of macromolecules and ions. It has been shown that CAR expression is altered in several disease states. For example, myocardial CAR protein is increased in heart diseases (14Noutsias M. Fechner H. de Jonge H. Wang X. Dekkers D. Houtsmuller A.B. Pauschinger M. Bergelson J. Warraich R. Yacoub M. Hetzer R. Lamers J. Schultheiss H.P. Poller W. Circulation. 2001; 104: 275-280Google Scholar, 15Fechner H. Noutsias M. Tschoepe C.

Circulation. 2003; 107: 876-882Google Scholar), and a down-regulation of CAR expression in bladder cancer cells is associated with tumor growth (16Okegawa T. Pong R.C. Li Y. Bergelson J.M. Sagalowsky A.I. Hsieh J.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6592-6600Google Scholar). CAR belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (17Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Google Scholar). Members of this protein group are implicated in embryonic development, immune response, and cell-cell contact. Several also act as viral receptors (18Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 855-865Google Scholar). One of the characteristics of the immunoglobulin domain family is that many of the genes produce soluble receptors that lack the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the full-length receptor (19Fernandez-Botran R. Chilton P.M. Ma Y. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 63: 269-336Google Scholar). The soluble receptors are produced by proteolytic cleavage of the original membrane-bound receptor or by de novo synthesis from alternatively spliced RNAs that are specific for the soluble receptor (20Jones S.A. Horiuchi S. Topley N. Yamamoto N. Fuller G.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 43-58Google Scholar). The soluble receptors are released from the cell and appear in biological fluids or tissue culture supernatants (21Soldan S.S. Fogdell-Hahn A. Brennan M.B. Mittleman B.B. Ballerini C. Massacesi L. Seya T. McFarland H.F. Jacobson S. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 486-493Google Scholar). Because the ligand-binding site is highly conserved in the circulating receptors of different classes, they may act as antagonists in a manner similar to the soluble receptor of TNF-α that inhibits ligand binding to the membranous receptor (22Hale K.K. Smith C.G. Baker S.L. Vanderslice R.W. Squires C.H. Gleason T.M. Tucker K.K. Kohno T. Russell D.A. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 26-38Google Scholar), or they may act as agonists as occurs with the soluble interleukin-6 receptor that has a role in activation of interleukin-6-mediated signaling (23Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Google Scholar). Thus, the soluble receptors are involved in the regulation of the biological activity of the receptors and their ligands. Soluble receptors have been shown to play a significant role in various disorders, including heart disease (24Blankenberg S. Rupprecht H.J. Bickel C. Peetz D. Hafner G. Tiret L. Meyer J. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1336-1342Google Scholar), malignancies (25Haudenschild D. Moseley T. Rose L. Reddi A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4309-4316Google Scholar), and viral infection (26Nordoy I. Aukrust P. Muller F. Froland S.S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 81: 16-21Google Scholar). Accordingly, there is increasing interest in the understanding of the function of the receptors for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. Given the importance of CAR in viral infection, heart disease, and cancer, we have identified and analyzed three alternatively spliced isoforms of CAR that lack the transmembrane region. These proteins can be secreted from cells, bind to the extracellular CAR domain, and inhibit coxsackievirus infection in vitro. These results demonstrate that CAR not only acts as a virus receptor during coxsackievirus infection but that soluble isoforms of the receptor may have a role in the antiviral defense of the host. Western Blot Analysis—Protein was separated on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) under denaturing and reducing conditions and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Native gels were run omitting SDS and reducing agents from the buffer system. Western blot was performed under standard conditions using anti-VP1 antibody (DAKO Corp., Botany, Australia) or affinity-purified, polyclonal CAR-specific antibodies. The CAR antibody was generated by immunization of rabbits with bacterially expressed extracellular domain of murine CAR. Bound antibodies were detected either with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, nitroblue tetrazolium (Promega, Madison, WI). Detection of CAR Isoforms—1 μg of RNA extracted from HeLa cells was reverse transcribed with the SuperScript Amplification System (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with Elongase (Invitrogen), 5′-CATGGCGCTCCTGCTGTGCTTCGTGCTCCTGT-3′ as primer P5′ and 5′-AGGCTCTATACTATAGACCCAT-3′ as P3′(1Pauschinger M. Doerner A. Kuehl U. Schwimmbeck P.L. Poller W. Kandolf R. Schultheiss H.P. Circulation. 1999; 99: 889-895Google Scholar). PCR products were separated on a 1% low melting agarose gel, appropriate bands were excised, and CAR-specific sequences were re-amplified with P5′ and P3′(2Pauschinger M. Bowles N.E.

PCR products were treated with 5 units of Taq polymerase for 10 min at 72 °C and were then cloned into the pCDNA2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen). All PCR products were sequenced. Transfection—The coding sequences of human CAR2/7 (GenBank™ AY072910), CAR3/7 (GenBank™ AY072911), and CAR4/7 (AY072912), including their individual stop codons, were amplified by PCR using the corresponding plasmids that were produced as described above. Sequences were cloned between the EcoRI and XbaI site of the pEF6/V5-His A vector (Invitrogen). hCAR1 (GenBank™ Y07593), CAR2/7, and CAR4/7 were cloned together with a FLAG tag sequence into a modified pEF6/V5-His A vector (27Nakamura T.

Cells were harvested using a scraper 72 h after transfection, and protein was extracted. 150 μl of cell culture medium of the transfected cells was taken at the same time and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and washed with ether/ethanol. Precipitates were resolved in 30 μl of SDS page-gel loading buffer. Specimens of culture medium and transfected cells extract were analyzed by Western blotting. Expression and Purification of CAR-specific Proteins—The coding sequence of the extracellular domain of human CAR (GenBank™ Y07593) and CAR4/7 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the NheI and HindIII restriction sites of the bacterial expression vector pRSET (Invitrogen). His-tagged proteins were expressed in BL21 bacteria at 32 °C for 4 h, extracted in 8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 137 mm NaCl. Soluble CAR was separated from precipitated protein by centrifugation. Affinity Chromatography—A column of AminoLink Plus resin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) linked to the extracellular domain of human CAR was loaded with 500 μg of HeLa cell protein extract or 500 μl of cell culture medium from transfected HeLa cells containing CAR2/7, CAR3/7, or CAR4/7 protein and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The column was intensively washed with ice-cold lysis buffer and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, respectively, containing 250 mm NaCl and proteinase inhibitors. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, that were immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. Eluate was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ether/ethanol, and analyzed by Western blot using the CAR-specific antibody. The eluate from the affinity chromatography done with HeLa cell extract was additionally analyzed using antibodies against proteins not known to be associated with CAR, like the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), a highly expressed mitochondrial protein, and the elongation initiation factor (eIF4G). Immunoprecipitation—200 μl of culture medium containing FLAG-labeled CAR2/7 or CAR4/7 from transfected HeLa cells was incubated with 20 μl (3.3 × 108 pfu/ml) cesium gradient-purified coxsackievirus B3 for 1 h at 4 °C. Medium from untransfected HeLa cells was used as control. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 20 μl of agarose-coupled anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) in a total volume of 750 μl of PBS for 3 h at 4 °C. Precipitate was washed five times with PBS, 500 mm NaCl. Coprecipitation was analyzed by Western blot analysis using the anti-CAR or an anti-VP1 antibody (DAKO Corp., Botany, Australia). 100 ng of bacterially expressed and purified His-tagged CAR4/7 protein and 20 μl of CVB3 were incubated in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 0.6 μg of monoclonal anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and 25 μl of protein G in a total volume of 750 μl of PBS for 2 h at 4 °C under shaking. Reactions without an antibody were used as controls. Protein G pellets were washed five times with PBS, 500 mm NaCl, and analyzed by Western blotting. Coxsackievirus Inhibition Assay—Coxsackievirus B3 was derived from the infectious cDNA copy of the cardiotropic H3 strain of CVB3 (28Knowlton K.U. Jeon E.S. Berkley N. Wessely R. Huber S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7811-7818Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in 6-well culture dishes and transfected with human full-length CAR and CAR isoform-specific eukaryotic pEF6/V5-His A expression vectors. Cells transfected with the empty vector served as control. Cells were cultured for 48 h. Medium containing released CAR isoforms was retained or exchanged prior infection with 6 × 105 pfu of CVB3 for 30 min. Cells were fixed with 4% formamide after 6 h of infection. Infected cells were immunostained with a monoclonal anti-VP1 antibody (DAKO Corp.) and a biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described earlier (29Lee G.H. Badorff C. Knowlton K.U. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 489-495Google Scholar). Staining using only the secondary antibody gave no signal. The number of virus-infected cells in each of three fields of equal cell density was counted. The percentage of inhibition was calculated by the formula, (B - A)/B × 100%, where B is the average number of infected cells from the control, untransfected, cultured cells, and A is the average of infected cells from CAR or CAR isoform-transfected, cultured cells. Inhibition of Coxsackievirus Infection by Purified CAR Protein—80% confluent HeLa cells were treated with 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 nmol of bacterially expressed and purified exCAR or 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 nmol of CAR4/7 for 10 min at 37 °C and were subsequently infected with 6 × 105 pfu of CVB3 for 30 min. Virus was removed from the medium. Solution obtained following the extraction procedure using untransformed bacteria was used as a control. Cells were immunostained with a VP1 antibody (DAKO Corp.), and percent inhibition was calculated as described above. To determine the duration of the inhibitory effect of CAR4/7, HeLa cells were treated with 1.6 nmol of purified CAR4/7 or buffer (control) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and immediately infected with 6 × 105 pfu of CVB3 for 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min. Cells were grown for further 6 h, and infected cells were identified as described above. Grade of inhibition was calculated comparing CAR4/7-treated cells with their time-matched untreated controls. Identification of Alternatively Spliced CAR RNA—A previous publication has demonstrated distinct bands on Northern blots of HeLa cell RNA when probed with CAR cDNA (30Tomko R.P. Xu R. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3352-3356Google Scholar). To further analyze these CAR-related RNA we amplified CAR-specific sequences using primers located in exon I (P5′) and at the end of the coding sequence in exon VII (P3′(1Pauschinger M. Doerner A. Kuehl U. Schwimmbeck P.L. Poller W. Kandolf R. Schultheiss H.P. Circulation. 1999; 99: 889-895Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1B) from HeLa cell cDNA. RT-PCR resulted primarily in the amplification of the full-length CAR sequence with the expected length of 1104 bp (Fig. 1A, left panel, band a). PCR products from three smaller bands (bands b–d) were re-amplified with primer P5′ and P3′(2Pauschinger M. Bowles N.E. Fuentes-Garcia F.J. Pham V. Kuhl U. Schwimmbeck P.L. Schultheiss H.P. Towbin J.A. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1348-1354Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, right panel) and sequenced. The PCR product in lane b was the result of an alternative splicing event between exon IV and exon VII, eliminating exons V and VI. This product was designated as CAR4/7. PCR products in lanes c and d are results of alternative splicing between exons III and VII (CAR3/7) and between exons II and VII (CAR2/7), respectively. While these studies were in progress, Thoelen et al. (31Thoelen I. Magnusson C. Tagerud S. Polacek C. Lindberg M. VanRanst M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 216-222Google Scholar) reported the RT-PCR amplification of CAR2/7 and CAR4/7 and labeled the sequences γ-mRNA and β-mRNA of CAR, respectively. All of the alternatively spliced isoforms lack the transmembrane region encoded by exon VI but included the leader sequence that is primarily encoded by exon I. Different portions of immunoglobulin domains are represented in the alternatively spliced isoforms as shown in Fig. 1B. CAR4/7 contains immunoglobulin domain D1 and a part of immunoglobulin domain D2. CAR3/7 includes all of domain 1, and CAR2/7 contains only the first 70 amino acids of the extracellular region of full-length CAR. All splicing events identified result in a shift in the reading frame in exon VII compared with the full-length CAR. CAR4/7 and CAR3/7 have the same C termini as each other, whereas CAR2/7 is different than all of the others. Alternatively Spliced CAR Isoforms Are Soluble Receptors— Because all of the CAR isoforms contain the leader sequence but lack the transmembrane domain, we hypothesized that the alternatively spliced CAR isoforms could be released from the cell. To address this question, all three human CAR isoforms and FLAG-labeled full-length CAR were expressed in HeLa cells. Proteins in the cell extracts and the cell culture media were evaluated by immunoblot using an anti-CAR antibody. The endogenous full-length CAR, as well as transfected CAR proteins were present in HeLa cells (Fig. 2, left panel). In addition, the alternatively spliced isoforms were also detected in the culture media of the transfected cells (Fig. 2, right panel). The identity of the larger protein in the medium of CAR2/7-transfected cells is not clear but has the size of a CAR2/7 homodimer. However, transfected and endogenous full-length CAR was only found in the cell extract. These findings confirm the hypothesis that the CAR isoforms that lack the transmembrane domain are released from the transfected cell as soluble receptors. CAR Isoforms Bind to the Extracellular Domain of Human CAR Expressed and Isolated from Bacteria—An important characteristic of soluble receptors is their capability to modulate the interaction between the membranous receptor and its ligand by binding to one or both of them. A structural analysis has previously shown that the D1 domain of CAR is able to form an antiparallel homodimer (32van Raaij M.J. Chouin E. van der Z.H. Bergelson J.M. Cusack S. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1147-1155Google Scholar). To determine whether CAR isoforms interact with the extracellular domain of CAR (exCAR), human exCAR was expressed in bacteria, purified, and covalently bound to affinity chromatography resin. The purified exCAR showed a high degree of dimerization under native conditions and reduced significantly CVB3 infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A), indicating that its structure is intact. Affinity chromatography was performed with HeLa cell protein extract. Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 3B demonstrates that full-length CAR clearly bound to the exCAR-coupled column but did not interact with AminoLink resin in the absence of exCAR. To test the specificity of the affinity chromatography, peak fraction was also subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against proteins like ANT and eIF4G that are not known to interact with exCAR. None of these proteins were found in the eluted fraction. An example is for ANT in Fig. 3B. Medium containing native CAR2/7, CAR3/7, and CAR4/7, respectively, released from transfected HeLa cells was loaded to the column. A significant binding was detected for all CAR isoforms, whereas they did not interact with unlinked resin (Fig. 3C). Medium from untransfected cells did not show CAR antibody-reacting proteins with the size of the soluble CAR isoforms (data not shown). CAR4/7 but Not CAR2/7 Interacts with CVB3—Previous experiments have shown that the D1 domain of CAR interacts with coxsackievirus. Because the soluble CAR receptors contained at least a portion of D1, and because they bind to the exCAR, we hypothesized that soluble CAR proteins could also bind to CVB3. To address this question, CAR2/7 and CAR4/7 were expressed as FLAG-labeled proteins in HeLa cells and released into the medium. Purified CVB3 was added to the CAR isoform containing cell culture medium, and precipitation was performed with agarose-coupled anti-FLAG antibody. CAR2/7 and CAR4/7 were each detected in the precipitate and CVB3 coprecipitated with CAR4/7 (Fig. 4B) but not with CAR2/7 (Fig. 4A). Transfection of HeLa Cells with Soluble CAR Isoforms Inhibits CVB3 Infection—To prove the biological activity of the soluble CAR isoforms, we transfected HeLa cells with either full-length CAR or one of each of the CAR isoforms and analyzed their effect on CVB3 infection. The transfection efficiency for full-length CAR, CAR2/7, CAR3/7, and CAR4/7 (19.3 ± 0.8, 28.7 ± 5.8, 18.9 ± 4.0, and 27.1 ± 0.8% of all cells, respectively) was similar for all isoforms. The cell growth and viability were not negatively affected by the transfection. 48 h after transfection, cells were infected with CVB3 without changing the media that had been shown to contain the soluble CAR proteins. Overexpression of each of the alternatively spliced soluble CAR isoforms led to a significant inhibition of viral infection (Fig. 5A). The expression of full-length CAR did not significantly affect the efficiency of viral infection when compared with cells that were transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 5B). The elimination of CAR isoforms from the cell culture medium prior to CVB3 infection resulted in a consistent, but statistically insignificant reduction of the inhibitory effect of CAR3/7 and CAR4/7, whereas viral infection of CAR2/7-transfected cells was not changed. External Treatment with Recombinant CAR4/7 Protects HeLa Cells from CVB3 Infection—We further analyzed whether soluble CAR protein has an impact on viral infection when it is externally added to HeLa cells. For this purpose, CAR4/7 was bacterially expressed and purified. It was shown to dimerize, interact with the extracellular CAR domain in the exCAR-specific affinity chromatography, and coprecipitate with CVB3 during immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6, A–C). In addition, CAR4/7 was able to significantly reduce viral infection in a dose-dependent manner when externally added to the cell culture medium of untransfected HeLa cells before and during CVB3 incubation (Fig. 6D). However, the inhibitory effect was lost in a time-dependent manner when CAR4/7 was eliminated from the medium before CVB3 was added (Fig. 6E). Thus, binding of CAR4/7 to CVB3 and reversible extracellular contact of CAR4/7 to the cell surface are both likely to be mechanisms by which viral infection of the cells can be inhibited. These results demonstrate expression of three truncated CAR isoforms produced by alternative splicing. These CAR isoforms can be released from HeLa cells as soluble receptors. Importantly, soluble CAR proteins are able to bind to a bacterially expressed extracellular domain of CAR, and CAR4/7 but not CAR2/7 was found to interact with CVB3. In addition, soluble CAR isoforms showed biological activity inhibiting virus infection in vitro. Therefore, they fulfill typical characteristics of soluble receptors; i.e. binding to their membranous counterpart and/or to the ligand of the membrane receptor, thus affecting the function of the full-length CAR as a receptor for coxsackievirus. CAR gene produces a number of alternatively spliced mRNA resulting in protein products with considerable variability in the predicted protein structure. They include membrane-bound protein receptors with different cytoplasmic domains (33Fechner H. Haack A. Wang H. Wang X. Eizema K. Pauschinger M. Schoemaker R. Veghel R. Houtsmuller A. Schultheiss H.P. Lamers J. Poller W. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1520-1535Google Scholar), soluble proteins that preserve the majority of the extracellular domains of CAR, but have distinct C termini, and smaller polypeptides such as CAR2/7 that lack complete immunoglobulin domains and have a unique C-terminal sequence. Therefore, CAR meets a common feature of the immunoglobulin family to which it belongs: diversity produced by limited genetic material (34Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Google Scholar). We recognize that more alternatively spliced isoforms may exist, because 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis identified an additional splicing site in exon VII and an extra exon VIII with at least two more alternative splicing sites, which lies about 26 kb upstream from exon VII. 2A. Dörner, D. Xiong, K. Couch, T. Yajima, and K. U. Knowlton, unpublished data. Our experiments confirm the prediction that the alternatively spliced CAR isoforms are soluble receptors that can be released from the cell. Comparing the intracellular and extracellular amount of each transfected isoform (Fig. 2), CAR2/7 appears to be very efficiently released from the cell. Our observations fit a computer-based prediction (PSORT) that CAR2/7 is found in the extracellular compartment with a probability of 77.8%. An extracellular localization of 66.7% probability was predicted for CAR4/7 and 55.6% for CAR3/7. Signals for intracellular traffic have been identified in the C terminus of full-length CAR (35Cohen C.J. Gaetz J. Ohman T. Bergelson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25392-25398Google Scholar, 36van't Hof W. Crystal R.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6382-6386Google Scholar). CAR3/7 and CAR4/7 contain three dileucines in their C-terminal sequence that might belong to dileucine motifs that are involved in lysosomal sorting, endocytosis, and basolateral targeting (37Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 558-567Google Scholar). Dileucines are not found in the CAR2/7 sequence. Soluble receptors usually interact with their membranous receptor or with receptor ligands and in this way regulate the reactivity of their membranous counterparts. We were able to show that the soluble isoforms bind to the extracellular domain of CAR expressed in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography. These findings are consistent with structural analysis of immunoglobulin domain D1 of CAR demonstrating that they form antiparallel homodimers (32van Raaij M.J. Chouin E. van der Z.H. Bergelson J.M. Cusack S. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1147-1155Google Scholar), suggesting that CAR proteins may be important for cell-cell contact. CAR2/7 that has only the first 70 amino acids of the D1 domain is also able to interact with bacterially expressed exCAR. To what extent the various C termini of soluble receptors are involved in this interaction is not known. Even though CAR2/7 can bind to exCAR, it is not able to interact with CVB3. It has been shown that CAR uses different structural features within D1 for CVB3- and D1-D1 interaction. D1 is however fully conserved in the CAR4/7 isoform that was found to bind to exCAR and the virus (4He Y. Chipman P.R. Howitt J. Bator C.M. Whitt M.A. Baker T.S. Kuhn R.J. Anderson C.W. Freimuth P. Rossmann M.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 874-878Google Scholar, 32van Raaij M.J. Chouin E. van der Z.H. Bergelson J.M. Cusack S. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1147-1155Google Scholar). It is interesting that all of the described, soluble CAR isoforms protected transfected HeLa cells from CVB3 infection even though we could not demonstrate that CAR2/7 bound to CVB3. In the cases of CAR3/7 and CAR4/7, it is likely that binding of soluble CAR to the receptor and to the virus contributes to the inhibition. This is indicated in Fig. 6B wherein exchange of the CAR isoform-containing media had a small, but incomplete effect on viral infection. However, the elimination of CAR2/7 had no significant effect on viral inhibition, consistent with the fact that CAR2/7 does not bind to coxsackievirus. In addition, the inhibitory effect of CAR2/7 was slightly lower than that of CAR3/7 and CAR4/7 both of which should be able to bind to the receptor and the virus. Furthermore, bacterially expressed, purified CAR4/7 is able to inhibit virus infection when in the media and for a short time after CAR4/7 has been eliminated from the cell medium. Based on these data, our current model is that each of the CAR isoforms released from the cell can bind to the cell surface, likely through the membranous CAR and inhibit viral infection. In addition, an internal cellular effect of the soluble CAR isoforms blocking viral replication cannot be excluded. The inhibitory impact is, however, specific for the soluble form of CAR, because overexpression of membranous CAR did not appreciably affect CVB3 infection. The significance of soluble receptors in virus inhibition was recently supported by the observation that a CAR antibody-reacting protein of ∼31 kDa found in the malignant pleural effusions could inhibit adenovirus infection (38Bernal R.M. Sharma S. Gardner B.K. Douglas J.T. Bergelson J.M. Dubinett S.M. Batra R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 1915-1923Google Scholar). CAR was shown to be important in tight junction formation, and the CAR-mediated junctional barrier could be disrupted by the addition of the extracellular domain of CAR (13Cohen C.J. Shieh J.T. Pickles R.J. Okegawa T. Hsieh J.T. Bergelson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15191-15196Google Scholar). Adenovirus appears to use its knob protein similarly to disturb the intercellular CAR-CAR interaction in epithelia destabilizing the tissue integrity and facilitating the virus spreading (39Walters R.W. Freimuth P. Moninger T.O. Ganske I. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Cell. 2002; 110: 789-799Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that the soluble CAR isoforms may function as natural modulators of epithelial tissue permeability by influencing the intercellular interaction of their membranous counterpart. An elevated CAR expression has been seen in the subendothelial region of vessels in hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (14Noutsias M. Fechner H. de Jonge H. Wang X. Dekkers D. Houtsmuller A.B. Pauschinger M. Bergelson J. Warraich R. Yacoub M. Hetzer R. Lamers J. Schultheiss H.P. Poller W. Circulation. 2001; 104: 275-280Google Scholar). It is so far unclear whether this alteration is due to an increase in the membranous receptor and/or its soluble isoforms. In conclusion, CAR serves not only as a receptor for the virus, but expression of alternatively spliced isoforms of CAR may play a role in the antiviral defense system of the host and may have a regulatory effect on the membranous receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2050735517,"The tumor suppressor p53 regulates cellular responses to stress by serving in the nucleus to regulate transcription of genes involved in processes including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Nevertheless, recent papers show that p53 may have a separate cytoplasmic role in directly regulating the Bax-dependent mitochondrial pathway to cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2127476747,"Recent findings have shown that certain attributes of visual stimuli, like orientation, are registered in cortical areas when the stimulus is unresolvable or perceptually invisible; however, there is no evidence to show that complex forms of orientation processing (e.g., modulatory effects of orientation on the processing of other features) could occur in the absence of awareness. To address these questions, different psychophysical paradigms were designed in six experiments to probe unconscious orientation processing. First we demonstrated orientation-selective adaptation and color-contingent orientation adaptation for peripheral unresolvable Gabor patches. The next experiments showed the modulatory effects of perceptually indiscriminable orientations on apparent motion processing and attentional mechanisms. Finally we investigated disappearance patterns of unresolvable Gabor stimuli during motion-induced blindness (MIB). Abrupt changes in local unresolvable orientations truncated MIB; however, orientation-based grouping failed to affect the MIB pattern when the orientations were unresolvable. Overall results revealed that unresolvable orientations substantially influence perception at multiple levels."

The helical protrusion is thought to be substituted for the co-chaperonin GroES of a group I chaperonin and to be important for binding to unfolded proteins. Protease sensitivity assays and small angle x-ray scattering experiments were performed to demonstrate the conformation change of the wild type protein and the deletion mutants by adenine nucleotides. Whereas the binding of ATP to the wild type protein induced a structural transition corresponding to the closure of the built-in lid, it did not cause significant structural changes in deletion mutants. Although the mutants effectively protected proteins from thermal aggregation, ATP-dependent protein folding ability was remarkably diminished. We conclude that the helical protrusion is not necessarily important for binding to unfolded proteins, but its ATP-dependent conformational change mediates folding of captured unfolded proteins.

We conclude that the helical protrusion is not necessarily important for binding to unfolded proteins, but its ATP-dependent conformational change mediates folding of captured unfolded proteins. Protein folding is assisted by a number of molecular chaperones in vivo. The chaperonins, a ubiquitous class of molecular chaperones, form double ring complexes that mediate the folding of nascent and denatured proteins in an ATP-dependent manner (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Google Scholar). There are two distinct groups of chaperonins: (i) group I chaperonins of eubacteria and endosymbiotic organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts); and (ii) group II chaperonins of archaea (known as thermosome) and the eukaryotic cytoplasm (known as CCT 1The abbreviations used are: CCT, chaperonin-containing t-complex polypeptide-1; TRiC, TCP-1 ring complex; T.

Despite the relatively low sequence homology between the two groups, their domain architectures are very similar. Both of them are folded into three domains. The equatorial domain contains the ATP binding site and is involved in intra- and inter-ring contacts. The apical domain is involved in the binding to substrate proteins. The intermediate domain connects the equatorial and apical domains of each subunit and transfers the ATP-induced conformational changes from the equatorial to the apical domain (5Braig K. Ortwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Google Scholar, 6Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Google Scholar). The most striking structural difference between them is the lid of the central cavity of the chaperonin complex. The co-chaperonin GroES/cpn-10 serves as a lid for group I chaperonins in a heptameric dome-like structure. GroES/cpn-10 interacts with one or both GroEL rings in an ATP-regulated fashion, thereby sealing the cavity from the outside. It is demonstrated that a polypeptide of up to ∼57 kDa is able to fold within the GroES-sealed cavity (7Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is no GroES-like co-chaperonin for group II chaperonins. Instead, group II chaperonins have a built-in lid, which is composed of an extension of the apical domain called the helical protrusion. The helical protrusion is thought to play the equivalent role of GroES, sealing off the central cavity of the chaperonin complex (6Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O. Huber H. Huber R.

Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Maruyama T. Odaka M. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44959-44965Google Scholar). Furthermore, this region is assumed to be involved in substrate binding (6Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Google Scholar, 13Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Google Scholar). However, the exact role of the helical protrusion during the chaperonin functional cycle remains unclear. We have been studying the protein folding mechanism of group II chaperonins using the chaperonin from a hyperthermophilic archaeum, Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1. The natural chaperonin derived from T. KS-1 is a hetero-oligomer of α and β subunits, and the composition varies with the growth temperature (14Yoshida T. Ideno A. Hiyamuta S. Yohda M. Maruyama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1406-1413Google Scholar). In addition, each subunit forms a double ring homo-oligomer capable of ATP-dependent protein folding in vitro (10Yoshida T. Kawaguchi R. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Yohda M. Maruyama T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 73-85Google Scholar). In this study, we constructed helical protrusion deletion mutants of T. KS-1 α chaperonin (termed αDel I, αDel II, and αDel III; see Fig. 1) and characterized them. Protease sensitivity assays and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) studies indicated that the presence of ATP did not significantly change the conformation of the deletion mutants. They were able to prevent protein aggregation but unable to stimulate the refolding of denatured proteins. We have concluded that the helical protrusion is essential for the conformational change to mediate ATP-dependent protein folding rather than for substrate binding. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Reagents—Escherichia coli strains used in this study were DH5α for plasmid preparation and BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The plasmid pK1Eα2 was used as a template for PCR and for the expression of T. KS-1 wild type α chaperonin (αWT) (15Yoshida T. Yohda M. Iida T. Maruyama T. Taguchi H. Yazaki K. Ohta T. Odaka M. Endo I. Kagawa Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273 (Correction (2000) J. Mol. Biol.299, 1399–1400): 635-645Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for GFP, pET21c-GFPUV(His), was a gift from Dr. H. Taguchi. Ex Taq™ DNA polymerase and restriction endonucleases were the products of Takara Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan). ATP, ADP, and thermolysin were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). AMP-PNP and citrate synthase from porcine heart and Thermoplasma acidophilum were obtained from Sigma. The AMP-PNP and ADP were purified by anion exchange chromatography (16Horst M. Oppliger W. Feifel B. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 759-767Google Scholar) or treated with hexokinase (Roche Diagnostics) plus glucose as described (17Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Google Scholar) before use to remove contaminating ATP. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Construction of Helical Protrusion Deletion Mutants and Chaperonin Purification—Helical protrusion deletion mutants of the α subunit, αDel I (Δ256–265), αDel II (Δ251–270), and αDel III (Δ245–276), were each generated by two separate polymerase chain reactions using the pK1Eα2 plasmid as a template. For construction of the αDel I mutant, DNAs encoding the N-terminal moiety (residue 1–255) and the C-terminal moiety (residue 266–548) were amplified using primer pairs containing NdeI/SalI and SalI/BamHI sites, respectively. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen). The inserted DNA fragments were excised with NdeI/SalI and SalI/BamHI and co-ligated into pET23a (Novagen) at the sites of NdeI and BamHI. The linker sequence connecting the N- and C-terminal moieties was Val-Asp (GTC-GAC; SalI recognition sequence). The other two deletion mutants were constructed using the same procedure. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The chaperonins were expressed and purified as described previously (12Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Maruyama T. Odaka M. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44959-44965Google Scholar). Thermal Aggregation Measurement—The thermal aggregation of citrate synthase (CS) from porcine heart was monitored by measuring light scattering at 500 nm with a spectrofluorometer (RF-5300PC, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 50 °C. Native CS (120 nm, as a monomer) was incubated in the assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH8, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence or absence of chaperonins (120 nm). The assay buffer was preincubated at 50 °C and continuously stirred throughout the measurement. Refolding Assay—The GFP used in this paper is a heat-stable mutant with alanine inserted between Met-1 and Ser-2, a His tag in the C-terminal region, and amino acid substitutions of F99S, M153T, V163A, and L165F (7Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Google Scholar, 10Yoshida T. Kawaguchi R. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Yohda M. Maruyama T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 73-85Google Scholar). It was purified as described (19Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1118-1124Google Scholar). The refolding assay was carried out at 60 °C. GFP (5 μm) was denatured in the folding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 mm HCl at room temperature and diluted 100-fold in the folding buffer with or without chaperonins (100 nm). 1 mm ATP was added to the mixture 8 min after the dilution. The fluorescence of GFP at 510 nm with excitation at 396 nm was continuously monitored with a JASCO FP-6500 spectrofluorometer (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The reaction mixtures were continuously stirred at 60 °C throughout the experiments. As a control, native GFP was diluted in the folding buffer without chaperonins. The fluorescence intensity of native GFP was taken as 100%. CS from T. acidophilum was subjected to a refolding assay at 50 °C. CS (19.8 μm, as a monomer) was denatured in 50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.5 containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 5 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 50 °C and then diluted 60-fold in the dilution buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 50 mm MgCl2, and 300 mm KCl) in the absence or presence of chaperonins (0.5 μm). The refolding reactions were conducted for 60 min at 50 °C. 1 mm ATP was added to the mixture 10 min after the dilution. At the indicated time points, aliquots were removed from the mixture, and the recovered enzyme activity was assayed as described by Furutani et al. (20Furutani M. Iida T. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28399-28407Google Scholar). The activity of the native enzyme at the same concentration is taken as 100%. Protease Sensitivity Assay—Chaperonins (50 nm) were incubated with or without nucleotide (1 mm) for 10 min at 65 °C while being continuously mixed. The assay buffer was TNM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 mm MgCl2) or TKM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 25 mm MgCl2). Digestion with thermolysin (1 ng/μl) was carried out for 10 min at 65 °C. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were precipitated using 30% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and then analyzed on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. SAXS Measurement—The SAXS experiments were performed at beamline 15A of the Photon Factory in the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan. The measurements were done at the protein concentrations of 3–7 mg/ml in TNM buffer at 58.5 °C. Samples were incubated with or without adenine nucleotides (αWT, 1 mm; deletion mutants, 3 mm) for 5 min at 58.5 °C before data collection. Scattering patterns were recorded by a CCD-based x-ray detector that consisted of a beryllium-windowed x-ray image intensifier (Be-XRII) (Hamamatsu, V5445P-MOD), an optical lens, a CCD image sensor, and a data acquisition system (Hamamatsu C7300), as described (21Amemiya Y. Ito K. Yagi N. Asano Y. Wakabayashi K. Ueki T. Endo T. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1995; 66: 2290-2294Google Scholar, 22Arai M. Ito K. Inobe T. Nakao M. Maki K. Kamagata K. Kihara H. Amemiya Y. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 121-132Google Scholar). The experimental details and the analyses of the scattering data were essentially the same as described (22Arai M. Ito K. Inobe T. Nakao M. Maki K. Kamagata K. Kihara H. Amemiya Y. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 121-132Google Scholar). Pair distribution (P(r)) functions were calculated by using the GNOM package (23Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Google Scholar). The Q range used for the calculation was from 0.0155 to 0.2 Å-1. The values of the radius of gyration (Rg) and the maximum particle dimension (Dmax) were estimated from the P(r) function. Construction of Helical Protrusion Deletion Mutants—The helical protrusion region of the α subunit of T. KS-1 chaperonin is composed of 32 amino acid residues (residue 245–276) (Fig. 1). To examine its role in the conformational change and molecular chaperone functions, we constructed three helical protrusion deletion mutants (termed αDel I, αDel II, and αDel III), which lack one-third, two-thirds, and the whole of the helical protrusion, respectively (Fig. 1). Each construct was expressed in E. coli and purified in the same manner as the wild type. The deletion of the helical protrusion had no effect on the oligomer formation and ATP hydrolysis (data not shown). Protease Sensitivity Assays of Adenine Nucleotide-induced Conformational Changes of α Chaperonins—Conformational changes of αWT and deletion mutants induced by adenine nucleotides were compared using protease sensitivity assays (12Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Maruyama T. Odaka M. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44959-44965Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The chaperonins were subjected to proteolysis by thermolysin in the absence and presence of adenine nucleotides. To exclude the effects of contaminating ATP in AMP-PNP (a non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP) and ADP, the experiments were conducted using nucleotides purified by treatment with hexokinase plus glucose (17Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Google Scholar). Those treated with hexokinase are referred to as AMP-PNPhex and ADPhex, respectively. αWT was sensitive to digestion by thermolysin in the absence of nucleotide or the presence of ADPhex. In contrast, incubation with ATP rendered αWT resistant to thermolysin. AMP-PNPhex also led to protease resistance in the absence but not the presence of potassium ion (Fig. 2A). This result confirmed that our previous result is not caused by the contamination of ATP in ADP or AMP-PNP. The same experiments were performed using αDel I, αDel II, and αDel III (Fig. 2, B–D). Almost the same pattern was observed in the digestion of αDel I, irrespective of the presence of adenine nucleotides and potassium ion (Fig. 2B). However, neither αDel II nor αDel III was subjected to proteolysis by thermolysin (Fig. 2, C and D). These results are well consistent with our previous observation (12Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Maruyama T. Odaka M. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44959-44965Google Scholar) that the proteases mainly attack the helical protrusion in a nucleotide-free or ADP-bound state. SAXS Analyses of Adenine Nucleotide-induced Conformational Changes of α Chaperonins—To study the conformation change of αWT and deletion mutants further, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were carried out. The measurements were conducted at 58.5 °C under potassium-free conditions where chaperonin-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis was restricted (12Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Maruyama T. Odaka M. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44959-44965Google Scholar). AMP-PNP and ADP purified by anion exchange chromatography (16Horst M. Oppliger W. Feifel B. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 759-767Google Scholar) or treatment with hexokinase plus glucose (17Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Google Scholar) were also used in the measurements. Fig. 3, A–C show the pair distribution (P(r)) functions of αWT (A), αDelI(B), and αDel II (C) in the absence or presence of adenine nucleotides, which were calculated from a Fourier transformation of the intensity functions. Two different peaks were observed in the P(r) curve of αWT (Fig. 3A), suggesting the presence of two different conformations. In contrast, the P(r) function of the nucleotide-free form has a peak at an r value of ∼105 Å (Fig. 3A; black dotted line). The P(r) function was not affected by the addition of ADPhex (Fig. 3A, gray line). The peak shifted to a lower r value of ∼100 Å in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3A, black line). This indicates that the binding of ATP leads to a conformation distinct from the other two forms. The same P(r) curve was obtained in the presence of AMP-PNPhex (Fig. 3A, gray dotted line). The P(r) curves of αDel I in the presence of ATP and AMP-PNPhex differed from those under nucleotide-free conditions and in the presence of ADPhex, but the changes were marginal (Fig. 3B). αDel II exhibited almost no change in its P(r) curve upon the addition of ATP or AMP-PNP (Fig. 3C). The structural parameters obtained in this study and calculated from the crystal structure are summarized in Table I. The values for Rg and the Dmax were computed from the P(r) function using the program GNOM (23Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Google Scholar). In αWT, the conformation in the presence of ATP is the most compact, with an Rg value of 67.6 ± 0.4 Å and a Dmax value of 168 ± 3 Å. The calculated Rg and Dmax are close to values predicted from the crystal structure of Thermoplasma chaperonin (6Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Google Scholar) or the hypothetical asymmetric structure, i.e. one open and one closed ring. The nucleotide-free form and ADP-bound form have a stretched conformation, with Rg of 74.1 ± 0.2 and 72.5 ± 0.6 Å, and a Dmax of 194 ± 2 and 184 ± 4 Å, respectively. Thus, the presence of ATP reduces the value of Rg by ∼6.5 Å and the value of Dmax by ∼26 Å. The conformation in the AMP-PNP-bound state is very similar to that in the ATP-bound state (Table I). The Rg and Dmax values of the conformations without the addition of nucleotides and with ADP are in agreement with those of the open conformation of the Thermoplasma α-thermosome observed by cryo-electron microscopy (25Nitsch M. Walz J. Typke D. Klumpp M. Essen L.O. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 855-857Google Scholar). On the other hand, the addition of ATP and purified AMP-PNP to αDel I and αDel II did not induce a significant conformational change. These results clearly showed that the archaeal chaperonin takes an open conformation in the nucleotide-free or ADP-bound state and changes to the closed conformation on binding to ATP. The result is consistent with previous observations (8Gutsche I. Holzinger J. Rauh N. Baumeister W. May R.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 139-146Google Scholar, 12Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Maruyama T. Odaka M. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44959-44965Google Scholar). In the case of CCT, the closure of the built-in lid was induced not by the binding but by the hydrolysis of ATP (11Meyer A.S. Gillespie J.R. Walther D. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Frydman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 369-381Google Scholar). There seems to be a difference in the mechanism for the closure of the built-in lid between archaeal chaperonins and CCT.Table IStructural parameters of group II chaperoninsProteinNucleotideRgDmaxÅÅαWTaStructural parameter obtained by SAXS, this studyFree74.1 ± 0.2194 ± 2+ ATP67.6 ± 0.4168 ± 3+ AMP-PNPhex68.0 ± 0.3171 ± 2+ ADPhex72.5 ± 0.6184 ± 4αDel IaStructural parameter obtained by SAXS, this studyFree75.6 ± 0.4192 ± 2+ ATP73.6 ± 0.4189 ± 3+ AMP-PNPhex73.8 ± 0.1195 ± 3+ ADPhex75.5 ± 0.2193 ± 2αDel IIaStructural parameter obtained by SAXS, this studyFree73.2 ± 0.1194 ± 4+ ATP71.0 ± 0.3189 ± 5+ AMP-PNPpurbAMP-PNP purified by anion exchange chromatography (16)73.0 ± 0.4188 ± 2+ ADP72.0 ± 0.5186 ± 3CCTcStructural parameter obtained by SAXS with values taken from Meyer et al.

Cell. 2003; 113: 369-381Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab Helical Protrusion Is Not Necessarily Important for Substrate Binding—The effect of deletion mutants on the aggregation of unfolded protein was examined using CS from porcine heart, a homo-dimer of 48 kDa subunits. The time course of CS aggregation was monitored by light scattering. When native CS was diluted in the assay buffer incubated at 50 °C, it aggregated immediately to increase the light scattering (Fig. 4, filled squares). The decrease of light scattering after 10 min of incubation is probably due to the precipitation of the aggregates. At a 1:1 molar ratio of αWT oligomer to CS monomer, the thermal aggregation of CS was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 4, filled circles). All deletion mutants also inhibited the thermal aggregation of CS at an equimolar ratio, despite a slight decrease of efficiency (Fig. 4, filled triangles, open squares, and open circles). Also, the effect of each deletion mutant changes with the concentration (data not shown). These findings show that the helical protrusion region is not indispensable for the recognition and binding of the substrate protein. Helical Protrusion Is Essential for Chaperonin-mediated Protein Refolding—To investigate whether deletion mutants can promote the refolding of denatured proteins, we first used GFP, a monomeric 27-kDa protein, as the substrate protein (Fig. 5A). We employed a heat stable mutant GFP to perform assays at 60 °C (7Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Google Scholar, 10Yoshida T. Kawaguchi R. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Yohda M. Maruyama T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 73-85Google Scholar). When acid-denatured GFP without fluorescence was diluted in the folding buffer at a neutral pH, it refolded spontaneously and the level of fluorescence recovered. Because of the high temperature for GFP refolding, the recovery speed and yield were not high. The yields of spontaneous folding at 15 min after the dilution was estimated to be ∼20% (Fig. 5A, filled squares). In the presence of chaperonins in the folding mixture (at a 2:1 molar ratio of chaperonin to GFP), spontaneous refolding of GFP was inhibited in each case. These results show that deletion mutants are able to capture unfolded GFP in concordance with the above results (Fig. 4). When ATP was added to the mixture 8 min after the dilution of GFP, αWT enhanced the productive refolding of GFP (Fig. 5A, filled circles), whereas deletion mutants failed to initiate GFP folding at a measurable rate (Fig. 5A, filled triangles, open squares, and open circles). Another substrate protein, CS from an acidothermophilic archaeum, T. acidophilum, a homo-dimer of 43 kDa subunits, was tested (Fig. 5B). Only 4% of the activity of CS was recovered without chaperonin (Fig. 5B, filled squares). All of the chaperonin variants used were able to bind denatured CS and inhibit the spontaneous folding of CS. When ATP was added, αWT promoted a 25% reactivation of CS activity (Fig. 5B, filled circles). By contrast, deletion mutants had almost no effect on the proper refolding and enzymatic activity of CS (Fig. 5B, filled triangles, open squares, and open circles). Thus, these findings suggest that the helical protrusion region is indispensable for ATP-dependent protein folding rather than for substrate binding. The helical protrusion is characteristic of all group II chaperonins (13Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Google Scholar). Although it is thought to be important for the function of the group II chaperonins, its role remains unclear. To clarify this issue, we have constructed helical protrusion deletion mutants of T. KS-1 α chaperonin (αDel I, αDel II, and αDel III; see Fig. 1) and characterized them. It has been suggested that the helical protrusion acts as a built-in lid for the central cavity (6Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Google Scholar, 8Gutsche I. Holzinger J. Rauh N. Baumeister W. May R.P. J. Struct.

Protease sensitivity assays and the SAXS experiments revealed that ATP induces a drastic conformational change in αWT under potassium-free conditions (Figs. 2A and 3A). The observed difference between the absence and presence of ATP is ∼26 Å in terms of the value of Dmax (Table I). AMP-PNP induced a similar conformational change in the absence of potassium ion (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table I). Thus, it is concluded that the hydrolysis of ATP is dispensable for this change. ATP and AMP-PNP also induced the conformational change of αDel I, but the extent of the change was much less than that of αWT (Fig. 3B and Table I). In addition, significant structural changes of αDel II were not observed in the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP (Fig. 3C and Table I). These findings clearly demonstrate that the conformational change of αWT induced by ATP binding is a movement of the helical protrusion. From the structural parameters of the model structures (Table I), it could be concluded that the closing of the chaperonin cavity is induced by the binding of ATP. Importantly, we observed that the deletion mutants have no significant ATP-dependent protein-folding activity, even though they are capable of binding unfolded proteins (Fig. 5). Taken together, we conclude that productive protein folding requires a complete closure of the ring cavity. It is likely that even a partial deletion of the region makes it impossible to seal off the central cavity and encapsulate the bound substrate. As was expected, it is thought that the helical protrusion of group II chaperonins plays an equivalent role to GroES in group I chaperonins. The helical protrusion was also assumed to be involved in substrate binding because of the presence of a large hydrophobic patch in the region (6Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Google Scholar, 13Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Google Scholar). In GroEL, the substrate binding sites involve a number of hydrophobic residues that can generally bind hydrophobic regions in unfolded proteins (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Google Scholar). In contrast, the removal of the helical protrusion did not impair the activity for inhibition of the thermal aggregation of CS (Fig. 4). Also, the deletion mutants inhibited the spontaneous refolding of GFP and CS (Fig. 5). These results show that the helical protrusion region is not necessarily important for the recognition and binding of the substrate protein. Similar findings are reported in CCT. A recent study has shown that cleavage of the protrusion does not affect substrate binding ability (11Meyer A.S. Gillespie J.R. Walther D. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Frydman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 369-381Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the CCTγ apical domain suggests that the substrate binding sites are located within the central cavity (26Pappenberger G. Wilsher J.A. Roe S.M. Counsell D.J. Willison K.R. Pearl L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1367-1379Google Scholar). Also, electron microscopic studies of CCT-substrate protein complexes show that actin appears to be bound well below the helical protrusion and that tubulin seems to interact with a much broader region of the apical domains, including parts of the protrusion (9Llorca O. Martin-Benito J. Grantham J. Ritco-Vonsovici M. Willison K.R. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4065-4075Google Scholar, 27Llorca O. Martin-Benito J. Ritco-Vonsovici M. Grantham J. Hynes G.M. Willison K.R. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5971-5979Google Scholar). It is speculated that there is a “true” substrate binding site in the apical domain, although the helical protrusion contributes slightly to the binding to unfolded proteins. Several studies indicated that group II chaperonin subunits have a cluster of relatively conserved residues on the inside face of the apical domain, just below the helical protrusion (24Shomura Y. Yoshida T. Iizuka R. Maruyama T. Yohda M. Miki K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1265-1278Google Scholar, 28Archibald J.M. Blouin C. Doolittle W.F. J. Struct.

Archibald et al. pointed out that this region appears to be in direct contact with actin and tublin in CCT-substrate complexes (28Archibald J.M. Blouin C. Doolittle W.F. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 157-169Google Scholar). It is thought that the region is a new candidate for the substrate binding site. The helical protrusion might have a role in accessing substrate protein in the cavity, as expected from crystallographic studies (6Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Google Scholar, 13Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Google Scholar). We thank M. Arai, K. Maki, K. Kamagata S. Enoki, A. Kadooka, and T.

In Escherichia coli IscS, the active site cysteine Cys328 resides in a flexible loop that potentially influences both the formation and stability of the cysteine persulfide as well as the specificity of sulfur transfer to protein substrates. Alanine-scanning substitution of this 14 amino acid region surrounding Cys328 identified additional residues important for IscS function in vivo. Two mutations, S326A and L333A, resulted in strains that were severely impaired in Fe-S cluster synthesis in vivo. The mutant strains were deficient in Fe-S cluster-dependent tRNA thionucleosides (s2C and ms2i6A) yet showed wild type levels of Fe-S-independent thionucleosides (s4U and mnm5s2U) that require persulfide formation and transfer. In vitro, the mutant proteins were similar to wild type in both cysteine desulfurase activity and sulfur transfer to IscU. These results indicate that residues in the active site loop can selectively affect Fe-S cluster biosynthesis in vivo without detectably affecting persulfide delivery and suggest that additional assays may be necessary to fully represent the functions of IscS in Fe-S cluster formation.

The cysteine desulfurase IscS is the major cellular catalyst for the mobilization and distribution of sulfur from cysteine for a number of different biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 1) (1Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Marquet A. Curr. Opin. Chem.

It is a member of the NifS family of cysteine desulfurases whose first discovered member, NifS, was characterized as a necessary component for activity of the metalloenzyme nitrogenase (5Zheng L.

It was later shown in both Azotobacter vinelandii and Escherichia coli that the homolog iscS is part of a multicistronic operon (isc) required for the biosynthesis of protein Fe-S clusters (6Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). IscS is highly conserved among bacteria and eukarya and is required for viability in organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Kolman C. Soll D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) A. vinelandii (6Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3896-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), elimination of iscS results in a viable organism that displays complex nutritional requirements and severely reduced activity of Fe-S cluster enzymes. Most bacteria harbor multiple nifS homologs. E. coli contains iscS and two other paralogs, csdA and sufS (csdB). These enzymes can be placed into two groups, based on sequence of an active site loop that contains an essential cysteine and other criteria (13Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). By these criteria, E. coli IscS is a group I enzyme, whereas SufS and CSD are members of group II. All use cysteine and selenocysteine as a substrate in vitro with varying efficiency (14Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). IscS is required for selenium mobilization for the synthesis of the modified nucleoside mnm5se2U 1The abbreviations used are: mnm5s2U, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine; s4U, 4-thiouridine; s2C, 2-thiocytidine; ms2i6A, 6-dimethallyl-2-methylthioadenosine; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: mnm5s2U, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine; s4U, 4-thiouridine; s2C, 2-thiocytidine; ms2i6A, 6-dimethallyl-2-methylthioadenosine; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; WT, wild type. in tRNA (15Mihara H. Kato S. Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. Kennedy R.A. Kurihara T. Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. Esaki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6679-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), even though SufS utilizes selenocysteine more efficiently in vitro (14Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the sufS gene is part of the suf operon that is thought to contribute to Fe-S cluster formation under conditions of cellular stress (16Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Deletion of suf genes cause no observable growth defects in E. coli. However, in combination with mutations in iscSUA, all but one suf gene is required for viability (17Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), suggesting that suf and isc genes have overlapping function. The mechanism for cysteine desulfuration by NifS was shown by Dean and co-workers to be a novel utilization of pyridoxal phosphate for transferring the sulfur atom of substrate l-cysteine (or selenocysteine) to a cysteine residue in the active site of the enzyme to give a persulfide or hydrodisulfide (18Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). IscS was isolated based on its ability to provide sulfur for the Fe-S cluster of dihydroxy acid dehydratase and found to have a mechanism similar to NifS (19Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of sulfur incorporation in Fe-S clusters remains unclear, several groups have obtained evidence of complexation and persulfide transfer between IscS and IscU (20Smith A.D.

The amino acid residues in IscS important for interaction with IscU and other potential target proteins (23Tokumoto U. Nomura S. Minami Y. Mihara H. Kato S. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Kanazawa H. Matsubara H. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have not been defined, although a deletion of the C terminus of IscS reduces sulfur transfer and binding to IscU (21Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A primary role for IscS may be to provide sulfur for Fe-S clusters (24Frazzen J. Dean D.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 1, a number of cellular processes that do not involve Fe-S enzymes also require iscS. For instance, IscS is required for the biosynthesis of normal levels of all thionucleosides in E. coli (25Lauhon C.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6820-6829Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and Salmonella typhimurium (26Nilsson K. Lundgren H.K. Hagervall T.G. Bjork G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6830-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although two of them are not expected to involve Fe-S cluster enzymes in their synthesis. The biosynthesis of 4-thiouridine (Fig. 2, s4U) involves the transfer of sulfane sulfur from Cys328 of IscS to a cysteine of the ThiI protein (27Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ThiI, in turn, binds tRNA, activates a specific uridine using Mg-ATP, and transfers the sulfur, during which it is oxidized to a disulfide (30Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33588-33595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The synthesis of 2-thiouridine requires IscS in vitro (31Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and in vivo (15Mihara H. Kato S. Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. Kennedy R.A. Kurihara T. Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6830-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and may be similar to s4U synthesis with the MnmA protein as the recipient of the IscS persulfide (31Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both mnmA and iscS mutants contain mnm5U instead of the thiolated derivative, indicating that the modifications at the 2 and 5 positions are formed independently. The remaining two thionucleosides, dimethallyl-2-methylthioadenosine (ms2i6A) and 2-thiocytidine (s2C) are both considered to require the action of Fe-S proteins for their synthesis. The miaB gene is required for ms2 incorporation into i6A37 in certain tRNAs (32Esberg B. Leung H.C.E. Tsui H.C.T. Bjork G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MiaB has been shown by sequence homology (33Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and in vitro reconstitution (34Pierrel F. Bjork G.R. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to be a 4Fe-4S protein similar in some respects to biotin and lipoate synthases. E. coli mutants lacking either miaB or iscS produce i6A in place of the fully modified base (Fig. 2). Jager et al. (35Leipuviene R. Qian Q. Bjork G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) report that the ttcA gene required for s2C synthesis contains two required Cys-X-X-Cys motifs (35Leipuviene R. Qian Q. Bjork G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that may be indicative of an Fe-S cluster protein. Recently, Leipuviene et al. (36Jager G. Leipuviene R. Pollard M.G. Qian Q. Bjork G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported additional evidence consistent with our results that supports the dual role of IscS in thionucleoside biosynthesis as depicted in Fig. 1. It has been suggested from sequence comparisons and structural data that the active site cysteine in all NifS proteins resides in a loop (37Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the crystal structures of IscS from Thermotoga maritima (37Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and E. coli IscS (38Cupp-Vickery J.R. Urbina H. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), portions of the loop are unstructured. Models of the unresolved region of the loop in E. coli IscS both place Cys328 at least 17 Å from the active site pyridoxal phosphate (38Cupp-Vickery J.R. Urbina H. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and support the suggestion that a flexible loop would allow transfer of the persulfide sulfur at a greater distance to protein substrates (37Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because the role of iscS in E. coli requires distribution of sulfur for a variety of pathways, a major question is how specificity is manifested in sulfur transfer from IscS to each of its protein substrates. This study was initiated to probe the active site loop region of E. coli IscS by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. In this work, we report the characterization of two mutants that are defective in Fe-S biosynthesis in vivo but functional in persulfide formation and transfer in vitro. Strains—The parent strain for the iscS mutant (CL100) used in this study is E. coli MC1061. Preparation and characterization of an inframe iscS deletion in this strain has been described previously (8Olson J.W. Agar J.N. Johnson M.K. Maier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16213-16219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). E. coli strain OD1190, which has a polar disruption of the iscU gene, was a generous gift of Dr. James Imlay. S. enterica strain DM5420 has been described previously (12Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3896-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and has a polar MudJ insertion in iscA. Construction of iscS Alanine Mutants—Alanine mutants were prepared using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) and plasmid pCL010, a pET21c-derived plasmid containing wild type iscS sequence (27Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mutant plasmids were isolated, sequenced, and used to transform strain CL100(DE3) (a DE3 lysogen containing a nonpolar iscS deletion) (9Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This strain exhibited basal expression of T7 RNA polymerase in the absence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and hyper-expression in its presence. Mutations of interest were also prepared in the low copy plasmid pCL199, a derivative of pKO3 (39Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains the iscS gene and adjacent 500-bp flanking regions from the E. coli genome. These mutant plasmids were used to observe low copy effects when expressed in trans as well as to reintegrate the mutant iscS genes back into the chromosome of strain CL100 using previously described techniques (8Olson J.W. Agar J.N. Johnson M.K. Maier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16213-16219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Chromosomal mutations were confirmed by amplification of iscS using IscS.No and IscS.Co primers (9Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) followed by sequence analysis. Analysis of Growth Phenotype—Rich medium was LB and minimal medium was M9-supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, and leucine (40 μg/ml) unless otherwise stated (MC1061 is a leucine auxotroph). The following nutrients were added at the given concentrations when indicated: nicotinic acid (12.5 μg/ml), thiamin (1 μg/ml), isoleucine (40 μg/ml), and valine (40 μg/ml). Ampicillin was used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and chloramphenicol was used at 20 μg/ml. To determine doubling times, cells from overnight cultures in LB were pelleted, washed once with minimal medium, resuspended, and inoculated (1:500) into LB. Cultures were incubated with shaking at 37 °C, and growth was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 600 nm. For assessment of nutritional requirements, cells were grown in nutrient broth, washed, and inoculated into minimal medium containing the relevant supplements prior to monitoring growth. Isolation and Analysis of Unfractionated tRNA—Bulk tRNA was isolated as described previously (9Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) from 100 ml of uninduced cultures in LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). All of the cultures for tRNA analysis were harvested at mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5). Bulk gel-purified tRNA was quantitated by UV absorption at 260 nm, digested (100 μg) to nucleosides using nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase, and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography by the method of Gherke et al. (40Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. McCune R.A. Gerhardt K.O. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 230: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) as described by us (9Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25Lauhon C.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6820-6829Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All of the thionucleosides were analyzed at 260 nm with the exception of 4-thiouridine, which was also analyzed at 330 nm (data not shown). To account for variation in sample loading, the thiouridines and s2C were quantitated by taking the ratio of each peak area to that of pseudouridine in the same chromatogram (41Buck M. Connick M. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The levels of ms2i6A were taken as a relative percentage of the sum of ms2i6A and i6A, which should be independent of the amount of tRNA loaded onto the column. The values were then reported relative to the wild type, which is set to 1.0 (Table I).Table ICharacterization of chromosomal iscS mutantsStrains2Cmnm5s2Us4Ums2i6At2SDHPGDminMC1061 (WT)1.01.01.01.040 ± 51.0 ± 0.10.64 ± 0.03CL100 (ΔiscS)0.05<0.01<0.01<0.01136 ± 60.17 ± 0.040.25 ± 0.01S323A1.01.00.91.046 ± 20.94 ± 0.07NDS326A0.10.90.9<0.01105 ± 110.19 ± 0.080.30 ± 0.01L333A0.21.11.0<0.0164 ± 40.17 ± 0.040.39 ± 0.01S336A1.01.00.91.047 ± 40.81 ± 0.060.50 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Western Analysis of iscS Expression—Antiserum to IscS was prepared from a single rabbit by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). Affinity-purified serum was obtained by passing the serum in 0.5 m NaCl through a column of consisting of 50 mg of IscS immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Antiserum was eluted from the column using 50 mm glycine (pH 3.0) followed by immediate neutralization with 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). For Western analysis, cultures were grown to mid-log phase (A600 0.5) in LB medium, lysed by French Press, and separated into soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206965) Google Scholar) using 12% gels, and immunoblotting was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). A 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-IscS affinity-purified antiserum was followed by a 1:10,000 dilution of an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate. 35S Transfer Assays—Persulfide transfer activity was determined as described previously (21Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Assays were carried out at 23 °C for 30 s and contained 1 μm IscS, 18.5 μm IscU, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 35 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of l-[35S]cysteine (0.19 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) to a final concentration of 57 μm and were terminated by centrifugation at 1000 × g through a size-exclusion column, Bio-Gel P-6 column (Bio-Rad). The spin column eluant was mixed with SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer to give final concentrations of 1% glycerol, 5 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.001% bromphenol blue. Samples were immediately analyzed by gel electrophoresis using a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in the absence of added reducing agent. 35S was visualized by exposure on a phosphorimaging screen and analyzed using a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with Quantity One quantitation software supplied with the instrument. Assembly of Fe-S Clusters on IscU—IscS-mediated assembly of iron-sulfur clusters on IscU was assayed as described previously (21Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 2 μm IscS, 50 μm IscU, 2 mm ferric citrate, and 10 μm pyridoxal phosphate in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Cluster assembly was initiated by the addition of 2.5 mm l-cysteine and 5 mm dithiothreitol and was monitored by circular dichroism on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Cysteine Desulfurase—Cysteine desulfurase activity of IscS proteins was performed by monitoring sulfide release from l-cysteine as described previously (19Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol.

Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Specific activity of the purified proteins was determined at a cysteine concentration of 2.5 mm. Protein concentration was 100 nm. Succinate Dehydrogenase—In replicates of six, cultures (5 ml) were grown in LB medium to mid-log phase (A650 = 0.6). Cell pellets from 3 ml of culture were frozen at –20 °C and assayed within 1 week. Pellets were resuspended and washed in 300 μl of 20 mm Tris citrate buffer (pH 8) and assayed as described previously (12Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3896-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydratase—Cultures were grown in minimal A salts supplemented with 0.2% sodium gluconate and 0.2% casamino acids as well as with leucine, isoleucine, nicotinate, and thiamin at the levels described above. Cells were harvested at A600 = 0.8 by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min. After storage at –80 °C, cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), incubated with lysozyme for 20 min on ice, sonicated (3 × 20-s bursts), and then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and immediately frozen on dry ice and stored until assayed (<24 h). Dehydratase was assayed in two steps for the formation of pyruvate according to the procedure described by Gardner and Fridovich (44Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1468-1473Google Scholar). Activity is expressed in units/milligram protein where 1 unit = 1 μmol/min pyruvate formed. s4U Assays—DEAE filter disc assays were performed as previously described for the formation of s2U (30Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33588-33595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and s4U (27Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For s4U, the assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 20 μm unmodified tRNAPhe, 20 μm l-[35S]cysteine, 300 nm ThiI, and 1 μm His6-tagged mutant or WT IscS. Reaction time was 8 min at 37 °C. Assays for s2U formation were performed similarly using unmodified tRNAGlu as substrate (30Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33588-33595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Generation of IscS Mutants—Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed on a 14 amino acid region (Ser323-Ser336) that encompasses the active site loop region of E. coli IscS. Fourteen plasmids containing the relevant alanine substitutions in IscS were generated (see “Materials and Methods”). The plasmids were confirmed by sequencing and transformed into CL100(DE3) where the plasmid-encoded gene provided the only source of IscS in the cell. Alignment of this region from a selection of group I IscS homologs from taxonomically diverse organisms is shown in Fig. 3. Thionucleoside Profile of iscS Mutants—As an initial screen for mutant IscS function, thionucleoside levels in each of the 14 plasmid-containing strains were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of tRNA enzymatic digests. The strain containing the C328A mutant had a thionucleoside profile identical to the iscSΔ strain, consistent with previous reports that Cys328 is a critical residue in IscS. Two of the 13 remaining mutations (S326A and L333A) resulted in altered thionucleoside levels. These alleles and two additional mutations as controls (S323A and S336A) were integrated into the chromosome for further analysis. The levels of each of the four tRNA thionucleosides isolated from the four resulting mutants are shown in Table I. The two control mutants (S323A and S336A) had thionucleoside levels indistinguishable from those of a wild-type (MC1061) strain. In contrast, the S326A and L333A mutants had significantly decreased levels of s2C and ms2i6A while maintaining wild-type levels of the thiouridines mnm5s2U and s4U. The spectrum of thionucleosides of the S326A chromosomal mutant is shown in Fig. 4. A similar spectrum was observed with the L333A mutant. The mutant spectra are different than either the parental or ΔiscS strains being instead similar to that produced by a block in miaB (Fig. 1) (32Esberg B. Leung H.C.E. Tsui H.C.T. Bjork G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the MiaB-catalyzed step being defective in the iscS mutants. MiaB is a member of the SAM radical superfamily of proteins that contain an oxygen labile Fe-S cluster (33Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Thus, for this thionucleoside in particular, the data support the conclusion that an Fe-S cluster protein is defective. Growth Is Compromised in iscS Mutants—E. coli strains lacking iscS have well documented growth defects, including slow growth in rich medium. Growth properties of the four iscS mutants were explored. The doubling time of these mutant strains in rich medium are listed in Table I. The two mutants, L333A and S336A, that were defective in thionucleoside production had a longer doubling time than the other two point mutants or the wild-type strain. However, in both cases, the doubling time was significantly shorter than that of an ΔiscS mutant. In M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose and leucine (to satisfy parental auxotrophy), strain CL100 (ΔiscS) required nicotinic acid, thiamine, and isoleucine for growth (9Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, the S326A and L333A mutants grew in the absence of nicotinic acid, thiamine, or isoleucine after a significant lag. The lag time could be shortened by isoleucine or thiamine. The control S323A and S336A mutants exhibited growth behavior similar to the parent strain. In summary, the S326A and L333A mutants d"

Replacement of tyrosine 9 with the structurally conservative phenylalanine (AhRY9F) abolished binding to dioxin response element (DRE) D, E, and A and abrogated DRE-driven gene induction mediated by the AhR with no effect on TCDD binding, TCDD-induced nuclear localization, or ARNT heterodimerization. The speculated role for phosphorylation at tyrosine 9 was also examined. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting could not detect a major difference between the AhRY9F mutant and wild-type AhR, but a basic isoelectric point shift was detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of AhRY9F. However, an antibody raised to recognize only phosphorylated tyrosine 9 (anti-AhRpY9) confirmed that AhR tyrosine 9 is not a phosphorylated residue required for DRE binding. Kinase assays using synthetic peptides corresponding to the wild-type and mutant AhR residues 1–23 demonstrated that a tyrosine at position 9 is important for substrate recognition at serine(s)/threonine(s) within this sequence by purified protein kinase C (PKC). Also, compared with AhRY9F, immunopurified full-length wild-type receptor was more rapidly phosphorylated by PKC. Furthermore, co-treatment of AhR-deficient cells that expressed AhRY9F and a DRE-driven luciferase construct with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and TCDD resulted in a 30% increase in luciferase activity compared with AhRY9F treated with TCDD alone. Overall, AhR tyrosine 9, which is not a phosphorylated residue itself but is required for DNA binding, appears to play a crucial role in AhR activity by permitting proper phosphorylation of the AhR.

This protein is believed to mediate the biological and toxic effects of a class of environmental pollutants, best exemplified by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin) (5Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2326) Google Scholar). TCDD binding initiates the process of transformation, which includes dissociation of one or several of the chaperone-related proteins from the unliganded AhR in the cytoplasm, translocation of the receptor-ligand complex into the nucleus, and dimerization with ARNT, to form the active TCDD-AhR-ARNT transcription factor complex (6Rowlands J.C. Gustafsson J.A. Crit Rev. Toxicol. 1997; 27: 109-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 7Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). The endogenous ligand for the AhR remains unknown. The active AhR-ARNT complex specifically recognizes a consensus sequence, termed a dioxin response element (DRE, 5′-CACGCNA-3′), located in the upstream regulatory region of AhR-responsive genes, such as Cyp1A1, leading to transcription initiation. The basic region of the AhR contains multiple essential structural components for direct contact to DNA. It has two basic clusters separated by about 20 amino acids, both of which appear to be engaged in direct protein-DNA contact. Mutation of certain positively charged residues in either cluster (e.g. arginine 14 in the more N-terminal basic region or arginine 39 in the nominal basic region) to alanine or lysine has been found to abolish the formation of the ternary complex between the AhR-ARNT dimer and the DRE, suggesting that it is these basic residues that directly contact the DRE (8Dong L. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7942-7948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Bacsi S.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol.

Previous investigations had determined that when N-terminal deletion analyses were performed to map the DNA binding domain of an AhR mutant lacking the C-terminal half and the minimal ligand binding domain (AhRCΔ516), the first 9 amino acids, including tyrosine 9, were dispensable for constitutive DNA binding activity (11Swanson H.I. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31657-31665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, N-terminal deletion analyses of the full-length mouse AhR indicated that the first 9 amino acids are required for TCDD-induced DNA binding of the AhR but not required for heterodimerization with ARNT (10Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3743-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Also, amino acid scanning mutations to alanine, serine, or tryptophan showed that tyrosine 9 is solely responsible for the loss of DNA binding and transcriptional activity of these N-terminal deletion mutants (9Bacsi S.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8843-8850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3743-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Besides arginines 14 and 39, AhR tyrosine 9 was the only residue in the N terminus whose mutation resulted in dramatic loss of both DNA binding and transcriptional activity (9Bacsi S.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8843-8850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3743-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These data clearly demonstrate that AhR tyrosine 9 is a critical residue required for full-length AhR activity. However, the mechanism by which AhR tyrosine 9 plays a role in AhR activity remains controversial. While this residue is not expected to directly contact DNA, several mechanisms including phosphorylation of this residue have been speculated (9Bacsi S.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8843-8850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Park S. Henry E.C. Gasiewicz T.A. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 2003; 412: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we examine three known or speculated aspects of AhR activation in which tyrosine 9 may potentially play a role. We analyze the impact of a tyrosine 9 mutation on various known steps of the AhR mechanism of action, including ligand binding, nuclear localization, and ARNT heterodimerization, as well as the ability to bind to various DRE sequences. We also test the hypothesis that tyrosine 9 is required for ligand-dependent DNA binding (i.e. for full-length AhR) (11Swanson H.I. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31657-31665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Kikuchi Y. Ohsawa S. Mimura J. Ema M. Takasaki C. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the hypothesis that tyrosine 9 is required for N-terminal cleavage of the AhR prior to DNA binding (15Bradfield C.A. Glover E. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 13-19PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we address the hypothesis that phosphorylation of, or mediated by, tyrosine 9 is critical for normal AhR activation (10Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3743-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Minsavage G.D. Vorojeikina D.P. Gasiewicz T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). While AhR tyrosine 9 does not appear to be essential for ligand-elicited nuclear localization or ARNT dimerization, it is necessary for DNA binding of the full-length protein. Although phosphorylation of the AhR tyrosine 9 is not required for DNA binding, mutating tyrosine 9 alters the isoelectric points of the AhR charged forms suggesting that tyrosine 9 plays a role in post-translational modification of other AhR residue(s). We demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates the wild-type (WT) AhR, and that mutating AhR tyrosine 9 decreases PKC-elicited phosphorylation of the AhR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decreased transcriptional activity of the AhRY9F mutant can be partially overcome upon co-treatment with TCDD and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). These data demonstrate for the first time that, while tyrosine 9 itself is not phosphorylated, it can play a crucial role in phosphorylation of the AhR and AhR-mediated gene transcription. Generation of AhR Constructs—Site-directed mutagenesis and construction of pcDNA3/βAHR-HIS and pcDNA3/βAHRY9F-HIS were performed as described previously (9Bacsi S.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8843-8850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol.

For generation of the pHM6/AhRs that code for N-terminally HA-tagged and C-terminally 6× histidine-tagged AhRs, the wild-type and mutant AhR coding sequences were amplified from pcDNA3/βAHR or pcDNA3/βAHR mutant DNA by Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase using the forward primer, 5′-CGA CCC AAG CTT GCT AGC AAT GTC TAG CGG CGC CAA C-3′ and the reverse primer, 5′-GGT TAC CCG CGG CTC GAG GGA TCC CAC TCT GCA CCT TGC TTA G-3′. HindIII and KspI were used to digest the PCR product and pHM6 to allow subcloning of the amplified AhR coding sequences into pHM6 (Roche Applied Science). For generation of the AhR346 truncation mutants, the wild-type and mutant AhR coding sequence was amplified from pcDNA3/βAHR and pcDNA3/βAHRY9F by Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase using T7 forward primer and the reverse primer, 5′-CCG CTC GAG CGG TCA GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG CCG GAA AAC TGT CAT GCC-3′, containing coding sequences for 6 consecutive histidines, a stop codon, and a XhoI site. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and XhoI and subcloned into the similarly restricted pcDNA3/Neo to generate pcDNA3/βAHR346-HIS and pcDNA3/βAHR346Y9F-HIS. Cell Culture—Wild-type (Hepa1c1c7) and AhR-deficient mouse hepatoma cells (BPrc1TAO) were kind gifts from Dr. J. Whitlock, Jr. (Stanford University). These cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator and grown in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Subcellular Localization of AhR-GFP Fusion Proteins—The GFP coding sequence was amplified from pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase using the forward primer, 5′-ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CTA AAA TGG TGA GCA AGG GC-3′ containing the NotI site and the reverse primer, 5′-GGT ATG GCT GAT TAT GAT CAG-3′. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and NotI and subcloned into the similarly restricted pcDNA3/βAHRs to generate pcDNA3/βAHR495-GFP. These vectors were transiently transfected into Hepa1c1c7 cells on coverslips. After treatment with either Me2SO- or TCDD-containing medium for an hour, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, mounted on slides, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. In Vitro Translation of Wild-type and Mutant AhRs and ARNT, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA), and Supershift EMSA— EMSAs were performed essentially as described previously (13Minsavage G.D. Vorojeikina D.P. Gasiewicz T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Henry E.C. Kent T.A. Gasiewicz T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of in vitro translated AhRs and ARNT were incubated with either 0.1% Me2SO or 10 nm TCDD (Cambridge Isotopes, Cambridge, MA) for 90 min at room temperature and then mixed with 50,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DRE at 0.085 m NaCl and 10 mm DTT and analyzed in a 4% nondenaturing gel. The DNA binding form of the AhR-ARNT complex was visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For DRE synthesis, one strand of each DRE (17Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6575-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase prior to annealing with the unlabelled complementary strand; DRE D (AhRE3), 5′-GAT CCG GCT CTT CT CACGCAACTC CGA GCT CA-3′; DRE E (AhRE2), 5′-CCC AGT GCT GT CACGCTAGCT GGG GGA GGG GAA-3′; DRE A (AhRE5), 5′-TGC GCT TCT CACGCGAGCT TGG-3′. The duplex oligonucleotide contains a single AhR binding sequence (underlined). Supershift assays were performed as described for EMSAs with the exception of the use of the HA-tagged AhR expression vectors and the inclusion of antibody at the incubation step just prior to DRE addition. The antibodies that recognize the hemagglutinin epitope (HA.11, Covance, Berkeley, CA), the AhR (Rpt-9), a nonspecific rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories), or the anti-AhR phosphotyrosine 9 antibody were used for supershift assays. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Study—Interaction of AhR with ARNT was investigated by using radiolabeled ARNT expressed in the TnT® (Promega) system as described above with the exception of the inclusion of 15 μCi of [35S]methionine in the reaction mixture. 35S-labeled ARNT was incubated with the similarly expressed but unlabeled histidine-tagged AhRs in the presence or absence of 10 nm TCDD (in 0.1% Me2SO) for 90 min at room temperature. AhR-bound ARNT was precipitated with 70 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C in the His tag lysis buffer with 0.3 m NaCl. The pellet was washed twice with His tag lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole and boiled with SDS-PAGE buffer. The co-precipitated ARNT was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Co-transfection Assay of AhR-deficient Cells—To determine AhRWT and AhRY9F transactivation activity, 2 × 105 AhR-deficient cells (BPrc1TAO or COS-7) were co-transfected with 0.45 μg of AhR expression vectors (pcDNA3/βAHRs), 0.45 μg of DRE-reporter gene (p2DLuc), and 0.1 μg of normalization vector (pRSVLacZ) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or GenePORTER (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) in 6-well plates as described previously (12Park S. Henry E.C. Gasiewicz T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After the recovery from transfection, the cells were treated with either 0.1% Me2SO or 4 nm TCDD (in 0.1% Me2SO) for 22 h and harvested for the reporter gene assay. DRE-driven luciferase activity was measured with the luciferase assay kit (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was determined with Galacto-Light Plus (Tropix, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer using a Turner Model TD-20e Luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoblot Analysis of Partially Purified Full-length AhRs with Anti-phosphotyrosine Antibody—The pcDNA3/βAHR-HIS and pcDNA3/βAHRY9F-HIS vectors were transiently transfected into the AhR-deficient TAO cells using GenePORTER according to the manufacturer and partially purified exactly as previously described using Ni-NTA-agarose (12Park S. Henry E.C. Gasiewicz T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the membrane was probed with PY-20 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Transduction Laboratory, Lexington, KY) in 3% BSA-TBST. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-AhR antibody (Rpt.1; ascites prepared using hybridoma cells that were a kind gift from Dr. G. Perdew (Pennsylvania State University)). The primary antibody was located with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and visualized with LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis of Wild-type AhR and AhRY9F— Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed utilizing radiolabeled AhRs separately expressed in the TnT® system as described above with the exception of inclusion of 15 μCi of [35S]methionine in the reaction mixture, methods similar to those previously described (13Minsavage G.D. Vorojeikina D.P. Gasiewicz T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 50 μl of the TnT® lysate containing 35S-labeled AhR was diluted with 150 μl of HEDG buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol; adjusted to pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitors. 50 μl of this mixture was added to 30 μl of HEDG containing 1.5 μg/μl carrier protein and added to 215 μl of rehydration buffer (6.4 m urea, 2.6 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 39 mm DTT, 0.2% Bio-Lytes 3/10 ampholytes, 0.001% bromphenol blue). The Bio-Rad Protean IEF Cell and reagents were used for isoelectric focusing (IEF) and the Criterion Precast Gel System was used for SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). ReadyStrip IPG 11-cm strips (pH range 3–10) were actively rehydrated (application of 50 V) at 16 °C covered with mineral oil for 26 h. For IEF, a slow ramping protocol was followed: a conditioning step of 250 V for 15 min, followed by voltage ramping up to 8000 V over 2.5 h, and final focusing at 8000 V for 80,000 VH. Maximum current limit was set at 50 μA per gel, with total VH not exceeding 100,000 VH. Following IEF, the IPG strips were equilibrated for 30 min in DTT equilibration buffer (5 m urea, 0.8 m thiourea, 4% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 20% glycerol, and 130 mm DTT), followed by 30 min in iodoacetamide equilibration buffer (5 m urea, 0.8 m thiourea, 4% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 20% glycerol, and 135 mm iodoacetamide). IPG strips were loaded to the well of a 7.5% Tris-HCl precast gel and run at a constant voltage of 200 V for 1 h. Proteins from the 2nd dimension gels were transferred to Sequi-Blot PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) and 35S-labeled AhRs were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-AhR Phosphotyrosine 9 Production and Immunodetection of Phosphorylated AhR Tyrosine 9 —Synthesis of peptides, BSA conjugation, and generation of the phosphopeptide antibody was carried out by Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX) as previously described (18Bernard A. Kazlauskas A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Keshvara L. Benhayon D. Magdaleno S. Curran T. J. Biol.

A BLAST search was performed to optimize selection of sequence that would be most likely antigenic and exhibit minimal cross-reactivity with nonspecific proteins. The hydrophilic region, residues 4–16 (GANIT(pY)ASRKRRK) with a cysteine on the C terminus for keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugation, was used as the phosphotyrosine 9 peptide antigen purified to >90% for presentation to rabbits. For affinity purification, a non-phosphopeptide control of the same sequence without a phosphorylated tyrosine 9 was used as an additional affinity support to remove nonspecific antibodies prior to use of the phosphotyrosine 9 peptide affinity column for capture of the antibodies of interest. Both the control and phosphopeptide were used to test antibody cross-reactivity with non-phosphorylated peptides by ELISA. BSA was conjugated to the phosphopeptide (BSA-pY9) using the glutaraldehyde conjugation method to allow optimization for immunodetection of phosphorylated tyrosine 9. To determine the specificity of the anti-AhRpY9 antibody, the BSA-pY9 conjugate was incubated with a mixture of alkaline phosphatase and potato acid phosphatase to remove the phosphate group from tyrosine 9 to serve as a negative control. For detection of AhR from transfected cells, AhR-deficient cells were transfected with 8 μg of an AhR expression vector (pHM6/AHR) using GenePORTER in 100-mm plates 24 h after plating 2 × 106 cells in each plate. AhR-deficient cells from confluent plates were not transfected as a negative control. After 48 h of recovery, cells were treated for 1 h with either 0.1% Me2SO or 10 nm TCDD. Cells were washed with Hank's Buffer, and total protein was collected by triturating the cells in 150 μl of high salt HEG buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm Na2EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.45 m NaCl, adjusted to pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini Tablets, Roche Applied Science). The AhR was immunoprecipitated from the lysate preparation with an anti-HA antibody. The pelleted protein was loaded on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. The primary antibodies were located with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and visualized with LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate. To determine if the anti-AhRpY9 antibody was capable of immunoprecipitating the AhR, wild-type and AhRY9F HA-tagged receptors were translated in a total volume of 50 μl containing TnT®-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase for 90 min at 30 °C as described above with the exception of inclusion of 15 μCi of [35S]methionine in the reaction mixture. Equal amounts of in vitro translated AhRs and non-labeled ARNT were incubated with either 0.1% Me2SO or 10 nm TCDD (Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA) for 90 min at room temperature. Aliquots of the mixture were immunoprecipitated using either excess anti-HA antibody or excess anti-AhRpY9 antibodies. Pelleted protein was solubilized in SDS-loading buffer and separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE. [35S]AhRs were visualized with a PhosphorImager. PKC Activity Assays—For the peptide substrate PKC assays, peptides corresponding to the N terminus of the mouse AhR (residues 1–23) were synthesized by Alpha Diagnostic International. These peptides included the wild-type (AhR-(1–23)WT) sequence (MSSGANITYASRKRRKPVQKTVK), the Y9F (AhR-(1–23)Y9F) mutant sequence (MSSGANITFASRKRRKPVQKTVK), and a sequence containing a phosphorylated tyrosine 9 (AhR-(1–23)pY9) (MSSGANIT(pY)ASRKRRKPVQKTVK). A control peptide was synthesized corresponding to mouse AhR residues 383–406 (EEGREHLQKRSTSLPFMFATGEAVK). The specific PKC substrate peptide control (QKRPSQRSKYL) was purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY). All AhR peptides were conjugated with biotin on the C terminus and >96% pure as determined by mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography. The aqueous peptides were monitored by amino acid analysis at the University of Rochester Proteomics Core Sequencing Facility to ensure that the appropriate amounts of peptides were used for each experiment. The PKC assays (using an active mixture of PKC α, β, and γ) with the required reagents purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions were carried out as described by the manufacturer. For the PKC-elicited phosphorylation of full-length AhR, AhRs were expressed in the TnT system as described above, immunoprecipitated using either Rpt-9 or the anti-HA antibody and protein A/G-agarose plus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The pelleted immunocomplexes were washed extensively with IP wash buffer (40 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and then either incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with alkaline phosphatase or buffer and washed extensively in IP wash buffer. The washed immunocomplexes were then incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C with an active mixture of PKC and [32P]ATP, as described by the manufacturer. Pelleted protein was solubilized in SDS-loading buffer at the time point indicated and loaded to a 7.5% denaturing gel for SDS-PAGE. Protein was then transferred to PVDF membrane and detected using a PhosphorImager. The amount of AhR was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using anti-AhR antibodies or anti-HA antibodies as indicated. The primary antibodies were located with HRP-conjugated IgG and visualized with LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate. PMA Effect on Transcriptional Activity—AhR-deficient cells (2.0 × 104) were seeded into each well of 24-well plates and incubated at 37 °C. 60–80 percent confluent cells were washed with serum-free medium and transfected with 250 μl of serum-free medium containing 400 ng of the designated pHM6/HA-AhR-HIS construct, 100 ng of the DRE-driven firefly luciferase reporter construct, p2DLuc, and 15 ng of Renilla luciferase vector pRL-TK (Promega) that was preincubated with 2.6 μl of GenePORTER transfection reagents at room temperature for 45 min. Four hours later, another 250 μl of growth media containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added into each well to achieve the final serum concentration of 10%. Fresh medium was added 24 h later. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the triplicate wells were treated with either vehicle (0.15% Me2SO), 10 nm TCDD, 100 nm PMA, a combination of 10 nm TCDD and 100 nm PMA, or a combination of 10 nm TCDD, 100 nm PMA, 1 μm GF 109203X, and 1 μm RO 31–8220. PMA, GF 109203X, and RO 31–8220 were purchased from BioMol. In a separate experiment, similarly transfected cells were pretreated for 15 min with 4 μm chelerythrine chloride (not shown) (Sigma) before the treatment performed above, as described previously (30Long W.P.

https://openalex.org/W2068052691,"The present studies show for the first time that demineralized bone re-calcifies rapidly when incubated at 37 °C in rat serum: re-calcification can be demonstrated by Alizarin Red and von Kossa stains, by depletion of serum calcium, and by uptake of calcium and phosphate by bone matrix. Re-calcification is specific for the type I collagen matrix structures that were calcified in the original bone, with no evidence for calcification in periosteum or cartilage. Re-calcification ceases when the amount of calcium and phosphate introduced into the matrix is comparable to that present in the original bone prior to demineralization, and the re-calcified bone is palpably hard. Re-calcified bone mineral is comparable to the original bone mineral in calcium to phosphate ratio and in Fourier transform infrared and x-ray diffraction spectra. The serum activity responsible for re-calcification is sufficiently potent that the addition of only 1.5% serum to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium causes bone re-calcification. This putative serum calcification factor has an apparent molecular mass of 55-150 kDa and is inactivated by trypsin or chymotrypsin. The serum calcification factor must act on bone for 12 h before re-calcification can be detected by Alizarin Red or von Kossa staining and before the subsequent growth of calcification will occur in the absence of serum. The speed, matrix-type specificity, and extent of the serum-induced re-calcification of demineralized bone suggest that the serum calcification factor identified in these studies may participate in the normal calcification of bone.

The speed, matrix-type specificity, and extent of the serum-induced re-calcification of demineralized bone suggest that the serum calcification factor identified in these studies may participate in the normal calcification of bone. This study is a continuation of our investigations into the mechanisms that initiate the normal calcification of bone and the abnormal calcification of arteries and into the mechanisms that inhibit these calcifications. We recently proposed the hypothesis that artery calcification is linked to bone resorption (1Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 317-327Google Scholar, 2Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 817-824Google Scholar) to explain the association between increased bone resorption and increased artery calcification that has been seen in the vitamin D-treated rat (1Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 317-327Google Scholar), in the osteoprotegerin-deficient mouse (3Bucay N. Sarosi I. Dunstan C.R. Morony S. Tarpley J. Capparelli C. Scully S. Tan H.L. Xu W. Lacey D.L. Boyle W. Simonset W.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1260-1268Google Scholar), and in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (see Ref. 2Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 817-824Google Scholar for references). One prediction of the hypothesis that artery calcification is linked to bone resorption is that inhibitors of bone resorption should inhibit artery calcification (2Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 817-824Google Scholar). In previous studies we tested this prediction using three different types of bone resorption inhibitors, each with an entirely different mode of action on the osteoclast, the amino bisphosphonates alendronate and ibandronate (2Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 817-824Google Scholar), the cytokine osteoprotegerin (4Price P.A. June H.H. Buckley J.R. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1610-1616Google Scholar), and the V-H+-ATPase inhibitor SB 242784 (5Price P.A. June H.H. Buckley J.R. Williamson M.K. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 547-552Google Scholar). Each bone resorption inhibitor potently inhibited artery calcification. Ibandronate, osteoprotegerin, and SB 242784 are each highly specific inhibitors of the osteoclast at the concentrations used in these studies and have no known actions on vascular cells. Their ability to potently inhibit vascular calcification is therefore hard to reconcile with the hypothesis that the process is initiated by the action of vascular cells in the artery wall. We have therefore advanced an alternative hypothesis to explain the relation between bone resorption and artery calcification, the hypothesis that a causative agent for artery calcification arises in bone metabolism, travels in blood, and then induces calcification in the artery wall. If the link between bone resorption and artery calcification is blood, then it follows that blood should contain the causative agent for artery calcification. However, because this putative-calcifying agent apparently arises in bone-metabolic processes, it seems likely that its normal physiological function is to participate in the calcification of bone, not arteries, and that artery calcification itself occurs only when there is a breakdown in the normal mechanisms that inhibit calcification in the artery wall, such as matrix Gla protein (6Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Google Scholar, 7Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1400-1407Google Scholar). The present experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that blood contains an agent that participates in the calcification of bone. The results of these experiments demonstrate that serum indeed contains a potent agent (or agents 1The use of the singular terms “factor” and “agent” is not meant to imply that there exists only one molecule that is involved in the serum-initiated re-calcification of bone. 1The use of the singular terms “factor” and “agent” is not meant to imply that there exists only one molecule that is involved in the serum-initiated re-calcification of bone.) that initiates the re-calcification of demineralized bone, and additional experiments were accordingly undertaken to characterize this serum agent. Materials—42-day-old, 22-day-old (weanling), and newborn albino rats (Sprague-Dawley derived) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MD). One calcification medium, termed DMEM, 2The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared. was prepared by supplementing each 500-ml volume of DMEM (Invitrogen) with 5 ml of penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1 ml of 10% sodium azide, and 1.1 ml of 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (final medium Pi concentration = 2 mm). The other calcification medium was a physiological buffer that contained 30 mm NaHCO3, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.02% azide. Sodium heparin and Alizarin Red S were purchased from Sigma. Rats were killed by exsanguination while under isoflurane anesthetic (40- and 22-day-old rats) or by decapitation (newborn rats). For serum preparation, blood was allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 10 min in a clinical centrifuge. For plasma, blood was drawn into a heparin-containing syringe to achieve a final heparin concentration of 75 μg/ml, and plasma was collected by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 10 min. Serum was stored in 1-ml aliquots at -70 °C until use, whereas plasma was used immediately after collection. Tibias and calvaria were dissected from newborn rats, demineralized in 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5, for 72 h at room temperature using a 300-fold molar excess of EDTA to mineral calcium, washed exhaustively with ultra pure water to remove all traces of EDTA, and stored at -20 °C until use. Tendons were obtained from the tails of 40-day-old rats and extracted with EDTA as described above and dried. Dry tendon segments weighing ∼3 mg were re-hydrated by overnight equilibration in ultra pure water before use. The University of California, San Diego, Animal Subjects Committee approved all animal experiments. Re-calcification Procedures—Experiments to examine matrix calcification in rat serum were carried out with 35-mm culture dishes (Falcon 3001) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2 using 2 ml of rat serum, heparin plasma, or physiological buffer, each containing 0.02% sodium azide to prevent bacterial growth. After equilibration with 7.5% CO2 at 37 °C, serum maintained a stable pH value of 7.4 throughout the duration of the 6-day incubation, and the physiological buffer maintained a pH of 7.35. A single wet tibia or calvarium, or a rehydrated tendon (3 mg of dry weight) was added to 2 ml of rat serum, rat plasma, or physiological buffer and placed in the incubator for 6 days. To assess the progress of matrix calcification, 50-μl aliquots were removed at the start of the incubation and at each 24 h thereafter and stored frozen until analysis to determine media calcium levels. The effect of adding different amounts of rat serum on the calcification of tibia and tendon was examined using 10 ml of DMEM in 100-mm culture dishes (Falcon 3803) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. A single demineralized tibia or a 3-mg tendon sample (dry weight) was added to each 100-mm plate. The effect of preincubation in serum on the subsequent calcification of demineralized tibias in DMEM was examined by first preincubating each tibia in 2 ml of rat serum at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2, then rinsing the tibia for 15 min each in two 10-ml aliquots of DMEM, and finally incubating the washed tibia in 10 ml of DMEM for 5 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Finally, early stages in the serum-induced calcification of demineralized tibia were examined by incubating each tibia in 2 ml of rat serum for the desired time; tibias were then added directly to Alizarin Red stain or fixed in absolute ethanol, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with von Kossa. Biochemical Analyses—The procedures used for Alizarin Red and von Kossa staining have been described (8Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Google Scholar). For quantitative assessment of calcification, matrices were extracted for 24 h at room temperature with 1 ml of 0.15 m HCl. Calcium levels in serum and in the acid extract of matrices were determined colorimetrically using cresolphthalein complexone (Sigma), and phosphate levels were determined as described (8Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Google Scholar). To characterize the molecular mass of the serum calcification factor, 1 ml of serum from a 40-day-old rat was fractionated over a 25-ml column of Sephacryl S-100HR equilibrated at room temperature with DMEM using a buffer reservoir that was continuously flushed with 5%CO2 to maintain a pH of 7.4. The absorbance at 280 nm was determined for each 1-ml fraction, small aliquots of each fraction were set aside for electrophoresis, and each fraction was then placed into separate wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate. A single demineralized newborn rat tibia was then added to each well and incubated for 6 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To determine the apparent molecular weight of serum proteins that co-eluted with the serum calcification activity in this experiment, 2-μl aliquots of rat serum and of fractions 9, 11, and 14 (Fig. 5) were electrophoresed on a 4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To determine whether the serum factor that initiates bone re-calcification is inactivated by proteases, four 10-ml samples of DMEM were prepared that contained: no serum, 5% rat serum, 5% serum and 1 mg of trypsin, and 5% serum and 1 mg of chymotrypsin. Each solution was preincubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. A single demineralized newborn rat tibia was then added, and the solutions were incubated for 6 days at 37 °C. To assess the effect of preincubation with proteases on the integrity of serum proteins, aliquots of each medium were removed after the 24-h preincubation step, electrophoresed on a 4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (load: no protease, 10 μl medium; protease, 50 μl). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to analyze the mineral from tibias that were re-calcified by incubation in rat serum or in DMEM containing 5% rat serum and from newborn rat tibia. Ten demineralized tibias were each re-calcified in 2 ml of rat serum for 6 days at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2. Ten demineralized tibias were also each re-calcified by incubation in 10 ml of DMEM containing 5% rat serum for 6 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The diaphyseal regions were then obtained by dissection from each re-calcified tibia and from 10 non-demineralized newborn tibias. The resulting 30 diaphyseal regions were dried, pooled according to the three treatment groups, and ground with an agate mortar. The samples were analyzed as KBr pellets (3% w/w), and 256 scans were acquired at 4-cm-1 resolution using a Nicolet Magna IR 550 FTIR spectrometer. The Re-calcification of Weanling Rat Tibias—Tibias were dissected from thirty 22-day-old rats and cut to remove the bone ends, and the midshaft 1 cm of cortical bone was freed of marrow and cancellous bone. Ten tibias were saved for later analyses, and 20 were demineralized for 72 h with 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5. Ten demineralized tibias were each separately incubated for 3 days at 37 °C in 2 ml of rat serum, washed twice for 15 min each with 20 ml of 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm calcium, 3 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaHCO3, and 150 μg/ml fetuin (Sigma), and then incubated in 20 ml of this buffer in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Ten demineralized tibias were placed directly into 20 ml of this buffer without serum pre-treatment. The incubation buffer was exchanged for fresh buffer every other day for 30 days. At the end of this incubation period, all tibias were dried and weighed (Fig. 11), and x-rays of each tibia were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard Model 4380N Faxitron x-ray machine. Five tibias from each group were then separately demineralized in 1 ml of 150 mm HCl, and calcium and phosphate levels were determined in each acid extract. The remaining five tibias from each group were pooled according to treatment group and ground with an agate mortar. The resulting powders were first analyzed by XRD using a Scintag SDF 2000 x-ray diffractometer, and a portion of this powder was then analyzed by FTIR. The Calcification of Demineralized Tibias by Incubation in Rat Serum or Plasma—The initial test of the hypothesis that blood contains an agent that calcifies bone was carried out using newborn rat tibias that had been first freed of endogenous mineral by 72 h extraction with 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5, a procedure that also killed all cells originally found in the bone. The demineralized tibias were placed in 2 ml of serum from 40-day-old rats and incubated for 6 days at 37 °C. Fig. 1 shows that demineralized tibias that have been incubated for 6 days in rat serum stain intensely for calcification with Alizarin Red and that the pattern of staining matches that seen in the original tibia prior to demineralization, with intense staining for calcification in the bone in the midshaft region and absence of staining in the cartilaginous tissue at either end of the tibia. Fig. 2 shows that demineralized tibias that have been incubated for 6 days in rat serum also stain for calcification by von Kossa and that the microscopic pattern of calcification is identical to that seen in tibias prior to demineralization, with intense von Kossa staining for calcification in the type I collagen matrix of bone and no evidence for calcification in either the periosteum or in cartilaginous tissue at the bone ends. Examination of the same sections at higher magnification showed that the calcification induced by incubation of demineralized tibias in rat serum is discontinuous, with numerous discrete calcification foci that could reflect individual nucleation events (figure not shown). Identical von Kossa and Alizarin staining patterns were obtained using newborn tibias that had been demineralized in 150 mm HCl for 72 h, or using EDTA-demineralized tibias that had been subsequently extracted with acetone followed by 24-h incubation in 6 m guanidine HCl (data not shown). These results demonstrate that demineralization conditions do not affect the matrix specificity or extent of the serum-induced re-calcification of bone.Fig. 2Calcification of demineralized rat tibia, calvaria, and tendon by incubation in rat serum: von Kossa staining of tissue sections. Demineralized rat tibia, calvaria, and tendon were incubated for 6 days in 2 ml of rat serum or in 2 ml of a physiological buffer (1 mm Ca, 3 mm PO4, 0.12 m NaCl, 30 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4) as described in the Fig. 1 legend and then fixed for 24 h in formalin. 5-μm-thick sections were stained by von Kossa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The possible re-calcification of demineralized tibias during incubation in serum was further assessed by chemical analysis for calcium and phosphate. Table I shows that incubation in rat serum restored about 60% of the calcium and phosphate found in tibias prior to demineralization and that the molar calcium to phosphate ratio in re-calcified tibias (1.54) is comparable to the molar ratio in tibias prior to demineralization (1.51). Fig. 3 shows that the re-calcification of bone is accompanied by a 1 mm decline in serum calcium levels over the 6-day incubation period, with most of the decline occurring between the second and third days of incubation. The amount of calcium taken up by the tibia during the incubation (1.94 μmol; Table I) accounted for the 2 μmol of calcium removed from serum during the incubation (Fig. 3: 1 mm decline in 2 ml volume = 2 μmol).Table IAnalysis for calcium and phosphate in tibia, calvaria, and tendon samples after incubation for 6 days in rat serumTissueCalciumPO4μmolTibiaBefore demineralization3.232.14After demineralization<0.1aDetection limit, 0.1 μmol of calcium.<0.02bDetection limit, 0.02 μmol of phosphate.After incubation in serum1.941.26CalvariaBefore demineralization23.3617.16After demineralization<0.1aDetection limit, 0.1 μmol of calcium.<0.02bDetection limit, 0.02 μmol of phosphate.After incubation in serum2.631.77Calvaria (1/8 portion)Before demineralization2.982.23After demineralization<0.1aDetection limit, 0.1 μmol of calcium.<0.02bDetection limit, 0.02 μmol of phosphate.After incubation in serum1.751.34TendonBefore incubation in serum<0.1aDetection limit, 0.1 μmol of calcium.<0.02bDetection limit, 0.02 μmol of phosphate.After incubation in serum3.852.50a Detection limit, 0.1 μmol of calcium.b Detection limit, 0.02 μmol of phosphate. Open table in a new tab To determine whether the serum-induced re-calcification of demineralized bone might be a spontaneous process at the calcium and phosphate levels found in rat serum, demineralized tibias were incubated for 6 days in a physiological buffer that contained the same ionic calcium, phosphate, carbonate, and pH as rat serum. This control experiment showed that incubation in physiological buffer did not result in detectable staining for calcification with Alizarin Red (Fig. 1) or von Kossa (Fig. 2) and did not cause an uptake of calcium and phosphate by the bone matrix or a significant decline in medium calcium (data not shown). 3The physiological buffer did, however, sustain the growth of added hydroxyapatite crystals (data not shown). The failure of demineralized tibia to re-calcify in this buffer therefore shows that the EDTA treatment procedures used to decalcify bone removed all mineral from the matrix of the tibia. These results indicate that the calcification of demineralized rat bone during incubation in rat serum is not a spontaneous process driven solely by the ionic calcium, phosphate, temperature, and pH conditions of blood, but rather a process driven by a calcification agent found in rat blood. Additional experiments were carried out to determine whether the re-calcification activity of rat serum is affected by blood coagulation. In this experiment, serum and heparin plasma samples were obtained from the same rats and tested for their ability to cause the re-calcification of demineralized tibias. The results of these experiments showed that incubation of demineralized tibias for 6 days in heparin plasma resulted in Alizarin Red and von Kossa staining for calcification that were identical to the staining seen in demineralized tibias following incubation in serum from the same rat and caused an uptake of calcium and phosphate by tibias that was comparable to that seen in tibias incubated in serum (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the calcification-inducing activity of blood is not significantly affected by blood coagulation. The Calcification of Demineralized Calvarias by Incubation in Rat Serum or Plasma—Additional experiments were carried out to determine whether the membranous bone of newborn rat calvarias also calcifies spontaneously in serum. Newborn rat calvarias were first freed of endogenous mineral and cells by 72-h extraction with 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5, and then incubated in 2 ml of rat serum at 37 °C. Figs. 1 and 2 show that demineralized calvarias that had been incubated for 6 days in rat serum stained intensely for calcification with Alizarin Red and with von Kossa. Comparable staining was seen for demineralized calvarias that had been incubated for 6 days in heparin plasma (data not shown). Table I shows that incubation in rat serum restored about 11% of the calcium and phosphate found in calvarias prior to demineralization, and Fig. 3 shows that the re-calcification of demineralized calvarias is accompanied by a 1.6 mm decline in serum calcium levels over the 6-day incubation period. The amount of serum calcium taken up by calvarias during the incubation (2.6 μmol; Table I) is comparable to the 3.2 μmol of calcium removed from serum during the incubation. Demineralized calvarias incubated for 6 days in a physiological buffer that contained the same concentration of ionic calcium, phosphate, and carbonate and the same pH as found in rat serum did not stain for calcification (Figs. 1 and 2) and did not cause a decrease in medium calcium or an uptake of calcium and phosphate by the calvarias (data not shown). Table I shows that incubation in serum restored a far lower percentage of the original mineral to calvarias than to tibias. It seemed likely that the lower extent of calvaria re-calcification was attributable to the limited amount of calcium in the 2-ml serum aliquot, which is over 5-fold lower than the calcium content of calvarias prior to demineralization. To test this hypothesis, the re-calcification experiment was repeated with a 1/8 portion of demineralized calvaria, a portion comparable to a tibia in original mineral content. The extent of re-calcification seen in the 1/8 calvaria sample was comparable to that seen in a newborn tibia (Table I), which shows that there is no significant difference in the extent of re-calcification seen in these two bone matrices when the same amount of bone is used. The Calcification of Tendon by Incubation in Rat Serum or Plasma—The above experiments demonstrate that calcification induced by incubation of demineralized tibias and calvarias in rat serum is restricted to those matrix regions that were calcified in the original bone. This pattern of calcification could indicate that agents that remained in the bone structures after demineralization promote the serum-induced calcification. Alternatively, serum-induced calcification could be specific for an extracellular matrix of type I collagen, which is the matrix found in bone, tendon, and other connective tissues. To test the second possibility, tail tendons from 40-day-old rats were incubated in 2 ml of rat serum at 37 °C. Figs. 1 and 2 show that tendons that have been incubated for 6 days in rat serum stain intensely for calcification with Alizarin Red and with von Kossa, Table I shows that incubation in rat serum caused a dramatic accumulation of calcium and phosphate in tendons, and Fig. 3 shows that this tendon calcification is accompanied by a corresponding decline in serum calcium levels over the 6-day incubation period. Comparable results were also seen for tendons that had been incubated for 6 days in heparin plasma (data not shown). Tendons incubated for 6 days in a physiological buffer that contained the same concentration of ionic calcium, phosphate, and carbonate and the same pH as found in rat serum did not stain for calcification (Figs. 1 and 2) and did not cause a decrease in medium calcium or an uptake of calcium and phosphate by the tendon (data not shown). The Calcification of Tendons and Demineralized Tibias by Incubation in DMEM Containing Different Amounts of Rat Serum—The potency of the serum factor that initiates the re-calcification of demineralized bone was assessed by determining whether demineralized rat tibias would calcify when incubated in DMEM cell culture medium containing different amounts of rat serum. Fig. 4 shows that demineralized tibias that have been incubated for 6 days in DMEM containing 1.5 or 15% rat serum stain intensely for calcification with Alizarin Red and that the pattern of staining matches that seen in the original tibia prior to demineralization (cf. Fig. 1). Table II shows that demineralized tibias incubated for 6 days in DMEM containing 15% or 1.5% rat serum have dramatically increased levels of calcium and phosphate compared with tibias incubated in DMEM alone, with a 3-fold greater accumulation of calcium and phosphate at 15% serum than at 1.5% serum. Demineralized tibias that have been incubated for 6 days in DMEM containing 15% or 1.5% rat serum also stained for calcification by von Kossa; the microscopic pattern of this calcification was discontinuous, with numerous discrete calcification foci scattered in the extracellular bone matrix (not shown). The number of these foci was markedly lower for tibias recalcified in DMEM with 1.5% serum. Demineralized tibias that had been incubated for 6 days in DMEM alone, or in DMEM containing 0.15% rat serum, did not stain for calcification with Alizarin Red (Fig. 4) or von Kossa (not shown) and did not have a significant uptake of calcium and phosphate (Table II). This experiment has been repeated using fresh and frozen rat serum, and fresh and frozen rat heparin plasma, and in each instance demineralized tibias incubated for 6 days in DMEM containing 1.5% serum or plasma became calcified, whereas tibias incubated in DMEM containing 0.15% serum or plasma did not (not shown).Table IIAnalysis for calcium and phosphate in tibia and tendon samples after incubation for 6 days in DMEM containing rat serumTissueCalciumPO4μmolTibiaBefore demineralization3.22.1After demineralization<0.1aDetection limit, 0.1 μmol of calcium.<0.02bDetection limit, 0.02 μmol of phosphate.After incubation in media0.14<0.02bDetection limit, 0.02 μmol of phosphate.After incubation in 0.15% serum in media0.120.05After incubation in 1.5% serum in media0.380.17After incubation in 15% serum in media2.21.3TendonBefore incubation in media<0.1aDetection limit, 0.1 μmol of calcium.<0.02bDetection limit, 0.02 μmol of phosphate.After incubation in media0.08<0.02bDetection limit, 0.02 μmol of phosphate.After incubation in 0.15% serum in media1.30.72After incubation in 1.5% serum in media5.13.1After incubation in 15% serum in media4.93.0a Detection limit, 0.1 μmol of calcium.b Detection limit, 0.02 μmol of phosphate.

In this study, we developed an integrated strategy to discover cell surface proteins associated with diabetes and to test their role in endothelial dysfunction. First, a peptide phage display library was screened over the endothelial surface of the intact aorta or in retinal endothelial cells from diabetic and control rats. Then, we purified profilin-1 as a binding partner for one of the diabetic aorta-specific phage. Profilin was increased in the aortic endothelium of human diabetic individuals and streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Furthermore, overexpressing profilin in rat aortic endothelial cells triggered 3 indicators of endothelial dysfunction: increased apoptosis, elevated expression of ICAM-1, and decreased phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, a marker for nitric oxide signaling. The changes in ICAM-1 and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein were recapitulated in the diabetic aorta in vivo. LDL and oxysterols elevated profilin in cultured aortic endothelial cells. Interference with the de novo synthesis of profilin abrogated the LDL-mediated increase in ICAM-1 expression. Finally, profilin expression was markedly elevated in atherosclerotic plaques. These data indicate that profilin contributes to endothelial dysfunction in a pathway that is downstream of LDL."

AMP inhibition is cooperative (Hill coefficient of 2) and competitive with respect to divalent metal cations and noncompetitive with respect to substrate (10Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol.

Porcine FBPase, the most extensively studied of all of the FBPases, is a homotetramer of subunit molecular mass of 37 kDa (13Stone S.R. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 620-625Google Scholar).

A dynamic loop (residues 52–72) interacts with the active site (engaged conformation), providing one side chain (Asp68) for metal coordination and orienting other side chains (Glu97 and Asp74) essential to catalysis (16Choe J.-Y.

T-state FBPase (found in the presence of AMP) stabilizes the loop in a conformation withdrawn from the active site (disengaged conformation). Mutations that destabilize the engaged conformation of loop 52–72 reduce FBPase activity and Mg2+ affinity, whereas mutations that destabilize the disengaged conformation lessen AMP inhibition without causing significant change to the binding affinity of an AMP analogue for the allosteric site (20Nelson S.W. Choe J.-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29986-29992Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding and kinetic experiments are in apparent conflict regarding the stoichiometry and cooperativity of metal cation association with FBPase. Benkovic et al. (23Benkovic P.A.

Binding studies of metal activators in the absence of substrate, however, preclude significant interactions between metal cations and the 1-phosphoryl group of F16P2 (12Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J.

Horecker and colleagues (24Pontremoli S. Sparatore B. Salamino F. Melloni E. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 481-485Google Scholar) observed positive cooperativity in the binding of Mn2+ to high affinity sites and independent binding to sites of low affinity and detected a third class of metal binding sites in the presence of a substrate analog. In contrast, Mg2+-positive cooperativity is unequivocal in the kinetics of FBPase at pH 7 (7Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Google Scholar) and yet at pH 9.6, Mg2+ cooperativity disappears (9Zhang R. Villeret V. Lipscomb W.N. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 3038-3043Google Scholar). Cooperativity in Mg2+ activation of FBPase can arise in principle from steady-state kinetics or from thermodynamic coupling between metal binding sites. Individual terms for ligand concentrations in the general relationship for a steady-state Random Bi Bi kinetic mechanism are of order two (25Fromm S.J. Fromm H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 448-452Google Scholar). However, second order terms disappear for a Random Bi Bi kinetic mechanism in which all of the rates of transition are fast relative to those governing the interconversion of the ternary substrate- and product-enzyme complexes (rapid-equilibrium condition). Hence, the transition from a noncooperative system at pH 9.6 to a cooperative system at pH 7 could be attributed to the departure from rapid-equilibrium kinetics. Mg2+ cooperativity could occur then even for a single set of independent binding sites. If the kinetic mechanism remains rapid-equilibrium at pH 7.5, however, cooperativity in Mg2+ activation necessarily comes from the thermodynamic coupling of two or more binding sites for metal cations. Recent crystal structures of the R-state enzyme reveal ordered binding sites for two Mg2+ and the binding of a third Mg2+ to mutually exclusive third and fourth sites (18Choe J.-Y. Iancu C.V. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 166015-166020Google Scholar). Side chains of Asp118 and Glu97 coordinate pairs of metal cations, and a phosphoryl species (at the 1-phosphoryl site) coordinates all three metal cations. Hence, crystal structures present several avenues for thermodynamic coupling between metal sites within a subunit. Coupling between metal sites of different subunits, however, is also a possibility. The two structural domains of the FBPase subunit undergo a 2–3° reorientation as metal cations bind to the active site (16Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Google Scholar). A metal-induced movement of domains within one subunit could influence the free energy of metal association in neighboring subunits. Presented here are data that bear directly on Mg2+ cooperativity in FBPase. A thorough study of the kinetic mechanism of FBPase at pH 7.5 is fully consistent with rapid-equilibrium kinetics. Mg2+ cooperativity then most probably comes from the thermodynamic coupling of metal binding sites. In principle, the functional properties of hybrid oligomeric enzymes can reveal whether coupling occurs between sites of the same subunit or different subunits (26Gibbons I. Ritchey J.M. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1324-1330Google Scholar, 27Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Google Scholar, 28Nelson S.W.

Mutations of residues that directly coordinate metal cations (Asp121, Asp118, or Glu97) inactivate FBPase, and yet hybrid tetramers with one wild-type subunit and three mutant subunits retain Mg2+ cooperativity. Results from metal binding, kinetics, and structural studies then are all consistent with intrasubunit coupling of metal binding sites as the basis for Mg2+ cooperativity in FBPase.

Other chemicals were reagent grade or equivalent. QSW-HR HPLC resin was from Toso-Hass Bioseparations. FBPase-deficient Escherichia coli strain DF 657 came from the Genetic Stock Center, Yale University. Plasmids used in the expression of Glu-tagged FBPase came from a previous investigation (28Nelson S.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15539-15545Google Scholar). All of the oligonucleotides came from Sigma. Mutagenesis of Wild-type FBPase—Specific base changes in double-stranded plasmids employed QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Individual mutations of Asp121, Asp118, and Glu97 to alanine on the Glu-tagged plasmid were accomplished with primers 5′-GGTCTGTTTTGATCCCCTCGCGGGATCGTCGAACATC-3′, 5′-GGTAAATACGTGGTCTGTTTTGCGCCCCTCGATGGATCG-3′, and 5′-GCGTTCTCGTGTCAGCGGAAGATAAAAACGCC-3′, respectively. Primers for the second mutagenesis reaction are the reverse complements of the forward primers. Results from mutagenesis were confirmed by sequencing the promoter region and the entire open reading frame. The Iowa State University sequencing facility provided DNA sequences using the fluorescent dye-dideoxy terminator method. Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Homotetramers—Wild-type and mutant FBPases were expressed in E. coli strain DF 657 and purified to homogeneity. Cell-free extracts of the wild-type, wild-type Glu-tagged, and mutant Glu-tagged homotetramers were subjected to heat treatment (65 °C for 5 min) followed by centrifugation. The supernatant fluid was loaded onto a Cibracon Blue-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. FBPases were eluted from that column by 5 mm AMP in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The eluent was loaded directly onto a DEAE-Sepharose column and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–0.3 m) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Wild-type and Glu-tagged enzymes eluted at ∼0.1 and 0.25 m NaCl, respectively. Protein purity and concentration was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and the Bradford assay (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Google Scholar), respectively. Formation and Purification of Hybrid Enzymes—Only pure enzymes were used in hybridization procedures. Wild-type and mutant FBPases were combined and incubated overnight at 4 °C, after which the mixture was loaded onto a QSW-HR HPLC column previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Individual hybrids were eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–0.3 m) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Anion exchange chromatography separated FBPase tetramers by variations in net charge because of the numbers and relative placement of Glu-tagged subunits. Assignment of specific hybrid types to eluted peaks employed methods and considerations described previously (28Nelson S.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15539-15545Google Scholar, 29Nelson S.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 254-258Google Scholar). Once isolated, hybrid tetramers were maintained at room temperature to retard further subunit exchange. All of the kinetics data were acquired within 2 h of hybrid purification, after which hybrid enzymes were re-examined using native PAGE. These gels confirmed the absence of subunit rearrangement. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded for wild type, mutants, and hybrid FBPases at room temperature on a Jasco J710 CD spectrometer using a 1-cm cell and a protein concentration of 0.35 mg/ml. Spectra were collected from 200 to 260 nm in increments of 1.3 nm. Each spectrum, an average of three independent scans, was blank-corrected using the software package provided with the instrument. Kinetic Experiments—Assays for the determination of specific activity, kcat, and activity ratios at pH 7.5 and 9.5 employed the coupling enzymes, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1Benkovic S.T. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82Google Scholar). The reduction of NADP+ to NADPH was monitored by absorbance spectroscopy at 340 nm. All of the other assays used the same coupling enzymes but monitored the production of NADPH by fluorescence emission at 470 nm using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Assays were performed at room temperature (22 °C). Initial velocities were determined by using the software Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Inc.). Kinetic Mechanism of the Wild-type Enzyme—The kinetic mechanism of FBPase was determined at pH 7.5 by the measurement of initial velocities at various concentrations of Mg2+ and F16P2. Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity against free F16P2 and Mg2+ concentrations (Fig. 1) revealed families of intersecting lines indicative of a sequential mechanism in which the formation of a complete active-site complex must precede the rate-limiting step. Fits of data to functional forms representing a variety of kinetic mechanisms clearly established Equation 1 as the best relationship with the fewest degrees of freedom, v=(Vmax⋅A2⋅B)/(A2⋅B+Ka⋅B+Kb⋅A2+Kia⋅Kb)(Eq. 1) where Vmax, A, B, Ka, Kb, and Kia represent the maximum velocity of the reaction, the concentration of free Mg2+, the concentration of free F16P2, the Michaelis-Menten constant for Mg2+, the Michaelis-Menten constant for F16P2, and the dissociation constant for Mg2+, respectively. Acceptable fits using data at pH 7.5 require the second order term in the concentration of free Mg2+. Kinetic parameters determined by the fit to Equation 1 are indicated in Table I.Table IValues for parameters of Scheme I determined by fits of Equation 1 to the data in Fig. 1ConstantEnzyme interactionValueKiaE + 2Mg2+ ⇔ E · (Mg2+)20.35 ± 0.07 mm2KibE + F16P2 ⇔ E · F16P20.9 ± 0.2 μmKaE·F16P2 + 2Mg2+ ⇔ E·F16P2·(Mg2+)20.74 ± 0.05 mm2KbE·(Mg2+)2 + F16P2 ⇔ E·F16P2·(Mg2+)22.0 ± 0.1 μm Open table in a new tab Equation 1 is valid for rapid-equilibrium Random Ter Ter and steady-state Ordered Ter Ter kinetic mechanisms in which two Mg2+ bind in a single step (Hill coefficient constrained to two). The response of the system to competitive inhibitors can distinguish between random and ordered mechanisms (32Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Google Scholar). Cd2+ and F26P2 inhibit FBPase competitively with respect to Mg2+ (10Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Google Scholar) and F16P2 (4Van Schaftingen E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1987; 59: 45-82Google Scholar), respectively. For a random mechanism, the competitive inhibitor of one substrate should be a noncompetitive inhibitor of the other substrate, whereas for an ordered mechanism, the competitive inhibitor of the second substrate should be an uncompetitive inhibitor of the first substrate. The appropriate double reciprocal plots (Fig. 2) clearly indicate noncompetitive inhibition of FBPase by Cd2+ and F26P2 with respect to Mg2+ and F16P2, respectively, hence a random mechanism. Data from Fig. 2a were fit to a model for linear noncompetitive inhibition as shown in Equation 2, v=(Vmax⋅A2⋅B)/{Kb⋅A2+Kia⋅Kb⋅(1+I/Kix)+A2⋅B+Ka⋅(1+I/Kiix)⋅B}(Eq. 2) where Vmax, A, B, Ka, Kb, and Kia are defined as in Equation 1, I is the concentration of Cd2+, and Kix and Kiix are equilibrium constants defined in Table II. In fitting the data of Fig. 2a, the concentration of Mg2+ (symbolized by A) is fixed, whereas concentrations of F16P2 and Cd2+ (symbolized by B and I, respectively) vary. Numerical values for Ka, Kb, and Kia come from Table I. Vmax, Kix, and Kiix are the adjustable parameters with optimized values reported for Kix and Kiix in Table II. Data from Fig. 2b were fit to a model for linear noncompetitive inhibition as well as shown in Equation 3, v=(Vmax⋅A2⋅B)/{Ka⋅B+Kia⋅Kb⋅(1+I/Kiy)+A2⋅B+Kb⋅(1+I/Kiiy)⋅A2}(Eq. 3) where Vmax, A, B, Ka, Kb, and Kia are defined as in Equation 1, I is the concentration of F26P2, and Kiy and Kiiy are equilibrium constants defined in Table II. For the data of Fig. 2b, the concentration of F16P2 (symbolized by B) is fixed, whereas concentrations of Mg2+ and F26P2 (symbolized by A and I, respectively) vary. Vmax, Kiy and Kiiy are optimized with values assigned to Ka, Kb, and Kia from Table I. Numerical values for Kiy and Kiiy appear in Table II.Table IIConstants for the inhibition of FBPase by F26P2 and Cd2+ determined by fits of Equations 2 and 3 to the data of Fig. 2ConstantEquilibrium conditionValuenmKixE + Cd2+ ⇔ E·Cd2+300 ± 100KiixE·F16P2 + Cd2+ ⇔ E·F16P2 ⇔ Cd2+96 ± 5KiyE + F26P2 ⇔ E·F26P239 ± 5KiiyE·Mg2+ + F26P2 ⇔ E·F26P2·Mg2+150 ± 10 Open table in a new tab A kinetic mechanism that accounts for the data in Figs. 1 and 2 is in Scheme I. All of the steps are in rapid-equilibrium relative to the breakdown of the quaternary E·(Mg2+)2·F16P2 complex. The data are fully consistent with a rapid-equilibrium Random Ter Ter mechanism, the central complex of which must have at least two magnesium cations. Expression, Purification, and Secondary Structure of FBPase Constructs—Wild-type and mutant FBPases behaved consistently through purification, becoming at least 95% pure on the basis of SDS-PAGE and native PAGE (data not shown). Furthermore, subunit exchange between wild type and wild-type Glu-tagged homotetramers proceeded at rates identical to those of wild type and mutant Glu-tagged homotetramers (t½ = 1 h). Hybrid enzymes eluted over six peaks from HPLC-DEAE chromatography (Fig. 3). Hybrid tetramers with one wild-type subunit and three mutant Glu-tagged subunits (1:3 hybrid enzymes) were resolved by HPLC-DEAE chromatography and native PAGE electrophoresis (Fig. 4). Circular dichroism spectra of wild type, mutant homotetramers, and equilibrium hybrid mixtures are identical from 200 to 260 nm (data not shown), indicating consistent folding and secondary structure for the constructs used here.Fig. 4Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified hybrids. Each lane is labeled for its hybrid composition: Mix, equilibrium mixture of wild type and Glu-tagged mutant tetramers; 4:0, wild-type tetramer; 3:1, hybrid tetramer with three wild-type subunits and one mutant Glu-tagged subunit; 2:2q+r, unresolved mixture of tetramers with single mutant Glu-tagged subunits in opposite halves (top/bottom) of the FBPase tetramer; 2:2p, hybrid tetramer with two mutant Glu-tagged subunits in the same half of the tetramer; 1:3, hybrid tetramer with one wild-type subunit and three mutant Glu-tagged subunits; 0:4, tetramer with four mutant Glu-tagged subunits. Identification of 1:3 hybrid type is based on its electrophoretic and chromatographic mobilities relative to the complete hybrid mixture as described in Ref. 28Nelson S.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15539-15545Google Scholar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Kinetics of Hybrid Enzymes—Hybrid enzymes were used in experiments immediately following their purification. Kinetic parameters for wild type, wild-type Glu-tagged, and 1:3 hybrid enzymes are in Table III. Mutant Glu-tagged homotetramers exhibited no activity over a wide range of assay conditions (pH 7.5–9.5, Mg2+ concentrations of up to 50 mm, enzyme concentrations of up to 10 mg/ml, and assay times as long as 10 min). Assay conditions at elevated enzyme concentrations and increased times place an upper limit on the activity of 10-7 relative to that of the wild-type enzyme. Wild type and wild-type Glu-tagged homotetramers have virtually identical kinetic parameters. Hybrid enzymes of Ala97, Ala118, and Ala121 mutant subunits are 24 ± 6, 18 ± 7, and 26 ± 7%, respectively, as active as wild-type FBPase. Wild-type and hybrid enzymes exhibit similar curves for Mg2+ activation (Fig. 5). Ka values for Mg2+ decreased no >2-fold for hybrid enzymes relative to that of wild-type FBPase. Hybrid enzymes have Hill coefficients for Mg2+ ranging from 1.8 to 2.0. Only the Ki for F26P2 of the wild type:Asp121 → Ala (1:3) hybrid tetramer shows significant change, being 5-fold higher than that of the wild-type homotetramer. AMP is a cooperative inhibitor of all 1:3 hybrid tetramers with 4-fold increases in IC50 values for the wild-type:Asp121 → Ala and wild type:Asp118→ Ala (1:3) hybrid tetramers.Table IIIKinetic parameters for wild-type, Glu-tagged, and 1:3 hybrid FBPases Assays employed 0.1 mm EDTA.

(33Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Google Scholar) and Koshland et al. (34Koshland Jr., D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Google Scholar) link cooperative phenomena to transitions between conformational states. By all measures, the R-state is the predominant form of FBPase in the absence of ligands. The addition of AMP drives an R- to T-state transition, which probably accounts for AMP cooperativity. However, Mg2+, which is an antagonist of AMP, can only stabilize an enzyme already in the R-state. Hence, the known quaternary transition of FBPase is an unlikely basis for Mg2+ cooperativity. Random two-substrate kinetic mechanisms, however, can exhibit apparent cooperativity as noted in the Introduction. FBPase behaves as a two-substrate system at pH 9.6 (rapid-equilibrium Random Bi Bi kinetic mechanism with one Mg2+ and one F16P2 molecule forming a ternary complex with the active site (10Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Google Scholar)). At pH 7.5, the kinetic mechanism changes, becoming steady-state Random Bi Bi, rapid-equilibrium Random Ter Ter, or steady-state Ordered Ter Ter. Data here eliminate a steady-state Ordered Ter Ter kinetic mechanism and are consistent with a rapid-equilibrium Random Ter Ter mechanism. Kinetic data alone, however, cannot exclude a steady-state Random Bi Bi mechanism. Nonetheless, metal binding studies (23Benkovic P.A. Caperelli C.A. de Maine M. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2185-2189Google Scholar, 24Pontremoli S. Sparatore B. Salamino F. Melloni E. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 481-485Google Scholar) and recent crystal structures of product complexes (16Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Google Scholar, 17Choe J.-Y. Nelson S.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 166008-166014Google Scholar, 18Choe J.-Y. Iancu C.V. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 166015-166020Google Scholar) favor multiple binding sites for metal cations. The rapid-equilibrium Random Ter Ter mechanism requires multiple metal binding sites, whereas the steady-state Random Bi Bi mechanism allows only a single metal binding site. Of the kinetic mechanisms considered here, only the rapid-equilibrium Random Ter Ter scheme accounts for the full spectrum of data from kinetics, equilibrium binding, and structural studies. Mg2+ and F16P2 interactions with the enzyme are not synergistic as evidenced by the kinetic data. Individual curves in Fig. 1 converge below the x axis, indicating higher values for Michaelis-Menten constants (Ka and Kb in Scheme I) than for dissociation constants (Kia and Kib). The presence of the first ligand could sterically hinder the binding of the second ligand. Alternatively, both ligands in combination may divert binding energy to promote the transition state, as for instance, a conformational change in loop 52–72 to its engaged conformation. F26P2 binds also with lower affinity in the presence of Mg2+ than in its absence (10Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Google Scholar). Because the concentration of Mg2+ in vivo is constant and high enough to completely saturate the enzyme, the Michaelis-Menten constant of F16P2 (Kb in Scheme I) may reflect substrate affinity more accurately than the dissociation constant (Kib). By similar reasoning, Kiiy may better represent the affinity of F26P2 for FBPase in vivo than does Kiy. Unlike Mg2+, Cd2+ binds synergistically with F16P2. Cd2+ has a higher affinity for the E·F16P2 complex than for the enzyme alone. Cd2+ inhibits the enzyme without cooperativity, consistent with independent binding to a single set of sites. The larger size of Cd2+ relative to Mg2+ runs contrary to steric conflict as an explanation for Mg2+-F16P2 antagonism; however, if Cd2+ and F16P2 together cannot divert free energy to promote conformational change (movement of loop 52–72 perhaps), then what appears as binding antagonism for Mg2+ and F16P2 could become binding synergism for Cd2+ and F16P2. Asp121 coordinates Mg2+ at site 1, Asp118 coordinates Mg2+ at sites 1 and 2, and Glu97 coordinates Mg2+ at sites 2 and 3 (Fig. 6). The absence of measurable turnover for the Ala118, Ala121, and Ala97 mutant proteins is consistent then with the essential role played by divalent cations in FBPase activity. By way of comparison, the Ala121 mutation of rat liver FBPase causes a 50,000-fold reduction in activity (35El-Maghrabi M.R. Gidh-Jain M. Austin L.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9466-9472Google Scholar). Reasons for the discrepancy between Ala121 FBPases from rat and pig are unclear; however, even a relative activity (mutant versus wild-type enzyme) as high as 10-3 is insignificant in relation to the ∼25% relative activity of the 1:3 hybrid tetramers studied here. Intersubunit coupling is a favored explanation for Mg2+ cooperativity in FBPase kinetics (7Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Google Scholar), even though no direct evidence supports such a mechanism to the exclusion of other possibilities. Mutations here disrupt all of the possible interactions between metal sites of different subunits, and yet all of the 1:3 hybrid enzymes retain Mg2+ cooperativity. The latter infers a coupling mechanism between metal sites within a single subunit. However, which of the metal binding sites are coupled? One site has a high affinity for metal, requiring 2 weeks of dialysis to completely remove divalent cations from it (23Benkovic P.A. Caperelli C.A. de Maine M. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2185-2189Google Scholar). Crystals of FBPase grown in the presence of AMP and Mg2+ retain metal only at site 1 (12Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Google Scholar). Hence, site 1 is the only reasonable candidate for the high affinity binding site for divalent cations. Moreover, for all of the concentrations of Mg2+ employed in assays, the metal cation may fully occupy site 1, eliminating it from consideration in cooperative phenomenon. To observe a Hill coefficient of two, sites 2 and 3 must be coupled and, in crystal structures with Mg2+ at neutral pH, Glu97 bridges metal cations at sites 2 and 3 (17Choe J.-Y. Nelson S.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 166008-166014Google Scholar, 18Choe J.-Y. Iancu C.V. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 166015-166020Google Scholar). In a crystal structure at pH 9, Glu97 coordinates metals at sites 1 and 2 and a third metal occupies mutually exclusive sites 3 and 4. The loss of Glu97 to site 3 is in harmony with the loss of Mg2+ cooperativity in FBPase kinetics above pH 9. If FBPase can generate metaphosphate in its active site, as recent evidence suggests (18Choe J.-Y. Iancu C.V. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 166015-166020Google Scholar), a hydroxide ion (the concentration of which in bulk solvent is a 100-fold higher at pH 9.5 than at 7.5) could react without the benefit of a metal cation at site 3. Mutagenesis experiments are in agreement with the analysis above. Mutations of Asn64 and Asp68, residues that make up part of metal site 3, or mutations within the loop 52–72 lower the pH 7.5/9.5 activity ratio, decrease Mg2+ affinity, and reduce or eliminate Mg2+ cooperativity (19Kurbanov F.T. Choe J.-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17511-17516Google Scholar, 20Nelson S.W. Choe J.-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29986-29992Google Scholar). Additionally, the mutation of Arg276, a residue near metal site 3, eliminates Mg2+ cooperativity (36Zhang R. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8190-8195Google Scholar), most probably by destabilizing the engaged conformation of loop 52–72 (16Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Google Scholar). Although 1:3 hybrid FBPases evidently exclude site coupling between subunits as a basis for Mg2+ cooperativity, the 5-fold increase in the Ki for F26P2 exhibited by the wild type:Asp121 → Ala (1:3) hybrid enzyme implies some mechanism of coupling between the F26P2 binding site and metal sites 1 in neighboring subunits (Fig. 7). Site 1 differs in at least one respect from other metal sites. Side chains from both the F16P2 and AMP binding domains of the FBPase subunit coordinate the site 1 metal, whereas sites 2 and 3 lie entirely within the AMP domain. The relative orientation of the AMP and F16P2 domains differs by 2–3° between metal-free and metal-product complexes of R-state FB-Pase (16Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Google Scholar). This 2–3° re-orientation of domains was originally attributed to the R- to T-state transition (14Ke H. Liang J.-Y. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4412-4420Google Scholar), but superpositions of subunits from T-state and R-state complexes of FBPase with bound metals show no domain re-orientation (12Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Google Scholar, 16Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Google Scholar). Furthermore, the two F16P2 domains of a C1–C2 subunit pair have fixed orientations with respect to each other, a consequence of numerous bridging salt links and hydrogen bonds. (Arg243 from subunit C1, for instance, hydrogen bonds with the 6-phosphoryl group of the substrate in subunit C2). Hence, the binding or loss of metal at site 1 in one subunit should affect the neighboring subunit in the C1–C2 pair. This coupling mechanism, however, has no effect on the kinetics of wild-type FBPase, probably because divalent cations always saturate site 1 in assays. What is unexpected in the functional properties of the wild type:Asp121 → Ala (1:3) hybrid enzyme is not necessarily the 5-fold increase in the Ki for F26P2 but the absence of any effect on the Kb for F16P2. Significant differences in the effect of mutations on kinetic parameters for F16P2 and F26P2, however, are not unprecedented. The mutation of Arg243 or Lys274 to alanine increases the Ki for F26P2 by 1000-fold but increases the Kb for F16P2 only modestly (10–20-fold) (37Giroux E. Williams M.K. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31404-31409Google Scholar, 38El-Maghrabi M.R. Austin L.R. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6526-6530Google Scholar). Clearly, FBPase recognizes F16P2 and F26P2 differently, but from a structural perspective, these differences are not yet fully understood. The results presented here support a mechanism in which the metal at site 1 remains bound throughout the catalytic cycle of FBPase and metals at sites 2 and 3 are solely responsible for cooperativity. This three-metal system is consistent with crystal structures of product complexes of FBPase (16Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Google Scholar, 17Choe J.-Y. Nelson S.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 166008-166014Google Scholar, 18Choe J.-Y. Iancu C.V. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 166015-166020Google Scholar). Moreover, several different phosphatase enzymes, for instance, alkaline phosphatase, phospholipase C, and the bifunctional enzyme inositol manophosphatase/FBPase from Methanococcus jannaschii, may employ similar mechanisms (39Stec B.

Further examination of the human inositol monophosphatase catalytic mechanism suggests that it too uses a three-metal mechanism (41Johnson K.A. Chen L. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Stec B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 618-630Google Scholar). The three-metal mechanism then may be broadly applicable to enzymes that cleave phosphate esters."
