High on the list of nano-technologists' wants is a molecular motor that can move ‘micro-scale’ objects much larger than the motor itself. One a bit like the device pictured here and in a QuickTime movie on nature.com in fact. This is a synthetic, light-driven molecular motor embedded in a liquid-crystal film that rotates objects 10,000 times bigger than itself. Changes in the motor's shape during the rotary steps cause the liquid-crystal film and its surface relief to reorganize, which in turn causes the submillimetre-sized particles on the film to rotate. Nanomachines of the future will require molecular-scale motors1,2,3,4,5,6 that can perform work and collectively induce controlled motion of much larger objects. We have designed a synthetic, light-driven molecular motor that is embedded in a liquid-crystal film and can rotate objects placed on the film that exceed the size of the motor molecule by a factor of 10,000. The changes in shape of the motor during the rotary steps cause a remarkable rotational reorganization of the liquid-crystal film and its surface relief, which ultimately causes the rotation of submillimetre-sized particles on the film."
https://openalex.org/W2101553897,"The 9 + 2 microtubule axoneme of flagella and cilia represents one of the most iconic structures built by eukaryotic cells and organisms. Both unity and diversity are present among cilia and flagella on the evolutionary as well as the developmental scale. Some cilia are motile, whereas others function as sensory organelles and can variously possess 9 + 2 and 9 + 0 axonemes and other associated structures. How such unity and diversity are reflected in molecular repertoires is unclear. The flagellated protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, causing devastating disease in humans and other animals. There is little hope of a vaccine for African sleeping sickness and a desperate need for modern drug therapies. Here we present a detailed proteomic analysis of the trypanosome flagellum. RNA interference (RNAi)-based interrogation of this proteome provides functional insights into human ciliary diseases and establishes that flagellar function is essential to the bloodstream-form trypanosome. We show that RNAi-mediated ablation of various proteins identified in the trypanosome flagellar proteome leads to a rapid and marked failure of cytokinesis in bloodstream-form (but not procyclic insect-form) trypanosomes, suggesting that impairment of flagellar function may provide a method of disease control. A postgenomic meta-analysis, comparing the evolutionarily ancient trypanosome with other eukaryotes including humans, identifies numerous trypanosome-specific flagellar proteins, suggesting new avenues for selective intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1974229450,"The glomerular filtration barrier in the kidney is formed in part by a specialized intercellular junction known as the slit diaphragm, which connects adjacent actin-based foot processes of kidney epithelial cells (podocytes). Mutations affecting a number of slit diaphragm proteins, including nephrin (encoded by NPHS1), lead to renal disease owing to disruption of the filtration barrier and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, although the molecular basis for this is unclear. Here we show that nephrin selectively binds the Src homology 2 (SH2)/SH3 domain-containing Nck adaptor proteins, which in turn control the podocyte cytoskeleton in vivo. The cytoplasmic tail of nephrin has multiple YDxV sites that form preferred binding motifs for the Nck SH2 domain once phosphorylated by Src-family kinases. We show that this Nck-nephrin interaction is required for nephrin-dependent actin reorganization. Selective deletion of Nck from podocytes of transgenic mice results in defects in the formation of foot processes and in congenital nephrotic syndrome. Together, these findings identify a physiological signalling pathway in which nephrin is linked through phosphotyrosine-based interactions to Nck adaptors, and thus to the underlying actin cytoskeleton in podocytes. Simple and widely expressed SH2/SH3 adaptor proteins can therefore direct the formation of a specialized cellular morphology in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1979411326,"Nitrous acid is a significant photochemical precursor of the hydroxyl radical, the key oxidant in the degradation of most air pollutants in the troposphere. The sources of nitrous acid in the troposphere, however, are still poorly understood. Recent atmospheric measurements revealed a strongly enhanced formation of nitrous acid during daytime via unknown mechanisms. Here we expose humic acid films to nitrogen dioxide in an irradiated tubular gas flow reactor and find that reduction of nitrogen dioxide on light-activated humic acids is an important source of gaseous nitrous acid. Our findings indicate that soil and other surfaces containing humic acid exhibit an organic surface photochemistry that produces reductive surface species, which react selectively with nitrogen dioxide. The observed rate of nitrous acid formation could explain the recently observed high daytime concentrations of nitrous acid in the boundary layer, the photolysis of which accounts for up to 60 per cent of the integrated hydroxyl radical source strengths. We suggest that this photo-induced nitrous acid production on humic acid could have a potentially significant impact on the chemistry of the lowermost troposphere."
https://openalex.org/W2029644817,"Complex movements such as walking or swimming are produced by networks of nerve cells embedded in the spinal cord. A new study in mice has identified, for the first time, a subset of such nerve cells that controls the speed of locomotion. A unique combination of genetic and electrophysiological techniques reveals how these cells help set the rhythmic activity of spinal cord neurons. This work should be of interest to those studying neurological disorders. Intriguingly the V1 neurons that serve this function are conserved between swimming and walking vertebrates. The neuronal networks that generate vertebrate movements such as walking and swimming are embedded in the spinal cord1,2,3. These networks, which are referred to as central pattern generators (CPGs), are ideal systems for determining how ensembles of neurons generate simple behavioural outputs. In spite of efforts to address the organization of the locomotor CPG in walking animals2,4,5,6, little is known about the identity and function of the spinal interneuron cell types that contribute to these locomotor networks. Here we use four complementary genetic approaches to directly address the function of mouse V1 neurons, a class of local circuit inhibitory interneurons that selectively express the transcription factor Engrailed1. Our results show that V1 neurons shape motor outputs during locomotion and are required for generating ‘fast’ motor bursting. These findings outline an important role for inhibition in regulating the frequency of the locomotor CPG rhythm, and also suggest that V1 neurons may have an evolutionarily conserved role in controlling the speed of vertebrate locomotor movements."
https://openalex.org/W2033901847,"Drosophila colour vision is achieved by R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells present in every ommatidium. The fly retina contains two types of ommatidia, called ‘pale’ and ‘yellow’, defined by different rhodopsin pairs expressed in R7 and R8 cells. Similar to the human cone photoreceptors, these ommatidial subtypes are distributed stochastically in the retina. The choice between pale versus yellow ommatidia is made in R7 cells, which then impose their fate onto R8. Here we report that the Drosophila dioxin receptor Spineless is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the ommatidial mosaic. A short burst of spineless expression at mid-pupation in a large subset of R7 cells precedes rhodopsin expression. In spineless mutants, all R7 and most R8 cells adopt the pale fate, whereas overexpression of spineless is sufficient to induce the yellow R7 fate. Therefore, this study suggests that the entire retinal mosaic required for colour vision is defined by the stochastic expression of a single transcription factor, Spineless."
https://openalex.org/W1510322961,"Covalent carbon–carbon bonds are hard to break. Their strength is evident in the hardness of diamonds1,2 and tensile strength of polymeric fibres3,4,5,6; on the single-molecule level, it manifests itself in the need for forces of several nanonewtons to extend and mechanically rupture one bond. Such forces have been generated using extensional flow7,8,9, ultrasonic irradiation10, receding meniscus11 and by directly stretching a single molecule with nanoprobes12,13,14,15,16. Here we show that simple adsorption of brush-like macromolecules with long side chains on a substrate can induce not only conformational deformations17, but also spontaneous rupture of covalent bonds in the macromolecular backbone. We attribute this behaviour to the fact that the attractive interaction between the side chains and the substrate is maximized by the spreading of the side chains, which in turn induces tension along the polymer backbone. Provided the side-chain densities and substrate interaction are sufficiently high, the tension generated will be strong enough to rupture covalent carbon–carbon bonds. We expect similar adsorption-induced backbone scission to occur for all macromolecules with highly branched architectures, such as brushes and dendrimers. This behaviour needs to be considered when designing surface-targeted macromolecules of this type—either to avoid undesired degradation, or to ensure rupture at predetermined macromolecular sites."
https://openalex.org/W2032499946,"Mutations in ClC-7, a late endosomal/lysosomal member of the CLC family of chloride channels and transporters, cause osteopetrosis and lysosomal storage disease in humans and mice. Severe osteopetrosis is also observed with mutations in the OSTM1 gene, which encodes a membrane protein of unknown function. Here we show that both ClC-7 and Ostm1 proteins co-localize in late endosomes and lysosomes of various tissues, as well as in the ruffled border of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Co-immunoprecipitations show that ClC-7 and Ostm1 form a molecular complex and suggest that Ostm1 is a beta-subunit of ClC-7. ClC-7 is required for Ostm1 to reach lysosomes, where the highly glycosylated Ostm1 luminal domain is cleaved. Protein but not RNA levels of ClC-7 are greatly reduced in grey-lethal mice, which lack Ostm1, suggesting that the ClC-7-Ostm1 interaction is important for protein stability. As ClC-7 protein levels in Ostm1-deficient tissues and cells, including osteoclasts, are decreased below 10% of normal levels, Ostm1 mutations probably cause osteopetrosis by impairing the acidification of the osteoclast resorption lacuna, which depends on ClC-7 (ref. 3). The finding that grey-lethal mice, just like ClC-7-deficient mice, show lysosomal storage and neurodegeneration in addition to osteopetrosis implies a more general importance for ClC-7-Ostm1 complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1590054290,"The γ-ray burst GRB 050904, detected by the Swift satellite on 4 September last year, is one of the most distant objects ever observed. Its redshift of z = 6.3 equates to an explosion taking place 12.8 billion years ago, when the Universe was a mere 890 million years old. Three groups this week present detailed observations of the γ-ray, X-ray, near-infrared and optical spectra of the afterglow of GRB 050904. The results begin to paint a picture of the conditions prevailing when the parent body exploded and suggest that the γ-ray bursts that we see in the future can be used by cosmologists to probe the early Universe for evidence of star and galaxy formation, nucleosynthesis and reionization. The prompt γ-ray emission from γ-ray bursts (GRBs) should be detectable out to distances of z > 10 (ref. 1), and should therefore provide an excellent probe of the evolution of cosmic star formation, reionization of the intergalactic medium, and the metal enrichment history of the Universe1,2,3,4. Hitherto, the highest measured redshift for a GRB has been z = 4.50 (ref. 5). Here we report the optical spectrum of the afterglow of GRB 050904 obtained 3.4 days after the burst; the spectrum shows a clear continuum at the long-wavelength end of the spectrum with a sharp cut-off at around 9,000 Å due to Lyman α absorption at z ≈ 6.3 (with a damping wing). A system of absorption lines of heavy elements at z = 6.295 ± 0.002 was also detected, yielding the precise measurement of the redshift. The Si ii fine-structure lines suggest a dense, metal-enriched environment around the progenitor of the GRB."
https://openalex.org/W2026948106,"Beneath the eastern Mediterranean Sea lies one of the most extreme environments on Earth capable of sustaining life. Here the seawater floats on a lake of anoxic hypersaline brine known as the Bannock basin, and a new survey has revealed a remarkable microbial community thriving at a depth of 3.3 km. Dominated by Bacteria, rather than the Archaea that often predominate in extreme conditions, this newly discovered community occupies an ecological niche defined by a layer of water less than 3 metres in height between the anoxic brine and the overlying oxygen-containing deep seawater. Within this layer, bacterial types specialized to operate in a narrow band of salinity and oxygen concentration live in a layered microbial oasis, benefitting from methane from the brine below and organic particulates from the water column above. The chemical composition of the Bannock basin has been studied in some detail1,2. We recently showed that unusual microbial populations, including a new division of Archaea (MSBL1)3, inhabit the NaCl-rich hypersaline brine. High salinities tend to reduce biodiversity4, but when brines come into contact with fresher water the natural haloclines formed frequently contain gradients of other chemicals, including permutations of electron donors and acceptors, that may enhance microbial diversity, activity and biogeochemical cycling5,6. Here we report a 2.5-m-thick chemocline with a steep NaCl gradient at 3.3 km within the water column betweeen Bannock anoxic hypersaline brine7 and overlying sea water. The chemocline supports some of the most biomass-rich and active microbial communities in the deep sea, dominated by Bacteria rather than Archaea, and including four major new divisions of Bacteria. Significantly higher metabolic activities were measured in the chemocline than in the overlying sea water and underlying brine; functional analyses indicate that a range of biological processes is likely to occur in the chemocline. Many prokaryotic taxa, including the phylogenetically new groups, were confined to defined salinities, and collectively formed a diverse, sharply stratified, deep-sea ecosystem with sufficient biomass to potentially contribute to organic geological deposits."
https://openalex.org/W2031739749,"One of the earliest tests of Darwin's theory of natural selection was defensive mimicry, and this act of deception continues to cast light into hidden corners of evolutionary biology. Few frogs catch the eye like poison frogs — and such is their intent. Their garish colours advertise toxicity, and ‘cheating’ species mimic the warning coloration without the toxins to back it up. A study in the Amazonian rainforest in Ecuador has produced the surprising finding that edible frogs mimic the less toxic of two poison-frogs in the vicinity. Why mimic the less potent deterrent? The answer, discovered through learning experiments, lies in avoidance psychology. Extreme noxiousness makes predators avoid things that only slightly resemble the noxious object; however, with less severity, predator avoidance becomes specific. So the mimics of the less toxic poison frog gain total protection; they are avoided by predators learning on either the more or less toxic frogs. Batesian mimicry—resemblance of a toxic model by an edible mimic—depends on deceiving predators1. Mimetic advantage is considered to be dependent on frequency because an increase in mimic abundance leads to breakdown of the warning signal2,3. Where multiple toxic species are available, batesian polymorphism4 is predicted—that is, mimics diversify to match sympatric models. Despite the prevalence of batesian mimicry in nature5, batesian polymorphism is relatively rare6. Here we explore a poison-frog mimicry complex comprising two parapatric models and a geographically dimorphic mimic that shows monomorphism where models co-occur. Contrary to classical predictions, our toxicity assays, field observations and spectral reflectances show that mimics resemble the less-toxic and less-abundant model. We examine “stimulus generalization”7 as a mechanism for this non-intuitive result with learning experiments using naive avian predators and live poison frogs. We find that predators differ in avoidance generalization depending on toxicity of the model, conferring greater protection to mimics resembling the less-toxic model owing to overlap of generalized avoidance curves. Our work supports a mechanism of toxicity-dependent stimulus generalization8, revealing an additional solution for batesian mimicry where multiple models coexist."
https://openalex.org/W2038616578,"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group E gene product, damaged DNA-binding protein 2 (DDB2), is a subunit of the DDB heterodimeric protein complex with high specificity for binding to a variety of DNA helix-distorting lesions. DDB is believed to play a role in the initial step of damage recognition in mammalian nucleotide excision repair (NER) of ultraviolet light (UV)-induced photolesions. It has been shown that DDB2 is rapidly degraded after cellular UV irradiation. However, the relevance of DDB2 degradation to its functionality in NER is still unknown. Here, we have provided evidence that Cullin 4A (CUL-4A), a key component of CUL-4A-based ubiquitin ligase, mediates DDB2 degradation at the damage sites and regulates the recruitment of XPC and the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. We have shown that CUL-4A can be identified in a UV-responsive protein complex containing both DDB subunits. CUL-4A was visualized in localized UV-irradiated sites together with DDB2 and XPC. Degradation of DDB2 could be blocked by silencing CUL-4A using small interference RNA or by treating cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132. This blockage resulted in prolonged retention of DDB2 at the subnuclear DNA damage foci within micropore irradiated cells. Knock down of CUL-4A also decreased recruitment of the damage recognition factor, XPC, to the damaged foci and concomitantly reduced the removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from the entire genome. These results suggest that CUL-4A mediates the proteolytic degradation of DDB2 and that this degradation event, initiated at the lesion sites, regulates damage recognition by XPC during the early steps of NER.

The genome of all living organisms is constantly subjected to damage by many kinds of physical and chemical agents. Prompt repair of DNA damage enables cells to overcome genotoxicity and retain normal cellular functions. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) 3The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; 6-4PP, (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers; CUL-4A, cullin 4A; DDB, damaged DNA-binding protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GGR, global genomic repair; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffer saline; siRNA, small interference RNA; TCR, transcription-coupled repair; Ub, ubiquitin; XP, Xeroderma pigmentosum. is a versatile DNA repair pathway that eliminates a wide variety of helix-distorting DNA lesions, including UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PP). Mammalian NER consists of two distinct subpathways: global genomic repair (GGR), which operates throughout the genome, and transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which works on damage within transcribed DNA strands of transcriptionally active genes (1De Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 2Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 221: 47-70PubMed Google Scholar). Loss or impairment of NER is associated with several rare autosomal recessive genetic disorders, e.g. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (3Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar). XP syndrome is characterized by hypersensitivity to sunlight and a predisposition to skin cancer. Seven XP complementation groups have been identified, and all of the corresponding genes, from XPA to XPG, have been cloned (4Bootsma D. Weeda G. Vermeulen W. Van Vuuren H. Troelstra C. Van der Spek P. Hoeijmakers J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Biol. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 347: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutation in XPC results in the loss of GGR but not TCR, suggesting that the XPC gene encodes a damage recognition factor involved in GGR (5Venema J. Van Hoffen A. Karcagi V. Natarajan A.T. Van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The XPC protein binds in vivo to hHR23B, which is one of the two mammalian homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad23 protein (6Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T.

Iwai S. Hanaoka F. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and it is one of the six core factors (Replication protein A, XPA, XPC-hHR23B, XPG, ERCC1-XPF, Transcription factor II H) essential for damage recognition and dual incision in vitro (9Petit C. Sancar A. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).

XP-E cells lack the damaged DNA binding activity of the damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB), which is composed of the DDB1 (or p127) and the DDB2 (or p48) subunits (14Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J.

Despite its capability of binding to damaged DNA, DDB is not required for cell-free NER reconstituted in vitro (25Araujo S.J. Tirode F. Coin F. Pospiech H. Syvaoja J.E. Stucki M. Hubscher U.

Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopic expression of human DDB2 in Chinese hamster cells enhances the removal of CPD from the genome and suppresses UV-induced mutagenesis (29Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that DDB plays an important role in the recognition of CPD in vivo. DDB2, like XPC, accumulates at DNA damage sites immediately after UV irradiation (30Wang Q.E. Zhu Q. Wani G. Chen J. Wani A.A.

Recent evidence further indicates that DDB activates the recruitment of XPC to CPD in vivo (32Fitch M.E. Nakajima S. Yasui A. Ford J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46906-46910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Besides acting on CPD, DDB mediates efficient targeting of XPC to 6-4PP and accelerates its repair (33Moser J. Volker M. Kool H. Alekseev S. Vrieling H. Yasui A. Van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, DDB can be considered as the initial damage recognition factor for UV-induced photolesions. Although the precise role of DDB in NER remains unclear, it has been known that DDB2 is regulated at the transcriptional level by tumor suppressor p53 (13Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G.

The target proteins are labeled by covalent attachment of multiple moieties of Ub, a highly conserved 76-residue eukaryotic protein. The poly(Ub)-conjugated substrates are recognized and destroyed by the proteasome. The attachment of Ub to a protein substrate is preceded by a cascade reaction of three enzymes, namely, the E1 Ub-activating enzyme, the E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme, and the E3 Ub-protein ligase. Cullin 4A (CUL-4A)-based Ub ligase appears to be responsible for UV-induced DDB2 degradation. CUL-4A belongs to a cullin family of proteins that assemble into multiple E3 ligase complexes (39Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 40Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (Reviews): 3002Crossref Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that CUL-4A associates with DDB1 and overexpression of CUL-4A increases the ubiquitylation and the decay rate of DDB2 (35Nag A. Bondar T. Shiv S. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6738-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 42Shiyanov P. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35309-35312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The DDB-CUL-4A complex can directly ubiquitylate DDB2 in vitro (37Matsuda N. Azuma K. Saijo M. Iemura S. Hioki Y. Natsume T. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Tanaka K. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results, together with immediate recruitment of DDB2 to DNA damage and rapid turnover of DDB2 after UV irradiation (19Rapic-Otrin V. McLenigan M.P. Bisi D.C. Gonzalez M. Levine A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2588-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 36Fitch M.E. Cross I.V. Turner S.J. Adimoolam S. Lin C.X. Williams K.G. Ford J.M. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggest that the fate of DDB2 engaged in damage recognition is tightly controlled by Ub-mediated proteolysis. Here, we have addressed the functionality (e.g. damage recognition and repair of UV-induced lesions) of DDB2 ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation mediated by CUL-4A-based E3 ligase. We present evidence that CUL-4A is an essential component for Ub-mediated proteolysis of DDB2 and is being physically recruited to DNA damage sites in chromatin. Degradation of DDB2 regulates the recruitment of XPC to DNA damage and subsequently the repair of UV-induced CPD. Our results support the idea that DDB2 degradation is integral to DNA damage handover from DDB to XPC during the initial steps of NER. Cell Lines—The normal human fibroblasts (OSU-2) were established in culture in our laboratory as described by Venkatachalam et al. (43Venkatachalam S. Denissenko M. Wani A.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably expressing N-terminal FLAG-HA epitope-tagged DDB2 (HeLa-DDB2) were kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihiro Nakatani (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). HeLa-DDB2 cells stably expressing c-Myc epitope-tagged CUL-4A (HeLa-DCH) and V5-His epitope-tagged XPC (HeLa-XPC) were established in our laboratory. For expression of CUL-4A in HeLa-DDB2 cells, the Myc3-tagged CUL-4A expression construct (a gift from Dr. Yue Xiong, University of North Carolina) was introduced into the HeLa-DDB2 cells and the transfectants were selected with G418. For expression of V5-His-tagged XPC, the XPC cDNA were inserted into pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen). The expression constructs were transfected into the Hela-DDB2 cells, and the stable transfectants were established through subcloning of the transfected cells. In both cases, the stably transfected cells were further subcloned by a single cell dilution and identified by Western blot analysis. The DNA transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and 500 μg/ml of G418 (for selection and maintenance of the transgenic cell lines) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For experiments to assess DNA damage and repair, the monolayer cells were grown to confluence and then incubated with serum-free medium for 24 h. UV Irradiation—The cells ready for UV-C irradiation were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The UV-C light of 254 nm was delivered from a germicidal lamp at a dose rate of 0.5 J/m2/s as measured by a Kettering model 65 radiometer (Cole-Palmer Instrument Co., Vernon Hills, IL). For local UV irradiation, the cells were grown for 24-48 h to ∼70% confluence on glass coverslips. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with PBS. Prior to UV irradiation, an isopore polycarbonate filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a pore size of 3, 5, or 8 μm diameter, was placed on top of the cell monolayer. The filter-covered coverslips were irradiated with the desired UV doses. The filter was then gently removed, and the cells were processed immediately or maintained in a suitable medium for the desired period and processed thereafter. Immunoprecipitation of the DDB2 Complex and Western Blotting— The HeLa-DCH cells grown to confluence were UV irradiated at 25 J/m2 and incubated for the indicated periods in fresh medium. The cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (final concentration in PBS) at room temperature for 10 min, followed by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm and incubation for 5 min to quench the cross-linking. After two additional washes with cold PBS, the cells were scraped from dishes and collected in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, 10 μg/ml of pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell extracts were made by sonication of the cell lysates on ice to break the DNA to a 100-500-bp fragment. The DDB2 complex in cell extracts was purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) followed by recovery with anti-FLAG gel (Sigma). Briefly, the cell extracts containing ∼2 mg of protein were incubated with 25 μl of anti-HA affinity matrix in radioimmune precipitation buffer at 4 °C overnight. The matrix beads were washed, and the bound proteins were eluted three times each with 25 μl of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mg/ml of HA peptide at room temperature for 10 min. The eluted proteins were pooled and diluted in radioimmune precipitation buffer and further immunoprecipitated with 25 μl of anti-FLAG gel. The bound proteins were recovered by dissolving the immunoprecipitates in IP elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). To reverse cross-link, the complex was incubated at 65 °C for 5 h after adding 0.2 m NaCl to the eluents. For Western blotting, the cell extracts were made from either transfected or non-transfected cells by boiling the cell lysates for 10 min in a sample buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture in 62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The proteins were quantified and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the immunoblot analysis was performed as described earlier (43Venkatachalam S. Denissenko M. Wani A.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For detecting DDB2 complex, Novex® Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) were used for separating proteins under reduced or non-reduced conditions. Quantitation of CPD and 6-4PP Photolesions—OSU-2 cells, either siRNA transfected or mock transfected or untransfected, were maintained in fresh serum-free medium for 12 h before exposure to 20 J/m2 dose of UV irradiation. At the indicated post-UV time, the cells were recovered for isolating genomic DNA. The initial formation of CPD and 6-4PP and that remaining in DNA after cellular repair for varying times were quantitated using a non-competitive immuno-slot blot assay as described earlier (44Wani A.A. D'Ambrosio S.M. Alvi N.K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 46: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The damage levels were calculated by comparing the band intensities of the samples with UV-irradiated DNA standards run in parallel with all the blots. The total amount of DNA loaded on the nitrocellulose membrane was kept constant for each sample blotted. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence staining of the cells was conducted essentially according to the method established in our laboratory (45Wang Q. Zhu Q. Wani M.A. Wani G. Chen J. Wani A.A. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 483-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cells were grown on coverslips in 60-mm dishes, washed twice with cold PBS, UV irradiated, and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by three washes with PBS. For DNA denaturation, the cells were incubated in 2 N HCl for 5 min at 37°C. The coverslips were rinsed three time with PBS and blocked with 20% normal goat serum in washing buffer (0.1% Triton X-100/PBS) at room temperature for 30 min. Primary rabbit anti-XPC, anti-CPD, mouse monoclonal anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies as well as fluorescent (FITC or Texas Red)-conjugated secondary antibodies were all prepared in washing buffer containing 1.5% normal goat serum and layered on the coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. Following each antibody incubation step, the cells were washed with 0.1% Tween 20/PBS four times for 5 min each. After fluorescent staining, the coverslips were mounted in VectaShield antifade containing medium with 0.75 mg/ml of 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as a DNA counterstain. Fluorescence images were obtained with a Nikon Fluorescence Microscope E80i (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with appropriate filters for FITC, Texas Red, and DAPI. The digital images were then captured through automatic time exposures with a cooled CCD camera and processed with SPOT analysis software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Antibodies—Rabbit anti-DDB2 antibody (DDB2-A) and anti-XPC antibody (XPC-2) were generated by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptides and were affinity purified with the corresponding peptide (BioSource, Hopkinton, MA). Peptide KRPETQKTSEIVLRPRNKR matches to the N terminus of human DDB2 protein, whereas KTKREKKAAASHLFPFEKL matches to the C terminus of human XPC protein. Polyclonal anti-CUL-4A was a gift from Dr. Yue Xiong (University of North Carolina). Polyclonal anti-CPD was raised and characterized in our laboratory as previously described (44Wani A.A. D'Ambrosio S.M. Alvi N.K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 46: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-CPD and anti-6-4PP antibodies were generously provided by Dr. Tsukasa Matsunaga (Kanazawa University, Japan). Monoclonal antibodies recognizing c-Myc, FLAG, or HA epitopes were purchased from Sigma or Roche Diagnostics, respectively. Antibodies against Actin and XPB were from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Fluorescent-conjugated antibodies Alex Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG2a and IgG1 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); Texas Red goat anti-rabbit IgG and FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RNA Interference—siRNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) in a purified and annealed duplex form. The sequences targeting human CUL-4A gene are 5′-GAACAGCGAUCGUAAUCAAUU-3 (sense) and 5′-pUUGAUUACGAUCGCUGUUCUU-3′ (antisense). This set was chosen from four candidate siRNA through pilot experiments. siRNA transfection experiments were carried out using Lipofectamine transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the Lipofectamine 2000 and OPTI-MEM medium (Invitrogen) were mixed for 5 min and then incubated with siRNA for 20 min at room temperature. After addition of the proper amount of 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to the mixture, the siRNA-Lipofectamine mix was applied to the cell cultures. 48 h following siRNA transfection, the cells were used to analyze the expression of CUL-4A, DDB2, and other proteins. For DNA repair experiments, the transfected cells were maintained for 12 h in fresh serum-free medium after siRNA treatment. For immunofluorescent staining experiments, the siRNA transfection was performed with the cells grown on coverslips in 60-mm dishes. CUL-4A Is an Essential Component for UV-induced DDB2 Degradation in Vivo—It has been reported that the DDB2 protein undergoes a Ub-mediated proteolysis shortly after cellular UV irradiation (19Rapic-Otrin V. McLenigan M.P. Bisi D.C. Gonzalez M. Levine A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2588-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 36Fitch M.E. Cross I.V. Turner S.J. Adimoolam S. Lin C.X. Williams K.G. Ford J.M. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that DDB2 degradation is enhanced by overexpression of CUL-4A (35Nag A. Bondar T. Shiv S. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6738-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We tested whether CUL-4A is an essential component for UV-induced degradation of DDB2 in vivo using RNA interference-based targeting technology. As shown in Fig. 1A, HeLa-DDB2, stably expressing FLAG-HA-tagged DDB2, produced DDB2 at significant levels in the absence of UV irradiation (lanes 1 and 2). However, upon UV irradiation these cells exhibited a sharp decrease in the DDB2 levels within 2-8 h of exposure (lanes 3, 5, and 7). Moreover, the levels of XPB, a component of transcription factor II H, were unaffected by UV irradiation at all post-irradiation times. Although both of these factors, DDB2 and XPB, are involved in NER, these data indicated that UV-induced loss of DDB2 protein is highly specific and presumably related to its function in initiating NER. Treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 showed a clear inhibition of the UV-induced loss of DDB2 in HeLa-DDB2 cells (lanes 4, 6, and 8), suggesting the involvement of the Ub-proteasome system in this process. Controls, mock transfected with nonspecific siRNA, showed prompt degradation of DDB2 as early as 0.5 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 1B). The lowest level of DDB2 was seen at 4 h, and it started to recover at 8 h following irradiation. In contrast, no obvious loss of DDB2 could be seen after UV irradiation in cells that were transfected with CUL-4A siRNA. Western blot analysis showed that CUL-4A siRNA was specific and effective in diminishing the targeted CUL-4A protein at all the experimental time points used for assessing the fate of repair factors (Fig. 1C). Thus, silencing CUL-4A in cells prevented UV-induced DDB2 degradation, which is in agreement with the potential role of Cul-4A in DDB2 clearance. CUL-4A Complexes with DDB and Is Recruited to DNA Damage Sites—Recent studies have identified a DDB-CUL-4A complex that possesses E3 Ub ligase activity (47Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R. Kisselev A.F. Tanaka K. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis with purified DDB-CUL-4A complex also showed that the complex can directly ubiquitylate DDB2 in vitro (37Matsuda N. Azuma K. Saijo M. Iemura S. Hioki Y. Natsume T. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Tanaka K. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that by virtue of the DNA binding prowess of one of its associated components, CUL-4A would be physically recruited to DNA damage sites as a multimeric DDB-CUL-4A complex. This complex would therefore respond to cellular UV irradiation like its physically associated component and the in vivo substrate, DDB2. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the DNA damage response of the complex after in vivo UV irradiation of cells. The DDB-CUL-4A complex was purified, from HeLa-DCH cells that express both HA-FLAG-tagged DDB2 and Myc3-tagged-CUL-4A, by two immunoprecipitation steps using anti-HA and anti-FLAG affinity matrices. For direct examination of the complex components, cellular proteins were cross-linked by formaldehyde treatment of cells before and at varying times after UV irradiation. A complex with a molecular mass larger than 220 kDa was detectable in Western blots using anti-HA (DDB2) antibody (Fig. 2A). The same complex was also seen using anti-DDB1 as well as anti-Myc (CUL-4A) antibodies. The presence of Cul-4A in the complex was confirmed by direct binding of antibodies specific for native CUL-4A protein (data not shown). Interestingly, the strongest signal of the complex components was seen in the samples from unirradiated cells, and this was the case irrespective of which component-specific antibodies were used for detection. This high level of protein signal persisted at"

Both the bursts themselves and their afterglows have been predicted to be visible out to redshifts of z approximately 20, and therefore to be powerful probes of the early Universe. The burst GRB 000131, at z = 4.50, was hitherto the most distant such event identified. Here we report the discovery of the bright near-infrared afterglow of GRB 050904 (ref. 4). From our measurements of the near-infrared afterglow, and our failure to detect the optical afterglow, we determine the photometric redshift of the burst to be z = 6.39 - 0.12 + 0.11 (refs 5-7). Subsequently, it was measured spectroscopically to be z = 6.29 +/- 0.01, in agreement with our photometric estimate. These results demonstrate that GRBs can be used to trace the star formation, metallicity, and reionization histories of the early Universe."

Despite its potential physiological importance, NAPE-PLD has not yet been characterized with a purified enzyme preparation. In the present study we expressed a recombinant NAPE-PLD in Escherichia coli and highly purified it. The purified enzyme was remarkably activated in a dose-dependent manner by millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ as well as Ca2+ and, hence, appeared to be constitutively active. The enzyme showed extremely high specificity for NAPEs among various glycerophospholipids but did not reveal obvious selectivity for different long chain or medium chain N-acyl species of NAPEs. These results suggested the ability of NAPE-PLD to degrade different NAPEs without damaging other membrane phospholipids. Metal analysis revealed the presence of catalytically important zinc in NAPE-PLD. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis studies were addressed to several histidine and aspartic acid residues of NAPE-PLD that are highly conserved within the metallo-β-lactamase family. Single mutations of Asp-147, His-185, His-187, Asp-189, His-190, His-253, Asp-284, and His-321 caused abolishment or remarkable reduction of the catalytic activity. Moreover, when six cysteine residues were individually mutated to serine, only C224S showed a considerably reduced activity. The activities of L207F and H380R found as single nucleotide polymorphisms were also low.

The deduced primary structure of NAPE-PLD showed no homology with those of other known PLDs but revealed that the enzyme belongs to the metallo-β-lactamase family. The recombinant NAPE-PLD expressed in COS-7 cells produced long chain NAEs including anandamide from their corresponding NAPEs. However, the enzyme did not hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine (PC) or PE and lacked the ability to catalyze transphosphatidylation. We also observed that stable expression of NAPE-PLD in mammalian cells caused a decrease in the endogenous levels of NAPEs and a concomitant increase in those of NAEs without showing obvious selectivity for N-acyl species (20Okamoto Y.

These results substantially agreed with earlier findings with crude preparations (21Schmid P.C. Reddy P.V. Natarajan V. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol.

The activity, mRNA, and protein of NAPE-PLD were detected in various mouse organs such as brain, testis, and kidney (18Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and all the brain regions of rat (28Morishita J. Okamoto Y. Tsuboi K. Ueno M. Sakamoto H. Maekawa N. Ueda N. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that the enzyme plays the central role in the formation of anandamide and other NAEs in animal tissues. To elucidate physiological and pathophysiological significance of an enzyme, catalytic properties of the purified enzyme must be clarified in detail. However, NAPE-PLD has not yet been characterized with the purified enzyme preparation. The first purpose of the present study is, therefore, to fully analyze the activation mechanism and substrate specificity of NAPE-PLD with a highly purified recombinant enzyme. In addition, although NAPE-PLD was classified into the metallo-β-lactamase family based on its primary structure, it remained unclear whether or not NAPE-PLD functions through a catalytic mechanism similar to those of the well characterized members of this family. Thus, we attempted to identify catalytically important amino acid residues of NAPE-PLD. For this second purpose, we extensively performed site-directed mutagenesis of the enzyme for the first time.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Rat NAPE-PLD in E. coli—The full-length rat NAPE-PLD cDNA with SalI and NotI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends was generated by PCR from rat NAPE-PLD-pcDNA3.1(+) using the forward primer, 5′-GTCGACATGGATGAAAATGAGAACAGCCAG-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-GCGGCCGCTCATGTTTCCTCAAAGGCTTTGTC-3′ and ligated into pGEX6P-1 with the aid of SalI and NotI. pGEX6P-1 enables the product to be expressed as a GST fusion protein with a PreScission protease cleavage site that allows removal of the GST tag. The construct NAPE-PLD-pGEX6P-1 was confirmed by sequencing in both directions. E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with this plasmid together with the chaperone plasmid pGro7. Cultures of a positive clone were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.7, allowed to grow at 22 °C for 16 h, and pelleted at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After freezing and thawing, the cells were resuspended in 15 of the original culture volume of 100 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF and lysed by sonication on ice 10 times each for 20 s with an interval of 1 min. The lysate was solubilized with 1% CHAPS, and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was diluted 3-fold in 100 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1% CHAPS, 10 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF (buffer A). Because the co-expressed GroEL (a gene product of pGro7) formed a complex with the NAPE-PLD-GST fusion protein, denatured proteins from bacterial lysate, which can bind to GroEL, were also added as described previously (33Rohman M. Harrison-Lavoie K.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 45-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) except that the denatured proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and to the resultant supernatant derived from 100 ml of the original culture, 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads pre-equilibrated with buffer A was added. The mixture was then incubated at 4 °C overnight with gently mixing to allow the GST-NAPE-PLD fusion protein to bind to the beads. The beads were then packed into a column and washed twice with 10 ml of buffer A and once with 10 ml of buffer A in which the ATP concentration was reduced to 5 mm. The fusion protein was eluted from the column with 6 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm glutathione, 1% CHAPS, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF. After removal of glutathione by extensive dialysis, the fusion protein was subjected to digestion with PreScission protease at 4 °C for 10 h to release the GST tag. The sample was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (bed volume, 2 ml) again to remove the cleaved GST tag, and the GST-free NAPE-PLD, which passed through the column, was collected. The above-mentioned purification procedure was performed six times, and the purified enzyme was pooled and finally applied onto a Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite column (1 ml). After washing the column with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF (buffer B) and then with 15 ml of buffer B containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, the enzyme was eluted with 6 ml of buffer B containing 200 mm potassium phosphate. All the purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. The purified enzyme was stored in the presence of 1% octyl glucoside at –80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Mutagenesis—Single mutations were introduced into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) harboring rat or human NAPE-PLD by PCR with the aid of a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. A series of deletion mutants was constructed by PCR using mouse NAPE-PLD cDNA as a template, and the PCR products were inserted into pcDNA3.1(–)-HisA using EcoRV and BamHI sites of the multi-cloning sites. The oligonucleotides used as PCR primers are listed in Table 1. All the constructs were subsequently sequenced to check the introduction of the desired mutations.TABLE 1PCR primers utilized to prepare mutants of NAPE-PLD proteinNamePrimary structure (N terminus-C terminus)PCR primersDeletion mutants of mouse NAPE-PLD with a c-Myc-His6 tag at the C terminusWild type1-396F: GATATCATGGATGAGTATGAGGACAGC (#1)R: GGATCCTGTTTCTTCAAAAGCTCTATCATC (#2)ΔN5556-396F: GATATCATGAAATCAAAGAAAGGAAAAGACR: #2ΔN8586-396F: GATATCATGGAGAAGAATCACAGCGGCR: #2ΔN138139-396F: GATATCATGGACGAGCTCATCTTCCTCR: #2367stop1-367F: #1R: GGATCCTCTCTCTAGAGCTTCATTCAG377stop1-377F: #1R: GGATCCTATGAAGAAATCCTCACAAGA387stop1-387F: #1R: GGATCCATTCAAGTATCTCGACTCTCCSingle mutants of rat NAPE-PLDD147N1-396F: CTCATCCTCCTCACGAATCCCATGTTCAGCR: GCTGAACATGGGATTCGTGAGGAGGATGAGH185N1-396F: GCTGTCCTCATTAGTAACAACCACTACGACR: GTCGTAGTGGTTGTTACTAATGAGGACAGCH187N1-396F: CTCATTAGTCACAACAACTACGACCACCTGR: CAGGTGGTCGTAGTTGTTGTGACTAATGAGD189N1-396F: AGTCACAACCACTACAACCACCTGGACTACR: GTAGTCCAGGTGGTTGTAGTGGTTGTGACTH190N1-396F: CACAACCACTACGACAACCTGGACTACGGCR: GCCGTAGTCCAGGTTGTCGTAGTGGTTGTGH253N1-396F: TTCACGCCCTCCCAAAATTGGTGTAAAAGGR: CCTTTTACACCAATTTTGGGAGGGCGTGAAD284N1-396F: TTCTTTTTCGCTGGGAATACTGGTTACTGR: CAGTAACCAGTATTCCCAGCGAAAAAGAAH321N1-396F: TTTATGAAATACCAAAATGCTGACCCAGAGR: CTCTGGGTCAGCATTTTGGTATTTCATAAAH331N1-396F: GATGCTGTAAGGATTAACATTGACGTTCAAR: TTGAACGTCAATGTTAATCCTTACAGCATCH343N1-396F: AGATCCGTGGCGATTAACTGGGGGACTTTTR: AAAAGTCCCCCAGTTAATCGCCACGGATCTH353N1-396F: GCCTTAGCTAATGAGAATTACTTAGAGCCGR: CGGCTCTAAGTAATTCTCATTAGCTAAGGCC170S1-396F: CGCCGTCCCCCGTCTACCATAAGCGAACR: GTTCGCTTATGGTAGACGGGGGACGGCGC222S1-396F: CTGGATGCAGAAGTCTGGCTGTGAGAACR: GTTCTCACAGCCAGACTTCTGCATCCAGC224S1-396F: CAGAAGTGTGGCTCTGAGAACGTGATTGR: CAATCACGTTCTCAGAGCCACACTTCTGC237S1-396F: GTGGGAGGAGAATTCCGTCCCTGGCCATGR: CATGGCCAGGGACGGAATTCTCCTCCCACC255S1-396F: CTCCCAACATTGGTCTAAAAGGACCCTCR: GAGGGTCCTTTTAGACCAATGTTGGGAGC288S1-396F: GATACTGGTTACTCCCCTGCTTTTGAAGR: CTTCAAAAGCAGGGGAGTAACCAGTATCL207F1-396F: GTTTGGCAGTGAGTTTAGGTGGTTCGTGCR: GCACGAACCACCTAAACTCACTGCCAAACH380R1-396F: TTCTTCATCCTGAAGAACGGAGAGTCACGAR: TCGTGACTCTCCGTTCTTCAGGATGAAGAASingle mutants of human NAPE-PLDS152A1-393F: GATCCCATCTTTAGCGCTCGTGCTTCACCAR: TGGTGAAGCACGAGCGCTAAAGATGGGATCL207F1-393F: ATTTGGTAATGAGTTCAGATGGTTTGTGCCTR: AGGCACAAACCATCTGAACTCATTACCAAATH380R1-393F: TTTGTCTTGAAGCGTGGAGAATCAAGAR: TCTTGATTCTCCACGCTTCAAGACAAAD389N1-393F: AGATACCTAAATAATAATGATGAAAACTTTTR: AAAAGTTTTCATCATTATTATTTAGGTATCT Open table in a new tab Expression of NAPE-PLD in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C to 70% confluency in a 100-mm dish containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. The cells were then treated with the plasmid harboring wild-type or mutated NAPE-PLD cDNA (8 μg) and Lipofectamine and cultured at 37 °C for 48 h with one change of medium at 12 h. The harvested cells were sonicated 3 times each for 3 s in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The resultant homogenates were centrifuged at 105,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the obtained pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% (w/v) octyl glucoside followed by further centrifugation at 105,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Thus, prepared clear supernatant (the solubilized NAPE-PLD) was subjected to enzyme assay and Western blotting. Enzyme Assay—NAPE-PLD was incubated with 25 μm14C-labeled substrates (2500 cpm/2.5 nmol) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.1% octyl glucoside at 37 °C for 10–120 min unless otherwise noted. S. chromofuscus PLD was incubated with 25 μm 14C-labeled substrates (2500 cpm/2.5 nmol) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 1% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 10–120 min. For radioactive substrates with 14C in the N-acyl group, the enzyme reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.3 ml of a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 5 mm 3(2)-t-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole. For those with 14C in the sn-2 acyl group, a mixture of chloroform, methanol, 36% HCl (2:1:0.01, v/v) containing 5 mm 3(2)-t -butyl-4-hydroxyanisole was added. As for sn-glycero-3-phospho(N-[14C]palmitoyl)ethanolamine, the reaction was terminated with a mixture of 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 5 mm 3(2)-t-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole followed by extraction with 0.2 ml of 2 m KCl containing 0.1 m EDTA according to the method of Folch et al. (35Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the termination of enzyme reaction, 100 μl of the organic phase was spotted on a silica gel thin-layer plate (10- or 20-cm height) and developed in chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (40:10:1, v/v) (for N-[14C]acyl-PEs, N-[14C]palmitoyllyso-PE, sn-glycero-3-phospho(N-[14C]palmitoyl)ethanolamine, and N-[14C]palmitoylethanolamine phosphate as substrates), in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (9:1:1, v/v) (for N-acyl-1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoylglycerophospholipids), or chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide, water (65:35:5:1, v/v) (for N-[14C]palmitoyl-PS) at 4 °C for 25 min (with a 10-cm height plate) or 90 min (with a 20-cm height plate). Distribution of radioactivity on the plate was quantified by a BAS1500 bioimaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). When PI was used as a substrate, the enzyme reaction was performed with 25 μm l-α-[myo-inositol-2-3H(N)]PI (25,000 cpm/2.5 nmol). After the reaction, 1 ml of chloroform, 0.5 ml of methanol, and 0.2 ml of water were added, and the produced [3H]inositol in a 400-μl aliquot of the upper phase was measured by liquid scintillation counting (36Okamoto Y. Vaena de Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46470-46477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All the enzyme assays were performed in triplicate. Km and Vmax were determined according to the method of Lineweaver and Burk (37Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (8022) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—After separation by SDS-PAGE with a 10% gel, proteins were electrotransferred to a hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P). The membrane was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (buffer C) and then incubated with anti-NAPE-PLD antiserum (1:200 dilution) or anti-hexahistidine antibody (1:10,000 dilution) in buffer C at room temperature for 1 h followed by incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) in buffer C at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, NAPE-PLD protein was visualized using ECL plus kit and analyzed by a LAS1000plus lumino-imaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). Atomic Absorption Spectrometry—Zinc content was determined by a Shimadzu atomic absorption/flame spectrometer model AA-630–01. Zinc standard solution was diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 40 mm potassium phosphate and 0.1% CHAPS in a range of 0–1.0 ppm to establish a standard calibration curve. Zinc values determined were based on comparison with the standard curve. Each of the purified NAPE-PLD preparations was analyzed in triplicate. Purification of Recombin"
https://openalex.org/W1975459549,"Much of modern condensed matter physics is understood in terms of elementary excitations, or quasiparticles--fundamental quanta of energy and momentum. Various strongly interacting atomic systems are successfully treated as a collection of quasiparticles with weak or no interactions. However, there are interesting limitations to this description: in some systems the very existence of quasiparticles cannot be taken for granted. Like unstable elementary particles, quasiparticles cannot survive beyond a threshold where certain decay channels become allowed by conservation laws; their spectrum terminates at this threshold. Such quasiparticle breakdown was first predicted for an exotic state of matter--super-fluid 4He at temperatures close to absolute zero, a quantum Bose liquid where zero-point atomic motion precludes crystallization. Here we show, using neutron scattering, that quasiparticle breakdown can also occur in a quantum magnet and, by implication, in other systems with Bose quasiparticles. We have measured spin excitations in a two-dimensional quantum magnet, piperazinium hexachlorodicuprate (PHCC), in which spin-1/2 copper ions form a non-magnetic quantum spin liquid, and find remarkable similarities with excitations in superfluid 4He. We observe a threshold momentum beyond which the quasiparticle peak merges with the two-quasiparticle continuum. It then acquires a finite energy width and becomes indistinguishable from a leading-edge singularity, so that excited states are no longer quasiparticles but occupy a wide band of energy. Our findings have important ramifications for understanding excitations with gapped spectra in many condensed matter systems, ranging from band insulators to high-transition-temperature superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2101521247,"Iron-sulfur clusters are prosthetic groups composed of sulfur and iron that are found in respiratory chain complexes and numerous enzymes. Iron-sulfur clusters are synthesized in a multistep process that utilizes cysteine desulfurases, scaffold proteins, chaperones, and iron donors. Assembly of iron-sulfur clusters occurs in the mitochondrial matrix of mammalian cells, but cytosolic isoforms of three major mammalian iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly components have been found, raising the possibility that de novo ironsulfur cluster biogenesis also occurs in cytosol. The human cysteine desulfurase, ISCS, has two isoforms, one of which targets to the mitochondria, whereas the other less abundant form is cytosolic and nuclear. The open-reading frame of cytosolic mammalian ISCS begins at the second AUG of the transcript and lacks mitochondrial targeting information. Yeast complementation experiments have suggested that the human cytosolic ISCS isoform (c-ISCS) cannot be functional. To evaluate function of c-ISCS, we overexpressed the human cytosolic ISCS in yeast Pichia pastoris and showed that the cytosolic form of ISCS is an active cysteine desulfurase that covalently binds 35S acquired from desulfuration of radiolabeled cysteine. Human cytosolic ISCS dimerized as efficiently as bacterial ISCS and formed a complex in vitro with overexpressed cytosolic human ISCU. When incubated with iron regulatory protein 1, cysteine, and iron, the cytosolic forms of ISCS and ISCU facilitated efficient formation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster on IRP1. Thus, the cytosolic form of ISCS is a functional cysteine desulfurase that can collaborate with cytosolic ISCU to promote de novo iron-sulfur cluster formation.

The human cysteine desulfurase, ISCS, has two isoforms, one of which targets to the mitochondria, whereas the other less abundant form is cytosolic and nuclear. The open-reading frame of cytosolic mammalian ISCS begins at the second AUG of the transcript and lacks mitochondrial targeting information. Yeast complementation experiments have suggested that the human cytosolic ISCS isoform (c-ISCS) cannot be functional. To evaluate function of c-ISCS, we overexpressed the human cytosolic ISCS in yeast Pichia pastoris and showed that the cytosolic form of ISCS is an active cysteine desulfurase that covalently binds 35S acquired from desulfuration of radiolabeled cysteine. Human cytosolic ISCS dimerized as efficiently as bacterial ISCS and formed a complex in vitro with overexpressed cytosolic human ISCU. When incubated with iron regulatory protein 1, cysteine, and iron, the cytosolic forms of ISCS and ISCU facilitated efficient formation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster on IRP1. Thus, the cytosolic form of ISCS is a functional cysteine desulfurase that can collaborate with cytosolic ISCU to promote de novo iron-sulfur cluster formation. Iron-sulfur clusters are prosthetic groups required for function of numerous enzymes and respiratory chain complexes. Enzymes involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis were first identified in bacteria, and homologues have since been found in plants, animals, and fungi (reviewed in Ref. 1Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). In the human genome, homologues of the cysteine desulfurase (2Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and NFU (4Tong W.H. Jameson G.N. Huynh B.H. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 2003; 48: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and other iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzymes are present. Interestingly, isoforms of ISCS, ISCU, and NFU are found in both mitochondria and cytosol, and ISCS and ISCU form a distinct complex in mammalian cytosol (3Tong W.H. Rouault T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that there is compartmentalization of Fe-S cluster biogenesis in mammalian cells. In contrast, mitochondria are believed to be the sole site of iron-sulfur cluster assembly in yeast (6Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single cysteine desulfurase with high homology to ISCS is encoded by Nfs1p. Nfs1p was initially detected only in mitochondria (7Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), but there is also a cytosolic/nuclear form of yeast NFS1 (8Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which is required for cell viability and for post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs in the nucleus and mitochondria (9Nakai Y. Umeda N. Suzuki T. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Watanabe K. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12363-12368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (10Muhlenhoff U. Balk J.

A single ISCS homologue identified in the human genome generates two distinct isoforms through alternative utilization of in-frame AUGs (2Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The major ISCS isoform (m-ISCS) generated by initiation at the first AUG of the ISCS transcript contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N terminus that undergoes cleavage to yield a mature mitochondrial protein of 47 kDa in size. A less abundant isoform generated by initiation of translation at the second in-frame AUG lacks the first 60 residues of the mitochondrial precursor form, and this 44-kDa cytosolic ISCS (c-ISCS) resides in both the cytosol and nucleus (2Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A highly conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr-60 of human m-ISCS, which is equivalent to Tyr-101 of S. cerevisiae Nfs1) is absent in c-ISCS. Recently, it was reported that the removal of 101 amino acids from the N terminus of yeast Nfs1 to approximate the N-terminal sequence of human cytosolic ISCS inactivated cysteine desulfurase activity in a yeast growth restoration assay, whereas removal of the only first 95 amino acids yielded a functional enzyme (see sequence alignments in Fig. 1). These results led to the proposal that Tyr-60 is essential for dimerization and enzymatic function of ISCS and were further interpreted as proof that human cytosolic ISCS (c-ISCS) could not be a functional enzyme (10Muhlenhoff U. Balk J. Richhardt N. Kaiser J.T. Sipos K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36906-36915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To directly assess whether the cytosolic form of ISCS can function, we overexpressed human c-ISCS in Pichia pastoris and assessed its cysteine desulfurase activity. We demonstrate that c-ISCS is a fully functional cysteine desulfurase that dimerizes as efficiently as the IscS of Azotobacter vinelandii, binds to human cytosolic ISCU (c-ISCU) in a complex, and facilitates assembly of an iron-sulfur cluster on iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1). 2The abbreviations used are: IRP1, iron regulatory protein 1; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; DTT, dithiothreitol; ISC, iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein. We found that the cytosolic form of ISCU was equally as efficient as the mature mitochondrial form of ISCU in facilitating reconstitution of the iron-sulfur cluster of IRP1. Thus, human c-ISCS and c-ISCU are fully functional, and their presence in cytosol is physiologically relevant. Constructs—ISCS and ISCU were overexpressed in Pichia under the control of the strong alcohol oxidase promoter (AOX1). For overexpression of c-ISCS in Pichia, PCR products were generated with primers P1 (5′-GAGGATCCACCATGGATGTGCAAGCTA-3′) and P2 (5′-CGGGAATTCTAGTGTTGGGTCCACTTG-3′) and the cDNA sequence of human ISCS derived from expressed sequence tag clones. The BamHI-EcoRI restriction enzyme-generated fragment of the iscS PCR product was cloned into the expression vector pPIC3.5K (Invitrogen) to generate pPIC-cIscS for overexpression in Pichia SMD1168 (Invitrogen). The construct pPIC-cIscS was also transformed into DS115(CA13–02) (11Allerson C.R. Martinez A. Yikilmaz E. Rouault T.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to generate DS115(c-ISCS+IRP1) for co-overexpression of c-ISCS and IRP1. For overexpression of c-ISCU in Pichia, PCR products were generated with primers P3 (5′-GGGGATCCATGGTTCTCATTGAC-3′) and P4 (5′-GCGCCTCGAGAGGGAGGGCTCATT-3′) and an expressed sequence tag clone EST73531 that contains the coding sequence of cytosolic ISCU (3Tong W.H. Rouault T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The BamHI-XhoI fragment of iscU PCR product was cloned into pET24a⊕ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate pET-cIscU for overexpression in E. coli BL21(DE3), or into pCA10.3 (11Allerson C.R. Martinez A. Yikilmaz E. Rouault T.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to generate pCA-cIscU for overexpression in Pichia SMD1168 (Invitrogen). For overexpression of m-ISCU in BL21(DE3), primers P5 (5′-GGGGCATATGGCATATCACAAGAAGGTTGTT-3′) and P6 (5′-GGGCTCGAGTTTCTTCTCTGCCTCTCCTTT-3′) were used to amplify a mature form of m-iscUby PCR. NdeI-XhoI PCR product was cloned into pET24a⊕ to get pET-mIscU. Overexpressed c-ISCU and m-ISCU in E. coli were C-terminal His-tagged and under the control of the lac transcriptional elements. To overexpress the mature form of m-ISCU we added a start code ATG, followed by GCA, which encodes the amino acid `A', followed by the sequence TAT, which encodes the 35th amino acid `Y', the first amino acid distal to the predicted cleavage site of the mitochondrial target sequence in the N terminus. The remainder of the sequence was as written for Hs m-ISCU in the alignment of Fig. 1B. Nucleotide sequences for all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Overexpression and Purification of Human Cytosolic and Mitochondrial ISCU, Cytosolic ISCS, and IRP1—For overexpression of c-ISCU and m-ISCU, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET-cIscU or pET-mIscU was cultured in 2-liter flasks containing 700 ml of Terrific medium (Research Products International Corp., Mt. prospect, IL) supplemented with kanamycin (50 mg/liter) in a shaker at 37 °C/250 rpm until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.8. Expression of c-iscUor m-iscU was induced by the addition of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After induction, bacteria were cultured for 3 h and harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were frozen at –70 °C until used. The frozen cells were thawed in a lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) and subsequently sonicated and centrifuged. The soluble c-ISCU or m-ISCU protein was purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid gel recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Notably, c-ISCS could not be overexpressed and purified from bacteria because it was sequestered in inclusion bodies. Details about the overexpression of IRP1 in P. pastoris under the control of the strong alcohol oxidase promoter (AOX1), as well as protein purification, were described previously (11Allerson C.R. Martinez A. Yikilmaz E. Rouault T.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the last step of the purification, an affinity column of IRE (iron regulatory element) binding was used to isolate the apo-IRP1. Human cytosolic ISCS and ISCU were overexpressed in P. pastoris following procedures similar to those used for IRP1 overexpression. For purification of c-ISCS, the harvested and lysed cells were centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 15 min. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to 15% saturation. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation and resuspended in 16 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm (NH4)2SO4, loaded onto a column of DEAE-Sephadex (5 ml) and equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH8.0). The flow-through was loaded onto a Heparin sulfate column, and protein was eluted from the column at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of buffer A and buffer B (50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl), and subsequently concentrated with an Amicon concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The purity of the recombinant proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE after each step of the purification. The protein concentration was determined with Bradford assay. Demonstration of in Vitro Complex Formation between c-ISCU and c-ISCS—Pichia cells expressing c-ISCS or c-ISCU were lysed in 2 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm benzamidine). After cells were broken with the one-shot cell disrupter (Cell Disruption System, St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada), the lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants containing overexpressed c-ISCS or c-ISCU were either mixed together or separately incubated on ice for 3 h. One milliliter of mixed or non-mixed lysate was loaded on a HiPrep™ 16/60 Sephacryl™ S-300 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with elution buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl). The column was eluted with 1.5 bed volumes of elution buffer. Successive 1-ml fractions were collected and applied to 12% SDS-PAGE gel for analysis of c-ISCU and c-ISCS distribution by Western blot. Because we could not observe the monomer or dimer size of c-ISCS from the yeast lysate containing overexpressed c-ISCS by using the size-exclusion column, we used the purified c-ISCS to run the size-exclusion column analysis. The condition is the same as described above for the lysate. For high molecular weight gel-filtration calibration, the standard proteins (Amersham Biosciences) were used, which include thymoglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and cytochrome C (12.3 kDa). Enzymatic Assays—ISCS desulfurase activity was determined using a sulfide detection assay described previously (12Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Miller T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16053-16067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The amount of c-ISCS in lysate was determined by comparison to a concentration curve of purified protein, background activity from yeast into which an empty plasmid was transformed was subtracted, and the specific activity was calculated in nanomoles of [S–2]/mg/min. Alternatively, ISCS desulfurase activity was demonstrated using a 35S transfer assay. Sulfur transfer reactions were carried out at 23 °C for 30 s in an assay containing 1.6 μm ISCS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 30 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 35S-labeled l-cysteine (0.19 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) to a final concentration of 15 μm and were terminated by centrifugation at 2000 × g through a size-exclusion column (Microspin G-50 column, Amersham Biosciences). The spin column eluant was mixed with sample loading buffer to give final concentrations of 1% glycerol, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.001% bromphenol blue. Samples were immediately analyzed by electrophoresis in BupH™ Tris-HEPES-SDS gel (Pierce), but in the absence of added reducing agent and no heating. 35S was visualized by a PhosphorImager (Typhoon 9200, Amersham Biosciences). Fe-S cluster assembly was monitored by assaying aconitase activity using an in-gel assay or two different spectrophotometric assays. The in-gel aconitase assay was performed as described previously (13Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Overall aconitase activity of cell lysate was assayed by a coupled assay in which MTT reduction was monitored by the increase of absorbance at 570 nm at 22 °C in an assay containing 2 mm cis-aconitic acid, 1 mm NADP+, 25 mm MgCI2, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1–2 units of isocitrate dehydrogenase, 1.2 mm MTT, 0.3 mm phenazine methosulfate, and extract in a total volume of 1.0 ml. After Fe-S cluster reconstitution with purified c-ISCS and c-ISCU and transfer of Fe-S cluster to apo-IRP1, aconitase activity was followed by monitoring NADP+ reduction in an assay containing cis-aconitate (2 mm), and 2 units of isocitrate dehydrogenase, 0.2 mm NADP+, and 0.6 mm MnCl2 in a volume of 400 μl. The kinetics of NADPH production was measured at 340 nm assuming an extinct coefficient of 6200 m–1cm–1. Aconitase activity was calculated in micromoles of [NADPH]/min. Based on this aconitase activity, converted IRP1 (nanomoles) was calculated by referring to the specific activity of beef liver IRP1 (3.4 units/nmol [4Fe-4S]) when the substrate cis-aconitate was used (14Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11730-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To calculate the percentage of apo-IRP1 that converts to holoprotein, stoichiometry of one [4Fe-4S] per monomer was assumed, and the amount of initial apo-IRP1 was set to 100%. Reconstitution of Fe-S Clusters in IRP1—Each 2-ml Fe-S cluster assembly mixture included a 25 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm KCl buffer (pH 7.4) that contained 50 μm c-ISCU, 5 μm c-ISCS, 2 mm l-cysteine, 0.2 mm ferric ammonium citrate, 5 mm DTT, 10 μm pyridoxal phosphate. For control experiments c-ISCU and/or c-ISCS were omitted from the assembly mixture. All assembly reactions were incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 3 h and then applied to a prepacked Mono Q™ 5/50 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH8.0) buffer. After loading, the sample was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer, which removes free l-cysteine. Proteins were then eluted sequentially using 200 mm followed by 400 mm NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH8.0) buffer. Free Fe3+. S2–, and polymeric iron sulfides remained bound to the column. The eluted fractions were then incubated for 30 min with 10 μl of 10 μm purified apo-IRP1. Aconitase activity was determined using either the in-gel assay as described previously (13Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or a spectrophotometric assay to evaluate conversion of apo-IRP1 to the [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 form. To characterize the activity of cytosolic isoforms of human c-ISCS and c-ISCU (previously hIscU1 in Ref. 3Tong W.H. Rouault T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), c-ISCS and c-ISCU were overexpressed in P. pastoris under the control of the AOX1 promoter for high level, methanol-inducible expression. The cytosolic isoforms of human ISCS and ISCU differ from the mitochondrial isoforms at the N terminus, as shown in Fig. 1, but mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of ISCS and ISCU are identical throughout the rest of the protein. Western blot analysis showed overexpression of human c-ISCU, c-ISCS, and/or IRP1 proteins in Pichia after induction with methanol (Fig. 2A). Purified c-ISCS was obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by DEAE-column purification and elution from a heparin sulfate column (Fig. 2B). Previously, protein complexes containing homologues of ISCS and ISCU have been observed in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells (3Tong W.H. Rouault T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Gerber J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 16Ramazzotti A. Vanmansart V. Foury F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 18Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), suggesting that specific physical interactions between these proteins may be crucial for in vivo Fe-S cluster biogenesis. To assess whether c-ISCS and c-ISCU can form a complex in vitro, we examined the elution profiles of c-ISCS and c-ISCU on a fast protein liquid chromatography size-exclusion column. Western blot analysis showed that c-ISCS or c-ISCU eluted in markedly different fractions due to their different molecular weights. However, when lysates containing c-ISCS and c-ISCU were mixed prior to fractionation, both proteins were detected in fractions 31–39 (Fig. 3), indicating that a protein complex of c-ISCS and c-ISCU formed in vitro. In contrast, purified c-ISCS migrated in a position consistent with the size of a monomer (44 kDa) in fraction 75, that also may form dimers (88 kDa) in fractions 67-71, but does not comigrate with c-ISCS in yeast lysate, implying that c-ISCS forms a large protein complex with Pichia proteins. Our results suggest that c-ISCS and c-ISCU are capable of forming a protein complex in vitro. To evaluate cysteine desulfurase activity of c-ISCS, enzymatic activity was measured using an assay based on ability of the enzyme to generate hydrogen sulfide (12Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Miller T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16053-16067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The sulfide was detected after converting it to methylene blue in an acidified solution of N,N-dimethylenediamine and FeCl3. The cysteine desulfurase activity markedly increased in lysates of yeast that overexpressed c-ISCS (Fig. 4A), compared with lysates from strains transformed with empty plasmid or IRP1. Purified protein and activity analysis of four separate experiments indicated a specific activity of 6.4 ± 0.4 nmol/mg/min. In comparison, analysis of purified A. vinelandii NifS (a generous gift of Dennis Dean) yielded a specific activity of 75 nmol/mg/min. The previously published specific activity for S. cerevisiae is 12 nmol/mg/min. Thus, the specific activity of c-ISCS is comparable to S. cerevisiae Nfs1 (10Muhlenhoff U. Balk J. Richhardt N. Kaiser J.T. Sipos K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36906-36915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and both are lower than the reported specific activity of NifS (19Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Dimerization of ISCS is thought to be important in its enzymatic function (10Muhlenhoff U. Balk J. Richhardt N. Kaiser J.T. Sipos K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36906-36915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20Cupp-Vickery J.R. Urbina H. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and we therefore separated purified ISCS on a non-reducing gel with or without addition of GSH to evaluate whether c-ISCS can dimerize. In the absence of reductant, both monomeric and dimeric forms of c-ISCS were detected by Coomassie staining (Fig. 4B). However, addition of GSH reduced but did not eliminate the upper band between the 64- and 98-kDa markers, consistent with the possibility that the upper band represents a dimer that is further stabilized by disulfide bond formation between monomers. In the first step of Fe-S cluster assembly, ISCS acquires sulfur by converting cysteine to alanine and binding sulfur in a persulfide. To evaluate the ability of ISCS to form the persulfide using cysteine as a substrate, a 35S transfer assay was performed. Both the monomeric and dimeric forms acquired 35S labeling from 35S-labeled cysteine (Fig. 4B), indicating that c-ISCS can function as a cysteine desulfurase. To further evaluate the efficiency of dimerization and cysteine persulfide formation, c-ISCS was compared with the IscS from A. vinelandii. Dimerization and radioactive cysteine persulfide formation of c-ISCS were observed to be at least as efficient as the A. vinelandii IscS (Fig. 4C). Three different types of Fe-S cluster biosynthetic systems have been discovered thus far, and all of them are mechanistically unified by the requirement for a cysteine desulfurase, such as IscS, and the need for a Fe-S cluster scaffold protein, such as IscU, in de novo iron-sulfur cluster assembly. To evaluate the potential of c-ISCS and c-ISCU to facilitate formation of iron-sulfur clusters, the ability of these enzymes to provide iron-sulfur clusters to aconitase was evaluated by an in-gel aconitase assay (13Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Control yeast cells transformed with empty plasmid exhibited endogenous m-aconitase activity, which was not significantly enhanced by overexpression of human cytosolic ISCS or ISCU (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, IRP1 showed some aconitase activity when it was overexpressed in the cytosol of P. pastoris (Fig. 5A), but although we estimate that overexpressed IRP1 was as least 100-fold more abundant than mitochondrial aconitase (Ref. 11Allerson C.R. Martinez A. Yikilmaz E. Rouault T.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and data not shown), the aconitase activities of endogenous mitochondrial aconitase and overexpressed IRP1 were approximately equal, indicating very inefficient conversion of overexpressed apo-IRP1 to its aconitase form in P. pastoris cytosol. We then asked if c-ISCS or c-ISCU could activate IRP1 aconitase activity, by adding lysates containing either c-ISCS or c-ISCU to lysates containing IRP1. Aconitase gel assays showed that addition of lysates containing c-ISCS or c-ISCU had only a minor effect on the aconitase activities of IRP1 or yeast m-aconitase, but simultaneous addition of c-ISCS and c-ISCU overexpression lysates led to a marked increase in IRP1 aconitase activity (Fig. 5B), suggesting that c-ISCS and c-ISCU cooperated to facilitate Fe-S cluster assembly in IRP1. Similarly, mitochondrial aconitase released from the mitochondria during lysate preparation also acquired Fe-S cluster in the presence of c-ISCS and c-ISCU and exhibited increased enzymatic activity (Fig. 5B). Because acquisition of the iron-sulfur clusters of both apo-IRP1 and mitochondrial aconitase was facilitated in vitro by the scaffold protein c-ISCU (Fig. 5B), we compared the efficiency of c-ISCU in iron-sulfur cluster reconstitution to the efficiency of overexpressed m-ISCU, which was designed to closely match the mature mitochondrial form of ISCU predicted to function after mitochondrial import, processing and cleavage (described under “Experimental Procedures”). The relative reconstitution efficiencies of c-ISCU and m-ISCU were evaluated by an in-gel assay at three different time points performed in duplicate (Fig. 5C). As indicated in Fig. 5C, cytosolic ISCU and mature mitochondrial ISCU were almost equally efficacious as scaffold proteins in Fe-S cluster assembly. To test whether c-ISCS and c-ISCU can assemble and transfer a Fe-S cluster to IRP1 in the absence of other factors present in yeast lysate, c-ISCS and c-ISCU were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and incubated with iron, DTT, and cysteine in an anaerobic chamber for 3 h to reconstitute the Fe-S cluster in c-ISCU. Control experiments were performed in the absence of one or both proteins. Each reaction mixture was then applied to a Mono™-Q column, and proteins were eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl. Apo-IRP1 was then added to each eluate fraction and the fractions were incubated for an additional 2 h in the anaerobic chamber. Aconitase activity of each eluate fraction was evaluated by the in-gel aconitase assay. The experimental scheme is outlined in Fig. 6A. No significant activation of IRP1 aconitase activity was observed when c-ISCS and c-ISCU were absent or only c-ISCU was absent, whereas a very small activation was observed when c-ISCU alone was present (Fig. 6B, top three panels). IRP1 aconitase activity was significantly reconstituted when both c-ISCS and c-ISCU were present in the initial reaction (Fig. 6B, fourth horizontal panel). The minimal activation of IRP1 aconitase in the c-ISCU-only panel indicates that c-ISCU might be a functional scaffold protein, because the Fe-S cluster can chemically assemble in vitro. The significant activation of IRP1 that occurs when both c-ISCS and c-ISCU are present strongly suggests that the Fe-S cluster assembly on c-ISCU is mediated by c-ISCS. To determine whether the Fe-S cluster of activated IRP1 aconitase was transferred from the scaffold protein c-ISCU, we identified which Mono-Q eluate fractions contained c-ISCU by immunoblotting. IRP1 aconitase activity was acquired only from fractions that contained c-ISCU (Fig. 6C, top two panels), even though equal amounts of apo-IRP1 protein were added to each fraction (Fig. 6C, bottom panel), indicating that IRP1 acquired an Fe-S cluster only when reconstituted c-ISCU was present. These results are consistent with c-ISCS-mediated assembly of a Fe-S cluster in c-ISCU that can be transferred from the reconstituted c-ISCU to IRP1. In addition to using the in-gel activity assay to evaluate ISCS/ISCU-mediated activation of IRP1, aconitase activity was also assessed with the NADP+ reduction spectrophotometric assay. In this coupled assay, active IRP1 aconitase converts cis-aconitate to the isocitrate dehydrogenase substrate, isocitrate, which then undergoes conversion to α-ketoglutarate with concomitant reduction of NADP+ to NADPH, which is measured by absorbance at 340 nm. The coupled aconitase assay indicated that aconitase activity was much greater (>9-fold) in IRP1 incubated with reconstituted c-ISCU than in the control without c-ISCS and c-ISCU (Fig. 6D), which is in agreement with the observation from in-gel aconitase assays (Fig. 6, B and C). Furthermore, reconstitution of aconitase activity increased with time of exposure to reconstituted ISCU (Fig. 6D). We then calculated the percentage of converted [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 from apo-IRP1 with increasing concentration of c-ISCU and c-ISCS for reconstitution to evaluate the efficiency of [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer. The result showed that IRP1 aconitase activity increased, i.e. more apo-IRP1 was converted into [4Fe-4S]-IRP1, with increasing c-ISCS and c-ISCU concentrations in a 30-min assay (Fig. 6E), and ∼17% of apo-IRP1 could be converted to holoprotein within 30 min. Taken together, reconstitution of IRP1 aconitase activity is a function of the concentration of reconstituted c-ISCU and time of incubation, indicating that both human cytosolic ISCS and ISCU are functional in Fe-S cluster assembly. Iron-sulfur clusters are prosthetic groups that are important in diverse processes, ranging from electron transfer reactions, binding of enzymatic substrates, to regulation of biological activity. In bacteria, important iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) proteins are synthesized within the cytoplasm and iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzymes are mostly encoded by the isc operon (1Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), although in A. vinelandii, a separate operon encodes the iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzymes needed for nitrogenase function (21Dos Santos P.C. Smith A.D. Frazzon J. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19705-19711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins are found not only in mitochondria, but also in the cytosolic, nuclear, and chloroplast compartments (22Rouault T.A. Tong W.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and it is important to understand how iron-sulfur proteins acquire their iron-sulfur clusters in physically distinct locations. In yeast, Lill and colleagues (23Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have asserted that all de novo assembly of iron-sulfur proteins takes place within the mitochondrial matrix and that the inner membrane transporter, Atm1, exports iron-sulfur clusters to the cytosol as needed. However, in mammals, multiple elaborate post-transcriptional mechanisms involving alternative AUG utilization or alternative splicing have been identified that generate mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of proteins involved in Fe-S cluster biogenesis (2Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 3Tong W.H. Rouault T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 4Tong W.H. Jameson G.N. Huynh B.H. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9762-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), implying that compartmentalization of Fe-S cluster biogenesis in mammalian cells facilitates acquisition of these unstable prosthetic groups at the different subcellular locations where they are needed. More recently, our hypothesis that iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis occurs in multiple compartments of mammalian cells has been challenged by experiments in which truncated forms of the yeast homologue of ISCS, Nfs1, were used to complement growth defects in S. cerevisiae. It was asserted that yeast Nfs1 containing residues 95–497 could restore Fe-S cluster assembly in yeast, whereas residues 102–497 (which correspond to the sequence of human c-ISCS) could not. It was hypothesized that a critical tyrosine in the 7 residues between residue 95 and residue 102 consisting of the sequence FGTRPIY, was critical for dimerization and function. It was also asserted that tyrosine 101 was present in alignments of all cysteine desulfurases. However, new data base searches reveal that proteins assigned as cysteine desulfurases in Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (Q9KII6), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (P75298), and Mycoplasma genitalium (Q49420) do not contain a tyrosine at a comparable position in the sequence (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the tyrosine residue is not strictly conserved as previously suggested (10Muhlenhoff U. Balk J. Richhardt N. Kaiser J.T. Sipos K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36906-36915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In experiments described in this report, we demonstrate that human c-ISCS exhibits biochemical and enzymatic properties similar to the prototypical cysteine desulfurases of A. vinelandii and S. cerevisiae Nfs1p, despite its lack of a conserved tyrosine at the N terminus. Human c-ISCS dimerizes as efficiently as the IscS of A. vinelandii, providing evidence that the short sequence motif containing a conserved tyrosine is not critical for dimerization of c-ISCS. Moreover, the cysteine desulfurase specific activity of c-ISCS is close to that of yeast, as demonstrated by measurement of cysteine persulfide formation and enzymatic activity. In addition, the present study provides in vitro evidence for c-ISCU function. Previously, it has been suggested that the cytosolic form of ISCU is non-functional, based on the failure of the human cytosolic ISCU modified by addition of a yeast mitochondrial targeting sequence to rescue growth in yeast (24Muhlenhoff U. Gerber J. Richhardt N. Lill R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). It was asserted that the cytosolic isoform of ISCU is the only member of the large Isc/IscU protein family that lacks a highly conserved tyrosine residue at the N terminus (24Muhlenhoff U. Gerber J. Richhardt N. Lill R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, we overexpressed and purified cytosolic ISCU and found that it forms a protein complex with cytosolic ISCS as expected and that these two proteins together facilitate assembly of the iron-sulfur cluster of IRP1 and yeast mitochondrial aconitase (Fig. 5). Moreover, the cytosolic form of ISCU was as efficient as the mature mitochondrial ISCU in converting apo-IRP1 to a functional aconitase. New data base analyses have revealed that numerous members of the ISCU family, including the NifU of Rhodobacter spheroides (Q01180), of Chlamydia pneumoniae (Q9K1T8), numerous Mycoplasma species (Q98R36, Q6KIL2, Q6MTA6, and Q8EV25), and Candidata phytoplasma asteris (Q6YRB5) lack the tyrosine residue in question (Fig. 1B). Finally, RNA interference studies have confirmed that human c-ISCU is crucial for Fe-S cluster assembly in IRP1 in vivo (13Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In summary, we demonstrate here with multiple assays that the cytosolic forms of ISCS and ISCU in mammalian cells are functional. c-ISCS dimerizes and acquires cysteine persulfide as efficiently as the bacterial prototype protein. Cytosolic forms of ISCS and ISCU form a complex and facilitate de novo synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters on both IRP1 and yeast mitochondrial aconitase. Thus, our work here supports the conclusion that cytosolic isoforms of iron-sulfur cluster enzymes are fully functional in mammalian cytosol, and our recent work performing RNA interference on mitochondrial versus cytosolic ISCU isoforms supports that iron-sulfur clusters of cytosolic proteins are synthesized in the cytosolic compartment (13Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Dennis R. Dean for the generous gifts of IscS and NifS from Azotobacter vinelandii."
https://openalex.org/W2040894241,"RNA helicase A (RHA) belongs to the DEAH family of proteins that are capable of unwinding double-stranded RNA structure. In addition to its involvement in the metabolism of cellular RNA, RHA has been shown to stimulate RNA transcription from the long terminal repeat promoter of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) as well as to enhance Rev/Rev response element-mediated gene expression. In this study, we provide evidence that RHA associates with HIV-1 Gag in an RNA-dependent manner. This interaction results in specific incorporation of RHA into HIV-1 particles. Knockdown of endogenous RHA in virus producer cells leads to generation of HIV-1 particles that are less infectious in part as a result of restricted reverse transcription. Therefore, RHA represents the first example of cellular RNA helicases that participate in HIV-1 particle production and promote viral reverse transcription.

Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4398-4407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16822-16830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DEXH-box proteins, together with the DEAD-box and the Ski2 family members, are referred to as RNA helicases that are able to rearrange the structures of RNA molecules (3Rocak S. Linder P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). RHA contains a helicase core domain consisting of seven motifs that are conserved for all RNA helicases. Within the N-terminal region of RHA there are two copies of type A double-stranded RNA binding domains. Together with an RGG-box domain located at the C terminus, double-stranded RNA binding domains regulate RNA binding as well as helicase activities of RHA (4Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). RHA is a nuclear protein and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm with the assistance of a bidirectional nuclear transport domain consisting of 110 amino acids at the C terminus (5Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This function of the RHA nuclear transport domain is subject to regulation of arginine methylation catalyzed by PRMT1 (protein-arginine methyltransferase 1) (6Smith W.A. Schurter B.T. Wong-Staal F. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22795-22798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). RHA is able to unwind double-stranded RNA or DNA with the energy derived from hydrolysis of NTPs by virtue of its NTPase activity (1Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4398-4407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This property enables RHA to participate in multiple cellular processes from RNA transcription to RNA processing to RNA nuclear export (7Zhang S. Grosse F. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. (Shanghai). 2004; 36: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These multiple functions underlie the vital role of RHA in the germ line proliferation and development of Caenorhabditis elegans (8Walstrom K.M. Schmidt D. Bean C.J. Kelly W.G. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and also account for the early embryonic lethality observed with RHA knock-out mice (9Lee C.G. da Costa Soares V. Newberger C. Manova K. Lacy E. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13709-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).The regulation activity of RHA in RNA transcription is implicated by its presence within the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex. For example, RHA has been shown to bridge the interactions between RNA polymerase II and transcription co-activators such as CREB-binding protein and BRAC1 (breast cancer-specific tumor suppressor protein 1) (10Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 11Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Nakajima T. Wolpin E.S. Parvin J.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). RHA also directly interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB and stimulates NF-κB-mediated reporter gene expression (12Tetsuka T. Uranishi H. Sanda T. Asamitsu K. Yang J.P. Wong-Staal F. Okamoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Involvement of RHA in transcription is further indicated by the function of its homologue in Drosophila, named the maleless (MLE) gene, that increases gene expression from the male X chromosome (13Kuroda M.I. Kernan M.J. Kreber R. Ganetzky B. Baker B.S. Cell. 1991; 66: 935-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Lee C.G. Chang K.A. Kuroda M.I. Hurwitz J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). RHA has been found as a component of prespliceosomes (15Hartmuth K. Urlaub H. Vornlocher H.P. Will C.L. Gentzel M. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16719-16724Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), although it is unclear at which step of splicing RHA functions. In regard to RNA nuclear export, RHA directly binds to the constitutive transport element (CTE) RNA of type D retroviruses, such as Mason-Pfizer monkey virus. Together with cellular factors Tap (Tip-associated protein) and HAP95 (helicase A-binding protein 95), RHA promotes export of CTE-containing RNA molecules (16Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Tang H. Wong-Staal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32694-32700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Yang J.P. Tang H. Reddy T.R. Wong-Staal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30694-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).In light of its multiple functions in cellular RNA metabolism, it is not surprising that RHA also regulates the activity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA. For instance, RHA stimulates transcription of HIV-1 RNA (19Fujii R. Okamoto M. Aratani S. Oishi T. Ohshima T. Taira K. Baba M. Fukamizu A. Nakajima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5445-5451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism involves binding of RHA to the transactivation response element (TAR) that is located at the very 5′ end of HIV-1 RNA. This interaction is mediated by the second double-stranded RNA binding domain of RHA, reminiscent of that taking place between TAR and TAR-binding protein (20Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is perceived that, through binding to TAR, RHA either modulates the transactivation activity of Tat or facilitates the transcription activity of RNA polymerase II. RHA also enhances Rev/Rev response element (RRE)-mediated gene expression (21Li J. Tang H. Mullen T.M. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Since RHA exhibits weak interaction with RRE and thus unlikely plays a direct role in the export of HIV-1 full-length RNA, RHA may promote the release of unspliced HIV-1 RNA from spliceosome. In addition to its involvement in HIV-1 gene expression, we now show that RHA associates with the Gag protein and is recruited into virus particles. These results suggest a novel activity of RHA in HIV-1 assembly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid DNA Construction—The Gag-TAP (tandem affinity protein purification) plasmid DNA was generated by replacing the GFP DNA segment with the TAP sequence in the context of Gag-GFP DNA that was described previously (22Guo X. Hu J. Whitney J.B. Russell R.S. Liang C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The TAP sequence was amplified using primers 5′-GCACCTGCAGAAGCGACGATGGAAAAAGAATTC-3′/5′-GCACGATATCTTATT CTTTGTTGAATTTGTTATC-3′ (underlined nucleotides represent the PstI and EcoRV restriction sites) and was inserted into Gag-GFP following digestion with PstI and EcoRV to generate Gag-TAP. Construction of Gag-LZ-TAP involved substituting the leucine zipper (LZ) sequence from yeast transcription factor GCN4 for the NC (nucleocapsid) region of Gag within the Gag-TAP DNA. PCR was performed with primers 5′-GCACACGGGCCCATGAAGCAGCTCGAGG-3′/5′-GCACATCTGCAGTTGTGACGAGGGGTCGTTGCC-3′ (underlined nucleotides represent restriction sites for ApaI and PstI) using BH10-LZ as DNA template (23Guo X. Liang C. Virology. 2005; 335: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The amplified LZ DNA fragment was digested with ApaI and PstI, followed by insertion into Gag-TAP to engineer Gag-LZ-TAP.To generate the hGag-TAP DNA construct, the hGag sequence was first amplified from vector pVRC3900 (kindly provided by Dr. Gary Nabel) with primers 5′-GCATGATATCATGGGCGCCC GCGCCAGCGTG-3′/5′-GCATCTCGAGTTGTGACGAGGGGTCGCTGC-3′ (underlined nucleotides represent EcoRV and XhoI restriction sites), followed by insertion into pcDNA3-C-TAP (kindly provided by Drs. Nahum Sonenberg and Anne-Claude Gingras). DNA constructs D449-TAP, D408-TAP, D390-TAP, and D378-TAP were generated through inserting into pcDNA3-C-TAP the PCR products obtained with the sense primer 5′-GCATGATATCATGGGCGCCCGCGCCAGCGTG-3′ (the underlined nucleotides represent the EcoRV restriction site) together with the following antisense primers: 5′-GCATCTCGAGAAAATTCCCTGGCCTTCCCTTG-3′, 5′-GCATCTCGAGCCAGCAGCCCTTCTTGCGGGG-3′, 5′-GCATCTCGAGCTTGCCGCAGTTGAAGCACTT-3′, 5′-GCATCTCGAGCATGATGGTGGCGCTGTTGG-3′ (the underlined nucleotides represent the XhoI site).The D337/D9664 plasmid DNA was generated with the PCR-based strategy. The 337GAG339 DNA fragment was removed in PCR using primer pair 5′-GTACTTCAAGAACTGCTGACATCCTTGCTACAAGGGACTTTC-3′/5′-GAGCTCCCAGGCTCAGATCTG-3′. The resultant PCR products were used as megaprimers in a second round of PCR together with primer 5′-GCATGTTAACTGGAAGGGCTAATTCACTCCCAAC-3′. The final PCR products were digested with HpaI and BglII, followed by insertion into BH10 to generate BH-D337. Similarly, DNA fragment 9664CTCT9667 was removed in PCR using primers 5′-GTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGTGAGGTAACTAGAGATCCCTCAG-3′/5′-GCTTCTTCCAAGTACTTCTGCAG-3′. The resulting PCR products were used as megaprimers in a second round of PCR together with primer 5′-GTGGGAGCAGCATCTCGAGACCTG-3′. The final PCR products were digested with XhoI and StuI prior to insertion into BH-D337 to generate the D337/D9664 mutated DNA construct.Purification of Gag Protein with the TAP Procedure—The following protocol is adapted from the TAP method (24Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). The 293T cells were transfected with DNA constructs expressing Gag-TAP fusion proteins. Subsequent to washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 0.25 mm NaOVO3,5nm okadaic acid, 5 nm calyculin A, 50 mm glycerolphosphate, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Following clarification at 10,000 × g, the supernatants were incubated with IgG beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with lysis buffer and TEV buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), the Gag-bound IgG beads were incubated with TEV protease (Invitrogen) in TEV buffer at 16 °C for 2 h. The released Gag-TAP proteins were further incubated with calmodulin beads (Amersham Biosciences) in calmodulin-binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgOAc, 1 mm imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After washing with calmodulin-binding buffer and calmodulin rinsing buffer (100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgOAc, 1 mm imidazole, and 2 mm CaCl2), the Gag proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 200 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgOAc, 1 mm imidazole, and 25 mm EGTA. The eluted proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The visible protein bands were excised, in-gel-digested with trypsin, and subject to liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis performed at McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre.Purification of Virus Particles—293T cells were transfected with HIV-1 cDNA. Virus particles in the culture supernatants were first pelleted at 100,000 × g and further purified in a second ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g) through a 15%/65% sucrose step gradient. Virus particles were collected at the 15%/65% sucrose interface and further pelleted at 100,000 × g. The purified virus particles were loaded on the top of a 20-70% continuous sucrose gradient, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected, and the materials were subject to Western blots. In experiments to characterize the association of cellular proteins with viral RNP complex within virus particles, purified viruses were treated with 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min in TN buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl. The treated samples were spun at 10,000 × g, and the pellets were washed three times with TN buffer (25Welker R. Hohenberg H. Tessmer U. Huckhagel C. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Viral RNA Analysis—RNA was prepared from purified virus particles and characterized either in RNase protection assays or in native Northern blots (26Russell R.S. Hu J. Beriault V. Mouland A.J. Laughrea M. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. Liang C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In RNase protection assays, viral RNA was incubated with excessive amounts of 32P-labeled viral RNA probes (nt positions -164 to 321) at 42 °C overnight followed by digestion with single-strand RNA-specific RNases (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The protected RNA fragments were separated on 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels and visualized through exposure to x-ray films. As for native Northern blots, viral RNA first underwent electrophoresis on 0.9% native agarose gels followed by transfer onto nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed with 32P-labeled HIV-1 DNA probes (nt positions 1-2000). Viral RNA signals were visualized through exposure to x-ray films. To assess expression of viral RNA within 293T cells that had been transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides and the BH10 viral DNA construct, total cellular RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and examined in Northern blots.Immunofluorescence Staining—293T cells were transfected with the Gag-GFP DNA construct and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Following treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min, the cells were incubated with anti-RHA rabbit antibodies (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffery D. Parvin) at a dilution of 1:200 for 2 h at 37°C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, a second incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexafluor 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) was performed for 1 h at 37°C. The stained cells were examined using the LSM 5 PASCAL confocal microscope. The images were recorded from layers of 0.9 μm in thickness.Knockdown of RHA with siRNA Oligonucleotides—siRNA oligonucleotides 5′-GAAUGACCUGGGAAGCCAAdTdT-3′ (sense)/5′-UUGGCUUCCCAGGUCAUUCdTdT-3′ (antisense) were designed to target RHA mRNA sequence at nt 2929-2947. Control siRNA oligonucleotides (catalogue number 4611 or 4613) were purchased from Ambion Inc. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect siRNA oligonucleotides into 293T cells. Levels of endogenous RHA were measured in Western blots using anti-RHA antibodies. The same membranes were probed with anti-β-actin antibodies (Sigma) to measure levels of β-actin as an internal control.Primer Extension (27Cen S. Niu M. Kleiman L. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)—The tRNA3Lys-viral RNA template was extracted from purified virus particles, and the relative amount of viral RNA template was determined in slot blot experiments. The tRNA3Lys primer was extended for 6 bases (CTGCTA) from the same amounts of viral RNA templates by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) in a cell-free reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm dCTP, 0.2 mm dTTP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]dGTP, and 0.05 mm ddATP (used to terminate the reaction at the 6-base stage). The products were fractionated in a 5% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and were visualized through exposure to x-ray films.Determination of Viral cDNA Production—The D337/D9664 virus was collected from transfected 293T cells, treated with DNase I to remove plasmid DNA, and purified through the 15%/65% sucrose step gradient. Purified virus particles equivalent to 1 μg of viral capsid (CA) (p24) antigen were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgOAc, 0.4 mm dNTPs, 1 mm n-octyl glycoside, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.04% Triton X-100. Reactions were terminated with buffer containing 1% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.4 m NaCl. Following protease K digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction, newly reverse transcribed viral cDNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 95% ethanol and further assessed in PCR and real time PCR performed with primer pairs 5′-GTACTTCAAGAACTGCTGACATCGAG-3′/5′-GTCTGAGGGATCTCTAGTTACCAGAG-3′ or 5′-CTGGTTAGACCAGATCTGAGCCTG-3′/5′-GTCTGAGGGATCTCTAGTTACCAGAG-3′ Real time PCR was conducted with the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green 1 kit (Roche Diagnostics) in the light cycler machine (Roche Diagnostics).Measurement of Virus Infectivity—An amount of viruses equivalent to 2 ng of viral CA protein was used to infect 5 × 105 MT-2 cells. Virus growth was monitored through determining levels of RT activity in the culture fluids at various time points. Virus infectivity was also determined by performing the MAGI assays (28Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells, that express CD4 and are stably transfected with HIV-1 long terminal repeat-β-galactosidase reporter DNA, were infected with viruses equivalent to 10 ng of viral CA protein. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were fixed and stained using the β-GAL staining kit (Invitrogen). The number of blue cells was scored to determine the infectivity of HIV-1.RESULTSHIV-1 Gag-associated Cellular Factor Candidates Revealed by the Results of Mass Spectrometry—The TAP method has been widely used in yeast proteomic studies and was recently adapted to study protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells (24Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). To identify cellular factors that associate with HIV-1 Gag protein, we have appended the IgG-binding units of protein A from Staphylococcus aureus and the calmodulin-binding peptide to the C terminus of Gag and generated an HIV-1 cDNA clone named Gag-TAP (Fig. 1A) (24Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). These two tags allow isolation of Gag protein from transfected cells to high purity using the IgG beads and the calmodulin beads in a two-step affinity purification procedure. The purified protein samples were subject to mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 1). When N-TAP protein alone was purified from transfected 293T cells and the eluted samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, two protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Blue staining that contained tubulins and ribosomal protein S4, respectively (Fig. 1B). This finding supports the conclusion that the majority of the proteins shown in Fig. 1A were purified as a result of interaction with Gag either in a direct or indirect manner. Among these protein candidates are a group of cellular RNA helicases, including RHA, DEAD-box protein 18 (DDX18), DEAD-box protein 24 (DDX24) and RNA helicase Gu(α). Results of immunoprecipitation and Western blots showed that both RHA and RNA helicase Gu(α) interacted with Gag, yet only RHA was detected to associate with virus particles (data not shown). DDX18 and DDX24 were not tested in these latter experiments due to the lack of antibodies. In this study, we further investigated the potential role of RHA in production of infectious virus particles.FIGURE 1Cellular factors associated with HIV-1 Gag. A, results of mass spectrometry revealing the cellular proteins that were co-purified with HIV-1 Gag protein. Domain structure of the Gag-TAP fusion protein is shown at the top. The calmodulin binding peptide (CBD), TEV protease cleavage site, and protein A (ProtA) sequences are linked to the C terminus of Gag in the context of BH10 (protease-negative) HIV-1 cDNA clone. Following transfection of 293T cells with Gag-TAP, cell lysates were subjected to a two-step affinity purification procedure (available on the World Wide Web at www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/vumcdept/cellbio/gould/). The purified proteins were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The protein bands were analyzed with trypsin in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry. Identity of proteins within each band is shown on the right side of the gels. B, control experiments performed with the N-TAP vector. N-TAP contains the protein A and calmodulin binding peptide sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RHA Associates with HIV-1 Gag Protein in an RNA-dependent Manner—To characterize Gag-RHA interaction, we first examined the Gag complex isolated from transfected 293T cells in Western blots using anti-RHA antibodies. The results showed that RHA was co-purified with Gag but not in the control experiments using the TAP sequence alone (Fig. 2A). When Gag was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of transfected cells using anti-CA antibodies, RHA was also detected in the immunoprecipitated materials in Western blots using anti-RHA antibodies (data not shown). Furthermore, pull-down of the FLAG-RHA protein using anti-FLAG antibody-coated agarose beads led to detection in the purified materials of Gag protein that was expressed from the BH10-PR-DNA co-transfected into 293T cells with the FLAG-RHA DNA construct (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, when the NC domain was replaced with the leucine zipper motif from yeast transcription factor GCN4 (29Accola M.A. Strack B. Gottlinger H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5395-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), the resultant Gag mutant named Gag-LZ-TAP lost the interaction with RHA (Fig. 2A). To validate the essence of NC in Gag-RHA interaction, we tested several Gag mutants that lack various lengths of peptide sequences from the C terminus (Fig. 2C). These Gag mutants were generated using the hGag sequence that contains modified RNA sequence but the same amino acid sequence as the Gag from HIV-1 cDNA clone HXB2 (30Huang Y. Kong W.P. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When the isolated Gag mutants were examined in Western blots using anti-RHA antibodies, similar levels of RHA were observed to associate with the full-length hGag and the hGag mutant D449 that lacked the p6 sequence (Fig. 2C). Further deletion of the zinc finger sequence in mutants D408 and D390 led to substantially decreased amounts of RHA that could be co-purified. In the case of hGag mutant D378 that was missing the entire NC region, interaction with RHA was completely lost.FIGURE 2HIV-1 Gag interacts with RHA within cells in an RNA-dependent manner. A, RHA associates with wild-type HIV-1 Gag but not the Gag mutant Gag-LZ. The mutated Gag-LZ had NC replaced with the leucine zipper sequence from the yeast transcription factor GCN4 (29Accola M.A. Strack B. Gottlinger H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5395-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The Gag-TAP proteins were isolated from transfected 293T cells by affinity purification using the IgG beads and calmodulin beads, followed by analysis in Western blots using either anti-CA or anti-RHA antibodies. N-TAP represents the TAP peptide expressed from the pcDNA3-N-TAP vector and serves as a control in the purification experiments. The lysates of untransfected 293T cells were included in Western blots as a positive control for RHA. B, the BH10-PR-DNA was co-transfected into 293T cells with the FLAG-RHA DNA. The FLAG-RHA protein was precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-coated agarose beads (Sigma), and the pull-down materials were assessed in Western blots using either anti-CA or anti-FLAG antibodies. C, Gag mutant lacking the NC region fails to bind RHA. The C-terminal truncated Gag mutants are illustrated, with the shaded boxes denoting the two zinc finger motifs of NC. Association of RHA with isolated Gag proteins was examined in Western blots using anti-RHA antibodies. D, association of Gag and RHA is sensitive to RNase treatment. The 293T cells were transfected with the Gag-TAP DNA and lysed in a buffer containing 100 μg/ml RNase A. This RNase treatment effectively depleted cellular RNA as shown by the degradation of rRNA. Gag was isolated using the TAP procedure, and levels of associated RHA were measured in Western blots using anti-RHA antibodies. E, colocalization of RHA and Gag within cells. 293T cells were transfected with the Gag-GFP DNA that had the GFP gene appended to the C terminus of Gag in the context of the HIV-1 cDNA clone BH10 (22Guo X. Hu J. Whitney J.B. Russell R.S. Liang C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Endogenous RHA was stained with anti-RHA antibodies and Alexa-fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The essence of NC for Gag and RHA association suggests an RNA-dependent nature of this interaction event. To test this, RNase A was added to cell lysates during Gag purification. The efficiency of RNase A treatment was monitored by the extent of ribosomal rRNA degradation (Fig. 2D). The results of Western blots revealed that RNase A treatment drastically diminished the levels of RHA that could be co-purified with Gag. This indicates that Gag-RHA interaction is RNA-dependent.Colocalization of RHA and Gag within Cells—RHA is a nuclear protein and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (5Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Gag is generally believed to locate within the cytoplasm. It is thus intriguing to determine to which extent RHA and Gag co-localize within cells such that they can interact with each other. Toward this end, 293T cells were transfected with the Gag-GFP construct followed by immunofluorescence staining using anti-RHA antibodies, and images of a few cells are shown in Fig. 2E. The results revealed that RHA was mainly seen within the nucleus with a small detectable amount within the cytoplasm. Notably, a substantial portion of RHA was re"

Questions remain regarding the initial precursor of NO that serves to link organic nitrate to the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). To characterize the mechanism of CPR-CP-mediated organic nitrate bioactivation, EPR, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, NO electrode, and immunoassay studies were performed. With rat hepatic microsomes or purified CPR, the presence of NADPH triggered organic nitrate reduction to NO2-. The CPR flavin site inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium inhibited this NO2- generation, whereas the CP inhibitor clotrimazole did not. However, clotrimazole greatly inhibited NO2--dependent NO generation. Therefore, CPR catalyzes organic nitrate reduction, producing nitrite, whereas CP can mediate further nitrite reduction to NO. Nitrite-dependent NO generation contributed <10% of the CPR-CP-mediated NO generation from organic nitrates; thus, NO2- is not the main precursor of NO. CPR-CP-mediated NO generation was largely thiol-dependent. Studies suggested that organic nitrite (R-O-NO) was produced from organic nitrate reduction by CPR. Further reaction of organic nitrite with free or microsome-associated thiols led to NO or nitrosothiol generation and thus stimulated the activation of sGC. Thus, organic nitrite is the initial product in the process of CRP-CP-mediated organic nitrate activation and is the precursor of NO and nitrosothiols, serving as the link between organic nitrate and sGC activation.

Over the last decade, this role has been attributed to their enzymatic metabolism to produce nitric oxide (NO) (1Arnold W.P. Mittal C.K. Katsuki S. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the mechanism of organic nitrate bioactivation to produce NO has not been elucidated. Numerous reports have shown that the mammalian cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR)-cytochrome P450 (CP) enzyme system plays an important role in the process of organic nitrate biotransformation (5Bennett B.M.

However, questions remain regarding the enzymatic mechanism by which CPR and CP transform organic nitrate to NO. The chemical process of organic nitrate conversion to NO and nitrosothiols that links organic nitrates to the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) remains unknown. Mammalian CPR was first identified in 1950 (11Horecker B.L. Smyrniotis P.Z. Arch. Biochem. 1950; 29: 232-233PubMed Google Scholar). CPR is a flavoprotein containing both FAD and FMN (11Horecker B.L.

Previous studies have shown that CPR plays important roles in organic nitrate biotransformation. The flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) greatly inhibits the metabolic activation of GTN or ISDN through inhibition of CPR (8McGuire J.J. Anderson D.J. McDonald B.J. Narayanasami R.

However, the enzymatic mechanism of CPR-mediated organic nitrate reduction has not been elucidated. To date, no research has been done to assess NO formation in the process of CPR-mediated organic nitrate biotransformation. It is not certain whether CPR can directly catalyze the reduction of organic nitrate to produce NO or to produce nitrite anion (NO2-) or other species as intermediates that may be further transformed to NO or S-nitrosothiols. Therefore, the enzymatic mechanism of NO and S-nitrosothiol generation remains unclear in the process of organic nitrate bioactivation. CPR is the electron donor for several oxygenase enzymes, including CP, a family of hemeproteins involved in the metabolism of many drugs and dietary substances and in the synthesis of steroid hormones and other extracellular lipid signaling molecules. It has been reported that the activation of sGC by GTN can be inhibited by inhibitors of CP and suggested that at least a portion of the vascular biotransformation of GTN is mediated by CP (16Bennett B.M. McDonald B.J. St. James M.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 261: 716-723PubMed Google Scholar, 17Delaforge M. Servent D. Wirsta P. Ducrocq C. Mansuy D. Lenfant M. Chem. Biol.

Therefore, controversy remains regarding whether CP can mediate organic nitrate biotransformation to NO, and the mechanism of this biotransformation process remains unknown. Although numerous studies have shown that the CPR-CP system plays an important role in the process of bioactivation of organic nitrate, controversy still exists over which of these two enzymes are involved and how they interact in the mechanism by which NO and nitrosothiols are generated. This information is of particular importance to understand the cellular mechanisms by which these compounds are metabolized and bioactivated in vivo as well as the process by which tolerance occurs, rendering these compounds less active as vasodilators. To characterize the enzymatic mechanism of CPR-CP-catalyzed organic nitrate reduction and to elucidate the precise molecular mechanism of organic nitrate bioactivation, EPR, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, NO electrode, and immunoassay studies were performed under anaerobic conditions to characterize the initial product, the precursor of NO and nitrosothiols, and to determine the link between organic nitrate and sGC activation. This study demonstrates that CPR catalyzes the bioactivation of organic nitrate through reduction to form the intermediate organic nitrite, which is converted to NO and nitrosothiols in a thiol-dependent reaction. Materials—DPI chloride, sodium nitrite, Griess reagent, β-NADPH, β-NADH, cytochrome P450 2B4, NADPH P450 reductase (human recombinant), a cytochrome c reductase activity assay kit, and a protein concentration assay kit were obtained from Sigma. sGC was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). A direct cGMP assay kit was obtained from Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI), and cGMP production was quantified by immunoassay according to the protocol provided by the company. Anti-cytochrome P450 reductase antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). GTN was synthesized as described (23Meah Y. Brown B.J. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8560-8565Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). N-Methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD) was synthesized using carbon disulfide and N-methyl-d-glucamine (24Shinobu L.A. Jones S.G. Jones M.M. Acta Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1984; 54: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 304-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Ferrous ammonium sulfate was purchased from Aldrich (99.997%). Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Invitrogen. Millipore Ultrafree centrifugal filters (nominal Mr limit of 10,000) were obtained from Fisher. Preparation of Rat Liver Microsomes—Microsomal fractions from rat liver were prepared by standard differential centrifugation techniques. Liver microsomes were prepared from individual male Wistar rats (250-300 g) (8McGuire J.J. Anderson D.J. McDonald B.J. Narayanasami R. Bennett B.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 881-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26McDonald B.J. Bennett B.M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1990; 68: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Rat liver microsomes (100,000 × g pellet) were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Protein concentrations were determined by a modification of the Lowry method using the Sigma protein concentration assay kit. CPR activity was measured by following the NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c using a Sigma CPR activity assay kit. Reaction rates were calculated using an extinction coefficient for ferrous cytochrome c of 21 mm-1 cm-1 at 550 nm. Microsomes (3.6 g of protein) were prepared from 10 rats (175 g of livers) and stored at -80 °C in PBS at a concentration of ∼10 mg/ml protein (∼1.1 ± 0.2 units/ml CPR; 1 unit will cause the reduction of 1.0 μmol of cytochrome c by NADPH/min at pH 7.0 at 37 °C). EPR Spectroscopy—EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker EMX spectrometer with an HS resonator operating at X-band. Measurements were performed at ambient temperature with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, a modulation amplitude of 2.5 G, and a microwave power of 20 milliwatts. NO generated from the reaction solution was purged out using argon to a vessel containing 5 ml of the Fe2+·MGD spin-trap solution as described previously (27Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16939-16946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This setup was designed to isolate the reaction solution from the spin trap and thus avoid any possible perturbation caused by Fe2+·MGD complexes in the reaction system. Fe2+·MGD complexes were prepared by adding solid ferrous ammonium sulfate and MGD (1:5 molar ratio) to the deoxygenated (argon-purged) solution with a final concentration of 2 mm iron. Fe3+·MGD complexes were prepared by mixing ferric chloride and aerobic MGD solution (1:5 molar ratio) with a final concentration 2 mm iron. Quantitation of NO formation and trapping was performed by double integration of the observed EPR signal compared with that from the similar aqueous NO·Fe2+·MGD standard (27Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16939-16946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence Measurements—The rate of the NO production was measured using a Sievers 270B nitric oxide analyzer interfaced through a DT2821 A/D board to a personal computer. In the analyzer, NO is reacted with ozone, forming excited-state NO2, which emits light. Mixing of reagents and separation of NO from the reaction mixture were done at controlled temperature in a glass purging vessel equipped with heating jacket. The release of NO was quantified by analysis of the digitally recorded signal from the photomultiplier tube using specially designed data acquisition and analysis software developed in our laboratory (28Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). After an initial 60-120 s of equilibration of flow from the purging vessel to the detector, the signal provides the rate of NO formation over time. As described previously (29Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), nitrite in the solution is measured from its reduction to NO under conditions of acidic pH in the presence of glacial acetic acid and 1% KI. This method has been shown to be highly sensitive, enabling detection of nitrite down to picomole amounts. Neither GTN nor ISDN was found to generate any detectable NO under these conditions. Calibration of the magnitude of nitrite and NO production was determined from the integral of the signal over time compared with that from nitrite concentration standards (29Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Electrochemical Measurements—Electrochemical measurements of NO generation under anaerobic conditions were carried out at 37 °C in a sealed electrochemical vial using a CHI 832 electrochemical detector (CH Instruments, Inc., Austin, TX) and a Clark-type NO electrode (ISO-NOP, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). A slow flow of argon gas was maintained in the space above the solution. The electrochemical detector continuously recorded the current through the working electrode, which is proportional to the NO concentration in the solution. The sensor was calibrated before and after experiments with known concentrations of NO using NO equilibrated solutions. Assay of S-Nitrosothiol—The concentrations of S-nitrosothiol were determined from the increase in nitrite concentration after treatment of samples with HgCl2. Spectrophotometric quantitation of nitrite with Griess reagent was performed according to the protocol provided by Sigma using a Varian Cary 300 UV-visible spectrophotometer. One milliliter of sample was supplemented with 50 μl of 10 mm HgCl2 and 1 ml of Griess reagent for 10 min at room temperature. Background levels of nitrite in the samples were determined using Griess reagent without the addition of HgCl2. The standard curve was obtained with a known amount of nitrite. Immunoassay of Guanylyl Cyclase Activity—Activation of sGC was investigated by enzyme-linked immunoassay. After incubation of microsomes (4 mg/ml protein) and GTN (10 μm) or ISDN (100 μm) with 1 ml of reaction buffer (10 ng of sGC, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 100 μm NADPH in 1 ml of PBS) at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions, the enzymes in the samples were removed using Millipore filters (centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Measurements of cGMP in the solution were performed by immunoassay using the direct cGMP assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The standard curve was obtained with known amounts of cGMP. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as the means ± S.D. of at least three repeated measurements, and statistical significance of difference was evaluated by Student's t test. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate statistical significance. Inorganic Nitrite Generation from Organic Nitrate Reduction—NO2- has normally been assumed to be the initial product of organic nitrate metabolism and the precursor of NO that accounts for the bioactivity of organic nitrates. To investigate the mechanism and magnitude of CPR-CP-mediated organic nitrate reduction with NO2- formation as well as the possible role of nitrite as an intermediate in NO production, the rates of nitrite formation derived from the organic nitrates GTN and ISDN were measured under anaerobic conditions. The reaction mixture was sampled every 5 min, and the nitrite concentration was determined by NO analyzer analysis with reduction of nitrite to NO using 1% KI under acidic conditions. In the presence of ISDN (100 μm) or GTN (10 μm) with either 100 μm NADPH or 1 mm NADH as electron donor, a large amount of nitrite was generated upon the addition of microsomes (2 mg/ml protein) (Fig. 1A). Nitrite concentrations in the reaction mixture linearly increased at first and then started to plateau with a decrease in nitrite generation rates. For either ISDN or GTN, we observed that 100 μm NADPH triggered about twice as much nitrite generation compared with 1 mm NADH as reducing substrate (Fig. 1A, trace a versus trace c and trace b versus trace d). Thus, NADPH is a much more efficient electron donor than is NADH in the process of CPR-CP-mediated organic nitrate reduction. The flavin site inhibitor DPI greatly inhibited nitrite generation (Fig. 1A, trace e), whereas the CP inhibitor clotrimazole (5 μm) or carbon monoxide showed no inhibition (data not shown). Thus, CPR is the main enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of organic nitrate to nitrite. To further verify that CPR catalyzes the reduction of organic nitrate to nitrite and thus to confirm the enzymatic role of CPR in the process of organic nitrate biotransformation, studies were performed using purified recombinant CPR, and comparative studies of nitrite generation from GTN or ISDN reduction were carried out. In the presence of ISDN (100 μm) or GTN (10 μm) and 100 μm NADPH, following the addition of recombinant CPR (0.02 mg/ml), a large amount of nitrite was generated (Fig. 1B). The observed rate of nitrite formation with ISDN (100 μm) was about twice that with GTN (10 μm). This CPR-dependent nitrite generation was totally inhibited by the flavin site inhibitor DPI. These results demonstrate that CPR is highly effective in triggering organic nitrate reduction, leading to nitrite formation. The concentration dependence of nitrite production from CPR in microsomes was determined as a function of GTN (1-100 μm) or ISDN (0.01-3 mm) concentration. The initial rate of nitrite formation was determined from the ratio of the increase in nitrite concentration during the first 5 min. With NADPH (100 μm) or NADH (1 mm) as reducing substrate, the initial rate of nitrite formation was determined as a function of GTN (Fig. 2, A and B) or ISDN (Fig. 2, C and D) concentration, and Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed with a correlation coefficient (γ2) of >98% (Fig. 2). The apparent Km and Vmax values are shown under each curve. The apparent Km values for GTN and ISDN are higher than typical clinical levels of organic nitrates in tissues or blood. Thus, at pharmacological levels of GTN (lower micromolar range) or ISDN (10-100 μm), the rate of organic nitrate reduction would be expected to increase linearly with the given organic nitrate dose (Fig. 2). From the observed concentration-dependent kinetics of nitrite formation from these organic nitrates, we can further consider the possible contribution of nitrite as precursor of NO in the process of organic nitrate biotransformation. Nitric Oxide Generation from CPR-CP-mediated GTN or ISDN Reduction—It is well known that organic nitrates such as GTN and ISDN are prodrugs requiring metabolism to generate bioactive NO. To investigate whether CPR-CP can catalyze the reduction of these organic nitrates to NO and to quantitate their NO generation, EPR spectroscopy was applied to directly measure GTN- and ISDN-mediated NO generation under anaerobic conditions. NO generated was purged from the reaction vessel using argon to a secondary vessel containing the spin trap Fe2+·MGD. NO is paramagnetic and binds with high affinity to the water-soluble spin trap Fe2+·MGD, forming the mononitrosyl iron complex NO·Fe2+·MGD with a characteristic triplet spectrum at g = 2.04 and hyperfine splitting aN = 12.8. From the intensity of the observed spectrum, quantitative measurement of NO generation can be performed (31Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18797-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 33Lancaster Jr., J.R. Langrehr J.M. Bergonia H.A. Murase N. Simmons R.L. Hoffman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10994-10998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With ISDN (100 μm) or GTN (10 μm) in the presence of NADPH (100 μm) or NADH (1 mm), no signal was seen (Fig. 3A). In the presence of NADPH (100 μm), microsomes (2 mg/ml protein) were added, and this triggered marked NO generation from 10 μm GTN with 0.21 μm NO trapped over 30 min (Fig. 3B) and from 100 μm ISDN with 0.19 μm NO trapped (Fig. 3C). With 1 mm NADH as electron donor, microsomes (2 mg/ml protein) also triggered 0.10 μm NO generation from 100 μm ISDN (Fig. 3D). The CPR flavin site inhibitor DPI (50 μm) effectively blocked microsome-mediated NO formation (Fig. 3E). In contrast, the CP inhibitor clotrimazole (5 μm) showed no significant inhibition (Fig. 3F); and similarly, carbon monoxide did not alter the observed NO generation (data not shown). This suggests that CPR is the primary microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of organic nitrate to nitrite and NO. To further quantitate the rates of NO generation from microsomal CPR-CP-mediated GTN and ISDN reduction, studies were performed using a chemiluminescence NO analyzer. NO was purged from the solution by argon and then reacted with ozone in the analyzer to form excited-state NO2, which emits light. This method provides direct measurement of the rate of NO generation as a function of time. In the presence of NADPH (100 μm) with GTN (10 or 50 μm), the addition of microsomes (2 mg/ml protein) triggered prominent NO generation (Fig. 4A, traces a and b). In the presence of NADH (1 mm) with GTN (10 μm), the addition of microsomes (2 mg/ml protein) triggered GTN reduction to produce a relatively small amount of NO (Fig. 4A, trace c). The presence of the flavin site inhibitor DPI greatly inhibited NO generation (Fig. 4A, trace d). CPR-CP-mediated ISDN reduction was similar to GTN reduction. In the presence of microsomes (2 mg/ml), ISDN (100 or 500 μm) was reduced to NO with either NADPH (100 μm) (Fig. 4B, trace a or b) or NADH (1 mm) (trace c) as reducing substrate. This NO generation was totally inhibited by the flavin site inhibitor DPI (Fig. 4B, trace d). To further confirm these observations and to quantitate the NO concentration that accumulated, NO generation was measured by electrochemical detection. Prior to the addition of microsomes, there was no detectable NO. After the addition of microsomes (2 mg/ml protein), NO generation was triggered from ISDN (500 or 100 μm) and NADPH (100 μm) (Fig. 5, traces A and B). This NO generation was inhibited by DPI (Fig. 5C). Thus, EPR, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, and NO electrode studies demonstrate NO generation from CPR-CP-mediated organic nitrate reduction. Under similar conditions, the NO generation rate detected by EPR was similar to that detected using the chemiluminescence NO analyzer and to the initial rate detected by NO electrode analysis. A comparative study of NO generation from recombinant CPR-mediated organic nitrate reduction was performed. With ISDN (100 μm)in the presence of CPR (0.02 mg/ml) and NAPDH (100 μm), no significant NO generation was seen (Fig. 6, trace B). To test whether sulfhydryl compounds play a role in CPR-mediated transformation of organic nitrates, l-cysteine (5 mm) was added, and this triggered marked NO generation from 100 μm ISDN at a rate of 12 nm min-1 (Fig. 6, trace A). With 10 μm GTN, l-cysteine (5 mm) similarly triggered NO formation at a peak rate of 18 nm min-1. The FAD site inhibitor DPI (50 μm) totally blocked this CPR-dependent NO formation (data not shown). As described above with microsomes instead of purified recombinant CPR, prominent NO generation occurred in the absence of added thiols (Figs. 3, 4, 5). This suggests that sulfhydryl groups in the microsomal proteins or enzymes may play important roles in the process of organic nitrate biotransformation to NO. Nitric Oxide Generation from NO2- Reduction—NO2- has normally been assumed to be the initial product of organic nitrate metabolism and the precursor of NO. To assess the contribution of NO generation from NO2- in organic nitrate biotransformation, nitrite-dependent NO generation was measured using a chemiluminescence NO analyzer. In the presence of NADPH (100 μm), the addition of 20 or 40 μm nitrite triggered NO generation at ∼2.8 or ∼4.5 nm min-1 from microsomes (2 mg/ml) (Fig. 7A). The rates of NO generation from CPR-CP-mediated nitrite (10-200 μm) reduction with 100 μm NADPH (trace a) and 1 mm NADH (trace b) are shown in Fig. 7B. The CP inhibitor clotrimazole (5 μm) greatly inhibited nitrite-dependent NO generation (Fig. 7B, trace c). Therefore, it is CP that catalyzed nitrite reduction to NO in microsomes. Of note, with the same amount of microsomes, the reduction of 100 μm ISDN or 10 μm GTNby100 μm NADPH produced only ∼4.8 or 3.4 μm total nitrite, respectively, over 30 min (Fig. 1A, traces a and b). Nitrite-dependent NO generation kinetics (Fig. 7A) revealed that NO generation from nitrite reduction contributed <10% of the total NO generation in the process of organic nitrate biotransformation. Our results suggest that nitrite is not the primary precursor of NO in the process of microsomal CPR-CP-mediated organic nitrate biotransformation. A comparative study of NO generation from isolated CP-mediated nitrite reduction was performed. Isolated CP 2B4 was obtained from Sigma with ∼0.2 units of CPR activity/mg of protein. In the presence of 100 μm NADPH, the addition of 100 μm nitrite triggered significant NO generation at a rate of ∼6 nm min-1 (Fig. 7C, trace c). NO generation from nitrite was increased with an increase in nitrite concentration (Fig. 7C, trace b) or CP concentration (trace a) in the reaction mixture. Furthermore, this NO generation derived from nitrite was greatly inhibited by the CP inhibitor cyanide (Fig. 7C, trace d). Effects of pH on CPR-mediated Nitrite Generation and CP-mediated NO Generation—To assess organic nitrate bioactivation under different physiological or pathological conditions and to further characterize the mechanism of CPR-CP-mediated organic nitrate reduction, experiments were performed to measure the effect of pH on the magnitude of nitrite generation from CPR-mediated organic nitrate reduction and on the magnitude of NO generation from CP-mediated nitrite reduction.

However, the direct functional role of ghrelin and its receptor in tumors of central nervous system origin remains to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that the human astrocytoma cell lines U-118, U-87, CCF-STTG1, and SW1088 express 6-, 11-, 15-, and 29-fold higher levels of GHS-R compared with primary normal human astrocytes. The ligation of GHS-R by ghrelin on these cells resulted in an increase in intracellular calcium mobilization, protein kinase C activation, actin polymerization, matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity, and astrocytoma motility. In addition, ghrelin led to actin polymerization and membrane ruffling on cells, with the specific co-localization of the small GTPase Rac1 with GHS-R on the leading edge of the astrocytoma cells and imparting the tumor cells with a motile phenotype. Disruption of the endogenous ghrelin/GHS-R pathway by RNA interference resulted in diminished motility, matrix metalloproteinase activity, and Rac expression, whereas tumor cells stably overexpressing GHS-R exhibited increased cell motility. The relevance of ghrelin and GHS-R expression was verified in clinically relevant tissues from 20 patients with oligodendrogliomas and grade II–IV astrocytomas. Analysis of a central nervous system tumor tissue microarray revealed that strong GHS-R and ghrelin expression was significantly more common in high grade tumors compared with low grade ones. Together, these findings suggest a novel role for the ghrelin/GHS-R axis in astrocytoma cell migration and invasiveness of cancers of central nervous system origin.

Ghrelin, a 28-amino acid acylated orexigenic peptide, is believed to be largely secreted from X/A-like cells of the stomach (1Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K.

The ghrelin gene encodes a 117-amino acid precursor peptide (preproghrelin) that shares 82% homology between rat and human (1Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K.

Nature. 2000; 407: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). The post-translational acyl modification of ghrelin is believed to be critical for its ability to bind to GHS-R and to mediate its biological activities (1Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M.

Given that this octanoic group confers hydrophobicity to the N terminus of ghrelin, it may be that this group is responsible for specific targeting of ghrelin to lipid rafts (8Dixit V.D.

The deacylated (desacyl) form of ghrelin does not appear to mediate effects attributed to GHS-R; however, it has been reported recently that transgenic mice over expressing the desacyl form of ghrelin are small and have a blunted GH/IGF-1 axis, supporting a biologically relevant regulatory role for this isoform (10Ariyasu H.

However, little is known about the expression of ghrelin or GHS-R in central nervous system cancers. Astrocytomas are the most common central nervous system tumors, and the malignant forms include anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III) and glioblastoma (grade IV). These brain tumors are a major cause of cancer-related mortality, with a life expectancy of 1–3 years despite a multimodal therapy (39Maher E.A. Furnari F.B. Bachoo R.M. Rowitch D.H. Louis D.N. Cavenee W.K. DePinho R.A. Genes. Dev. 2001; 15: 1311-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). These tumors are especially difficult to treat due to their high proliferation rate, increased angiogenesis, and invasion into surrounding brain tissues (40Burton E.C. Prados M.D. Curr. Treat. Options Oncol. 2000; 1: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Given that ghrelin has been identified recently as a positive regulator of the somatotropic axis, which has been shown to influence central nervous system tumor growth, we sought to determine whether this protein or its receptor plays any direct role in astrocytoma cell growth and function. Our findings provide the first evidence for the existence of ghrelin/GHS-R signaling pathways in astrocytomas and demonstrate that an endogenous hormonal loop may play a critical role in astrocytoma motility and invasiveness. Cells and Reagents—Four human glial cell lines (CCF-STTG1, U-87, U-118, and SW1088 cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured as recommended by the supplier, and primary human astrocytes were purchased from Cambrex Corp. (Baltimore, MD). The octanoylated ghrelin-(1–18) fragment (Peptides International, Inc., Louisville, KY) was used to treat the cells in culture. Intracellular Calcium Mobilization and Actin Polymerization—Measurement of intracellular calcium release in response to ghrelin was performed as described previously (8Dixit V.D. Schaffer E.M. Pyle R.S. Collins G.D. Sakthivel S.K. Palaniappan R. Lillard Jr., J.W. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ along with 5 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were subsequently washed and then resuspended at 1 × 106/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. A total of 2 ml of the cell suspension was placed in a continuously stirred cuvette at room temperature in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrophotometer. Fluorescence was monitored at λex1 = 340 nm, λex2 = 380 nm, and λem = 510 nm. The data are presented as the relative ratio of fluorescence excited at 340 and 380 nm. For the actin polymerization studies, astrocytoma cells were incubated with ghrelin (100 ng/ml) for 20 min, after which the cells were fixed and permeabilized in 2% paraformaldehyde solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The fixed and permeabilized cells were subsequently labeled for F-actin using Alexa Fluor 594-labeled phalloidin, and the nucleus was counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence Staining—Immunofluorescence staining and microscopy were performed as described previously (8Dixit V.D. Schaffer E.M. Pyle R.S. Collins G.D. Sakthivel S.K. Palaniappan R. Lillard Jr., J.W. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed and permeabilized using 2% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% Triton X-100, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked using an Fc block (Pharmingen) and 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with different combinations of human anti-GHS-R goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-ghrelin rabbit IgG and anti-preproghrelin rabbit IgG (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Belmont, CA), anti-Rac mouse IgG (Sigma), and anti-golgin-97 mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Cells were examined by high resolution microscopy, and images were acquired using SPOT Advanced software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope under an ×100 objective lens. Small Interfering RNA Knockdown Experiments—For all transfection studies, each of the astrocytoma lines was seeded in 6-well plates until 80% confluent. Control scrambled and GHS-R1a small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were designed, synthesized, and labeled with rhodamine (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). In addition, two separate ghrelin siRNA sequences (Sequence 1 from Qiagen Inc. and Sequence 2 from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO)) were also utilized to specifically knockdown ghrelin expression by these cell lines. For each of the siRNA constructs, the astrocytoma cells were transfected using Lipofectamine-based RNAifect reagent (Qiagen Inc.), after which these cells were utilized for the functional studies 24–48 h later. Generation of Cell Lines Stably Expressing GHS-R1a—The full-length human GHS-R 1a cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AY429112) cloned into the pcDNA3.1+ vector was purchased from University of Missouri cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). The open reading frame was amplified by PCR from human brain cDNA (Clontech), and the insert was sequenced-verified at 1101 bp. U-87 cells were cultured to 80% confluency and transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid (Invitrogen) containing cDNA for GHS-R1a or with empty vector alone using LyoVec reagent (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Selection was carried out by adding Geneticin (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 500 μg/ml over a period of 30 days, and colonies were picked, expanded, and screened for expression by PCR. Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells using QIAshredder and RNeasy kits (Qiagen Inc.) and from different grades of tumor tissues using standard procedures (8Dixit V.D. Schaffer E.M. Pyle R.S. Collins G.D. Sakthivel S.K. Palaniappan R. Lillard Jr., J.W. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The isolated RNA (2 μg) and oligo(dT) primers were utilized to synthesize single-stranded cDNA using a reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR was set up using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) along with 1 μl of cDNA and the gene-specific primers at a final concentration of 0.3 μm. Thermal cycling was carried out on an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp 7700 sequence detector, and SYBR green dye intensity was analyzed using GeneAmp 7700 SDS software. The human GHS-R1a and ghrelin primers utilized in these studies were described previously (11Gnanapavan S. Kola B. Bustin S.A. Morris D.G. McGee P. Fairclough P. Bhattacharya S. Carpenter R. Grossman A.B. Korbonits M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2988-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). No PCR products were generated from genomic versus cDNA template. Ghrelin Assay—Immunoreactive ghrelin was measured in duplicate by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the full-length ghrelin peptide (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Motility and Invasion Assays—Scratch and Transwell invasion assays were performed as described previously (41Weeraratna A.T. Jiang Y. Hostetter G. Rosenblatt K. Duray P. Bittner M. Trent J.M. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). For the scratch assays, astrocytoma cells were placed in 12-well plates coated with fibronectin (Pharmingen). After the cells were allowed to attach and reach confluency, a scratch was made through the fibronectin, and photographs of cells invading the scratch were taken at the indicated time points. Alternatively, cells were also fixed and stained with hematoxylin and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled phalloidin. For the Transwell invasion assays, cells were labeled with 5 mm calcein acetoxymethyl ester at 37 °C for 1 h and then placed on Matrigel-coated Transwell filters as described (41Weeraratna A.T. Jiang Y. Hostetter G. Rosenblatt K. Duray P. Bittner M. Trent J.M. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). A total of 800 μl of media containing various concentrations of ghrelin was placed in the lower chambers to generate a chemoattractant gradient. Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times, and readings were performed on a Cytofluor 4000 fluorescent plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 530 nm, respectively. Data are represented as the means ± S.E., and analysis of variance with Tukey's test was used to determine the statistical significance (p < 0.05). Gelatin Zymography—Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of ghrelin for 24–48 h, after which the conditioned medium was collected, diluted in sample buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris (pH 6.8), 0.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue), and separated by electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin as a substrate. SDS was removed by washing the gel with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide). Gel staining was performed for 1 h at room temperature with 0.25% Coomassie Blue R-250, 50% methanol, and 7.5% acetic acid, after which the gel was destained with 10% acetic acid until clear bands representing proteinase activity appeared over a dark background. Western Blot Analysis—Control and treated cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined. These lysates (30 μg) were diluted with sample buffer, separated on 4–20% Tris-HCl/SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). The blots were then incubated with rabbit antibody raised against phosphorylated protein kinase C (PKC) or total PKC (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) or with an actin-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Immune complexes were visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Tissue Microarrays and Immunohistochemistry—The tissue microarrays utilized in these studies contained cores from 20 glioblastomas, 20 anaplastic astrocytomas, 20 infiltrating astrocytomas, and 20 oligodendroglial lesions (42Boon K. Edwards Eberhart J.B. Riggins C. G.G.J. BMC Cancer. 2004; 4: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Microscopic examination of these arrays by a certified neuropathologist confirmed that the appearance of the tumor tissue cores corresponded to that in the donor blocks. To assess the expression of ghrelin and GHS-R on these tissue arrays, paraffin-embedded tumors were sectioned and deparaffinized using xylene, 100% EtOH, 95% EtOH, 75% EtOH, and H2O series, and antigens were retrieved by steaming samples in Dako target retrieval buffer for 20 min as described previously (41Weeraratna A.T. Jiang Y. Hostetter G. Rosenblatt K. Duray P. Bittner M. Trent J.M. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). After blocking the nonspecific binding sites, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies. The sections were stained with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate and counterstained with Meyer's hematoxylin. Negative controls (obtained by occulting the primary antibody or by using an unrelated IgG) demonstrated no specific labeling. An investigator was blinded to the tissue array, which was then graded for immunopositivity of GHS-R and ghrelin based on the strength of the specific cytoplasmic labeling on a scale of 0 (no staining), 1+ (weak staining), 2+ (moderate staining), and 3+ (strong staining). The significance of the differences in GHS-R and ghrelin expression was examined by performing a Fisher's exact test analysis on a four-way contingency table containing low grade versus high grade tumors and weak/no versus moderate/strong staining. Functional Ghrelin Receptor Is Overexpressed in Human Astrocytoma Cells—The presence of GHS-R mRNA has been detected in many forms of cancer (30Jeffery P.L. Herington A.C. Chopin L.K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 14: 113-122Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar); however, GHS-R gene and protein expression in astrocytoma cells is currently unknown. Using immunofluorescence labeling, we observed that the GHS-R protein is widely expressed in the CCF-STTG1 cell line (Fig. 1A) and in the astrocytoma cell lines U-87, U-118, and SW1088 (Fig. 1B). It is interesting that normal human astrocytes (NHAs) demonstrated only very weak immunopositivity for GHS-R (Fig. 1B) compared with the astrocytoma cell lines. Moreover, ghrelin treatment resulted in the redistribution of GHS-R to the membrane ruffles on the leading edges of these cells (Fig. 1A, lower left panel), suggesting a role for GHS-R in interactions with adjacent cells or in cell migration. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis also revealed overexpression of GHS-R1a mRNA in all astrocytoma cell lines tested, with the highest expression (30-fold) in SW1088 cells compared with NHAs (Fig. 1C). We next investigated the functionality and responsiveness of GHS-R-positive astrocytoma cells to acylated ghrelin. Ligation of GPCRs is often accompanied by the dramatic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and cell-surface molecules and the formation of membrane ruffles (43Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). Moreover, ligand binding to many functional GPCRs also results in mobilization of calcium from the intracellular stores via the generation of inositol triphosphate (44Sanchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). This intracellular calcium results in the activation of PKC, which plays a role in actin polymerization, cell motility, and glioma progression (45da Rocha A.B. Mans D.R. Regner A. Schwartsmann G. The Oncologist. 2002; 7: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similar to other GPCRs, ghrelin treatment of astrocytoma cells induced a marked increase in actin polymerization along with membrane ruffling and development of structures resembling lamellipodia compared with the vehicle control (Fig. 2A). In addition, we also observed a significant increase in intracellular calcium release in the U-87 astrocytoma cell line upon ghrelin treatment (Fig. 2C). Because activation of PKC downstream of intracellular calcium release is associated with cytoskeletal changes as well as"

https://openalex.org/W2027486667,"The Earth's mantle is isotopically heterogeneous on length scales ranging from centimetres to more than 10(4) kilometres. This heterogeneity originates from partial melt extraction and plate tectonic recycling, whereas stirring during mantle convection tends to reduce it. Here we show that mid-ocean ridge basalts from 2,000 km along the southeast Indian ridge (SEIR) display a bimodal hafnium isotopic distribution. This bimodality reveals the presence of ancient compositional striations (streaks) in the Indian Ocean upper mantle. The number density of the streaks is described by a Poisson distribution, with an average thickness of approximately 40 km. Such a distribution is anticipated for a well-stirred upper mantle, in which heterogeneity is continually introduced by plate tectonic recycling, and redistributed by viscous stretching and convective refolding."

First, by comparing a fast-cycling mutant (Arf6(T157N)) and a GTPase-deficient mutant (Arf6(Q67L)), we established the necessity for completion of the Arf6 GDP/GTP cycle for recycling of major histocompatibility complex molecules to the plasma membrane. Second, we found that aluminum fluoride (AlF), known for inducing membrane protrusion in cells expressing exogenous wild-type Arf6, stabilized a functional wild-type Arf6·AlFx · GTPase-activating protein (GAP) complex in vitro and in vivo.

Finally, competition experiments conducted in vivo suggest the existence of a membrane receptor for GDP-bound Arf6. The small G protein Arf6 (ADP-ribosylation factor-6) is involved in a wide variety of cellular events, including cell adhesion and migration, endocytosis, secretion, phagocytosis, and formation of invadopodia (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 2Donaldson J.G. J. Biol.

It is believed to accomplish these diverse functions by modulating plasma membrane rearrangement, actin cytoskeleton organization, and intracellular transport. Classically, small G proteins are seen as molecular switches that cycle between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. This implies that a GTPase-defective mutant locked in a GTP-bound form would reproduce the functions controlled by the corresponding activated small G protein. However, it has long been appreciated for many G proteins that GTP hydrolysis as well is necessary to elicit the full biological response, suggesting that the completion of the full GDP/GTP cycle is important. For instance, the transforming mutant Ras(F28L) was found to display a dramatic decreased affinity for both nucleotides (5Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Frech M. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17700-17706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant cycles at an enhanced rate between its GDP- and GTP-bound states and is called “fast-cycling.” The analogous Cdc42(F28L), Rac1(F28L), and Rho(AF30L) mutants were also found to be fast-cycling proteins with tumorigenic activity (6Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 7Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is interesting that, in contrast to its fast-cycling mutant, the GTPase-defective mutant of Cdc42 does not confer the transforming characteristics when expressed in cells. The nucleotide cycle of the small G proteins of the Rab and Ran families is also critical to ensure the vectorial transport of vesicles and the shuttling in and out the nucleus, respectively (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 8Kuersten S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 497-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The requirement for the completion of the nucleotide cycle has also been documented for Arf1 involved at different stages in the formation of coat complex protein I vesicles (9Yang J.S. Lee S.Y. Gao M. Bourgoin S. Randazzo P.A. Premont R.T. Hsu V.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that, in many cases, to recapitulate the biological functions of small G proteins, mutants that cycle constitutively between their GDP- and GTP-bound forms are more representative of the small G protein natural activities. Studies with fast-cycling mutants underline the importance of the GTPase cycle and indicate that the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 3The abbreviations used are: GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins; MHCI, major histocompatibility complex class I; BHK, baby hamster kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild-type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor. 3The abbreviations used are: GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins; MHCI, major histocompatibility complex class I; BHK, baby hamster kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild-type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor. cannot be considered as mere terminators, but rather as essential effectors (5Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Frech M. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17700-17706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In fact, there has been recent accumulating evidence of molecular functions and signaling pathways controlled by GAPs for Ras and Rho (10Tocque B. Delumeau I. Parker F. Maurier F. Multon M.C. Schweighoffer F. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This is also the case for the Arf GAPs, which represent the largest group of Arf-GTP-binding partners identified to date. Over 15 different Arf GAPs found in the human genome have been classified into two groups: Arf GAP1 and AZAP (Arf GAP with ankyrin repeats and pleckstrin homology domains) (12Randazzo P.A. Hirsch D.S. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Arf GAP1 proteins comprise Arf GAP1/3, the Git proteins, and additional proteins that contain an Arf GAP-like domain. The AZAP subgroup is further subdivided into four groups: ASAPs containing SH3 domains, ACAPs with predicted coiled-coil domains, AGAPs with GTP-binding protein-like domains, and ARAPs containing Rho GAP domains. The specificity of these enzymes has yet to be conclusively solved and, more important, established in vivo. Arf6 seems to be the target of several Arf GAPs, including ACAP1 and ACAP2, Git1 and Git2, or ASAP1 and ASAP2 (12Randazzo P.A. Hirsch D.S. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The fact that more Arf GAPs than Arf proteins exist make them likely candidates as effectors. Furthermore, their multidomain organization argues in favor of their acting as scaffolding molecules capable of transducing the signal of an activated Arf protein toward one or several biological functions. For instance, they might facilitate the concerted rearrangement of the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton required for cell migration and phagocytosis downstream of Arf6 activation. Arf6-regulated cellular functions are classically approached by using dominant-negative (Arf6(T27N)) and constitutively active (Arf6(Q67L)) mutants. In many cases, both mutants exhibit a similar phenotype, suggesting that the blocking of the GDP/GTP cycle affects Arf6 biological effects (13D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D.

In fact, a fast-cycling mutant of Arf6 (Arf6(T157A)) was used to show that the Arf6 GDP/GTP cycle might be important for Arf6 effects on actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration (19Santy L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40185-40188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the role of the Arf6 GAPs in Arf6-mediated cortical actin cytoskeleton remodeling and studied the importance of the completion of the full GDP/GTP cycle of Arf6 for the post-endocytic transport of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI). Collectively, our data support a model whereby Arf6 conducts its biological functions by cycling through its GDP- and GTP-bound forms and suggest an important role for the Arf6 GAPs. We also contribute new evidence for a plasma membrane receptor for Arf6. Altogether, our results provide new insights into Arf6 mechanisms of action. Cell Culture and Antibodies—Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were grown in BHK-21 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.

Production and Purification of Recombinant Arf Proteins—For production of myristoylated Arf1 and Arf6 proteins, BL21(DE3) bacteria were cotransformed with pET21b-Arf and pBB131, encoding yeast N-myristoyltransferase (21Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Recombinant myristoylated Arf6 with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was separated from the contaminating non-myristoylated protein by precipitation in 35% saturated ammonium sulfate, followed by adsorption to His·Bind resin (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose; Qiagen Inc.) and elution with 200 mm imidazole (pH 8) in 10% glycerol. After gel filtration on NAP-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences), the proteins were stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μm GTP or GDP. Myr-Arf1 was purified as described previously (22Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Biochemical Properties of Recombinant Arf6 Proteins—The N-myristoylated and C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged wild-type (WT) Arf6, Arf6(T157N), Arf6(Q37E/S38I), and Arf6(Q37E/S38I/T157N) proteins purified from bacteria were loaded with GDP or GTP in solution. After ultracentrifugation, all of the proteins were found to be stable, as >80% were recovered in the supernatant. The stability of the association with the nucleotide was also assessed as described (23Macia E. Luton F. Partisani M. Cherfils J. Chardin P. Franco M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, >80% of the proteins had kept their nucleotide. Finally, we tested whether the introduction of the mutations affected Arf6 interaction with the membrane. Sedimentation experiments with azolectin vesicles established that all mutants were capable of switching from a GDP-bound soluble form to a GTP-bound membrane-associated form. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the Arf6 mutants are stable GTP- or GDP-bound proteins, that the myristate and N-terminal helix are properly exposed for interacting with the lipids, and that the introduction of the C-terminal hexahistidine tag did not affect the interaction of Arf6 with the membrane. Unlabeled nucleotides and azolectin were from Sigma. Preparation of Phospholipid Vesicles—Except for experiments with PZA, large unilamellar vesicles from crude soybean lipids (type IIS azolectin) were prepared as described (24Szoka Jr., F. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). For in vitro studies with PZA, sucrose-loaded liposomes of defined composition were prepared by extrusion through a 0.4-μm pore polycarbonate filter (Isopore™, Millipore Corp., Molsheim, France) (25Macia E. Paris S. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The composition was 50% egg phosphatidylcholine, 19% liver phosphatidylethanolamine, 5% brain phosphatidylserine, 7.5% liver phosphatidylinositol, 16% cholesterol, and 2.5% phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2). Lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). GDP or GTPγS Dissociation Assay—Myr-Arf6-His proteins (2 μm) were first loaded with [3H]GDP for 30 min at 30 °C or with [35S]GTPγS for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer containing either 40 μm [3H]GDP (1000 cpm/pmol; Amersham Biosciences) and 70 μm free Mg2+ or 20 μm [35S]GTPγS (1000 cpm pmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1 μm free Mg2+. When maximal loading was reached, the free Mg2+ concentration was raised to 1.5 mm ([3H]GDP) or 1 mm ([35S]GTPγS) to stabilize the nucleotide. Spontaneous nucleotide dissociation was initiated by the addition of 1 mm unlabeled GDP or GTPγS, and exchange was catalyzed by the addition of EFA6 (20 and 100 nm) and 1 mm unlabeled GTP. After various incubation times, protein and bound nucleotide were isolated by filtration through nitrocellulose filters and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Sedimentation Assay—Myr-Arf6-His proteins (3 μm) were loaded with GDP with and without AlFx (10 mm NaF and 100 μm AlCl3) for 20 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of PIP2-enriched liposomes (2 mg/ml) prepared as described above. Where indicated, PZA or the Arf-GTP-binding domain of ARHGAP10 (2 μm) was added and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. Liposomes were then separated by ultracentrifugation, and the amount of proteins bound to liposomes was quantified by SDS-PAGE, SYPRO orange (Bio-Rad) staining, and densitometric analysis (Fujifilm LAS-3000 fluorescence imaging system). Fluorescence Measurements—Tryptophan fluorescence was used to follow Arf conformational change upon GTP hydrolysis. Two tryptophans act as intrinsic probes of the conformation of Arf1 or Arf6. Upon GTP hydrolysis, these two aromatic groups move closer to each other, inducing a decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of Arf (26Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All fluorescence measurements were performed with a Shimadzu RF-5000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. GTP-loaded myristoylated Arf1 or Arf6 proteins (0.5 μm) were injected into a fluorescence cuvette containing liposomes of defined composition (0.2 mg/ml, 0.4 μm) in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. GTP hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of 10 nm ACAP1 or PZA. PZA is a fragment of the Arf GAP ASAP1 that includes a pleckstrin homology domain (which binds PIP2), a zinc finger GAP domain (homologous to the catalytic domain of Arf GAP1), and ankyrin repeats (27Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The decrease in fluorescence could be fit to a single exponential. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 297.5 and 340 nm, respectively. An emission bandwidth of 5 nm and small excitation bandwidth of 3 nm were used to maximize the signal/noise ratio. Pull-down Assay for Arf6-GTP—The activation levels of expressed Arf6 proteins were assayed as described previously (28Niedergang F. Colucci-Guyon E. Dubois T. Raposo G. Chavrier P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Dubois T. Paleotti O. Mironov A.A. Fraisier V. Stradal T.E. De Matteis M.A. Franco M. Chavrier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, BHK cells were lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% sodium cholate, 0.005% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min and incubated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 40 μg of GST-ARHGAP10 Arf-binding domain bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 40 min. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer. The presence of Arf6-GTP was detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. Triton X-100 Solubilization and Immunoblotting—BHK cells (10 × 106) were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated Arf6 proteins. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. Aliquots of the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody to detect the Arf6 proteins. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For morphological studies, the cells were exposed to 30 mm NaF and 50 μm AlCl3 for 30 min at 37 °C where indicated. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (30Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Goud B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For the endocytosis assay, anti-MHCI antibody (10 μg/ml) was prebound to the cell surface at 4 °C for 1 h. The unbound excess was eliminated by three quick washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were then incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to allow for endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of the anti-MHCI antibody. For recycling, the cells were treated as described above; but after 6 h of internalization at 37 °C, the samples were cooled down, and the anti-MHCI antibody present on the cell surface was stripped by a 2-min acid wash at 4 °C with 150 mm NaCl and 100 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.6). After one quick wash with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C to allow for recycling of internalized anti-MHCI antibody. At the end of the incubation period, the samples were treated as described above for immunofluorescence analysis. For both endocytosis and recycling assays, the transfected cells expressing exogenous Arf6 were detected with anti-HA antibody 3F10. Confocal microscopy analysis was carried out using a Leica TCS-SP microscope equipped with a mixed-gas argon/krypton laser. Co-immunoprecipitation—The experiment was performed exactly as described previously (31Klein S. Franco M. Chardin P. Luton F. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5741-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using FuGENE 6. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were exposed or not to AlFx (10 mm NaF and 100 μm AlCl3) for 30 min at 37 °C and solubilized in Triton X-100 buffer containing 0.5 mm 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (Perbio Science France SAS, Brebières, France). Lysates were centrifuged, precleared, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG antibody-agarose beads (Sigma). The washed immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the indicated proteins were detected after immunoblotting by chemiluminescence (ECL™, Amersham Biosciences) and revealed using the Fujifilm LAS-3000 fluorescence imaging system. Biotinylation Recycling Assay—HeLa cells grown on 35-mm dishes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and cell surface-biotinylated in PBS containing 1 mg/ml succinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate. The cells were then washed, and the biotin was quenched by three quick washes with minimum Eagle's medium/bovine serum albumin (minimum Eagle's medium, 0.6% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and penicillin/streptomycin) supplemented with 50 mm NH4Cl. The cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in minimum Eagle's medium/bovine serum albumin to allow for cell-surface receptor endocytosis, followed by three washes with ice-cold PBS. Except for control samples, cells were treated with 50 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (pH 8.6) for 45 min at 4 °C to remove the remaining biotin from the cell surface. The cells were then incubated for different periods of time at 37 °C to allow for cell-surface recycling of pre-internalized biotinylated membrane receptors. The cells were submitted to glutathione treatment to remove the biotin from recycled pre-internalized biotinylated cell-surface receptors. The cells were then solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 125 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors for 20 min at 4 °C and spun at 15,000 × g for 30 min in a microcentrifuge; the supernatant was precleared on Sepharose beads; and the biotinylated proteins were recovered after a 60-min incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads. The bound proteins were eluted by vortexing the beads for 10 min at 60 °C in an equal volume of 100 mm dithiothreitol and prepared for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using anti-MHCI antibody HC10. The controls included a sample for total biotinylation processed for immunoprecipitation immediately after the biotinylation step and a sample to test for the efficiency of the glutathione treatment immediately after biotinylation. The proteins were revealed by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Quantitation was performed using the Fujifilm LAS-3000 fluorescence imaging system. In this study, we analyzed a series of Arf6 mutants in vivo and in vitro. To allow for easy comparison, all of the mutants were analyzed side by side, and the results are presented in the same figures. Role of the Arf6 GDP/GTP Cycle—To address the importance of the Arf6 nucleotide cycle, we designed a new fast-cycling mutant that would cycle more rapidly than Arf6WT between its GDP- and GTP-bound states. Similar to Phe28 of Ras, Thr157 interacts with the guanine base, and its mutation was predicted to affect the affinity of both nucleotides (32Menetrey J. Macia E. Pasqualato S. Franco M. Cherfils J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In a previous study (19Santy L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40185-40188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Thr157 was replaced with alanine (Arf6(T157A)) to eliminate the van der Waals interactions existing between the threonine and guanine base. Here, we replaced Thr157 with the large positively charged amino acid asparagine to maximally interfere with the binding of the nucleotide. Essential to the characterization of a fast-cycling mutant is the determination of the spontaneous GDP dissociation rate, which should be increased. We measured the GDP dissociation rate of Arf6(T157N) in the presence of lipids at physiological Mg2+ concentration by monitoring the dissociation of prebound [3H]GDP over time. An internal experimental control included Arf1WT, which is known to have a lower GDP off-rate compared with Arf6WT (32Menetrey J. Macia E. Pasqualato S. Franco M. Cherfils J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We observed that the T157N mutation increased the GDP off-rate by nearly 5-fold compared with Arf6WT (Fig. 1, A, • (Arf6WT) and ▪ (Arf6(T157N)); and B). The GTP off-rate was also determined by following the dissociation of prebound [35S]GTPγS. The experiment was controlled using Arf6WT samples incubated in low magnesium-containing medium or in the presence of the exchange factor EFA6 (Fig. 1C). The GTPγS off-rate of Arf6(T157N) was found to be similar to that of Arf6WT. However, because the reaction was very slow, a slight difference could not be totally excluded. Next, we tested the sensitivity of Arf6(T157N) to an Arf6-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and GAP regulatory factors. The sensitivity of Arf6(T157N) to the Arf6-specific exchange factor EFA6 was tested by following the exchange of preloaded [3H]GDP for nonradioactive GTP over time (Fig. 2A). We found that the mutant was sensitive to EFA6 to the same extent as Arf6WT, with a 10-fold stimulation over the spontaneous exchange rate at 100 nm EFA6 (Fig. 2B). We then tested the sensitivity of Arf6(T157N) to the Arf6 GAP ACAP1 (33Jackson T.R. Brown F.D. Nie Z. Miura K. Foroni L. Sun J. Hsu V.W. Donaldson J.G. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Tryptophan fluorescence was used to follow Arf6 conformational change upon GTP hydrolysis, which was monitored by a decrease in fluorescence (Fig. 2C). Arf proteins have been shown to have very low intrinsic GTPase activity (26Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we found that the T157N mutation did not increase the spontaneous GTPase activity of Arf6 (Fig. 2C, see curve before the addition of the GAP indicated by the arrow). The mutation of Thr157 did not affect sensitivity to ACAP1, as Arf6(T157N) and Arf6WT displayed the same rate of catalyzed GTP hydrolysis (∼0.04 min–1) (Fig. 2, C and D). As a negative control for the GAP reaction, we showed that Arf6(Q67L) was completely insensitive to ACAP1. ASAP1, another Arf GAP that is more specific toward Arf1 in vitro (34Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) but has been shown to affect Arf6 functions in vivo (35Hashimoto S. Hashimoto A. Yamada A. Kojima C. Yamamoto H. Tsutsumi T. Higashi M. Mizoguchi A. Yagi R. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37677-37684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was also tested and gave similar results (Fig. 2, E and F). Decreasing the affinity for the nucleotides has been shown to affect the stability of Arf6 (23Macia E. Luton F. Partisani M. Cherfils J. Chardin P. Franco M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, before analyzing the effects of the mutant in vivo, its stability was assessed by Triton X-100 extraction. As described previously (23Macia E. Luton F. Partisani M. Cherfils J. Chardin P. Franco M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the Arf6WT and Arf6(Q67L) proteins were found in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction, whereas the unstable aggregated Arf6(T27N) mutant was found in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 3A). The Arf6(T157N) mutant was also found in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction, suggesting that it is stable when expressed in vivo. In cytosol/membrane fractionation, Arf6(T157N) was recovered"

Quality control of CFTR is strictly regulated by several molecular chaperones. Here we show that calreticulin (CRT), which is a lectin-like chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), negatively regulates the cell surface CFTR. RNA interference-based CRT knockdown induced the increase of CFTR expression. Consistently, this effect was observed in vivo. CRT heterozygous (CRT+/-) mice had a higher endogenous expression of CFTR than the wild-type mice. Moreover, CRT overexpression induced cell surface expression of CRT, and it significantly decreased the cell surface expression and function of CFTR. CRT overexpression destabilized the cell surface CFTR by enhancing endocytosis, leading to proteasomal degradation. Deletion of the carboxyl domain of CRT, which results in its ER export, increased the negative effect and enhanced the interaction with CFTR. Thus, CRT in the post-ER compartments may act as a negative regulator of the cell surface CFTR.

Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to the absence or malfunction of a regulated Cl- channel in the apical membrane of secretory epithelia resulting in the clinical symptoms of cystic fibrosis, which is the most common lethal genetic disease in Caucasians (5Riordan J.R.

After translation, CFTR is folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) assisted by several chaperone proteins, but only ∼30% of the immature CFTR is exported from the ER to the Golgi and converted to the mature form by oligosaccharide processing (6Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Ultimately, mature CFTR reaches the plasma membrane where it functions as a regulated Cl- channel (6Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, ∼70% of immature CFTR is retained in the ER by the ER quality control system (6Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N.

CNX interacts with immature CFTR via monoglucosylated oligosaccharide to attenuate the ERAD, resulting in the stimulation of CFTR folding (7Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol.

Similar to CNX, CRT interacts with glycoproteins containing monoglucosylated oligosaccharides and functions in their ER retention (22Popescu C.I. Paduraru C. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. J. Biol.

However, there are some functional differences between CRT and CNX (23Molinari M. Eriksson K.K. Calanca V. Galli C. Cresswell P. Michalak M. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In contrast to CNX, CRT has multiple functions (17Michalak M. Corbett E.F. Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Opas M.

Some CRT is expressed at the cell surface and in the extracellular environment, although it is most abundantly expressed in the ER (19Johnson S. Michalak M. Opas M. Eggleton P.

Florin I. Okada T. Pollesello P. Bergman T. Thelestam M. Mori K. Alape-Giron A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21724-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which induce conformational change of CRT leading to enhanced interaction with its substrates (25Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, CRT may have a role distinct from CNX in the quality control of CFTR, although the role of CRT in the quality control of CFTR remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of CRT in the quality control of CFTR. CRT knockdown increased CFTR expression, whereas CRT overexpression decreased the cell surface CFTR expression. CRT overexpression enhanced the internalization of cell surface CFTR and directed it to proteasomal degradation. These results demonstrate that CRT negatively regulates the cell surface CFTR. Materials—The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse monoclonal anti-CFTR (C terminus-specific) (clone 24-1, Genzyme/Techne, Cambridge, MA), anti-rabbit anti-CFTR (H182) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-rabbit anti-calnexin (anti-CNX, C terminus-specific; SPA-860, Stressgen Biotechnologies, Inc. San Diego, CA), rat monoclonal anti-Hsc70 (SPA-815, Stressgen), rabbit anti-calreticulin (anti-CRT; SPA-600, Stressgen), mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and rabbit anti-Myc (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) antibodies. MG-132 was purchased from Calbiochem, and digitonin, lactacystin, brefeldin A, bafilomycin A1, forskolin, chlorophenylthio-cAMP, and cycloheximide were from Sigma. DNA Constructs and Recombinant Adenovirus—Several CRT mutants tagged with c-Myc in the C terminus were constructed in pCMV-Tag5 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with standard methods and verified by sequencing. In the case of full-length CRT, c-Myc tag was fused before the KDEL ER retrieval signal. cDNA encoding the full-length calreticulin with signal sequence and C-terminal KDEL ER retrieval signal (amino acid residues 1-417) was synthesized by PCR-driven reaction using CRTΔKDEL as template and the following oligodeoxynucleotides with XhoI (primer 5′-XhoI-Myc+KDEL+S and 3′-XhoI-Myc+KDEL+S) restriction sites: 5′XhoI-Myc+KDEL+S, 5-TCGAGCAGAAACTCATCTCTGAAGAGGATCTGAAGGACGAGCTGTAGC-3 and 3′XhoI-Myc+KDEL+S, 5-TCGAGCTACAGCTCGTCCTTCAGATCCTCTTCAGAGATGAGTTTCTGC-3. cDNA encoding the deletion of the KDEL sequence of the protein (amino acid residues 1-413) was synthesized by PCR-driven reaction using the following CRT5′-HindIII and CRT1239-XhoI primers with 5′-flanking HindIII and XhoI, respectively: CRT5′-HindIII, 5′-CCCAAG CTTATGCTGCTATCCGTGC-3′, CRT1239-XhoI, 5′-CTACAGCTCCTCGAG GGCCTGG-3′. cDNA encoding the deletion of the KDEL sequence and the C-domain of the protein (amino acid residues 1-307) was synthesized by PCR-driven reaction using the following CRT5′-HindIII and CRT921-XhoI primers with 5′-flanking HindIII and XhoI, respectively: CRT921-XhoI, 5-CGCCAAAG TTCTCGAGGGCATAGATACT-3. Recombinant human CRT (Ad-CRT), calnexin (Ad-CNX), or LacZ (Ad-LacZ) based on adenovirus 5 (Ad5) was produced as described previously (16Okiyoneda T. Harada K. Takeya M. Yamahira K. Wada I. Shuto T.

Transfection and adenovirus infection were performed as described previously (16Okiyoneda T. Harada K. Takeya M. Yamahira K. Wada I. Shuto T. Suico M.A. Hashimoto Y. Kai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 1 mm (CFTR- and ΔF508-BHK cells) or 2 mm sodium butyrate (CFTR- and ΔF508-CHO cells) for 20-24 h before analysis. siRNA Preparation and Transfection—CRT-siRNA was designed as described previously (29Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar). We used the 21-nucleotide sense strand (CAUGAGCAGAACAUCGACUdTdT) and the 21-nucleotide antisense strand (AGUCGAUGUUCUGCUCAUGdTdT) of CRT mRNA (GenBank™ accession number M84739). siRNA duplex was prepared as described previously (29Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar). Transient transfection with siRNA was performed using TransIT-TKO (Mirus, Madison, WI) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Western Blotting—Western blotting experiments were performed as described previously (16Okiyoneda T. Harada K. Takeya M. Yamahira K. Wada I. Shuto T. Suico M.A. Hashimoto Y. Kai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Detection of Endogenous CFTR Protein in CRT Heterozygous (CRT+/-) Mice—CRT+/- mice were obtained from M. Michalak (30Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). After rapid excision, kidneys from a CRT+/- mouse were homogenated in homogenate buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)) containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged at 800 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was suspended in resuspension buffer (12 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min. Furthermore, supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 40,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet (microsome fraction) was immediately solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was analyzed by Western blot as described above. Cell Surface Biotinylation—CFTR-CHO cells were biotinylated in 1 mg/ml EZ-Link™ sulfo-NHS-SS biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min and solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (lysate) after washing three times with PBS. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by incubation with ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 4 h. After washing four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, biotinylated proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer (cell surface). Cell lysates (40 μg) and biotinylated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Endocytic Assay—Cell surface CFTR was biotinylated at 4 °C for 30 min as described above. Internalization of biotinylated CFTR was initiated by addiing prewarmed (37 °C) culture medium and then transferring the dishes to 37 °C followed, after the chase period (3-30 min), by arrest of internalization with ice-cold PBS. Biotin molecules remaining at the cell surface were stripped by reducing their disulfide bonds with the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA). Cells were treated with stripping buffer (50 mm MESNA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.6), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2) for 45 min (three times for 15 min) at 4 °C. Biotinylated CFTR was isolated as described above and analyzed by Western blotting. Pulse-Chase Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Pulse-chase analysis and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously (16Okiyoneda T. Harada K. Takeya M. Yamahira K. Wada I. Shuto T. Suico M.A. Hashimoto Y. Kai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To detect weak interaction, cells were lysed in 0.5% digitonin buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% digitonin) containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture, and the cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitants were washed with 0.1% digitonin buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% digitonin) four times, eluted, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cross-linking—Proteins were cross-linked with DTSSP (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing three times with PBS, CFTR-CHO cells were incubated in PBS containing 100 μg/ml DTSSP, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 50 mm and by incubation on ice for 5 min. After washing, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. The cross-linked proteins were dissociated by SDS-sample buffer containing a reducing agent prior to loading on SDS-PAGE. Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemical analyses were performed as described previously (16Okiyoneda T. Harada K. Takeya M. Yamahira K. Wada I. Shuto T. Suico M.A. Hashimoto Y. Kai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 125I Efflux Experiments—125I efflux experiments were performed as described previously (31Okiyoneda T. Wada I. Jono H. Shuto T. Yoshitake K. Nakano N. Nagayama S. Harada K. Isohama Y. Miyata T. Kai H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The percentage efflux was calculated as follows: % efflux (E) = (count secreted)/(total count remaining in the cells each minutes) × 100. Data are expressed as mean values ± S.D. (n = 3). Data were evaluated for statistical differences by analysis of t test with Microsoft Excel. CRT Knockdown Increases CFTR Expression—To investigate the role of CRT in the quality control of CFTR, we examined the effect of CRT knockdown on the expression of CFTR. Western blotting analysis showed that siRNA for CRT (CRT-siRNA) specifically decreased endogenous CRT expression by ∼60% reduction but did not affect the expression of calnexin (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, RNAi-based CRT knockdown significantly increased CFTR expression by ∼1.6-fold (Fig. 1A, WT), although it did not affect ΔF508 CFTR expression (Fig. 1A, ΔF). Moreover, we also determined that CRT knockdown increases the CFTR expression in vivo. Because CRT knock-out mice (CRT-/-) are embryonically lethal (30Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), we utilized CRT heterozygous mice (CRT+/-) (30Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results in RNAi-based knockdown, endogenous CFTR expression in CRT heterozygous mice (CRT+/-) was significantly higher than in wild-type mouse (CRT+/+) (Fig. 1, B and C). In CRT+/- mice, in which there was a ∼35% reduction of endogenous CRT expression, we detected an ∼1.4-fold increase of endogenous CFTR compared with that in CRT+/+ mice (Fig. 1, B and C). CRT Overexpression Decreases Expression and Function of CFTR—To confirm whether CRT negatively regulates the CFTR expression, we examined the effect of CRT overexpression on the steady state level of CFTR. Western blotting analysis showed that the recombinant adenovirus expressing CRT (Ad-CRT) significantly increased CRT expression in an m.o.i.-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 3-5). At an m.o.i. of 100, an ∼2.2-fold induction of CRT was observed (Fig. 2A, lane 4). There was no morphological change of the cells even if cells were infected with Ad-CRT at an m.o.i. of 800 (data not shown). As expected, CRT overexpression significantly decreased CFTR expression, especially the mature form (band C), in a m.o.i.-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 3-5). It is unlikely that decreased CFTR expression resulted from the cytotoxicity of adenovirus, because control adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) did not affect the CFTR expression (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7), similar to our previous report (16Okiyoneda T. Harada K. Takeya M. Yamahira K. Wada I. Shuto T. Suico M.A. Hashimoto Y. Kai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast to the result in wild-type CFTR, CRT overexpression did not affect the expression of ΔF508 CFTR, which is the most common mutant of CFTR retained in the ER (Fig. 2A). The negative effect of CRT on CFTR expression seems to be CFTR-specific, because CRT overexpression did not affect the expression of a viral transmembrane protein, VSV-G (Fig. 2B). Cell surface biotinylation analysis revealed that CRT overexpression decreased cell surface expression of CFTR (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, cell surface expression of CRT was observed upon CRT overexpression (Fig. 2C). This result was supported by immunocytochemical analysis using BHK cells stably expressing GFP-CFTR (CFTR-BHK cells, Fig. 2, D and E). Fig. 2, D and E, shows that the fluorescence intensity of GFP-CFTR at the plasma membrane was significantly decreased by CRT overexpression and that there was an inverse correlation in fluorescence intensity between CFTR and CRT (Fig. 2, D and E, +Ad-CRT, arrowhead). Furthermore, we examined the effects of CRT overexpression on the endogenous CFTR in normal human airway epithelial cells (16HBE14o- cell). Because it was very difficult to detect the cell surface expression of endogenous CFTR by Western blotting analysis, we measured cAMP-activated halide efflux as a functional marker of CFTR (31Okiyoneda T. Wada I. Jono H. Shuto T. Yoshitake K. Nakano N. Nagayama S. Harada K. Isohama Y. Miyata T. Kai H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In control cells, cAMP-induced 125I efflux was observed, indicating that CFTR was activated (Fig. 2F). In the cells infected with Ad-CRT, cAMP-induced 125I efflux was significantly inhibited, although Ad-LacZ did not affect cAMP-induced 125I efflux (Fig. 2F). These results demonstrate that CRT overexpression decreases the cell surface expression and function of CFTR. CRT Overexpression Destabilizes the Mature CFTR—Next, we tried to determine the mechanism by which CRT negatively regulates CFTR expression. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that CRT overexpression did not affect the mRNA level of CFTR (data not shown). Because CRT overexpression decreased the mature CFTR, but not ΔF508 CFTR, CRT overexpression could inhibit the maturation of CFTR. To clarify this possibility, we did pulse-chase analysis. In controls, ∼ 40% of immature CFTR was converted to the mature form (band C) after a 3-h chase (Fig. 3, A and B, uninfected). Upon CRT overexpression, ∼ 40% of the immature CFTR was also converted to the mature form after a 3-h chase (Fig. 3, A and B, +Ad-CRT), indicating that CRT overexpression did not inhibit the maturation of CFTR. This result was supported by immunocytochemical analyses showing that CRT overexpression did not affect the ER-Golgi transport of CFTR (Fig. 3C). Because CRT overexpression did not affect the maturation of CFTR, it is possible that CRT overexpression may destabilize the mature CFTR. Pulse-chase analysis showed that in controls, the half-life of mature CFTR was ∼20 h (Fig. 3, D and E, uninfected), the same as in previous reports (6Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the half-life of mature CFTR upon CRT overexpression was ∼10 h (Fig. 3, D and E, +Ad-CRT), indicating that CRT overexpression destabilized mature CFTR resulting in the decrease of CFTR expression. CRT Overexpression Enhances the Internalization of Cell Surface CFTR—Previous reports showed that the amount of cell surface CFTR is regulated by the endocytosis pathway (32Bradbury N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 33Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3655-3660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Sharma M. Pampinella F. Nemes C. Benharouga M. So J. Du K. Bache K.G. Papsin B. Zerangue N. Stenmark H. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 35Gentzsch M. Chang X.B. Cui L. Wu Y. Ozols V.V. Choudhury A. Pagano R.E. Riordan J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2684-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the destabilization of mature CFTR by CRT overexpression resulted from enhanced endocytosis of cell surface CFTR. To clarify this possibility, we performed an endocytic assay using cell surface biotinylation by NHS-SS-biotin, a cleavable derivative of NHS-biotin (36Lukacs G.L. Segal G. Kartner N. Grinstein S. Zhang F. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Following cell surface biotinylation at 4 °C, the temperature of the medium was shifted to 37 °C for a period of 3-30 min to allow internalization of cell surface CFTR. Biotin molecules remaining at the cell surface were stripped with the membrane-impermeable reducing agent MESNA (36Lukacs G.L. Segal G. Kartner N. Grinstein S. Zhang F. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Immediately after cell surface biotinylation (0 min), biotinylated CFTR was not detected after stripping (Fig. 4A). However, after incubation at 37 °C, biotinylated CFTR was detected after stripping, indicating that cell surface CFTR was internalized (Fig. 4A). Quantification analysis showed that, similar to a previous report (36Lukacs G.L. Segal G. Kartner N. Grinstein S. Zhang F. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), ∼20% of cell surface CFTR was internalized within 6 min followed by a gradual loss of internalized CFTR (Fig. 4, A and B, control), a result of recycling back to the plasma membrane (34Sharma M. Pampinella F. Nemes C. Benharouga M. So J. Du K. Bache K.G. Papsin B. Zerangue N. Stenmark H. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 35Gentzsch M. Chang X.B. Cui L. Wu Y. Ozols V.V. Choudhury A. Pagano R.E. Riordan J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2684-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Upon CRT overexpression, ∼30% of cell surface CFTR was internalized within 6 min (Fig. 4, A and B, +Ad-CRT), indicating that CRT overexpression enhances the internalization of cell surface CFTR. Moreover, after 6 min, internalized CFTR was increased, and ∼42% of cell surface CFTR was internalized after 30 min, indicating that CRT overexpression might also inhibit the recycling of internalized CFTR. To clarify the possibility that CRT overexpression also inhibits endocytic recycling, we utilized a vacuolar ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which inhibits the transport of vesicles out of the early endosome (37Thomsen P. Rudenko O. Berezin V. Norrild B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After BafA1 treatment (at 1 μm for 3 h), CFTR was accumulated in the juxtanuclear region where an early endosome marker EEA1 was co-localized (Fig. 4C). After BafA1 washout, CFTR accumulated in early endosome was rapidly moved and recycled back to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4D, control; supplemental Movie 1). However, in CRT-overexpressing cells, CFTR accumulated in the early endosome was immobilized (Fig. 4D, +Ad-CRT; supplemental Movie 2), indicating that CRT overexpression may inhibit the recycling of CFTR. These results indicate that CRT overexpression enhances the endocytosis of CFTR and inhibits recycling back to the plasma membrane. CRT Overexpression Directs CFTR to Proteasomal Degradation—Our data showed that CRT overexpression enhances the endocytosis of cell surface CFTR and inhibits endocytic recycling to the plasma membrane. Thus, CRT may direct cell surface CFTR to lysosomal degradation, resulting in a decrease of CFTR expression. To clarify this possibility, we examined the effect of degradation inhibitors on the decrease of mature CFTR by CRT overexpression. Western blotting analysis showed that low concentration bafilomycin A1 treatment (200 nm, 24 h), which inhibits lysosomal degradation, did not block the decrease of mature CFTR induced by CRT overexpression (Fig. 5a, lane 5). However, proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin significantly blocked the negative effect of CRT (Fig. 5a, lanes 3 and 4). The same result was obtained from cell surface biotinylation analysis (Fig. 5b). These results indicate that CRT overexpression stimulates the proteasomal degradation of cell surface CFTR. CRT Negatively Regulates CFTR Expression at the Post-ER Compartment—To examine which regions of CRT are required for CRT to exert its negative effect on CFTR expression, we constructed several CRT deletion mutants tagged with c-Myc (Fig. 6A). Immmunocytochemical analysis of CFTR-BHK cells showed that deletion mutants of the ER retrieval signal (ΔKDEL) and the C terminus of CRT (ΔC) left the ER and localized in the Golgi (Fig. 6B; supplemental Fig. 1) similar to a previous report (38Sonnichsen B. Fullekrug J. Nguyen Van P. Diekmann W. Robinson D.G. Mieskes G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2705-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting in CFTR-CHO cells showed that the ER-exported mutants of CRT, especially CRTΔC, decreased CFTR expression more than full-length CRT (Fig. 6, C and D), indicating that the post-ER fraction of CRT exerts the negative effect. This result was supported by immunoprecipitation analysis; immunoprecipitation using anti-CFTR antibody revealed that CRTΔC interacted with CFTR (Fig. 6E, lane 8). There was a weak interaction between CFTR and CRT (Fig. 6E, lane 4), as detected by a cross-linker, DTSSP (Fig. 6F). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation using an anti-CRT antibody showed that CRT seems to interact preferentially with mature CFTR (Fig. 6G, band C). These results indicate that CRT interacts with mature CFTR and negatively regulates the CFTR expression at the post-ER compartment. In this study, we demonstrate that CRT negatively regulates the cell surface expression of CFTR. RNAi-based CRT knockdown significantly increased mature CFTR (Fig. 1A), and endogenous CFTR expression was also increased in CRT+/- mice (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, CRT seems to negatively regulate CFTR expression in vivo. This interpretation is supported by the results of overexpression experiments. CRT overexpression decreased the steady state level of CFTR, especially that of the mature form, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). CRT overexpression also decreased the cell surface expression and function of CFTR (Fig. 2, C and F). However, CRT overexpression did not affect ΔF508 CFTR expression (Fig. 2A), indicating that CRT could affect the CFTR expression at the post-ER level. The negative effect of CRT may be CFTR-specific, because CRT overexpression did not decrease the expression of VSV-G (Fig. 2B) and an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter, ABCG5/8. 4T. Okiyoneda, unpublished data. Our data clarified one of the mechanisms by which CRT negatively regulates the cell surface CFTR expression. Upon CRT overexpression, CRT expressed at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C) and interacted with mature CFTR (Fig. 6, F and G). Cell surface expression of CRT may result from the binding of secreted CRT to cell surface CFTR because CRT was secreted to the extracellular domain upon CRT overexpression. 5K. Harada, unpublished data. Although CRT overexpression did not inhibit maturation (Fig. 3A), it destabilized mature CFTR (Fig. 3, D and E). CRT overexpression stimulated the internalization of cell surface CFTR and inhibited recycling back to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). A defect in recycling in CRT-overexpressing cells might be predominant, because the effect of CRT overexpression was stronger from 6 to 30 min after internalization (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, CRT seems to stimulate the proteasomal degradation of mature CFTR (Fig. 5). The proteasomal degradation of mature CFTR in the post-Golgi compartment has been reported previously (39Benharouga M. Haardt M. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In regard to ΔF508 CFTR, we found that the function of cell surface ΔF508 CFTR rescued by incubation at 26 °C was enhanced by CRT knockdown. 5K. Harada, unpublished data. Moreover, it has been reported that cell surface ΔF508 CFTR is quickly internalized and degraded by proteasomes (35Gentzsch M. Chang X.B. Cui L. Wu Y. Ozols V.V. Choudhury A. Pagano R.E. Riordan J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2684-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 40Heda G.D. Tanwani M. Marino C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C166-C174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that CRT expression is up-regulated in cystic fibrosis cells (41Ribeiro C.M. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that although CRT overexpression did not affect the expression of ΔF508 CFTR localized in the ER (Fig. 2A), CRT may be involved in the instability of ΔF508 CFTR at the cell surface. Our interpretation that CRT negatively regulates CFTR expression at the post-ER level could be supported by the result that CRTΔC decreased the CFTR expression more than full-length CRT (Fig. 6, C and D). CRTΔC was exported from the ER (Fig. 6B; supplemental Fig. 1) and secreted to the extracellular domain (38Sonnichsen B. Fullekrug J. Nguyen Van P. Diekmann W. Robinson D.G. Mieskes G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2705-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRTΔC interacted with CFTR with higher affinity than full-length CRT; the interaction of CRT with CFTR was very weak (Fig. 6, E and F). It is unlikely that the enhanced affinity of CRTΔC was due simply to the inclusion of the two proteins into a misfolded aggregate, because the majority of CRTΔC appears to be in the native conformation and is functional for polypeptide binding (25Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, in our experiments, we detected CRTΔCin the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig. 6E), proving that this mutant, under the conditions observed, did not misfold. It is reasonable to conclude that the affinity of CRTΔC with CFTR is higher than that of full-length CRT because the C-domain of CRT prevents the interaction between CRT and its substrates (25Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Alternatively, because CRTΔC is secreted (38Sonnichsen B. Fullekrug J. Nguyen Van P. Diekmann W. Robinson D.G. Mieskes G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2705-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it may interact efficiently with mature CFTR at the cell surface. It has been known that CRT is an ER lectin-like chaperone protein, which selectively interacts with substrates having monoglucosylated oligosaccharides. In this study, we have shown that CRT interacts with mature CFTR, which has complex oligosaccharides. Because CRT cannot interact with complex oligosaccharides (42Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Soling H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), CRT could interact with mature CFTR via polypeptide-based interaction. This interpretation may be supported by our finding that deletion of the CRT-C domain, which prevents polypeptide-based interaction (25Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), enhanced the interaction with CFTR (Fig. 6E). Moreover, we found that a CRT mutant with no lectin activity, CRT(Y109F), decreased CFTR expression and that CRT interacted with CFTR under tunicamycin treatment, which inhibits the oligosaccharide addition in ER. 6K. Harada, T. Okiyoneda, Y. Hashimoto, K. Ueno, K. Nakamura, K. Yamahira, T. Sugahara, T. Shuto, I. Wada, M. A. Suico, and H. Kai, unpublished data. Therefore, the lectin function of CRT could not be involved in the negative regulation of CFTR. A previous study showed that stresses such as heat shock and Ca2+ depletion induce conformational change in CRT and enhance CRT interaction with its substrates (25Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that CRT overexpression stimulates the proteasomal degradation of SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase) under oxidative stress (43Ihara Y. Kageyama K. Kondo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although further investigations may be needed to clarify this hypothesis, it is likely that under a stress condition in which CRT is up-regulated (25Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Flores-Diaz M. Higuita J.C. Florin I. Okada T. Pollesello P. Bergman T. Thelestam M. Mori K. Alape-Giron A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21724-21731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), CRT may be expressed at the cell surface and interact with CFTR, which may stimulate the endocytosis of CFTR and direct it to proteasomal degradation. Recently (during the preparation of this manuscript), it was reported that oxidant stress suppresses CFTR expression (44Cantin A.M. Bilodeau G. Ouellet C. Liao J. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C262-C270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, CRT may enhance the degradation of CFTR by oxidant stress. We thank Dr. J. R.

Complete conversion of the ion charge selectivity in a set of receptor microchimeras indicates that the selectivity filter of the GluClβ receptor is created by a sequence connecting the first with the second transmembrane segments. A single substitution of a negatively charged residue within this sequence converted the selectivity of the GluClβ receptor's pore from anionic to cationic. Unexpectedly, elimination of the charge of each basic residue of the selectivity filter, one at a time or concomitantly, moderately reduced the PCl/PNa ratios, but the GluClβ receptor's mutants retained high capacity to select Cl- over Na+. These results indicate that, unlike the proposed case of anionic Gly- and γ-aminobutyric acid-gated ion channels, positively charged residues do not play the key role in the selection of ionic charge by the GluClβ receptor. Taken together with measurements of the effective open pore diameter and with structural modeling, the study presented here collectively indicates that in the most constricted part of the open GluClβ receptor's channel, Cl- interacts with backbone amides, where it undergoes partial dehydration necessary for traversing the pore.

This superfamily consists of cationic channels permeable to Na+, K+, and, in many subunit combinations, to Ca2+ ions, as well as of anionic channels selective to Cl- ions (reviewed by Keramidas et al. (9Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 161-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)). Structural similarities shared by Cys-loop receptors enabled swapping of pore sequences between cationic and anionic channels so as to assess the involvement of specific amino acids in ion charge selectivity. It was previously shown that concomitant replacement of the residues at positions -2′, -1′, and 13′ (Fig. 1, B and C) of cationic receptors by the residues found at the homologous positions of anionic receptors, and vice versa, lead to conversion of ion charge selectivity (10Galzi J.L.

Further mutagenesis studies led to the recognition that the different capacities of cationic versus anionic Cys-loop receptors to distinguish between the charge of ions rely on the differences in the amino acid composition at positions -1′ and -2′ (Fig. 1C) (13Menard C. Horvitz H.R. Cannon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27502-27507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Corringer P.J. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A.

The conserved pore-facing Glu residue at position -1′ of cationic Cys-loop receptors was further inferred to form, around the axis of ion conduction, a negatively charged ring that plays the key role in cationic selectivity by interacting with cations and repulsing anions (12Gunthorpe M.J. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10977-10983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Menard C. Horvitz H.R. Cannon S. J. Biol.

Conversely, a conserved arginine at position 0′ of anionic Cys-loop receptors was inferred to interact with anions and repulse cations. A basic residue at position 0′ is also typical of all cationic Cys-loop receptors (Fig. 1C and the ligand-gated ion channels data base), but it was suggested that local conformational differences in the M1-M2 connecting segment (M1-M2 loop) orient this basic residue to the pore lumen only in anionic Cys-loop receptors (9Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 161-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These local conformational differences have been attributed to a proline residue, which is present exclusively at position -2′ of anionic Cys-loop receptors (12Gunthorpe M.J. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10977-10983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Corringer P.J. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D.

Unlike all other homomeric anionic Cys-loop receptors studied thus far, the β subunit of the GluCl receptor does not have a proline residue at position -2′, a feature that minimizes the likelihood of causing drastic local conformational changes when mutating its M1-M2 loop. As the GluClβ subunit can assemble into a functional anionic homomeric receptor (GluClβR) (18Cully D.F. Vassilatis D.K. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Van der Ploeg L.H. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. Nature. 1994; 371: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), the selectivity filter of the GluClβR was readily identified here by microchimerism and then was extensively mutated. Electrophysiological analyses of ionic permeability ratios in a large repertoire of mutants, together with computer-assisted molecular modeling, reveal a novel mechanism of Cl- selection by a Cys-loop receptor. Chimeras and Mutants—The α7-GluClβ chimeric subunit was prepared as performed previously with the α7-5HT3AR (19Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), by fusing the N-terminal half of the chick α7 subunit (Fig. 1A, red segment) (Swiss-Prot accession number P22770) to the C-terminal half of the β subunit of the GluClR (Fig. 1A, non-red segments) (Swiss-Prot accession number Q17328). The entire sequence of the chimera is provided in Supplemental Fig. S1. Mutations were introduced as described previously (20Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells were transfected with the various chimeras together with a green fluorescent protein (cloned in a separate plasmid), using the calcium phosphate method. Electrophysiological recordings were made 2-3 days after the transfection, using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. To determine ionic permeability ratios, current-voltage relations were established in various external solutions with and without 100 μm ACh as follows. Solution A contained: 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm NaOH, pH 7.35. Solutions B1,2... are as solution A, but NaCl was diluted with a mannitol-containing solution to maintain equiosmolar conditions while reducing the external NaCl concentrations to (in mm): B1 = 70, B2 = 35, B3 = 17.5, B4 = 0. Note that in one exceptional case (chimera 4), the composition of the diluted solutions was slightly different, giving external NaCl concentrations of (in mm): B1′ = 100, B2′ = 40, B3′ = 20, B4′ = 10, B5 = 0. Solutions C1,2... are as solution A, but NaCl was replaced by sodium isethionate so as to keep the external concentration of Na+ ions constant and to replace Cl- ions by isethionate. The external concentrations of NaCl in these solutions was (in mm): C1 = 70, C2 = 35, C3 = 17.5, C4 = 0. Solution D is as solution A, but NaCl was replaced by 140 mm sodium acetate. Patch pipettes (1-2 megaohms) were filled with a solution containing 130 mm CsCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na2-ATP, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm CsOH, pH 7.35. External solutions were delivered by a computer-driven valve manifold system enabling fast exchange of the solutions. Current-voltage relations were determined at 25 °C by two methods. (i) Currents evoked by 100 μm ACh for 3 s were measured at different holding potentials ranging from -100 to +50 mV, and (ii) inverted 200-ms long voltage ramps (either from +50 to -100 mV or from +70 to -100 mV) were applied 1 and 2 s after the beginning of a 3-s ACh application. The initial holding potential was -60 mV. Leak currents obtained by the same protocol, in the absence of ACh, were subtracted. Measured reversal potential (Erev) values were corrected to account for the liquid junction potentials by using the JPCalc software (21Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) implemented in pClamp version 8.1. Permeability ratios for Na+, Cs+, and Cl- were calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, Erev=RTFln[Cl−]in+α[Na+]out+β[Cs+]out[Cl−]out+α[Na+]in+β[Cs+]in where R, T, and F are the gas constant, the absolute temperature, and the Faraday's constant, respectively, and the permeability ratios are α = PNa/PCl and β = PCs/PCl. Note that ion activities, instead of ion concentrations, have been used in the analyses of permeability ratios. Ionic activities were calculated on the basis of the Debye-Hückel theory (22MacInnes D.A. The Principles of Electrochemistry. Dover Publications, Inc., New York1961Google Scholar) but with the corrections introduced in the Millero-Pitzer method for solutions having an ionic strength greater than 0.1 m (41Pitzer K.S. Activity Coefficients in Electrolyte Solutions, 2nd Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 75-153Google Scholar), as implemented in the Electrolytes program of Aq-Solutions, a software package of programs for the quantitative treatment of equilibria in solution. 3For further information about this software package, please contact the author (Y. P.). Model Building—An initial homology model was built by using the atomic coordinates of the AChR structure (23Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) as a template (Protein Data Bank number 1OED), as recently described (20Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After modeling the M1-M2 loop, it was tilted together with the M1 and M2 segments to an intermediate position between the closed and open states previously elaborated by Paas et al. (20Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in the case of another Cys-loop chimeric receptor. We readily obtained an intermediate position displaying a distance of ∼6.1 Å between the van der Waals surfaces of backbone amides located on opposite sides of the pore, at the level of position -3′. This distance is within the range of the effective open pore diameter determined here. Note that the M1-M2 loop of the GluClβR (DLHSTAG) is shorter by two amino acids than the loop of the models elaborated in Paas et al. (20Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (PPDLHSTAG). As a result, when compared with its position in the chimera modeled in Paas et al. (20Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), histidine(H)-5′ of the GluClβR's pore (modeled here) moved away from the permeation pathway. Consequently, H-5′ of the GluClβR's model is not in contact with the permeating ions. This modeling observation is in line with the incapacity of Zn2+ to block the chimeric α7-GluClβR (data not shown), unlike the case of a chimera having the transmembrane segments of the 5HT3AR with the sequence PPDLHSTAG between M1 and M2 (20Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The root mean square difference between the backbone atoms of the GluClβR and chimera 17 is 0.03 Å (throughout the pentameric membrane-embedded domains). The root mean square difference between the backbone atoms of the M1-M2 loops (plus their flanking residues, I-10′ and R0′) of these structures is 0.08 Å. Chimeric Design and Current Amplitudes of the Various Mutants—As a first step, we generated a chimeric subunit where the extracellular segment of the AChR α7 subunit was fused to the GluClβ subunit segment that folds in the membrane and cytoplasm (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. S1). The α7-GluClβ chimeric subunit assembles into a homopentameric receptor (α7-GluClβR), like the case of all the mutants studied here. As such, the resulting α7-GluClβR responds to ACh but not to glutamate, allowing us to express our chimeric mutants in HEK-293 cells grown in serum-containing medium with no need of glutamate depletion. That is, this chimeric receptor carries the entire pore of the weakly desensitizing GluClβR (18Cully D.F. Vassilatis D.K. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Van der Ploeg L.H. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. Nature. 1994; 371: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) without being constitutively open (by glutamate present in the medium) and cytotoxic to the cells. Fig. 2A shows typical current traces of the chimeric α7-GluClβR measured at different membrane voltages. Then, based on previous studies carried out on a few vertebrate Cys-loop receptors, mutations were introduced in regions suspected to contribute to ion charge selectivity. This approach resulted in chimeric mutants that provided robust responses (Table 1).TABLE 1Permeability ratios (PX/PY) determined for the chimeric α7-GluClβR and its mutants Note that: (i) data are means ± S.E.; (ii) all values were rounded to the closest decimal number; (iii) pair sequence alignment between the α7 and the GluClβ receptors dictates the movement of the α7G-3′ (alignment in Fig. 1C) by one position downstream, i.e., it is G-2′ in Table I; (iv) gaps in the sequence are also numbered; (v) residues shown in blue do not appear in the native sequence of either the α7-AChR or the GluClβR; (vi) the entire sequence of the α7-GluClβ chimeric subunit is provided in the Supplemental Data (Fig. S1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)a Measured in response to 100 μm acetylcholine at -60mVb Number of cellsc Ion charge selectivity: A, anionic; C, cationicd The PCl/PCs ratio of chimeras 2 or 12 does not statistically differ from that of the α7-GluClβR (P = 0.059 and 0.150, respectively; tow-tailed, unpaired t test)e The PCl/PCs ratio of chimeras 13, 14 or 15 significantly differs from that of the α7-GluClβR (P = 0.0015, 0.0025, and 0.0009, respectively; two-tailed, unpaired t test)f NF, not functional Open table in a new tab a Measured in response to 100 μm acetylcholine at -60mV b Number of cells c Ion charge selectivity: A, anionic; C, cationic d The PCl/PCs ratio of chimeras 2 or 12 does not statistically differ from that of the α7-GluClβR (P = 0.059 and 0.150, respectively; tow-tailed, unpaired t test) e The PCl/PCs ratio of chimeras 13, 14 or 15 significantly differs from that of the α7-GluClβR (P = 0.0015, 0.0025, and 0.0009, respectively; two-tailed, unpaired t test) f NF, not functional Ion Charge Selectivity of the α7-GluClβR and Its Various Mutants—The I-V relations plotted for the α7-GluClβR show that omission of almost all external Cl- ions shifts the reversal potential (Erev) to a positive voltage (e.g. Fig. 2B), by 54.5 ± 1.2 mV (mean ± S.E. from 12 cells, after correcting with liquid junction potentials). The latter value is close to the maximal theoretical shift calculated based on the Cl- equilibrium (Nernst) potential (61.4 mV; calculated using ionic activities). The extent of the shift depended on the external concentrations of Cl- (Fig. 3A) and showed that the α7-GluClβR chimera is highly selective to Cl- relative to Na+ and Cs+ (PCl/PNa = ∼45 and PCl/PCs = 26; Table 1), as expected from a chimera harboring the pore of the GluClβR (18Cully D.F. Vassilatis D.K. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Van der Ploeg L.H. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. Nature. 1994; 371: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that a positively charged residue substituted at the extracellular mouth of Cys-loop receptor mutants (position 19′) partially contributes to ionic selectivity by attracting Cl- ions (24Thompson A.J. Lummis S.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or repulsing divalent cations (15Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It was also shown that an Arg19′ → Glu mutation in an anionic-to-cationic converted glycine receptor mutant contributes to cationic conductance (25Moorhouse A.J. Keramidas A. Zaykin A. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore replaced the segment 19′NAKL22′ of the GluClβR pore by the homologous segment of α7 (19′AEIM22′), and the resulting chimera retained Cl- selectivity, albeit with a lower PCl/PNa ratio, but with no change in the PCl/PCs ratio (chimera 1, Table 1 and Supplemental Fig. S2A). Cl- selectivity was also observed when the positive charge of the first amino acid of M2 (position 0′) was neutralized (chimera 2, Table 1 and Figs. 2C and 3A). Position -1′ is located in a constriction that extends from position 2′ toward the bottom of the pore (20Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P.

Consistently, it was previously shown that a substitution of Glu at position 2′ of the homomeric Glyα1R converted its selectivity (31Carland J.E. Moorhouse A.J. Barry P.H. Johnston G.A. Chebib M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54153-54160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, Glu substituted at positions -3′ or -4′ of the β subunit of a heteromeric GABAAα2β3γ2 receptor imparted permeability to cations along with anions (32Jensen M.L. Pedersen L.N. Timmermann D.B. Schousboe A. Ahring P.K. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 962-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, concomitant replacement of the M1-M2 loop and the residues at positions 0′ and 2′ of the GluClβR's pore by those of α7 resulted in a fully cationic channel (chimera 3, Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2B). Replacing only the M1-M2 loop also produced a fully cationic channel, indicating that a hydroxyl group at position 2′ does not play a role in ion charge selectivity (chimera 4, Table 1 and Figs. 2E and 3B). The latter conclusion well agrees with the observations that following non-polar substitutions at position 2′, the muscle AChR retains permeability to monovalent cations that are considered to interact with this position while traversing the pore (28Villarroel A. Sakmann B. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 196-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cationic selectivity was also observed when chimera 4 was further modified so as either to carry the M1-M2 sequence of the cationic 5HT3AR (chimera 5, Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2C) or to carry a neutral residue at position -7′ (chimera 6, Table 1, Fig. 3B, and supplemental Fig. S2D). The latter modification indicates that the so-called cytoplasmic ring (D-7′) does not play a role in ion charge selectivity. As long as a Glu residue occupied position -1′, further gradual changes in the sequence of the M1-M2 loop toward the sequence of the GluClβR (chimeras 7 and 8) did not convert the mutants back to anionic receptors, but they retained cationic selectivity, even when the GluClβR's pore was carrying a single G-1′E substitution (chimera 9) (Table 1, Figs. 2F and 3B, and supplemental Fig. S2E and S2F). It should, however, be noted that in three cases, a slight decrease in the relative permeability to Na+ (i.e. increase in PCl/PNa) was observed (chimeras 6, 7, and 9, Table 1). In contrast, integrating the residues of the M1-M2 loop of α7 within the sequence of the GluClβR's loop while keeping a Gly at position -1′ (i.e. the native amino acid of the GluClβR) provided an anionic channel (chimera 10, Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2G). Deleting the GluClβR residues at positions -6′ and -5′ (LH) slightly reduced the PCl/PNa and PCl/PCs ratios, but these mutants still displayed considerable capacity to select Cl- over Na+ and Cs+ (chimeras 11 and 12, Table 1, Fig. 3A, and supplemental Fig. S2H and S2I). Further deletion of the Thr that precedes position -2′ in the GluClβR, alone (chimera 13) or together with neutralization of the charge either at position -7′ (chimera 14) or at position 0′ (chimera 15), resulted in channels that retained high Cl- over Na+ selectivity but became slightly permeable to Cs+ (Table 1, Figs. 2D and 3A, and supplemental Fig. S2J and S2K). Shortening the M1-M2 loop to four amino acids rendered the chimeric receptor nonfunctional (chimera 16, Table 1). Proline at position -2 was shown to play a role in determining the (small) pore diameter of a glycine receptor, indicating that pore size also contributes to ion charge selectivity (Ref. 17Lee D.J. Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 351: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, reviewed by Keramidas et al. (9Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 161-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, an α7-GluClβR having a proline at position -2′ (chimera 17) displays PCl/PNa and PCl/PCs ratios closely similar to those of the α7-GluClβR (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S3). Relative Permeability of Chloride-selective Chimeras to Isethionate and Acetate—To assess the dimensions of the open pore of the α7-GluClβR and anionic mutants, we examined the permeability to the organic anions isethionate and acetate relatively to the permeability for Cl-. Table 2 shows that the α7-GluClβR is not permeable to isethionate but allows acetate to permeate slightly. Elimination of the side chain at position 0′ (chimera 2) or deleting residues belonging to the M1-M2 loop of the GluClβR (chimeras 12-15) turned these mutants permeable to isethionate and increased the relative permeability to acetate (Table 2). The increase in the relative permeability to isethionate linearly correlated with the increase in the relative permeability to acetate (Fig. 4), indicating that these mutations have effectively widened the open pore. Notably, the α7-GluClβR-A-2′P mutant (chimera 17) was found to be as permeable to acetate as the α7-GluClβR (PAcet/PCl = 0.1 ± 0.013, mean ± S.E. from 5 cells; e.g. supplemental Fig. S3A).TABLE 2Relative permeability to isethionate and acetate Note: Data are means ± S.E. values.

Homologous DNA recombination is a vital component of DNA metabolism, central to processes such as recombinational DNA repair of stalled replication forks and the exchange of genetic material during meiosis in eukaryotes and conjugation in prokaryotes. RecA protein is the central recombinase in Escherichia coli, and RecA homologues are present in nearly every organism. In E. coli, RecA participates not only in the restart of stalled replication forks but also the induction of the SOS response upon cellular DNA damage distress and translesion DNA synthesis via the error-prone DNA polymerase V (1Lusetti S.L.

When bound to DNA, RecA promotes the hydrolysis of ATP or dATP. Hydrolysis occurs uniformly throughout the filament. ATP hydrolysis is important for some RecA processes including net disassembly of the nucleoprotein filament, bypass of heterologous insertions during DNA three-strand exchange, complete DNA strand exchange with DNA substrates longer than ∼3 kbp, and strand exchange with four DNA strands (1Lusetti S.L.

Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 231-243Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RecA could potentially use the organized waves of ATP hydrolysis to act as a motor, driving completion of strand exchange beyond the barriers mentioned above, or to promote replication fork regression (10Robu M.E.

The detailed mechanism by which the ATP hydrolysis is coordinated in the RecA-dsDNA nucleoprotein filament is currently unknown. RecA is a member of an ATPase family with characteristic single or multiple RecA-like folds, composed of a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices. The ATPase family includes helicases like PcrA, ABC transporters, and with relatively less structural similarity, the AAA+ family of ATPases including ClpA (12Ye J. Osborne A.R. Groll M. Rapoport T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1659: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These proteins all use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to move macromolecules or move along macromolecules, and hence, may be considered molecular motors. A sequence alignment of RecA and helicases including DnaB (13Leipe D.D. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar) highlights the similarities. The authors call attention to a new motif, the [KR]×[KR] motif. This motif is conserved among the DnaB, RecA, Sms, and KaiC families, although absent from the archaean or eukaryotic homologues of RecA. The [KR]×[KR] motif is involved in the in trans catalysis of ATP hydrolysis for some RecA homologues including gp4 of bacteriophage T7 (13Leipe D.D. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Koonin E.V.

The crystal structure of a gp4 fragment that retains hexamer formation and helicase activities (residues 241-566) (15Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) strays from 6-fold rotational symmetry. Indeed, only four of six subunits have bound nucleotide (ADPNP). Arg522 is the third residue in the [KR]×[KR] motif, and in the four subunits that bind ADPNP, Arg522 is close (∼3.5 Å) to the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide of the neighboring subunit. However, Arg522 is displaced in the two nucleotide-free subunits to more than 10 Å away from the equivalent position where the nucleotide would be bound. A conformational change such as this is suggested to couple hydrolysis and helicase activity. It is proposed that Arg522 of T7 gp4 senses hydrolysis of ATP, communicates the hydrolysis between subunits, and promotes conformational changes associated with ATP hydrolysis (14Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 15Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B.

A. 2004; 101: 4373-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this manner, Arg522 would mimic an arginine finger, as is found in Ras and its GTPase-activating protein (GAP). In the Ras-GAP system, it is postulated that Arg789 of GAP similarly reaches across the GAP-Ras interface to stabilize the γ-phosphate of the Ras-bound ATP (17Scheffzek K. Lautwein A. Kabsch W. Reza Ahmadian M. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Another example of in trans catalysis is the RuvB protein (18Putnam C.D. Clancy S.B. Tsuruta H. Gonzalez S. Wetmur J.G. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H.

Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9573-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The RuvB protein is an ATPase that forms a hexameric ring and complexes with RuvA to promote branch migration that is dependent on ATP hydrolysis. Although this protein exhibits some structural similarity to RecA, it appears to lack the [KR]×[KR] motif. The crystal structure features a dimer of Thermus thermophilus RuvB, with each subunit having three domains (labeled N, M, and C). The nucleotide is bound between the N and M domains (19Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The structure of each subunit is very similar, except for the area immediately around the bound nucleotide. One subunit appears to have a triphosphate bound, while the other appears to lack a γ-phosphate; the authors postulated that the structural differences between the subunits could reflect conformational changes dependent on ATP hydrolysis. The crystal structures of wild type and several point mutants of Thermatoga maritima RuvB also indicate ADP is bound between two domains of the RuvB subunit (18Putnam C.D. Clancy S.B. Tsuruta H. Gonzalez S. Wetmur J.G. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting to the authors that the state of the bound nucleotide guides conformational changes between RuvB subunits. More specifically, sensor 1, Walker A, and Walker B were proposed to sense the γ-phosphate and divalent cation, while sensor 2 would accommodate the sugar ring and diphosphate. A study of E. coli RuvB point mutants further extends the proposition that ATP hydrolysis causes conformational changes between subunits by indicating that Arg174 (corresponding to Arg170 of T. maritima RuvB) acts in trans across the subunit interface in the RuvB hexamer (20Hishida T. Han Y.-W. Fujimoto S. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9573-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The Arg174 residue of RuvB does not comprise the active site for ATP hydrolysis in one subunit, but Arg174 is near the catalytic site of the adjacent subunit in the hexamer. The Walker A motif mutant K68A and R174A mutant are both deficient in ATP hydrolysis, but they were found to complement each other when mixed together (20Hishida T. Han Y.-W. Fujimoto S. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9573-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hence, Arg174 of RuvB appears to participate in trans in ATP hydrolysis. In E. coli RecA protein, the residues in the [KR]×[KR] motif are Lys248 and Lys250 (13Leipe D.D. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar). These two residues are hypothesized to be important for ATP hydrolysis and potentially communicate ATP hydrolysis between adjacent subunits in the RecA nucleoprotein filament according to the similarities to homologous proteins described above. Furthermore, the promising importance of one or both of the Lys248 and Lys250 residues was reinforced upon examination of the structure of the RecA-dsDNA nucleoprotein filament (21VanLoock M.S. Yu X. Yang S. Lai A.L. Low C. Campbell M.J. Egelman E.H. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). An impediment to the study of the RecA protein has been the lack of a crystal structure of the RecA filament bound to DNA. The crystal structure of the RecA filament with ADP bound (22Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of the RecA filament (23Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) provided much insight. However, RecA is a DNA-dependent ATPase, and the apo-crystal represents the inactive form of the RecA filament (21VanLoock M.S. Yu X. Yang S. Lai A.L. Low C. Campbell M.J. Egelman E.H. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently a reconstruction of the RecA filament with dsDNA, based on complexes viewed by electron microscopy, was resolved (21VanLoock M.S. Yu X. Yang S. Lai A.L. Low C. Campbell M.J. Egelman E.H. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the RecA filament was fit within electron microscopic images of the RecA-dsDNA filament. To fit the crystal structure electron density into the electron microscopy images of the nucleoprotein filament, the RecA core was rotated and resulted in several significant structural changes. One difference between the apo-crystal structure and the electron microscopic reconstruction of the RecA-dsDNA nucleoprotein filament is location of the ATP binding site (Fig. 1). The nucleotide is bound away from the subunit-subunit interface within the filament in the apo-crystal structure. In contrast, the nucleotide is bound in between adjacent subunits in the RecA-dsDNA nucleoprotein filament reconstruction. The location of the nucleotide between two RecA subunits is supported by recent crystal structures of the archaeal RadA filament (24Wu Y. He Y. Moya I.A. Qian X.G. Luo Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and the eukaryotic Rad51 filament (25Conway A.B. Lynch T.W. Zhang Y. Fortin G.S. Fung C.W. Symington L.S. Rice P.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). VanLoock et al. (21VanLoock M.S. Yu X. Yang S. Lai A.L. Low C. Campbell M.J. Egelman E.H. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) states there are several residues that do not contact the nucleotide in the apo-crystal structure but are near the nucleotide of the adjacent subunit in the electron microscopic reconstruction. The shifted residues include Lys216, Phe217, Arg222, Lys248, Lys250, and Pro254. The two residues Lys248 and Lys250 are of particular interest because, as noted above, they are the two residues that comprise the [KR]×[KR] motif in the E. coli RecA protein. In this study, we sought to examine the K248 residue as an introduction to studying potential roles for the [KR]×[KR] motif in E. coli RecA. The K248A mutation (26Nguyen T.T. Muench K.A. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3107-3113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been previously examined, and although the K248A mutant protein appears to fold normally, the K248A mutant does not form a filament. As such, we chose to introduce a more subtle mutation: K248R. We find that the K248R mutant does bind DNA and forms a nucleoprotein filament, although it hydrolyzes neither ATP nor dATP at a readily measured rate. However, we discovered that a combination of the K248R mutant and another ATP hydrolysis-deficient mutant (27Campbell M.J. Davis R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Campbell M.J. Davis R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), E96D, partially restores dATP hydrolysis. In the nucleoprotein filament, the Lys248 and Glu96 residues are located at the subunit-subunit interface near the bound nucleotide but are opposed across the interface. Direct or indirect coordination between these two residues could be a means of communicating ATP hydrolysis-mediated conformational changes between adjacent subunits in the RecA nucleoprotein filament. Enzymes and Biochemicals—The E. coli SSB protein was purified as described previously (7Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The E. coli wild type RecA protein was purified as described previously (29Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16372-16380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The RecA K248R mutant protein was purified in the same manner as wild type. The RecA K248R/E96D double mutant protein was purified in the same manner as wild type with the following changes: the protein was eluted twice from the ammonium sulfate pellet in a solution of R Buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl buffer (80% cation, pH 7.5), 10% glycerol (w/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol) plus 150 mm ammonium sulfate. The K248R/E96D mutant protein was eluted from the DEAE-Sepharose column with a linear gradient from R Buffer plus 100 mm KCl to R Buffer plus 500 mm KCl. The K248R/E96D mutant protein was eluted from the hydroxyapatite column with a linear gradient from 20 mm phosphate buffer (10 mm KH2PO4,10mm K2HPO4, 10% glycerol (w/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol) to 500 mm phosphate buffer (250 mm KH2PO4, 250 mm K2HPO4, 10% glycerol (w/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol). Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled and dialyzed against R Buffer, and then loaded onto a PBE-94 column (Amersham Biosciences). The K248R/E96D mutant protein was eluted with a linear gradient from R Buffer to R Buffer plus 1 m KCl. The peak and nuclease-free fractions were pooled and concentrated with an Amicon Centricon concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The K248R/E96D mutant protein was dialyzed against R Buffer and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and finally stored at -80 °C. The E96D mutant RecA protein was purified similarly to the K248R/E96D mutant, excluding the PBE-94 column. The purified RecA protein (both mutants and wild type) and SSB protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients of ϵ280 = 2.23 × 104 m-1 cm-1(30Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8039-8044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ϵ280 = 2.38 × 104 m-1 cm-1(31Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. RecA protein and SSB preparations were free of detectable endo- and exonuclease activities on dsDNA and ssDNA. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from Fisher. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphocreatine, ATP, dATP, and NADH were purchased from Sigma. Creatine kinase and ATPγS were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Dithiothreitol was purchased from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH). DNA Substrates—Poly(dT) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and the approximate average length is 229 nucleotides. Bacteriophage ΦX174 circular ssDNA and replicative form I supercoiled circular duplex DNA were purchased from New England Biolabs and Invitrogen, respectively. Full-length linear duplex DNA (dsDNA) was generated by digesting ΦX174 replicative form I DNA (5386 bp) with the XhoI endonuclease. Circular single-stranded DNA from bacteriophage M13mp8 (7229 nucleotides) was prepared as described (32Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8276-8282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of ssDNA and dsDNA were determined by absorbance using 108 and 151 μm A260-1, respectively, as conversion factors. All DNA concentrations are given in micromolar nucleotide concentrations. Circular Dichroism—Wild type RecA protein and two separate preparations of the RecA K248R/E96D double mutant protein were analyzed on a model Aviv 62A DS circular dichroism Spectrometer (Aviv, Lake-wood, NJ) equipped with a temperature controller. For each protein, the solution included 0.25 mg/ml protein, 10 mm KH2PO4, and 10 mm K2HPO4. The solutions were measured at 4 °C and 37 °C. Graphs of wavelength (nm) versus molar ellipticity (degree cm2 dmol-1 × 10-4) were normalized with respect to the absolute minimum at 208 nm. The RecA K248R/E96D protein CD spectrum and wild type RecA protein CD spectrum were superimposed to identify any differing points on the graphs. Two separate preparations of the RecA K248R/E96D mutant protein were examined. Reaction Conditions—All reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris acetate buffer (80% cation, pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 3 mm ATP or dATP, an ATP regenerating system (10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3 mm PEP), and concentrations of DNA and RecA protein were as described below and in the figure legends to Figs. 2 and 4, 5, 6, 7. The coupled spectrophotometric assay also contained 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 1.5 or 0.15 mm NADH. DNA and protein concentrations are indicated for each experiment. Reactions were incubated for 10 min before ATP or dATP was added to start the reaction.FIGURE 4A mixture of the K248R and E96D single mutant RecA proteins on poly(dT) hydrolyzes optimally at a ratio of 1 K248R:1 E96D. RecA-catalyzed dATP hydrolysis was monitored. Reactions included 8 μm total RecA protein, 6 μm poly(dT) linear ssDNA, and dATP. The assay was done in triplicate (all assays are shown). The optimal rate of dATP hydrolysis was observed at a 1:1 ratio of the two single mutants. This rate of dATP hydrolysis, 20.91 ± 0.08 μm/min, was ∼23% of the rate seen with wild type RecA protein alone under the same reaction conditions (91.54 ± 2.86 μm/min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5The mixture of K248R+E96D mutants and the K248R/E96D double mutant RecA protein partially restores DNA-dependent ATP and dATP hydrolysis. RecA-catalyzed dATP or ATP hydrolysis was monitored. Reactions included 8 μm RecA protein, 6 μm poly(dT) linear ssDNA (when included), and dATP or ATP. The rates of hydrolysis were calculated for several trials with and without poly(dT) linear ssDNA for both ATP (A) and dATP (B) substrates. The average for each data set is plotted for each RecA protein. C, for each ATP or dATP data set, the rates of DNA-independent hydrolysis were averaged. The average rate of DNA-independent hydrolysis was then subtracted from each DNA-dependent rate of hydrolysis to result in the corrected rate of hydrolysis. The corrected rates of hydrolysis were then averaged and plotted for each RecA protein. Both E96D and K248R hydrolyzed neither ATP nor dATP at significant rates relative to wild type RecA protein. The 1:1 mixture of the K248R and E96D proteins hydrolyzed both ATP and dATP and hydrolyzed dATP at ∼25% of the wild type dATP hydrolysis rate. The K248R/E96D double mutant RecA protein also hydrolyzed both ATP and dATP, and the double mutant restored dATP hydrolysis to ∼8% of the wild type dATP hydrolysis rate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Wild type (WT) RecA and mutants form DNA-dependent nucleoprotein filaments. Electron micrographs show wild type and mutant RecA filaments on linear ssDNA. Reactions included 8 μm RecA protein and 6 μm poly(dT) linear ssDNA. The RecA protein was preincubated with the DNA for 10 min before dATP was added. The reaction was incubated for 10 min more to permit filament formation. Then ATPγS was added (to 3 mm) and the reaction incubated for 3 min to stabilize the filaments. Reactions were diluted 10-fold, except the K248R reaction (5-fold), before adhesion to the electron microscopy (alcians) grid. Nucleoprotein filaments were viewed with the electron microscope. For each protein, a total of at least 50 representative filaments were measured. Filaments shorter than 30 nm were difficult to distinguish from background and were not included in the reported totals. The results may thus underestimate the representation of shorter filament forms, especially for the K248R mutant. A histogram of filament length is shown for each protein next to the electron microscopy image. Wild type and E96D RecA proteins formed a range of nucleoprotein filament lengths with many long filaments greater than 600 nm. Since this is far longer than the available lengths of poly(dT), this implies an end-to-end joining of nucleoprotein filaments. The K248R and K248R/E96D mutant proteins only formed filaments with shorter lengths. The K248R filaments of measurable length were also present at a much reduced concentration. The E96D+K248R mixed filaments were a range of lengths, mostly median to the wild type and K248R filament lengths. All filaments are DNA-dependent, as no filaments were seen in the absence of DNA (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7The extending K248R/E96D mutant RecA protein filament is compromised and does not displace SSB. RecA-catalyzed dATP hydrolysis was monitored. Reactions included 8 μm RecA protein, 6 μm M13mp8 circular ssDNA, 0.6 μm SSB (when included), and dATP. The RecA protein was preincubated with the DNA for 10 min before dATP was added to initiate the reaction. Time 0 corresponds to the time of dATP addition. For both RecA proteins, there are three conditions: SSB was added initially with dATP (contiguous dashed line), SSB was added ∼20 min after dATP addition (solid line continued as dashed after SSB addition indicated by an arrow), or SSB storage buffer was added ∼20 min after dATP addition (continuous solid line). The top three curves represent hydrolysis by the wild type RecA protein; the bottom three curves represent hydrolysis by the K248R/E96D RecA protein. The solid curves represent dATP hydrolysis before SSB protein was added to the reaction; the dashed lines represent dATP hydrolysis after the addition of SSB protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATP Hydrolysis Assays—A coupled spectrophotometric assay (33Lindsley J.E.

The regeneration of ATP or dATP from ADP and PEP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH and monitored by the decrease in absorbance of NADH at 380 or 340 nm. The 380-nm wavelength was used instead of the absorption maximum at 340 nm so that the signal would remain within the linear range of the spectrophotometer for the duration of the experiment. However, the 340-nm wavelength was used instead of 380 nm to increase the sensitivity of the assay when the hydrolysis rate was slow. The assay was carried out using a Varian Cary 300 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) dual beam spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller and 12-position cell changer. The cell path length and band pass were 1.0 cm and 2 nm, respectively. The NADH extinction coefficients at 380 nm of 1.21 mm-1 cm-1 and at 340 nm of 6.22 mm-1 cm-1 were used to calculate rates of ATP or dATP hydrolysis.

https://openalex.org/W1969623419,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a class of G-protein-coupled receptors that possess a seven transmembrane region involved in the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the nervous system. mGluR orthologs have been identified in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and higher organisms. Drosophila possesses two mGluR genes, DmGluRA and DmXR. We screened the Dictyostelium genome data base using the ligand binding domain of rat mGluR1 as bait, and identified a new receptor, DdmGluPR, belonging to the mGluR family. Similar to Drosophila DmXR, the residues of mGluRs involved in the binding of the α-carboxylic and α-amino groups of glutamate were well conserved in DdmGluPR, but the residues interacting with the γ-carboxylic group of glutamate were not. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that DdmGluPR diverged after the mGluR family-GABAB receptors split but before mGluR family divergence. DdmGluPR mRNA was expressed in vegetative cells and throughout starvation-induced development, but the level of the expression was relatively high until 4 h after starvation. DdmGluPR was localized to the plasma membrane of axenically grown Ax-2 cells expressed as a green fluorescent protein fusion protein. DdmGluPR-null cells grew faster at high cell density and reached higher densities than wild-type cells. DdmGluPR-null cells exhibited delayed aggregates formation upon starvation and impaired chemotaxis toward cAMP. Although expressions of cAR1 and aca, cAMP-signaling components, were rapidly induced and peaked at 2–4 h in wild-type cells, DdmGluPR-null cells displayed sustained and peaked at 8 h of the expressions of these genes. Our findings suggest the involvement of DdmGluPR in the early development of Dictyostelium discoideum.

Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) 4The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; LBD, ligand binding domain; CMF, conditioned medium factor; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAR, GABA receptor; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; GFP, green fluorescent protein; iGluR, ionotropic GluR. are a class of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that possess a seven-transmembrane region and couple with second messenger systems including phosphoinositide hydrolysis and regulation of adenylate cyclase activation. mGluRs are key receptors in the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The eight subtypes of mGluRs are classified into three subgroups according to sequence similarity, agonist selectivity, and effector system differences: subgroup I (mGluR1 and -5), subgroup II (mGluR2 and -3), and subgroup III (mGluR4, -6, -7, and -8) (1Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). The mGluR structure is divided into three regions: the extracellular region, the seven-transmembrane spanning region, and the cytoplasmic region (2Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). The extracellular region is further divided into the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the cysteine-rich region. They share sequence similarity with the calcium-sensing receptor (3Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi O. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar) and the pheromone receptor (4Herrada G. Dulac C.A.

The primary structure and pharmacology of mGluRs are evolutionarily well conserved in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and higher mammals. Sequence analysis of the C. elegans genome reveals the presence of one homologue for each group (6Pin J.P. Acher F. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002; 1: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Two kinds of mGluRs, DmGluRA and DmXR, have been reported in Drosophila (7Parmentier M.L. Pin J.P. Bochaert J. Grau Y. J.

DmGluRA shares a very similar pharmacological profile with its mammalian orthologues, mGluR2 and mGluR3, although DmXR is insensitive to glutamate or any other standard amino acids. A sequence analysis of the LBD of Drosophila DmXR revels that the residues contacting the amino acid moiety of glutamate are conserved, whereas the residues interacting with the γ-carboxylic group are not. The social ameba Dictyostelium discoideum is a unicellular eukaryote and an ideal model organism to investigate developmental regulation. A proteome-based phylogeny shows that Dictyostelium diverged from the animal-fungal lineage after the plant-animal split but before the divergence of the fungi (9Eichinger L. Pachebat J.A.

D. discoideum has an ability to alternate between unicellular and multicellular forms. Dictyostelium cells grow vegetatively as individual amebae and gather with neighboring cells to form aggregates upon starvation. After aggregation, cells differentiate to specific cell types and finally culminate into a fruiting body consisting of spores on top of a supporting stalk. During this process, extracellular cAMP signaling and cAMP-specific GPCRs are involved in its multicellular development. One of four highly homologous cAMP receptors, cAR1, is essential for aggregation and subsequent development. cAR1 mediates cAMP relay response by activating an adenylyl cyclase (10Klein P.S. Sun T.J.

Here, we screened the Dictyostelium genome using the BLAST program with the rat mGluR1 LBD as bait, and identified a new receptor, DdmGluPR (Dictyostelium mGlu precursor receptor), belonging to the mGluR family. The predicted protein contains a domain with homologous sequence to the LBD of mGluRs and a seven-transmembrane region. A sequence comparison between DdmGluPR and mGluRs revealed that only part of the residues involved in the glutamate binding was conserved like Drosophila DmXR. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that DdmGluPR diverged after the mGluR family-GABABRs split but before mGluR family divergence. We propose that DdmGluPR was the evolutionary precursor to mGluRs. We also demonstrated the important roles of the DdmGluPR gene in aggregates formation during Dictyostelium development. Cell Growth and Development—Vegetative cells of D. discoideum Ax-2 were grown axenically in PS-medium (1% peptone, 0.7% yeast extract, 1.5% d-glucose, 0.11% KH2PO4, 0.05% Na2HPO4, 40 ng/ml vitamin B12, 80 ng/ml folic acid) at 22 °C. DdmGluPR-null cells were grown in PS-medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml blasticidin S (Invitrogen). To allow cells to differentiate, cells were washed in 10 mm Na-potassium phosphate buffer (10 mm Na-potassium phosphate, 0.2 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 6.1), plated on non-nutrient agar (1.5% agar in 10 mm Na-K phosphate buffer) at a density of 107 cells/ml, and incubated at 22 °C. Conditioned medium was prepared by starving wild-type or DdmGluPR-null cells at 5 × 106 cells/ml in 10 mm Na-potassium phosphate buffer in shaking culture for 20 h. To examine the effect of conditioned medium on cell aggregation, cells were starved in submerged culture at densities 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 × 105 cells/ml in 10 mm Na-potassium phosphate buffer. Sequence Analysis—BLAST searches were performed using the data base for Dictyostelium and for other organisms (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The signal sequence and transmembrane regions of DdmXR were predicted by using PSORTII and SOSUI. The sequence alignment between DdmGluPR, the Drosophila DmXR, and the mouse mGluR3 was produced using ClustalW. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using class III GPCR sequences from various species retrieved from the data base. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW. The resulting multi-alignment was then used for the construction of an evolutionary tree by the Neighbor Joining method using MEGA2 program. Northern Blot Analysis—cDNAs for DdmGluPR, cAR1, aca, psA spiA, discoidin, and Ig7 were obtained by RT-PCR, cloned into pT7 Blue (Novagen) or pBluescript SK (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. The ecmB gene was kindly provided from Dr. R. Escalante at Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Spain. All of the cDNAs were transcriptionally labeled by T3 or T7 RNA polymerases to make the antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes. The extracted total RNA (5 μg) were resolved on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred onto positively charged nylon transfer membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences). Hybridizations were carried out using digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe. Expression of GFP-DdmGluPR—The expression vector pDXA-GFP2 was kindly provided by Dr. Thomas T. Egelhoff at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine (15Deery W.J. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34476-34482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GFP was fused at the N terminus of DdmGluPR. The construct was introduced into Dictyostelium by electroporation, and stable transformants were selected on G418. DdmGluPR Gene Inactivation—The DdmGluPR-null strains were generated by gene targeting. cDNA encompassing the entire coding region (∼2.5 kbp) with restriction sites EcoRI and XbaI at 5′ and 3′, respectively, was obtained by RT-PCR and cloned into pBluescript SK. The targeting construct contains the digested fragment with EcoRI and HindIII (∼1.7 kbp), and the Bsr cassette was inserted at the KpnI site. The Bsr cassette was kindly provided by Drs. Y. Tanaka and T. Morio at University of Tsukuba, Japan. The targeting construct was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and introduced into wild-type Ax-2 cells. Transformants were selected for blasticidin resistance. Clone C2 was identified as the DdmGluPR-null strain and used for the experiments. Assay for Chemotaxis toward cAMP—Prior to assay, Dictyostelium cells were starved in 10 mm Na-K buffer, pH 6.1, at 22 °C for 4 h. Small wells in the center of 1.5% non-nutrient agar plates were filled with cAMP solution (5 μl of 10 μm solution), and the starved cells were spotted on the agar plates 5 mm from the edge of the well at 107 cells/ml. The plates were further incubated for 5 h at 22°C, and the resultant chemotaxis toward the wells was observed under a phase contrast microscope. To examine the effects of most of natural amino acids including Glu, Arg, Lys, Asp, His, Gly, Gln, Pro, Ser, Ala, Asn, Thr, Leu, Met, Val, and GABA on starvation-induced chemotactic response toward cAMP, all of the reagents were dissolved in water at 100 mm (pH 6.1). The cells were starved, and the chemotactic response to cAMP was observed in the presence of each reagent at 1 mm. Sequence Analysis of Dictyostelium DdmGluPR Homologous to mGluRs—We screened the Dictyostelium genome data base using the BLAST program with the rat mGluR1 LBD (amino acid residue 33–522) as a bait and identified a new receptor homologous to mGluRs, called DdmGluPR (Dictyostelium mGlu precursor receptor), in D. discoideum (DDB0231976 GenBank™ accession number DQ447637). The DdmGluPR gene encodes an 816-amino-acid protein as shown in Fig. 1A. The N terminus of the predicted amino acid sequence of DdmGluPR contained a potential signal sequence, and seven possible transmembrane regions were predicted from hydrophobicity algorithms for a plasma membrane protein (Fig. 1B). These structural features suggest that DdmGluPR is a class of GPCR. The mGluRs share sequence similarity with the GABAB receptors (GABABRs), the calcium-sensing receptor, and pheromone receptors and constitute the class III GPCR family. The extracellular region of DdmGluPR showed the closest sequence similarity to mouse mGluR3 and Drosophila DmXR among the class III GPCR family. The extracellular region of mGluRs contains the LBD and the cysteine-rich region. The cysteine-rich region is conserved among all mGluR subtypes and the calcium-sensing receptor but not in the GABABRs. Because DdmGluPR has no cysteine-rich regions, an alignment of the derived amino acid sequences from the extracellular region of DdmGluPR and the LBDs of mouse mGluR3 and Drosophila DmXR is provided in Fig. 2A. The analysis of crystal structures of the LBD of mGluR1 identified several key residues involved in the glutamate binding (2Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Ser-165 and Thr-188 and Asp-208, Tyr-236, and Asp-318 in mGluR1 are involved in the binding of the α-carboxylic and α-amino groups of glutamate, respectively. In addition, Arg-78 and Lys-409 in mGluR1 are involved in the binding of the γ-carboxylic group of glutamate. Although the residues of DdmGluPR involved in the binding of the α-carboxylic and α-amino groups of glutamate were well conserved, the residues interacting with the γ-carboxylic group of glutamate were not (Fig. 2). As shown in an alignment, DdmGluPR has extensive homology at the regions presumed for the binding of the α-carboxylic and α-amino groups of glutamate (indicated as a box in Fig. 2A) with mouse mGluR3 and Drosophila DmXR (27.5 and 26.9% identical and 49.1 and 52.1% similarity with mouse mGluR3 and Drosophila DmXR, respectively). Although, the transmembrane region of DdmGluPR showed closest sequence similarity to rat or human GABABR2 among the class III GPCR family (30 and 18% identical, and 60 and 46.5% similarity with human GABABR2 and mouse mGluR3, respectively) (data not shown). The residues of Drosophila DmXR for interacting with the γ-carboxylic group of glutamate are also missing, and glutamate cannot activate Drosophila DmXR (8Mitri C. Parmentier M.L. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Grau Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9313-9320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that DdmGluPR is not a glutamate receptor.FIGURE 2Multiple alignment of DdmGluPR, mouse mGluR3, and Drosophila DmXR.

The phylogenetic tree revealed three main subclasses corresponding to GABABRs, calcium-sensing and pheromone receptors, and mGluRs. DdmGluPR diverged after the mGluR family-GABABRs split but before mGluR family divergence. Although, Drosophila DmXR diverged after mGluRs calcium-sensing and pheromone receptors split. The same phylogenetic relations were obtained with or without excluding positions with gaps. Because DdmGluPR has a hybrid structure with an extracellular region similar to mGluRs and a transmembrane region similar to GABABRs, we propose that DdmGluPR was the evolutionary precursor to mGluRs. Expression and Localization of DdmGluPR—We isolated DdmGluPR cDNA encompassing the entire coding region (∼2.5 kbp) by RT-PCR. Northern blot was carried out to determine the temporal regulation of DdmGluPR expression during development (Fig. 4A). DdmGluPR mRNA was expressed in vegetative cells and throughout development. The level of expression was relatively high until 4 h after starvation and gradually decreased thereafter, suggesting that it functions during the differentiation phase. To examine the localization of DdmGluPR, we expressed the DdmGluPR protein carrying a GFP tag at the N terminus. As shown in Fig. 4B, GFP-DdmGluPR was localized to the plasma membrane of axenically grown Ax-2 cells. Inactivation of the DdmGluPR Gene—To determine the functional importance of DdmGluPR, the DdmGluPR gene was inactivated by homologous recombination. The targeting construct containing a part of the coding region with an insertion of a blasticidin cassette (Fig. 5A) was introduced into the Dictyostelium wild-type strain Ax-2. Individual clones were selected, and positive clones were identified by the presence of an ∼3-kb PCR product that is ∼1.5 kb in wild-type cells (Fig. 5B, left panel). The disruption of DdmGluPR was further confirmed by the absence of a PCR product from an oligo(dT)-primed RT-PCR (Fig. 5B, right panel). Cell Growth and Prestarvation Response in DdmGluPR-null Mutant—Because DdmGluPR was expressed in vegetative phase cells, we examined the cell growth of the DdmGluPR-null mutant. DdmGluPR-null cells grew faster at high cell density compared with wild-type Ax-2 cells and reached higher densities than Ax-2 cells (Fig. 6A). The absence of DdmGluPR appeared to enhance vegetative growth. A part of the differentiation program has been shown to begin before starvation (prestarvation response); premature expression of early developmental genes such as discoidin and cAR1 is induced as the density of growing cells increased (12Rathi A. Clarke A. Mech. Dev. 1992; 36: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, no significant differences in the expressions of discoidin and cAR1 were detected between growing DdmGluPR-null cells and wild-type Ax-2 cells (Fig. 6B). Thus, the regulation of prestarvation gene expression does not require DdmGluPR. Development of DdmGluPR-null Mutant—To investigate the defect in the developmental process of the DdmGluPR-null mutant, development on non-nutrient agar plates was monitored microscopically. As shown in Fig. 7, DdmGluPR-null cells exhibited delayed aggregates formation compared with wild-type Ax-2 cells. We observed faint aggregates in wild-type cells at 5 h after starvation, and the aggregates grew larger and increased density thereafter, whereas the aggregates in DdmGluPR-null cells were not prominent even after 7 h and showed low density at 8 h. To analyze the relation of delayed aggregates formation in DdmGluPR-null cells to early gene expressions such as cAR1 and aca, we examined the expression patterns of these genes during development in DdmGluPR-null cells and wild-type Ax-2 cells by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 8A). cAR1 and aca were rapidly induced and peaked 2–4 h upon starvation and decreased thereafter in wild-type cells, whereas the expressions of these genes were reduced, sustained, and peaked at ∼8 h in DdmGluPR-null cells compared with wild-type cells. We next examined chemotaxis in response to cAMP of DdmGluPR-null cells. The movement of cells toward a source of cAMP was observed microscopically. Fig. 8B showed directional movement of DdmGluPR-null cells toward cAMP, but it was inefficient. The migration distance from the spot of DdmGluPR-null cells was 66% of that of wild-type cells. Our findings suggest that the delayed aggregate formation of DdmGluPR-null cells phenotype is caused by inefficient chemotaxis toward cAMP with aberrant expression pattern of cAR1 and aca during early development. We further tested the ability of DdmGluPR expression to rescue the phenotype of DdmGluPR-null cells. The null cells that expressed GFP-DdmGluPR showed restorations of the delayed aggregates formation and the inefficient chemotaxis toward cAMP almost similar to those of Ax-2 cells (Fig. 9, A and B).FIGURE 8Gene expression of cAMP-signaling components and chemotaxis response to cAMP in DdmGluPR-null cells. A, wild-type Ax-2 (Wild) and DdmGluPR-null (KO) cells were starved on non-nutrient agar plates for the time indicated. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by northern blotting using cRNA probes for cAR1, aca, and Ig7. B, wild-type Ax-2 and DdmGluPR-null cells were starved in 10 mm Na-K buffer, pH 6.1, at 22 °C for 4 h. Small wells in the center of 1.5% non-nutrient agar plates were filled with cAMP solution (5 μl of 10 μm solution), and the starved cells were spotted on the agar plates 5 mm from the edge of the well at 1 × 107 cells/ml. The plates were further incubated for 5 h at 22 °C, and the resultant chemotaxis toward the wells was observed under a phase contrast microscope (left panel). The position of the cells spotted and the direction of cAMP gradient are indicated at the top. Chemotaxis response to cAMP was quantified by measuring the distance of cell migration of wild-type Ax-2 and DdmXR-null cells in each spot (right panel). Each value represents the mean ± S.E.

To test the possibility of agonist or antagonist effect of an amino acid on DdmGluPR, we examined the effects of most of natural amino acids including Glu, Arg, Lys, Asp, His, Gly, Gln, Pro, Ser, Ala, Asn, Thr, Leu, Met, Val, and GABA on the starvation-induced chemotactic response toward cAMP. As shown in Fig. 9C, we could not detect any alteration of chemotactic response toward cAMP in the presence of an amino acid as indicated or GABA at 1 mm, suggesting that a simple amino acid is not a ligand for DdmGluPR. Aggregate formation on non-nutrient agar was also not affected in the presence of these amino acids or GABA (data not shown). Aggregation of starved cells requires the presence of extracellular molecules, the CMF involved in a cell density-sensing mechanism. CMF receptors appears to mediate the G-dependent and G-independent signal transductions (13Brazill D.T. Lindsey D.F. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Levi S. Polyakov M. Egelhoff T.T. Plasmid. 2000; 44: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To test the sensitivity to CMF, we starved wild-type and DdmGluPR-null cells at various densities in submerged culture in the presence or absence of CMF (Table 1). Both wild-type and DdmGluPR-null cells starved in the absence of CMF were able to aggregate in 24 h at densities 4 × 105 cells/ml or above. The same cells starved for 24 h in the presence of CMF prepared from either wild-type or DdmGluPR-null cells formed aggregates at lower densities. Thus, the cell density-sensing mechanism by CMF does not require DdmGluPR.TABLE 1Ability to aggregate at different cell densitiesCell Density (× 104/ml)804020105Wild++---Wild in CMF-A+++++Wild in CMF-B+++++KO++---KO in CMF-A+++++ Open table in a new tab Glutamate receptors are categorized into ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and mGluRs. The iGluRs internally contain ligandgated ion channels. Chen et al. (16Chen G.Q. Cui C. Mayer M.L. Gouaux E. Nature. 1999; 402: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have identified an iGluR, GluR0, from a prokaryote, the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. GluR0 has a hybrid structure between iGluRs and potassium channels and is thought to be a common ancestor for these molecular families. The mGluRs are structurally and evolutionally distinct from the iGluRs. Here, we identified a new receptor DdmGluPR in Dictyostelium belonging to the mGluR family. The BLAST search showed that the extracellular region of DdmGluPR was closest in sequence similarity to mouse mGluR3 and Drosophila DmXR. Mitri et al. (8Mitri C. Parmentier M.L. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Grau Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9313-9320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has found the receptor called mXR as belonging to the mGluR subclass in insects such as the Anopheles, Apis, and Drosophila. They could not find any orthologues of mXR in C. elegans or mammalian genomes. The residues of mGluRs involved in the binding of the α-carboxylic and α-amino groups of glutamate were well conserved in both of DdmGluPR and Drosophila DmXR but the residues interacting with the γ-carboxylic group of glutamate were not. Ligands for Drosophila DmXR and DdmGluPR are not determined yet, but this suggests that the natural ligand might be an amino acid-like molecule. However, a simple amino acid is unlikely as a ligand. The GABABR and the mGluR families appeared to be derived from a common ancestral receptor. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that DdmGluPR diverged after the mGluR family-GABABRs split but before mGluR family divergence. Although, Drosophila DmXR diverged after mGluR calcium-sensing and pheromone receptors split. This is in good agreement with the sequence in which the transmembrane region of DdmGluPR is similar to GABABRs while the region of DmXR is similar to mGluRs. Thus, we propose that DdmGluPR is an ancestor leading to the mGluR family divergence, and Drosophila DmXR is a direct ancestor for mGluRs divergence. mXR-type receptors would disappear during evolution in higher organisms except insects. We also described the functional involvement of DdmGluPR in the early development of D. discoideum. Prestarvation factors and conditioned medium factors were not the ligands for DdmGluPR, because the responses against these factors showed no difference between wild-type cells and DdmGluPR-null cells. We also noted that the DdmGluPR-null mutant was not affected in sensing folate (data not shown), although folate contains a glutamate structure. DdmGluPR mRNA was expressed in vegetative cells and throughout development, but the level of the expression was relatively high until 4 h and peaked at 2 h (data not shown) after starvation, suggesting that an unknown ligand is released at early development and affects the expressions of cAR1 and aca through DdmGluPR. The mGluRs are known to modulate synaptic properties in vertebrates. The Drosophila genome possesses another mGluR gene, DmGluRA, an mGluR2/3 ortholog (7Parmentier M.L. Pin J.P. Bochaert J. Grau Y. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6687-6694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DmGluRA is the only functional mGluR in Drosophila. Bogdanik et al. (17Bogdanik L. Mohrmann R. Ramaekers A. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Broadie K. Parmentier M.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9105-9116Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have described that DmGluRA is expressed at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction and the null mutants display an increase in synaptic facilitation during short stimulus trains. The mutant phenotype cannot be replicated by an acute application of mGluR antagonists, suggesting that DmGluRA regulates the development of presynaptic properties rather than directly controlling short term modulation. To understand the functional roles of DdmGluPR and mXRs will provide information for developmental roles of mGluRs in the nervous system or other tissues. We thank Dr. Y.

Here, we demonstrate that CD45, a key component of the T cell receptor pathway, plays a crucial role in apoptosis induced by HIV-1 gp120. We observed that HIV-1 gp120-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced in a CD45-deficient cell line and that reconstitution of CD45 in these cells restored gp120-induced apoptosis. However, expression of a chimeric protein containing only the intracellular phosphatase domain was not able to restore the apoptotic function in the CD45-negative clone, indicating an important role for the extracellular domain of CD45 in this function. The role of CD45 in gp120-induced apoptosis was further confirmed in T cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a selective CD45 inhibitor as well as CD45-specific small interfering RNA. We also observed that gp120 treatment induced CD45 association with the HIV coreceptor CXCR4. Further elucidation of downstream signaling events revealed that CD45 modulates HIV-1 gp120-induced apoptosis by regulating Fas ligand induction and activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway.

Recently, it has been shown that CD45 also modulates many other T cell functions, including cytokine- and integrin-mediated signaling pathways as well as signals emanating from the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (25Irie-Sasaki J.

In addition, several distinct observations point to a role for CD45 in regulating survival and apoptotic pathways in immune cells (23Byth K.F. Conroy L.A. Howlett S. Smith A.J. May J. Alexander D.R.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 707-713PubMed Google Scholar). With regard to HIV, although a role for CD45 has been proposed in HIV-infected cells (32Guntermann C. Amft N. Murphy B.J. Nye K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 33Giovannetti A. Pierdominici M. Mazzetta F. Mazzone A.M. Ricci G. Prozzo A. Pandolfi F. Paganelli R. Aiuti F. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), its role in the bystander apoptotic effect of HIV on T cells has not been investigated. In this study, we therefore aimed to gain insight into the involvement of CD45 in the gp120-mediated apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells. Here, we analyzed the apoptotic responses and signaling pathways that are regulated by CD45 in mutant cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using an in vitro model of HIV-1 envelope-mediated apoptosis. Our data show that CD45-negative cell lines (J45.01) are fairly resistant to gp120-induced apoptosis. Differential induction of Fas ligand (FasL) and the consequent activation of the Fas/FasL pathway were observed in CD45-positive and CD45-negative T cell clones upon gp120-induced apoptosis. We also found that CD45 regulates apoptosis via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. These findings implicate a novel role for CD45 in HIV-1 gp120-induced apoptosis in vitro. Cells and Antibodies—The human Jurkat T cell line (clone JE6.1) and the CD45-deficient variant of this clone (J45.01) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). J45/CH11 (expressing a chimeric protein containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of HLA-A2 and the phosphatase domain of CD45), its control J45/A2 (expressing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of HLA-A2), and J45/LB3 (J45.01 transfectants expressing normal human CD45) were kindly provided by Dr. Gary A. Koretzky (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine) and Dr. Eric J. Brown (University of California, San Francisco, CA), respectively, and have been described previously (27Shenoi H. Seavitt J. Zheleznyak A. Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7120-7127PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hovis R.R. Donovan J.A. Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Goldman F.D. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1993; 260: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Human PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood samples obtained from normal healthy donors by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation (Amersham Biosciences). The mononuclear cell fraction was then depleted from macrophages by adherence to cell culture flasks for 1 h at 37 °C. Antibodies to procaspase-3, Fas, FasL, Lck, and paxillin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antiphospho-Akt Ser473, anti-phospho-Lck Tyr505, anti-Akt, and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibody was obtained from Clontech. Anti-CD3 and anti-CD45 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Immunotech and Pharmingen, respectively. Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-CD4 antibody, PE-labeled anti-CXCR4 antibody, PE-labeled anti-mouse IgG, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 (BD Biosciences) were used for the flow cytometric studies. Anti-gp120 (HIV-1) monoclonal antibody was obtained from ImmunoDiagnostics, Inc. (Woburn, MA). Reagents—Electrophoresis reagents and nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from Bio-Rad. The selective CD45 inhibitor (a pivalamide with a 9,10-phenanthrenedione core) was obtained from Calbiochem. The specific PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, sodium orthovanadate, staurosporine, and the protease inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. HIV-1 gp120 (IIIB) was obtained from Protein Sciences Corp. (Meriden, CT). Cell-surface Staining and Flow Cytometric Analysis—To detect CD4 and CXCR4 expression, Jurkat cells were stained directly with specific PE-labeled antibodies. For CD3 and CD45 expression, the cells were stained with anti-CD45 and anti-CD3 primary monoclonal antibodies, respectively, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Flow cytometry was carried out using a FACSCalibur, and the data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Induction and Detection of Apoptosis—Cells from various clones of the human Jurkat T cell line or mutant cell lines or PBMCs (2 × 106/ml) were subjected to 10 nm recombinant HIV-1 gp120 (IIIB) for 30 min at 37 °C. They were then washed once, treated with an equal concentration of mouse anti-gp120 (HIV-1) monoclonal antibody (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Germantown, MD), incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, washed once, and seeded in 12-well plates coated with anti-CD3 antibody (2 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 37°C). Untreated cells and cells treated with anti-CD3 antibody alone were used as controls. Anti-CD3 antibody was used at a suboptimal concentration so that it would be unable to trigger significant apoptosis when used alone. Apoptosis was detected at the end of a 48-h incubation at 37 °C using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) kit (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, cells were fixed in freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution (4% in PBS at pH 7.4) for 1 h, washed with PBS, incubated in permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice, washed with PBS, and then incubated in the TUNEL reaction mixture at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were washed again three times with PBS before analysis by flow cytometry. The net percentage of apoptosis was calculated by subtracting the apoptosis in the presence of immobilized anti-CD3 antibody alone from the apoptosis observed upon treatment with gp120/anti-gp120 antibody/immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. For induction of staurosporine- and anti-Fas antibody-mediated apoptosis, the cells were treated with 100 nm staurosporine and 100 ng/ml agonistic anti-Fas monoclonal antibody CH11 (Calbiochem). For induction of apoptosis using γ-irradiation, cells were subjected to a dose of 10 grays/min at room temperature using an irradiator (CIS Biointernational, Bedford, MA). In addition, to generate anti-CD3 antibody-induced apoptosis, the cells were treated with 20 μg/ml immobilized anti-CD3 antibody coated onto 12-well plates as described above. Inhibition of gp120-induced Apoptosis—For the inhibition experiments, cells (2 × 106/ml) were pretreated with the indicated doses of PI3K inhibitors and the CD45 phosphatase inhibitor for 1 h at 37 °C and then subjected to apoptosis according to the protocol described above. The inhibitors were maintained throughout all passages of apoptosis induction at the same doses used for the pretreatment. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Aliquots of total protein extracts (50 μg) were run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection involved specific primary antibodies, appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Equal loading and transfer were monitored by probing for anti-actin or anti-paxillin antibody. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of protein from the stimulated time points were clarified by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B or GammaBind™ Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were removed by brief centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with different primary antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of the antigen/antibody complexes was performed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose or GammaBind™-Sepharose (50% suspension). Non-specific interacting proteins were removed by washing the beads three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and once with PBS. Immunoprecipitated complexes were solubilized in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and further analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. CD45 Activity in Cell Lysates—CD45 tyrosine phosphatase activity in the lysates of Jurkat T cells was measured using the colorimetric human active CD45 DuoSet IC assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, an immobilized antibody specific for CD45 was used to capture both active and inactive CD45. After washing away unbound material, a synthetic phosphopeptide substrate was added and was then dephosphorylated by active CD45 to generate free phosphate and unphosphorylated peptide. The free phosphate was detected by a sensitive dye binding assay using malachite green and molybdic acid at 620 nm on a microplate reader. CD45 tyrosine phosphatase activity was determined by calculating the rate of phosphate release. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Knockdown—RNAi-mediated knockdown of CD45 was performed using synthetic duplex RNA oligonucleotides as described by Oliveira and Goodell (34Oliveira D.M. Goodell M.A. Genesis. 2003; 36: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The 19-nucleotide targets for siRNAs were as follows: GUCUUUGUCACAGGGCAAA (Dharmacon, Inc., Boulder, CO). PBMCs were electroporated with 100 nm siRNA using the Amaxa system (Amaxa GmbH, Cologne, Germany). CD45 siRNA-mediated knockdown was estimated by detection of CD45 receptor expression 48 h after the initial transfection by flow cytometry. gp120 Binding Assay—For determination of gp120 binding, cells (2 × 106/ml) were treated with HIV-1 gp120 (10 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C, then with equal concentrations of anti-gp120 (HIV-1) antibody for 30 min at 4 °C, and finally with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 (1:50 dilution) for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Transient Transfection—The Akt constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Michael E. Greenberg (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Plasmid carrying the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Akt derivative rendered kinase-inactive by mutation within the catalytic domain of Akt (HA-Akt(K179M)), plasmid carrying HA-tagged wild-type Akt, or the pcDNA control vector was transfected into Jurkat T cells by electroporation using the Amaxa Nucleofector system. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the means ± S.D. of data obtained from three or four experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. In this study, we used a model in which HIV-1 gp120 cross-linked with anti-gp120 antibody induces apoptosis of Jurkat T cells and PBMCs in the presence of CD3/TCR activation. This model has been used previously in several studies involving gp120-induced apoptosis (12Banda N.K. Bernier J. Kurahara D.K. Kurrle R. Haigwood N. Sekaly R.P. Finkel T.H. J. Exp.

In fact, this system is equivalent to the in vivo situation, in which gp120 can be found in HIV-1-infected individuals on the surface of infected cells, on the surface of free virus, or shed from infected cells. In addition, the host generates anti-gp120 antibody as an immune response to the virus. Hence, such gp120/anti-gp120 antibody complexes, bound to CD4 in the uninfected cells in the presence of an activating antigen or infectious agent, receive stimulatory signals through TCR, which may translate into increased levels of apoptosis. Differential Susceptibility of the CD45 Clones to gp120-induced Apoptosis—We demonstrated the role of CD45 in gp120-induced apoptosis by examining J45.01, a CD45-deficient Jurkat cell line. This Jurkat cell variant expressed minimal amounts of CD45 on its surface, yet expressed other T cell-surface markers (including CD3, CXCR4, and CD4) at levels similar to those observed in the wild-type Jurkat cells (Fig. 1). The CD45-deficient J45.01 cells showed a reduced apoptotic response to gp120 (10 nm) in comparison with the control JE6.1 Jurkat cells (Fig. 2A). The difference in apoptotic response to gp120 was consistent over a concentration range of 10–100 nm (data not shown). We used TUNEL assays to evaluate apoptosis.FIGURE 2CD45 is necessary for optimal gp120-mediated apoptosis. A, CD45-positive (JE6.1) and CD45-negative (J45.01) cells were treated with 10 nm gp120 and an equal concentration of anti-gp120 antibody and cultured with immobilized anti-CD3 antibody for 48 h. Controls included JE6.1 and J45.01 cells treated with anti-CD3 antibody, gp120, or anti-gp120 antibody alone. The cells were stained using the TUNEL assay as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the percentage of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. *, p < 0.05 versus wild-type Jurkat T cells (JE6.1). Data are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.

Cells stained with control IgG represent the antibody control. CD45-positive (JE6.1), CD45-negative (J45.01), and CD45 reconstituted (J45/LB3) cells were stimulated with gp120, and apoptosis induction was determined at 12, 24, and 48 h by TUNEL staining. The percentage of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry (right panel). Data are the means ± S.D. of triplicate assays. FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.

Data are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. D, gp120-induced activation of caspase-3 (left panel) and cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (right panel) were decreased in CD45-deficient cells (J45.01). Caspase activation was determined by Western blot analysis of the cytosolic extracts from J45.01 (CD45–/–) and JE6.1 (CD45+/+) cells 24–48 h after gp120 treatment. Equal loading and transfer were monitored by probing for anti-paxillin antibody. Results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the observed difference in apoptosis between the wild-type Jurkat cells and J45.01 cells was due to the lack of CD45 molecules, gp120-induced apoptosis was evaluated in J45.01 cells that were reconstituted with normal human CD45 (J45/LB3). The reconstituted cell line (J45/LB3) and the wild-type Jurkat cells (JE6.1) expressed comparable levels of CD45 (Fig. 2B, left panel). Susceptibility to gp120-induced apoptosis was restored to ∼80% in the J45/LB3 cells (Fig. 2B, right panel). Knockdown of CD45 in Primary T Cells Leads to a Decrease in gp120-induced Apoptosis—To further confirm, by an independent method, the effect of CD45 down-regulation on gp120-induced apoptosis of primary cells, we utilized siRNA-driven CD45 knockdown (34Oliveira D.M. Goodell M.A. Genesis. 2003; 36: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in PBMCs. As shown in Fig. 2C (left panel), there was significant knockdown of CD45 in PBMCs transfected with the CD45 siRNA compared with the control (irrelevant) siRNA. When the cells transfected with the CD45 siRNA were subjected to gp120-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2C, right panel), there was an ∼35% reduction in apoptosis, thus corroborating the results observed with the CD45-deficient cell line. The above data further substantiate the key role of CD45 in apoptosis induced by gp120. Caspase Activation Is Decreased in CD45-deficient Cells—To quantify the levels of apoptosis, we monitored several established apoptotic markers, including detection of caspase-3 and cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Caspases are key regulators of the induction and execution of apoptosis, with caspase-3 being a crucial executor for the apoptotic process. As shown in Fig. 2D (left panel), there was decreased processing of procaspase-3 in the J45.01 cells (CD45–/–) compared with the wild-type JE6.1 cells (CD45+/+) upon treatment with gp120. We found that cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by caspase-3 was also reduced in the CD45-deficient cells (Fig. 2D, right panel). The Extracellular Domain and the Intracellular Phosphatase Domain of CD45 Are Responsible for Optimal gp120-induced Apoptosis—CD45 is a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase with an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular phosphatase domain. Here, we chose to examine the structural components of CD45 that are important for HIV gp120-induced apoptosis. For this purpose, we analyzed the ability of transfectants expressing hybrid CD45 cDNA to restore gp120-induced apoptosis (36Hovis R.R. Donovan J.A. Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Goldman F.D. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1993; 260: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the CD45-deficient Jurkat cells expressing a chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the major histocompatibility complex class I protein and the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 (J45/CH11) were not able to restore the gp120-induced apoptosis. As a control, we used a CD45-deficient cell line with only the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the major histocompatibility complex class I protein (J45/A2). These results suggest the involvement of the extracellular domain of CD45 in regulating gp120-induced apoptosis. In addition, we evaluated the effect of a recently discovered CD45 phosphatase inhibitor (37Urbanek R.A. Suchard S.J. Steelman G.B. Knappenberger K.S. Sygowski L.A. Veale C.A. Chapdelaine M.J. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1777-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) on gp120-induced apoptosis. The inhibitor is a cell-permeable pivalamide with a 9,10-phenanthrenedione core that has been shown to act as a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of CD45 phosphatase (37Urbanek R.A. Suchard S.J. Steelman G.B. Knappenberger K.S. Sygowski L.A. Veale C.A. Chapdelaine M.J. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1777-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We found that this selective CD45 inhibitor blocked gp120-induced apoptosis of both JE6.1 cells and PBMCs at a concentration of 100 nm (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that expression of full-length CD45 consisting of both the extracellular domain and the intracellular phosphatase domain may be necessary for gp120-mediated apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1998665732,"The signal-transducing protein EIIAGlc, a component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-glucose phosphotransferase system, plays a key role in carbon regulation in enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The phosphorylation state of EIIAGlc governs transport and metabolism of a number of carbohydrates. When glucose as preferred carbon source is transported, EIIAGlc becomes predominantly unphosphorylated and allosterically inhibits several permeases, including the maltose ATP-binding cassette transport system (MalFGK2) in a process termed “inducer exclusion.” We have mapped the binding surface of EIIAGlc that interacts with the MalK subunits by using synthetic cellulose-bound peptide arrays like pep scan- and substitutional analyses. Three regions constituting two binding sites were identified encompassing residues 69-79 (I), 87-91 (II), and 118-127 (III). Region III is MalK-specific, whereas residues from regions I and II partly overlap but are not identical to the binding interfaces for interaction with glycerol kinase and lactose permease. These results were fully verified by studying the inhibitory effect of purified EIIAGlc variants carrying mutations at positions representative of each of the three regions on the ATPase activity of the purified maltose transport complex reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Moreover, a synthetic peptide encompassing residues 69-91 was demonstrated to partially inhibit ATPase activity. We also show for the first time that the N-terminal domain of EIIAGlc is essential for inducer exclusion.

We also show for the first time that the N-terminal domain of EIIAGlc is essential for inducer exclusion. Complex bacterial activities, like those involved in the quest of food, require the coordination of entire metabolic networks. In enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the phosphoenolpyruvate carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) 2The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate carbohydrate phosphotransferase system; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. plays a key role in this process as a signal transduction system (1Lengeler J.W. Jahreis K. Handbook of Biological Physics. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996Google Scholar). The PTS comprises a cascade of protein kinases and phosphocarriers that constitute a series of transport systems, which couple transport and phosphorylation of numerous sugars. The pathway requires the sequential transfer of a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate via EI, HPr to the sugar-specific EII components. “Catabolite repression” allows for the preferential utilization of so-called Class A sugars mostly transported by the PTS, when cells are cultured in the presence of other PTS or non-PTS sugars (Class B). Consequently, the PTS regulates the uptake of Class B-sugars by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. The phosphorylation state of the glucose-specific EIIAGlc component plays a key role in this process. Phosphorylated EIIAGlc is believed to function as an allosteric activator of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, when glucose as a preferred carbon source is transported EIIAGlc becomes predominantly unphosphorylated and inhibits uptake of glycerol, lactose, melibiose, maltose, and other sugars by direct binding to the permeases or glycerol kinase. Thus, at least 10 different proteins have been shown to bind EIIAGlc (2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) largely confirmed this notion. For lactose permease, a biochemical analysis also gave rise to a model that suggests an overlap of the interacting surface of EIIAGlc with that for interaction with other proteins (9Sondej M. Seok Y.J. Badawi P. Koo B.M. Nam T.W. Peterkofsky A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2931-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus far, nothing is known on the binding site by which EIIAGlc interacts with the maltose/maltodextrin ATP-binding cassette transport system. The maltose transport complex (MalFGK2) consists of one copy each of the membrane-integral subunits, MalF and MalG, and two copies of the ATPase subunit, MalK. In addition, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein, MalE, is also required for function (10Schneider E. Holland E.B. Cole S. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: from Bacteria to Man.

Inhibition of maltose transport by EIIAGlc in vivo (2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

The localization of most mutations that render the transporter insensitive to inducer exclusion further indicated that the C-terminal domain of MalK might interact with EIIAGlc (12Dean D.A. Reizer J.

This notion was also confirmed by a study using monoclonal antibodies recognizing C-terminal epitopes on MalK (16Stein A. Seifert M. Volkmer-Engert R. Siepelmeyer J. Jahreis K. Schneider E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4074-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The observation that the intrinsic ATPase activity of the purified MalK subunit is largely insensitive to EIIAGlc suggests that binding of EIIAGlc might interfere with signal transduction during the transport cycle (13Landmesser H. Stein A. Blüschke B. Brinkmann M. Hunke S. Schneider E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here, we identify the binding surface of EIIAGlc that interacts with MalK by employing synthetic peptide arrays in combination with functional analysis of mutant variants at the level of purified proteins. Our results suggest that two binding interfaces exist; one partly overlaps but is not identical to that for interaction with glycerol kinase (4Feese M.D. Comolli L. Meadow N.D. Roseman S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2931-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), whereas the other is unique for MalK. Plasmids—Plasmid pBB04 was constructed by ligating a PCR fragment encompassing the crr gene (encoding enzyme IIAGlc) as an NdeI-BamHI fragment with expression vector pET15b (Novagene). Derivatives of pBB04 carrying single point mutations were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using Stratagene's QuikChange kit. Plasmid pBB06 harboring a crr allele that lacks codons 1-17 was constructed similarly by using a PCR primer introducing an NdeI site (comprising an ATG codon) upstream of codon 17. As a consequence, the translated protein (ΔG1-D16) contains a methionine residue fused to the N terminus of Thr17 of native EIIAGlc. Plasmid pBB07 carrying a crr allele that encodes an EIIA variant lacking the N-terminal residues Gly1-Lys7 was constructed likewise. Preparative Procedures—MalK (17Schmees G. Stein A. Hunke S. Landmesser H. Schneider E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), MalFGK2 (13Landmesser H. Stein A. Blüschke B. Brinkmann M. Hunke S. Schneider E. Biochim.

Subsequent removal of the His tag was carried out by incubation with thrombin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagene). Samples were then passed through PD10 followed by a second passage through Ni-NTA. Tagless enzyme IIAGlc was collected in the flow through. [35S]Methionine labeling of MalK—E. coli strain JM109(pGS91-1) (17Schmees G. Stein A. Hunke S. Landmesser H. Schneider E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (20 ml) was grown in minimal medium E (19Roth J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 3-35Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids (omitting methionine), 2 μg/ml thiamine, 0.5% glucose, 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to A650 = 0.5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 × g, resuspended in preheated fresh medium, and incubated with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 12 min under vigorous shaking. Subsequently, [35S]methionine (250 μCi) was added, and incubation was continued for 5 min. Cells were then cooled on ice for 20 min, harvested by centrifugation as above, washed once with cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and subsequently disrupted by ultrasonication (3× for 1 min with 1-min intervals; output 60%; Branson sonifier). The cytosolic fraction was then recovered by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 × g, and MalK was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography as described elsewhere (17Schmees G. Stein A. Hunke S. Landmesser H. Schneider E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The average specific radioactivity was 5 × 105 cpm/μg MalK. Peptide Synthesis on Cellulose Membranes (SPOT Synthesis)—Cellulose-bound peptide libraries were prepared by semi-automatic SPOT synthesis using a SPOT robot (INTAVIS AG, Köln, Germany). SPOT synthesis was carried out as described in the SPOT synthesis protocol (20Wenschuh H. Gausepohl H. Germeroth L. Ulbricht M. Matuschewski H. Kramer A. Volkmer-Engert R. Heine N. Scharn D. Schneider-Mergener J. Fenniri H. Combinatorial Chemistry, a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 95-116Google Scholar), and arrays were synthesized on modified Whatman 50 cellulose membranes (Whatman, Maidstone, UK). Sequence files and a design of the arrays were generated with the in house software LISA. Peptides derived from S. typhimurium EIIAGlc (accession number AAL 21327) (Gly2-Lys169) were used for pep scan analyses. To this end, three peptide arrays consisting of 13-meric, 16-meric, or 31-meric peptides, overlapping by 12, 15, and 30 amino acids, respectively, were synthesized. Complete substitutional and length analyses of the interacting 16-mer peptides were generated using the software LISA and subsequently synthesized as described (21Volkmer-Engert R. Ehrhard B.

Reineke U. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 188-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Screening of Cellulose Membrane-bound Peptide Arrays—Before screening, the dried membranes were washed for 10 min in ethanol, 3 × 10 min in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl) and subsequently incubated in TBS, supplemented with 5% blocking buffer (Sigma) and 5% sucrose, for 3 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS peptide arrays were incubated with 35S-labeled MalK (105 cpm) in blocking buffer, supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol for 6 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Unbound MalK was removed with TBS, and peptide-bound MalK was visualized and quantified using a phosphoimager and associated software (Fuji, Japan). Peptide Synthesis—Soluble peptides encompassing β-strands 5-7 (T66-IGKIFETNHAFSIESDSGIELFVHFGIDT-V96) or a non-binding region of enzyme IIAGlc (T136-PVVISNMDEIKELIKLSGSVTVGETPVIR-I166) were prepared by automatic solid phase peptide synthesis on a Tentagel-SRam resin (Rapp Polymere, Tübingen, Germany) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Chemical reactions were performed in plastic syringes at room temperature on a multipeptide synthesis robot (Syro2000, MultiSynTech, Witten, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The final peptides were deprotected and cleaved off the resin using a mixture of 10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid, 0.75 g of phenol, 0.5 ml of water, 0.5 ml of methylphenyl sulfide, and 0.25 ml of 1,2-ethanedithiol. After incubation for 3 h at room temperature, the cleavage solution was collected, and the crude peptides were precipitated with dry ether at 0 °C. Purification of the peptides was achieved by high-pressure liquid chromatography on a RP-18 column using a linear solvent gradient (A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water; B, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile; gradient 5-60% B over 30 min). The identity of the purified peptides was validated by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (VoyagerLT, Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) or electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (Q-TOFmicro™, micromass, Manchester, UK). Determination of the Phosphorylation State of Enzyme IIAGlc—The phosphorylation state of enzyme IIAGlc was determined as described (23Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Alba H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The assay takes advantage of the observation that phosphorylation causes a shift of the apparent molecular weight of EIIAGlc on SDS gels. A cytosolic fraction of E. coli strain LS20 (Δcrr::kan) lacking EIIAGlc but containing EI and HPr was prepared from cells grown in minimal medium E (19Roth J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 3-35Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) supplemented with glucose (0.4%), thiamine (2 μg/ml), and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) at 37 °C to an optical density of 1.2. Cells were subsequently harvested and disintegrated by ultrasonication. After centrifugation for 30 min at 200,000 × g the supernatant (cytosol) was stored at -80 °C until use. Assay mixtures (final volume: 30 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5.7 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 67 μm MgCl2, and purified EIIAGlc variants (1 μg) as indicated. The reactions were started by the addition of cytosolic fraction (40 μg of protein) and terminated after 0 and 20 s, respectively, by adding 4 μl of 10 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Subsequently, the solutions were loaded onto 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the blots were incubated with polyclonal anti-EIIAGlc antibody (generous gift of K. Jahreis, Universität Osnabrück, Germany) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antigen-antibody interactions were visualized using the Western blot chemiluminescence reagent plus system (PerkinElmer Life Science products). To determine the time dependence of EIIAGlc phosphorylation, the mixtures (140 μl) contained 200 μg of cytosolic fraction of LS20 and 5 μg of EIIAGlc variants. Aliquots (15 μl) were taken at the indicated times and further treated as described above. Analytical Procedures—ATPase assay, protein determination, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as described elsewhere (16Stein A. Seifert M. Volkmer-Engert R. Siepelmeyer J. Jahreis K. Schneider E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4074-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Screening of EIIAGlc-derived Peptide Arrays for Binding to MalK—To determine the binding motif within EIIAGlc recognized by MalK, we screened cellulose-bound peptide arrays synthesized by SPOT-synthesis and representing the complete EIIAGlc sequence (Gly1-Lys168) for MalK binding. According to the convention adopted for E. coli IIAGlc in the literature (2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

Herzberg O. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10382-10386Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the N-terminal methionine, which can be hydrolyzed, is numbered as zero throughout the manuscript. The peptide arrays consisted of 13-mers, 16-mers, or 31-mers that overlapped with adjacent peptides by 12, 15, and 30 amino acids, respectively. The cellulose membranes were incubated with 35S-labeled MalK and washed to remove excess label, and the retained radioactivity was visualized by phosphoimaging. Signals were consistently obtained with all three arrays in four rows but with different intensities (Fig. 1). Strongest signals were observed in rows 2 and 3, whereas the signal in row 1 was rather weak. The reliability of the data was further confirmed by probing three independently synthesized peptide arrays consisting of 16-mers. Each membrane gave the same signals with similar intensities (data not shown). Substitutional and Length Analyses—To identify those amino acid residues within each peptide that are indispensable for binding of MalK, substitutional analyses of the peptides from signal rows 1-3 were performed (signal row 4 was suspected to result from an unspecific reaction possibly due to the positive charges at the C-terminal end of the protein and was thus not further studied, but see Fig. 7B). In these experiments every position was substituted one-at-a-time by all other genetically encoded amino acids. Thus, all possible single site substitution analogs were synthesized and screened. The results shown in Fig. 2 represent data obtained for spots 64 (A), 80 (B), and 112 (C) of the initial 16-mers array (see Fig. 1, center panel). Basically the same discrete substitution patterns were identified with 31-mers (not shown). The signal intensities obtained with the wild type sequence of each peptide (Fig. 2, left columns) correlated with those seen in Fig. 1. Thus, at least in case of Fig. 2A, the spots were somewhat difficult to detect on a printout. However, close inspection of the images on the computer screen clearly revealed individual residues on each membrane that could not be replaced by any other amino acid without affecting binding of MalK.FIGURE 2Substitutional analyses of peptides recognized by MalK. Each amino acid of the peptides (16-mers) corresponding to spots 64, 80, and 112 in Fig. 1, center panel (indicated at the left-hand side of each membrane), is substituted by all other 20 l-amino acids in alphabetical order (shown on top of each membrane) and tested for binding of MalK as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All spots in the left column comprise the wild type (Wt) sequence of the peptides. Amino acids important for binding are underlined. A, spot 64, D64-GTIGKIFETNHAFS-I79; B, spot 80, E80-SDSGIELFVHFGID-T95; C, R112-VKVGDPVIEFDLPL-L127.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also determined the minimal length of a peptide required to bind MalK. To this end, 16-mers and 31-mers were shortened sequentially from the N- and C-terminal end down to 10-mers and 16-mers, respectively (not shown). The combined results identified the peptides comprising amino acids 69 -79 (KIFETNHAFSI) (region 1), 87-91 (LFVHF) (region 2), and 118-127 (PVIEFDLPLL) (region 3) as being crucial for MalK binding (Fig. 3). None of the hydrophobic residues (underlined) can be replaced by amino acids with charged or polar side chains without loss of binding, suggesting that the binding interface is largely hydrophobic. Regions 1 and 2 basically encompass β-strands 5-7 of enzyme IIAGlc, which have also been implicated in recognizing other target proteins (4Feese M.D. Comolli L. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Remington S.J.

However, the binding sites are not identical and, most importantly, region 3, located on the opposite face of the β-sandwich (Fig. 4), appears to be unique for binding MalK. Lys69 represents the only critically charged residue for interaction with MalK. Interestingly enough, hydrophobic residues substituted for Lys69 are tolerated, whereas negatively charged and some polar uncharged residues (Gln, Pro, Asn, Met) caused a loss of binding (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 4The structure of EIIAGlc. Space-fill representation of EIIAGlc was drawn with DS ViewerPro 6.0 (Accelrys, Cambridge, UK) using the coordinates from 1F3G in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank.

The catalytic His90 (underlined)is shown in green.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutational Analysis of Selected Residues of EIIAGlc—The results described above suggested that amino acid residues encompassing part of β5, β6, and β7 as well as of β11 and α2 of EIIAGlc are crucial for binding of MalK. To verify these predictions in the context of the folded protein we monitored ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the reconstituted MalFGK2 complex in the presence of purified EIIAGlc variants. To this end, variants of EIIAGlc carrying substitutions of residues from all three peptide regions involved in binding were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”). In particular, residues representing regions 1 (Lys69, Phe71) and 2 (Phe88, Phe91) were replaced by glutamine and phenylalanine, predicted by substitutional analyses (Fig. 2) to either eliminate or allow binding of MalK. Similarly, residues representing region 3 were changed to isoleucine and glutamine (Phe122) or threonine (Leu127). Moreover, Arg165 and Lys167 from the C-terminal end (signal row 4, Fig. 1) were also included. Each variant could be overproduced in soluble form comparable to wild type and was purified accordingly. Furthermore, after purification the N-terminal His tag was removed from each mutant protein to exclude possible artifacts by unspecific interaction (Fig. 5A). As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, and in agreement with a previous study (13Landmesser H. Stein A. Blüschke B. Brinkmann M. Hunke S. Schneider E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), wild type EIIAGlc when added in a 20-25-fold molar excess substantially inhibited the MalE-maltose-stimulated ATPase activity of MalFGK2-containing proteoliposomes. In comparison, the degree of inhibition displayed by the variants exactly confirmed the above predictions. Glutamine substituting for residues from regions 1 and 2 (Lys69, Phe71, Phe88, Phe91) caused a loss of inhibition (Fig. 6A), whereas replacement by tyrosine (where tested) had no or only little effect on the inhibitory potential (Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained with variants carrying mutations in region 3. Although the F122I mutant protein still caused some inhibition, variants carrying F122Q or L127T mutations completely failed to inhibit the ATPase activity of MalFGK2 (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, mutations of the C-terminal residues Arg165 and Lys167 had no effect on the capability of the variants to inhibit ATPase activity (Fig. 7B). This result is consistent with the above notion that the C-terminal portion of the protein is not involved in the interaction with MalK. To exclude that the mutations, in particular those that caused loss of inhibition, might have affected EIIAGlc integrity, we analyzed the ability of the variants to accept a phosphoryl group from HPr in vitro. The assay is based on the observation that phosphorylated EIIAGlc is migrating slower in SDS gels than its unphosphorylated form (23Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Alba H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 6 and 7 (C and D) all variants behaved like the wild type, whereas a control carrying a mutation of the catalytic His90 residue (→A) failed to become phosphorylated. Thus, we conclude that none of the mutations affected the structural integrity of EIIAGlc. Interestingly, the H90"

Unlike many GPCRs, agonist-induced internalization of the IP occurs in an arrestin/GPCR kinase-independent manner. However, deletion of the IP COOH-terminal region prevented internalization suggesting that protein interactions at this region are involved in IP regulation. Using the COOH-terminal region of IP as bait we identified the δ subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6δ) as a novel hIP-interacting protein in two independent yeast two-hybrid screens. Interaction of IP and PDE6δ was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells, and in HEPG2 cells, which endogenously express neither IP nor PDE6δ. IP isoprenylation was critical for this interaction, as PDE6δ was unable to associate with an isoprenylation-deficient mutant IP (IPSSLC). PDE6δ overexpression altered the temporal pattern of agonist-induced internalization of IP, but not IPSSLC, in HEPG2 cells, increasing initial internalization but facilitating the return of IP to the cell surface despite the continued presence of agonist. Depletion of PDE6δ using short interfering RNA abolished cicaprost-induced IP internalization in human aortic smooth muscle cells. Recycling of IP, but not IPSSLC, upon agonist removal was facilitated by overexpression of PDE6δ. Thus PDE6δ interacts specifically with IP to modulate receptor trafficking.

Austin S.C. Rocca B. Koller B.H. Coffman T.M. Grosser T. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Science. 2002; 296: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and during atherogenesis (2Kobayashi T. Tahara Y. Matsumoto M. Iguchi M. Sano H. Murayama T. Arai H. Oida H. Yurugi-Kobayashi T. Yamashita J.K. Katagiri H. Majima M. Yokode M. Kita T. Narumiya S. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Indeed the cardiovascular hazard associated recently with selective inhibitors of COX-2, such as rofecoxib, celebcoxib, and valdecoxib, has been ascribed to the depression of PGI2 biosynthesis, concurrent with unrestricted TxA2 generation (3Wong D. Wang M. Cheng Y. FitzGerald G.A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).PGI2 mediates its effects through the membrane-associated receptor IP, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Signaling by this family of receptors is tightly regulated. In the canonical regulatory pathway the activated receptor is phosphorylated by one or more GPCR kinases (GRKs) followed by recruitment of an adapter protein, arrestin. These events culminate in rapid uncoupling of the receptor from its G protein (desensitization) and subsequent receptor internalization (4Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Once internalized the receptor may be dephosphorylated and recycled to the cell surface, restoring rapidly agonist activation, or undergo lysosomal degradation resulting in receptor down-regulation and a sustained loss of responsiveness (4Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). While the regulatory mechanisms employed by many GPCRs adhere, to a reasonable degree, to this pathway, we (5Smyth E.M. Austin S.C. Reilly M.P. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Thus rapid desensitization of activated IP occurs secondary to it's phosphorylation, not by a GRK but by a second messenger activated kinase, PKC (6Smyth E.M. Li W.H. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23258-23266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Subsequently the IP is internalized through a phosphorylation- and arrestin-independent pathway (5Smyth E.M. Austin S.C. Reilly M.P. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32037-32045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Nilius S.M. Hasse A. Kuger P. Schror K. Meyer-Kirchrath J.

Rapid recycling of the sequestered IP upon agonist withdrawal, which restores the response to agonist without the need for de novo protein synthesis, is evident in platelets (8Fisch A. Tobusch K. Veit K. Meyer J. Darius H. Circulation. 1997; 96: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), fibroblasts (7Nilius S.M. Hasse A. Kuger P. Schror K. Meyer-Kirchrath J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and transfected HEK293 cells (5Smyth E.M. Austin S.C. Reilly M.P. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32037-32045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).The molecular pathways, therefore, that direct agonist-dependent trafficking of IP remain ill-defined but diverge substantially from the classical GPCR regulatory pathway. Deletion of the IP COOH-terminal tail abolished its rapid agonist-dependent receptor internalization (5Smyth E.M. Austin S.C. Reilly M.P. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32037-32045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) suggesting that key regulatory interactions occur along this portion of the protein. Using the COOH-terminal region of the IP as bait, we isolated a specific IP-interacting protein, in vascular smooth muscle cells, which was identified as the δ subunit of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 6 enzyme complex. This protein was originally identified as the fourth subunit of rod-specific cGMP PDE6 (11Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13516-13523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In that system the interaction of PDE6δ with the isoprenylated COOH termini of the enzymes α and β catalytic subunits leads to their solubilization from the plasma membrane and uncoupling of PDE6 from its effector, transducin (12Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5248-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), in addition to potentially regulating intracellular trafficking of newly synthesized PDE6 (13Norton A.W.

The functional importance of PDE6δ appears, however, to extend beyond both retinal tissue and the PDE6 enzymatic complex with which it was first associated. Unlike the other subunits, widespread expression of PDE6δ in extraretinal tissue, including heart, placenta, lung, and brain (14Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), has been reported. This, along with its marked conservation throughout evolution (15Marzesco A.M. Galli T. Louvard D. Zahraoui A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), suggests a broader role in cellular signaling. Indeed, several groups have reported the interaction of PDE6δ with a established cell signaling molecules, including members of the Ras superfamily of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (16Nancy V. Callebaut I. El Marjou A. de Gunzburg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and the α subunit of at least one heterotrimeric G protein Gi, leading to their translocation into the cytosol (17Hanzal-Bayer M. Renault L. Roversi P. Wittinghofer A. Hillig R.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is apparent that PDE6δ can act in a manner similar to guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, to inhibit Rap and Ras signaling (16Nancy V. Callebaut I. El Marjou A. de Gunzburg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), while conversely acting as an effector for, or functional component of, signaling via Arl1, Arl2, and Arl3 (17Hanzal-Bayer M.

The yeast strain YRG2 (Stratagene) transformed with this hIP-CTER bait was used to screen a Gal4 activation domain fusion cDNA library from human (h) aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (ASMC; Biowhittaker Inc., Walkersville, MD), prepared as described previously (20McNamara P. Seo S.P. Rudic R.D. Sehgal A. Chakravarti D. FitzGerald G.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Interacting clones were selected on media lacking the amino acids Trp, Leu, and His, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Background His reporter expression was inhibited with 3-aminotriazol (3-AT), to titrate out the number of false positives. LacZ expression in surviving colonies was inferred from β-galactosidase activity, assayed, as described (20McNamara P. Seo S.P. Rudic R.D. Sehgal A. Chakravarti D. FitzGerald G.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), in a colony filter lift assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside as substrate. The cDNAs from LacZ-positive clones were sequenced across the Gal4/library cDNA boundary and analyzed using the BLAST algorithm at the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).Construct Generation and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Primers were designed to mutate Cys383 to Ser383 (sense oligonucleotide: 5′ GCC AGC GTC GCC AGC TCC CTC TGC TGA TGG ATC C), in the hIP, triple tagged (3x) at its amino terminus with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (obtained from the University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center). Mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange II site-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutated receptor was termed IPSSLC reflecting the change in the amino acid sequence of the last four amino acids of hIP from CSLC to SSLC. Mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing.To generate PDE6δ tagged at its carboxyl terminus with a V5 (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) epitope tag, the stop codon was removed from PDE6δ by PCR using a sense oligonucleotide containing three miscellaneous bases, followed by the sequence encoding the first five amino acids in the hPDE6δ sequence (5′-ATC ATG TCA GCC AAG GAC). The antisense oligonucleotide was complimentary to the coding sequence for the six amino acids preceding the stop codon (5′-AAC ATA GAA AAG TCT CAC). The resulting PCR product, encoding the full-length PDE6δ absent its stop codon, was cloned directly in pcDNA3.1/V5-His, using the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression kit (Invitrogen), to allow expression of the PDE6δ-V5 fusion protein.hIP and hTPα, tagged at their amino termini with a single copy of HA, and cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), were generated as described previously (21Wilson S.J. Roche A.M. Kostetskaia E. Smyth E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53036-53047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells (American Type Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 mm HEPES, and 2 mm l-glutamine. HEPG2 cells (American Type Tissue Culture Collection) were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, sodium pyruvate (100 μm), and non-essential amino acids (110 μg/ml). hASMC (Biowhittaker Inc.) were cultured in smooth muscle cell basal medium supplemented with FBS (5%), human recombinant epidermal growth factor (0.5 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), human recombinant fibroblast growth factor (2 ng/ml) plus gentamicin (50 μg/ml) and amphotericin-B (50 ng/ml). hASMC of passage numbers 7-9 were used in experiments. All cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air.HEK293 and HEPG2 cells grown to 50-80% confluence in 100-mm dishes were transfected transiently using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were carried out 48 h post-transfection. In control co-transfections DNA levels were equalized with empty vector.siRNA Transfection— hASMC grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 100 μm control (Ambion, Austin, TX) or PDE6δ-targeting (SMARTpool; Dharmacon RNA Technology, Lafayette, CO) siRNA using the DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon RNA Technology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with siRNA-containing medium for 48 h, transferred to 12-well plates, and grown for a further 48 h prior to assay.Western Blotting—whole cell lysates were resolved (30 μg per lane) on NuPAGE (Invitrogen) 10% gels. HA-tagged receptors were visualized with anti-HA (Covance, 1:1000 dilution), in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.6), containing 1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), for 1 h at room temperature followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch), after first blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. Similarly, V5-tagged or native PDE6δ was detected using anti-V5-HRP (Invitrogen, 1:5000) or anti-PDE6δ (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were treated with 2 mm dithio-bis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) for 30 min, to cross-link covalently surface proteins, and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) for 10 min at 4 °C prior to centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting supernatants were precleared by 1-h rotation with 50 μlof 10% (w/v) protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) to each tube. Anti-HA-protein G-Sepharose was prepared by adding 5 μg anti-HA ascites per lysate to 10% protein G-Sepharose followed by 1-h rotation. HAhIP or HAhTPα was immunoprecipitated, from precleared lysates, by adding 100 μl of anti-HA-protein G-Sepharose to each lysate and rotating for 16 h at 4 °C. Protein G was precipitated at 14,000 rpm for 1 min, washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and resuspended in 10 μl of sample buffer (NuPAGE). Immunobloting for co-immunoprecipitated V5-PDE6δ was carried out, as described above.Measurement of Cell Surface HAhIP—Surface expression was measured by ELISA, as described previously (5Smyth E.M. Austin S.C. Reilly M.P. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32037-32045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, cells seeded on 24-well dishes were treated with the agent of interest at 37 °C and reactions stopped by aspiration and fixation (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 4 °C, 10-15 min). HA expression was quantified by incubation with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:1000 dilution in PBS) followed by alkaline peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:10,000 dilution in PBS) for 30 min. Cell surface alkaline phosphatase was detected, after four washes with PBS, following conversion of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate by measurement of absorbance at 405 nm.Binding Studies—Cell surface IP was examined in hASMC by radioligand binding to intact cells. Indomethacin (3 μm)-pretreated hASMC were incubated with a saturating concentration (50 nm) of [3H]iloprost, an IP agonist, in binding buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence or absence of excess (10 μm) unlabeled iloprost for 18 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times in ice-cold buffer, treated with 1 m NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C and cell-associated radioactivity quantified.cAMP Measurements—HEPG2 cells grown to confluence in 12-well plates were pretreated with isobutylmethylxanthine (0.01 m) 30 min prior to agonist addition. Cells were treated and reactions were terminated by aspiration. cAMP was extracted with ice-cold 65% ethanol for 30 min. Samples were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in assay buffer, and cAMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay as described previously (22Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).RESULTSYeast Two-hybrid Screen—The COOH terminus of hIP (hIP-CTER) was used as bait in a hASMC cDNA library yeast two-hybrid screen. Eleven β-galactosidase-positive clones, which grew in the absence of His/Leu/Tryp and presence of 5 mm 3-AT, were identified. Analysis of the DNA sequences revealed that each encoded the same 150 amino acid protein; two independent clones were identified, 9 were identical. BLAST analysis revealed an exact match with a 17-kDa protein identified as the δ subunit of PDE6, a cGMP PDE (23Li N. Florio S.K. Pettenati M.J. Rao P.N. Beavo J.A. Baehr W. Genomics. 1998; 49: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These findings were confirmed in a second independent screen, carried out at lower stringency (2.5 mm 3-AT). The coding sequence of PDE6δ was cloned, minus its stop codon, into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His to generate the PDE6δ-V5 fusion protein.The interaction of hIP with PDE6δ was confirmed using HEK293 transected transiently with PDE6δ-V5 and co-transfected with or without HAhIP. Lysates, subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, were examined for the presence of PDE6δ by immunoblotting with anti-V5. PDE6δ was co-immunoprecipitated only when both proteins were co-expressed (Fig. 1C, lane 5). In contrast, PDE6δ-V5 was not evident in anti-HA precipitated lysates prepared from HAhTPα/PDE6δ-V5 co-transfected cells (Fig. 1C, lane 6) confirming that the interaction was specific to hIP and was not due to the presence of HA or V5 epitope tags.Screening for Endogenous PDE6δ Expression—Widespread expression of PDE6δ has been reported (14Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of PDE6δ in modulating IP function, we first sought to identify a suitable cell model for ectopic PDE6δ expression. Of the several commonly used cell types screened by Western blot for endogenous PDE6δ expression, HEPG2 cells were found to express negligible levels of protein (Fig. 2A). Furthermore IP expression also was absent in HEPG2 cells, as determined by cAMP accumulation in response to treatment with the IP agonist cicaprost (data not shown). As such, HEPG2 cells represent an ideal cell model to determine the functional consequence of IP-PDE6δ interaction. HEPG2 cells were transfected with PDE6δ-V5 with or without 3xHAhIP and their interaction confirmed by co-immmunoprecipitation (Fig. 2D, lane 1).FIGURE 2Isoprenylation as a requirement for IP-PDE6δ interaction. A, cell lysates derived from NIH3T3, HeLa, COS-7, and HEK293 and HEPG2 cells were resolved by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE and endogenous PDE6δ detected using an anti-PDE6δ antibody, as described under “Experimental procedures.” Cell lysates derived from HEPG2 cells co-transfected with V5-PDE6δ plus either empty vector (pcDNA3), 3xHAhIP, or the isoprenylation-deficient 3xHAhIPSSLC mutant were resolved by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE and expression of 3xHAhIP and 3xHAhIPSSLC (B) or V5-PDE6δ (C) confirmed. D, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody and co-immunoprecipitated V5-PDE6δ detected using an anti-V5-HRP antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation of V5-PDE6δ was only observed when 3xHAhIP and V5-PDE6δ were co-expressed (arrow). Western blots are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Isoprenylation as a Requirement for IP-PDE6δ Interaction—Interaction between PDE6δ and the majority of its binding partners is dependent on their isoprenylation (11Cook T.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The IP is one of the very few GPCRs that contains a conserved “CAAX” motif, Cys383-Ser-Leu-Cys386, for isoprenylation in its COOH-terminal tail. Indeed addition of C15-farnesyl isoprenoid groups to the IP has been reported. Moreover this modification was appeared critical for both IP signaling and efficient agonist-dependent sequestration (24Miggin S.M. Lawler O.A. Kinsella B.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1714-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether the IP-PDE6δ interaction was dependent on IP isoprenylation, we generated an isoprenylation-deficient IP receptor (IPSSLC) in which Cys383, a critical residue within the isoprenylation motif, was mutated to Ser (24Miggin S.M. Lawler O.A. Kinsella B.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1714-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Interaction of IPSSLC with PDE6δ was examined in HEPG2 cells transfected transiently with PDE6δ-V5 and co-transfected with 3xHAhIP or IPSSLC. PDE6δ was co-immunoprecipitated from HEPG2 cells co-expressing 3xHAhIP but not from cells co-expressing the isoprenylation-deficient IP mutant or those expressing PDE6δ alone (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that similar to many other PDE6δ interactors, IP isoprenylation was required for its interaction with PDE6δ. Concordantly, treatment of cells with lovastatin (20 μm), which inhibits IP isoprenylation (25Hayes J.S. Lawler O.A. Walsh M.T. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23707-23718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), also prevented IP-PDE6δ interaction (data not shown).Effect of PDE6δ Overexpression on IP-mediated cAMP Generation— Impaired effector activation via IPSSLC has been demonstrated (24Miggin S.M. Lawler O.A. Kinsella B.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1714-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) leading those authors to conclude that isoprenylation of IP was critical for its coupling to downstream G proteins. The dependence of the IP-PDE6δ interaction on IP isoprenylation led us to examine whether PDE6δ modulates IP signaling. HEPG2 cells, transfected with 3xHAhIP with or without PDE6δ, were stimulated with the prostacyclin analogue cicaprost for 5 min. A robust concentration-dependent increase in cAMP was observed in response to IP activation (EC50 = 0.11 ± 0.06 nm, n = 3). Overexpression of PDE6δ did not alter significantly IP-mediated cAMP generation (EC50 = 0.1 ± 0.06 nm, n = 3). In a similar manner IP-cAMP signaling was unaltered when IP-transfected HEK293 cells were co-transfected with PDE6δ-V5 (data not shown). Thus, the interaction with PDE6δ was not responsible for the signaling deficit associated ablation of IP isoprenylation (24Miggin S.M. Lawler O.A. Kinsella B.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1714-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Role of PDE6δ in IP Sequestration—Although the precise function of PDE6δ remains unknown, its interaction with proteins such as the α and β subunits of PDE6, and the small G protein Rab13, resulted in their translocation from the membrane to the cytosol. We (5Smyth E.M. Austin S.C. Reilly M.P. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32037-32045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and others (7Nilius S.M. Hasse A. Kuger P. Schror K. Meyer-Kirchrath J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have reported that sequestration of activated IP does not operate through the classical phosphorylation/arrestin-dependent pathway associated with GPCRs. Indeed, while the pathways that direct IP trafficking remain ill-defined, a COOH-terminal truncated IP was not internalized following activation with agonist (5Smyth E.M. Austin S.C. Reilly M.P. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32037-32045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to a phosphorylation-deficient IP mutant (6Smyth E.M. Li W.H. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23258-23266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), sequestration of the isoprenylation deficient IPSSLC mutant markedly was impaired (24Miggin S.M. Lawler O.A. Kinsella B.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1714-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for isoprenylation in IP trafficking. The involvement of PDE6δ in IP internalization was assessed in HEPG2 cells transfected with 3xHAhIP with or without PDE6δ-V5. IP internalization in response to cicaprost (1 μm) occurred more rapidly in HEPG2 cells overexpressing PDE6δ; 15 min after agonist activation cell surface expression of 3xHAhIP was reduced to only 87.6 ± 6.6% of control in 3xHAhIP t"
