https://openalex.org/W2160412430,"Adipose tissue produces inflammation and immunity molecules suspected to be involved in obesity-related complications. The pattern of expression and the nutritional regulation of these molecules in humans are poorly understood. We analyzed the gene expression profiles of subcutaneous white adipose tissue from 29 obese subjects during very low calorie diet (VLCD) using cDNA microarray and reverse transcription quantitative PCR. The patterns of expression were compared with that of 17 non-obese subjects. We determined whether the regulated genes were expressed in adipocytes or stromavascular fraction cells. Gene expression profiling identified 100 inflammation-related transcripts that are regulated in obese individuals when eating a 28 day VLCD but not a 2 day VLCD. Cluster analysis showed that the pattern of gene expression in obese subjects after 28 day VLCD was closer to the profile of lean subjects than to the pattern of obese subjects before VLCD. Weight loss improves the inflammatory profile of obese subjects through a decrease of proinflammatory factors and an increase of anti-inflammatory molecules. The genes are expressed mostly in the stromavascular fraction of adipose tissue, which is shown to contain numerous macrophages. The beneficial effect of weight loss on obesity-related complications may be associated with the modification of the inflammatory profile in adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1978272694,"Our previous studies have clearly shown that the angiogenic enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2/9, are directly involved in human hepatic tumorigenesis and metastasis and suggest that the MMP-2/9 inhibitors, which have dual inhibitory activities on enzyme activity and transcription, represent the best candidates for achieving tumor regression. Many anti-cancer drugs have strong cellular cytotoxicity and side effects, indicating that strong anti-cancer drugs that have no or minimal cytotoxicity and side effects need to be developed. The specific aim of the present study was to develop powerful anti-cancer drugs with specific tumor regression and anti-metastatic potential having the dual inhibitory activities of specific MMP-2 and -9 enzyme activities and gene transcription at the molecular level. Caffeic acid (CA), a strong and selective MMP-9 activity and transcription inhibitor, was isolated from the plant Euonymus alatus and its derivative, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), was synthesized. CA and CAPE selectively inhibited MMP-2 and -9 but not -1, -3, -7, or cathepsin K. Treatment of HepG2 cells with CA (100 microg/mL) and CAPE (5 microg/mL) suppressed phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) -induced MMP-9 expression by inhibiting the function of NF-kappaB, but not AP-1. We confirmed that CA and CAPE suppressed the growth of HepG2 tumor xenografts in nude mice in vivo. The subcutaneous and oral administrations of CA and CAPE significantly reduced the liver metastasis. These results confirm the therapeutic potential of the compounds and suggest that the anti-metastatic and anti-tumor effects of CA and CAPE are mediated through the selective suppression of MMP-9 enzyme activity and transcriptional down-regulation by the dual inhibition of NF-kappaB as well as MMP-9 catalytic activity."

Each two-component system consists of a sensor protein-histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR), together forming a signal transduction pathway via histidyl-aspartyl phospho-relay. A total of 30 sensor HKs, including as yet uncharacterized putative HKs (BaeS, BasS, CreC, CusS, HydH, RstB, YedV, and YfhK), and a total of 34 RRs, including putative RRs (BaeR, BasR, CreB, CusR, HydG, RstA, YedW, YfhA, YgeK, and YhjB), have been suggested to exist in Escherichia coli. We have purified the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of 27 sensor HKs and the full-length protein of all 34 RRs to apparent homogeneity. Self-phosphorylation in vitro was detected for 25 HKs. The rate of self-phosphorylation differed among HKs, whereas the level of phosphorylation was generally co-related with the phosphorylation rate. However, the phosphorylation level was low for ArcB, HydH, NarQ, and NtrB even though the reaction rate was fast, whereas the level was high for the slow phosphorylation species BasS, CheA, and CreC. By using the phosphorylated HKs, we examined trans-phosphorylation in vitro of RRs for all possible combinations. Trans-phosphorylation of presumed cognate RRs by HKs was detected, for the first time, for eight pairs, BaeS-BaeR, BasS-BasR, CreC-CreB, CusS-CusR, HydH-HydG, RstB-RstA, YedV-YedW, and YfhK-YfhA. All trans-phosphorylation took place within less than 1/2 min, but the stability of phosphorylated RRs differed, indicating the involvement of de-phosphorylation control. In addition to the trans-phosphorylation between the cognate pairs, we detected trans-phosphorylation between about 3% of non-cognate HK-RR pairs, raising the possibility that the cross-talk in signal transduction takes place between two-component systems.

The two-component system (TCS) 1The abbreviations used are: TCS, two-component system; HK, histidine kinase; RR, response regulator; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: TCS, two-component system; HK, histidine kinase; RR, response regulator; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. is the signal transduction pathway widely employed from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Typically, TCS is composed of a sensor that monitors an external signal(s) and a response regulator that controls gene expression or other physiological activities such as chemotaxis (1Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In bacteria, TCS is the major system of signal transduction but not in Archaea and eukaryotes (2Egger L.A. Park H. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Most of the sensors of bacterial TCS are membrane-associated histidine kinase (HK). The sensor phosphorylates its own conserved His residue in response to a signal(s) in the environment. The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic region of HK, called transmitter domain, consists of an ATP-binding domain and a so-called H box domain that includes the conserved His residue for self-phosphorylation. Subsequently, the His-bound phosphoryl group of HK is transferred onto a specific Asp residue on the cognate response regulator (RR) for activation. The activated RR activates, in most cases, transcription of a set of genes, which respond to the external signal.On the basis of Escherichia coli genome sequence, a total of 30 HK, each containing the conserved self-phosphorylation domain, and a total of 32 RR, each containing the conserved receiver domain, have been predicted (3Mizuno T. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). After detailed analysis of the genome sequence, two additional RR candidates, YgeK and YhjB, have been identified, both containing the conserved helix-turn-helix motif of the RR family. 2N. Fujita, personal communication.2N. Fujita, personal communication. Recently, Oshima et al. (4Oshima T. Aiba H. Masuda Y. Kanaya S. Sugiura M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) performed a microarray analysis for a total of 30 TCS mutants of E. coli and speculated that, at least for certain combinations, TCSs functionally interact each other to expand the signal transduction network so as to allow some genes to respond to various signals in the environment (4Oshima T. Aiba H. Masuda Y. Kanaya S. Sugiura M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To examine the specificity of HK-RR interaction in a more direct way, we have purified as many HK and RR proteins as possible, and we tested the self-phosphorylation of HK and the trans-phosphorylation of RR by phosphorylated HK in all possible combinations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—To construct plasmids for overproduction of the cytoplasmic region of each HK containing the HK catalytic domain and the full-length RR, the corresponding DNA fragments were prepared by PCR using E. coli W3110 genome DNA as template and a set of primer pairs (for sequence see supplemental Table I). After digestion of the PCR-amplified fragments with two kinds of the restriction enzyme, each introducing a single cleavage within one of the primer pairs (for sequence see supplemental Table I), the PCR-amplified fragments were inserted into pET21a(+) vector (Novagen) between the same restriction sites as used for the preparation of insert DNAs. All the plasmids thus constructed (supplemental Table II) were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Protein Expression—To achieve high level expression of the target proteins, each plasmid was transformed into three different competent E. coli cells, two IPTG-inducible strains, BL21(DE3) and JM109(DE3), and one salt-inducible strain BL21(SI) and selected for one strain showing the maximum induction level among the three test strains. For large scale protein production, each transformant was grown in 200 ml of LB broth and at 0.8–0.9 of A600; IPTG was added to BL21(DE3) and JM109(DE3) cultures at the final concentration of 1 mm, or NaCl was added to BL21(SI) culture at the final concentration of 0.3 m. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 °C, and 100 mm NaCl), and then stored at -80 °C until use.Protein Purification—Frozen cells were suspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer containing 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After addition of 80 μl of lysozyme (10 mg/ml), the cell suspension was stored on ice for 30 min and then lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose suspension (Qiagen) and loaded onto a column. After washing with 10 ml of lysis buffer, the column was washed with 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X. The His-tagged HK or RR protein was then eluted with 2 ml each of lysis buffer containing 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5 m imidazole. The recovery and purity of HK or RR protein in each eluate were checked by SDS-PAGE. The purified HK or RR protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 4 °C, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol). The protein concentration was determined by the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and the purity was checked by SDS-PAGE.Self-phosphorylation of HK—The purified HK was diluted to 1 μm with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 37 °C, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2), and the phosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at a final concentration of 2.5 μm. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for various times and terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4 °C, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). After SDS-PAGE, the gel was washed with 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed onto an image plate. The intensity of each band on the image plate was measured with BAS1000 (Fuji Film Co., Japan).Trans-phosphorylation of RR by HK—The phosphorylated form of HK (1 μm) prepared as above was mixed on ice with a mixture of RR (1 μm) and excess cold ATP (0.5 mm) and then incubated at 37 °C for various times. The reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was washed with 45% methanol, 10% acetate, dried, and exposed onto an image plate. The intensity of each gel band was measured with BAS1000 (Fuji Film Co.).RESULTSPurification of TCS Components—For in vitro analysis of HK-RR interactions, we tried to purify a total of 64 E. coli TCS components (30 HKs plus HK candidates and 34 RRs plus RR candidates including the newly identified YgeK and YhjB) in His6-tagged forms from overexpressed E. coli. The sensor HK is generally composed of two domains, the amino-terminal membrane-associated domain for monitoring an external signal(s) and the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain with catalytic function of His phosphorylation. Because the signal molecules for HK activation are not yet identified for some sensors, we decided to purify the cytoplasmic HK domain, which alone retains the activity of autophosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation to the cognate RR in the absence of the effector-binding domain (5Abo-Amer A.E.

Yamada M. Nakata A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The coding sequences for the carboxyl-terminal domain for all 30 sensor HKs or HK candidates with the His6 tag sequence at the carboxyl terminus were PCR-amplified using sets of primer pairs (for sequence see supplemental Table I) and were inserted into pET21a(+) to generate the respective expression plasmids (see supplemental Table II). The expression plasmids for 30 RRs and RR candidates were also constructed in the same procedure by using PCR-amplified coding sequences. Expression plasmids for four RRs, CitB, RssB, NtrC, and CreB, were constructed from the respective green fluorescent protein fusion-type Archive clones (16Mori H. Isono K. Horiuchi T. Miki T. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) after digestion with NotI for removal of the green fluorescent protein portion. In these cases, the His6 tag sequence is added at the amino terminus of each RR coding sequence.To achieve the maximum level of protein induction, we first checked the expression level by using three different competent strains, IPTG-inducible BL21(DE3) and JM109(DE3) and salt-inducible BL21(SI), and under various induction conditions with respect to the inducer concentration and the induction time. The host strain and the best conditions for maximum expression differed from protein to protein (data not shown). Three HK proteins, RcsC, YpdA (B2380), and QseC, were not induced in all the hosts used and under all the conditions tested. Except for these three HK proteins, 61 other proteins (27 HKs and 34 RRs) were subjected to large scale expression and purification. Most of the proteins were recovered in soluble fractions and purified to apparent homogeneity by a single step of affinity chromatography. Two HK proteins (AtoS and YehU) and one RR protein (FimZ) were recovered in pellet fractions after centrifugation and thus solubilized in lysis buffer containing 7 m urea. For these proteins, urea was removed after protein purification by dialyzing against storage buffer without urea. As a result, a total of 61 proteins, 27 truncated form HKs and 34 full-length RR, were purified, all of which apparently showed a single band on SDS-PAGE (data not shown).Self-phosphorylation of HKs—A total of 27 purified HK was subjected to self-phosphorylation in the presence of radioactive ATP. As shown in Fig. 1, 25 species of the purified HK showed the self-phosphorylation activity, but a detectable level of phosphorylation was not observed for two HKs, CitA and YojN. The YojN protein is not an orthodox-type sensor because it lacks the conserved catalytic domain of His kinase, whereas the lack of self-phosphorylation activity for CitA is not yet clear. For all 25 catalytically active HKs, the self-phosphorylation took place rapidly, and the maximum level of phosphorylation was observed within 30 min. The phosphorylation level did not increase after prolonged incubation for up to 2 h (data not shown). The level of phosphorylation, however, decreased after addition of unlabeled ATP (see below), indicating that the self-phosphorylation of HK is a reversible reaction. The dissociation of radioactive phosphorus was also observed even in the absence of ATP. These observations suggest that the HKs used in this study were de-phosphorylated during purification and after prolonged storage in the absence of ATP.The saturation level of self-phosphorylation at equilibrium ranged from less than 0.01% up to ∼5% (the amount of phosphorylated form in the total amount of HK added), assuming that each HK carries a single site of phosphorylation (Fig. 2). The self-phosphorylation level was the highest (4%) for CheA, herein classified as group L1 (level 1). Group L2 with the high activity (higher than 0.03%) includes 14 members (YfhK, TorS, BaeS, RstB, PhoR, BasS, YedV, BarA, CreC, PhoQ, UhpB, CusS, KdpD, and DcuS in decreasing order) (Fig. 2). Six L3 group members (NtrB, HydH, CpxA, ArcB, NarX, and EnvZ in decreasing order) exhibited the phosphorylation level of lower than 0.02% and higher than 0.005%. The phosphorylation level was lower than 0.005% for L4 group HK members (NarQ, AtoS, EvgS, and YehU).Fig. 1Self-phosphorylation in vitro of HKs with ATP. One micromolar each of purified HK was incubated in the kinase buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at a final concentration of 2.5 μm at 37 °C for the indicated times (30 s to 30 min). The self-phosphorylation reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× sample buffer. The reaction mixture was directly subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed, dried, and exposed onto an image plate, and the plate was analyzed with BAS1000 (Fuji Film Co., Japan). The purified HKs used were ArcB (A), AtoS (B), BaeS (C), BarA (D), BasS (E), CheA (F), CpxA (G), CreC (H), CusS (I), DcuS (J), EnvZ (K), EvgS (L), HydH (M), KdpD (N), NarQ (O), NarX (P), NtrB (Q), PhoQ (R), PhoR (S), RstB (T), TorS (U), UhpB (V), YedV (W), YehU (X), and YfhK (Y).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2Relationship between the rate and the level of self-phosphorylation of HK. Self-phosphorylation of the purified HKs was carried out under the standard reaction conditions as described in Fig. 1. The intensity of HK-bound 32P radioactivity was measuring with BAS1000 (Fuji Film Co., Japan), and the net amount of phosphorylated HKs was calculated by using the calibration curve, which provides a linear relation between the phosphorylated HK molecule and the HK-bound 32P radioactivity. The rate of the self-phosphorylation is shown as the time (t50%) required to give half (50%) of the maximum level of phosphorylation. The uppercase letters in each spot corresponds to that in Fig. 1. HKs were classified into four groups (R1 to R4) based on the rate of self-phosphorylation and also into four groups (L1 to L4) on the level of phosphorylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The rate of the self-phosphorylation activity, shown as the time (t50%) required for half of the maximum level, can be classified into four groups (Fig. 2). The R1 group showing the fastest rate of phosphorylation (t50%, less than 2 min) includes, in decreasing order, ArcB, BasS, NtrB, HydH, PhoR, BarA, PhoQ, and TorS (Fig. 2). The R2 group showing the phosphorylation rate (t50%) of 3–5 min includes, in decreasing order, YfhK, NarQ, DcuS, RstB, YedV, and CusS. The R3 group showing the rate of 5–10 min includes, in decreasing order, KdpD, EvgS, UhpB, BaeS, NarX, CheA, CpxA, EnvZ, and CreC. Two R4 group members, AtoS and YehU, showed the lowest rate (t50%) of more than 10 min. Both the rate and the level of phosphorylation were very low for AtoC and YehU, supposedly because the contents of active HK molecules were low for these preparations.Among the 25 HK species analyzed, a total of 17 members showed good correlation between the rate (R) and the level (L) of self-phosphorylation (shaded area in Fig. 2). The activity difference in this group might reflect a difference in the population of active HK molecules in the purified HK preparations. One of the novel findings in this study was the detection of dephosphorylation activity for HK. Even in the presence of [32P]ATP, for instance, the level of phosphorylated NtrB decreased after saturation (see Fig. 1). Five HK members, ArcB (spot A), NtrB (spot Q), HydH (spot M), NarQ (spot O), and EvgS (spot L), showed high rates of phosphorylation but low saturation levels (R > L, above the shaded area in Fig. 2). As in the case of NtrB, the HKs of this group may have high activities of dephosphorylation under the reaction conditions employed. On the other hand, three HK members, CheA (spot F), BaeS (spot C), and CreC (spot H) (R < L, below the shaded area in Fig. 2), showed high levels of self-phosphorylation even though the rates of phosphorylation were low.Trans-phosphorylation of RRs by HKs—From both the previously characterized data of E. coli TCS systems and the paired location of HK and RR genes on the E. coli genome, a total of 26 TCS pairs including both CheA-CheB and CheA-CheY have been predicted (3Mizuno T. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The genes for five HKs (arcB, barA, narQ, rcsC, and yojN) and six RRS (arcA, fimZ, narP, rcsB, rssB, and uvrY) are not linked to the genes for respective RR partners on the genome. Based on genetic and/or biochemical data, these orphan HKs and RRs have been considered to form the following cognate HK-RR pairs: ArcB-ArcA, BarA-UvrY, and NarQ-NarP (6Pernestig A. Melefors O. Georgellis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 225-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Stewart V. Rabin R.S. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 223-231Google Scholar). The RcsC-YojN and YojN-RcsB systems form a sequential pathway, RcsC-YojN-RcsB, of the His-Asp phospho-relay (19Takeda S. Fujisawa Y. Matsubara M. Aiba H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Up to now, however, no HK partners have been identified for two RRs, FimZ and RssB.By using a total of 25 functional HKs with self-phosphorylation activity (see Figs. 1 and 2), we performed the trans-phosphorylation assay for all possible combinations. A fixed amount of each HK was first incubated with [γ-32P]ATP for self-phosphorylation until saturation (see Fig. 1), and then mixed with an equal molar amount of the respective cognate RR and an excess amount of unlabeled ATP (100-fold molar excess over the radiolabeled ATP). First we examined the HK-RR cognate pairs. Among a total of 26 cognate HK-RR pairs, including both CheA-CheB and CheA-CheY pairs, a significant level of transphosphorylation was observed at least for 24 pairs (Fig. 3). EvgS failed to phosphorylate EvgA under the reaction conditions employed, whereas trans-phosphorylation level for AtoS-AtoC was hard to detect because these two components could not be separated onto SDS-PAGE.The level of RR phosphorylation was estimated by measuring both the increase in RR-associated 32P radioactivity and the decrease in HK-associated radioactivity. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. Both the rate and the level of RR phosphorylation were different among the 24 HK-RR pairs. The maximum level of phosphorylated RR was detected less than 5 min after the addition of phosphorylated HK. The decrease of HK-associated 32P radioactivity was fast for 16 HK-RR pairs (group A), including pArcB, pBaeS, pCheA, pCpxA, pCreC, pCusS, pDcuS, pKdpD, pNarX, pNarQ, pNtrB, pTorS, pUhpB, pYehU, and pYfhK (where p represents the phosphorylated form). Concomitantly with the dissociation of 32P radioactivity from HKs, the respective cognate RRs were phosphorylated. The maximum level of trans-phosphorylation in these cases was observed within <1 min. The lifetime of RR-bound 32P appears different among RR species. The RR-bound 32P was stably retained for the A1 group RRs such as pArcA, pCpxR, pCusR, pKdpE, and pNarL but was rapidly released for the A2 group RRs, including pBaeR, pCheB, pCheY, pCreB, pDcuR, pNarP, pNtrC, pTorR, pUhpA, pYehT, and pYfhA. Because the rate of release of RR-bound 32P was different between the RR species, we concluded that the dephosphorylation rate is an intrinsic property of RR as in the case of HK. Thus, the sum of HK- and RR-bound 32P showed a time-dependent decrease in most cases, because the dephosphorylation takes place for both phosphorylated HKs and RRs. The rate of trans-phosphorylation was slow for another set of HKs (group B). The cognate RRs, which were phosphorylated by the group B HKs, remained phosphorylated for long periods. After prolonged incubation, the level of phosphorylated RRs increased up to completion for pBasR, pHydG, pOmpR, pPhoB, and pUvrY (group B1). On the other hand, the trans-phosphorylation stopped in the middle of the reaction for pPhoP, pRstA, and pYedW (group B2), and the phosphorylated form of group B2 HKs apparently stayed unchanged at the time 0 level.Fig. 4Time course of trans-phosphorylation of RRs by cognate HKs. Trans-phosphorylation of RRs by phosphorylated cognate HKs was carried out for various times as in Fig. 3. The amounts of phosphorylated HKs and RRs at each time point were measured, and the levels relative to the maximum level for each HK or RR are shown. On the basis of kinetic patterns, the reaction profiles are classified into A (subgroup A1 and A2) and B (subgroup B1 and B2) groups (for details see text). Panels a–w are the same pairs of HK and RR as panels a–x in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)At the time of maximum phosphorylation for each HK-RR pair, the level of phosphorylated RR was also different. High level phosphorylation (higher than 30% of input RR) was observed for CheY and YfhA. The phosphorylation level was from 1% to 10% for TorR, PhoB, CusR, BasR, RstA, UvrY, ArcA, BaeR, NtrC, KdpE, UhpA, and PhoP (in decreasing order). The level of phosphorylated RRs was less than 1% for CreB, HydG, YedW, NarL, CheB, OmpR, DcuR, CpxR, YehT, and NarP (in decreasing order).Cross-talks in Trans-phosphorylation between Non-cognate HK-RR Pairs—Phosphorylation in vivo of RR by non-cognate HK was suggested by genetic and microarray analysis of some HK mutants (4Oshima T.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 203-221Google Scholar). Here we carried out more systematic and direct search for the cross-talk of trans-phosphorylation of RRs by non-cognate HKs. By using 21 species of the functional HK except for TorS and YehU and 34 species of RR, we examined possible cross-talks in trans-phosphorylation for 692 combinations (21 × 34 - 22 (cognate pairs)). HKs were first self-phosphorylated by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min and then mixed with equimolar amounts of each non-cognate RR and excess unlabeled ATP. After 30 s of incubation, the mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis.Among a total of 692 non-cognate HK-RR pairs, trans-phosphorylation between non-cognate pairs was identified for a total of 22 combinations, as indicated by the red bars in Fig. 5. Seven species of HK (pBarA, pBaeS, pDcuS, pEnvZ, pRstB, pUhpB, and pYedV) phosphorylated non-cognate RR(s). Among these HKs, pUhpB phosphorylated 9 non-cognate RRs and 1 orphan RR (RssB), pBarA phosphorylated 4 non-cognate RRs, and pBaeS phosphorylated 2 non-cognate RRs, whereas pDcuS, pEnvZ, pRstB, and pYedV phosphorylated each non-cognate RR. The external signals sensed by these HKs must regulate, under certain conditions, the genes, which are under the control of another HK-RR system.Fig. 5Cross-talk in trans-phosphorylation between non-cognate HK-RR pairs. A total of 27 HKs and HK candidates were expressed and purified, except for 3 species (QseC, RcsC and YpdA, shown in green) that were not expressed under the conditions tested. Except for CitA and YojN (shown in blue), self-phosphorylation was detected for a total of 25 HK species (shown in red). Trans-phosphorylation in vitro was then carried out for a total of 850 combinations (25 HKs × 34 RRs). Between the cognate pairs, trans-phosphorylation was detected for 24 pairs (shown by black line) except for two pairs, AtoS-StoC and EvgS-EvgA (shown by black dotted line). Trans-phosphorylations between non-cognate pairs were detected for a total of 19 combinations (shown by red line). Three HKs (ArcB, CheA, and UhpB) phosphorylated RssB, whereas two HKs (BarA and UhpB) phosphorylated YgeK (shown by red dotted line). If each of these two orphan RRs form the cognate TCS pairs with one of these HKs, the rest of the trans-phosphorylation pairs might be attributable to cross-talks, and the total number of cross-talks increases to 22 combinations. Interference of trans-phosphorylation by non-cognate RR was detected for a total of 23 combinations (shown by blue line). Phosphorylation was not detected or not examined for some RRs (shown by black line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W2094586902,"The proglucagon gene (glu) encodes glucagon, expressed in pancreatic islets, and the insulinotropic hormone GLP-1, expressed in the intestines. These two hormones exert critical and opposite effects on blood glucose homeostasis. An intriguing question that remains to be answered is whether and how glu gene expression is regulated in a cell type-specific manner. We reported previously that the glu gene promoter in gut endocrine cell lines was stimulated by β-catenin, the major effector of the Wnt signaling pathway, whereas glu mRNA expression and GLP-1 synthesis were activated via inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, the major negative modulator of the Wnt pathway (Ni, Z., Anini, Y., Fang, X., Mills, G. B., Brubaker, P. L., & Jin, T. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 1380–1387). We now show that β-catenin and the glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitor lithium do not activate glu mRNA or glu promoter expression in pancreatic cell lines. In the intestinal GLUTag cell line, but not in the pancreatic InR1-G9 cell line, the glu promoter G2 enhancer-element was activated by lithium treatment via a TCF-binding motif. TCF-4 is abundantly expressed in the gut but not in pancreatic islets. Furthermore, both TCF-4 and β-catenin bind to the glu gene promoter, as detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Finally, stable introduction of dominant-negative TCF-4 into the GLUTag cell line repressed basal glu mRNA expression and abolished the effect of lithium on glu mRNA expression and GLP-1 synthesis. We have therefore identified a unique mechanism that regulates glu expression in gut endocrine cells only. Tissue-specific expression of TCF factors thus may play a role in the diversity of the Wnt pathway.

A major effector of this pathway is the bipartite transcription factor cat/TCF, 1The abbreviations used are: TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; β-cat, β-catenin; glu, proglucagon gene; GLP, glucagon-like peptide; RT, reverse transcription; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; DN, dominant-negative; LUC, luciferase. formed by the heterodimerization of β-catenin (β-cat) with one of the four TCF/LEF factors (TCF1, LEF-1, TCF-3, and TCF-4) (6He T.C.

Activation of this pathway occurs via various mechanisms, including inactivation of the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3β, by Wnt signals (6He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4102) Google Scholar), lithium (8Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr.

Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar), leading to the accumulation of free β-cat. Free β-cat accumulation may also occur as the consequence of mutations in several molecules in the Wnt signaling network including β-cat itself. More than 60 potential target genes have now been identified for cat/TCF, and the biological role of the Wnt pathway extends far beyond the scope of oncology and embryology. The proglucagon gene (glu) is expressed in pancreatic islet α cells, intestinal endocrine L cells, and selected neural cells in the brain (10Kieffer T.J. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 876-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the identical glu mRNA and prohormone are generated in these three tissues, post-translational processing leads to the cell/tissue-specific biosynthesis of three major peptide hormones, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and GLP-2. These three peptide hormones exert diametrically opposed or overlapping biological functions (11Steiner D.F. Rouille Y. Gong Q. Martin S. Carroll R. Chan S.J.

It is important in the maintenance of normoglycemia, particularly during fasting. In contrast, GLP-1, produced in the gut and brain, lowers blood sugar levels through stimulation of insulin secretion and biosynthesis, inhibition of glucagon release and gastric emptying, enhancement of peripheral insulin sensitivity, and importantly, induction of satiety (10Kieffer T.J.

Although the major function of GLP-2 is considered a growth factor for the small intestinal epithelium (17Drucker D.J. Erlich P. Asa S.L. Brubaker P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7911-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), recent studies indicate that it may also possess overlapping function with GLP-1 in the regulation of food intake (18Wojdemann M. Wettergren A. Hartmann B. Holst J.J. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1998; 33: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Exploring the molecular mechanisms that underlie cell type-specific expression of the glu gene may therefore lead to the development of novel approaches for the treatment and prevention of diabetes and obesity. We present in this study the identification of a molecular mechanism that specifically regulates glu gene expression in the gut endocrine L cells and suggest that the glu gene in gut endocrine L cells, but not in the pancreatic islet α cells, is a downstream target gene of cat/TCF. Plasmids—All proglucagon (GLU)/Luciferase (LUC) reporter gene plasmids have been described previously (19Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol.

G2-TK-LUC constructs were generated by inserting one copy of the corresponding element into the parental TK-LUC fusion gene (20Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Culture, Cell Transfection, and LUC Reporter Gene Analysis— Intestinal proglucagon producing GLUTag and STC-1 cell lines and pancreatic proglucagon producing InR1-G9 and α-TC-1 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with appropriate serum (Invitrogen) (19Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1306-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methods for examining the effects of lithium on GLU-LUC reporter gene expression, glu mRNA expression, and GLP-1 synthesis have been described previously (25Ni Z. Anini Y. Fang X. Mills G.B. Brubaker P.L. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1380-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA pPGS-dnTCF-4 or the empty vector were transfected into GLUTag cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and stable transfectants were selected with G-418 (final concentration, 1 mg/ml). Relative LUC activities were calculated as -fold induction relative to a corresponding control (mean ± S.D., n ≥ 3. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Antibodies, Western Blotting, and Immuno-Histochemical Staining—A rabbit polyclonal anti-TCF-4 (H-125) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A mouse monoclonal anti-TCF-4 antibody (clone 6H5–3) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-mouse IgG tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate conjugate and anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate were purchased from Sigma, whereas the rabbit polyclonal anti-GLP-1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Daniel J. Drucker (University of Toronto). The method used for Western blotting analyses has been described previously (25Ni Z. Anini Y. Fang X. Mills G.B. Brubaker P.L. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1380-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immunostaining and immunofluorescence staining were conducted using routine methods and viewed with a light microscope, a Zeiss fluorescence microscope, or an LSM510 confocal microscope. Northern Blotting Analysis and RT-PCR—Total RNA from each of the cultivated cell lines was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Methods for Northern blotting analysis have been described previously (20Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Ni Z. Anini Y. Fang X. Mills G.B. Brubaker P.L. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1380-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To examine TCF-4 mRNA expression, RT-PCR was performed using standard methods with the following primers: forward, 5′-CCAATCACGACAGGAGGATT-3′; reverse, 5′-TGATGCTTTGAGCTGTGGAG-3′. These primers amplify a 220-bp DNA sequence from either human or rodent TCF-4 cDNA. RT-PCR products were then inserted into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), and their identities were verified by DNA sequencing. Radioimmunoassay for GLP-1—As described previously (25Ni Z. Anini Y.

Endocrinol. 2002; 143: 2420-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), GLP-1 peptide was extracted from cells by extraction with 1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1 n HCl, 5% HCOOH, and 1% NaCl, followed by passage twice through a cartridge of C18 silica (C18 SepPak; Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Radioimmunoassay for GLP-1 was carried out using an antiserum directed toward the C-terminal end of GLP-1 (Affinity Research Products Ltd., Mamhead, UK). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Approximately 2 × 107 untreated wild-type GLUTag cells were used for each ChIP assay, using a method described previously (28Yi F. Jaffe R. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2823-2932Google Scholar) and formaldehyde to cross-link chromatin and nuclear proteins. After sonication, the designated antibody was added (final dilution of 1:500) to precipitate the shared chromatin. One-tenth of the final precipitated DNA (2 μl) was used in each PCR reaction. An anti-LEF-1 antibody (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), two anti-TCF-4 antibodies, an anti-β-catenin antibody (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and an anti-c-Myc antibody (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in the ChIP assay. The experimental primers (forward, 5′-CAAGGGATAAGACCCTCAAATG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCTTGCAGATATTACGCTGA-3′) amplify a 297-bp DNA fragment that contains the G2 enhancer element of the mouse glu gene promoter, based on the mouse proglucagon gene sequence (GenBank accession number: NT_039207) (29Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 8: 4877-4888Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The control primers (forward, 5′-TGCTTATAATGCTGGTGCAAG-3′; reverse, 5′-ATTCGTATCCCAGATCAG-3′) amplify a 205-bp DNA fragment that is part of the Exon 1 sequence of the mouse glu gene and that contains no TCF binding site. Confirmation that the fragments generated in PCR corresponded to the regions of interest was obtained by DNA sequencing and by Southern blotting with the corresponding DNA probe. Data Analysis—All data (relative LUC activity and relative GLP-1 synthesis) are expressed as mean ± S.D., n ≥ 3. Statistic differences between samples were assessed using Student's t test. Significance was assumed at p < 0.05. Lithium Treatment Does Not Activate glu mRNA Expression in Pancreatic Islet Cell Lines—We have demonstrated previously that the GSK-3β inhibitor lithium stimulates glu mRNA expression in the gut GLUTag and STC-1 endocrine cell lines, as well as in primary fetal rat intestinal cell cultures (25Ni Z. Anini Y. Fang X. Mills G.B. Brubaker P.L. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1380-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The activation in GLUTag and STC-1 cell lines was repeated in this study (Fig. 1a). However, when the same approach was applied to two pancreatic α cell lines, InR1-G9 and α-TC-1, we found that lithium generated no activation of glu mRNA expression. Instead, lithium repressed glu mRNA expression for these two cell lines. Fig. 1a shows a representative Northern blot from three independent experiments; Fig. 1b shows the result of the densitometry analysis. These data represent the first observation that glu mRNA expression can be differentially regulated in proglucagon-producing cell lines of the gut compared with those of pancreas. A TCF Binding Motif within the G2 Enhancer Element Mediates the Cell Type-specific Activation—Expression of the pTOPFLASH fusion gene has been used as an indicator for cat/TCF activity in colon cancer cells, as well as in other cancer cell lines (23Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In this fusion gene plasmid, the LUC reporter gene expression is under the control of the simian virus-40 minimal promoter, linked to a consensus TCF binding motif (23Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We found that the pTOPFLASH fusion gene was significantly activated by lithium treatment when transfected into the intestinal GLUTag cell line (Fig. 2, left) (25Ni Z. Anini Y. Fang X. Mills G.B. Brubaker P.L. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1380-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, when transfected into the pancreatic InR1-G9 cell line, lithium treatment generated no significant activation of its expression (Fig. 2, right). This observation indicates that cat/TCF activity may not exist in this pancreatic islet cell line. As shown in Fig. 3a, there are five potential TCF binding sites (designated TCF-A, -B, -C, -D, and -E), located within the first 2.3 kb of the rat glu gene promoter. Because we found that lithium activated a -302-bp glu promoter construct in the GLUTag cell line, we speculated that TCF-E, a part of the G2 enhancer element (-200 to -165 bp) (28Yi F. Jaffe R. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2823-2932Google Scholar), might be the key cis-factor for this activation. This TCF binding site is conserved between the proglucagon genes of humans, mice, and rats. Fig. 3a also shows the construction of three new GLU-LUC fusion genes: G2L-TK-LUC, G2S-TK-LUC, and G2M-TK-LUC. G2L (long) represents the full-length wild-type G2 enhancer element (29Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 8: 4877-4888Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas G2S (short) is 8 bp shorter than G2L, although the TCF binding site remains unchanged. G2M (mutant) is identical with G2S, except for the presence of a disabling mutation in the TCF binding site. When the three GLU-LUC fusion genes were transfected into the gut GLUTag cell line, lithium treatment was found to significantly activate the expression of both G2L-TK-LUC and G2S-TK-LUC but not the expression of G2M-TK-LUC (Fig. 3b). In contrast, lithium treatment generated no detectable effect on G2S-TK-LUC activity when transfected into the pancreatic InR1-G9 cell line. Furthermore, the expression of both G2L-TK-LUC and G2M-TK-LUC was repressed by lithium treatment when transfected into the InR1-G9 cell line (Fig. 3b). The reporter gene G2S-TK-LUC was then used to examine the effect of co-transfection with S33Y-β-cat, a constitutively active mutant that cannot be destroyed by GSK-3β (22Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ni Z. Anini Y. Fang X. Mills G.B. Brubaker P.L. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1380-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this study, the parental TK-LUC construct was included to examine whether G2S itself could serve as an enhancer element for the TK promoter. As shown in Fig. 3c, when transfected into the GLUTag cell line, the LUC reporter gene activity of G2S-TK-LUC was more than 2-fold higher than that of the parental TK-LUC. When transfected into the InR1-G9 cell line, however, the LUC reporter gene activity of G2S-TK-LUC was similar to that of the parental TK-LUC fusion gene. These observations suggest that G2S serves as an enhancer element for gut proglucagon-producing cells, but not for the pancreatic proglucagon-producing cells. Co-transfection with the constitutively active S33Y β-cat also generated a significant activation of G2S-TK-LUC in the GLUTag cell line but not in the InR1-G9 cell line (Fig. 3c). If the major effect of lithium treatment on glu promoter expression occurs via the inhibition of GSK-3β, one would expect that overexpression of GSK-3β might attenuate the effect of lithium. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that co-transfection of GSK-3β with G2S-TK-LUC or pTOP-FLASH (in a 5:1 ratio) completely abolished the activation mediated by lithium treatment (Fig. 3d). Taken together, our observations suggest that TCF-E within the G2 enhancer element mediates the activation of glu gene expression by lithium treatment and by S33Y β-cat co-transfection, specifically in the gut proglucagon-producing cells. TCF-4 Binds to glu Promoter and Is Expressed in Gut but Not in Pancreatic Endocrine Cells—Among the four known TCF factors that bind β-cat, TCF-4 is the major mediator of Wnt signals in colon cancer cells (24Korinek V.

Furthermore, in the absence of free β-cat, TCF factors may serve as negative modulators of gene expression because they lack the activation domains but are still able to occupy TCF binding sites on cat/TCF target promoters. Indeed, we found that wild-type TCF-4 cDNA repressed the -302 bp GLU-LUC fusion gene when co-transfected into the GLUTag cell line (data not shown). ChIP assay was then used to examine whether TCF-4 and β-cat in GLUTag cell line bind to the glu gene promoter. Fig. 4a is a schematic presentation of the two pairs of PCR primers used in the ChIP assay, whereas Fig. 4b shows a representative ChIP assay result. The experimental primers amplify the DNA sequence from -43 bp to -340 bp of the mouse glu gene, a fragment that contains the G2 enhancer element. The control primers amplify a 205-bp DNA fragment within exon I of the mouse glu gene. This region contains no TCF binding site. Two different anti-TCF-4 antibodies and an anti-β-cat antibody were able to precipitate chromatin DNA that contains the G2 element, whereas the anti-c-Myc antibody could not. The same anti-c-Myc antibody has been previously used in examining the in vivo binding of c-Myc to CCL6 gene promoter (28Yi F. Jaffe R. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2823-2932Google Scholar). It is interesting that the anti-LEF-1 antibody was also able to precipitate chromatin containing the G2 enhancer element. We then examined the expression of TCF-4 in proglucagon-producing cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5a, TCF-4 mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR in the GLUTag cell line (lane 1) as well as in the human SW480 colon cancer cell line (as positive control; lane 3) but was not detected in the pancreatic InR1-G9 cell line (lane 2). Fig. 5b further shows the detection of TCF-4 protein in two gut proglucagon-producing cell lines, GLUTag (lane 1) and STC-1 (lane 2), and in the human colon cancer cell line SW480 (lane 5), by Western blotting. TCF-4 protein expression in the two pancreatic α cell lines was barely detectable (lanes 3 and 4). Finally, immunostaining was performed in both proglucagon-producing cell lines as well as in murine paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Immunofluorescence staining showed that TCF-4 is abundantly expressed in the GLUTag and STC-1 cell lines but was barely detectable in the InR1-G9 and α-TC-1 cell lines (Fig. 6a). Consistent with these findings, TCF-4 immunoreactivity was also identified in the nucleus of most intestinal epithelial cells but was absent in pancreatic islets (Fig. 6b). Co-expression of TCF-4 and GLP-1 was then demonstrated in the GLUTag cell line by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 6c, right). The pancreatic InR1-G9 cells also expressed small amount of immunoreactive GLP-1, because of abnormal post-translational processing of the proglucagon in this cell line, but did not express TCF-4 (Fig. 6c, left).Fig. 6Detection of TCF-4 expression in cultivated cell lines and in paraffin-embedded pancreatic and intestine tissue samples.a, detection of TCF-4 immunoactivity in cultivated cell lines using a rabbit polyclonal anti-TCF-4 (diluted 1:100) with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (green).

GLUTag and InR1-G9 cells were incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-TCF-4 antibody (6H5–3) and the rabbit polyclonal anti-GLP-1 antibody. The primary antibodies were then detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (green) and TRICT-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (red). Cell nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). Cells were viewed with a LSM510 confocal microscope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dominant-Negative TCF-4 Represses Basal glu mRNA Expression and Disrupts the Activation Mediated by Lithium in GLUTag Cells—To further elucidate the role of TCF-4 in regulating gut glu mRNA expression and GLP-1 synthesis, we stably transfected GLUTag cells with a dominant-negative (DN) TCF-4 construct that lacks the N-terminal β-cat binding site (22Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7a). This approach has been successfully used by Kolligs et al. (22Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to study S33Y β-cat-mediated neoplastic transformation. Northern blotting analysis showed that basal glu mRNA expression was substantially reduced in GLUTag-TCF-4(DN) cells compared with either wild-type GLUTag cells or GLUTag cells stably transfected with the empty retroviral vector (GLUTag-TCF-4(V); Fig. 7b). Furthermore, glu mRNA expression in the GLUTag-TCF-4(DN) cells showed no response to lithium treatment. We then compared the effect of lithium treatment on expression of the LUC reporter gene constructs pTOPFLASH and G2S-TK-LUC in GLUTag-TCF-4(DN) and GLUTag-TCF-4(V) cells. When pTOPFLASH was examined, GLUTag-TCF-4(DN) cells showed no response to lithium treatment, whereas GLUTag-TCF-4(V) cells demonstrated ∼10-fold activation by lithium (Fig. 7c, left). Likewise, when G2S-TK-LUC was examined, the activation by lithium treatment in GLUTag-TCF-4(DN) cells was less than 1.5-fold, compared with greater than 3-fold activation in GLUTag-TCF-4(V) cells (Fig. 7d, right). The effect of lithium treatment on GLP-1 synthesis in GLUTag-TCF-4(DN) was then investigated. Consistent with our previous results (25Ni Z. Anini Y. Fang X. Mills G.B. Brubaker P.L. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1380-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), lithium treatment increased GLP-1 levels at both 12 and 24 h in the wild-type GLUTag cells, although the activation was much weaker at 24 h (Fig. 8). Increases in GLP-1 synthesis in response to lithium treatment were also observed in GLUTag-TCF-4(V) cells. However, GLUTag-TCF-4(DN) cells completely lost the response to lithium (Fig. 8). These observations strongly indicate the involvement of TCF-4 in activation of both glu mRNA expression and GLP-1 synthesis in gut endocrine cells by inhibiting GSK-3β with lithium. Finally, we asked whether the lack of the response in pancreatic cell lines to GSK-3β inactivation is caused simply by the lack of TCF-4 expression. TCF-4 cDNA was co-transfected with G2S-TK-LUC into the InR1-G9 cell line. No appreciable activation of this reporter gene by lithium treatment was observed, indicating the lack of additional components or the involvement of unrevealed mechanisms in pancreatic cells (data not shown"

Aggregation takes place in the cytoplasm and could therefore be cytotoxic for neurons. To find inhibitors of PHF aggregation we screened a library of 200,000 compounds. The hits found in the PHF inhibition assay were also tested for their ability to dissolve preformed PHFs. The results were obtained using a thioflavin S fluorescence assay for the detection and quantification of tau aggregation in solution, a tryptophan fluorescence assay using tryptophan-containing mutants of tau, and confirmed by a pelleting assay and electron microscopy of the products. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach with several compounds from the family of anthraquinones, including emodin, daunorubicin, adriamycin, and others. They were able to inhibit PHF formation with IC50 values of 1–5 μm and to disassemble preformed PHFs at DC50 values of 2–4 μm. The compounds had a similar activity for PHFs made from different tau isoforms and constructs. The compounds did not interfere with the stabilization of microtubules by tau. Tau-inducible neuroblastoma cells showed the formation of tau aggregates and concomitant cytotoxicity, which could be prevented by inhibitors. Thus, small molecule inhibitors could provide a basis for the development of tools for the treatment of tau pathology in AD and other tauopathies.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; PHF, paired helical filaments; ThS, thioflavin S; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. two main proteins form abnormal polymers (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). The extracellular amyloid plaques consist largely of polymerized Aβ-peptide, whereas the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are made from the microtubule-associated protein tau (2Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). These insoluble aggregates or their oligomeric precursors are involved in neuronal degeneration. The distribution of the neurofibrillary changes can be used for the diagnosis and staging of AD (3Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11766) Google Scholar); it is based on the appearance of tau in an aggregated state that in addition is chemically modified (phosphorylation, truncation, and glycation). Whether these modifications are the cause or merely by-products of neuronal degeneration has been a matter of debate. For example, different kinase pathways have been considered responsible for the early stages of neurodegeneration (4Johnson G.V. Bailey C.D. J. Alzheimer's Dis. 2002; 4: 375-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar). On the other hand, unphosphorylated tau can be induced to aggregate, and the phosphorylation of tau retards aggregation in vitro (6Schneider A. von Biernat J. Bergen M. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3549-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Examples from other protein aggregation diseases suggest that an increase in concentration drives the protein into aggregation and causes toxic effects (7Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3855-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and conversely the reduction of aggregates alleviates the diseases (8Schenk D. Barbour R. Dunn W. Gordon G. Grajeda H. Guido T. Hu K. Huang J. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Kholodenko D. Lee M. Liao Z. Lieberburg I. Motter R. Mutter L. Soriano F. Shopp G. Vasquez N. Vandevert C. Walker S. Wogulis M. Yednock T. Games D. Seubert P. Nature. 1999; 400: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2965) Google Scholar, 9Sanchez I. Mahlke C. Yuan J. Nature. 2003; 421: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In the case of Aβ aggregation in AD, cytotoxicity may be caused by the extracellular plaques or by prefibrillary oligomers within cells (10Glabe C. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of inherited tau pathologies (FTDP-17) various cell models, transgenic mice, and other organisms have been generated to study tau aggregation (11Hutton M. Lewis J. Dickson D. Yen S.H. McGowan E. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Gotz J. Streffer J.R. David D. Schild A. Hoerndli F. Pennanen L. Kurosinski P. Chen F. Mol. Psychiatry. 2004; 9: 664-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), but they do not yet reflect the full spectrum of the human pathology, and there is a debate on which form of tau is responsible for its toxicity. Evidence for cytotoxicity of intracellular aggregates comes from other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Huntington's disease (13Petersen A. Brundin P. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 315-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 991: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In Parkinson's disease the cytotoxicity of α-synuclein has been traced back to prefibrillary oligomers binding to membranes (15Caughey B. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). In Huntington's disease aggregated protein can be found in the nucleus, possibly affecting gene transcription. In cellular and mouse models the disaggregation of polymers improved viability (9Sanchez I. Mahlke C. Yuan J. Nature. 2003; 421: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Heiser V. Scherzinger E. Boeddrich A. Nordhoff E. Lurz R. Schugardt N. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6739-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the case of tau we face the paradoxon that the protein is highly soluble yet can aggregate into insoluble polymers. Soluble tau is a natively unfolded protein with mostly random coil conformation (17Schweers O. Schonbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18von Friedhoff P. Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Davies P. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15712-15717Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 19von Bergen M. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), but certain motifs can undergo a conformational change toward β-structure, which promotes the formation of AD-like filaments. Because the aggregation of tau in AD correlates with the clinical progression of the disease, it seemed likely that inhibition or reversal of tau aggregation could protect the affected neurons. To test this idea we began a search for inhibitors of tau aggregation and screened a library of 200,000 compounds. 1266 compounds were positive; 77 were even capable of dissolving preformed aggregates at low micromolar concentrations, and a subclass is described here. The compounds do not impair the physiological function of tau of stabilizing microtubules. Finally, cell models that show tau aggregation and cytotoxicity after inducible expression of tau can be rescued by inhibitors of aggregation. Chemicals and Proteins—Heparin (average molecular weight of 3000), polyglutamate (average molecular weight of 600 or 1000), and thioflavin S were obtained from Sigma. Full-length tau isoforms htau23 and htau24 and constructs of the repeat domain of tau (see Fig. 1B) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by making use of the heat stability and fast protein liquid chromatography Mono S (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography as described (20Biernat J. Gustke N. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Emodin, daunorubicin, and adriamycin were obtained from Merck. PHF016 was obtained from ChemBridge, and PHF005 was obtained from Interchim. All of the experiments presented here were carried out with freshly dissolved compounds. PHF Formation in Vitro—Assembly of PHFs from tau protein (K19, 10 μm) was performed at 37 °C in the presence of polyanions (heparin, 2.5 μm) in 50 mm NH4Ac, pH 6.8. Assembly was followed either qualitatively by electron microscopy or quantitatively by fluorescence assay using thioflavin S. PHF formation from tau isoforms htau23 and htau24 was carried out in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, 10 μm protein, and 2.5 μm heparin. The samples were incubated at 50 °C for 10 days. In the case of hTau24 and K18, dithiothreitol was added at a final concentration of 1 mm each day to avoid intramolecular disulfide cross-linking (21Barghorn S. Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Ackmann M. von Biernat J. Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11714-11721Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Screening of Tau Aggregation Inhibitors by Thioflavin S Assay—PHF formation was monitored by a thioflavin S fluorescence assay (22Friedhoff P. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10223-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Using an automated pipetting system (Cybi-Well; CyBio, Jena, Germany) 50 mm NH4Ac, 10 μm protein (K19), 60 μm compound, and 2.5 μm heparin were mixed in 50 μl of volume in a 384-well plate (black microtiter 384 plate round well; ThermoLabsystems, Dreieich, Germany) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. As a control the protein was replaced with H2O to measure the fluorescence of the compounds. After incubation with the compounds, thioflavin S was added to a final concentration of 20 μm, and the signal was measured at excitation of 440 nm and emission of 521 nm in a spectrofluorimeter (Ascent; Labsystems, Frankfurt, Germany). To measure the inhibition of PHF assembly and disassembly of PHFs, we chose compound concentrations of 200, 60, and 10 μm down to 10 pm at a 10 μm concentration of tau. All of the measurements were carried out three times. Tryptophan Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The fluorescence experiments were performed on a Spex Fluoromax spectrophotometer (Polytec, Waldbronn, Germany) using 3 × 3-mm microcuvettes from Hellma (Mühlheim, Germany) with 20-μl sample volumes. Tryptophan emission was scanned from 300 to 450 nm at fixed excitation wavelength of 290 nm. For the inhibition assay, 60 μm compounds were incubated with constructs K19/Y310W, K18/Y310W, or K18ΔK280/Y310W (10 μm) and heparin (2.5 μm) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 3 days at 37 °C. Dithiothreitol was added at a final concentration of 1 mm in the case of K18/Y310W and K18ΔK280/Y310W. For the disassembly assay, 60 μm inhibitor compound were added to preformed PHFs (10 μm) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. PHFs were formed by incubation of tau construct K19/Y310W, K18/Y310W, or K18ΔK280/Y310W (10 μm) with 2.5 μm heparin in volume of 100 μl at 37 °C in PBS, pH 7.4. Dithiothreitol at final concentration 1 mm was added in the case of the two last constructs. Incubation time was 3 days. Aggregation was monitored by a blue shift of the emission maximum (∼354 nm for soluble tau, ∼340 nm for aggregates). Filter Trapping Assay—Aggregates of tau were trapped by filtration through a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (pore diameter, 0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell, Düren, Germany) adapted to a 96-well dot blot apparatus. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was wetted with methanol and rinsed with PBS buffer before insertion. The samples were pipetted into 100 μl of PBS and filtered. The membrane was washed three times with PBS before taking it out of the apparatus and blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS for 30 min in a rotational shaker at room temperature. The polyclonal antibody K9JA was used as primary antibody and incubated at a dilution of 1:20,000 at room temperature for 1 h. A secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) was diluted 1:2000 and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After three times washing with TBS-Tween, the signal was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The pictures were taken with the digital gel documentation system Fuji film BAS3000 (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) and quantified with the AIDA software package (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Electron Microscopy—Protein solutions diluted to 0.1–10 μm were placed on 600-mesh carbon-coated copper grids for 1 min and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 45 s. The specimens were examined in a Philips CM12 electron microscope at 100 kV (Eindhoven, Netherlands). Light Scattering Analysis of Tau-induced Microtubule Assembly— Microtubule assembly was monitored by light scattering at 350 nm in a Tecan spectrophotometer model Safire (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). Tau protein (10 μm) was mixed with tubulin dimer (30 μm) and GTP (1 mm) at 4 °C in polymerization buffer (100 mm Na-PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with a final volume of 40 μl. Tau and inhibitor compounds (60 μm) were added last. After rapid mixing, the samples were pipetted into a Greiner transparent flat bottom 384-well plate (4-mm path length) prewarmed at 37 °C. The reaction was started by incubating the cooled reaction components at 37 °C. The assembly of tubulin into microtubules was monitored by a change in turbidity. Three parameters were extracted from curves. The maximum turbidity at steady state, the rate of assembly, and the lag time between the temperature jump and the start of the turbidity rise. Inducible Expression of Tau in N2a Cells—The generation of the cell model is described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, tau construct K18ΔK280 was expressed in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2a in an inducible manner under the control of the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (23Gossen M. Bujard H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 153-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.1% nonessential amino acids. Expression of K18ΔK280 was induced by adding 1 μg of doxycyclin/1 ml of medium. The induction was continued over 7 days, and the medium was changed three times in 2-day intervals, complemented with doxycyclin or with doxycyclin plus tau aggregation inhibitors. Assays of Tau Aggregation in N2a Cells—The levels and solubility of the K18ΔK280 tau protein were determined by the method of Greenberg and Davies (24Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), which makes use of the insolubility of protein aggregates in cell homogenates after treatment with sarkosyl. The supernatant and sarcosyl-insoluble pellets were analyzed by Western blotting with the pan-tau antibody K9JA and analyzed by densitometry. Aggregation of tau in cells was tested by the fluorescence of thioflavin S. ThS signals were scored in three independent fields containing 40 cells each. Compounds Sharing a Core Structure of Hydroxyanthraquinone Inhibit PHF Assembly—We tested 200,000 compounds in a high throughput screen for their capability of interfering with the aggregation of tau protein. Several members of the class of hydroxyanthraquinone and related structures were found (Fig. 1A). They all share a tricyclic aromatic ring system with some modifications. Emodin and compound PHF016 belong to the class of hydroxyanthraquinones, whereas compound PHF005 represents a benzophenone derivative. Daunorubicin and adriamycin are enlarged with a further ring system to the naphthacendione structure and a sugar moiety. The initial screening for inhibition of PHF aggregation was performed with the three-repeat tau construct K19 (Fig. 1B). This was chosen because it aggregates reliably at low micromolar concentrations in the presence of the polyanionic cofactor heparin and resembles Alzheimer's PHFs in terms of fiber morphology and β-sheet content (19von Bergen M. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 25von Bergen M. Barghorn S. Li L. Marx A. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48165-48174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The results described here were obtained by measuring the extent of aggregation via the fluorescence of ThS (22Friedhoff P. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10223-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This is based on the binding of ThS to fibers containing β-structure, which causes a change in the fluorescence spectrum (29Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the screen we performed polymerization of K19 in the presence and absence of inhibitors. Hits were defined by a >90% decrease of the ThS signal compared with the control reaction without compounds. This level of inhibition was reached by 1266 compounds (0.6% of the cohort). These were further tested for their ability to dissolve preformed PHFs, a more stringent criterium. 77 compounds were able to reduce the PHF-specific signal ThS fluorescence by more than 80%. To confirm the data we also used the four-repeat constructs K18 and K18ΔK280 and the related full-length isoforms htau23 (three repeats, no inserts) and htau24 (four repeats, no inserts). The five compounds discussed here are able to inhibit the transition from soluble to aggregated K19 protein, but they differ in their efficiency. Using fixed protein concentrations of K19 at 10 μm, we tested the compounds in a concentration range from 10 pm to 200 μm (Fig. 2A) and determined IC50 values (Table I). Inhibitory effects begin to appear at ∼0.1 μm (ratio of protein to compound = 100) and reach nearly complete inhibition at 100 μm compound (ratio protein to compound = 0.1). The curves of Fig. 2A decay fairly steeply over a compound concentration range of 2–3 orders of magnitude. The values of half-maximal inhibition (IC50) are in the low micromolar range, which means that all compounds interfere with PHF aggregation of K19 already at substoichiometric concentrations. The four repeat construct K18 was tested under the same conditions (Fig. 2B), yielding IC50 values down to the submicromolar range. However, the decay of the curves of K18 is more gradual than those of K19, extending over 3–4 orders of magnitude (compare Fig. 2A). This suggests that the filaments made from the three-repeat construct K19 are more stable and more homogeneous than those made from the four-repeat K18, possibly because K18 contains two nucleating hexapeptide motifs.Table IIC50 values for PHF assembly inhibition and disassembly Higher values indicate higher resistance of PHFs against inhibitor compounds.Inhibition of tau aggregation (IC50)Disassembly of PHFs (DC50)CompoundK19K18K18ΔK280hTau23hTau24K19K18K18ΔK280hTau23hTau24With heparinWithout heparinWith heparinWithout heparinμmμmEmodin1.60.32.71.90.21.82.82.01.83.97.0>60Daunorubicin1.30.34.54.00.13.43.14.04.57.48.2>60Adriamycin2.40.14.12.40.22.72.94.34.83.913.2>60PHF0161.10.61.20.61.0>602.27.31.50.7>6039.2PHF0054.62.78.82.11.1>1003.820.88.83.1>6010.8 Open table in a new tab The study was then extended to the natural three- and four-repeat isoforms htau23 and htau24 (Fig. 1B). PHF formation of these proteins was assayed in the presence of 0.1, 1, 10, and 60 μm compound (Fig. 2, C and D). Again a clear dose-dependent inhibition was observed. In this case the filaments from the three-repeat isoform htau23 are somewhat less stable than those from the four-repeat htau24. The compounds can be subdivided into two groups. For htau23 the more effective compounds are adriamycin, daunorubicin, and emodin, which are capable of inhibiting PHF formation ∼50% at 0.1 μm and ∼90% at 60 μm. Compounds PHF016 and PHF005 are less inhibitory, and they show only a slight effect at low concentration and a moderate one (∼60%) at 60 μm. For htau24 the ranking is roughly the same, with PHF016 and PHF005 showing little inhibitory activity. All of the polymerization reactions carried out so far used heparin as a cofactor for inducing PHF assembly because otherwise the process would be impracticably slow (26Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 27Perez M. Valpuesta J.M. Montejo de Medina M. Garcini E. Avila J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). To rule out a potential influence of heparin on the efficiency of the compounds, we used the four-repeat construct K18ΔK280, which carries one of the mutations observed in frontotemporal dementia (28van Swieten J.C. Stevens M. Rosso S.M. Rizzu P. Joosse M. de Koning I. Kamphorst W. Ravid R. Niermeijer Spillantini M.G. Heutink P. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and is capable of aggregating into PHFs without a polyanionic cofactor (25von Bergen M. Barghorn S. Li L. Marx A. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48165-48174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, E and F). Overall the IC50 values of assembly inhibition are higher or equal for K18ΔK280 than for K18wt (suggesting that K18wt is more easily disrupted than the mutant), but the values are comparable with or without heparin, indicating that heparin does not greatly influence the interference between the compounds and PHFs. To exclude a possible distortion of the data by the ThS dye, we wanted to confirm the results by a tryptophan fluorescence assay (30von Li L. Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41390-41400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It allows the detection of the molecular environment of a tryptophan introduced instead of tyrosine 310 whose emission maximum is sensitive to the burial in a more hydrophobic surrounding upon PHF formation. We therefore created the mutants K19/Y310W, K18/Y310W, and K18ΔK280/Y310W (Fig. 1B) that contain a single tryptophan within the core of the PHF structure. In the soluble protein the emission maximum lies at ∼354 nm (dashed line), whereas it shifts to 340 nm upon PHF formation (dotted line) (Fig. 3A, first and second entries). The emission peak can be shifted back by incubation at high concentrations of guanidine HCl, which is due to the disassembly of the PHFs (Fig. 3A, fourth entry). In the Trp fluorescence assay the inhibition of PHF assembly becomes apparent if the emission maximum of Trp310 remains higher than that of the control without any compound, because Trp310 remains in a more solvent-accessible environment. The three repeat tau construct K19/Y310W (at 10 μm) is prevented from aggregation by ∼90% by all compounds at 60 μm (Fig. 3A; note that the fifth through the ninth entries retain their values of ∼354 nm, similar to control 1). By contrast the four repeat tau construct K18/Y310W is inhibited to this high extent only by PHF005 (Fig. 3B, ninth entry). Emodin, daunorubicin, and adriamycin can prevent PHF formation to ∼70% at 60 μm (Fig. 3B, fifth, sixth, and seventh entries), whereas PHF016 achieves only 25% inhibition (eighth entry). The trend becomes even more pronounced in the case of K18ΔK280/Y310W, where all compounds show a lower activity (Fig. 3C). The internal ranking stays roughly the same as with K18; PHF005 (ninth entry) is the best, PHF016 (eighth entry) the worst inhibitor. Emodin, daunorubicin, and adriamycin (fifth, sixth, and seventh entries) showed a level of ∼30–50% inhibition. The apparent degrees of inhibition differ somewhat between the ThS fluorescence and the intrinsic Trp fluorescence assays. One likely explanation is the different origin of the signal. In the ThS assay the dye has to bind to the filaments, which requires a minimal length of the fibers. The tryptophan fluorescence assay depends on the local surrounding of the residue and is therefore less dependent on the length of the filaments. PHFs Can Be Dissolved by Inhibitor Compounds—Inhibiting the aggregation is one important aspect of a potential therapeutic compound, but even more important may be the ability to dissolve preformed filaments. We used the ThS assay to analyze this aspect with PHFs made from the repeat domain constructs K19 and K18 as well as from isoforms htau23 and htau24, containing three or four repeats. The disassembly of K19 filaments (Fig. 2G) follows similar concentration dependence as the inhibition experiment, with similar or slightly higher DC50 values than the corresponding IC50 concentrations (low micromolar range; Table I). K18 filaments show equal or slightly higher DC50 values, i.e. the four-repeat constructs are more resistant to the compounds (Fig. 2H). Here, too, the concentration dependence for K19 is steeper than for K18 (Fig. 2, compare G and H), similar to that of assembly inhibition (Fig. 2, A and B), arguing for more heterogeneity in the K18 filaments. PHFs from the full-length three-repeat isoform htau23 can also be disassembled, albeit with lower efficiency (Fig. 2I). Emodin, daunorubicin, and adriamycin (DC50 range, 7.0–13 μm) are more potent than PHF016 and PHF005 (DC50 > 60 μm), consistent with the ranking in the assembly inhibition assay (Fig. 2C). By contrast, in the case of four-repeat htau24, all compounds have a low efficiency (Fig. 2J), the best values are achieved for PHF016 and PHF005 (DC50 values in the 10–40 μm range). Thus, four-repeat full-length tau appears to be more stable than three-repeat tau, both in the assembly inhibition and in the disassembly assay. The influence of heparin was tested by comparing the disassembly of filaments made from K18ΔK280 without or with heparin (Fig. 2, K and L, and Table I). As in the assembly inhibition assay, the results are broadly comparable, showing that heparin does not have a major influence on the results (DC50 values range from 1 to 7.5 μm). As controls we performed the disassembly experiments with the tryptophan assay (Fig. 3, D–F) at compound concentrations of 60 μm. In the tryptophan assay the compounds are able to dissolve K19 filaments (Fig. 3D), except daunorubicin (Fig. 3D, sixth entry). All other compounds yield emission maxima after treatment at ∼350–353 nm, close to the value of soluble tau, indicating a disassembly efficiency of ∼80–90%. In the case of K18 filaments (Fig. 3E), all compounds show a significantly lower efficiency of depolymerization; only PHF005 is a strong inhibitor under these conditions (80%), whereas emodin, adriamycin, and PHF016 exhibit not more than 10% efficiency. This ranking is consistent with the assembly inhibition assay (Fig. 3B). In the case of K18ΔK280 (Fig. 3F), the efficiency of disassembly is further reduced, but the ranking remains comparable with that of K18 (compare Fig. 3E), as well as to the assembly inhibition assay (Fig. 3C). In these cases, PHF005 remains the most potent agent for depolymerizing PHFs (ninth entry). As a third method we used a filter trap assay (Fig. 4). This assay monitors aggregated tau trapped on a membrane filter, whereas soluble protein is washed through. Therefore the technique preferably detects larger filaments, similar to the ThS assay. The compounds show similar disassembly activities as the ThS assay; emodin was most effective with a DC50 of ∼0.5 μm. All of the results were confirmed by electron microscopy. Fig. 5 illustrates examples of PHFs in the process of disassembly after overnight incubation with inhibitors. The filaments are seen in various stages of shortening or breaking, and the background contains numerous aggregates of undefined structure. The general rule emerging from these experiments is that the compounds are more efficient in inhibiting de novo formation of PHFs than in depolymerizing preformed ones. This is revealed by the ThS fluorescence assay, by the filter trap assay, by the tryptophan fluorescence shift assay, and by electron microscopy and holds for all tau constructs and isoforms.

They are localized to Golgi and post-Golgi endocytic compartments as follows: mid- to trans-Golgi, NHE8; trans-Golgi network, NHE7; early recycling endosomes, NHE6; and late recycling endosomes, NHE9. No significant localization of these NHEs was observed in lysosomes. The distribution of these NHEs is not discrete in the cells, and there is partial overlap with other isoforms, suggesting that the intracellular localization of the NHEs is established by the balance of transport in and out of the post-Golgi compartments as the dynamic membrane trafficking. The overexpression of NHE isoforms increased the luminal pH of the compartments in which the protein resided from the mildly acidic pH to the cytosolic pH, suggesting that their in vivo function is to regulate the pH and monovalent cation concentration in these organelles. We propose that the specific NHE isoforms contribute to the maintenance of the unique acidic pH values of the Golgi and post-Golgi compartments in the cell.

We propose that the specific NHE isoforms contribute to the maintenance of the unique acidic pH values of the Golgi and post-Golgi compartments in the cell. The luminal ionic composition of intracellular compartments differs from the cytoplasm, and each compartment is characterized by a unique, organelle-specific ion concentration. This specific ionic composition is thought to be an important determinant for organelle function and is maintained by the concerted action of ion transport carriers on the membrane (1Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Saier Jr., M.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 190: 61-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Organelles of the secretory and endocytic pathways exhibit differential weak acidity in their lumen with a gradient of pH values decreasing toward the trafficking destination, from ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BTP, BisTris propane; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger protein; RT, reverse transcription; aa, amino acids; ORF, open reading frame; TGN, trans-Golgi network; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; nt, nucleotides; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; V-ATPase, vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase.

Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This progressive acidification is essential for compartmentalizing cellular events, such as post-translational modifications, sorting of newly synthesized proteins into the secretory pathway, and the degradation or recycling of internalized ligand-receptor complexes and fluid-phase solutes in the endocytic pathway (3Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Even pH differences of less than 0.5 between organelles can be essential for the compartmentalizing cellular events (6Schmidt W.K. Moore H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1271-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The differential ionic milieu of the organelles is maintained by a suite of ion carriers on the membrane, including pumps, channels, and transporters. Luminal acidity is primarily generated by the vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) (4Futai M. Oka T. Sun-Wada G. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Because the V-ATPase is electrogenic, the pumping activity could be affected by membrane potential and availability of permeant counterions such as chloride and potassium. In vitro studies using isolated endosomes and Golgi suggested a critical role for Cl- in shunting the inside-positive membrane potential generated by H+ pumping (7Glickman J. Croen K. Kelly S. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 8Van Dyke R.W. Hornick C.A. Belcher J. Scharschmidt B.F. Havel R.J. J. Biol.

However, although Cl- and K+ serve as counterions for H+ pumping, their conductances on the Golgi complex and the TGN were large compared with the rate of H+ pumping, arguing against modulation of Cl- and K+ conductances as the mechanism for pH regulation and suggesting that the electrical potential across the membrane is not a determinant of steady-state pH in the Golgi and TGN (10Demaurex N.

Instead, the steady-state pH is thought to be controlled by the balance between the rate of H+ pumping by V-ATPase and the magnitude of H+ leak from the organelle lumen. The H+ leak mechanism is postulated based on the rapid dissipation of the proton gradient across the membrane after inhibiting the V-ATPase with bafilomycin A1, however the molecular mechanism is still unknown (10Demaurex N.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The decreasing pH values of organelles along the secretory pathway is established by gradually increasing the density of active H+-pumps from the ER to the Golgi while concomitantly decreasing the H+ permeability from ER to Golgi to secretory granules (14Wu M.M.

Thus, the H+ leak acts as a key determinant of organellar pH. These data emphasize the importance of identifying the molecular components of this system, which could conceivably involve proton channels, proton-coupled cotransporters, or proton-exchanging transporters. Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) proteins are integral membrane proteins that mediate electroneutral exchange of H+ for Na+ and K+ across the membrane, down their concentration gradients (16Bianchini L. Poussegur J. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 337-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NHEs are composed of an N-terminal 10–12 membrane-spanning domain mediating the ion exchange and a large hydrophilic C-terminal domain that serves a regulatory function in ion transport (17Wakabayashi S.

Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F467-F473Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane NHEs are known to participate in the maintenance of intracellular pH and cell volume and are also crucial for absorption of Na+ across epithelia (19Orlowski J. Grinstein S.

Recently, it was reported that NHE7 on the trans-Golgi network and the plant vacuolar homologue AtNHX1 catalyze low affinity transport of Na+ and K+ in exchange for H+ (29Numata M. Orlowski J. J.

In this study, we characterized organellar alkali-cation/proton exchanger proteins and found that four NHE isoforms are distributed to Golgi and post-Golgi compartments. From these observations we suggest a mechanism regulating the luminal pH and cation composition of the intracellular compartments by NHEs.

Sequencing analysis of the cDNA suggested that this clone was missing coding information of ∼0.5 kbp at the 5′ region (corresponding to amino acids 1–169 in the mouse homologue). Two mouse EST clones (accession numbers BF782177 and BF787440) encoding NHE8 were obtained from Invitrogen. The nucleotide sequence of BF787440 has been deposited in the DDBJ/GenBank™ (accession number AB089793). A human EST clone (accession number BI600396) encoding NHE9 was obtained from Invitrogen. This EST clone contained the entire NHE9 ORF but carried nonsense (C→A) and frameshift (insertion of C) mutations at positions of 26 and 272 nt from the initiation ATG. We cloned cDNA corresponding to NHE9 ORF by reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR amplification of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human cultured cell lines, HEp2, HEK293, HeLa, and Caco-2, using the following primers: 5′-CTAAGGAATCCCAAGAAGACTGGGG-3′ and 5′-TGATTACATCTGTACTCTTCATGCC-3′. The nucleotide sequence of the NHE9 cDNA was determined by sequencing three independent PCR products from each cell line and was deposited in the DDBJ/GenBank™ (accession number AB089794). A human NHE6 cDNA clone, KIAA0267, was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Kisarazu, Japan). Human NHE7 cDNA was cloned by PCR amplification as follows. A cDNA fragment of the ORF (160 nt from initiation ATG to the termination codon) was amplified from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from HEK293 cells. The 159-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the 5′-end of ORF was cloned by amplifying a human genome clone, accession number AL050307 (provided by Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA). The full-length NHE7 ORF was reconstituted by PCR, and the integrity of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Northern Blotting and RT-PCR—A human poly(A)+ RNA blot (1 μg/lane, Clontech) was probed with a 1.2-kbp PCR fragment of human NHE8 (the coding region of the KIAA0939 clone) or human NHE9 (263–1535 nt from the initiation codon). The probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by the random primer method and hybridized at 68 °C for 1 h in the ExpressHyb™ solution (Clontech). The membrane filter was washed extensively under high stringent conditions, and the radioactive signals were then analyzed by using a PhosphorImager (BAS1800, FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan). For RT-PCR analysis, poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from human cell lines using biotinylated oligo(dT) and streptavidin-conjugated magnetic resin, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI), and reverse-transcribed with BcaBEST reverse transcriptase and random 9-mer primers (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Subsequent PCRs were performed using the following primers: NHE6, 5′-GAAGTGCAGTCAAGTCCAACTACCT-3′ and 5′-CGGAAAAGCCAAGCACTCTCTGCTT-3′ (for first PCR); 5′-AGTGCTGTCCTCCTCAATAGTGGCA-3′ and 5′-TGAACAGTGTCAGCCCCATGTAGGA-3′ (for second PCR); NHE7, 5′-CCCAGTGACTGTGCTGGCGATATTT-3′ and 5′-TCCTGTTTTGTCCGGTTTCCTCTGG-3′; NHE8, 5′-ATTTTACAGGCTGATGTAATCTCTA-3′ and 5′-TCCAAGGAAGGCGTTTTCCTCAAGT-3′; NHE9, 5′-GGGGAATTCATGGAGAGACAGTCAAGGGTTATG-3′ and 5′-GGGGTCGACTTAATTCAACTGGGATTGACC-3′. The PCRs were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed according to standard protocols (40Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Amplification of the target cDNA fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. Plasmid Construction—Mammalian expression plasmids for NHE8 tagged with FLAG tag and ECFP at the C terminus were constructed by introducing an EcoRI-SphI DNA fragment encoding NHE8 and an SphI-SalI DNA fragment encoding the FLAG sequence with the termination codon into pcDNA3.1-mycHisA(-) (Invitrogen), and an EcoRI-BamHI fragment encoding NHE8 lacking the termination codon into pECFP-N1 (Clontech), respectively. The expression plasmid for NHE9 tagged with Myc tag or ECFP was generated by introducing the EcoRI-SalI and NheI-SacI PCR fragments encoding NHE9 lacking the termination codon into pcDNA3.1-mycHisA(-) (Invitrogen) or pECFP-N1 (Invitrogen), respectively. Expression plasmids for human NHE6-HA and NHE7-T7 were constructed by introducing the EcoRI-BamHI PCR fragment encoding NHE6-HA or NHE7-T7 without termination codons into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech). The expression plasmids for human NHE6-ECFP were constructed by introducing the EcoRI-BamHI PCR fragment encoding NHE6-HA lacking a termination codon into pECFP-N1. The linker sequences between NHEs and epitope tags or ECFP are as follows: NHE8-“GMQ”-FLAG, NHE8-“PDPPVAT”-ECFP, NHE9-“VDRSELGTKLGP”-Myc-“NSAVD”-(His)6, NHE9-“VDRSELKLRILQSTVPRARDPPVAT”-ECFP, NHE6-HA-“RDPSPPW”, NHE6-HA-“RDPPVAT”-ECFP, and NHE7-T7-“RDPSSVPSLSLNR.” The expression plasmids for GalT-GFPs and VAMP3-GFPs were constructed by inserting PCR fragments encoding the N-terminal 82 aa of human GalT (β-1,4-galactosyltransferase) and rat VAMP3 into the multiple cloning sites of pEGFP-N3 and pEYFP-N1 (Clontech), respectively. The linker sequences between organelle markers and GFPs are as follows: GalT- “PRSIAT”-EGFP, GalT- “PPVAT”-EYFP, VAMP3-“KLSNSAVDGTAGPGSIAT”-EGFP, and VAMP3-“KLRILQSTVPRARDPPVAT”-EYFP. Yeast expression plasmids for mouse NHE8 and human NHE9 were constructed by introducing the EcoRI-SphI PCR fragment of the NHE8 or NHE9 ORF, and the SphI-SalI DNA fragment encoding His6 or EGFP into the EcoRI-SalI site of yeast expression plasmid pKT10 (41Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of “GMQ” and “GMP” were added between the NHE coding sequences and the His6 and EGFP, respectively. Escherichia coli expression plasmids for His6-tagged enhanced GFP mutants were constructed as follows. An HincII fragment encoding EGFP (F64L and S65T) from pEGFP-N3 was introduced into the same site of pQE9 to generate an expression plasmid for 6xHis-EGFP (pQE9-EGFP). BamHI-HincII fragments encoding ECFP (F64L, S65T, Y66W, N146I, M153T, and V163A) from pECFP-N1 (Clontech) and EYFP (S65G, V68L, S72A, and T203Y) from pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) were introduced into the BamHI-HincII site of pQE10 to generate expression plasmids for 6xHis-ECFP (pQE10-ECFP) and 6xHis-EYFP (pQE10-EYFP). This places the sequences encoding the GFP mutants downstream of the His6 tag, and the plasmids encode fusion proteins of “MRGSHHHHHHGSVDGTAGPGSIAT”-EGFP (pQE9-EGFP) and “MRGSHHHHHHTDPPVAT”-ECFP/EYFP (pQE10-ECFP/pQE10-EYFP). Spectroscopy and pH Titration of EGFP Mutants in Vitro—The recombinant 6xHis-GFP mutants were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography using a linear gradient of 0–1 m imidazole in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.3 m NaCl. Titrations of GFP fluorescence versus pH were performed by cuvette fluorometry. Purified GFPs (10 μg/ml, 134-fold dilution of the purified proteins) were dissolved in either 0.2 m sodium phosphate (pH 8.0 to pH 5.0) or 0.1 m sodium phosphate and 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5 and pH 4.0). The filters used for excitation were 480 nm ± 10 nm (EGFP), 440 nm ± 10 nm (ECFP), and 505 nm ± 10 nm (EYFP). Antibodies—The rabbit polyclonal anti-NHE8 antibody was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with the bacterially expressed C-terminal peptides of human NHE8 (105 amino acid residues), followed by affinity purification. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained from commercial sources as follows: anti-Myc (clone 9E10) and anti-HA (clone 12CA5), Roche Diagnostics; anti-FLAG (clone M2), Sigma; anti-T7, Novagen (Madison, WI); anti-GM130 (clone 35), Transduction Laboratories; and anti-CI-M6PR antibody, Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). Rabbit polyclonal anti-HA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit and mouse IgG were purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Alexa488- and Alexa-546-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Purification of NHE8 Expressed in Yeast—Yeast TYY3 cells expressing NHE8–6xHis or NHE8(E220Q,D225N)-6xHis were cultured in synthetic medium containing 2% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, and appropriate supplements. The cells (8000 A600 units) were lysed in 70 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) by two passes through a French press, followed by centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (S0.5) was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting pellet fraction (P100) was resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mg of protein/ml). The solution was mixed with 4 volumes of lysis buffer containing 0.5% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM), 20% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole and was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Insoluble material was removed by centrifuging at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (S30) was applied to a 1-ml column of Hi-Trap Chelating HP charged with Ni2+. The column was washed with lysis buffer containing 0.15% DDM, 20% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole, followed by elution buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 0.075% DDM) containing 80 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (80–400 mm). The protein eluted in the 200–240 mm fractions was concentrated by using a centrifugal concentrator with a 10-kDa cut-off (Ultrafree-MC 10,000 NMWL, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Reconstitution of NHE8 Proteins into Liposomes—For reconstitution of NHE8 proteins into liposomes, we used the protocol developed previously for reconstitution of the purified His6-tagged H+-ATPase, AHA2, and Na+/H+ exchanger, AtNHX1 (33Venema K.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39167-39173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NHE8 (50 μg) was mixed with 2.34 mg of soybean phospholipids type II-S (Sigma) in a total volume of 208 μl of reconstitution buffer (20 mm BTP-MES (pH 7.5), 25 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm pyranine). The sample was solubilized by addition of 12 μl of 1 mn-octyl-β-d-glucoside and loaded onto a 2.5-ml spin column filled with Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Biosciences) preloaded with 2.5 mm pyranine in reconstitution buffer. After centrifugation for 5 min at 180 × g, the eluate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 mg of wet Bio-Beads (SM-2, Bio-Rad) and again passed over a G-50 spin column. Measurement of Na+/H+Exchange in Vitro—Pyranine fluorescence was recorded at 463 nm excitation wavelength and 510 nm emission wavelength. Fluorescence of the sample was adjusted to appropriate levels by diluting the sample with reconstitution buffer. The liposomes containing NHE8 were diluted in the reconstitution buffer without (NH4)2SO4 and pyranine in a 2-ml reaction cuvette held at 25 °C. The 40-fold NH4+ dilution resulted in acid loading of the vesicles because of outward diffusion of NH3 (44Nakamura T. Hsu C. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 678-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting pH inside the vesicles determined from the fluorescence of pyranine was 5.73. Thereafter, inward cation gradients were imposed by the addition of NaCl outside the vesicles. Proton efflux coupled to cation influx was monitored by the increase of pyranine fluorescence. The initial rate of fluorescence variation after the addition of cations (ΔF·min-1) was used to determine the affinity for cations and maximum initial rate of vesicle alkalinization by Hanes-Woolf plotting. For radioactive sodium uptake, the liposomes (12.5 μl) were suspended in 0.5 ml of reaction buffer (20 mm BTP-MES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 160 mm22NaCl (0.23 MBq/mmol)). At various times, ice-cold reaction buffer (1.5 ml) without 22Na+ was added to stop the reaction. The sample was applied to a membrane filter (HATF, 0.45-μm pore size, Millipore, Billerica, MA), washed three times with 2 ml of reaction buffer without NaCl, and then dried for quantitation of radioactivity. The background radioactivity was determined by adding 25 mm (NH4)2SO4 to the reaction buffer prior to starting the reaction. Radioactivity was measured with an ACSII liquid scintillation counter (Amersham Biosciences) and a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and then permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% saponin, and 2% normal goat serum (34Nakamura N. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with primary antibodies against NHE proteins, the epitope tags, or organelle marker proteins and then stained with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, samples were filled with 10% glycerol and then observed under an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). COS7 cells were transfected with pCMV-NHE6-HA or pcDNA3.1-NHE9-mycHis and incubated for 2 days. Cells were serum-starved for 30 min at 37 °C to deplete them of transferrin, chilled on ice, and allowed to bind Alexa 594-Tfn (60 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 45 min on ice. Cells were washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C. After incubation for the indicated times, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2134467287,"Fatty livers of obese fa/fa rats are vulnerable to injury when challenged by insults such as endotoxin, ischemia-reperfusion or acute ethanol treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a high-fat diet can act as a ""second hit"" and cause progression to liver injury in obese fa/fa rats compared with lean Fa/? rats. Accordingly, obese fa/fa rats and their lean littermates were fed a diet low in fat (12% of total calories) or a diet with 60% calories as lard for 8 weeks. Hyperglycemia and steatohepatitis occurred in the fa/fa rats fed the high-fat diet. This was accompanied by liver injury as assessed by alanine aminotransferase, hematoxilin and eosin staining, increased TNFalpha and stellate cell-derived TGFbeta, collagen deposition, and up-regulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin. Active MMP13 decreased in fa/fa rats independently of the diet, and TIMP1 expression increased with the high-fat diet, especially in fa/fa rats. Although UCP2 expression was higher in fa/fa rats regardless of the diet, minor changes in ATP levels were observed. Oxidative stress occurred in the fa/fa rats fed the high-fat diet as lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls were elevated, while glutathione and antioxidant enzymes were very low. Expression and activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 and xanthine oxidase activity were down-regulated in fa/fa compared with Fa/? rats, and no effect was seen by the high-fat diet. However, NADPH oxidase activity increased 2.5-fold in fa/fa rats fed with the high-fat diet. In summary, a high-fat diet induces liver injury in fa/fa rats leading to periportal fibrosis. A role for oxidative stress is suggested via increased NADPH oxidase activity, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl formation, and low antioxidant defense."
https://openalex.org/W2069875612,"Apoptosis-inducing ligand 2 (Apo2L), also called tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), triggers programmed cell death in various types of cancer cells but not in most normal cells. Apo2L/TRAIL is a homotrimeric protein that interacts with five receptors: death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5 mediate apoptosis activation, whereas decoy receptor 1 (DcR1), DcR2, and osteoprotegerin counteract this function. Many cancer cell lines express both DR4 and DR5, and each of these receptors can initiate apoptosis independently of the other. However, the relative contribution of DR4 and DR5 to ligand-induced apoptosis is unknown. To investigate this question, we generated death receptor-selective Apo2L/TRAIL variants using a novel approach that enables phage display of mutated trimeric proteins. Selective binding to DR4 or DR5 was achieved with three to six-ligand amino acid substitutions. The DR4-selective Apo2L/TRAIL variants examined in this study showed a markedly reduced ability to trigger apoptosis, whereas the DR5-selective variants had minimally decreased or slightly increased apoptosis-inducing activity. These results suggest that DR5 may contribute more than DR4 to Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells that express both death receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2080032926,"TGF-β is a multifunctional cytokine known to exert its biological effects through a variety of signaling pathways of which Smad signaling is considered to be the main mediator. At present, the Smad-independent pathways, their interactions with each other, and their roles in TGF-β-mediated growth inhibitory effects are not well understood. To address these questions, we have utilized a human breast cancer cell line MCF10CA1h and demonstrate that p38 MAP kinase and Rho/ROCK pathways together with Smad2 and Smad3 are necessary for TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition of this cell line. We show that Smad2/3 are indispensable for TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, and that both p38 and Rho/ROCK pathways affect the linker region phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Further, by using Smad3 mutated at the putative phosphorylation sites in the linker region, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser203 and Ser207 residues is required for the full transactivation potential of Smad3, and that these residues are targets of the p38 and Rho/ROCK pathways. We demonstrate that activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway is necessary for the full transcriptional activation potential of Smad2/Smad3 by TGF-β, whereas activity of Rho/ROCK is necessary for both down-regulation of c-Myc protein and up-regulation of p21waf1 protein, directly interfering with p21waf1 transcription. Our results not only implicate Rho/ROCK and p38 MAPK pathways as necessary for TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, but also demonstrate their individual contributions and the basis for their cooperation with each other.

It also regulates the function and maturation of immature hematopoietic cells, activated B and T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Since TGF-β is pleotropic in nature, its biological activity is tightly regulated. It belongs to a family consisting of structurally related polypeptides, including TGF-βs, activins, and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), all of which regulate pivotal biological functions (8Dennler S. ten Goumans M.J. Dijke P. J. Leukoc Biol. 2002; 71: 731-740PubMed Google Scholar, 9Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). The most well studied TGF-β response in normal epithelial cells is growth inhibition. TGF-β causes G1 cell-cycle arrest by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity via induction of p15INK4b and p21waf1 (2Feng X.H. Lin X. Derynck R.

Another key event in the TGF-β program of growth arrest is repression of c-Myc expression, and this response has been shown to be selectively lost in certain tumor cell lines, which have escaped from inhibition of growth by TGF-β (11Chen C.R.

Dev. 2002; 12: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). In early phases, when cells are still sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β, it typically acts as a tumor suppressor. However, in late stages where it acts as a pro-metastatic agent, cells typically have escaped selectively from the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β (14Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3698-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), even though certain pathways of TGF-β signaling remain functional in these cells (13Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Curr. Opin.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6954-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Binding of ligand to its receptor serine/threonine kinase leads to the formation of a heteromeric transmembrane receptor complex, which then phosphorylates Smad protein substrates. Upon activation, Smads hetero-oligomerize with Smad4, translocate to the nucleus, and either activate or repress their target genes. The genes encoding the TGF-β receptors (TβRs) and Smads have been found to be genetically altered in a small percentage of human cancers. In particular, TβR-II is frequently mutated in colon and gastric cancers with a microsatellite instability phenotype (21Markowitz S.D. Roberts A.B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Mutations and/or functional loss of Smad4, Smad2, and Smad3 all have been documented (22Inman G.J.

Whether these changes lead directly to the loss of sensitivity to inhibition of growth by TGF-β is not known, although it has been shown that in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines resistant to inhibition of growth by TGF-β, Smad complexes have a shorter nuclear residence time, which results in an inability to maintain expression of the CDK inhibitor, p21waf1 (14Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3698-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although the Smad pathway is the main mediator of TGF-β signaling, recent studies have implicated other pathways such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), and p70S6 kinase either as mediators or modulators of TGF-β-dependent biological effects, the molecular details of which are still being studied (16de Caestecker M.P. Piek E. Roberts A.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1388-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β can both activate MAP kinase pathways directly, and TGF-β-dependent Smad signaling can cooperate with these pathways when they are activated by other means leading to a pro-oncogenic response (27Oft M. Heider K.H. Beug H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that aberrant activation of MAP kinase pathways may play an important role in diverting the TGF-β response toward a pro-oncogenic outcome. Thus, for example, TGF-β may cooperate with activated Ras to promote invasive, metastatic disease (28Park B.J. Park J.I. Byun D.S. Park J.H. Chi S.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3031-3038PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yan Z. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1555-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In keratinocytes, stimulation of invasion by TGF-β is dependent on Ras/MAPK/MEK signaling, and secretion of several metalloproteinases is dependent on p38 MAP kinase (30Johansson N. Ala-aho R. Uitto V. Grenman R. Fusenig N.E. Lopez-Otin C. Kahari V.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 227-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), implicated in acquisition of an aggressive phenotype in certain cancers, can require cooperation between MAP kinase and Smad pathways (31Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 32Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. ten Heldin C.H. Dijke P. J.

In other cases, EMT has been shown to be Smad-independent utilizing the RhoA and PI 3-kinase pathways (34Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36803-36810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Among the other non-Smad pathways that might be implicated in a role in growth control by TGF-β, p38 MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase signaling have been shown to be involved in the pro-survival activity in mesenchymal cells/fibroblasts (36Horowitz J.C. Lee D.Y. Waghray M. Keshamouni V.G. Thomas P.E. Zhang H. Cui Z. Thannickal V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 23: 23Google Scholar). p38 MAP kinase pathway is required for the sumoylation, and thereby transcriptional activity of Smad4 by protein inhibitors of activated Stat (PIAS) proteins (37Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 26: 26Google Scholar). At the level of cell cycle progression, it was shown that p38 MAP kinase and SAP/JNK activation by TGF-β leads to the stabilization of p21waf1 protein in a Smad-independent manner and leads to growth arrest in a human colon carcinoma cell line HD3 (38Kim G.Y. Mercer S.E. Ewton D.Z. Yan Z. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29792-29802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). p38 MAPK is also necessary for TGF-β-mediated cell adhesion (39Hayes S.A. Huang X. Kambhampati S. Platanias L.C. Bergan R.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4841-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), collagenase-3 expression (40Selvamurugan N. Fung Z. Partridge N.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), thrombospondin-1 expression, and apoptosis (41Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H.

To identify the role of Smad-independent pathways that are activated by TGF-β and to study their role in Smad-dependent biological effects on growth, we have utilized the MCF10CA1h cell line, which is derived from the MCF10At1k Ras-transformed human breast cancer cell line (43Dawson P.J. Wolman S.R. Tait L. Heppner G.H. Miller F.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 313-319PubMed Google Scholar, 44Santner S.J. Dawson P.J. Tait L. Soule H.D. Eliason J. Mohamed A.N. Wolman S.R. Heppner G.H.

Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that in addition to Smad signaling, TGF-β activates Rho and p38 pathways and that these pathways contribute in both TGF-β-dependent and TGF-β-independent modes to inhibition of growth by TGF-β. Further investigation revealed that these pathways modulate Smad function in a positive manner by affecting their linker region phosphorylation, as well as their transcriptional activation potential. Contrary to earlier reports, p21waf1 was found not to be a direct target for TGF-β-mediated activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway (38Kim G.Y. Mercer S.E. Ewton D.Z. Yan Z. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29792-29802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Instead, in MCF10CA1h cells, we found the Rho/ROCK pathway to be necessary for the up-regulation of p21waf1 protein. Interestingly, our results also showed that activation of Rho/ROCK is necessary for the down-regulation of c-Myc protein. Overall, our results demonstrate a complex interplay between Smad, p38 MAP kinase, and Rho pathways in TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition. Cell Culture and Reagents—MCF10CA1h cells were obtained from Dr. Fred Miller (Barbara Ann Kermanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI). Cells were grown in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 5% horse serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The amphotropic retroviral packaging cell line Phoenix-A was obtained from Dr. Rick Derynck, and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Specific inhibitors for MEK (PD98059), p38 MAP kinase (SB203580), ROCK (Y-27632), and TGF-β type-I receptor Alk5 (SB431542) were obtained from Glaxo. TGF-β1 was from R&D Systems, Inc., Annapolis, MD. Retroviral Constructs—Retroviral expression vector (LPCX) constructs coding for either the full-length Smad3 or a C-terminally truncated (lacking the SSVS-motif of Smad3) Smad3 sequence (Smad3ΔC) were obtained from Dr. Rick Derynck. LPCX vector has puromycin resistance marker for selecting cells, which have stable retroviral integration. Stable Expression of Wild-type or Dominant-negative Smad3—For retroviral packaging, Phoenix-A cells were plated 3 × 106 cells/9-cm tissue culture dish 24 h before transfection. Transfection was done by calcium phosphate method, using 10 μg of DNA per plate. Cell culture medium containing the recombinant viruses was collected 36 h after transfection and filtered through 0.45-μm filters to remove cell debris. For retroviral infection, MCF10CA1h cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells in 9-cm plates and 4 ml/plate of retroviral supernatants together with 4 μg/ml (final) of polybrene (Sigma) was added. Cells were placed in fresh growth medium after 5 h of infection and allowed to grow. Selection with 2 μg/ml of puromycin was started 48 h of infection for 5 days. Thereafter, cells were maintained in 200 ng/ml of puromycin. Thymidine Incorporation and Cell Growth Assays—Cell survival was estimated by [3H]thymidine (1 mCi/ml stock; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) incorporation for 2 h as previously described (46Tian F. DaCosta Byfield S. Parks W.T. Yoo S. Felici A. Tang B. Piek E. Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8284-8292PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, MCF10 CA1h were seeded 3000 cells/well in a 96-well plate in complete growth medium and allowed to adhere properly for 5 h. Then they were shifted to low serum medium containing 0.5% horse serum and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Synthetic inhibitors were added to the cells at various concentrations 1 h prior to the addition of TGF-β. Cells were treated either with TGF-β alone or together with various inhibitors for 24 h. To each well, 1μCi of [3H]thymidine was added and incubated for 3 h. Cells were trypsinized in 100 μl/well of trypsin for 30 min and were harvested using the MicroBeta Harvester. Thymidine incorporation was detected using a scintillation counter. The cell viability assay was performed by seeding MCF10CA1h cells (12,000 cells/well in 24-well plate) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 containing 0.5% horse serum. Cells were treated for 48 h with TGF-β alone or together with various inhibitors after which live cells were counted using trypan blue staining. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Cells growing under subconfluence conditions in complete growth medium were starved (0.5% horse serum) for 12 h and treated with 2 ng/ml of TGF-β alone or together with inhibitors as desired. Nuclear fractions were prepared by extracting the cells (after extracting cytoplasmic fractions) with 2.5 volumes per volume pellet of hypertonic nuclear buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, and was completed with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mix of protease inhibitors from Roche Applied Science). Protein quantification was done with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—For preparing total cell extracts, cells were seeded at subconfluence in complete growth medium and allowed to adhere properly. Then they were shifted to starvation medium with 0.5% horse serum for 12–18 h and then treated with 2 ng/ml of TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Inc., Annapolis, MD) as desired. Total cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm Nacl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Proteins extracts were quantified by the BCA protein assay kit separated on SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions and were transferred onto Immunobilon™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). Blots were hybridized with specific primary antibodies, and antigen-specific signal was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Anti-Smad2 and -Smad3 antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. So. San Francisco, CA; anti-Smad4, p21waf1, and c-Myc antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc; anti-phospho-Smad2 and phospho-Smad3 antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. Michael Reiss, Cancer Institute of New Jersey; anti-total and phospho-p38, ERK, ATF-2, antibodies, and anti-total pRb (human) antibodies are from BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA. Antibodies against linker region phosphorylated Smad2/3 (pT178, pT8, pS212, pS207, and pS203) were generously provided by Dr. Fang Liu (Rutgers University). In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro kinase assays for p38 and Rho was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The p38 MAP kinase assay kit is from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA; the Rho activation assay kit is from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY. Expression Vectors, Cell Transfection, and Reporter Assays— MCF10CA1h cells were seeded 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates 18 h prior to transfection in complete growth medium. Cells were transfected with a total of 2 μg/well of either CAGA12-Luc, full-length p21waf1 promoter (kindly provided by Dr. Jane E. Trepel, National Institutes of Health), TIE-Luc (kindly provided by Dr. Xiao-Fan Wang, Duke University), or ARE-Luc and FAST-1 together with pRL-TK (Renilla, for normalization) plasmid DNA using Nucleofector™ KitV (AMAXA Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Linker-mutated Smad2 and Smad3 (EPSM), (47Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) were from Dr. Joan Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) and linker-mutated Smad3 (C2-S3), (48Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Fang Liu (Rutgers University). Dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase and dominant-negative RhoA constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Seong-Jin Kim, NCI, National Institutes of Health. pcDNA3 was used either as a control or as filler. 48 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with medium containing 0.5% horse serum (starvation), and cells were either treated with 2 ng/ml of TGF-β or left untreated for 16–18 h and then were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and Renilla activities were determined by VICTOR2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Effect of TGF-β on MCF10CA1h Cell Growth—Treatment of MCF10CA1h cells with TGF-β led to a profound inhibition of overall proliferation rate as detected by using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Thymidine incorporation was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner and was reduced by about 80% in the presence of 10 ng/ml of TGF-β (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when the number of live cells was counted before and after TGF-β treatment for 48 h (Fig. 1B). In order to identify mechanisms contributing to this growth inhibition, we checked the levels of p21waf1 and c-Myc, which regulate cell growth and proliferation. Western analysis showed an induction of p21waf1 protein with TGF-β treatment starting at 1 h, which reached maximal levels after 6 h (Fig. 1C). Levels of c-Myc oncoprotein were down-regulated as early as 1 h after treatment with TGF-β (Fig. 1E). Another growth regulatory protein, Retinoblastoma (pRb), which is a downstream target for the p21waf1, mediates growth suppressive effects in its hypophosphorylated form. Hypophosphorylation of pRb was detected after 12 h of treatment with TGF-β in MCF10CA1h cells (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the growth inhibition of these cells by TGF-β is accompanied by the up-regulation of p21waf1, hypophosphorylation of pRb and down-regulation of c-Myc protein, events typically associated with inhibition of cell growth by TGF-β (49Moustakas A. Pardali K. Gaal A. Heldin C.H. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 82: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Signaling Pathways Activated by TGF-β—In MCF10CA1h cells, both Smad2 and Smad3 were C-terminally phosphorylated after treatment with TGF-β for 5 min, and the phosphorylation persisted for about 3 h (Fig. 2A). TGF-β has also been shown to activate other pathways including the MAP kinase ERK1/2, JNK, p38, and Rho. These pathways often cooperate with Smad signaling to control gene expression and cell phenotype. Western analysis of total cell extracts from MCF10CA1h cells treated with TGF-β showed an activation of both ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways 5 min after treatment (Fig. 2, B and C). Involvement of Smad Signaling in TGF-β-mediated Growth Inhibition of MCF10CA1h Cells—To investigate the role of Smad proteins in TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, we have utilized two retrovirus infected pools of MCF10CA1h cells, one overexpressing a full-length Smad3 protein and the other expressing a C-terminally truncated version of Smad3 (Smad3ΔC), which was shown earlier to inhibit the activation (phosphorylation) of both endogenous Smad2 and Smad3 proteins (46Tian F. DaCosta Byfield S. Parks W.T. Yoo S. Felici A. Tang B. Piek E. Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8284-8292PubMed Google Scholar). This was achieved by infecting MCF10CA1h cells with the retroviral vector LPCX, coding for the respective protein. Expression of the truncated version of Smad3 inhibited TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3, in agreement with our previous results (46Tian F. DaCosta Byfield S. Parks W.T. Yoo S. Felici A. Tang B. Piek E. Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8284-8292PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). In cells defective in Smad activation, both the down-regulation of c-Myc as well as the hypophosphorylation of pRb were not seen with TGF-β treatment (Fig. 3, B and C), consistent with the demonstration that these cells are refractory to the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β (Fig. 5D) (46Tian F. DaCosta Byfield S. Parks W.T. Yoo S. Felici A. Tang B. Piek E. Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8284-8292PubMed Google Scholar). In cells overexpressing Smad3, phosphorylation of Smad2 was comparable to that of control cells after TGF-β treatment while Smad3 phosphorylation was elevated strongly (Fig. 4A). But in cells overexpressing Smad3, c-Myc was rapidly down-regulated as early as 15 min after addition of TGF-β. The level of hypophosphorylated pRb was comparable to that of the control (Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest that signaling through Smad2 and Smad3, is necessary for TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition in MCF10CA1h cells.Fig. 5A, synthetic inhibitors against p38 MAP kinase, Rho/ROCK, and TβRI (Alk5) antagonize the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β on MCF10CA1h cells. MCF10CA1h cells treated either with TGF-β alone or together with synthetic inhibitors against p38 MAP kinase (SB203580, 5 μm), MEK (PD98059, 25 μm), Alk5 (SB431542, 5 μm), or ROCK (Y27632, 10 μm), and cell proliferation was assessed by using [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Data are the average of triplicates and are expressed as percentage of growth (thymidine incorporation relative to control experiment). B and C, TGF-β treatment leads to p38 MAP kinase and Rho kinase activation in MCF10CA1h cells. Cell lysates from MCF10CA1h cells either non-treated or treated for various periods of time with TGF-β were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. B, p38 MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates using phospho-specific antibodies (Thr180/Tyr182) to p38 MAP kinase. Kinase activity was determined by using ATF-2 fusion protein as substrate. C, from MCF10CA1h cell lysates, GTP-Rho was pulled down using GST-tagged mouse Rhotekin Rho binding domain. Anti-Rho antibodies were used to detect the Rho protein, which represents the GTP-bound kinase active Rho. D and E, activation of Smad2 and Smad3 is required for TGF-β-mediated MCF10CA1h cell growth inhibition. Retroviral-infected MCF10CA1h cell pools expressing either C-terminally truncated Smad3 (Smad3ΔC) (C) or ectopically expressing full-length Smad3 protein (CAS3) (D) were treated with TGF-β alone or together with synthetic inhibitors against p38 MAP kinase (SB203580, 5 μm), or ROCK (Y27632, 10 μm). Cell growth was assessed by using [3H] thymidine incorporation assay.

https://openalex.org/W2160162119,"Insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5) is a peptide that belongs to the relaxin/insulin family, and its receptor has not been identified. In this report, we demonstrate that INSL5 is a specific agonist for GPCR142. Human INSL5 displaces the binding of 125I-relaxin-3 to GPCR142 with a high affinity (Ki = 1.5 nm). In a saturation binding assay, 125I-INSL5 binds GPCR142 with a Kd value of 2.5 nm. In functional guanosine (γ-thio)-triphosphate binding and cAMP accumulation assays, INSL5 potently activates GPCR142 with EC50 values of 1.3 and 1.2 nm, respectively. In addition, INSL5 stimulates Ca2+ mobilization in HEK293 cells expressing GPCR142 and Gα16. Overall, INSL5 behaves as an agonist for GPCR142 similar to relaxin-3. However, unlike relaxin-3, which is also a potent agonist for GPCR135 and LGR7, INSL5 does not activate either GPCR135 or LGR7. INSL5 inhibits 125I-relaxin-3 binding to GPCR135 with a low potency (Ki = 500 nm). A functional assay shows that INSL5 (1 μm) is a weak antagonist for GPCR135. In addition, INSL5 (up to 1 μm) shows no affinity or activity at LGR7 or LGR8 either in a binding assay or a bio-functional assay. Previously, we have demonstrated that GPCR142 mRNA is expressed in peripheral tissues, particularly in the colon. Here we show that INSL5 mRNA is expressed in many peripheral tissues, similar to GPCR142. The high affinity interaction between INSL5 and GPCR142 coupled with their co-evolution and partially overlapping tissue expression patterns strongly suggest that INSL5 is an endogenous ligand for GPCR142.

Relaxin plays multifunctional roles including uterus relaxation, reproductive tissue growth, and collagen remodeling in females (18Sherwood O.D. Knobil E. Neill J.D. 2nd Ed.

In addition, relaxin has been reported to play important roles in nonreproductive functions including wound healing, cardiac protection, and allergic responses (19Sherwood O.D. Endocr.

The tissue expression pattern of GPCR142 (also known as GPR100), which is primarily in peripheral tissues (24Liu C. Chen J. Sutton S. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol.

Furthermore, despite the high conservation of relaxin-3 in different species, GPCR142 is less conserved in the mouse and is a pseudogene in the rat (26Chen J. Kuei C. Sutton S.W. Bonaventure P. Nepomuceno D. Eriste E. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. Liu C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312 (in press)Google Scholar), suggesting that GPCR142 may have a diminished role in rodents and may function as a receptor for a different ligand (other than relaxin-3) in other mammals. Sequence analysis among insulin/relaxin family members indicates that INSL5 shares high homology to relaxin-3 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that it may be an additional ligand for GPCR135, GPCR142, LGR7, or LGR8. In this report, we demonstrate that INSL5 is an agonist for GPCR142 but not for GPCR135, LGR7, or LGR8. Two primers for human INSL5 (forward primer, 5′ GTG GGC TAG AAT ACA TAC GG 3′; reverse primer, 5′ TCT TCA GTG GGC ATC TGT CC 3′), designed according to the published INSL5 cDNA sequence (8Conklin D. Lofton-Day C.E. Haldeman B.A. Ching A. Whitmore T.E. Lok S. Jaspers S. Genomics. 1999; 60: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and two primers for human GPCR142 (forward primer, 5′ TCC TGG TGG CTT CCT TCT TC 3′; reverse primer, 5′ CAG GAG ACA GTA CAG CAC AG 3′), designed according to published GPCR142 cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY394502), were used to PCR-amplify the human INSL5 and GPCR142 cDNA, respectively. Human cDNA pools made from RNAs extracted from different human tissues (BD Biosciences) were used as PCR templates. Human β-actin primers (forward primer, 5′ CAC TCT TCC AGC CTT CCT TC 3′; reverse primer, 5′ CGA TCC ACA CGG AGT ACT TG 3′) were used to amplify the actin cDNA as the internal controls. TaqDNA polymerase with TaqStart antibody (BD Biosciences) was used as the polymerase for PCR. SyBr Green (Molecular Probe) was added to the PCR to monitor the DNA synthesis. The PCRs were performed in a SmartCycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) at conditions of 95 °C for 5 s for denaturing, 62 °C for 7 s for annealing, and 72 °C for 10 s for extension. The PCRs were performed at the above conditions for 40 cycles. The signals were collected after each extension step. Purified human GPCR142, INSL5, and actin PCR products at different concentrations were used in PCRs as the standards for quantitation. The relative abundance of GPCR142 and INSL5 mRNA in different tissues were normalized to the actin expression level for each tissue. Identification of the Signal Peptide Cleavage Site of INSL5—The human INSL5 cDNA was PCR-amplified from human colon cDNA (BD Biosciences) using two primers (forward primer, 5′ ACT AGA GAA TTC GCC ACC ATG AAG GGC TCC ATT TTC ACT CTG TTT TTA TTC TCT G 3′; reverse primer, 5′ GTC ATC AAG CTT TCA CTT GTC ATC GTC ATC CTT GTA GTC GCA AAG AGC ACT CAA ATC AGT CAT 3′). The PCRs were performed at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min and 30 s for 40 cycles. The PCR product was cloned into pCMVsport1 (Invitrogen) between EcoRI and HindIII sites. A FLAG tag coding region was inserted before the 3′ end stop codon. The DNA construct was sequenced to confirm the sequence identity and then transfected into African green monkey kidney COS-7 cells (ATCC number CRL-1651, ATCC, Manassas, VA) by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as the transfection reagent. Three days after transfection, the C-terminally FLAG-tagged INSL5 peptide was first affinity-purified from the conditioned medium by using an anti-FLAG affinity column and then further purified by HPLC by using a C-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The N-terminal sequences of the purified proteins were analyzed by Edman degradation (Molecular Structure Facility, University of California, Davis). Identification of the Cleavage Site between the C-chain and A-chain of INSL5—The N-terminal sequencing results for the C-terminal FLAG-tagged INSL5, which reveals the signal peptide cleavage site, were used to guide the construction of the N-terminal FLAG-tagged INSL5 expression vector. The INSL5 coding region, excluding the signal peptide coding region, was PCR-amplified by using the above C-terminal FLAG-tagged INSL5 expression vector as the template and two primers (forward primer, 5′ ATA TAG GAA TTC GAC GAC GAC GAC AAG AAG GAG TCT GTG AGA CTC TGT GGG C 3′; reverse primer, 5′ ATG ATA AAG CTT TTA GCA AAG AGC ACT CAA ATC AGT CAT 3′). The PCRs were performed at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min 30 s for 20 cycles. The PCR products were then cloned into the modified pCMV-sport1 vector (14Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S.

The resulting DNA construct was sequenced to confirm the sequence identity and co-transfected into COS-7 cells with a furin expression vector (14Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C.

The N-terminally tagged INSL5 peptide secreted into the cell culture medium was affinity-purified with an anti-FLAG column as described for purification of recombinant relaxin-3 (14Liu C. Eriste E.

The N-terminal FLAG tag was removed by digesting the peptides with enterokinase (Novagen, Madison, WI) at 37 °C overnight. The untagged INSL5 peptide was further purified by reverse phase HPLC. The HPLC fractions were lyophilized, reconstituted in water, and tested for ligand activity by using SK-N-MC/β-gal cells stably expressing human GPCR142 (24Liu C. Chen J. Sutton S. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50765-50770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The peptides in active fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) as described previously (14Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jornvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) for molecular mass determination, which was then used to deduce the cleavage sites of the B-chain/C-chain and the C-chain/A-chain. In INSL5, at the junction of the B-chain and the A-chain, there is a natural RWRR sequence, which is a preferred furin cleavage site (27Hosaka M. Nagahama M. Kim W.S. Watanabe T. Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12127-12130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MS results indicated that the cleavage site between the C-chain and the A-chain occurs after a single Arg114 of the INSL5 pre-propeptide. Our results from expression of the N-terminally FLAG-tagged INSL5 indicated that the cleavage after Arg114 is not efficient even when co-expressed with furin. To produce the wild type INSL5 mature peptide at higher efficiency, we engineered the INSL5 expression construct similarly to that of relaxin-3 (14Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C.

The human INSL5 propeptide coding region was PCR-amplified through two steps to introduce a mutation that encodes the artificial furin site (RWRR) between the C-chain and the A-chain. The first step was performed using cloned human INSL5 cDNA as the template and two primers (forward primer, 5′ ATA TAG GAA TTC GAC GAC GAC GAC AAG AAG GAG TCT GTG AGA CTC TGT GGG C 3′; reverse primer, 5′ GTG CAA CAC AAA GTT TGT AAA TCT TGT CTT CGC CAA CGT GAA TGC TTC TTT GAC TTC CAA AGC TC 3′). The PCR was performed at conditions of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 20 cycles. The resulting PCR products from the first step were used as the template for the second step PCR using two primers (forward primer, 5′ ATA TAG GAA TTC GAC GAC GAC GAC AAG AAG GAG TCT GTG AGA CTC TGT GGG C 3′; reverse primer, 5′ ACT AGA AAG CTT TTA GCA AAG AGC ACT CAA ATC AGT CAT GGA ACA GCC ATC AGT GCA ACA CAA AGT TTG TAA ATC TTG TC 3′). The PCR was performed at conditions of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 20 cycles. The product of the second step PCR was then digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into the pCMV-signal FLAG. The resulting DNA construct was sequenced to confirm the sequence identity and then co-expressed with furin in COS-7 cells. The N-terminally FLAG-tagged INSL5 was again first purified by an affinity column, cleaved to removed the N-terminal tag, and then further purified by HPLC as described above. To characterize INSL5 as the possible ligand for GPCR135 and GPCR142, cell membranes from COS-7 cells transiently expressing human GPCR135 or GPCR142 were used in radioligand binding assays by using 125I-relaxin-3 (2,200 Ci/mmol) as the radioligand as described (14Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jornvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol.

Briefly, unlabeled INSL5 or other peptides at various concentrations were added to the membranes from COS-7 cells expressing either GPCR135 or GPCR142 in the presence of 100 pm125I-relaxin-3. The binding assays were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The binding mixtures were then filtered through GFC filters pre-saturated with 0.3% polyethylenimine (Sigma) and washed with cold binding buffer. The bound radioligand was then counted in a microscintillation counter (TopCount/NTX, Packard Instrument Co.) with Microscint-40. To characterize INSL5 as a possible ligand for LGR7 and LGR8, COS-7 cells transiently expressing human LGR7 and LGR8 were used in the whole cell binding assay. Briefly, COS-7 cells transiently expressing LGR7 or LGR8 were detached from culture dishes with phosphate-buffered saline plus 10 mm EDTA and seeded in 96-well opaque culture plates. Radioligand (125I-relaxin-3 for LGR7 and 125I-INSL3 for LGR8) was added to each well at a final concentration of 100 pm in binding buffer (DMEM plus 50 mm HEPES and 1% bovine serum albumin). Unlabeled INSL5 or other peptides at various concentrations were added to the binding mixture as the competitors. The binding assays were carried out at 4 °C for 5 h. The unbound radioligand was removed by aspirating the binding buffer. Cells in the plates were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Fifty microliters of Microscint-40 was then added to each well of the 96-well plate. The plates were then counted in a microscintillation counter (TopCount/NTX, Packard Instrument Co.) to measure the bound radioligand. The results were analyzed by PRISM 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego). The IC50 values are the concentration of unlabeled ligand that inhibits 50% of the total specific binding. To determine the Kd values of INSL5 to GPCR135, GPCR142, LGR7, and LGR8, INSL5 was labeled using chloramine T (Sigma) in the presence of Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The HPLC-purified 125I-INSL5 (4,400 Ci/mmol) at different concentrations was incubated with COS-7 cells (in 24-well tissue culture plates) transiently expressing either GPCR135, GPCR142, LGR7, or LGR8 in binding buffer (DMEM plus 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 1% bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 100 μl). The binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The binding buffer was aspirated, and unbound ligands were removed by washing the cells in the 24-well plates with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The bound ligand was dissolved in 1% SDS plus 1 n NaOH and counted in a gamma counter (Cobra, Quantum, Packard Instrument Co.). The nonspecific binding was assessed by performing the binding assay in the presence of 1 μm human relaxin-3. The results were analyzed using PRISM 3.0 software (GraphPad Software). The GTPγS binding assays were performed as described (24Liu C. Chen J. Sutton S. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50765-50770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes from Chinese hamster ovary CHO-K1 cells (ATCC number CCL-61, ATCC, Manassas, VA) transiently expressing human GPCR142 were used to characterize INSL5. Different concentrations of INSL5 or human relaxin-3 were added to the cell membranes to stimulate the GTPγS incorporation. [35S]GTPγS (1,200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used as the tracer. Mock-transfected cell membranes were used as the negative controls. The results were analyzed using PRISM 3.0 software (GraphPad Software). The EC50 value is the ligand concentration that stimulates 50% of the maximum ligand-induced [35S]GTPγS incorporation. HEK293 cells (ATCC number CRL-1573, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with human GPCR142 and Gα16 expression constructs by using Lipofectamine as the transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, the cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline plus 10 mm EDTA and washed with DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) without phenol red. Cells were then seeded in 96-well black wall poly-d-lysine-coated plates with 4 μm Ca2+ dye Fluo-3 (TEFLABS, Austin TX) in DMEM/F12 plus 2 mm Probenecid (Sigma). Different concentrations of INSL5 or relaxin-3 were added to cells to stimulate intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, which was monitored by a fluorescence imaging plate reader instrument (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The results were analyzed using PRISM 3.0 software. The EC50 value is the ligand concentration that stimulates 50% of maximum Ca2+ release. SK-N-MC/β-gal cells harbor a β-galactosidase gene under the control of a cAMP-response element promoter (28Liu C. Wilson S.J. Kuei C. Lovenberg T.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 121-130PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, elevation in cAMP concentration leads to increased β-galactosidase gene expression, whose activity can be measured as described previously (28Liu C. Wilson S.J. Kuei C. Lovenberg T.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 121-130PubMed Google Scholar). SK-N-MC/β-gal cells were used to establish cell lines stably expressing human GPCR135, GPCR142, LGR7, and LGR8. INSL5 or relaxin-3 at various concentrations was added to cells expressing GPCR135 or GPCR142 to inhibit forskolin (5 μm, Sigma)-stimulated β-galactosidase gene expression. For characterization of LGR7 and LGR8, INSL5, porcine relaxin, or INSL3, at various concentrations, was added to LGR7- or LGR8-expressing cells to induce the β-galactosidase expression. The intracellular β-galactosidase activity was measured by a colorimetric method using Chlorophenol Red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Diagnostics) as the substrate and reading the absorbance at a wavelength of 570 nm. Identification of the Cleavage Sites for INSL5 Maturation and Recombinant Expression of INSL5—Members of the insulin/relaxin family, such as insulin, relaxin, relaxin-3, and INSL3, have a two-subunit (B-chain and A-chain) structure and are processed from their pre-propeptides through the removal of the signal peptides and C-peptides. INSL5 is a member of insulin/relaxin family, and the cleavage sites for the INSL5 pre-propeptide have not been determined. The junction of B-chain and C-chain has an RWRR sequence (Fig. 1A), which is a preferred furin cleavage site and is conserved in relaxin-3. The cleavage sites in relaxin-3 have been proven through investigation of the endogenous peptide as well as the recombinant peptide expressed in mammalian cells (14Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J.

Therefore, we are confident that this cleavage site will be used in the INSL5 maturation process. However, the signal peptide cleavage site and the cleavage site between the C-chain and A-chain have remained unclear. A C-terminally FLAG-tagged INSL5 expression vector was constructed for expression of INSL5 in mammalian cells to determine its cleavage sites for INSL5 maturation, which includes the signal peptidase cleavage site, the cleavage site between the B-chain and C-chain, as well as the site between the C-chain and the A-chain. The C-terminal FLAG-tagged INSL5 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The protein secreted into the medium was purified by an anti-FLAG affinity column and then further purified by a reverse phase HPLC. The N terminus of the purified INSL5 peptide was then analyzed by Edman degradation. The N-terminal sequence analysis results revealed a dominant major sequence, KESVRL—, matching the B-chain sequence of INSL5, indicating that the signal peptidase cleaves between Ser22 and Lys23 of the INSL5 pre-propeptide.

However, the muramic acid moieties of the mycobacterial peptidoglycan are N-glycolylated, not N-acetylated. This is a rare modification seen only in the peptidoglycan of mycobacteria and five other closely related genera of bacteria. The N-glycolylation of sialic acids is a unique carbohydrate modification that has been studied extensively in eukaryotes. However, the significance of the N-glycolylation of bacterial peptidoglycan is unknown. The goal of this project was to identify the gene encoding the hydroxylase responsible for the N-glycolylation of the mycobacterial peptidoglycan. We developed a novel assay for the mycobacterial UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid hydroxylation reaction and demonstrated that Mycobacterium smegmatis has an enzyme activity that can convert UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid to UDP-N-glycolylmuramic acid. We identified the gene namH encoding the mycobacterial UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid hydroxylase by computer data base searching and motif comparisons with the eukaryotic enzymes responsible for the N-glycolyation of sialic acids. The namH gene is not essential for in vitro growth as we were successful in deleting the gene in M. smegmatis. The M. smegmatis mutant is devoid of UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid hydroxylase activity and synthesizes only N-acetylated muropeptide precursors. Furthermore, the mutant exhibits increased susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics and lysozyme. Our studies suggest that the N-glycolylation of mycobacterial peptidoglycan may play a role in lysozyme resistance or may contribute to the structural stability of the cell wall architecture.

In a manner similar to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, the outer portion of the cell envelope of mycobacteria is believed to be arranged as an asymmetric bilayer, with an outer layer composed of various lipids with short to medium length fatty acids, and an inner layer composed of long chain mycolic acids covalently attached to the arabinogalactan polysaccharide (1Brennan P.J. Tuberculosis (Edinb). 2003; 83: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 2Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). The arabinogalactan is in turn covalently attached to the peptidoglycan via an essential rhamnose-N-acetylglucosamine linker, forming the mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex (mAGP) (3Crick D.C.

Peptidoglycan is an essential component of the cell envelope of virtually all bacteria, providing both shape and structural integrity to the cell. Peptidoglycan fragments are also biologically active molecules with toxigenic and immunomodulatory properties (5Burroughs M. Rozdzinski E. Geelen S. Tuomanen E. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Luker K.E. Tyler A.N. Marshall G.R. Goldman W.E. Mol.

In general, peptidoglycan is comprised of a β-1,4-linked polymer of N-acylated muramic acid and glucosamine carbohydrates with cross-linked peptides of varying composition attached to the muramyl moieties. In virtually all bacteria, both carbohydrates in the glycan chain are N-acetylated, however, in the mycobacteria the muramic acid moieties are N-glycolylated instead (9Azuma I. Thomas D.W. Adam A. Ghuysen J.M. Bonaly R. Petit J.F. Lederer E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 208: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Only five other genera of bacteria, Rhodococcus, Tsukamurella, Gordonia, Nocardia, and Micromonospora have N-glycolylmuramic acid in their peptidoglycan (10Holt J.G. Krieg N.R. Sneath P.H.A. Staley J.T. Williams S.T. Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology. 9th Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1994: 597-649Google Scholar). These five genera are closely related to mycobacteria, and all six belong to the class Actinomycetales. Why N-glycolylated muramic acid is only produced by a small number of bacteria is unknown. N-glycolylation is a rare carbohydrate modification seen only for muramic acid in these actinobacteria and for neuraminic acids (sialic acids) in eukaryotes (11Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The N-glycolylation of sialic acids in eukaryotes is known to confer differential biological activities upon the carbohydrates. However, it is not known what role N-glycolylated muramic acid plays in peptidoglycan biology, although it has been hypothesized to stabilize the cell wall through hydrogen bonding (2Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). The initial discovery of N-glycolylated muramic acid (MurNGlyc) 1The abbreviations used are: MurNGlyc, N-glycolylated muramic acid; MurNAc, N-acetylated muramic acid; MOPS, (3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; namH, N-acetylmuramic acid hydroxylase; LB, Luria-Bertani medium; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; MS, mass spectrometry. in mycobacteria prompted the hypothesis that it was synthesized from an N-acetylated muramic acid (MurNAc) precursor by the action of a monooxygenase enzyme, known generically as a hydroxylase (12Petit J.F. Adam A. Wietzerbin-Falszpan J. FEBS Lett. 1970; 6: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These enzymes typically require a proton donor, usually NADH or NADPH, for the reduction of molecular oxygen to water prior to the insertion of an oxygen atom into the substrate and forming a hydroxyl group (13Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Previous work with Mycobacterium phlei established that the production of N-glycolylmuramic acid in mycobacteria likely occurs by the action of an atmospheric oxygen-dependent hydroxylase that converts UDP-MurNAc to UDP-MurNGlyc (14Essers L. Schoop H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 544: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, a soluble activity present in Nocardia asteroides capable of converting UDP-MurNAc to UDP-MurNGlyc in an NADPH-dependent fashion was demonstrated almost 30 years ago (15Gateau O. Bordet C. Michel G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 421: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but since then no UDP-MurNAc hydroxylase has been purified and no gene identified from any bacterial species. Our laboratory studies the biosynthesis of the mycobacterial peptidoglycan and we are particularly interested in determining the significance of N-glycolylmuramic acid in the cell wall of these organisms. In this study, we report the development of a new assay to detect the conversion of UDP-MurNAc to UDP-MurNGlyc and the identification of the namH gene (N-acetylmuramic acid hydroxylase) encoding the mycobacterial UDP-MurNAc hydroxylase. We also show that while the namH gene is not essential for the survival of Mycobacterium smegmatis, a namH deletion mutant is hypersusceptible to β-lactam antibiotics and lysozyme.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PM965 (ept-1 rpsL4 ΔblaS1), and PM979 (ept-1 rpsL4 ΔblaS1 ΔnamH1) were grown in LBT (Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) Tween-80), or on LBT agar, or in Middlebrook 7H9 medium containing ADS (0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V (Roche Applied Science), 0.2% glucose, 0.85% NaCl), 0.05% (w/v) Tween-80, 0.2% (v/v) glycerol), or on Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with ADS, Tween-80, and glycerol. The blaS1 deletion in PM965 and PM979 removes the major β-lactamase enzyme of M. smegmatis and allows us to test the β-lactam susceptibilities of the strains in this study (18Flores A.R. Parsons L.M. Pavelka Jr., M.S. Microbiology. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli K-12 DH10B (F-mcrA Δ[mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC] φ80lacZΔM15 ΔlacX74 deoR recA1 endA1 araΔ139 Δ[ara, leu] 7697 galU galK λ-rpsL [Strr]) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used for plasmid DNA cloning, and E. coli strains were grown on LB agar or in LB medium. All strains were incubated at 37 °C. When necessary hygromycin (Roche Applied Science) or kanamycin was used at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. M. smegmatis strains were electroporated using a standard protocol (19Pavelka Jr., M.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6496-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Sephadex G-25 and Superdex Peptide column were from Amersham Biosciences. Hypersil ODS (C18) column and EZ:faast amino acid analysis kit were from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade water and acetonitrile were purchased from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Plasmid Construction—Plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and DNA fragments were isolated using GeneClean (Bio101, Vista, CA). Suicide plasmids pMP252 (ΔblaS1) and pMP354 (ΔnamH1), were constructed in E. coli K-12 DH10B, whereas the M. smegmatis namH+ complementing plasmid pMP336 was constructed in the M. smegmatis ΔnamH1 mutant PM979. All plasmids were confirmed by restriction mapping and then sequencing by ACGT (Northbrook, IL). Detailed descriptions of the construction of the plasmids used in this study can be obtained from the corresponding author. Construction of the M. smegmatis ΔblaS1ΔnamH1 Mutant PM979 — The M. smegmatis ΔblaS1ΔnamH1 mutant was constructed by allelic exchange using sacB as a counterselectable marker (20Pavelka Jr., M.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4780-4789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was accomplished in a two-step process beginning with the deletion of the M. smegmatis major β-lactamase blaS (18Flores A.R. Parsons L.M. Pavelka Jr., M.S. Microbiology. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in strain PM965. Subsequent allelic exchange of the wild-type namH gene in PM965 was accomplished using pMP354, resulting in the double mutant PM979. Synthesis of Radiolabeled UDP-N-acetylmuramic Acid—Radiolabeled UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid was synthesized from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (2 × 109 Bq/mmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO) labeled with carbon-14 in the acetyl group. The synthesis of UDP-MurNAc was described previously (21Raymond J.B. Price N.P. Pavelka Jr., M.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 229: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but the reaction volumes were reduced to 100 μl and contained UDP-GlcN[14C]Ac (2 × 109 Bq/mmol) (180 nmol), β-NADPH (400 nmol), phosphoenolpyruvate, (PEP, 400 nmol), in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol, and purified, polyhistidine-tagged MurZ (120 μg) and MurB (55 μg). Preparation of M. smegmatis Whole Cell Extracts—M. smegmatis strains harboring plasmids pMV261.hyg or pMP336 (pMV261.hyg bearing namH+)were inoculated into 100 ml 7H9 medium containing hygromycin and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The following morning, cells were harvested at 3,000 × g at an OD600 of ∼0.6–0.8, and cell pellets were washed once in ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The washed cells were centrifuged, and pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of the same buffer containing DNase and RNase at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and protease inhibitor (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Cell suspensions were lysed in a French pressure cell (Aminco, Urbana, IL) three times at 15,000 psi, and cellular debris was pelleted at 10,000 × g. The membrane fraction was obtained after centrifugation of the lysate at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant consisting of the soluble cytoplasmic fraction was saved on ice and the membrane pellet resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. UDP-MurNAc Hydroxylase Assay—UDP-MurNAc hydroxylase reactions contained UDP-MurN[14C]Ac (2 × 109 Bq/mmol) (1 nmol), β-NADPH (250 nmol) in 50 mm Tris pH 8.0 buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Mixtures were prewarmed to 37 °C, and reactions were initiated by the addition of a freshly prepared M. smegmatis whole cell extract, soluble extract, or membrane fraction (2 mg of total protein/reaction) for a final reaction volume of 300 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min at which time protein was removed from the reactions using an Amicon Centriplus YM-10 filter device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) by centrifugation at 7,500 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Following protein removal, 150 μl of each sample was added to 150 μl of 8 n HCl and hydrolyzed at 100 °C for 4 h to liberate nucleotide sugar acyl groups (acetic or glycolic acid), then the mixture was neutralized by the addition of 150 μl of 8 n NaOH. Components of the acid-hydrolyzed reaction mixtures were separated by anion exchange HPLC using a Waters 2695 separation module (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) and a Shodex KC-811 column (Waters Corp) equilibrated with 0.1% phosphoric acid. 50-μl samples were injected into the column using an isocratic flow of 0.1% phosphoric acid at 1 ml/min. Separations were performed at 60 °C for 15 min. Fractions were collected at 10-s intervals from 8 to 12.5 min post-injection based upon control separations of glycolic and acetic acid, which possessed retention times of 9.5 and 10.8 min, respectively. We routinely added unlabeled acetic acid and glycolic acid standards to the reaction mixtures prior to acid hydrolysis as internal controls. The unlabeled acids are detected by the absorbance at 210 nm. 100 μl of each fraction was added to 5 ml of Ecolite+ scintillation fluid (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for detection of the labeled acids in a Beckman LS-1801 liquid scintillation counter. Radioactive counts were tallied under the organic acid peaks and activity expressed as pmol of UDP-MurNGlyc produced/min/mg protein. Purification and Analysis of UDP-acylmuramyl Pentapeptides— Cells for muropeptide preparation were harvested from mid-exponential phase cultures (OD600 of 0.4–0.8) that were quickly chilled, the cells washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, pelleted, and frozen at -20 °C. Ten grams of cell pellet were suspended in ice-cold 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 8, and subjected to probe sonication on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g and the supernatant transferred to a new tube to which trichloroacetic acid was added at a concentration of 10%. The mixture was stirred on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 × g and 4 °C. The clear supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the trichloroacetic acid removed by three extractions with diethyl ether. The resulting solution was dried on a rotary evaporator and reconstituted in water and loaded on a Sephadex G-25 (116 × 2.5 cm) column equilibrated with 75 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5). The column was calibrated with authentic UDP-acylmuramyl pentapeptide prepared using recombinant E. coli enzymes (4Yagi T. Mahapatra S. Mikusova K. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fractions containing UDP-acylmuramyl pentapeptide were pooled and lyophilized to remove ammonium acetate. These partially purified nucleotide-linked precursors were resuspended in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid and incubated at 60 °C for 1 h to remove the UDP moiety. The resulting muropeptides were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex peptide 10/300 GL column, equilibrated and eluted with 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot of the muropeptide-containing fraction was applied to a Hypersil ODS C18 column connected to an 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies. Palo Alto, CA). The eluent was directly introduced into a LCQ Duo electrospray mass spectrometer (Finnigan-Theromquest, San Jose, CA), and the muropeptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Acylated muramic acid was analyzed by GC-MS after treatment of purified muropeptides with mutanolysin to remove the peptides from the muramic acid. The reactions were deproteinated by ethanol precipitation and the supernatant dried under vacuum. The samples were resuspended in 3 n methanolic-HCl, heated to 80 °C for 1 h, cooled to room temperature, dried under a stream of N2, and Tri-Sil reagent was added. The mixtures were heated at 70 °C for 20 min., cooled to room temperature and the reagent evaporated under a stream of N2. The derivatized products were dissolved in a small volume of hexane and analyzed in a ThermoQuest Trace GC 2000 gas chromatograph linked to a Finnigan Polaris mass detector. M. smegmatis Antibiotic and Lysozyme Susceptibility Assays—Determination of antibiotic susceptibility was done by disk diffusion assays, while lysozyme susceptibilities were assayed by minimal inhibitory concentration tests using the macrodilution method as previously described (18Flores A.R. Parsons L.M. Pavelka Jr., M.S. Microbiology. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of lysozyme were noted as the lowest concentration at which no microbial growth could be observed or a noticeable growth defect (granular clumping) had occurred. M. smegmatis Lysozyme Growth Curves—M. smegmatis strains were grown to saturation in 7H9 broth and then diluted 10-fold into fresh 7H9 medium and incubated at 37 °C. Optical density readings were recorded at 30-min intervals. Upon reaching an OD600 of ∼0.4, the cultures were split into two, and freshly prepared lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml to one of each of the split cultures of each strain. Readings were continued at 30-min intervals until each culture reached an OD600 of ∼1.0. Development of the UDP-MurNAc Hydroxylase Assay—UDP-MurNAc hydroxylase activity was first described in the actinobacterial species N. asteroides nearly 30 years ago using an assay that monitored the NADPH-dependent conversion of radiolabeled UDP-MurNAc to UDP-MurNGlyc (15Gateau O. Bordet C. Michel G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 421: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The substrate and product were detected using paper chromatography with comparison to chemically synthesized standards. Unfortunately, this assay was difficult for us to reproduce without UDP-MurNAc and UDP-MurNGlyc for comparison, as neither of these compounds is commercially available. Therefore, we decided to develop a new, HPLC-based assay, for the detection of the mycobacterial UDP-MurNAc hydroxylase activity, using UDP-MurNAc synthesized in our laboratory from commercially available UDP-GlcNAc. Our initial attempts to assay the hydroxylase using UDP-MurNAc or radiolabeled UDP-MurNAc synthesized from UDP-GlcNAc in which the hexosamine backbone was 14C-labeled, were unsuccessful (data not shown). In each case, we were not able to unambiguously determine if UDP-MurNGlyc was produced in our assays, as we had no authentic UDP-MurNGlyc available for comparison. To overcome this problem, we used UDP-MurNAc in which the acetyl group of the nucleotide sugar was 14C-labeled in order to facilitate the identification of UDP-MurNGlyc (“Experimental Procedures”). The detection method is based upon the observation that acid hydrolysis of N-acylated hexosamine sugars liberates the acyl group as a free acid. Therefore, acid hydrolysis of the hydroxylase assay reaction mixtures would release the labeled acyl groups of UDP-MurNAc and UDP-MurNGlyc as [14C]acetic acid and [14C]glycolic acid, respectively. These acids are easily distinguished from each other by their separation profiles in anion exchange HPLC. A schematic representation of our mycobacterial UDP-MurNAc hydroxylase assay is shown in Fig. 1. Completed reaction mixtures were clarified using an Amicon filtration device, and then subjected to acid hydrolysis. The components of the hydrolysate were separated by anion exchange HPLC for 15 min, and the fractions containing the 14C organic acids were detected by scintillation counting. The radioactive peaks were compared with our established retention times for unlabeled glycolic acid (9.5 min) and unlabeled acetic acid (10.8 min) standards. Because the acid hydrolysis is essentially 100% efficient in the removal of acyl groups from nucleotide sugars (data not shown) the amount of [14C]glycolic acid detected after acid hydrolysis of the reaction components corresponds to the amount of UDP-MurNGlyc produced. The UDP-MurNAc hydroxylase activity in reactions containing 2 mg of protein of a whole cell extract of wild-type M. smegmatis strain PM965 was 23 pmol of UDP-MurNGlyc/min/mg protein (Table I). The activity was present in a soluble fraction prepared from the cell extract but was not present in the membrane fraction (Table I). The addition of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled UDP-MurNAc to reactions with whole cell extracts decreased the amount of labeled product by a factor of ten, However, the same result was not seen when a 10-fold excess of unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc was added to the reactions (Table I).Table IMeasurement of M. smegmatis UDP-MurNAc hydroxylase activity Enzymatic activity was determined from various fractions of a M. smegmatis cell lysate and is expressed as the pmol of UDP-MurNGlyc produced/min/mg of protein.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar) alignment of the M. smegmatis UDP-MurNAc hydroxylase protein sequence with several eukaryotic CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylases and the homologs present in the genomes of N. farcinica and Rhodococcus sp. RHA1. To aid in sequence alignment only residues present within the protein cores were used in the ClustalW analysis. We omitted the N and C termini of the eukaryotic hydroxylases and C termini of the bacterial enzymes for the sake of clarity (see below). We found that the prokaryotic proteins are only 12% identical to the eukaryotic hydroxylases, although when strongly conserved residues are considered the similarity increases to 28%. A conserved iron binding domain, presumably required for the metal-dependent acquisition of oxygen (13Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 27Schlenzka W. Shaw L. Kelm S. Schmidt C.L. Bill E. Trautwein A.X. Lottspeich F. Schauer R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), is present in both the eukaryotic enzymes and the bacterial protein sequences (Fig. 2A). Also, a Rieske iron-sulfur domain found in the N termini of the eukaryotic enzymes and involved with electron transfer (13Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 27Schlenzka W. Shaw L. Kelm S. Schmidt C.L. Bill E. Trautwein A.X. Lottspeich F. Schauer R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), is located within the C termini of the bacterial proteins. The differential location of these [Fe-S] domains among the various proteins prompted us to remove the N and C termini of the proteins in the alignment in Fig. 2A (see Fig. 2B, for the Rieske [Fe-S] domain of the M. smegmatis protein, as an example). Based upon these sequence analyses we believe the prokaryotic proteins described here, represented by M. tuberculosis open reading frame Rv3818 and the homologous open reading frame present within M. smegmatis are the bacterial UDP-MurNAc hydroxylases. We propose to name the corresponding gene namH. The namH Gene Is Not Essential to M. smegmati"

Several transporters have been implicated in the zinc entry into secretory compartments from cytosol, but their precise roles are poorly understood. We report here that two zinc transporters (ZnT5 and ZnT7) localized in the secretory apparatus are responsible for loading zinc to alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) that are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins exposed to the extracellular site. Disruption of the ZnT5 gene in DT40 cells decreased the ALP activity to 45% of that in the wild-type cells. Disruption of the ZnT7 gene lowered the ALP activity only by 20%. Disruption of both genes markedly decreased the ALP activity to <5%. Overexpression of human ZnT5 or ZnT7 in DT40 cells deficient in both ZnT5 and ZnT7 genes recovered the ALP activity to the level comparable to that in the wild-type cells. The inactive ALP protein in DT40 cells deficient in both ZnT5 and ZnT7 genes was transported to cytoplasmic membrane like the active ALP protein in the wild-type cells. Thus both ZnT5 and ZnT7 contribute to the conversion of apo-ALP to holo-ALP. Numerous proteins are properly folded by binding with zinc during their itinerary in the biosynthetic-secretory pathway.

Thus both ZnT5 and ZnT7 contribute to the conversion of apo-ALP to holo-ALP. Zinc is an essential trace element required as a structural component of a large number of proteins such as metalloenzymes and transcription factors (1Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Because zinc can not freely pass the membrane of cells and intracellular organelles, zinc transporter proteins have been thought to play a critical role in regulating the zinc concentration in the cytosol and lumen of organelles. Recently, a number of zinc transporters have been cloned in vertebrates (3Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 4Chimienti F. Aouffen M.

Based on their sequence homology, and structural and functional properties, they have been assigned to two metal-transporter families: ZIP 1The abbreviations used are: ZIP, ZRT/IRT-related protein; ZnT, zinc transporter; CDF, cation diffusion facilitator; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; TNAP, tissue nonspecific ALP; PLAP, placenta ALP; IAP, intestinal ALP; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; GPI-PET, GPI-phosphoethanolamine transferase. (ZRT/IRT-related protein) family and CDF (cation diffusion facilitator) family (3Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 4Chimienti F.

ZIP family transporters function in zinc influx into cytosol from extracellular sites and the lumen of intracellular organelles. CDF family transporters facilitate zinc efflux from cytosol and mobilize the cytosolic zinc into intracellular organelles. This mobilization of zinc into organelles may supply zinc to zinc-dependent proteins in situ and may also contribute to zinc storage and/or detoxification. To date, eight CDF members, named ZnT1-8 (zinc transporter 1-8), have been characterized in mammals (4Chimienti F. Aouffen M. Favier A. Seve M. Curr. Drug. Targets. 2003; 4: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Nagao M. Cell Mol.

Of these mammalian CDF members, ZnT5-7 are located in the Golgi apparatus and implicated in the entry of zinc into the Golgi lumen (10Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T.

ZnT5-7, if not all, may be responsible for loading zinc to secretory, membrane-bound, or organelle-resident proteins that require zinc for manifestation of their biological activities, but evidence supporting this assumption has been lacking. There are a number of secretory or membrane-bound enzymes that require zinc as an essential component; e.g. matrix metalloproteinases (13Overall C.M. Lopez-Otin C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 657-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), angiotensin-converting enzyme (14Natesh R. Schwager S.L. Sturrock E.D. Acharya K.R. Nature. 2003; 421: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), carboxypeptidases (15Kilshtain-Vardi A. Glick M. Greenblatt H.M. Goldblum A. Shoham G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) (16Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Menez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9158-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). ALPs are a group of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins exposed to the extracellular site (17Millan J.L. Fishman W.H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In mammals, four types of ALPs, tissue-nonspecific ALP (TNAP), placental ALP (PLAP), intestinal ALP (IAP) and germ cell ALP, have been identified. They contain two tightly bound zinc ions per polypeptide in their active site (17Millan J.L. Fishman W.H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the binding of zinc likely occurs in the biosynthetic-secretory pathway before reaching their final destination. Dimerization yields the active enzyme (18Le Du M.H. Millan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49808-49814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). DT40 is a chicken B lymphocyte-derived cell line with a unique property that the homologous recombination activity is high, and thereby genes of interest can be disrupted at a high frequency (19Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 20Winding P. Berchtold M.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 249: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as described later, it contains counterparts of mammalian ZnT1-7 genes, and most of their mRNAs are expressed. DT40 cells also express TNAP at the extracellular site of their cytoplasmic membrane. Using DT40 cells and ALPs, here we describe the first evidence that both ZnT5 and ZnT7 are required for loading zinc to ALPs in the biosynthetic-secretory pathway. Cell Culture and Transfection—Fetal calf serum (FCS, Trace Scientific Ltd.) was heat-inactivated. HeLa and HEp2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C. DT40 cells (gift from Dr. Shunichi Takeda) were maintained in RPMI1640 (Nacalai) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% chicken serum (JRH), and 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) at 39.5 °C. Zinc-free serum was made according to the instruction manual by treating 50 ml of serum (mixture of FCS and chicken serum in 10:1 by volume ratio) with Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad). The resin was removed by filtration of the Chelex-treated serum. DNA transfection into DT40 cells was carried out according to the methods described elsewhere (21Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 30 μg of linearized plasmid DNA. DNA was electroporated into the cells with a GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 550 V and 25 microfarads. After electroporation, cells were transferred into 20 ml of fresh medium and incubated for 24 h. Then, cells were resuspended into 80 ml of fresh medium containing appropriate drugs and divided into four 96-well plates. After 7 days, drug-resistant clones were transferred to 24-well plates and cultured for 2 days. Then the clones were transferred to 100-mm dishes (10-ml cultures). After culture for 2 days, genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed by Southern blotting. The concentrations of drugs used for screening were 30 μg/ml for Blasticidin-S (Calbiochem), 2 mg/ml for G418 (Nacalai), 0.5 μg/ml for puromycin (Sigma), 1 mg/ml for l-histidinol (Sigma), and 0.3-1 mg/ml for Zeocin (Invitrogen). Over five independent clones per transfectant were established. Plasmids Construction—The ∼9-kb chicken ZnT5 (cZnT5) or ∼11-kb cZnT7 gene was amplified with a pair of gene-specific primers using DT40 genomic DNA as a template by LA Taq (TAKARA). Each amplified DNA fragment was used to map the restriction sites. The long or short arm was PCR-amplified and subcloned upstream or downstream of the drug-resistant genes (Bsrr, Hisr, and Neor) under the control of β-actin promoter (drug selection marker cassettes, gift from Dr. Shunichi Takeda). Plasmids to express human ZnT5 (hZnT5), cZnT5, or hZnT7 were constructed by inserting each cDNA into the pA-Puro vector (22Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The PLAP cDNA was made by ligating the fragment of secreted alkaline phosphatase gene prepared from pSEAP2-Basic vector (Clontech) with the fragment of RT-PCR-amplified PLAP cDNA encoding C-terminal region of PLAP. The PLAP cDNA was inserted into a pA-Zeocin vector to construct PLAP expression plasmid. The pA-Zeocin vector was constructed by replacing the Puror gene in the pA-Puro vector with the Zeor gene. All plasmids were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes prior to electroporation. RT-PCR Analysis for Detection of mRNA of ZnT Members in DT40 Cells—Messenger RNAs of ZnT members were examined by RT-PCR using total RNA prepared from DT40 cells as a template. The specific primers designed from the chicken expressed sequence tag sequences were: 5′-CGCTGGGCATTATCCTCTGGATGTTGAAGA-3′ and 5′-GGTTTTCTGAAGTTGTTACAGCATCGGTGC-3′ for cZnT1, 5′-TCTATGTGGCTGCTGGCATCTGCCTCATCT-3′ and 5′-AGAAGAGGAAGGTGCAGATGGGGTCCACAT-3′ for cZnT2, 5′-GGCCGTCAGCCTCTTCTCGCTCTGGGTGTC-3′ and 5′-CCGCCTCCACGTACCGCTCCACCTGCACTG-3′ for cZnT3, 5′-GCCGCCGCCGTCCTCTATCTGCTCTTCATG-3′ and 5′-GGCACTGGAACTCTGACAACTTGCGCAGGC-3′ for cZnT4,5′-ATGGAGTATGGACCAATAGCCTTGGTCTTA-3′ and 5′-AGCATGCAGATCTTTCTCCTGTTCGTGAGG-3′ for cZnT5, 5′-ATATGTATTGGCTTCCTGCTAATGTGGTGC-3′ and 5′-CGGACATGGACCGATCCAGCCAAAGTGCCA-3′ for cZnT6, and 5′-GACTCTACTGCTCTATTGGCTGGATTAGCAGCTT-3′ and 5′-TACATGGCTGCAACATCAATTTGTATGTAAAGCT-3′ for cZnT7. The products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization Analysis—Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis was performed as described previously (23Okumura K. Nogami M. Matsushima Y. Matsumura K. Nakamura K. Taguchi H. Kitagawa Y. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1640-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, chromosome spreads were generated from DT40 cells after thymidine synchronization and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. The cZnT5 or cZnT7 genomic DNA was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Applied Science) by nick translation and used as a probe. After in situ hybridization, the hybridized probe was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (Roche Applied Science). Southern Blotting—Twenty micrograms of genomic DNA prepared from DT40 cells were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes (shown in Fig. 2) for 24 h. After digestion, DNA was electrophoresed on agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane filter in 0.4 n NaOH. The membrane was hybridized to the radiolabeled DNA probes (shown in Fig. 2) and exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji). Radioimages were obtained using a BAS 2000 Bio imaging analyzer (Fuji). RNA Preparation and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from DT40 cells using Sepasol I (Nacalai). The RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed on agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane filter in 20× SSC buffer. The membrane was hybridized to the appropriately radiolabeled cDNA probes. Radioimages were obtained as described above. Preparation of Membrane Fraction—DT40 cells (∼2 × 107) were collected and washed with PBS. These cells were resuspended in 2 ml of cold homogenizing buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EDTA) and homogenized with 20 strokes of a 7-ml Dounce homogenizer. ALPs firmly bind with zinc, and therefore the presence of 1 mm EDTA in the homogenizing buffer does not affect the enzyme activity. To remove the nucleus, the homogenate was centrifuged at 2,200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet, which contained cytoplasmic and organelle membranes, was lysed in ALP lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and stocked at -70 °C until use. For fractionation of the organelles, the membrane was centrifuged on a 0.7-1.7 m sucrose gradient as described previously (10Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19049-19055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and separated into 10 fractions. The concentration of protein was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard Immunoblot Analysis—Membrane proteins were mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer and then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, or total cellular proteins were lysed in the same buffer and then boiled at 100 °C for 5 min before electrophoresis. Proteins were separated with electrophoresis through 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer of proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences), the blot was blocked with blocking solution (5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) and then incubated with anti-ZnT5 (1:2000 dilution), anti-GM130 (BD Transduction Laboratories; 1:250 dilution), anti-SEC23 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100 dilution), anti-EEA1 (BD Transduction Laboratories; 1:1000 dilution), anti-γ1-adaptin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100 dilution), anti-calreticulin (Affinity Bioreagents; 1:1000 dilution), anti-PLAP (GenHunter; 1:2000 dilution), or anti-calnexin (Stressgen; 1:1000 dilution) antibody in blocking solution. Horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a 1:3000 dilution, and Super Signal Chemiluminescent Substrate (PIERCE) was used for the detection. The intensity of bands was measured using the Image Gauge (Fuji). Immunofluorescence Staining—Immunofluorescence for ZnT5 was performed as described previously (10Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19049-19055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa or HEp2 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or methanol at -20 °C. The cells were incubated with anti-ZnT5 antibody followed by goat anti-mouse IgG and donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 or 594 (Molecular Probe). Immunofluorescence for PLAP in DT40 cells was performed using the same procedures as for ZnT5 except for the fixation step. DT40 cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and incubated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine for 30 min following the fixation with methanol at -20 °C for 20 min. The anti-PLAP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a dilution of 1:100. The stained cells were observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus). Measurement of ALP Activity—The membrane protein (1 μg) or total cellular protein (10 μg) lysed in ALP lysis buffer was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature. A 100-μl substrate solution (2 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1 m diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8, containing 0.5 mm MgCl2) was added. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, p-nitrophenol released by TNAP was measured by the absorbance at 405 nm. For measurement of PLAP activity, samples were kept at 65 °C for 30 min to inactivate TNAP. Shrimp ALP (Roche Applied Science) was used as a standard. PI-PLC Digestion and Immunoprecipitation—DT40 cells (2 × 106) expressing PLAP were incubated in culture medium for 3 h and collected. These cells were washed with PBS and incubated with or without 0.2 unit of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Molecular Probes) in 0.5 ml of PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PLAP antibody conjugated to agarose (Sigma) to concentrate PLAP detached from cell surface by PI-PLC digestion. The PLAP-complex beads were treated with 6× SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min, electrophoresed as described above, and immunoblotted. Subcellular Localization of ZnT5 in HeLa and HEp2—We previously identified ZnT5 as a zinc transporter that was abundantly expressed in pancreatic β cells and was associated with insulin granules in the cells, which suggested that ZnT5 transports zinc into insulin granules to form an insulin hexamer containing two zinc ions (10Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19049-19055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA of ZnT5, however, was detected ubiquitously (10Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Favier A. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), indicating that ZnT5 possesses other functions. When ZnT5 was overexpressed, its localization overlapped with that of the Golgi marker protein, GM130 (10Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19049-19055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), or Golgi 58K protein (24Inoue K. Matsuda K. Itoh M. Kawaguchi H. Tomoike H. Aoyagi T. Nagai R. Hori M. Nakamura Y. Tanaka T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because localization of the endogenous ZnT5 remains to be determined, we immunostained the cells using antibodies against hZnT5 and various marker proteins of organelles. As shown in Fig. 1A, ZnT5 was found in the cytoplasmic vesicles and perinuclear portion in HeLa and HEp2 cells. The immunostaining against marker proteins, however, failed to reveal the specific marker that was completely superimposed with ZnT5 (data not shown). Then, we fractionated HeLa-derived organelles by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and the distribution of ZnT5 was compared with that of various organelle markers. Fig. 1B shows the immunoblot of proteins in the fractionated organelles. ZnT5 was mainly detected in fractions 5 and 6, which was similar to Sec23, a marker protein of COPII vesicles that bud from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and carry cargo to the cis-Golgi, and GM130, a marker of Golgi apparatus. Distribution of ZnT5 differed from that of EEA1 (endosomes), γ1-adaptin (AP-1 vesicles), and calreticulin (ER). AP-1 vesicles bud from the trans side of the Golgi apparatus, which faces cytoplasmic membrane where secretion occurs. The antibody against γ1-adaptin used here recognizes two types of γ1-adaptin with different sizes. Because ER produces vesicles with various densities during preparation, its marker protein (calreticulin) was detected in most fractions. The same results were obtained when another marker, calnexin, was used (data not shown). These results indicate that the endogenous ZnT5 is concentrated in early compartments of the secretory pathway such as COPII-coated vesicles and Golgi apparatus. Expression of ZnT Members in DT40 Cells—To find whether the chicken-derived DT40 cell line expresses the orthologues of mammalian CDF family members, we examined their mRNA expression in DT40 cells. Comparison of the chicken expressed sequence tag sequences with mammalian ZnT1-8 revealed nucleotide fragments homologous to ZnT1-7 but not to ZnT8 (Table I). Detection of mRNA in DT40 cells by RT-PCR confirmed expression of cZnT1-7 except for cZnT3 (Table I), indicating that DT40 is suitable for studying ZnT members.Table ICDF family members in DT40 cellsGeneChicken ESTsExpression in DT40 cellscZnT1+a+, -, D, UD, and NE indicate presence, absence, detectable, undetectable, and not examined, respectively.DcZnT2+DcZnT3+UDcZnT4+DcZnT5+DcZnT6+DcZnT7+DcZnT8-NEa +, -, D, UD, and NE indicate presence, absence, detectable, undetectable, and not examined, respectively. Open table in a new tab Generation of DT40 Cells Deficient in ZnT5—To investigate the cellular function of ZnT5, we generated ZnT5-deficient DT40 cells. Because fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the cZnT5 gene resides in a monosome (data not shown), ZnT5-deficient DT40 cells are referred to as ZnT5- cells. Fig. 2A shows the strategy for disruption of ZnT5 gene and data to confirm its absence in ZnT5- cells. As described later, we examined DT40 cells deficient in ZnT5 and/or ZnT7 genes, and therefore the strategy for disruption of cZnT7 gene, including data confirming its absence, is also shown in Fig. 2B. Chicken ZnT7 resides in the somatic chromosome (data not shown). Disruption of cZnT5 or cZnT7 did not give apparent detrimental effects; ZnT5- and ZnT7-/- cells proliferate at a rate comparable to that of the wild-type cells, and there is no difference between mutant and wild-type cells in the sensitivity to zinc toxicity. Messenger RNA of cZnT5 encodes a 770-amino acid protein with 88% identity to hZnT5, whereas that of cZnT7 encodes a 378-amino acid protein with 83% identity to hZnT7 (see accession number AY703476 for cZnT5 cDNA and AY703477 for cZnT7 cDNA). Four distinct genes encoding ALP have been identified in mammals, whereas two of these forms, IAP and TNAP, have been reported in birds (26Crawford K. Weissig H. Binette F. Millan J.L. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In DT40 cells, the TNAP mRNA alone was detected by RT-PCR and ALP activity in DT40 cells was completely inhibited by levamisole, a specific inhibitor of TNAP, which indicated that DT40 cells exclusively express TNAP of ALPs. TNAP activity was assayed by the use of membrane in the post-nuclear fraction. TNAP activity was severely reduced in the wild-type DT40 cultured for 18 h in the zinc-free medium containing Chelex-treated FCS, and the activity was fully restored when zinc was supplemented to the zinc-free medium (Fig. 3A, upper panel). There was no change in TNAP mRNA content at any zinc concentrations tested (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Little activity of TNAP was detected in the membrane prepared from the cells cultured in the zinc-free medium and washed with zinc-containing buffer. This result excludes the possibility that zinc-deprived TNAP of the cells cultured in the zinc-free medium quickly recovers its activity by re-binding with zinc in the washing buffer. Thus TNAP activity is a good reporter of zinc metabolism in the biosynthetic-secretory pathway in DT40 cells. Next, we examined the TNAP activity of ZnT5- cells in comparison with that of wild-type cells. TNAP activity in ZnT5- cells was reduced to about 45% of that in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B, upper panel) despite no significant difference in expression of TNAP mRNA (Fig. 3B, lower panel). This reduction was restored by expressing the exogenous ZnT5 cDNA from either chicken or human (about 80% or 90% activity compared with that of wild-type cells) (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Overexpression of hZnT5 in the wild-type DT40 did not increase TNAP activity (Fig. 3B, upper panel), indicating that zinc influx to secretory compartments by endogenous transporters is sufficient for the full expression of TNAP activity. The overexpressed hZnT5 in DT40 cells was localized mainly in secretory compartments such as Golgi apparatus with immunofluorescence staining of the cells or immunoblotting after fractionation of organelles by sucrose gradient centrifugation (data not shown). Similar localization in DT40 cells was found for hZnT7 tagged with FLAG epitope (data not shown). ZnT5 and ZnT7 Are Required for the Full Activation of TNAP—Disruption of ZnT5 gene reduced TNAP activity, but 45% of the activity remained, suggesting that other transporters may also be involved in expression of TNAP activity. Kirschke and Huang (12Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4096-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) previously reported that ZnT7 residing in Golgi apparatus may transport zinc into the Golgi lumen, because overexpression of ZnT7 in CHO cells accumulates zinc in Golgi apparatus in a high zinc condition. To examine contribution of ZnT7 to TNAP activity in DT40 cells, we generated ZnT7-deficient DT40 cells (ZnT7-/- cells) (Fig. 2B) and compared their phenotypes with those of ZnT5- cells and wild-type cells. ZnT7-/- cells showed lower TNAP activity than wild-type cells (80% of the wild-type), but this reduction was smaller than that found in ZnT5- cells (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Thus contribution of ZnT7 to TNAP activity appears to be minor. TNAP activity was severely decreased in DT40 cells deficient in both ZnT5 and ZnT7 (ZnT5-ZnT7-/- cells) (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The TNAP activity in ZnT5-ZnT7-/- cells was restored to 75 and 85% of that in the wild-type cells by expression of human ZnT5 and ZnT7, respectively. In all cases, the level of TNAP mRNA was unchanged (Fig. 4A, lower panel). ZnT5-ZnT7-/- cells showed slightly slow growth; doubling time for ZnT5-ZnT7-/- cells was 9.5 h, while that for wild-type cells was 7.3 h. Microscopic morphology of ZnT5-ZnT7-/- cells was normal and the sensitivity to a high zinc concentration was similar to that of the wild-type cells. Like the wild-type DT40 cells (see Fig. 3A, upper panel), the TNAP activity in ZnT5-ZnT7-/- cells restored by expressing hZnT5 or hZnT7 disappeared when cultured in the zinc-free medium, but the addition of zinc to the medium maintained the activity (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Levels of mRNAs for hZnT5 and hZnT7 expressed in ZnT5-ZnT7-/- cells were unchanged under the culture conditions tested (Fig. 4B, lower panel). The addition of cobalt or manganese to the zinc-free medium had no effects (data not shown). We conclude from these results that both ZnT5 and ZnT7 are required for expression of the full TNAP activity. ZnT5 and ZnT7 Contribute to the Conversion of Apo-ALP to Holo-ALP—Marked reduction of TNAP activity in ZnT5-ZnT7-/- cells (Fig. 4A, upper panel) raises two possibilities; TNAP protein may not be present in this mutant cell although its mRNA is present at a normal level (Fig. 4A, lower panel) or TNAP protein may be pres"

Here we describe the purification of a trans-acting factor controlling FGF-2 mRNA translation achieved by several biochemical purification approaches.

Recombinant hnRNP A1 stimulates in vitro translation at the four IRES-dependent initiation codons but has no effect on the cap-dependent initiation codon. Consistent with a role of hnRNP A1 in the control of alternative initiation of translation, short interfering RNA-mediated knock down of hnRNP A1 specifically inhibits translation at the four IRES-dependent initiation codons. Furthermore, hnRNP A1 binds to the FGF-2 IRES, implicating this interaction in the control of alternative initiation of translation.

Furthermore, hnRNP A1 binds to the FGF-2 IRES, implicating this interaction in the control of alternative initiation of translation. In eukaryotes, alternative translation initiation at several start codons is one of the processes by which a single mRNA gives rise to multiple proteins, and this contributes to the generation of protein diversity (1Touriol C. Bornes S. Bonnal S. Audigier S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Vagner S. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). According to the ribosome-scanning model of translation, protein synthesis in eukaryotes involves the 40 S ribosomal subunit recruitment to the 5′-end cap structure of the mRNA, followed by its ATP-dependent linear scanning until an initiation codon in a good sequence context is encountered (2Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). In mRNAs containing several alternative translation initiation codons, it is proposed that the cap-proximal initiation codon is used inefficiently because of its usual weak sequence context and that some of the 40 S ribosomal subunits read through the site without recognizing it by a so-called “leaky scanning” process to initiate translation at the downstream position (3Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2662-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism cannot occur when the RNA structure between the two (or more) initiation codons is stable and cannot be easily unwound by the eIF4A RNA helicase. Moreover, recent data demonstrate that 40% of mRNAs contain at least one upstream AUG that is in a similar or more favorable context than the actual initiator (4Peri S. Pandey A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 685-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, the leaky scanning mechanism cannot explain the selection of internal codons in all mRNAs. The human FGF-2 1The abbreviations used are: FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor 2; hnRNP A1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; siRNA, short interfering RNAs; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; nts, nucleotides; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ORF, open reading frame; UTR, untranslated region; RNAi, RNA interference; WT, wild type; MUT, mutant; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; EMCV, encephalomyocarditis virus; ITAF, IRES trans-acting factor; PTB, polypyrimidine tract binding protein. mRNA provides a very interesting system to understand how internal codons are selected in a highly structured 5′-leader. Indeed, the control of alternative initiation of translation is a crucial aspect of the regulation of the human fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) gene (1Touriol C. Bornes S. Bonnal S. Audigier S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Vagner S. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The FGF-2 protein isoforms belong to a family of 23 structurally related FGF polypeptides that play key roles in morphogenesis, development, angiogenesis, and wound healing (5Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The FGF-2 mRNA contains five in-frame translation initiation codons (4 CUGs and 1 AUG) that give rise to five FGF-2 isoforms with different amino-terminal extensions. Regulation of the expression of these isoforms could have a strong impact on cell behavior, because the various FGF-2 isoforms have different subcellular localizations and functions. The largest isoform (34 kDa) is initiated at a CUG codon located 86 nucleotides (nts) from the mRNA 5′-end. This isoform is nuclear and is involved in a cell survival function. The 24-, 22.5-, and 22-kDa isoforms are initiated at three CUG codons located 320, 347, and 362 nts from the 5′-end. These isoforms have a nuclear localization and are involved in cell immortalization. Translation initiation of the 18-kDa FGF-2 isoform occurs at an AUG codon located 485 nucleotides from the 5′-end. Constitutive expression of this secreted low molecular weight FGF-2 isoform leads to cell transformation. Alternative expression of the FGF-2 isoforms is translationally regulated depending on the cell type or cell status and is controlled by various cis-acting elements including an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (6Prats A.C.

Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The process of internal entry of ribosomes leads to the recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to IRESs present on eukaryotic viral or cellular mRNAs (10Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It is an alternative to the mechanism of translation initiation that results from the attachment of the 40 S subunit of the ribosome to the 5′-end capped structure of mRNAs. IRESs are present in more than 30 viral mRNAs and 50 cellular mRNAs (11Bonnal S. Boutonnet C. Prado-Lourenco L. Vagner S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 427-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Internal entry of ribosomes requires the intervention of specific RNA-binding proteins, also known as ITAF (“IRES trans-acting factor”) that stimulate translation of some IRES-containing cellular mRNAs (11Bonnal S. Boutonnet C. Prado-Lourenco L. Vagner S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 427-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The FGF-2 IRES could play a critical role in the choice of alternative translation initiation codons on this mRNA. Indeed, whereas the 34-kDa isoform is initiated by a cap-dependent translation process, the other four isoforms are initiated by an internal entry of ribosome mechanism (7Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 9Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Such a situation with a 5′-end proximal cap-dependent start codon and an IRES-dependent codon was also found in the Moloney murine leukemia virus gag mRNA (12Vagner S. Waysbort A. Marenda M. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Prats A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20376-20383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the human PITSLRE protein kinases mRNA (13Cornelis S. Bruynooghe Y. Denecker G. Huffel VanS. Tinton S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which internal entry of ribosomes is favored over cap-dependent translation to select internal start codons is not known. To understand better how control of alternative initiation of translation on the FGF-2 mRNA is achieved, we used several biochemical approaches to identify a possible trans-acting factor modulating this process. Our data demonstrate that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 is a factor that binds to the FGF-2 5′-leader RNA. We also show, by using in vitro translation experiments and siRNA-dependent knock down of endogenous levels of hnRNP A1 in cultured cells, that hnRNP A1 controls alternative initiation of translation of the FGF-2 mRNA. The activity of hnRNP A1 in FGF-2 IRES-mediated translation contributes to the choice of the alternative start codons. We thus provide experimental evidence supporting the notion that selection of internal codons is not only achieved by a leaky scanning mechanism at an upstream initiation codon but by a mechanism involving a trans-acting factor controlling an IRES. DNA Manipulations—Detailed information about DNA cloning procedures can be obtained from the authors upon request. RNA Affinity Chromatography—1 nmol of in vitro transcribed RNA was incubated with 1 nmol of a (dT)25 oligonucleotide biotinylated at its 3′-end RNAs and 100 μl of packed streptavidin acrylamide resin (Pierce) in 500 μl of TMK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl) for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the nuclear extract from HeLa cells (150 μg) was loaded onto the RNA column in TMK buffer (200 μl of final volume). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with TMK buffer (1 ml). The proteins retained on the RNA column were eluted in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 95 °C for 2 min. The eluted proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained by brilliant blue G-colloidal (Sigma). Proteins were excised from the gel and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Biochemical Fractionation Procedure for HeLa Cells—The cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts for HeLa S3 cells were prepared according to Ref. 14Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar. The HeLa nuclear extract (8 ml at 20 mg/ml) was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) on a fast protein liquid chromatography system. Proteins were eluted with a linear 10-ml gradient (0.4–0.8 m NaCl). Fractions (1 ml) resulting from the heparin-Sepharose were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl), and loaded onto a Mono S cation-exchange chromatography equilibrated with buffer A on a fast protein liquid chromatography system. Proteins were eluted with a linear 20-ml gradient (0.4–0.8 m NaCl). 1-ml fractions were collected. Fraction 7 was eluted between 0.51 and 0.53 m NaCl, and fraction 9 was eluted between 0.57 and 0.59 m NaCl. All fractions were subsequently dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). hnRNP A1 Depletion from Purified Fraction 9—Fraction 9 was depleted of hnRNP A1 with a 5′-biotinylated DNA oligonucleotide (5′-CTAGTATGATAGGGACTTAGGGTG-3′) corresponding to the hnRNP A1 RNA-binding site identified by a SELEX procedure (15Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 nmol of oligonucleotide was incubated with 100 μl of packed streptavidin acrylamide resin (Pierce) in 150 μl of buffer A. After extensive washing, fraction 9 (100 μg) was incubated with the resin for 60 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 2000 rpm, the supernatant was kept. Depleted fraction 9 was checked by Western blot. A mock control column was done with a mutated DNA oligonucleotide (5′-CTAGTATGAGATGGACTGATGGTG-3′). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The three GST-tagged proteins hnRNP A1 (GST-A1), hnRNP I/PTB (GST-PTB), and La (GST-La) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity by glutathione-agarose chromatography, and dialyzed against buffer D. UV Cross-linking/Immunoprecipitation—Protein extracts (5 μg) were mixed with in vitro transcribed 32P-labeled RNAs (150,000 cpm) in buffer GS (5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 30 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 4% glycerol) for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were irradiated on ice with UV light (254 nm) in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) at 0.4 J/cm2 at 10 cm distance. 5 units of RNase ONE (Promega) were then added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. SDS gel loading buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 2 min before fractionation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. When competitions were performed, extracts were preincubated with cold competitors in GS buffer for 10 min at room temperature before addition of the probe. For immunoprecipitation of UV cross-linked proteins, the RNase ONE-treated samples were diluted in 150 μl of IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), precleared, and mixed with 1 μl of anti-hnRNP A1 monoclonal antibody (α4B10; gift from G. Dreyfuss). The mixtures were allowed to rotate 1 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A beads was added to the mixtures and incubation continued for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the beads, the bound proteins were eluted in SDS loading buffer. Gel Retardation Assay—In vitro transcribed 32P-labeled RNA (10,000 cpm) was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in 10 μl of GS buffer with 200 ng of GST-A1. After addition of 5 μl of 80% glycerol, the mixture was loaded on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel (bisacrylamide:acrylamide 1:29; 0.5× TBE), and migration was performed for 4 h at 200 V at 4 °C. The gel was then subjected to PhosphorImaging and autoradiography. For competition experiments, unlabeled in vitro transcribed RNAs were preincubated with GST-A1 in GS buffer for 15 min. Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Assays—Increasing amounts of a purified GST-A1 were added to an in vitro transcribed 32P-labeled RNA corresponding to the FGF-2 IRES-(1–177) in a total volume of 10 μl of GS binding buffer containing 400 ng of yeast tRNA. The mixture was allowed to incubate for 10 min at room temperature. 8 μl of each binding reaction was applied on a pre-soaked nitrocellulose membrane on a slot dot apparatus (hybrislot manifold, Invitrogen) under moderate suction. Each slot dot was washed with 200 μl of room temperature GS buffer, and the membranes were dried for 1 h at room temperature. The filters were exposed in a PhosphorImager cassette (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h and revealed. The quantifications were performed with the ImageQuant version 1.1 software, and the data were corrected for the background (RNA retention without any added protein) which was <2%. The fraction of RNA bound was plotted against the protein concentration. Binding curves of three independent experiments were fitted by using SigmaPlot to determine the apparent dissociation constants. In Vitro Translation—In vitro transcribed RNAs (3 μg/ml except otherwise indicated) were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). When protein fractions or recombinant proteins were added to the reaction, preincubation with RNA for 5 min at room temperature was done before the addition of RRL. The translation reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by RNase A treatment. The reaction mixture was loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography of the gel. RNA Interference (RNAi)—siRNA oligonucleotides (sequences in Fig. 7) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research. Double-stranded RNAs were transfected in HeLa cells with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Western blot analysis was performed 72 h post-transfection.Fig. 1Purification of proteins that modulate FGF-2 translation in vitro in RRL.

Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Expression of FGF-2 mRNA was determined by real time PCR with a sequence Detection System model 7700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the instruction manual. Total RNA from HeLa cells was isolated by the SV Total RNA isolation system (Promega). The sequences of primers set for the human FGF-2 are as follows: sense, 5′-TGTGTCTATCAAAGGAGTGTGTGCTA-3′, and reverse 5′-ATCCGTAACACATTTAGAAGCCAGTA-3′. Total RNA levels from each sample were normalized by the quantity of 18 S rRNA in each sample. A Purified HeLa Cell Fraction Containing hnRNP A1 Promotes FGF-2-mediated in Vitro Translation—As a biochemical approach toward the identification of proteins that would promote FGF-2-mediated translation, we took advantage of the weak translation activity of the FGF-2 RNA in an RRL (6Prats A.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Amalric F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to complement this inefficient translation with a nuclear extract from HeLa S3 cells. The choice of a nuclear extract was determined by the results showing that efficient translation driven by several cellular IRESs required a nuclear event (16Stoneley M. Subkhankulova T.

However, in our assay, addition of a HeLa nuclear extract to RRL had no effect on the translation of an FGF-2-CAT reporter mRNA that consists of the first 539 nucleotides of the FGF-2 mRNA fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) ORF (6Prats A.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Amalric F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A and data not shown). This suggested that this nuclear extract either did not contain proteins able to stimulate FGF-2 translation or contained proteins whose specific or nonspecific inhibitory action masked the effects of proteins potentially able to activate FGF-2-mediated translation. We favored the second hypothesis, and we assumed that by fractionation of the extract, we should be able to separate these antagonistic activities. We therefore fractionated the extract by heparin-Sepharose chromatography followed by cation-exchange chromatography to purify positively charged proteins (Fig. 1B). At each step of the purification procedure, fractions were tested for their ability to modulate FGF-2-mediated translation when added to RRL. Up to the cation-exchange chromatography, none of the fractions tested had an effect. Eighteen of the 20 fractions resulting from cation-exchange chromatography had no effect or a slight inhibitory effect on FGF-2 translation (see fraction 10 in Fig. 1C and data not shown). However, fractions 7 and 9 had a stimulatory effect on FGF-2 translation (Fig. 1C). Fraction 7 activated translation at all five FGF-2 initiation codons, whereas fraction 9 activated FGF-2 translation at the CUG1, CUG2, CUG3, and AUG initiation codons but inhibited translation at the CUG0 (Fig. 1C). The second band migrating slightly faster than the CUG0 band results from an initiation at an ACG codon located 122 nts from the 5′-end. This initiation only occurs in RRL but does not occur in transfected cells (9Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As a specificity control, we tested the effect of these two fractions on translation of a CAT reporter RNA containing the EMCV 5′-UTR instead of the FGF-2 5′-leader. Whereas fraction 7 stimulated EMCV translation, fraction 9 had no effect (Fig. 1D). We concluded that the stimulatory effect of fraction 9 on translation initiation at the CUG1, CUG2, CUG3, and AUG initiation codons is specific. Moreover, fraction 9 was able to exert the effect we expected in controlling alternative initiation of translation on the FGF-2 mRNA. It was therefore of interest to find out which RNA-binding protein(s) present in fraction 9 exerted this effect. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining analysis revealed that this fraction, although still containing numerous proteins, was enriched in specific proteins (Fig. 1E). An ultraviolet cross-linking assay was employed to detect specific ribonucleoprotein complexes that could form between the FGF-2 5′-leader and proteins present in fraction 9. A 32P-labeled FGF-2 5′-leader RNA (nts 1–539) was incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts or fractions 7–10, irradiated with ultraviolet light, and digested with RNase. In fraction 9, several proteins of 90, 66, 48, and 34 kDa were cross-linked to the FGF-2 RNA (Fig. 1F). Identification of trans-Acting Factors Bound to the FGF-2 5′-Leader RNA—Because the amount of material present in fraction 9 was not compatible with protein identification by mass spectrometry following an RNA affinity chromatography procedure, we performed this experiment with a total nuclear extract. Two in vitro transcribed RNAs containing a 3′-terminal poly(A) tail were bound to a streptavidin acrylamide column through a biotinylated poly(dT) oligonucleotide (Fig. 2A). This strategy was used to avoid the possible steric hindrance of biotinylated groups in the RNA when biotinylation is performed during in vitro transcription. The FGF-2 5′-leader sequence (from nucleotides 1 to 539) was chosen as an affinity reagent to purify FGF-2 RNA-binding proteins, because it is sufficient to mediate FGF-2 translational control (8Vagner S.

An RNA corresponding to the EMCV IRES was also used to set up the proper chromatographic conditions to purify the known EMCV ITAFs, hnRNP I (PTB), and ITAF45 (21Hellen C.U. Witherell G.W. Schmid M.

We subjected HeLa S3 cell nuclear extracts to the various RNA columns, and after extensive washing, the retained proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Colloidal blue staining of the gel revealed that several proteins were specifically retained by each RNA (Fig. 2B). The protein bands that appeared selectively purified on the EMCV RNA or FGF-2 RNA columns were excised from the gel and subjected to trypsin digestion with subsequent microsequencing of at least two tryptic peptides. From that analysis, we identified several ribosomal proteins and RNA-binding proteins. The 57- and 45-kDa proteins purified on the EMCV RNA column were identified as two known ITAFs, hnRNP I (PTB), and ITAF45 (Fig. 2B and Table I), revealing that our purification procedure allowed the proper identification of ITAFs. The 64- and 30-kDa proteins retained on the EMCV RNA column corresponded to the hnRNP K and hnRNP E1 proteins. These two proteins have never been described as EMCV IRES trans-acting factors but are involved in translation control of the lipoxygenase mRNA (23Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Shatsky I.N.

https://openalex.org/W2008513611,"Heat shock proteins (hsps) are involved in multiple cellular processes during normal and stress conditions, particularly in the folding of polypeptides. A newly recognized property of the members of the Hsp70 family is their ability to interact with lipids, opening ion conductance pathways in artificial membranes, and integrating into natural membranes. The formation of Hsp70 channels in biological membranes and their function is still elusive. In this study, we showed that Hsp70 and Hsc70 display a highly selective interaction with phosphatidylserine moieties on membranes, followed by rapid incorporation into the lipid bilayer. Addition of Hsp70 or Hsc70 into the extracellular medium resulted in a viability decrease of cells beading PS on the exterior surface, such as PC12 cells. This toxic effect is modulated by the presence of ATP or ADP and can be blocked by screening PS moieties with annexin 5. These observations suggest that the presence of Hsp70 in the extracellular medium may be an accelerator of apoptosis since the presence of PS on the surface is an early indicator of this process. These findings may also explain the toxicity observed in cells overexpressing Hsp70s and provide a rational for the tight regulation of Hsp70 expression."

Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs containing the isdG coding sequence for expression of wild-type IsdG (pET15BisdG) were described previously (5Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 436-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of IsdG for Biochemical Analysis— E. coli BL21(DE3) strains carrying pET15BisdG were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicilin. The cells were subcultured into fresh medium and grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase. At this time, the expression of the vectors was induced using 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell growth was continued for 3 h at 30 °C, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min). The cells were lysed at 14,000 p.s.i. using a French press after suspension in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. After centrifugation, the soluble supernatant was applied to the Ni-NTA column, equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 20 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl followed by a second washing with 30 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 10% glycerol and 10 mm imidazole. The protein was then eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 500 mm imidazole, and the fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The purified proteins were stored at -20 °C. The protein yields were similar to those described previously for IsdG and IsdI (5). Generation of Mutant IsdG Proteins—IsdG proteins containing amino acid substitutions were created using the Pfu mutagenesis technique (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, complimentary oligonucleotides containing the desired alanine mutation were synthesized (IDT Technologies, Coralville, IA; oligonucleotide sequence available upon request) and used in polymerase chain reactions with pET15BisdG as template. PCR conditions followed recommendations by the manufacturer (Stratagene) including 1× reaction buffer, 10 ng of template DNA, 22 nm oligonucleotide primers, 200 μm equivalently mixed dNTPs, and water to a final volume of 50 μl. The cycling parameters included 16 cycles comprised of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C. Following PCR, 1 μl of the restriction enzyme DpnI was added directly to each amplification reaction to digest methylated DNA, and the reactions were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following digestion, DNA was transformed into DH5α, and successful transformants were selected on ampicillin agar. Successful incorporation of single amino acid changes were verified by DNA sequencing, and mutant proteins were purified as described above. Hemin Degradation Assay—All of the absorption spectra were obtained using a Cary 50BIO (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA). Ascorbic acid-dependent degradation of hemin was monitored spectrophotometrically as previously described (7Zhu W. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6783-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) with the listed changes. IsdG-hemin (10 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was incubated at 37 °C with ascorbic acid at a final concentration of 10 mm. The spectral changes between 300 and 800 nm were recorded every 2 min for the duration of the experiment. Coordinates—The coordinates and the structures factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1SQE and 1XBW). Crystal Structure of IsdG and IsdI—The high resolution crystal structures of S. aureus IsdG and IsdI in their native forms were determined at 1.9 and 1.5 Å resolution, respectively (Tables I, II, III, IV). Crystallographic phases were determined by MAD from selenomethionine-containing enzymes. IsdG and IsdI crystallized as homodimers in the monoclinic space group but in two different crystal packing environments: IsdI with one dimer in asymmetric unit and IsdG with two dimers in asymmetric unit. Both proteins assume a virtually identical ferredoxin-like fold consistent with their 64% sequence identity (78% similarity) (Fig. 1). The IsdI and IsdG structures can be superimposed with root mean square deviation 1.03 Å over 100 residues. The distance matrix alignment analysis placed these two proteins in the α+β sandwich superfold family, defined by the ferredoxin-like α+β sandwich with an anti-parallel β-sheet. Each monomer is assembled into a very tight dimer (Fig. 2) similar to the ActVA-Orf6 monooxygenase from Streptomyces coelicolor (Protein Data Bank entry 1LQ9) (21Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), a protein with little sequence similarity to IsdG and IsdI. The structures can be superimposed with root mean square deviation 1.92 Å over 112 residues. IsdG and IsdI also show structural similarity to several other proteins in the Protein Data Bank. The closest structural homolog is TT1380, a hypothetical protein from Thermus thermophilus (root mean square deviation 1.89 Å, 102 residues; Protein Data Bank entry 1IUJ). Other structural homologs include proteins with ferredoxin-like folds such as the hypothetical protein YjcS from Bacillus subtilis (Protein Data Bank entry 1Q8B). IsdG amino acid numbering is used throughout the text to describe the structures and results of functional analysis.Fig. 2Stereo image of the IsdI dimer.

The barrel is built of two smaller sheets that are connected by long C-terminal strands crossing over from one monomer to the other providing important interactions within the dimer. The core of the barrel is mainly hydrophobic with several residues presented by β-sheets and engaged in van der Waals' contacts (Met1, Met4, Phe39, Leu55, Leu57, Ile97, Ile101, Met106, and their symmetry mates). Interestingly, the hydrophobic core of the structural homolog ActVA-Orf6 is composed of different side chains that are engaged in different hydrophobic interactions. The sum of these interactions, however, amounts to a highly similar structure, even though ActVA-Orf6 displays only 15% sequence identity and 28% sequence similarity with IsdG (Fig. 4). One side of the IsdG and IsdI β-barrels is capped by strong salt bridges formed by four conserved acidic residues (Glu6 and Glu51 and their symmetry mates) and four basic residues (Arg8 and Lys53 and their symmetry mates). This interaction is strengthened by hydrogen bonding of Arg8 with Tyr99 residues. The other side of the β-barrel is very different in IsdG and IsdI. In IsdG, the β-barrel is capped by a ring of four methionines (Met1, Met106, and their symmetry mates) and a salt bridge between Asp36 and Lys107. These residues are not conserved between IsdI and IsdG. In IsdI, the β-barrel is capped by a rather unusual patch of six Gln residues (Gln35, Gln36, Gln107, and their symmetry mates). These glutamines are engaged in a very extensive H-bond network. Met1 provides a hydrophobic patch on this surface of IsdI. Phe49 assumes the corresponding role in IsdG. Three tyrosine residues on the β-barrel surface (Tyr24 from monomer A and Tyr103 and Tyr105 in the C-terminal β-strand of monomer B), conserved in both IsdG and IsdI, form stacking interactions and H-bonds between the monomers. The elaborate and extensive dimerization interface of the β-barrels of IsdG and IsdI provides a compact, stable scaffold in both proteins. Putative Active Site of IsdG and IsdI—Four short α-helices of each subunit decorate the outside of the IsdG and IsdI β-barrel. Two large, symmetry-related cavities are formed between these α-helices and the β-sheets of the β-barrel. All of the α-helices contribute residues to the cavity. The cavity includes the β-sheet residues 2-12 (β1) and residues 71-79 from α-helix 3 (Figs. 1, E and F, and 3D). A similar cavity was shown to nest the ActVA-Orf6 monooxygenase active site (21Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In IsdG and IsdI, the surface of this cavity is lined mainly with hydrophobic side chains. The edges of the cavity are hydrophilic with several positively and negatively charged residues resulting in a positively charged surface near the cavities and negatively charged surface further away. It appears that IsdG and IsdI dimers may present two separate cavities for heme binding and oxygenation. Interestingly, there is no obvious site for metal cofactor binding. IsdI and IsdG seem to carry out oxygenation of the heme without the assistance of any of the prosthetic groups or cofactors normally associated with activation of molecular oxygen. However, enzyme cofactors in the form of reductant or reductase are required for the reaction to proceed. The majority of residues lining the putative active site cavities are similar in IsdG and IsdI; however, conformation of some side chains in the cavity is different (for example Trp67 and His77), suggesting some flexibility and structural adjustments of the active site upon substrate (heme) binding. In fact, a loop located near the active site is disordered in both structures (residues 81-88 in IsdG and residues 80-87 in IsdI). The majority of the amino acid substitutions between IsdG and IsdI occur on the protein surface, whereas the electrostatic potential near the active site cavities is conserved. Conserved Residues in the Putative Active Site of IsdG Are Required for Heme Degradation—The dimeric β-barrel type structure of IsdG and IsdI is in stark contrast with the monomeric α-helical folding pattern of the heme oxygenase family, suggesting that they represent a novel family of heme-degrading enzymes. IsdG and IsdI homologs can be identified in numerous Gram-positive pathogens including Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, and Listeria monocytogenes, an important food-borne pathogen (Fig. 5A). Amino acid residues in the putative heme binding cavity, as well as at the interface between the monomers are highly conserved among members of the family (Figs. 1 and 4). The precise location of the active site could not be determined directly from the structures of free enzymes (without bound heme). Heme-binding proteins exhibit a characteristic absorption spectrum with the Soret band characteristic for the macrocyclic conjunction at ∼410 nm. IsdG-mediated heme degradation in the presence of an electron donor (e.g. ascorbic acid) can be monitored spectophotometrically as a decrease in the intensity of the Soret band at 412 nm (Fig. 5B). This assay allowed identification of IsdG mutants with decreased catalytic activity. Alanine substitution mutagenesis was performed for residues conserved in all members of the IsdG family (Fig. 5A) and/or predicted to be associated with the heme binding cavity (Fig. 1). Alanine substitution of Asn7, Trp67, and His77 abolished IsdG-mediated heme degradation (Fig. 5, B-I), demonstrating a strict requirement for these residues for the catalytic activity of IsdG. A second class of mutation was identified, exemplified by alanine substitution of Met38, that caused only slight reduction of heme degradation but shifted the peak absorbance of the Soret band to 430 nm, indicating changes in interaction between IsdG and heme. As a control, substitution of Ser70, Phe23, and Lys17, residues, predicted to be located outside of the catalytic pocket of IsdG, did not significantly affect heme binding or degradation (Fig. 5, B-I). These results corroborated our prediction that the heme binding cavity of IsdG is configured by the side chain residues of Asn7, Met38, Trp67, and His77 (Fig. 6). Based on the structure (Fig. 3), amino acid sequence comparisons (Figs. 4 and 5A), and molecular modeling (vide infra), we propose a three-dimensional model of heme binding to IsdG (Fig. 6). Heme-binding proteins often employ an electron bond between the imidazole moiety of a conserved histidine residue and the iron cation of heme (19Paoli M. Marles-Wright J. Smith A. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this model, His77, required for enzymatic activity, serves as the heme axial ligand (Fig. 6), and the polar Asn7 residue interacts with the hexacoordinate iron ion of the heme, on the opposite side of His77, stabilizing the reaction intermediate. Alternatively, hydrogen bonding of Asn7 with the heme iron-bound O2 facilitates self-hydroxylation of the porphyrin ring through a steric bending of the dioxygen, a mechanism recently proposed for the heme oxygenase family member HmuO (20Unno M. Matsui T. Chu G.C. Couture M. Yoshida T. Rousseau D.L. Olson J.S. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21055-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A possible role of Trp67, required for IsdG catalysis, is to properly position the heme tetrapyrrole moiety with respect to His77 and Asn7. Alternatively, Trp67 could stabilize the reaction intermediate of heme oxygenation through direct hydrogen bonding to either a ring nitrogen of the tetrapyrrole or through a H2O intermediate. In the orientation shown in Fig. 6, the hydrophobic methyl and vinyl groups of the heme are stabilized through interaction with the hydrophobic portion of its binding cavity comprised of residues Ile54, Met38, Phe64, and Trp67. In this orientation, the two propionate groups of heme are free to interact with the polar residue Thr25 and the positively charged residues Arg22 and His27 (Fig. 6). This suggestion is supported by changes in heme binding caused by substitution of Met38. Pfam analysis assigns IsdG and IsdI to the ActVA family of monooxygenases responsible for the oxidation of aromatic polyketides (5Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 436-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This enzyme family includes the ActVA-ORF6 from Streptomyces coelicolor (21Sciara G. Kendrew S.G.

Prod. 2001; 64: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and TcmH from Streptomyces glaucescens (23Summers R.G. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Motamedi H. Hutchinson C.R. J.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ActVA-Orf6 (6-deoxydihydrokalafungin (6-DDHK)) (21Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and IsdG/IsdI (heme) exhibit similar five- or six-member aromatic ring architecture (Fig. 7). In the absence of any significant amino acid conservation (Fig. 4), the structural conservation of ActVA-Orf6 (21Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), IsdG, and IsdI (Fig. 3) is striking. These representatives of both monooxygenases subfamilies crystallized as homodimers with two substrate binding cavities. Trp66 of ActVA-Orf6, Trp58 of IsdG, and Trp57 of IsdI occupy a structurally equivalent position in their respective substrate-binding sites. This residue is present in all members of the IsdG and ActVA family of monooxygenases. The Trp66 residue was proposed to stabilize ActVA-Orf6-6-DDHK complex through H-bonding (21Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Additionally, the carboxyl group of 6-DDHK extends from the active site pocket of ActVA-Orf6 and is exposed to solvent. This finding is consistent with our model of heme binding shown in Fig. 6. Differences in the substrate-binding pockets between the two subfamilies of monooxygenases can be explained by divergent substrate. Structurally equivalent asparagines Asn7 in IsdG, Asn6 in IsdI, and Asn62 in ActVA-Orf6 (21Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3E) are positioned such that they would clash with 6-DDHK (ActVA-Orf6 substrate) binding to IsdG and IsdI. Consequently, we predict that the IsdG substrate-binding site is located at a greater distance from the β-sheet component of the α+β sandwich fold, when compared with the substrate-binding site of ActVA-Orf6. Furthermore, Tyr72 of ActVA-Orf6 is replaced by phenylalanine in IsdG (Phe64) and IsdI (Phe63) (Fig. 3D). The smaller size of phenylalanine may be necessary to accommodate heme, a larger ligand. The position of the catalytic histidines of IsdG (His77) and IsdI (His76) is occupied by Trp39 in ActVA-Orf6 (Fig. 3E), further explaining the different substrate specificity. Histidine is a common heme axial ligand in many hemoproteins (19Paoli M. Marles-Wright J. Smith A. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We propose, based on earlier models for ActVA-Orf6 (21Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and heme oxygenase-mediated catalysis (20Unno M. Matsui T. Chu G.C. Couture M. Yoshida T. Rousseau D.L. Olson J.S. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21055-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), that hydroxylation of the heme porphyrin ring by IsdG and IsdI occurs via substrate self-hydroxylation. We predict that binding of heme in the cavity shown in Fig. 6 is followed by its reduction from the ferric to the ferrous form, thus allowing FeII-O2 binding. A subsequent electron transfer to heme may form an activated peroxide intermediate capable of hydroxylating the porphyrin ring. It seems plausible, that TT1380/1IUJ, a structural homolog of IsdG and IsdI from T. thermophilus, functions as a heme monooxygenase, suggesting that this bacterium is capable of degrading heme. The amino acid sequence of TT1380 is 27% identical to IsdG and 33% identical to IsdI and contains key residues of the IsdG/IsdI active site (Asn7, Trp67, and His77). The abundance of heme-iron provides a rich source of iron for bacterial pathogens of vertebrates. The convergent evolution of the heme oxygenase family and the IsdG heme monooxygenase family provides an opportunity to compare two distinct enzyme families involved in similar processes. Divergent evolution of the monooxygenase substrate specificity under selective pressure to acquire iron from the host seems to have lead to a new heme-degrading enzyme family.

https://openalex.org/W2015324181,"The hormone melatonin phase shifts circadian rhythms generated by the mammalian biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, through activation of G protein-coupled MT2 melatonin receptors. This study demonstrated that pretreatment with physiological concentrations of melatonin (30-300 pM or 7-70 pg/mL) decreased the number of hMT2 melatonin receptors heterologously expressed in mammalian cells in a time and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, hMT2-GFP melatonin receptors heterologously expressed in immortalized SCN2.2 cells or in non-neuronal mammalian cells were internalized upon pretreatment with both physiological (300 pM or 70 pg/mL) and supraphysiological (10 nM or 2.3 ng/mL) concentrations of melatonin. The decrease in MT2 melatonin receptor number induced by melatonin (300 pM for 1 h) was reversible and reached almost full recovery after 8 h; however, after treatment with 10 nM melatonin full recovery was not attained even after 24 h. This recovery process was partially protein synthesis dependent. Furthermore, exposure to physiological concentrations of melatonin (300 pM) for a time mimicking the nocturnal surge (8 h) desensitized functional responses mediated through melatonin activation of endogenous MT2 receptors, i.e., stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) in immortalized SCN2.2 cells and phase shifts of circadian rhythms of neuronal firing in the rat SCN brain slice. We conclude that in vivo the nightly secretion of melatonin desensitizes endogenous MT2 melatonin receptors in the mammalian SCN thereby providing a temporally integrated profile of sensitivity of the mammalian biological clock to a melatonin signal."
https://openalex.org/W2006089129,"We have recently identified an inducible nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) regulator, IκB-ζ, which is induced by microbial ligands for Toll-like receptors such as lipopolysaccharide and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β but not by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In the present study, we examined mechanisms for stimulus-specific induction of IκB-ζ. The analysis of the IκB-ζ promoter revealed an essential role for an NF-κB binding sequence in transcriptional activation. The activation, however, did not account for the Toll-like receptor/IL-1 receptor-specific induction of IκB-ζ, because the promoter analysis and nuclear run-on analysis indicated that its transcription was similarly induced by TNF-α. To examine post-transcriptional regulation, we analyzed the decay of IκB-ζ mRNA, and we found that it was specifically stabilized by lipopolysaccharide or IL-1β but not by TNF-α. Furthermore, we found that costimulation with TNF-α and another proinflammatory cytokine, IL-17, elicited the IκB-ζ induction. Stimulation with IL-17 alone did not induce IκB-ζ but stabilized its mRNA. Therefore, IκB-ζ induction requires both NF-κB activation and stimulus-specific stabilization of its mRNA. Because IκB-ζ is essential for expression of a subset of NF-κB target genes, the stimulus-specific induction of IκB-ζ may be of great significance in regulation of inflammatory reactions.

Cells reprogram gene expression upon environmental changes to maintain homeostasis. For multicellular organisms, serious environmental changes include microbial infection, and a major rearrangement of gene expression occurs during inflammatory responses against infection. The expression of a variety of genes for inflammatory mediators is strongly activated upon stimulation with microbial and viral products that stimulate toll-like receptors (TLRs), 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL-1R, IL-1 receptor; TIR, Toll/IL-1R; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; NGAL, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin; GRO, growth-related oncogene; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ORF, open reading frame; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ARE, AU-rich elements. and with inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α.

It consists of homo- and heterodimers of Rel/NF-κB family proteins with the Rel homology domain, which is implicated in both DNA binding and dimer formation. In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm via association with cytosolic IκB proteins, IκB-α, -β, and -ϵ, through interaction between the ankyrin repeats of the IκB proteins and the Rel domains of NF-κB. Upon stimulation, the cytosolic IκB proteins are phosphorylated followed by ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation, and NF-κB translocates into the nucleus where it engages in active transcription of the target genes. One of the NF-κB target genes is IκB-α, and the re-synthesized IκB-α binds to the nuclear NF-κB to export it to the cytoplasm and terminate the sequence of the reactions (1Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev.

Modulators of the nuclear NF-κB include histone deacetylases (9Ashburner B.P. Westerheide S.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7065-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), transcriptional coactivator and corepressor proteins (10Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12485-12488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have identified a new nuclear IκB protein, IκB-ζ (also named as MAIL or INAP), which interacts with NF-κB via a C-terminal ankyrin repeat domain in the nucleus (14Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). IκB-ζ is barely able to be detected in resting cells but is robustly induced in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The induced IκB-ζ localizes in the nucleus and preferentially interacts with the NF-κB p50 subunit rather than the p65 subunit. The initial characterization of IκB-ζ has shown that it negatively regulates NF-κB activity, because transfection of IκB-ζ inhibits NF-κB reporter activity stimulated with LPS, IL-1β, or TNF-α, and inhibits activity induced by transfection of the NF-κB p65 subunit. On the other hand, subsequent functional analyses of the N-terminal region of IκB-ζ revealed that it had a latent activity of transcriptional activation. 2M. Motoyama and T. Muta, unpublished data. In addition, the most recent studies using IκB-ζ-deficient mice demonstrated that IκB-ζ is essential for the induction of a subset of the inflammatory genes including IL-6, the IL-12 p40 subunit, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (17Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of IκB-ζ depends on the p50 subunit, which exhibits target DNA binding activity without the transactivation activity (17Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Detailed analyses on the induction of IκB-ζ showed that not only LPS but also other microbial TLR ligands including peptidoglycan, the bacterial lipopeptides, and CpG DNA elicited IκB-ζ (17Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S.

Commun. 2003; 301: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to these microbial products, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β strongly induced IκB-ζ (14Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). TLRs and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) share similar cytoplasmic domains known as Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain and the common adaptor molecule MyD88 (19Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 20Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6702) Google Scholar). As expected, the induction of IκB-ζ by the TLR ligands is dependent on MyD88 (17Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Prominent cellular responses triggered by activation of TLR/IL-1R include activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and our previous studies have revealed that NF-κB is essential for IκB-ζ induction (18Eto A. Muta T. Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Another proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α also activates both NF-κB and MAP kinases, which is similar to TLR ligands or IL-1β. However, IκB-ζ induction by TNF-α was marginal, indicating that NF-κB activation is not sufficient for the induction of IκB-ζ (14Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of the NF-κB subunits resulted in robust induction of IκB-α but not IκB-ζ, leading to the conclusion that an additional signal derived from the TIR domain is required for IκB-ζ induction (18Eto A. Muta T. Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although IL-1β and TNF-α do not share sequence homology with each other and they bind to distinct receptors, the intracellular signaling activated by the two cytokines converges to similar adaptor molecules, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2 and TRAF6, each of which leads to the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases (1Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3328) Google Scholar, 21Kracht M. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 2002; 20: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Consequently, many of the target genes for IL-1β and TNF-α overlap, and the two proinflammatory cytokines give rise to similar biological effects exemplified by inflammation, coagulation, or pyrexia. The biological effects, however, are not identical between the two cytokines. In addition to IκB-ζ, several other genes are preferentially induced by IL-1β but not by TNF-α. These genes are neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) (22Cowland J.B. Sorensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the growth-related oncogene (GRO)α homolog/the KC chemokine (23Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Tebo J.M. Datta S. Kishore R. Kolosov M. Major J.A. Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol.

Hutchinson N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17238-17245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and IL-6 (26Ng S.B. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19021-19027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Elias J.A. Lentz V. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 161-166PubMed Google Scholar, 28Katz Y. Strunk R.C. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3862-3867PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of complement factor H was up-regulated by TNF-α but not by IL-1β (28Katz Y. Strunk R.C. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3862-3867PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter analysis of NGAL showed that it is preferentially activated by IL-1β rather than by TNF-α, implying that the differential induction is determined at the transcriptional level. Therefore, an IL-1β-specific transcriptional activator(s) or a TNF-α-specific repressor(s) exists (22Cowland J.B. Sorensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In fact, IκB-ζ has been shown to be one of the essential factors for expression of a subset of inflammatory genes such as IL-6 and NGAL (17Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The NF-κB p50 subunit is required for the function of IκB-ζ, and only IκB-ζ is preferentially induced upon stimulation with IL-1β and TLR ligands but not with TNF-α. Therefore, IκB-ζ might play a role as a master gene that determines the expression of a subset of the inflammatory genes. In the present study, we analyzed molecular mechanisms for the differential induction of IκB-ζ. We found that stability of IκB-ζ mRNA was specifically up-regulated by stimulation with LPS or IL-1β but not with TNF-α. This finding indicates that in addition to NF-κB activation, the other signal required for IκB-ζ induction, which comes from the TIR domain but not from the TNF-α receptor, leads to mRNA stabilization. Given the essential function of IκB-ζ in the expression of a series of inflammatory genes, the control of IκB-ζ expression by different stimuli may play a key role in determining the nature of inflammation. Cell Culture, Reagents, and Antibodies—NIH3T3, RAW264.7, and A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. THP-1 cells were in RPMI 1640 with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 was purchased from List Biological Laboratories Inc. (Campbell, CA). IL-1β, IL-17, and TNF-α were from Genzyme Techne Corp. (Framingham, MA). Actinomycin D and G418 were from Nakalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Anti-IκB-ζ polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal region (anti-IκB-ζ(C)) or IκB-ζ(L)-specific region (anti-IκB-ζ(LN)) was raised as follows. A cDNA fragment for the C-terminal region (amino acids 414–728) or the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–99) of mouse IκB-ζ was subcloned into pQE-30 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), or pMALg (14Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli as His6-tagged, glutathione S-transferase (GST)- or maltose-binding protein-fusion proteins. The His6-tagged recombinant protein of the C-terminal region was immunized to a rabbit, and the antiserum that was obtained was subjected to affinity purification using Affi-Gel-10 resin (Bio-Rad) coupled with the corresponding recombinant GST-fusion protein. The anti-IκB-ζ(L)-specific antiserum was raised against the GST-fusion protein of the N-terminal region and was affinity-purified with the maltose-binding protein-fusion protein. Antibodies against IκB-α, β-tubulin, and p38 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-active p38 antibody was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Plasmids—The pELAM1-Luc reporter plasmid was described previously (29Muta T. Takeshige K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4580-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and pNF-κB-Luc that contained four tandem κB sequences was purchased from Clontech. Genomic fragments of mouse or human IκB-ζ were obtained by screening a genomic library or by PCR with genomic DNA and subcloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega). cDNAs for mouse MyD88, IκB-ζ(L), and IκB-ζ(S) were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR of RNA from RAW264.7 cells and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A dominant-negative form of MyD88 (amino acids 155 to the C terminus) was created by PCR. An expression plasmid for the full-length IκB-ζ mRNA driven by chicken β-actin promoter (pAG-mIκB-ζ) was constructed by subcloning the following fragment in pBluescript SKII(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The subcloned fragment contained the chicken β-actin promoter and the rabbit β-globin splicing sequence derived from pCNX2 (30Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar) followed by full-length mouse IκB-ζ(L) mRNA (+27 to +4005) including G/U-rich and U-rich sequences beyond the polyadenylation site, which is recognized by the 3′ end-processing complex. The expression plasmids for chimeric mRNAs (pAG-ζ-Luc-ζ, pAG-ζ-ζ-Luc-ζ, and pAG-ζ-Luc-ζ-ζ) were constructed by replacing various parts of pAG-mIκB-ζ with the open reading frame (ORF) of firefly luciferase derived from pGL3-basic. The parts of pAG-mIκB-ζ that were replaced were the entire ORF, the C-terminal region from an internal NcoI site, or the N-terminal region to the NcoI site of the ORF of IκB-ζ. All sequences amplified by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Stable Cell Line—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pAG-mIκB-ζ and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) at a ratio of 10:1. The cells resistant to G418 were selected in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml G418 and cloned. The expression of IκB-ζ mRNA was determined by Northern blot analysis. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) or Effectene (Qiagen). Two days after transfection, the cells were stimulated at 37 °C for 6 h. Luciferase activities were measured by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega). The transfection efficiency was normalized by the Renilla luciferase activity derived from pRL-TK. Nuclear Run-on Assay—The nuclear run-on assay was performed as described previously (23Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated nuclei from stimulated cells were incubated in the presence of [α-32P]rUTP with rATP, rCTP, and rGTP at 30 °C for 30 min, and the synthesized transcript was hybridized with a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell) that had been blotted with cDNA for a target gene at 65 °C overnight. The membrane was washed with 30 mm NaCl and 3 mm sodium citrate (0.2× SSC) that contained 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate, was exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji Photo Film, Osaka, Japan), and was analyzed by STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). IκB-ζ Is Specifically Induced by Stimulation of TLR/IL-1R— Our previous studies have demonstrated the essential requirement of an unidentified signal(s) for IκB-ζ induction that comes from the TIR domain, in addition to NF-κB activation (18Eto A. Muta T. Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, an alternative possibility to explain the inability of TNF-α to induce IκB-ζ could be that a negative signal was specifically generated by TNF-α stimulation. In order to examine this possibility, we treated cells with LPS or IL-1β together with TNF-α. LPS- or IL-1β-stimulation of NIH3T3 cells resulted in the strong induction of IκB-ζ. Although TNF-α similarly induced other NF-κB target genes such as IκB-α and A20, TNF-α-stimulation of the cells induced little IκB-ζ, as described previously (Fig. 1A) (14Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Costimulation with TNF-α did not affect the LPS- or IL-1β-mediated induction of IκB-ζ (Fig. 1A), thus ruling out the possibility of a negative signal by TNF-α. The expression of IκB-ζ was dependent on de novo transcription because the induction of IκB-ζ by LPS or IL-1β was completely abolished by treating the cells with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription. In the current conditions, the stimulation of NIH3T3 cells with LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α activated NF-κB to a similar extent when measured with an NF-κB reporter, pELAM1-Luc (29Muta T. Takeshige K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4580-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). NF-κB activation by LPS or IL-1β, but not that by TNF-α, was specifically inhibited by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of MyD88, a TLR/IL-1R-specific adaptor molecule (19Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 20Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6702) Google Scholar). The stimulus-specific induction of IκB-ζ was also observed in A549 cells, which are a well characterized human alveolar type II epithelial cell line (Fig. 1C). In addition, the stimulus-specific induction of IκB-ζ was observed in HEK293 or THP-1 cells (data not shown). This indicated that the preferential induction of IκB-ζ by activation of TLR/IL-1R is not cell type-specific and is conserved between mouse and human. Induction of endogenous IκB-ζ protein was examined by immunoblotting with an antibody raised against a recombinant protein containing the C-terminal region of IκB-ζ (anti-IκB-ζ(C)). An 85-kDa band that reacted with the antibody appeared 40 min after stimulation in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2A) and in NIH3T3 cells stimulated with LPS or IL-1β (Fig. 2B). A faint band of 70-kDa also appeared at ∼60 min after the stimulation. In contrast to the cytosolic IκB proteins including IκB-α,-β,or-ϵ,IκB-ζ was barely detected in unstimulated cells, and rapid degradation after the stimulation was not observed. The IκB-ζ protein level peaked at 1–2 h after stimulation (Fig. 2A) and then gradually decreased (data not shown). Consistent with the mRNA induction, IκB-ζ protein was strongly induced by LPS or IL-1β, but we observed minimum induction by TNF-α (Fig. 2B). Immunoblotting with the anti-active p38 antibody showed that p38 MAP kinase was activated by TNF-α, LPS, or IL-1β. Therefore, the preferential expression of IκB-ζ protein was primarily regulated by the level of the mRNA. Two types of mRNAs for IκB-ζ have been identified, which are most likely generated by an alternative splicing (14Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Kitamura H. Kanehira K. Okita K. Morimatsu M. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Haruta H. Kato A. Todokoro K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12485-12488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Shiina T. Morimatsu M. Kitamura H. Ito T. Kidou S. Matsubara K. Matsuda Y. Saito M. Syuto B. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The shorter form, IκB-ζ(S), lacks the exon 3 harboring the initiation codon for the longer form, IκB-ζ(L), thus coding for a shorter protein beginning at a downstream initiation codon without the N-terminal 99 amino acids of IκB-ζ(L). The transfected IκB-ζ(L) exhibited a mobility similar to that of the main 85-kDa band (Fig. 2C). Immunoreactivity of the 85-kDa band with an IκB-ζ(L)-specific antibody (anti-IκB-ζ(LN)), raised against the N-terminal IκB-ζ(L)-specific sequence, identified this band as IκB-ζ(L) (Fig. 2C). The 70-kDa band reacted with the anti-IκB-ζ(C) antibody but not with the IκB-ζ(L)-specific antibody, suggesting that it was derived from IκB-ζ(S). Transfected IκB-ζ(S) also showed a mobility similar to that of the 70-kDa band, further supporting its identity as IκB-ζ(S). Thus, the dominant product of the IκB-ζ gene upon stimulation with LPS or IL-1β was IκB-ζ(L). The 85-kDa IκB-ζ(L) band shifted slightly upward and appeared as a doublet band after stimulation, suggesting covalent modifications. Resistance to phosphatase treatment indicated that the modification was not phosphorylation (data not shown). However, the identity of the modification is unknown at present. The Preferential Induction of IκB-ζ Determines the Expression of the Target Gene—The analyses of IκB-ζ-deficient mice have revealed that IκB-ζ is essential for the expression of a subset of NF-κB target genes (17Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Therefore, stimulus-specific induction of IκB-ζ should be reflected by the subsequent expression of these genes. NIH3T3 cells were stimulated under the same conditions as shown in Fig. 1. We then examined the induction of IL-6, a representative gene that requires IκB-ζ for expression. The expression of IL-6 was more strongly induced by LPS or IL-1β than by TNF-α, similar to that observed for IκB-ζ (Fig. 3A). The induction pattern was similar between IκB-ζ and IL-6, but the kinetics of the induction were different. IL-6 mRNA peaked at 2 h after stimulation with LPS or IL-1β in NIH3T3 cells, but it reached a peak at 4 h after stimulation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3B). In either case, IκB-ζ was induced more rapidly than IL-6 and peaked at 1 h after the stimulation. These observations are consistent with the concept that IκB-ζ controls the expression of IL-6. NF-κB Sites in the Promoter Are Essential for the Transcriptional Up-regulation of the IκB-ζ Gene—We obtained genomic fragments corresponding to mouse and human IκB-ζ promoter regions to analyze the transcriptional regulation of the IκB-ζ gene. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends analyses using poly(A)-tailed RNA from RAW264.7 cells or THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS identified several possible transcription initiation sites. The main initiation site is indicated by a box labeled as +1 in Fig. 4A. The nucleotide sequences around the transcription initiation site were well conserved between mouse and human and were preceded by a potential TATA box. The reporter analysis in RAW264.7 cells with serially deleted fragments of the mouse promoter region showed that reporters with promoter fragments containing a region spanning -359 bp to the initiation site were activated upon LPS stimulation. The minimal IκB-ζ promoter responded more strongly to LPS stimulation than an artificial promoter with four tandem copies of the NF-κB consensus sequence (4× κB). Thus, the cis-element(s) responsible for LPS responsiveness is present within -359 bp from the transcription initiation site (Fig. 4B). We identified three canonical κB sites in the proximal promoter region of the mouse IκB-ζ promoter, and we defined them as κB1 (-256 to -247), κB2 (-218 to -209), and κB3 (-83 to -74). Although the κB1 and κB2 sites were completely conserved between the mouse and human IκB-ζ promoters, the κB3 sequence was poorly matched with the κB consensus sequence and was not conserved between the two species. We introduced a mutation into each of the sites to examine the contributions of these κB sites to the induction of IκB"
https://openalex.org/W2018138792,"Latently infected Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes-virus (KSHV)-associated tumor cells have both endothelial and lymphoid origins and express a limited set of latent viral genes. One such gene, ORF73, encodes the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), a multifunctional protein that plays roles in viral DNA replication, episome maintenance, and transcriptional regulation. LANA interacts with cellular proteins involved in transcriptional regulation such as the tumor suppressors, retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53, and RING3 family members. Although several reports about specific LANA-regulated promoters exist, only limited data are available that address how LANA expression in KSHV-infected cells globally affects cellular gene expression, thereby potentially contributing to KSHV pathogenicity. To investigate this question, we generated an Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitts lymphoma line that expresses LANA from a tetracycline-inducible promoter (BJAB/Tet-On/LANA), and we performed microarray-based gene expression profiling. Expression profiling at different time points post-induction revealed that 186 genes were activated or repressed over 2-fold in the presence of LANA. Of these genes, 41 are regulated in the Rb/E2F pathway, whereas 7 are related to p53 signaling. To determine whether these gene expression changes translate into LANA-dependent changes in cell cycle regulation, we overexpressed p16 INK4a, a CDK4/6 inhibitor that efficiently induces cell cycle arrest in Rb-positive cells. Under these conditions, LANA expression protects lymphoid cells from p16 INK4a-induced cell cycle arrest and induces S-phase entry.

LANA is a multifunctional protein and shows functional homology to DNA replication/transcription proteins such as SV40 large T antigen of polyomaviruses, EBNA-1 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and E1/E2 of human papillomaviruses. LANA is the only viral protein required for latent viral DNA replication and segregation in latently infected cells (9Ballestas M.E. Chatis P.A. Kaye K.M.

Virol. 2002; 76: 11677-11678Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).In addition to its role in genome maintenance, LANA interacts with a variety of host cellular proteins to regulate viral and cellular gene expression. Among these cellular proteins are mSin3 and RING3, proteins that belong to a large family of chromatin-associated factors involved in transcriptional suppression (13Platt G. Carbone A. Mittnacht S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1823-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Krithivas A. Young D.B. Liao G. Greene D. Hayward S.D. J.

LANA also interacts with the tumor suppressors Rb and p53, thereby stimulating transcription from a cyclin E promoter and suppressing a p53-binding site-containing reporter. Furthermore, co-expression of LANA and H-Ras in rat embryonic fibroblasts (but not expression of LANA alone) leads to colony formation and suggests that LANA may contribute to tumorigenesis (17Friborg J. Kong W. Hottiger M.O. Nabel G.J. Nature. 2000; 402: 889-894Crossref Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 18Radkov S.A. Kellam P. Boshoff C. Nat.

Med. 2003; 9: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) demonstrated that LANA signals through the wnt pathway by stabilizing β-catenin, thereby promoting S-phase entry into endothelial cells. Together, these data suggest that LANA globally modulates cellular gene expression in latently infected cells.A limited number of LANA-responsive promoters have been identified by transient transfection studies. LANA, like EBNA-1 of EBV, positively regulates its own synthesis. Several promoters such as interleukin-6, telomerase, and the human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat are activated or repressed by LANA (14Krithivas A. Young D.B. Liao G. Greene D.

No cellular genes regulated in either the Rb, p53, or the wnt pathway have been identified as LANA targets.To identify LANA-responsive genes, we created inducible LANA expression lines in lymphoid cells and performed microarray-based gene expression profiling (26Alon U. Barkai N. Notterman D.A. Gish K. Ybarra S. Mack D. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6745-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar, 27Brown P.O. Botstein D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). After identifying cellular genes that were altered in their expression in the presence of LANA, we demonstrate that the observed changes in gene expression translate into cell cycle regulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines—BJAB and DG75 cells (both EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines) were generously provided by Dr. Elliot Kieff, Harvard University. Primary effusion lymphoma cell lines (BCBL-1, BC-1, and BC-3) have been described previously (2Cesarman E. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Said J.W. Knowles D.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2483) Google Scholar, 28Arvanitakis L. Mesri E.A. Nador R.G. Said J.W. Asch A.S. Knowles D.M. Cesarman E.

All lymphoid cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm l-glutamine.To generate B cell lines that express LANA from a tetracycline-inducible promoter (30Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar), 5 × 106 BJAB cells were transfected with 12 μg of linearized pTet-On (Clontech) by electroporation (250 V, 950 micro-farads) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. For selection, cultures were grown in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. Resistant clones were generated 2-3 weeks post-transfection by limited dilution, and single cell clones were expanded. Transient transfection assays utilizing a tetracycline-responsive promoter construct driving luciferase were used to screen more than 100 individual clones. One clone was selected that showed a 22-fold induction of luciferase activity with doxycycline (Dox) treatment and no background expression, compared with commercially available Jurkat/Tet-On and 293/Tet-On cells (Clontech). This clone along with Jurkat/Tet-On and 293/Tet-On cells was transfected with the linearized pTRE2hyg containing the full-length LANA coding region downstream of a TRE-containing promoter. After subcloning 80-100 clones for each cell line and analyzing LANA expression in the absence and presence of Dox by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence, we selected one clone each for further characterization and gene expression profiling based on the following criteria: (i) no detectable background level of LANA, and (ii) high levels of LANA expression after induction.Gene Expression Profiling and Data Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from 4 × 107 cells using RNAzol (Teltest Inc., Friendswood, TX) as recommended by the manufacturer. Induction protocol and time schedules for RNA extraction post-induction of LANA expression are described in Fig. 2A. Prior to gene expression profiling, each RNA preparation was analyzed by Northern blot using LANA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-specific radiolabeled probes (Fig. 2B).Gene expression profiling was performed by the Case Western Reserve University and Ireland Cancer Center Gene Expression core facility using Affymetrix technology. Oligonucleotide-based HG-U95Av2 arrays containing 12,626 probe sets corresponding to known human genes and ESTs (www.affymetrix.com) were used for all experiments. Selection of poly(A)+ mRNA, reverse transcription, and generation of biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP (Ensue Diagnostics)-labeled cRNA by T7 in vitro transcription were performed as recommended by Affymetrix. Prior to HG-U95Av2 chip hybridization, a test chip containing 100 probe sets was probed with an aliquot of the cRNA preparation. 75 μg of cRNA were used for each chip. Samples were run on the fully automated Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics station, which performs all steps from hybridization to washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes). The arrays were scanned using a Hewlett-Packard confocal microscope scanner (Affymetrix) at a wave-length of 560 nm.Prior to data analysis, we determined the percentage of “present” and “marginal present” genes for each array, which was greater than 40% for each experiment. The signal ratio of 3′ to 5′ probe sets for GAPDH and actin was less than 2, indicating efficient reverse transcription and high RNA quality. Repeated array hybridizations for identical RNA samples were performed to evaluate the stability of our chip data. For comparisons across experiments, the scale factor was used to normalize the average signal of each array to 1500. Hybridization data were analyzed by Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS 5.0) software. Gene fold changes were determined based on the signal log ratio parameter. Microsoft access was used for all pairwise comparisons and to determine common changes between multiple data sets.The following criteria were applied to raw data to determine changes in gene expression levels. Up-regulated genes must be present or marginal present, and expression levels should be greater than 500 in one sample; fold changes should be “+2 or more,” and the change call should be “increase” or “marginal increase.” Down-regulated genes must be present or marginal present, and expression levels should be greater than 500 in one sample; fold changes should be “-2 or less,” and the change call should be “decrease” or “marginal decrease.” We used the GeneSpring 4.2 software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) to perform hierarchical cluster analysis between data sets and to create Venn diagrams outlining common changes between different cell lines. Raw data are available at NCBI GEO web page accession number GSE1880.Confirmation of Selected Genes by Northern Blot Analysis and Real Time RT-PCR—Northern blotting and hybridization have been described previously (23Renne R. Barry C. Dittmer D. Compitello N. Brown P. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). 5 μg of total RNA was electrophoretically separated on denaturing agarose gels, blotted to Hybond membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to specific probes overnight at 65 °C in Church buffer (31Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7258) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Redivue random priming kit (Amersham Biosciences).To eliminate contaminating DNA, 10 μg of total RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) prior to cDNA synthesis. As an additional control, reverse transcription reactions were performed in the presence and absence of RT and amplified by regular PCR using GAPDH primers. For reverse transcription, 500 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT (Invitrogen) was used in a total 50-μl reaction volume containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 15 units of RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen), and 2.5 μl of oligo(dT)12-18 primer (Invitrogen). Reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 35 min, followed by 95 °C for 5 min.Real time quantitative PCR was performed on a LightCycler3 (Roche Diagnostics). One μl of cDNA was added to 2 μl of Mastermix (Light-Cycler Faststart DNA master hybridization probes, Roche Diagnostics) in a total volume of 20 μl containing 3 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1.5 μmol/liter of each 3′ and 5′ primers. Reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 PCR cycles (15 s 95 °C and 60 s 58 °C). SYBR green fluorescence was measured at the end of each cycle. Threshold values were set at the midpoint SYBR green fluorescence and the threshold cycle (CT) was determined as the cycle at which a statistically significant increase in fluorescence was initially detected. Primers were designed based on Affymetrix probe sets for each target gene using primer 3 input software (primer3-www.cgi V 0.2) (supplemental Table 1). These primers and those for GAPDH were included in parallel reactions. Gene expression signals at the point of threshold cycle were normalized to GAPDH as an endogenous reference. A standard curve was generated by amplifying GAPDH from four 10-fold serial dilutions from a cDNA template that resulted in 0.35 cycles/fold change. To allow comparison between array data and real time PCR, the difference of CT values between samples was converted to fold changes.Protein Analysis by Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence Assays—Immunofluorescence assays to detect LANA were performed as described previously (23Renne R. Barry C. Dittmer D. Compitello N. Brown P. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were spotted onto Teflon-coated slides, fixed with methanol/acetone, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. To detect LANA (ORF73), a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against three ORF73 peptides from its central repeat domain was used (66Polson A.G. Wang D. DeRisi J. Ganem D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4525-4530PubMed Google Scholar). As secondary antibody, a fluorescent isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit was used (1:100 in blocking buffer). Photographs were taken by using either an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Inc.) or a confocal microscope (Leica, Inc.).For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nylon membranes. To detect LANA, we used a polyclonal serum as described above; for β-catenin, we used a rabbit antibody (Sigma) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. As loading control, all membranes were re-probed using tubulin-specific monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Boston).Cell Cycle Analysis after p16 INK4a Treatment—BJAB and BJAB/Tet-On/LANA Dox-treated or untreated were either mock-infected or infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing p16 INK4a (32Knudsen K.E. Fribourg A.F. Strobeck M.W. Blanchard J.M. Knudsen E.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5239-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and recombinant adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (kindly provided by Dr. Steven Fisher, Case Western Reserve University) at a ratio of 3:1. 40-45 h post-infection, cells were stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 at 37 °C for 30 min, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. Cell cycle analysis was performed on a LSR1 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The DNA histogram was created by gating on GFP+ cells, and raw data were further analyzed by ModFit LT 3.0 software.RESULTSGeneration of LANA-inducible Cell Lines—The majorities of cells within PELs, MCD, and KS skin lesions are latently infected with KSHV and express a limited number of viral genes. Although all KSHV-associated tumors express LANA, latent gene expression regarding additional viral genes that can influence cellular gene expression (i.e. v-Cyclin, v-FLIP, LANA2 (vIRF-3), Kaposin (K12), and K15 substantially varies between KSHV-associated tumor types (for review see Refs. 33Ganem D. Cell. 1997; 91: 157-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and 34Schulz T.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1573-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).In this study, we focused on how LANA contributes to global cellular gene expression by generating B cell lines that express LANA from a tetracycline-inducible promoter (30Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). The advantage of this approach is that we can measure the effect of a single viral protein on cellular gene expression in an otherwise isogenic background. To generate LANA-inducible cells, we chose BJAB, a Burkitt's lymphoma-derived (BL) EBV-negative cell line, which has been used previously to stably express LANA (9Ballestas M.E. Chatis P.A. Kaye K.M. Science. 1999; 284: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 23Renne R. Barry C. Dittmer D. Compitello N. Brown P. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Briefly, cells were transfected with pTet-On expressing the tetracycline-inducible RTA transactivator. Cells were selected, and after single cell cloning, inducibility was compared with highly inducible and commercially available 293/Tet-On cells using transient transfection assays. Next, selected clones were transfected with pTRE2/LANA, and a second round of selection and single cell cloning was performed. After expansion, we tested for LANA expression in the absence and presence of Dox to identify clones of each cell line that exhibited low background and high inducibility. Fig. 1 shows the induction kinetic of BJAB/Tet-On/LANA as well as 293/Tet-On/LANA and Jurkat/Tet-On/LANA cells; LANA was undetectable in the absence of Dox but highly expressed in the presence of Dox. In BJAB/Tet-On/LANA cells, maximum expression levels were reached between 12 and 24 h post-Dox treatment that is comparable with those levels observed in BCBL-1 cells (Fig. 1) and (23Renne R. Barry C. Dittmer D. Compitello N. Brown P. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Fig. 1Generation of LANA-inducible cell lines. Tetracycline-inducible cells established from single cell clones were induced for the indicated times and analyzed for LANA expression by Western blot analysis. Whereas no LANA expression is detectable before Dox treatment, high levels of LANA are expressed by 24 h post-induction in all three cell lines. Identical blots were stripped and re-probed with a tubulin antibody as loading control. LANA shows a characteristic doublet at 220 kDa. Bands at lower molecular weights are degradation products that are also observed in KSHV-infected PEL cell lines (23Renne R. Barry C. Dittmer D. Compitello N. Brown P. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A, BJAB/Tet-On/LANA. B, 293/Tet-On/LANA. C, Jurkat/Tet-On/LANA. D, LANA expressed in BJAB/Tet-On/LANA cells trans-represses TR-dependent transcription from a luciferase reporter. Uninduced and induced cells were transfected by electroporation with a luciferase reporter containing 7 copies of TR. In the presence of Dox, luciferase was down-regulated 2.2-fold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To ensure that LANA is functional in these cell lines, two assays were performed. Previously, we have shown that LANA trans-represses the enhancer activity of the viral terminal repeat (TR) which is dependent on the ability of LANA to bind to TR (35Garber A.C. Shu M.A. Hu J. Renne R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7882-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays in BJAB/Tet-On cells showed that a TR-containing reporter was repressed in the presence of LANA (Dox+) at 48 h post-induction (Fig. 1D); similar results were obtained for 293/Tet-On/LANA cells (data not shown). LANA is the only viral protein required for long term maintenance of TR-containing plasmids (10Ballestas M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3250-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 12Hu J. Garber A.C. Renne R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11677-11678Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Transfection of a plasmid containing two copies of TR and a GFP reporter leads to long term maintenance in induced BJAB/Tet-On/LANA cells. 2R. Johnson and R. Renne, manuscript in preparation. These experiments illustrate the functionality of LANA in BJAB/Tet-On/LANA cells because it binds to DNA and supports replication and maintenance of TR-containing plasmids.In BJAB Cells, Expression Levels of 186 Genes Are Significantly Altered in the Presence of LANA—In the first set of experiments, we analyzed the effect of LANA on cellular gene expression by comparing Dox-induced cells to noninduced cells over time. A single cell culture at a density of 2 × 105/ml was divided into mock- and Dox-treated cells, and total RNA was extracted at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Prior to gene expression profiling, RNA quality and LANA protein expression were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Synthesis of cRNA, hybridization, washing, and raw data analysis were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” We used the oligonucleotide array HG-U95Av2 (Affymetrix, Inc.), which represents more than 12,000 known human genes and ESTs.Fig. 2 outlines the experimental design and provides the number of observed gene expression changes at each time point post-induction in BJAB/Tet-On/LANA cells. At 12 h, expression levels in induced compared with mock-induced cells revealed only 17 changes. In contrast, 450 changes were observed when comparing profiles from Dox-treated LANA-expressing BJAB/Tet-On/LANA cells at 36 to 12 h post-induction. Notably, the control comparison between 36 and 12 h in the absence of Dox also revealed 299 changes, of which 163 overlapped with the above 450 changes (Dox+), suggesting that these changes are the result of the growth conditions (increasing cell density over time) and occurred independent of LANA expression. We sub-tracted these 163 genes from the original 450. Following further analysis of these 163 genes, we identified 28 that were induced or repressed more than 2-fold when LANA was present; therefore, these gene changes were re-entered in the analysis. Comparison of induced and control cells at 24 h post-induction revealed an additional 79 genes. Comparison of cells at 48 to 36 h post-induction yielded 12 additional gene changes. Subsequently, we observed differential gene expression with significant p values as determined by the Wilcoxon's signed rank test (MAS 5.0 software) for a total of 423 probe sets in the presence of LANA.To define further the group of differentially expressed cellular genes, we applied two additional exclusion criteria. First, probe sets expressed at very low levels (whose mean fluorescent signal intensities did not reach 500 at any time point) were disregarded; second, all ESTs were excluded. Application of these criteria revealed 199 genes of which 13 where represented by duplicate probe sets. Hence, a total of 186 genes were significantly altered in response to LANA expression (Fig. 2C). We confirmed the Affymetrix profile for 8 randomly selected genes by real time RT-PCR. Although the extent of up- or down-regulation for each sample differed between the assays, overall trends of gene expression patterns were confirmed (Tables I and II). As additional quality control, array-based profiling on two samples was performed twice. Using 2-fold change as single criteria revealed less than 0.06% gene changes between replicates (80 of 12,625); applying the above-mentioned criteria reduced the observed changes to 0.006%. Hierarchical cluster analysis of these 186 genes showed that the majority of expression changes occurred in congruence with the expression kinetics of LANA between 12 and 36 h post-induction (Fig. 2D).Table I186 genes modulated by LANA in BJAB cellTable I186 genes modulated by LANA in BJAB cell* p53 pathway-related genes (7Dittmer D.

High-resolution atomic force microscopy topographs of both cytoplasmic and periplasmic surfaces of LH2 and RC-LH1-PufX (RC, reaction center) complexes were acquired in situ. The LH2 is a nonameric ring inserted into the membrane with the 9-fold axis perpendicular to the plane.

The excitation energy is funneled toward the special pair (P) of bacteriochlorophylls in the reaction center (RC) followed by an electron transfer from P to the ubiquinone (Q) acceptors, QA and QB. After two photoreactions and proton captures, ubiquinol (Q-H2) is formed at the QB site that dissociates from the RC into the membrane. The cytochrome bc1 complex utilizes Q-H2 and oxidized cytochrome c2 as reductant and oxidant, respectively. The net result is a cyclic electron transfer that promotes the formation of a proton gradient across the membrane, which is utilized for ATP synthesis by the F1F0-ATP synthase (for review see Ref. 1Hu X.

However, the structure of the core complex composed of the LH1 and the RC remains undetermined.Over the last two years, the data of core complexes of Rhodospirillum (Rsp.) rubrum (8Jamieson S.J.

Whereas Rsp. rubrum and B. viridis have monomeric core complexes with 16 LH1 subunits arranged around the RC, Rps. palustris has 15 LH1 subunits plus an unknown polypeptide forming a single trans-membrane helix. The closed architecture of the LH1 assembly raised the question of the quinone exchange through the LH1 assembly between the RC and the cytochrome bc1.In this context, the structural analysis of Rhodobacter core complexes is of particular interest, because it is the only species in which a small trans-membrane protein named PufX has been identified as crucial for bacterial growth under anaerobic photosynthetic conditions and for the fast exchange of quinones between the RC and the cytochrome bc1 complex (11Farchaus J.W.

Biochemical studies have shown that PufX-containing core complexes could be isolated from Rhodobacter sphaeroides membranes as dimeric structures with a 1:1 PufX/RC stoichiometry and a decreased number of LH1-associated bacteriochlorophylls per RC (21Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Barz W. Oesterheld D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6834-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PufX induced a specific orientation of the RC in the LH1 ring as well as the formation of a long range order of LH1-RC core complexes (22Frese R.N. Olsen J.D. Branvall R. Westerhuis W.H. Hunter C.N. van Grondelle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5197-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been proposed that PufX containing core complexes of R. sphaeroides are associated in supercomplexes, each one comprising two RCs, one cytochrome bc1 and one cytochrome c2 (23Joliot P. Vermeglio A. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 336-345Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Taking together, PufX is thought to play a key role in the core complex and in the supramolecular organization of the photosynthetic apparatus of Rhodobacter strains.Low-resolution (20–30 Å) negative stain projection maps of native crystalline tubular membranes of LH2-deleted R. sphaeroides have revealed dimeric core complexes with S-shaped LH1 assemblies housing the two RCs (24Jungas C. Ranck J-L. Rigaud J.-L. Joliot P. Vermeglio A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 25Siebert C.A. Qian P. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In both of the negative stain maps, the LH1 assembly of each core covered approximately 75% of a full ellipse corresponding to 12 ± 1 LH1 subunits/core (24Jungas C. Ranck J-L. Rigaud J.-L. Joliot P. Vermeglio A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 25Siebert C.A. Qian P. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To get further information on this particular core complex and to localize the PufX subunit, structural studies of two-dimensional crystals of RC-LH1-PufX core complexes purified from R. sphaeroides have been performed. First, a cryoelectron microscopy projection map revealing the trans-membrane protein portions showed an S-shaped core complex dimer with an ∼30-Å wide protein-free gap in each LH1 assembly (26Scheuring S. Francia F. Busselez J. Melandri B. Rigaud J-L. Lévy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3620-3626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A maximum density was found at the dimer junction, leading the authors to propose a localization of the two PufX proteins at the dimer junction. Second, an analysis of purified complexes by negative stain electron microscopy and AFM study showed monomeric core complexes with closed LH1-PufX rings (25Siebert C.A. Qian P. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The discrepancies between the two studies in the results and corresponding conclusions are most probably due to different sample preparations, i.e. solubilization, purification, and reconstitution. To unambiguously localize the different subunits of Rhodobacter core complexes, the acquisition of data at molecular resolution under close to native conditions, avoiding preparation artifacts, is required. In this context, a very recent AFM analysis of LH2-containing R. sphaeroides native membranes has visualized dimeric core complexes but the resolution was insufficient to analyze their molecular architecture (27Bahatyrova S. Frese R.N. Siebert C.A. Olsen J.D. Van Der Werf K.O. van Grondelle R. Niederman R.A. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N. Nature. 2004; 430: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).Here, we present a structural study by high-resolution AFM of the core complex of R. blasticus, a strain closely related to R. sphaeroides (20Uchino Y. Yokota A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Tsukatani Y. Matsuura K. Masuda S. Shimada K. Hiraishi A. Nagashima K.V.P. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The AFM topographs have been acquired on fused native photosynthetic membranes of R. blasticus. Due to the fusion of membranes in “up” and “down” orientations, the topographs revealed the periplasmic and cytoplasmic surfaces of LH2 and core complexes. The LH2 complexes are nonameric rings inserted with their 9-fold axis perpendicular to the membrane plane. Importantly, we have acquired high-resolution topographs of PufX-containing core complexes in situ. AFM topographs at a 15-Å resolution revealed that core complexes assemble in S-shaped dimeric complexes. Each core complex is composed of a clearly open LH1 assembly with a gap of ∼25-Å width housing one reaction center. The PufX proteins are identified at the dimer center holding the two cores together. Based on our data, we propose a structural model for the subunit organization of the dimeric S-shaped Rhodobacter core complex. This model provides an explanation for the double function of PufX inducing core complex dimerization and indirectly favoring quinol/quinone passage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Culture and Membrane Preparation—R. blasticus (DSM 2131) was photosynthetically grown. Cells were harvested, washed, and broken by two passages through a French pressure cell. Membranes were purified on sucrose gradients and fused by two freeze and thaw cycles for AFM analysis.Atomic Force Microscopy—Mica prepared as described previously (29Schabert F.A. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2394-2403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was freshly cleaved and used as the support. The mica was immediately covered by 40 μl of adsorption buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm KCl, and 20 mm MgCl2. Subsequently, 3 μl of membrane solution were injected into the adsorption buffer drop on the mica surface. After 10 min, the sample was rinsed with 10 volumes of recording buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, and 150 mm KCl. Imaging was performed with a commercial Nanoscope-E contact-mode AFM (from Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a low-noise laser and a 160-μm scanner (J-scanner) using oxide-sharpened Si3N4 cantilevers with a length of 100 μm (k = 0.09 Newton/m; Olympus Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). For high-resolution imaging, minimal loading forces of ∼100 picoNewton were applied. The piezo precision was determined on protein two-dimensional crystals at scan ranges between 100 and 300 nm, and errors in x- and y-dimensions smaller than 2% were found.Image Analysis—Averages were calculated after the alignment of handpicked particles from trace and retrace images acquired at different magnifications using the Xmipp single particle analysis program package: LH2 cytoplasmic surface, n = 388; LH2 periplasmic surface, n = 235; and the core complex cytoplasmic surface, n = 51. The spectral signal-to-noise ration resolution criterion was used to evaluate the average resolution (30Unser M. Trus B.L. Frank J. Steven A.L. Ultramicroscopy. 1989; 30: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Unser M. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).RESULTSFusion of Chromatophores of R. blasticus—Purified native photosynthetic chromatophores of R. blasticus are uniformly small in size with a diameter of ∼50 nm as determined by electron microscopy (EM). These membranes are too small for AFM analysis. We fused the small vesicles by freeze-thawing cycles (see “Experimental Procedures”). This led to the formation of vesicular membranes with sizes of up to 1 μm amenable to AFM analysis (Fig. 1).High-resolution Topographs of Fused Native Membranes of R. blasticus—A topograph on a fused vesicle is shown in Fig. 1. Although the fused membranes are not completely flat, we have been able to acquire high-resolution topographs allowing the identification of the different components within the membrane. Two types of complexes can be visualized and identified by comparison with previous AFM, EM, and x-ray data of LH2 and LH1-RC-PufX complexes. Small rings at ∼50 Å in diameter with no central density are LH2 complexes, and large S-shaped complexes of ∼10 × ∼20 nm in size encircling protruding central proteins are dimeric RC-LH1-PufX complexes. For both complexes, two surfaces with different heights and appearances were observed. These differences in the protrusion heights of the two surfaces of LH2 and of core complexes have already been reported and attributed to their sidedness. For LH2, the weakly and the strongly protruding surfaces represent the cytoplasmic and the periplasmic surfaces, respectively (32Scheuring S. Reiss-Husson F. Engel A. Rigaud J-L. Ranck J.-L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Lévy D. Breyton C. Robert B. Rigaud J-L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For the core complex, the strongly protruding LH1 housed a central protruding topography corresponding to the H subunit and representing the cytoplasmic surface (34Fotiadis D. Qian P. Philippsen A. Bullough P.A. Engel A. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2063-2068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because in the native membrane both LH2 and core complexes have the same orientation, the existence of two differently protruding surfaces of the two types of complexes can only be interpreted assuming that native chromatophores have fused in up and down orientations during the freeze-thaw process.Although the up and down membrane fusion precludes a detailed interpretation of the position and association of the photosynthetic complexes in the native membrane, regions corresponding to one orientation show that the complexes are in physical contact with neighboring complexes. The distance between the LH2s (Fig. 1, top left) are similar to LH2-LH2 distances found in two-dimensional crystals with a hexagonal lattice (32Scheuring S. Reiss-Husson F. Engel A. Rigaud J-L. Ranck J.-L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, many LH2 rings are in direct contact with the PufX-containing core complexes, facilitating the transfer of excitation energy from LH2 to LH1 and hence to the RC. Such physical contact among the different photosynthetic complexes, as recently reported by AFM in other native membranes (27Bahatyrova S. Frese R.N. Siebert C.A. Olsen J.D. Van Der Werf K.O. van Grondelle R. Niederman R.A. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N. Nature. 2004; 430: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 35Scheuring S. Sturgis J.N. Prima V. Bernadac A. Lévy D. Rigaud J-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11293-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), would represent the basic requirement for the efficient harvesting, transmission, and trapping of light energy in photosynthetic bacteria. The arrangement does ensure the absence of single isolated complexes unconnected from the light-harvesting system. A LH2 complex lacking physical contact to other LH2 or LH1 complexes is not functional, i.e. its excitation energy upon photon capture will be lost.On the other hand, the fusion process, which leads to membranes with complexes in up and down orientations, turns into an important advantage because it allows the analysis of both the cytoplasmic and the periplasmic surfaces of the different components by AFM (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). Indeed, the strongly protruding H-subunit of the RC on the cytoplasmic face makes the acquisition of highly resolved information regarding the LH1 arrangement impossible (27Bahatyrova S. Frese R.N. Siebert C.A. Olsen J.D. Van Der Werf K.O. van Grondelle R. Niederman R.A. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N. Nature. 2004; 430: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Only high-resolution imaging of the periplasmic surface of the core complexes allowed us to determine the PufX localization and delineate the presence of a ∼25-Å gap within the LH1 topography.Fig. 2Analysis of the cytoplasmic and the periplasmic surfaces of R. blasticus LH2.A, raw data topograph with three outlines of cytoplasmic LH2 surfaces.

Differences in the protrusion heights of the two surfaces of LH2 have already been reported, and their sidedness assignment has been established (32Scheuring S. Reiss-Husson F. Engel A. Rigaud J-L.

In the case of R. blasticus, the cytoplasmic surface protrudes weakly by 6 ± 1 Å (n = 20) and has a top ring diameter of 55 Å (Fig. 2, A and C, left), whereas the periplasmic surface of the LH2 complex protrudes strongly by 17 ± 3 Å (n = 20) and has a top ring diameter of 45 Å (Fig. 2, B and C, right). The averaging of the complexes using reference-free alignment allowed us to determine the imaging resolution to 15 Å (30Unser M. Trus B.L. Frank J. Steven A.L.

Rotational power spectrum analysis of the complexes indicated a nonameric assembly of the LH2 complexes from R. blasticus.Different types of peripheral LH2 antenna complexes have been isolated from various species of purple bacteria, and their structures have been analyzed.

In addition, electron crystallography and AFM data in both cases at a resolution sufficient to at least resolve the number of α/β-heterodimer subunits were also acquired on two-dimensional crystals of LH2s from Rhodovulum sulfidophilum, R. sphaeroides, and Rubrivivax gelatinosus, all exhibiting a nonameric organization (32Scheuring S.

For R. sphaeroides LH2, a tilted membrane insertion of ∼6° was measured in two-dimensional crystals (33Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Lévy D. Breyton C. Robert B. Rigaud J-L. J. Mol.

Biol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). We cannot confirm such a tilt of the LH2 complexes in the noncrystalline native membrane R. blasticus.The Two Surfaces of the Dimeric Core Complex—The general appearance of the core complex is an S-shaped molecule of ∼10 × ∼20 nm in size, in agreement with our previous EM studies of dimeric core complexes of R. sphaeroides in native crystalline tubes and in two-dimensional crystals of purified proteins (24Jungas C.

Because of the chromatophore fusion process, two types of core complex topographies corresponding to its two surfaces were found: 1) one weaker protruding (7 Å) S-shaped and 2) the other stronger protruding (15 Å) Z-shaped. The sidedness assignment of the core complex has been established on the core complex of Rsp. rubrum where the strongly protruding LH1 housed the RC, exposing its H-subunit on the cytoplasmic side, and the weakly protruding LH1 surrounded the periplasmic surface of the RC, exhibiting the flat surfaces of the L- and M-subunits (34Fotiadis D.

Indeed, the H-subunit, characteristic for the cytoplasmic side, can be scratched away by the AFM tip in contact mode, revealing the underlying L- and M-subunits (25Siebert C.A. Qian P. Fotiadis D.

In agreement, the weakly protruding S-shaped dimeric core complex exposes a weakly protruding RC and hence corresponds to the periplasmic surface. On the other hand, the strongly protruding LH1 is rather Z-shaped and houses a stronger protruding RC topography on the cytoplasmic surface.The Periplasmic Surface of the Dimeric Core Complex—We have analyzed individual dimeric LH1-RC-PufX core complexes (Fig. 3, A and B). High-resolution raw data topographs of the periplasmic face are shown in the left panel, and the corresponding 2-fold symmetrized complexes are shown in the right panel. The LH1-PufX assembly forms a continuous S with a height of 7 ± 1 Å (n = 20) and housing two RCs. As revealed by single molecule imaging, both RCs have one unique and identical orientation in the LH1 assembly, i.e. the same orientation with respect to the dimer center (Fig. 3B, arrows). Consistently, the major protrusions of the RCs are located at the same positions in both the raw data topographies (Fig. 3, A and B, left panel) and the 2-fold symmetrized complexes (Fig. 3, A and B, right panel). Averaging enhances the signal to noise ratio and allows to compute the topography resolution to 1"

GAA is synthesized as a 110-kDa precursor containing N-linked carbohydrates modified with mannose 6-phosphate groups. Following trafficking to the lysosome, presumably via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, the 110-kDa precursor undergoes a series of complex proteolytic and N-glycan processing events, yielding major species of 76 and 70 kDa. During a detailed characterization of human placental and recombinant human GAA, we found that the peptides released during proteolytic processing remained tightly associated with the major species. The 76-kDa form (amino acids (aa) 122–782) of GAA is associated with peptides of 3.9 kDa (aa 78–113) and 19.4 kDa (aa 792–952). The 70-kDa form (aa 204–782) contains the 3.9- and 19.4-kDa peptide species as well as a 10.3-kDa species (aa 122–199). A similar set of proteolytic fragments has been identified in hamster GAA, suggesting that the multicomponent character is a general phenomenon. Rabbit anti-peptide antibodies have been generated against sequences in the proteolytic fragments and used to demonstrate the time course of uptake and processing of the recombinant GAA precursor in Pompe's disease fibroblasts. The results indicate that the observed fragments are produced intracellularly in the lysosome and not as a result of nonspecific proteolysis during purification. These data demonstrate that the mature forms of GAA characterized by polypeptides of 76 or 70 kDa are in fact larger molecular mass multicomponent enzyme complexes.

The cDNA for GAA encodes a protein of 952 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 105 kDa (1Hoefsloot L. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Kroos M.A. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J. Oostra B.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized precursor has an amino-terminal signal peptide for co-translational transport into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is N-glycosylated at seven glycosylation sites, resulting in a glycosylated precursor with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa. The intracellular processing of GAA has been investigated previously (2Hasilik A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wisselaar H.A.

It was proposed that, after transport through the Golgi complex and targeting to the endosome/lysosome, the 110-kDa precursor is proteolytically processed at the amino terminus, resulting in a 95-kDa intermediate with a sequence beginning at amino acid 122. Prior to this study, the 95-kDa intermediate was proposed to be proteolytically processed to a 76-kDa form, which was believed to occur between amino acids 816 and 881 (3Wisselaar H.A. Kroos M.A. Hermans M.M. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2223-2231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 76-kDa form is then proteolytically processed at the amino terminus at amino acid 204 to give the 70-kDa mature form (3Wisselaar H.A. Kroos M.A. Hermans M.M. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J. J. Biol.

The identities of the proteases involved in the maturation of GAA have never been established. GAA has been purified from many different tissues such as bovine testis (4Reuser A.J.

The predominant species observed are the 76- and 70-kDa mature forms. The fate of the cleaved fragments is unknown. Several reports have noted the presence of small polypeptides in highly purified preparations of the 76- and 70-kDa forms (2Hasilik A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol.

J. 1989; 264: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing appears to be required for optimal activity toward the natural substrate glycogen. There is a 7–10-fold increase in the affinity of the 76/70-kDa species for glycogen compared with the 110-kDa precursor (3Wisselaar H.A. Kroos M.A. Hermans M.M. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J. J. Biol.

GAA is targeted to the lysosomes by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, but analysis of the carbohydrate chains from purified 76/70-kDa GAA from human placenta revealed the absence of mannose 6-phosphate and additional carbohydrate processing (18Mutsaers J.H.G.M.

A deficiency of acid α-glucosidase causes Pompe's disease, which results in the accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes. Pompe's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that varies from a fatal infantile form to a more slowly debilitating adult-onset form (reviewed in Ref. 19.Hirschorn, R., and Reuser, A. J.

Several reports have demonstrated that enzyme replacement therapy using the 110-kDa precursor form of GAA degrades lysosomal glycogen in cultured Pompe's disease fibroblasts and GAA knockout mice (2Hasilik A.

Although the 110-kDa form of GAA has been administered therapeutically, it is the mature forms that are found in the lysosome and that are most active toward the glycogen substrate. In this study, we demonstrate that proteolytically processed GAA purified from human placenta consists of four different peptides processed from a single chain precursor. We demonstrate that the recombinant 110-kDa GAA precursor is internalized by Pompe's disease fibroblasts via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and undergoes proteolytic cleavage during which several of the cleaved fragments remain associated. Concanavalin A, DEAE-Sepharose FF, and Superdex 200 prep grade were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. α-Methyl glucoside, benzamidine, methionine sulfoximine, and 4-methylumbelliferyl α-d-glucoside were obtained from Sigma. Other chemicals were reagent grade or better and were from standard suppliers. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were obtained from Invitrogen. Antibodies were made by Washington Biotechnology (Baltimore, MD). Roller bottles were obtained from Corning. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from JRH Biosciences. Dialyzed phosphate-buffered saline was obtained from Hyclone Laboratories. Acid α-glucosidase was assayed fluorometrically in a microtiter plate using 4-methylumbelliferyl α-d-glucoside as a substrate in 25 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.8) (10Oude Elferink R.P.

Protein concentration was estimated by absorbance at 280 nm assuming E1% = 10 or using the micro BCA assay (Pierce) standardized with bovine serum albumin (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T.

Reduced and nonreduced samples and molecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences) were applied to a 4–20 or 10% Tris/glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 1.5 h, and proteins were visualized with either Coomassie Blue or silver stain (21Blum H. Beier H. Gross H. Electrophoresis. 1987; : 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). Buffer A contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.25% Triton X-100. Buffer B contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 500 mm NaCl. Buffer C contained 20 mm BisTris-HCl (pH 5.5). Buffer D contained 20 mm BisTris-HCl (pH 5.5) and 500 mm NaCl. Buffer E contained 3 m (NH4)2SO4 and 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5). Buffer F contained 1 m (NH4)2SO4 and 25 mm Tris (pH 6.5). Buffer G contained 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.5) and 20 mm NaCl.

Buffer J contained 20 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.5). CHO-K1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The Pompe's disease fibroblast cell line GM00248 was obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). This cell line is homozygous for the common African-American R854X mutation. Step 1: Harvesting Cells and Cell Lysis—CHO-K1 cells were expanded to 500 1700-cm2 roller bottles in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/1× glutamine synthetase supplement, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 25 μm methionine sulfoximine, and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Each bottle was rinsed with 40 ml of dialyzed phosphate-buffered saline and then rolled for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 40 ml of buffer A. The cell lysate was clarified with a 10-inch 0.2-μm Opticap filter (Millipore Corp.) and stored at –20 °C. Step 2: Concanavalin A—The clarified cell lysate was adjusted to 1 mm MnCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 and applied to a concanavalin A column (5.0 × 18 cm) equilibrated with buffer B at 50 ml/min. The column was washed with ∼7 column volumes of buffer B and step-eluted with buffer B containing 0.25 m α-methyl glucoside. Three 1-liter fractions were collected and pooled. Step 3: Affinity Chromatography on Superdex 200—GAA is retarded because of its affinity for the dextran backbone of the Superdex matrix. Solid (NH4)2SO4 (0.39 g/ml) was added to the concanavalin A eluate with stirring at 4 °C. The suspension was stirred overnight at 4 °C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 38,400 × g for 30 min in a JLA 16.250 rotor and then dissolved in a final volume of 30 ml of buffer C. The sample was applied to a Superdex 200 column (5 × 90 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer D at 10 ml/min. Fractions of 40 ml were collected and assayed for acid α-glucosidase activity and protein. Step 4: DEAE-Sepharose FF—Two activity peaks eluted from the Superdex 200 column. The first activity peak contained 25% of the recovered activity. Because no additional purity was gained in the first activity peak, we could not isolate GAA from that peak. However, the second activity peak to elute, which contained 75% of the recovered activity, was significantly enriched for GAA. The second peak was pooled and diluted with 2 volumes of buffer C and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer C at 10 ml/min. After washing with 5 column volumes, the column was developed with a 30-column volume gradient from 0.0 to 0.3 m NaCl in buffer C. Fractions of 10 ml were collected and assayed for acid α-glucosidase activity and protein. Step 5: Reverse-phase Chromatography—Reverse-phase narrow bore HPLC was performed using a Michrom Bioresources ultra-fast micro protein analyzer. An aliquot (∼50 μg) of Chinese hamster acid α-glucosidase (DEAE fraction) was diluted 1:1 with “magic mixture” denaturant (4.0 m guanidine hydrochloride, 4.0 m urea, 7.5% acetonitrile, 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.2% Zwittergent ZC-8 (Calbiochem)) (4Reuser A.J. Kroos M.A. Ponne N.J. Wolterman R.A. Loonen M.C. Busch H.F. Visser W.J. Bolhuis P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 155: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and applied to a 2.1 × 50-mm PLRP-S reverse-phase HPLC column (4000-Å pore size, 8-μm particle size; Michrom Bioresources, Inc.) pre-equilibrated at 54 °C with 98% eluent A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.03% Zwittergent ZC-8) and 2% eluent B (90% acetonitrile, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.03% Zwittergent ZC-8). The column was rapidly stepped to 20% eluent B and developed at 0.18 ml/min with a 7.2-ml linear gradient from 20 to 95% eluent B. Fractions of ∼0.18 ml were collected. The purification of human placental acid α-glucosidase was based on previously reported methods (14Martiniuk F. Honig J. Hirschorn R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 231: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Mutsaers J.H.G.M. Halbeek H.V. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Tager J.M. Reuser A.J.J. Kroos M.A. Galjaard H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Step 1: Homogenization of Tissue—Three human placentas were diced after the connective tissue had been removed and added to a Waring blender. An equal weight of ice-cold 25 mm NaCl was added, and the tissue was homogenized for 3 min. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 38,400 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was clarified with a 4-inch 0.22-μm Opticap filter (Millipore Corp.). Step 2: Concanavalin A—The clarified supernatant was adjusted to 1 mm MnCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 and applied to a concanavalin A column (2.6 × 20 cm) equilibrated with buffer B at 9 ml/min. The column was washed with ∼10 column volumes of buffer B and step-eluted with buffer B containing 0.25 m α-methyl glucoside. Three 0.25-liter fractions were collected and pooled. Step 3: Phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF—The concanavalin A eluate was adjusted to 1 m (NH4)2SO4 with buffer E and applied to a phenylSepharose 6 FF column (1.6 × 20 cm) equilibrated with buffer F at 6.5 ml/min. After washing the column with 5 column volumes of buffer F, the column was washed with buffer F containing 0.25 m (NH4)2SO4. Placental GAA was eluted with a 5-column volume gradient from 0.25 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer F. Fractions of 15 ml were collected and assayed for acid α-glucosidase activity and protein. Step 4: Affinity Chromatography on Superdex 200—Peak fractions from the phenyl-Sepharose elution were concentrated to 10 ml in a 50-ml stirred ultrafiltration cell (Amicon, Inc.) using a polyethersulfone membrane (nominal molecular weight limit of 30,000; Millipore Corp.). The sample was then applied to a Superdex 200 column (2.6 × 65 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer G at 2.5 ml/min. Fractions of 6 ml were collected and assayed for acid α-glucosidase activity and protein. Step 5: Superose 6—A peak fraction from the Superdex 200 elution was applied to a Superose 6 column (10 × 30 cm) equilibrated with buffer G at 2 ml/min. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and assayed for acid α-glucosidase activity and protein. The rhGAA precursor and intermediate were produced using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with a vector containing a full-length human GAA cDNA following the method described previously (22Qiu H. Edmunds T. Baker-Malcolm J. Karey K.P. Estes S. Schwarz C. Hughes H. Van Patten S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32744-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). rhGAA was purified from the CHO-conditioned medium as follows. The CHO cell culture harvest was clarified by sequential direct flow filtration using a polyethersulfone pre-filter, followed by a Whatman Polycap 75TC 0.2-μm PES membrane filter. The clarified harvest was concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration with a 30-kDa spiral wound ultrafiltration membrane (S10Y30, Millipore Corp.). The concentrate was diafiltered into 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The diafiltered harvest was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with diafiltration buffer at 2.5 mg of rhGAA/ml of resin. The column was washed with equilibration buffer, followed by 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), eluting some of the mature forms of GAA. The enriched precursor form of rhGAA was eluted with 25 mm sodium phosphate and 0.17 m sodium chloride (pH 7.0). The Q-Sepharose eluate was adjusted to 0.75 m ammonium sulfate and loaded onto a butyl-Toyopearl 650C column equilibrated with 25 mm sodium phosphate and 0.75 m ammonium sulfate (pH 6.5) at 8 mg of GAA/ml of resin. The column was washed with equilibration buffer, and the rhGAA protein was eluted with 15 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). A detailed description of the preparation of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase will be reported elsewhere. 2M. Kudo and W. M. Canfield, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, a production cell line secreting recombinant soluble human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was generated by transfection of CHO cells with a “double gene” expression vector in pEE14.1/pEE6.1 (Lonza Biologics, Portsmouth, NH) containing modified human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-subunit sequences and the native γ-subunit sequence. The α/β-subunit cDNA contained four modifications of the native sequence. First, the amino-terminal signal anchor sequence was replaced with a signal peptide derived from the mouse immunoglobulin κ light chain. Second, the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane sequence was deleted by truncation following amino acid 1209. Third, the sequence at the α/β-cleavage site (amino acids 924–929) was replaced with the sequence RARYKR, introducing a recognition site for the processing enzyme furin. Fourth, a 12-amino acid epitope sequence recognized by monoclonal antibody HPC4 was added following the signal peptide cleavage site. The γ-subunit sequence was unmodified from the native sequence. To prepare recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, the production cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in roller bottles incubated at 37 °C in a5%CO2 atmosphere. Conditioned medium was chromatographed on a column of monoclonal antibody HPC4 immobilized at 5 mg/ml on NHS-activated Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences). Soluble Glc-NAc-phosphotransferase was eluted with 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 5 mm EGTA and 15 mm MgCl2. Following elution and buffer exchange into 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm NaAc (pH 6.5) containing 15 mm MgCl2, GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was stored at –80 °C until used. The purified GlcNAc-phosphotransferase had a specific activity of ∼10 μmol/mg/h. A detailed description has been published (32.Canfield, W. M. (November 4, 2003) U. S. Patent 6,642,038Google Scholar). A detailed method for the production of HP-rhGAA will be described elsewhere. 2M. Kudo and W. M. Canfield, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, rhGAA was expressed in CHO cells grown in the presence of kifunensine at 1 mg/liter. Kifunensine selectively inhibits α-mannosidase I and causes the accumulation of Man7–9-GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides on glycoproteins. A preparation containing the 110-, 95-, and 76-kDa forms was purified from conditioned medium, and the glycans containing terminal mannose were phosphorylated by treatment with GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. The transfer of GlcNAc phosphate to terminal mannoses was performed at a GlcNAc-phosphotransferase to GAA ratio of 1:10 (w/w). UDP-GlcNAc was added to the reaction at 3 mm. The reaction was followed by the addition of 1% (w/w) N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (uncovering enzyme). The uncovering enzyme removes the GlcNAc to give mannose 6-phosphate. The 95/76-kDa intermediates were separated from the 110-kDa precursor by Superdex 200 affinity chromatography. Samples were boiled in 4× sample buffer (NuPAGE, Invitrogen), applied to a 4–20% Tris/glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide precast gel (Novex, Invitrogen), and run at 180 V for ∼60 min in 25 mm Tris and 0.2 m glycine. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Pierce) with a semidry blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) in buffer H at 20 V for 60 min. The membrane was blocked in 3% nonfat dry milk in buffer I for 30 min and then incubated with the designated antibody at 1 μg/ml in 3% milk in buffer I for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed five times with buffer I, and then the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-goat, or anti-rabbit secondary antibody was applied at 1 μg/ml in 3% nonfat dry milk in buffer I for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed four times with buffer I and then four times with buffer I without Tween 20. Acid α-glucosidase was visualized with the SuperSignal detection kit (Pierce). Goat polyclonal antibody to human GAA was produced by Ferrell Farms (McLoud, OK). Goats were immunized with highly purified placental GAA that had been mixed with Freund's adjuvant. Rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies to GAA were produced by Washington Biotechnology. Rabbits were immunized with synthesized peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The sequence for each peptide was derived from sequence within each GAA fragment as follows: anti-GAA-(57–74) (QQGASRPGPRDAQAHPGR), anti-GAA-(78–94) (VPTQCDVPPNSRFDCAP), and anti-GAA-(183–200) (IKDPANRRYEVPLETPRV). Monoclonal antibody to GAA (GAA1) was prepared by immunizing mice with highly purified placental GAA that had been mixed with Freund's adjuvant. Isolation of the GAA1 hybridoma was performed following standard procedures. Fifty μg of protein samples was denatured and reduced with 150 μl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5) and 2.5 μlof2 m dithiothreitol. The samples were overlaid with nitrogen and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h in darkness. After cooling, 12.5 μl of 10% 4-vinylpyridine, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5) was added to the protein samples. The samples were then overlaid with nitrogen and incubated at room temperature for 2 h in darkness. The reaction was quenched with 12.5 μl of 2 m dithiothreitol. After reduction and alkylation, the samples were dialyzed overnight with a Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Mr 10,000 cutoff; Pierce) against 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5). Trypsin was added to the protein sample at a ratio of 1:50 (w/w). After an 18-h incubation at 37 °C, the digestion was quenched with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and stored at –20 °C for future analysis. Protein samples were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with saturated sinapinic acid matrix solution (50% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and H2O and 50% acetonitrile), and 1 μl of the mixture was applied to the sample target. The data were acquired in positive linear mode on a Voyager DE PRO MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Singly and doubly charged molecular ions of bovine serum albumin (Sigma) were used to calibrate for the mass range of 20–140 kDa. The singly charged molecular ions of insulin and apomyoglobin from Calibration Mixture 3 (Applied Biosystems) were used to calibrate for the mass range of 2–20 kDa. Capillary LC/MS was performed on a QSTAR QQ-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) interfaced with an Ultimate capillary LC system (LC Packings). Protein separations were performed on a Vydac C4 reverse-phase column (320 μm ×50 cm; Microtech Scientific) with a mobile phase of 1% formic acid in water (A) and acetonitrile (B). The flow rate was 4 μl/min. The mass spectra were acquired in the positive mode at a range of m/z 800–3000. Protein reduction was performed by adding 1 μl of 10% β-mercaptoethanol to every 10 μl of protein sample. The samples were sonicated for 25 min and heated at 100 °C for 1 min before MS analysis. On-line capillary LC/MS/MS was performed on both Esquire LC (Bruker) and QSTAR QQ-TOF systems. Proteins were separated on a Vydac C18 column (320 μm × 15 cm; Microtech Scientific) using the chromatography conditions described above. On both instruments, the two most intensive peaks with m/z >350 were chosen for on-line MS/MS. Samples of reduced and nonreduced rhGAA and placental GAA were applied to a 4–20 or 6% Tris/glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 1.2 h. The proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane using 10 mm CAPS (pH 11.0). Transfer was performed for 1 h at 100 V. Protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Blue. Fifteen cycles of automated Edman chemistry were performed on protein bands excised from PVDF electroblots. Amino-terminal sequencing was performed with the Model 492 Procise Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using the preprogrammed pulsed-liquid PVDF method. Twenty μg of purified human placental GAA and rhGAA was analyzed by affinity chromatography using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). GAA is retarded because of its affinity for the dextran backbone of the Superdex matrix. The column was"
https://openalex.org/W2059980756,"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2; gelatinase A) is known to degrade a broad range of extracellular matrix components and chemokines, and has important roles in the processes of cell migration, invasion, and involution during development, as well as during tumor growth and metastasis and in inflammation and repair. To better elucidate the roles of this matrix metalloproteinase in the development and progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we used MMP-2-deficient (KO) mice. Surprisingly, we found that MMP-2 KO mice exhibited an earlier onset and more severe disease than did their wild-type (WT) counterparts. WT mice engrafted with MMP-2 KO bone marrow exhibited a similar earlier onset and more severe clinical disease score than WT mice engrafted with WT bone marrow. Lymphocytes derived from MMP-2 KO mice exhibited increased transmigration through endothelial cell monolayers as well as through collagen type IV and laminin-coated BD BIOCOAT inserts, which correlated with a 3-fold increase in expression of MMP-9 and was abrogated by inhibition of MMP activity. We demonstrated a correlation between expression levels of MMP-9 and MT1-MMP expression and suggest a signaling pathway involving tethering of MMP-2 to MT1-MMP as a modulator of MMP-9 expression. Last, we discuss other possible MMP-2-mediated mechanisms which may contribute to the observed phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2149064460,"Following spinal cord injury, there are numerous changes in gene expression that appear to contribute to either neurodegeneration or reparative processes. We utilized high density oligonucleotide microarrays to examine temporal gene profile changes after spinal cord injury in rats with the goal of identifying novel factors involved in neural plasticity. By comparing mRNA changes that were coordinately regulated over time with genes previously implicated in nerve regeneration or plasticity, we found a gene cluster whose members are involved in cell adhesion processes, synaptic plasticity, and/or cytoskeleton remodeling. This group, which included the small GTPase Rab13 and actin-binding protein Coronin 1b, showed significantly increased mRNA expression from 7–28 days after trauma. Overexpression in vitro using PC-12, neuroblastoma, and DRG neurons demonstrated that these genes enhance neurite outgrowth. Moreover, RNAi gene silencing for Coronin 1b or Rab13 in NGF-treated PC-12 cells markedly reduced neurite outgrowth. Coronin 1b and Rab13 proteins were expressed in cultured DRG neurons at the cortical cytoskeleton, and at growth cones along with the pro-plasticity/regeneration protein GAP-43. Finally, Coronin 1b and Rab13 were induced in the injured spinal cord, where they were also co-expressed with GAP-43 in neurons and axons. Modulation of these proteins may provide novel targets for facilitating restorative processes after spinal cord injury.

Modulation of these proteins may provide novel targets for facilitating restorative processes after spinal cord injury. Traumatic injury to the spinal cord induces delayed biochemical responses that affect both cell loss and subsequent repair. Modulation of reparative processes includes factors involved in either facilitating or inhibiting neurite outgrowth, which are often regulated at the gene and protein levels after injury. Collectively, these factors likely determine in part the degree of anatomical and functional recovery after injury. Regeneration-associated proteins (RAGs) appear to play a role in plasticity and regeneration following SCI. 1The abbreviations used are: SCI, spinal cord injury; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; RT, reverse transcription; NGF, nerve growth factor; RNAi, RNA interference; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: SCI, spinal cord injury; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; RT, reverse transcription; NGF, nerve growth factor; RNAi, RNA interference; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein.

In some cases, these factors share common molecular pathways. GAP-43 and CAP-23 bind downstream to the cofactor PI(4,5)P(2), at plasmalemmal rafts, contributing to the regulation of actin and modulating neurite outgrowth in neuronal-like cell lines (11Laux T.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4332-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In other instances, a common downstream effector, such as neurotrophin-dependent intracellular cAMP, may serve to facilitate axonal regeneration by overcoming inhibition from factors such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) (13Cai D.

Microarray technology provides a powerful tool for identifying molecular pathways involved in either endogenous neurotoxicity or regeneration/plasticity after SCI (16Carmel J.B. Galante A.

It allows concurrent analysis of thousands of genes and the identification of clusters of coordinately regulated transcripts sharing similar functions. Previously we reported early changes following spinal cord injury in rats, showing induction of specific cell cycle genes (gadd45a, c-myc, cyclin D1, and cdk4, pcna, cyclin G, Rb, and E2F5) that were closely associated with post-traumatic apoptosis (18Di Giovanni S. Knoblach S.M. Brandoli C. Aden S.A. Hoffman E.P. Faden A.I. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Here, we focused on later time points to identify genes potentially associated with neuronal plasticity and neurite outgrowth after SCI by evaluating temporal gene profiles that were coordinately regulated with expression profiles of known pro-plasticity factors. A stringent temporal correlation analysis of the profiles and subsequent functional classification allowed identification of six genes belonging to a specific gene cluster, which was overexpressed between 7 and 28 days after injury, and whose members are involved in neuronal plasticity, neurite outgrowth, and synaptogenesis. Overexpression of these genes in PC-12, SH-SY5 neuroblastoma cell lines, or DRG neurons in vitro significantly promoted neurite outgrowth. Novel members of this cluster: Coronin 1b and Rab13, were further characterized in vivo, and in vitro, and their role in neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth was studied using RNA interference (RNAi) gene silencing. Based upon these in vitro and in vivo observations, we propose a role for these genes in neuronal plasticity after injury. Mild contusion spinal cord injury was performed in rats, as previously described (18Di Giovanni S. Knoblach S.M. Brandoli C. Aden S.A. Hoffman E.P. Faden A.I. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (275–325 gm) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Injury was induced using a weight drop method (10 g dropped from 17.5 mm). Animals with this injury level show mild motor impairment on the Basso, Beattie, Breshnahan scale, averaging 12 ± 1, 14 ± 1, and 17 ± 1, respectively at 7, 14, and 28 days after injury. Animals were fully anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (67 mg/kg) during the operative procedures, and experiments complied fully with the principles set forth in the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” prepared by the Committee on Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Laboratory Resources, National Research Council (DHEW pub. no. (NIH) 85-23, 2985). A 1-cm section of the spinal cord, centered at T-9, was dissected, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Spinal cords were collected from 4 injured and 2 sham-operated rats (receiving only laminectomy) for each time point (4 h, 24 h, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days (3 animals) and two naïve controls (rats that did not undergo any surgical procedure) for a total of 31 animals. Seven micrograms of total RNA was used for complementary DNA (cDNA) and biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA) synthesis. Expression profiling analysis was performed using the Affymetrix rat U34 A, B, and C arrays. Each genechip was used for a single hybridization with RNA isolated from one spinal cord sample from a single animal. Total number of samples was 31. Expression profiling was performed as described previously (18Di Giovanni S. Knoblach S.M. Brandoli C. Aden S.A. Hoffman E.P. Faden A.I. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was extracted from each cord sample individually using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and processed for chip hybridization using the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix). We employed stringent quality control methods as previously published and detailed on our website: (pepr.cnmcresearch.org/browse.do). Expression profiles utilized for analysis fulfilled all quality control measures as detailed in previous reports (18Di Giovanni S. Knoblach S.M. Brandoli C. Aden S.A. Hoffman E.P. Faden A.I. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 21Di Giovanni S. Molon A. Broccolini A. Melcon G. Mirabella M. Hoffman E.P. Servidei S. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 5: 195-206Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We used two normalization processes: one for chip-chip comparisons (scaling factors), and one for temporal analysis (normalization to the average of the naïve signal intensities for each gene). The scaling factors determinations were done using default Affymetrix algorithms (MAS 5) with a target intensity of chip sector fluorescence to 800. Both pre-amplification (s1) and post-amplification with streptavidin/phycoerythrin (s2) scans were done, and the scans compared by scatter plots and correlation coefficients. Those probe sets showing evidence of saturation of the PMT in s2 were flagged. We have recently shown that use of Affymetrix MAS 5.0 signal intensity values, together with a “present call” noise filter achieves an excellent signal/noise balance relative to other probe set analysis methods (dchip, RMA) (39Seo J. Bakay M. Chen Y.W. Hilmer S. Shneiderman B. Hoffman E.P. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Data analyses were limited to probe sets that showed one or more “present” (P “calls”) in the 79 gene chip profiles in our complete dataset. Experiment normalization was performed by normalizing gene chips from injured and sham controls to the mean of the two chips from naïve animals considered as the baseline gene expression level. Normalized data were then compared for differential gene expression analysis across time points between sham and injured groups. Genes that showed a Welch analysis of variance t test p value <0.05 between sham and injured groups for at least one time point were retained for further analysis. Initial data analysis also included a fold change filter of >1.5 (50% difference) increase or decrease relative to sham operated animals (Affymetrix MAS 5.0). While a p value of <0.05 alone would give many false positives, the combination of present call filters, fold change thresholds, and p values thresholds, eliminates most false positives that are obtained with only p < 0.05. We studied selected transcripts by real time PCR using cDNAs extracted from cords of rats subject to spinal cord trauma and sham controls in parallel experiments, at the time point 14 days, to validate our microarrays findings. Fluorophore-labeled LUX primers (forward) and their unlabeled counterparts (reverse) were provided by Invitrogen. LUX primers were designed matching the probe sets sequences for Ninjurin, Rap1b, Rab13, and Coronin 1b and all primers were designed using the software called LUX Designer (Invitrogen, www.invitrogen.com/lux). Each primer was chosen matching the target probe set sequence for the gene of interest. More in detail, primer sequences were: Ninjurin (forward: caccttTCCTGTTCACAGCCCAAGG5G), reverse: (TCTTCATGGCTTTGCATCCAG), Rab13 (forward: cacactgAGACAAGTGCCAAATCCAGTG5G), (reverse: TCAGTGCTTGAGGGCTTGCT), Rap1b (forward: cacgaCTCCCTTGCTTGCTCG5G), (reverse: TTCCCACATTCACATCCACA), and Coronin 1b (forward: caccaTAGAGGACTGCACTGTCATGG5G), (reverse: GCACATTTCGGGCTGTGG). We performed multiplex PCR using each experimental gene with the housekeeping gene GAPDH. For each sample, as previously detailed, 50-μl PCR contained 2 μl of cDNA, 10 μm of each gene-specific primer (two pairs for multiplex PCR) and 1× Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen). Reactions containing fluorogenic LUX primers included 1× SuperMix and were incubated at 25 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 2 min, and then cycled (45×) using 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and reactions were incubated at 40 °C for 1 min and then ramped to 95 °C over a period of 19 min followed by incubation at 25 °C for 2 min (ramp for melting curve analysis). Reactions were conducted in a 96-well spectrofluorometric thermal cycler (ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence detector system, Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence was monitored during every PCR cycle at the annealing or extension step and during the post-PCR temperature ramp. Fold changes were calculated following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cords used for immunoblotting included samples from three injured and two sham spinal cords at the time points 7 and 14 days after injury. For E14 DRGs, 500–600 DRG were isolated for each time point, and cultured in six well plates. Frozen tissues were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% SDS, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), and aprotinin (5 μg/ml). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. A portion of the lysate (30–50 μg of protein) was then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading and transfer of samples and was then probed with specific antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). β-Actin protein abundance was used as control for gel loading and transfer. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-Coronin 1b (1:1000, custom antibody from Bethyl Laboratories), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab13 (1:1000, custom antibody from Bethyl Laboratories). Omission of the primary antibodies or their replacement by preimmune sera was used for control experiments. Immunocomplexes were visualized with ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Spinal Cords—12-μm frozen sections from three injured and two sham spinal cords were collected between 0.4 and 0.5 cm below or above the injury site epicenter, as previously reported (18Di Giovanni S. Knoblach S.M. Brandoli C. Aden S.A. Hoffman E.P. Faden A.I. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Sections were incubated under the same coverslip and processed for immunocytochemistry. They were first dried at room temperature, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in PBS and incubated with 10% normal serum and 0.2% Triton X in PBS (goat or rabbit depending on the secondary antibodies used) for 60 min to mask nonspecific adsorption sites. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with one or more of the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-coronin 1b (1:100, custom antibody from Bethyl Laboratories), and rabbit polyclonal anti-rab13 (1:100, custom antibody from Bethyl Laboratories). Omission of the primary antibodies or their replacement by preimmune sera was used for control experiments. After several rinses in PBS, the sections were incubated with the appropriate rhodamine, Alexa 488-, 568-, or 647-coupled secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit) for 1 h at room temperature and washed in PBS before mounting the slides with aqueous medium. Double labeling was also performed combining mouse monoclonal anti-rat neuN (1:100, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-rat β-III tubulin (1:200, Promega, Madison, WI), or mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (1:200, Chemicon); mouse monoclonal anti-rat myelin/oligodendrocyte O4 (1:100, US Biological); mouse anti-rat CD11b (1:100, Serotec, Oxford, UK), and mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal anti-GAP-43 (1:200, Chemicon), with each of the above antibodies. Immunofluorescence was detected using confocal microscopy (Zeiss Inc.). Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) Neurons—E14 dorsal root ganglia cells cultured in Neurobasal medium onto glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm in diameter) coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin (Biomedical Technologies Inc.) in 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well, were fixed after 3, 5, 7, 9, and 14 days in culture, and processed for immuncytochemistry as described above for spinal cord tissue. Primary antibodies used included Coronin 1b, and Rab13, (same dilutions as above). Each one of them was combined in double immunostaining experiments with either mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal GAP-43 or with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin for detection of F-actin (Molecular Probes). The same secondary antibodies used for spinal cord sections were employed in these experiments. Immunofluorescence was detected using deconvolution microscopy (Zeiss Inc.). Ninjurin, Rab13, Rap1b, Synaptogyrin, Synaptotagmin, and Coronin 1b, full-length cDNA expression constructs in pCMV SPORT6 were purchased from Invitrogen Inc. (respectively, IMAGE LLAM clones 2596463; 3908502; 6150381; 5173992; and GATEWAY Human clones CSODG004YH12; CSODD003YH09). PC-12 and SH-SY5 neuroblastoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Embryonic day 14 DRG neurons were removed and dissociated as previously described (40Fedoroff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. 3rd Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 95-100Google Scholar). Briefly, E14 embryos were collected and placed in cold L-15 medium, the head and tail removed, and skin overlaying the spinal cord cut. The spinal cord with DRG attached was removed using fine curved forceps, the ganglia isolated, and excess meninges trimmed. Ganglia were suspended in L-15 medium containing 0.25% trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, fetal bovine serum was added to 10% final concentration, washed, then dissociated by titration with a fire-polished pipette. DRG neurons were cultured in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with B-27, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units penicillin-streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml of NT3. Some cultures were treated with 1 × 10–5 flurodeoxyuridine, 1 × 10–5 uridine 24 h after plating for 2 days to reduce non-neuronal cells. Cells were transfected after 7 days in culture. For transfection, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm in diameter) coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin (Biomedical Technologies Inc.) in 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 72 h. Transfection experiments were performed using the NeuroPORTER transfection kit (Sigma) for DRGs, and using Lipofectamine 2000 for PC-12 and SH-SY5 cells (Invitrogen). Recombinant plasmid DNA encoding GFP was included in transfections to monitor transfected cells. Cells were stained with both β-III tubulin and GAP-43 (Chemicon) antibodies to identify both cell body and processes of neurons undergoing plasticity. Neurite outgrowth was evaluated measuring the neurite length of the longest neurite per cell counting only processes positive for GFP, β-III tubulin, and GAP-43 for DRGs, and measuring the number of PC-12 and SH-SY5 cells with neurites at least 2 times the length cell body. Measurements were conducted in three different experiments by two different operators. Cells were viewed using a CCD camera and analyzed with image analysis software AxioVision 3.1 (Zeiss). Complementary hairpin oligonucleotides were designed using the “siRNA Converter” Internet tool (Ambion), annealed, and cloned between BamHI and HindIII restriction sites in pSilencer™ 3.1-H1/neo (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows (sense and antisense, respectively): rat Coronin 1b 5′-GATCCCAAGTTGTGCGGCAGAGCAATTCAAGAGATTGCTCTGCCGCACAACTTTTTTTTGGAAA A-3′ and 5′-GCTTTTCCAAAAAAAAGTTGTGCGGCAGAGCAATCTCTTGAATTGCTCTGCCGCACAACTTGG-3′; and rat Rab13 5′-GATCCCGATCCGAACTGTGGAAATATTCAAGAGATATTTCCACAGTTCGGATCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′, and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGATCCGAACTGTGGAAATATCTCTTGAATATTTCCACAGTTCGGATCGG-3′. Oligonucleotides were transfected along with eGFP plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for experimental samples, and with eGFP plus naked DNA for control cells. We also employed scrambled siRNA sequences to control for the specificity of the silencing effect (data not shown, Silencer™ Negative Control, Ambion). Inhibitory effect of RNA interference on expression of Coronin 1b was tested in transiently transfected PC-12 cells during NGF treatment (50 ng/ml) by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining using anti-rat Coronin antibodies (custom antibodies, Bethyl Laboratories). Cells positive for eGFP and negative for Coronin or Rab13 staining were compared with control cells positive for both eGFP and Coronin or Rab13, and were selected for evaluation of neurite outgrowth, measuring the length of the longest neurite per cell as detailed in previous section. Identification of Putative Pro-plasticity Gene Cluster Induced between 7 and 28 Days following SCI—Approximately 24,000 probe sets were examined using Affymetrix high density oligonucleotides arrays (U34 A, B, and C chips) at 4 h, 24 h, 7 days, 14 days, or 28 days after SCI. We applied a present call noise filter (1 in 79 arrays), fold change thresholds (>1.5), and a p value of less than 0.05 as our initial data set for preliminary analysis and pathway identification. This analysis led to further consideration of about 6000 transcripts, of which 5% would be expected to be false positives. Files from all 79 arrays are available from our website, including *.dat, *.cel, and *.txt files (pepr.cnmcresearch.org/browse.do). This website includes an on-line time series query tool of this data set (pepr.cnmcresearch.org/jsp/searchForm.jsp). The spreadsheets showing all genes profiling preliminary analysis criteria are also available on the website. A more complete analysis of the global gene changes has also been previously reported by us (18Di Giovanni S. Knoblach S.M. Brandoli C. Aden S.A. Hoffman E.P. Faden A.I. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Among the significantly altered transcripts, we searched for transcripts previously implicated in neuronal-axonal repair and plasticity after injury. We identified a transcript corresponding to Ninjurin (nerve injury-induced protein), a cell adhesion molecule that is up-regulated after axotomy in neurons and in Schwann cells surrounding the distal nerve segment, and promotes neurite extension of dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro (20Araki T. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1996; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We then used Ninjurin as an “anchor gene” to fish out a cluster of temporally correlated genes that could potentially have a similar function that is involved in neuronal plasticity after SCI. We used the gene array analysis software GeneSpring (as previously detailed, Refs. 18Di Giovanni S. Knoblach S.M. Brandoli C. Aden S.A. Hoffman E.P. Faden A.I. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and 21Di Giovanni S. Molon A. Broccolini A. Melcon G. Mirabella M. Hoffman E.P. Servidei S. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 5: 195-206Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that allows identification of gene profiles with similar temporal regulation, and identified a cluster of temporally correlated genes (correlation coefficient, R2 = 0.98) overexpressed between 7 and 28 days after injury, that included 20 transcripts. Functional classification showed that this group of genes was variably associated with immune response, cell adhesion, axon migration, polarity, growth, guidance, dendrite elaboration, plasticity, and synapse formation (Table I). To further narrow the field to identify a more specific group of temporally correlated transcripts, we performed a more stringent correlation analysis using both Standard and Pearson correlation (R2 = 0.99), which identified five genes other than Ninjurin: Coronin 1b, Rab13, Synaptogyrin, and Synaptotagmin (Fig. 1). Synaptic vesicles associated proteins Synaptotagmin and Synaptogyrin have been localized at the synaptic terminals in several neuronal types and in PC-12 cells, and play a role in synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter release and neurite outgrowth (for review, see Refs. 22Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 23Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 295: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Janz R.

Rap1 is a small GTPase involved in several signal transduction pathways, and is induced by NGF in PC12 cells and is necessary for neurite outgrowth (25Lu L. Anneren C. Reedquist K.A. Bos J.L. Welsh M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Anneren C. Reedquist K.A. Bos J.L. Welsh M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29153-29161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Coronin 1b is an actin-binding protein involved in cytoskeleton remodeling (for review, see Ref. 27de Hostos E.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), Rab13 is another small GTPase, belonging to the rab family of proteins, which plays a role also in cytoskeleton dynamics and vesicle transport (for review, see Ref. 28Tang B.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Analogs of Coronin 1b (cilpin C) and a Rab family member (Rab8) have also been localized at cellular protrusions, and neurite tips in PC-12 and SH-SY5 cells (29Nakamura T. Takeuchi K. Muraoka S. Takezoe H. Takahashi N. Mori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13322-13327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Hattula K. Furuhjelm J. Arffman A. Peranen J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3268-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, based upon their temporal co-regulation with the other members of the cluster, and upon their known or putative biological function, Coronin 1b, and Rab13 appeared to be factors involved in neurite outgrowth and differentiation.Table IComparison of expression levels between sham and injured cords for Ninjurin cluster transcripts induced 14 days after SCIGenBank™Gene nameFold changet-test p value (injured 14 d vs sham 14 d)AI232103Collagen XVIII2.34<0.01AI169104Platelet factor 4 (Pf4)4.22<0.05AI104907Protein degradation (Psme4)2.67<0.01AI0094"
https://openalex.org/W1984996637,"We determined whether the two major structural modifications, i.e. phosphorylation and sulfation of the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1), govern the specificity of the glycosyltransferases responsible for the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide primer. We analyzed the influence of C-2 phosphorylation of Xyl residue on human β1,4-galactosyltransferase 7 (GalT-I), which catalyzes the transfer of Gal onto Xyl, and we evaluated the consequences of C-4/C-6 sulfation of Galβ1–3Gal (Gal2-Gal1) on the activity and specificity of β1,3-glucuronosyltransferase I (GlcAT-I) responsible for the completion of the glycosaminoglycan primer sequence. For this purpose, a series of phosphorylated xylosides and sulfated C-4 and C-6 analogs of Galβ1–3Gal was synthesized and tested as potential substrates for the recombinant enzymes. Our results revealed that the phosphorylation of Xyl on the C-2 position prevents GalT-I activity, suggesting that this modification may occur once Gal is attached to the Xyl residue of the nascent oligosaccharide linkage. On the other hand, we showed that sulfation on C-6 position of Gal1 of the Galβ1–3Gal analog markedly enhanced GlcAT-I catalytic efficiency and we demonstrated the importance of Trp243 and Lys317 residues of Gal1 binding site for enzyme activity. In contrast, we found that GlcAT-I was unable to use digalactosides as acceptor substrates when Gal1 was sulfated on C-4 position or when Gal2 was sulfated on both C-4 and C-6 positions. Altogether, we demonstrated that oligosaccharide modifications of the linkage region control the specificity of the glycosyltransferases, a process that may regulate maturation and processing of glycosaminoglycan chains. We determined whether the two major structural modifications, i.e. phosphorylation and sulfation of the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1), govern the specificity of the glycosyltransferases responsible for the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide primer.

Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). In most cases, biological activities of PGs are governed by interactions of their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains with growth factors, cytokines, morphogens, and a variety of protein ligands. Accordingly, the disruption of the glycosyltransferases involved in either initiation or elongation of GAG chains has severe biological consequences. In human, mutations of the gene encoding β1,4-galactosyltransferase 7 (referred to as GalT-I in GAG synthesis pathway) cause a progeroid variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome characterized by aged appearance, developmental delay, dwarfism, and various connective tissue abnormalities (2Quentin E. Gladen A. Roden L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Likewise, it has been shown that the mutations of EXT1 and EXT2 genes coding for glycosyltransferases responsible for heparan sulfate (HS) chain polymerization lead to the hereditary multiple exostosis disorders characterized by tumors of bony outgrowth (3Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 173: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (348) Google Scholar).The major GAGs found on PGs are HS/heparin and chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate, which are linear polysaccharides consisting of a repetition of [GlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–4] and [GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3] disaccharide units, respectively. The assembly of GAG chains is initiated by the synthesis of a common GAG-protein linkage structure, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-O-, which is attached to specific serine residues of different core proteins. This linkage tetrasaccharide is formed by the stepwise addition of each sugar residue from the corresponding UDP-sugar catalyzed by O-xylosyltransferase I (4Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), GalT-I (5Almeida R. Levery S.B. Mandel U. Kresse H. Schwientek T. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

The transfer of either a αGlcNAc or βGalNAc residue on the terminal GlcA of the linkage region initiates the polymerization of the HS or CS chains, respectively. HS and CS are further modified by the cooperative action of epimerases and sulfotransferases that adds considerable complexity and functionality to the polysaccharide GAG chains.Recently, structural studies have shown the presence of various modifications of the GAG-protein linkage region (for review see Ref 8Krishna N.R. Agrawal P.K. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2000; 56: 201-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfate substitutions are primarily found at the C-4 and/or C-6 positions of the outer Gal (referred to as Gal2) and of the inner Gal (referred to as Gal1) of the linkage tetrasaccharide, whereas the presence of a phosphate has been exclusively demonstrated on the C-2 position of Xyl (see Fig. 1A). C-6 sulfation of Gal2 has been identified as the predominant modification in human aggrecan CS chains (9Lauder R.M. Huckerby T.N. Brown G.M. Bayliss M.T. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and C-4 sulfation of the same Gal residue has been found in urinary trypsin inhibitor (10Yamada S. Oyama M. Yuki Y. Kato K. Sugahara K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (11Yamada S. Oyama M. Kinugasa H. Nakagawa T. Kawasaki T. Nagasawa S. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sulfation at the 4- and 6-positions of Gal1 and/or Gal2 is also present in CS from aggrecan of shark cartilage (12Sugahara K. Ohi Y. Harada T. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6027-6035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine nasal septum (13Cheng F. Heinegard D. Fransson L. Bayliss M. Bielicki J. Hopwood J. Yoshida K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29134-29140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). So far, sulfated Gal residues of the linkage region have been demonstrated for CS and dermatan sulfate but not in HS or heparin, whereas a C-2 phosphorylated Xyl residue has been found in both HS/heparin and CS/dermatan sulfate chains. Although the role of these substitutions is not fully understood, it has been suggested that phosphorylation and sulfation may regulate maturation and processing of growing GAG chains (16Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 17Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A prerequisite step in the evaluation of this hypothesis is the determination of the substrate specificity of the glycosyltransferases responsible for the biosynthesis of the linkage region with regard to phosphorylation and sulfation. Our group has been deeply involved in the structure-function studies of GlcAT-I, which catalyzes the transfer of GlcA onto Gal2 of Galβ1–3Gal, thus completing the final step of GAG-protein linkage synthesis (18Ouzzine M.

This enzyme has attracted much attention in our laboratory and others (21Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), because it appears to play a rate-limiting role in GAG biosynthesis (22Bai X. Wei G. Sinha A.

Biochem. 1991; 109: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GalT-I, which is responsible for the transfer of Gal onto the Xyl residue of the glycopeptide primer of PGs, has recently been cloned but has not been deeply characterized (5Almeida R. Levery S.B. Mandel U. Kresse H. Schwientek T. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26165-26171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).In this study, we determined whether the phosphorylation of Xyl and sulfation of Gal1 and/or Gal2 affect GalT-I and GlcAT-I activity, respectively. For this purpose, we designed and synthesized C-2-phosphorylated xylosides as well as C-4 and/or C-6-sulfated digalactose analogs of the GAG-protein linkage region. These compounds have been tested as potential substrates of the two recombinant human enzymes expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. We showed that GalT-I efficiently catalyzed the transfer of Gal onto the nonphosphorylated xyloside, whereas the phosphorylated analog was not the substrate, suggesting that C-2 phosphorylation precludes the transfer of the first Gal on Xyl of the glycopeptide primer. By contrast, we demonstrated that the Galβ1–3Gal(6-sulfate) derivative serves as a much better acceptor substrate for the recombinant human GlcAT-I than its unsulfated counterpart, raising the possibility that sulfation at the C-6 position of Gal1 may contribute to the efficient completion of the linkage region tetrasaccharide. Our data show that phosphorylation and sulfation critically influence the specificity of the glycosyltransferases involved in the formation of the GAG-protein linkage region.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcA, and anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated immunoglobulins were from Sigma.

The structure of the following compounds is presented in Fig. 1B: (1) Xylβ1-O-MN; (2) Xyl(2-phosphate)β1-O-MN; (3) Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-MN; and (4) Galβ1–4Xyl(2-phosphate)β1-O-MN. The treatment of known d-Xyl peracetate with 7-methoxy-2-naphthol in dichloromethane under the catalysis of trimethylsilyl triflate gave the crystalline (m.p. 154–155 °C) β-linked glycoside at a 77% yield. Trans-esterification of the latter compound with sodium methoxide in methanol gave quantitatively the Xylβ1-O-MN derivative (m.p. 176–177 °C). Treatment of this triol with 2-methoxypropene and (+, -)-camphorsulfonic acid in N,N-dimethylformamide under kinetic control afforded the 2,3-O-isopropylidene derivative (m.p. 137–138 °C) and its 3,4-isomer (m.p. 183–184 °C) at a yield of 69 and 18%, respectively. Phosphorylation at O-2 was achieved through the treatment of the 3,4-O-isopropylidene derivative with N,N-diisopropyl dibenzylphosphoramidite and 1-H-tetrazole in dichloromethane followed by in situ oxidation of the intermediate phosphite with m-chloroperbenzoic acid at -10 °C to give the corresponding dibenzylphosphate derivative (m.p. 106–107 °C) at a 87% yield. Concomitant hydrogenolysis of the benzyl groups and hydrolysis of the isopropylidene acetal under H2 with 10% (w/w) palladium on carbon in aqueous acetic acid followed by salification of the acidic product with diluted NaOH (pH meter control) provided the sodium salt of Xyl(2-phosphate)β1-O-MN, [α]D -17° (c1, water), as an amorphous solid at 71% overall yield. Condensation of the major 2,3-O-isopropylidene derivative with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyl-1-O-trichloroacetimidoyl-β-d-galactopyranose (24Rio S. Beau J-M. Jacquinet J.-C. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 219: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in toluene at 0 °C under the catalysis of trimethylsilyl triflate gave the β-linked disaccharide derivative at a 73% yield. Mild hydrolysis of the isopropylidene acetal with aqueous acetic acid afforded the corresponding diol at a 90% yield. This later compound was trans-esterified to give Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-MN (m.p. 238–240 °C) at a 94% yield. Tin-mediated regioselective acetylation at O-3 of the Xyl residue of the disaccharide diol, as previously reported (25Rio S. Beau J-M. Jacquinet J.-C. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 103-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for the synthesis of phosphorylated glycopeptides followed by phosphorylation at O-2 as described above, gave the corresponding fully protected disaccharide derivative at a 60% overall yield. Subsequent hydrogenolysis followed by hydrazinolysis of the esters and salification with NaOH gave Galβ1–4Xyl(2-phosphate)β1-O-MN as its sodium salt, [α]D -41° (c1, water), at an 81% overall yield. All of the synthetic compounds had analytical data (NMR, mass, and elemental analyses) fully consistent with the expected structures.The following methoxyphenyl (MP)-digalactosides, analogs of the GAG-protein linkage region, were prepared as previously described (26Jacquinet J-C. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

(5Almeida R. Levery S.B. Mandel U. Kresse H. Schwientek T. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26165-26171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The fragment amplified using Advantaq polymerase (Clontech) was subcloned into PCR2.1 (TA-cloning kit (Invitrogen)) and sequenced on both strands. The cDNA sequence was 100% identical to that previously described (5Almeida R. Levery S.B. Mandel U. Kresse H. Schwientek T. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

For the heterologous expression of the human GalT-I in P. pastoris, the full-length cDNA sequence was modified by PCR to include a SacII site and a Kozak consensus sequence at the 5′ end and a XbaI site at the 3′ end using appropriate oligonucleotides. The modified cDNA was then subcloned into the SacII-XbaI sites of the yeast expression vector pPICZB to produce pPICZ-GalT-I. Cloning of the full-length GlcAT-I cDNA and construction of the recombinant pPICZ-GlcAT-I were performed as previously described (19Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J.

Construction of amino acid substituted mutants of GlcAT-I was carried out using pPICZ-GlcAT-I as template with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Mutagenic primers are presented in Table I. Mutants were systematically checked by sequencing, and the various mutants were individually expressed in P. pastoris as described below.

Transformants were selected on YPD plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose) containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). The cells were grown in BMGY medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, and 1% (v/v) glycerol). Expression was induced by methanol (2%, v/v) for 48 h at 30 °C in a rotary shaker (180 rpm). Yeast cells were broken with glass beads and further submitted to differential centrifugation as previously described (19Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 100,000 × g pellet corresponding to the membrane fraction was resuspended by Dounce homogenization in sucrose-HEPES buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Protein concentration was evaluated by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar), and membrane fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and used for kinetic analyses.For purification of GlcAT-I, the supernatant from the 100,000 × g centrifugation containing the soluble GlcAT-I form (Thr76-Val335) was dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) at 4 °C overnight and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (6 × 1.5 cm, Sigma), which had been equilibrated with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The flow-through was applied onto a cation exchange support (Macro-Prep High-S, 11 × 21 cm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After washing with buffer A and then with the same buffer containing 100 mm NaCl (5-column volumes), the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.02–0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and immunoblotting. The protein was purified to apparent homogeneity, and 0.05–0.1 μg protein/assay was used for kinetic analyses.SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using a polyclonal anti-peptide antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins as secondary antibodies as previously described (19Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The amount of recombinant wild type and mutant GlcAT-I protein expressed in membrane fractions of yeast cells was evaluated from Western blot analysis using a calibration curve established with 0.01–0.10 μg of purified protein run on the same gel.Glycosyltransferase Activity Assays and Kinetics—For GalT-I assays, 50–100 μg of membrane proteins were incubated in 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm UDP-Gal, 1 mm xyloside (compounds 1 and 2) at 37 °C for 60 min in a total volume of 100 μl. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 6 m HCl. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 100,000 × g to precipitate proteins, and an aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm, Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) at a detection wavelength of 285 nm. The mobile phase was composed of 20% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water for the nonphosphorylated acceptor substrate (Xylβ1-O-MN) and 17% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.025% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water for the phosphorylated xyloside (Xyl(2-phosphate)β1-O-MN) at flow rate of 1 ml/min.Activity of recombinant human GlcAT-I was evaluated using Galβ1–3Galβ1-O-MP (compound 5) and each of the monosulfated (compounds 6–9) or disulfated digalactosides (compound 10) as acceptor substrate. Incubations were performed in 100 mm acetate buffer with 50 mm MnCl2, 50–100 μg of membrane proteins (or 0.05–0.1 μg of purified enzyme), 1–25 mm substrate, and 1 mm UDP-GlcA in a total volume of 100 μl at 37 °C for 60 min in a pH range from 5.0 to 7.5. The mixtures were applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) before chromatographic analysis to remove UDP-GlcA. After the cartridge was washed with 2 ml of water, the reaction product and the acceptor substrate were eluted by 1 ml of acetonitrile and further analyzed by gel filtration HPLC using a Superdex Peptide HR10/30 column (10 × 300 mm, Amersham Biosciences) with 0.02 m dipotassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl as eluent at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The reaction product was detected at a wavelength of 285 nm. We verified that no loss of reaction product occurred upon Sep-Pak extraction.For each set of experiments, control assays in which either the donor or the acceptor substrate was omitted were systematically run under the same conditions. The addition of a GlcA or Gal residue on the nonreducing end of acceptor substrates was verified by comparison of retention time with that of the corresponding chemically synthesized standards (see Fig. 1, B and C) and by the associated radioactivity monitored by a LB 507A Berthold radioactivity detector when incubations were carried out in the presence of UDP[14C]-GlcA or UDP[14C]-Gal (0.1 μCi) as donor substrate. Quantitation of the reaction products was performed with calibration curves drawn with increasing concentrations of the standards resolved under similar conditions. A time course of the glucuronosyltransferase and galactosyltransferase activities in membrane fractions showed that the product formation was linear with the time over 120 min. Initial rate data were subsequently taken after a 60-min incubation time.Apparent kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) of GalT-I were determined using linear least-squares regression analysis of double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus UDP-Gal (0–2 mm) at a constant concentration of Xylβ1-O-MN (10 mm) and of initial velocity versus acceptor substrate (0–25 mm) at a constant concentration of UDP-Gal (1 mm). Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) of GlcAT-I were determined using linear least-squares regression analysis of double-reciprocal plots of (1 mm) at an optimum of pH 6.5. Kinetic parameters of GlcAT-I toward Galβ1–3Gal(6-sulfate)β1-O-MP were determined in a 0–2.5 mm range of substrate at a constant concentration of UDP-GlcA (1 mm) and an optimum of pH 5.5.Molecular Modeling—The model structure of the GlcAT-I complex with the unsulfated and sulfated digalactosides was built by energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculations based on the initial structure of GlcAT-I (Protein Data Bank code 1FGG) (21Pedersen L.C.

The conformation with the lowest estimated free energy of binding for each substrate was minimized using AMBER 7.0 program (30Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2626) Google Scholar). To avoid the missing residue regions in the Protein Data Bank file, all of the minimizations were done in a sphere of a 12-Å radius from the sulfated molecule and all of the residues outside this sphere were kept fixed. Charges of Galβ1–3Gal(6-sulfate) were calculated using GAUSSIAN94 package (31Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar) and the HF/6–31 G* basis set. Atom-centered charges were fitted with Antechamber of AMBER 7 software package (30Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys.

Osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells were allowed to attach to RGDS peptides that had been tethered to a silicone surface utilizing a previously described grafting technique. The RGDS-modified surface caused up-regulation of αvβ3 integrin. We noted that there was an increase in expression of activated focal adhesion kinase and activated Akt. There was no change in the expression level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, or the inactivated form of Bad, pBad. Attachment to the RGDS-treated membrane completely abolished apoptosis induced by staurosporine, the Ca2+·Pi ion pair, and sodium nitroprusside. However, the surface modification did not interfere with apoptosis mediated by the free RGDS peptide or serum-free medium. When the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway was inhibited, RGDS-dependent resistance to apoptosis was eliminated. These results indicated that the binding of cells to RGDS abrogated apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway and that the suppression of apoptosis was dependent on the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). The survival signal is mediated by transmembrane integrin receptors that provide a mechanical link between the cell and the hydrophilic peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) on extracellular macromolecules (2Hynes R.O.

The interaction between the RGD motif and integrin receptors causes phosphorylation of the non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; RT, reverse transcription; pBad, phosphorylated Bad; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Once phosphorylated, FAK provides binding sites for Src homology-2 domains of the survival signaling pathway molecules Grb2-Sos and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (16Schlaepfer D.D.

Of the downstream targets of PI3K, Akt plays a critical role in the regulation of the balance between apoptosis and survival. Once the Akt pathway is activated, there is stimulation of a number of downstream events that include: phosphorylation and inactivation of caspase-9, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis and enhancement of cell survival (18Datta S.R.

Despite overwhelming evidence that relates integrin-mediated adhesion with cell survival (26Globus R.K. Doty S.B. Lull J.C. Holmuhamedov E. Humphries M.J. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the relationship between adhesion and the regulation of bone cell apoptosis is poorly understood. In this study, we address this issue by examining signaling events that accompany the binding of osteoblast-like cells to an RGD-modified surface. We demonstrate that the surface increases both integrin and FAK expression and up-regulates the PI3K survival pathway. In addition, we show that the RGD-modified surface inhibits mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the mechanism by which RGDS-mediated integrin attachment promotes the survival of osteoblast-like cells. We chemically bonded an RGDS peptide to a functionalized silicone membrane. A similar RGES-grafted surface was used as a control substrate. MC3T3-E1 cells were then grown on the RGDS and control surfaces. We chose to use this osteoblast-like cell line, as our previous studies have shown that these cells exhibit an apoptotic response identical to that of primary osteoblasts (13Perlot R.L. Shapiro I.M.

Other workers have demonstrated that this cell line mimics the major phenotypic characteristics of osteoblasts (28Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Changes in intracellular signaling molecules, FAK, phospho-FAK, Akt, phospho-Akt, Bad, phospho-Bad, and Bcl-2, were evaluated by Western blot analysis. PCR analysis was also used to evaluate changes in expression of Bad and Bcl-2. Rather than evaluate a wide range of integrins, we focused on αvβ3 by Western blot analysis. These integrins are known to be expressed by MC3T3-E1 cells as well as other osteoblast-like cells and primary osteoblasts derived from bovine, rat, and human bone samples. Moreover, they are expressed at all stages of development. To evaluate the impact of the peptide on susceptibility to apoptosis, cells were cultured on the RGDS-grafted surface for 3 days and then treated by serum starvation or with low doses of the following agents: staurosporine, the Ca2+·Pi ion pair, sodium nitroprusside or free RGDS peptide. These agents were selected for two reasons: they are effective osteoblast apoptogens, and they activate the extrinsic, as well as the intrinsic, apoptotic pathway. Cell death was determined by the MTT assay. Finally, the importance of PI3K pathway-activated survival signals was assessed through the use of the specific kinase inhibitor, LY294002. Anti-αv and anti-β3 (polyclonal) integrin antibodies were obtained from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr397) rabbit anti-serum and anti-FAK rabbit polyclonal antibodies were provided by Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Akt and anti-phospho Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-Bad polyclonal, anti-phospho-Bad, and anti-Bcl-2 antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-GAPDH antibody was obtained from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, NJ). RGDS and RGES peptides were obtained from Sigma. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002, was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Protein A-Sepharose beads were from Amersham, and gel/blotting material was obtained from Invitrogen. RGD peptides were grafted to silicone surfaces utilizing a technique described previously (9Cavalcanti-Adam E.A. Shapiro I.M. Composto R.J. Macarak E.J. Adams C.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 2130-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) based on a method originally reported by Dee et al. (7Dee K.C. Rueger D.C. Andersen T.T. Bizios R. Biomaterials. 1996; 17: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Dee K.C. Andersen T.T. Bizios R.

Briefly, 0.005-inch silicone sheets (Silastic Q7-4840, Specialty Manufacturing Inc., Saginaw, MI) were exposed for 10 min to UV light/ozone (UVO Cleaner, Jelight Company Inc., Irvine, CA) to functionalize and oxidize the surface. The functionalized silicone surface was then modified by treatment with 0.2 mm 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (A3648, Sigma) in hexane for 45 min. The 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane molecule reacted with the OH groups, generating an aminated surface. The silicone membranes were then sonicated (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) in a hexane bath to remove excess reactants. The aminated membranes were incubated with 0.2 mm RGDS or RGES peptides in 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-ethyl morpholine (Sigma). The carboxyl terminus of the peptide reacted with the amino group of the silane molecule, thereby forming a covalent link to the biomaterial surface. The membranes modified with the bound peptides were rinsed with N,N-dimethylformamide and distilled water. Non-bound peptides were removed by sonication in N,N-dimethylformamide for 15 min. Finally, the membranes with covalently attached peptides were sterilized in 75% ethanol. A control surface was engineered using RGES peptides using an identical procedure as described for RGDS. It has been shown that when Glu is substituted for Asp there is a profound loss of biological activity (31Puleo D.A. Bizios R. Bone. 1991; 12: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells were used in this study. Our previous work has demonstrated that the apoptotic response of MC3T3-E1 cells is identical to that of primary human osteoblasts isolated from bone fragments (27Adams C.S. Mansfield K. Perlot R.L. Shapiro I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20316-20322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in 10 ml of complete medium consisting of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, pH 7.4. After the cells had reached confluence, they were released by treatment with 5 ml of 0.1% collagenase in Ca2+- and Mg+-free Hanks' buffered saline solution. The cells were then replated on the modified silicone membranes in 100-mm culture dishes and 12- or 24-well plates (Corning Glass). Cultures were fed every other day with complete medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate. To evaluate cell death, osteoblast-like cells were plated on experimental (RGDS) and control (RGES) substrates in 12- or 24-well plates at a density of 50,000/well or 25,000/well, respectively. After 3 days in culture in complete media, the osteoblasts were incubated overnight with sublethal doses of staurosporine (0.1 and 0.5 μm) (32Szymczyk K.H. Shapiro I.M. Adams C.S. Bone. 2004; 34: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Mansfield K. Rajpurohit R. Shapiro I.M. J. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20316-20322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), sodium nitroprusside (0.5 and 0.1 mm) (34Chen R.M. Liu H.C. Lin Y.L. Jean W.C. Chen J.S. Wang J.H. J. Orthop. Res. 2002; 20: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or RGDS (1 mm and 5 mm) (13Perlot R.L. Shapiro I.M. Mansfield K. Adams C.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or were serum-starved (35Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The ion pair, sodium nitroprusside, and staurosporine all induce cell death through the intrinsic pathway; RGDS and serum starvation probably kill osteoblasts by a mitochondria-independent pathway. After 0.5, 3, 24, and 72 h in culture on the prepared RGDS or RGES surfaces, cells were solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 100 μg of protein was immunocomplexed with 1:50 dilution of anti-β3 integrin polyclonal IgG. After gentle mixing and incubation for 1 h on ice, 20 μg of protein A-Sepharose beads was added to the lysate. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 s at 4 °C; the pellet was washed five times with lysis buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were separated in 3–8% Tris acetate gel (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 5% skim milk powder. After washing in Tris-buffered saline, the blots were incubated with αv antibody (1:1000) overnight at room temperature. The blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxide-conjugated antibody for 1 h, and positive bands were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak X-Omat blue film (Eastman Kodak Co.). GAPDH was used as a control to estimate protein loading on the gel. The concentration of the anti-GAPDH antibody was 2.4 μg/ml. Western Blot Analysis—The protocol described above was followed for assessing the expression of FAK and phosphorylated FAK (antibody concentration 1:500), Akt and phospho-Akt (antibody concentration 1:500), Bad, phosphorylated Bad, and Bcl-2 (antibody concentration 1:300). GAPDH was used as a loading control. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—After 30 min, 3 h, 24 h, and 3 days in culture, RNA was extracted from osteoblast-like cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes on modified surfaces using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed by the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis using a 2% agarose gel. Primers for Bad (forward, AGCGTACGCACACCTATCCT, and reverse, TGCTTCGGCTGATAAGTCCT), Bcl-2 (forward, CACCATGTGTCCATCTGACC, and reverse, ACCCAGAATCCACTCACACC), and a control, GAPDH (forward, GGGAAGCCCATCACCATC, and reverse, GCACCGGCCTCACCC) were used. After 3 days in culture on the prepared surfaces, cells were incubated overnight with sublethal doses of apoptogens. Untreated cells and cells plated on the RGES surface were used as controls. Cell death was measured using the MTT analysis (36McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 153-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 37Meleti Z. Shapiro I.M. Adams C.S. Bone. 2000; 27: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the ability of mitochondrial dehydrogenases to oxidize thiazolyl blue (MTT) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a tetrazolium salt (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenylterazolium bromide), to an insoluble blue formazan product. The cells were incubated with the MTT reagent (120 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h. After the supernatant was removed, 400 μl of 0.04 mol/liter HCl in isopropanol was added to each well, and the optical density of the solution was read at 590 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. As the generation of the blue product is proportional to the dehydrogenase activity, a decrease in the absorbance at 590 nm provides a direct measurement of the number of viable cells. To determine the contribution of the PI3K pathway to inhibition of apoptosis, some cell populations were pretreated with 50 μm LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor (38Squires M.S. Hudson E.A. Howells L.

Okochi H. Tamaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Following this pretreatment, cell death was determined as described above. Experiments were repeated three to five times. Similar results were seen with each of the replicates. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance; the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test for a comparison of individual means was used. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Osteoblast Binding to RGD-grafted Surfaces Up-regulates Integrin Expression—Integrin expression levels were evaluated in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells cultured on RGD-treated membranes after 0.5, 3, 24, and 72 h. Fig. 1 shows that there was an increase in αvβ3 heterodimer expression on the RGDS surface when compared with the RGES controls. Expression levels were raised after 24 h and maintained for 72 h. Osteoblast Binding to RGD Peptides Up-regulates Survival Pathways—Integrin signaling events that are triggered by osteoblastic attachment to the RGDS-grafted surface were evaluated by measuring Bcl-2, Bad, and FAK expression. FAK (Fig. 2A) and phosphorylated FAK (Fig. 2B) were constitutively expressed by cells adherent to both the RGD-and RGE-grafted surfaces. A modest increase in phosphorylated FAK was evident in cells adherent to the RGD-grafted surface (Fig. 2B). We investigated downstream signaling events mediated by activation of FAK. Western blot analysis showed that for the first 24 h, there was little difference in levels of Akt expressed by osteoblasts on the two surfaces (Fig. 3). However, at 72 h, there was a considerable increase in Akt protein expression in cells cultured on the RGDS surface. Interestingly, there was little difference in activated phospho-Akt on either surface at 0.5 or 3 h. However, by 24 h, there was a considerable increase in activated Akt in relationship to GAPDH. The increase in phospho-Akt was maintained for 72 h. At this time, the increase in phospho-Akt was directly proportional to the increase in total Akt protein. To further explore downstream signaling events, we examined the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad (Fig. 4A) and the inactive form of the protein, pBad (Fig. 4B). Both proteins were constitutively expressed by the osteoblast-like cells that were adherent to the RGDS- and RGES-grafted surface. No significant changes in Bad or pBad were observed. mRNA analysis confirmed this observation, as no changes in message levels were seen for Bad at any time point (Fig. 4C). Finally, we examined the Bcl-2 protein (Fig. 5A) and mRNA (Fig. 5B) expression. No difference was observed in either Bcl-2 protein or mRNA levels on the RGDS or RGES surface.Fig. 5Expression of Bcl-2 by RGDS-attached osteoblast-like cells by Western blot and RT-PCR analysis. MC3T3-E1 cells were attached to the RGDS and RGES surfaces for 0.5, 3, 24, and 72 h, and Bcl-2 expression levels were determined by Western blot (A) and RT-PCR (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Osteoblast Binding to RGD-grafted Surfaces Suppresses Apoptotic Sensitivity—How does integrin-mediated adhesion of osteoblasts to the biomimetic surface influence apoptotic sensitivity? To address this question, cells were grown on the RGDS substrate and treated with 0.1 and 0.5 μm staurosporine; no significant cell killing was observed (Fig. 6A). In contrast, staurosporine killed osteoblasts maintained on the RGES surface in a dose-dependent manner. Fig. 6B demonstrates the effect of surface chemistry on the apoptogenic activity of the Ca2+·Pi ion pair. Although 3 mm Pi and 2.4 mm Ca2+ did not kill osteoblasts grown on the RGDS surface, there was a significant increase in cell death on the RGES surface. A further increase in cell death was apparent when osteoblasts were treated with 3 mm Pi and 2.9 mm Ca2+. Again, there was no significant increase in death among osteoblasts maintained on the RGDS surface. The effect of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside on osteoblast apoptosis was similar to that of the Ca2+·Pi ion pair and staurosporine. Fig. 6C shows that at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 mm, sodium nitroprusside killed 45 and 65% of osteoblasts cultured on the RGES surface, respectively. These concentrations of sodium nitroprusside failed to kill osteoblasts on the RGDS surface. In contrast to these agents, free RGDS (Fig. 6D) and serum-free medium (Fig. 6E) killed osteoblasts on both surfaces. The tetrapeptide RGDS killed osteoblasts that were anchored to both the RGDS- and RGES-grafted surface (Fig. 6D). A similar effect was seen when there was serum withdrawal (Fig. 6E). Thus, in the absence of serum, 45 and 60% of osteoblasts cultured on RGES and RGDS were killed, respectively. Resistance to Apoptosis by RGD-anchored Osteoblasts Is Mediated by PI3K—To test the hypothesis that resistance to apoptosis was mediated by the PI3K pathway, RGDS-anchored cells were cultured in media supplemented with LY294002. When cells adherent to the RGDS surface were then treated with staurosporine, a profound increase in cell death was observed (Fig. 7A), comparable with the response of cells adherent to the RGES surface. A similar response was seen when the MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with the Ca2+·Pi ion pair (Fig. 7B). It was evident that when the PI3K survival pathway was blocked, the protection provided by the RGD surface was lost, and the cells became susceptible to apoptosis. In contrast, when osteoblast-like cells were attached to RGES and treated with the Ca2+·Pi ion pair, their apoptotic sensitivity was not affected by the PI3K inhibitor. Results of the investigation indicated that attachment of osteoblasts to an RGDS-grafted surface significantly inhibited the activation of apoptosis. The RGDS-grafted surface caused up-regulation of αvβ3 integrin receptors as well as raised expression of activated FAK. Furthermore, this study revealed that there was a demonstrable increase in activated Akt following culture on RGDS. Using the inhibitor LY294002, we confirmed that activation of the PI3K pathway was required for protection against apoptosis. These results suggest that activation of the PI3K pathway and the subsequent phosphorylation of FAK and Akt enhance the survival of osteoblasts challenged with exogenous apoptogens. Surprisingly, survival on the RGDS-grafted surface was evident when osteoblasts were treated with a subgroup of apoptogens. Thus, although serum starvation and free RGDS peptides cause a dramatic fall in the number of live osteoblasts, those agents that acted through the mitochondrial pathway (the Ca2+·Pi ion pair, staurosporine, and sodium nitroprusside) failed to induce cell death on the RGDS surface. Based on these findings, we conclude that RGDS-integrin binding enhanced PI3K activity and protected cells from mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. To engage the osteoblast integrin receptor, we chemically engineered the silicone surface with RGDS peptides (9Cavalcanti-Adam E.A. Shapiro I.M. Composto R.J. Macarak E.J. Adams C.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 2130-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have reported recently that this technique introduces a very high (saturating) surface concentration of RGDS peptides (40El Ghannam A.R. Ducheyne P. Risbud M. Adams C.S. Shapiro I.M. Castner D. Golledge S. Composto R.J. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 2004; 68: 615-627Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As the same chemistry was used to tether the control peptides, a similar high concentration of RGES peptides would be expected to be present on those membranes, and, as might be expected, the tethered RGDS and control peptides exhibited similar physical characteristics. Despite these chemical and physical similarities and in line with the studies reported by Hynes (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar), the RGDS-engineered surface enhanced the immediate expression of the αvβ3 integrin. In contrast, there was delayed expression of these integrin receptors on cells attached to the RGES-grafted surface. Late receptor expression was not surprising, as adherent cells would be expected to secrete extracellular proteins that contain RGDS peptide motifs. Indeed, we found that by 72 h, osteoblasts attached to both the RGDS and RGES surfaces expressed the same integrin levels. At early time periods, prior to synthesis of an extensive extracellular matrix, we noted that integrin-mediated attachment to RGDS influenced cell function. Thus, there was an immediate increase in FAK expression and a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated FAK. Although the role of the phosphorylated form of FAK is not known with certainty, it is likely that it activates PI3K, possibly through the Src homology domain 2, and promotes the transduction of survival signals (42Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 43Chan P.C. Lai J.F. Cheng C.H. Tang M.J. Chiu C.C. Chen H.C. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Indeed, at 3 days, we noted up-regulation and activation of Akt (phosphorylated Akt) in bone cells cultured on the RGDS-modified surfaces. However, in the same time period, there was also an increase in total Akt protein. This result suggests that although the effective concentration of activated Akt is elevated on the RGDS surface, the increase reflects a raised level of total protein expression rather than an increase in Akt phosphorylation activity. Irrespective of whether there is raised phosphorylation of Akt or just an increase in the total Akt level, the end result should be the same, enhanced osteoblast survival and protection from exogenous apoptogens. Although Bad is a pro-apoptotic protein, its phosphorylation by Akt serves to decrease the impact of this key signaling molecule. Accordingly, we determined both Bad and pBad expression levels in the RGDS-tethered cells. We observed no differences in Bad expression between bone cells cultured on the RGDS-grafted and control surfaces, nor was there a significant increase in pBad. In concert with Bad, we evaluated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. This protein has been shown to be up-regulated in Chinese hamster ovary cells by the α5β1 integrin (45Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, in osteoblast-like cells, we failed to detect significant changes in the expression of Bcl-2 at either the message or protein levels. Although steady state values of pBad, Bad, and Bcl-2 were not determined, the result suggests that integrin binding and FAK and Akt activation did not influence the activities of key pro- and anti-apoptotic regulatory proteins concerned with survival of osteoblast-like cells adherent to the RGDS surface. We used a number of different apoptogens to explore the relationship between cell survival and integrin attachment to tethered RGDS peptides. The apoptogen concentrations that were used in this study were shown previously to induce apoptosis in a number of cell types (13Perlot R.L. Shapiro I.M. Mansfield K. Adams C.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Adams C.S. Mansfield K. Perlot R.L. Shapiro I.M. J. Biol.

Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). By allowing the osteoblast-like cells to attach to the RGDS-modified surfaces over 72 h, we mitigated the immediate signaling effects of integrin binding and observed how attachment modulates the apoptotic response of the tethered differentiating osteoblasts. With respect to the Ca2+·Pi ion pair, we were able to obtain almost complete protection from apoptosis by allowing the cells to bind to the RGDS peptide. This finding was of considerable interest, as we had reported previously that when cells are attached to tissue culture plastic, the ion pair promotes a mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and a rapid induction of osteoblast apoptosis (27Adams C.S. Mansfield K. Perlot R.L. Shapiro I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20316-20322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To confirm that the attachment peptide blocked apoptosis, we treated the osteoblasts with sodium nitroprusside. We had shown previously that this agent induces death via the mitochondrial pathway, and inhibitors of NO synthase block Ca2+·Pi-mediated cell death (27Adams C.S. Mansfield K. Perlot R.L. Shapiro I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20316-20322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In concert with the ion pair, sodium nitroprusside failed to promote apoptosis of osteoblast-like cells bound to the RGDS-grafted surface. On the basis of these two studies, it is concluded that the surface maintains cell viability by blocking the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and thereby preserving mitochondrial function. Of the other apoptogen studied, it was noted that staurosporine failed to kill osteoblasts attached to the RGDS membrane. Although staurosporine is a nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor, it does cause a mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (47Tafani M. Minchenko D.A. Serroni A. Farber J.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2459-2466PubMed Google Scholar), and hence its mode of killing is similar to the ion pair (27Adams C.S. Mansfield K. Perlot R.L. Shapiro I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20316-20322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and sodium nitroprusside (41Piantadosi C.A. Tatro L.G. Whorton A.R. Nitric Oxide. 2002; 6: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Conversely, serum starvation or treatment with RGDS peptides promoted death of cells attached to both the RGDS- and RGES-grafted surfaces. Although the death pathway activated by free RGDS peptides is not known, it is likely that the peptides directly engage pro-caspase-3, and there is minimal mitochondrial involvement (46Buckley C.D. Pilling D. Henriquez N.V. Parsonage G. Threlfall K. Scheel-Toellner D. Simmons D.L. Akbar A.N. Lord J.M. Salmon M. Nature. 1999; 397: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The effects of serum starvation are more complex and probably encompass changes in both mitochondrial function and mitogenic signals (13Perlot R.L. Shapiro I.M. Mansfield K. Adams C.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This dual effect would explain why some cells responded to this type of apoptogenic challenge. To test the hypothesis that inhibition of apoptosis was dependent on the activity of PI3K, we treated adherent osteoblast-like cells with the inhibitor LY294002 and then challenged the cells with a number of agents discussed above. We noted that in the presence of the inhibitor, osteoblasts were no longer resistant to the Ca2+·Pi ion pair, and more than 60% of the cells were killed. Likewise, when treated with staurosporine and sodium nitroprusside, the tethered cells underwent apoptosis. The results of all of these studies using multiple apoptogens strongly indicate that when osteoblasts are attached to RGDS-tethered surfaces, there is inhibition of apoptotic responses transduced by mitochondria and enhanced survival activated by the PI3K pathway. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that the extracellular matrix is a very complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic structure, and the number of receptors and receptor subtypes in bone cells is enormous. Nevertheless, the use of a single tethered peptide provides a unique approach to delineating which pathways are activated and permits dissection of the sequence of events that characterize outside-inside signal transduction. Because many of the attachment motifs are now known and linkage chemistries are available, it should be possible to evaluate the contribution of each of the proteins of the extracellular matrix to osteoblast differentiation, maturation, and function. The use of such a system should enhance elucidation of crosstalk between ligands and growth factors and provide access to downstream effector pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1979498341,"Binding of fibrinogen to platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3 mediates platelet aggregation, and thus inhibition of alphaIIbbeta3 represents a powerful therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular medicine. However, the currently used inhibitors of alphaIIbbeta3 demonstrate several adverse effects like thrombocytopenia and bleeding, which are associated with their property to bind to non-activated alphaIIbbeta3. To circumvent these problems, we designed blocking single-chain antibody-fragments (scFv) that bind to alphaIIbbeta3 exclusively in its activated conformation. Two naive phage libraries were created: a natural phage library, based on human lymphocyte cDNA, and a synthetic library, with randomized VHCDR3. We performed serial rounds of subtractive panning with depletion on non-activated and selection on activated alphaIIbbeta3, which were provided on resting and ADP-stimulated platelets and CHO cells, expressing wild-type or mutated and thereby activated alphaIIbbeta3. In contrast to isolated, immobilized targets, as generally used for phage display, this unique cell-based approach for panning allowed the preservation of functional integrin conformation. Thereby, we obtained several scFv-clones that demonstrated exclusive binding to activated platelets and complete inhibition of fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation. Interestingly, all activation-specific clones contained an RXD pattern in the HCDR3. Binding studies on transiently expressed point mutants and mouse-human domain-switch mutants of alphaIIbbeta3 indicate a binding site similar to fibrinogen. In conclusion, we generated human activation-specific scFvs against alphaIIbbeta3, which bind selectively to activated alphaIIbbeta3 and thereby potently inhibit fibrinogen binding to alphaIIbbeta3 and platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2166923441,"Functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) may result in part from axon outgrowth and related plasticity through coordinated changes at the molecular level. We employed microarray analysis to identify a subset of genes the expression patterns of which were temporally coregulated and correlated to functional recovery after SCI. Steady-state mRNA levels of this synchronously regulated gene cluster were depressed in both ventral and dorsal horn neurons within 24 h after injury, followed by strong re-induction during the following 2 wk, which paralleled functional recovery. The identified cluster includes neuritin, attractin, microtubule-associated protein 1a, and myelin oligodendrocyte protein genes. Transcriptional and protein regulation of this novel gene cluster was also evaluated in spinal cord tissue and in single neurons and was shown to play a role in axonal plasticity. Finally, in vitro transfection experiments in primary dorsal root ganglion cells showed that cluster members act synergistically to drive neurite outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2040722223,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1, the key negative regulator of interferon (IFN)-γ-dependent signaling, is induced in response to IFNγ. SOCS-1 binds to and inhibits the IFNγ receptor-associated kinase Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 2 and inhibits its function in vitro, but the mechanism by which SOCS-1 inhibits IFNγ-dependent signaling in vivo is not clear. Upon stimulation, mouse IFNγ receptor subunit 1 (IFNGR1) is phosphorylated on several cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, and Tyr419 is required for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 activation in mouse embryo fibroblasts. However, the functions of the other three cytoplasmic tyrosine residues are not known. Here we show that Tyr441 is required to attenuate STAT1 activation in response to IFNγ. Several tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of IFNGR1, expressed at normal levels in stable pools of IFNGR1-null cells, were analyzed for the phosphorylation of STAT1 during a 48-h period, and antiviral activity in response to IFNγ was also measured. Stronger activation of STAT1 was observed in cells expressing all IFNGR1 variants mutated at Tyr441, and, consistently, stronger antiviral activity was also observed in these cells. Furthermore, constitutive overexpression of SOCS-1 inhibited IFNγ-dependent signaling only in cells expressing IFNGR1 variants that included the Tyr441 mutation. Mutation of Tyr441 also blocked the ability of SOCS-1 to bind to IFNGR1 and JAK2 in response to IFNγ and the normal down-regulation of STAT1 activation and antiviral activity. These results, together with data from the literature, suggest a model in which, in response to IFNγ, phosphorylation of Tyr441 creates a docking site for SOCS-1, which then binds to JAK2 within the receptor-JAK complex to partially inhibit JAK2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the virtually complete blockade of STAT1 phosphorylation by overexpressed SOCS-1 in this experiment suggests that the binding of SOCS-1 to Tyr441 also blocks the access of STAT1 to Tyr419 and that this effect may be the principal mechanism of inhibition of downstream signaling.

Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). The major signal transduction pathway activated by IFNγ has been elucidated through both biochemical and genetic studies. The IFNγ receptor complex consists of two receptor subunits, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, and the tyrosine kinases Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2, which bind to IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, respectively. IFNγ induces the oligomerization of the receptor subunits, leading to the activation of JAK1 and JAK2, which then phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of IFNGR1. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 is then recruited to the receptor complex and phosphorylated on Tyr701, allowing it to be released, form homodimers, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to γ-activated sequences to activate the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1Stark G.R.

The situation for IFNγ-dependent signaling has been well studied. Activation of JAK1 and JAK2 is mediated by trans- and autophosphorylation. Phosphorylated Tyr419 of IFNGR1 creates the docking site for STAT1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), and phosphorylation of Tyr440 of human IFNGR1 has a major role in activating STAT1 and mediating antiviral activity. Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation of this motif impairs STAT1 activation as well as the expression of ISGs (29Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D.

Here, we investigate the involvement of specific tyrosine residues of IFNGR1 in IFNγ-dependent signaling and find that Tyr441 is required for attenuation. Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation of this residue leads to stronger STAT1 activation and antiviral activity, and inhibition of signaling in response to SOCS-1 requires Tyr441, as does the IFNγ-dependent binding of SOCS-1 to IFNGR1 and JAK2.

Virus-infected cells were maintained in complete medium plus 2 μg/ml puromycin or 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Western Analyses—After treatment, cells at 80% confluence in 100-mm dishes were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellets were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin.

Antiviral Assays—Cells seeded into 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well were incubated overnight at 37 °C and treated with serial 10-fold dilutions of IFNγ for 18 h. Where indicated, the cells were challenged for 20 h with encephalomyocarditis virus (0.5 plaque-forming unit/cell), fixed, and stained with Giemsa. Coimmunoprecipitation—After treatment, cells at 80% confluence in 150-mm dishes were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin.

Tyrosine Residues of IFNGR1 Provide Negative Regulation of IFNγ-dependent Signaling—Mouse IFNGR1 has four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, which are phosphorylated upon stimulation with IFNγ. Tyr419 is required for the activation of STAT1 (46Qing Y. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41679-41685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 47Woldman I. Varinou L.

Previous studies have shown that Tyr759 of gp130, which is not needed for STAT3 activation, is required for the negative regulation of this process (36Nicholson S.E. De Souza D. Fabri L.J. Corbin J. Willson T.A. Zhang J.G. Silva A. Asimakis M. Farley A. Nash A.D. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To reveal whether a tyrosine residue of IFNGR1 other than Tyr419 is similarly required for the negative regulation of IFNγ-dependent signaling, IFNGR1-null cells expressing either wild-type or 3F/419Y IFNGR1 (three of the four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanines) were used to examine the phosphorylation on tyrosine of STAT1, which was stronger in cells expressing 3F/419Y than in cells expressing wild-type IFNGR1 (Fig. 1a). Because phosphorylated STAT1 is essential for the transcription of most IFNγ-induced genes, the expression of three ISGs was also examined. After treatment with IFNγ, the levels of irf-1, ip-10, and socs-3 mRNAs were increased by 2-fold or more in cells expressing 3F/419Y compared with cells expressing wild-type IFNGR1 (Fig. 1b). Therefore, STAT1 activation is negatively regulated by a tyrosine residue other than Tyr419 of IFNGR1.Fig. 1Tyrosine residues are involved in regulating STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG expression. a, cells expressing wild-type (WT) IFNGR1 or the 3F/419Y mutant were treated with IFNγ for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 6, or 16 h. Total cell lysates were analyzed by the Western method, using antibodies against phospho-STAT1 (pYSTAT1) and actin. b, cells expressing wild-type (WT) IFNGR1 or the 3F/419Y mutant were treated with IFNγ for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by the Northern method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tyr441 of IFNGR1 Is Required for Negative Regulation of STAT1 Activation in Response to IFNγ—To determine which tyrosine(s) might be required, several different tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants were generated (Fig. 2). In mutant 2F/441Y/419Y, STAT1 phosphorylation was attenuated normally, and the attenuation was abolished in all mutants that include Y441F (Fig. 3a). Note that the basal levels of STAT1 in these cells are very low. Detailed time courses with single tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants confirmed that Tyr441 is the primary residue that mediates negative regulation of STAT1 activation in response to IFNγ (Fig. 3b). To test whether Tyr441 is also involved in modulating the antiviral response, an assay was performed to assess the ability of IFNγ to protect cells from the cytopathic effects of encephalomyocarditis virus in cells expressing wild-type IFNGR1 or several mutants. Cells expressing the 3F/419Y, 2F/285Y/419Y, or 2F/370Y/419Y mutants of IFNGR1 were protected at much lower doses of IFNγ than were cells expressing wild-type IFNGR1 or the 2F/441Y/419Y mutant (Fig. 3c). These data provide additional evidence that Tyr441 of IFNGR1 mediates the negative regulation of IFNγ-dependent signaling, including antiviral activity. Inhibition of IFNγ-dependent Signaling by SOCS-1 Is Mediated by Tyr441—Previous studies identified SOCS-1 as a critical inhibitor of IFNγ-dependent signaling (7Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar); SOCS-1 was expressed constitutively in cells with wild-type IFNGR1 or the 3F/419Y, 2F/441Y/419Y, and 3Y/441F mutants, and responses to IFNγ were examined. SOCS-1 blocked STAT1 phosphorylation virtually completely, but only in cells expressing wild-type IFNGR1 or the 2F/441Y/419Y mutant, and not in cells expressing the 3F/419Y or 3Y/441F mutants (Fig. 4a). Constitutive overexpression of SOCS-1 attenuated the IFNγ-dependent phosphorylation of JAK2 by about 2-fold in cells expressing wild-type IFNGR1 or the 2F/441Y/419Y mutant, but not in cells expressing the 3F/419Y or 3Y/441F mutants, and the phosphorylation of JAK1 was intact (Fig. 4b). Protein levels of JAK1 and JAK2 did not change during the time course investigated (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that SOCS-1-null mice are more resistant to viral infection than are wild-type mice (11Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Cell. 1999; 98: 597-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and, conversely, that overexpression of SOCS-1 completely blocks the antiviral activity of IFNγ (13Song M.M. Shuai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35056-35062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Constitutively overexpressed SOCS-1 abrogated antiviral responses in cells expressing wild-type IFNGR1 or the 2F/441Y/419Y mutant but did not inhibit this response in cells carrying the 3F/419Y or 3Y/441F mutants of IFNGR1. Consistent with these results, IFNγ protected cells expressing the 3F/419Y or 3Y/441F mutants of IFNGR1 at lower doses than cells with wild-type IFNGR1 or the 2F/441Y/419Y mutant (Fig. 4c). These results indicate that Tyr441 is required to mediate the inhibitory effect of SOCS-1 in IFNγ-dependent signaling. Tyr441 Is Required for the IFNγ-dependent Association of SOCS-1 and IFNGR1—The results cited above show that inhibition of IFNγ-dependent signaling by SOCS-1 requires Tyr441 of IFNGR1. Does SOCS-1 bind to IFNGR1, and, if so, does binding require Tyr441? Coimmunoprecipitation Western analysis showed that, in response to IFNγ, association was observed only in cells expressing wild-type IFNGR1 or the 2F/441Y/419Y mutant, and not in cells with the 3F/419Y or 3Y/441F mutants. In addition, association of SOCS-1 and JAK2 was also observed only in cells with wild-type IFNGR1 or the 2F/441Y/419Y mutant (Fig. 5). These data indicate that SOCS-1 is recruited to the IFNγ receptor complex in a ligand-dependent manner and that Tyr441 is required for this association. Contribution of Specific Tyrosine Residues of IFNGR1 to IFNγ-dependent Signaling—In response to IFNγ, the phosphorylation of Tyr419 of murine IFNGR1 is absolutely required for STAT1 activation (46Qing Y. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41679-41685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), the antiviral response (Fig. 3c), and the transcription of ISGs in reconstituted IFNGR1-null MEFs. 2Y. Qing and G. R. Stark, unpublished data. It is interesting that the requirement for the corresponding tyrosine residue of human IFNGR1, Tyr440, appears to be different: in primary human fibroblasts lacking IFNGR1 and reconstituted with the Y440F mutant, the expression of ISGs in response to IFNγ was substantial, although the antiviral effect was inhibited. 3A. P. Costa-Pereira, D. Watling, and I. M. Kerr, unpublished data. The hybrid murine fibroblast cell line SCC16-5, containing a single copy of human chromosome 21 encoding human IFNGR2, was used initially to characterize human IFNGR1 (49Janssen J.W. Collard J.G. Tulp A. Cox D. Millington-Ward A. Pearson P. Cytometry. 1986; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 50Jung V. Rashidbaigi A. Jones C. Tischfield J.A. Shows T.B. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4151-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The expression of various mutants of IFNGR1 in these cells revealed that Tyr440 is required for STAT1 activation and antiviral activity (29Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 51Farrar M.A. Campbell J.D. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11706-11710Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results, taken together, suggest that cellular backgrounds affect the nature of IFNGR1-dependent signals as well as the responses to IFNγ. When the Y440F mutant of human IFNGR1 was expressed in SCC16-5 cells, or when the Y419F mutant of mouse IFNGR1 was expressed in IFNGR1-null MEFs, substantial tyrosine phosphorylation of IFNGR1 in response to IFNγ was still observed (29Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The functions of the other phosphorylated tyrosine residues of IFNGR1 have not been investigated until now. Here we show that an important function of one of these residues is attenuation of IFNγ-dependent responses, which are stronger in IFNGR1-null MEFs expressing the 3F/419Y mutant than in cells expressing wild-type IFNGR1 (Figs. 1 and 3c). Stronger STAT1 activation in response to IFNγ was also observed in SCC16-5 cells expressing the 4F/440Y mutant, in which four of the five tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNGR1 were mutated to phenylalanines, than in cells with wild-type human IFNGR1 (data not shown). Moreover, Tyr441 is the primary residue that mediates this attenuation (Fig. 3). Therefore, IFNGR1 uses different tyrosine residues to provide activation and feedback inhibition signals. Mutant IFNGR1 constructs were made in a retroviral expression vector, and pools of IFNGR1-null cells were generated by infection, followed by selection with puromycin. By titering the viruses, relatively even expression of different mutant IFNGR1s was achieved, at levels matching that of IFNGR1 in wild-type cells (Fig. 2). We believe that it is advantageous to use stable pools of cells, allowing one to observe an average response and to avoid being misled by differences among different cell clones. Interaction of SOCS-1 and IFNGR1—Analyses of the mechanisms of the inhibitory effects of SOCS-1 have focused on the ability of SOCS-1 to bind to the active loop of JAKs, and interaction of SOCS-1 with the interleukin-2 receptor β chain has been shown not to be required for inhibitory effects (52Sporri B. Kovanen P.E. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Leonard W.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our results show that, in IFNγ-dependent signaling, constitutive overexpression of SOCS-1 partially inhibited JAK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4b), and this inhibition was observed only in cells retaining Tyr441 of IFNGR1. We were also able to show that SOCS-1 binds to IFNGR1 at Tyr441 in a ligand-dependent manner, presumably through an interaction between its SH2 domain and phospho-tyrosine 441, because tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation of Tyr441 abolishes the interaction (Fig. 5). These results, together with others in the literature, suggest that SOCS-1, like SOCS-3 (the most homologous member of the SOCS family) (53Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R.

Kinjyo I. Sasaki M. Johnston J.A. Yoshimura A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). How SOCS-1 Inhibits IFNγ-dependent Signaling—Studies in vitro have shown that SOCS-1 inhibits the kinase activity of JAK2, probably by binding to the active site loop (14Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 53Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar), and the binding of SOCS-1 may also target JAK2 for proteasome-dependent degradation (7Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Our results show that SOCS-1 binds to JAK2 only in cells expressing wild-type IFNGR1 or the 2F/441Y/419Y mutant and that mutation of Tyr441 completely abrogates the IFNγ-induced binding of SOCS-1 to IFNGR1 and JAK2 (Fig. 5). Consistently, in cells expressing the 3Y/441F or 3F/419Y mutant of IFNGR1, IFNγ-dependent signaling was prolonged, revealing that the interaction of SOCS-1 and Tyr441 of IFNGR1 is required for negative regulation. A likely scenario is that, in response to IFNγ, SOCS-1 expression is induced, and SOCS-1 is recruited to IFNGR1 through phospho-tyrosine 441, which brings it close enough to JAK2 to enable it to bind to the active site loop, thus inhibiting the kinase activity and possibly also catalyzing proteasome-mediated degradation of JAK2, leading to negative feedback of IFNγ-dependent signaling. However, the relatively small effect on JAK2 phosphorylation contrasts with the dramatic effect on STAT1 phosphorylation. Therefore, it seems likely that a second mechanism is more important in vivo, namely, the binding of SOCS-1 to Tyr441 of IFNGR1 blocks the access of STAT1 to Tyr419, thus preventing STAT1 activation.

Most plant cells are connected by plasmodesmata, forming multicellular “symplasmic domains” (1Van der Schoot C. Van Bel A.J.E. Planta. 1990; 182: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that allow exchange of small metabolites between cells. Transporters in the plasma membrane are required for transmembrane metabolite uptake into specific cell types, such as guard cells, pollen cells, and the sieve element/companion cell (SE/CC) complex that are symplasmically isolated. In addition, symplasmic domains of sink cells, for example, in fruit (2Zhang L.Y. Peng Y.B. Pelleschi-Travier S. Fan Y. Lu Y.F. Lu Y.M. Gao X.P. Shen Y.Y. Delrot S. Zhang D.P. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), require metabolite uptake transporters to support growth and development (for review, see Ref. 3Patrick J.W. Offler C.E. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 551-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, events such as wounding, dehiscence, or programmed cell death will release metabolites into the cell wall space, and it is expected that surrounding cells have the capability to take up the released compounds. Although not yet functionally characterized, specific sugar transporter homologs are expressed during senescence (4Quirino B.F. Reiter W.D. Amasino R.D. Plant Mol.

Arabidopsis encodes a wide array of metabolite transporters, around 100 potential metabolite transporters within the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) 1The abbreviations used are: MFS, major facilitator superfamily; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. alone. Available sequence data indicates that a similar situation exists in other plant species as well. Aside from the well characterized STP family of hexose transporters (8Williams L.E. Lemoine R. Sauer N. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), very little information is available concerning transport activity of plant MFS members. Within the MFS, Arabidopsis encodes three groups of transporters that are closely related to the inositol permeases ITR1 and ITR2 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (9Niederberger C. Graub R. Schweingruber A.M. Fankhauser H. Rusu M. Poitelea M. Edenharter L. Schweingruber M.E. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10Nikawa J. Tsukagoshi Y. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11184-11191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the xylose permease from Lactobacillus brevis (11Chaillou S. Bor Y.C. Batt C.A. Postma P.W. Pouwels P.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4720-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One group of four genes contains AtpGlcT (At5g16150), the plastidic glucose translocator (12Weber A. Servaites J.C. Geiger D.R. Kofler H. Hille D. Groner F. Hebbeker U. Flugge U.I. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A second group of four genes is most similar to the plant vacuolar inositol permeases (Mitr1 and Mitr2) first characterized from Mesembryanthemum (13Chauhan S. Forsthoefel N. Ran Y. Quigley F. Nelson D.E. Bohnert H.J. Plant J. 2000; 24: 511-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AtPLT5 (At3g18830) is a member of a third group of 6 genes that is most closely related to the celery mannitol permease AgMAT1 (14Noiraud N. Delrot S. Lemoine R. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the sorbitol permeases PcSOT1 and PcSOT2 from cherry fruit (15Gao Z. Maurousset L. Lemoine R. Yoo S.D. van Nocker S. Loescher W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and PmPLT1 and PmPLT2 from Plantago (16Ramsperger-Gleixner M. Geiger D. Hedrich R. Sauer N. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on localization data, these sugar alcohol permease homologs appear to have two main functions: 1) loading sugar alcohols into the phloem for long-distance transport (14Noiraud N. Delrot S. Lemoine R. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Ramsperger-Gleixner M. Geiger D. Hedrich R. Sauer N.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) uptake of sugar alcohols into sink cells. However, a detailed analysis of transport function has not been reported for any member of the family. AgMAT1 was expressed in yeast and demonstrated to transport mannitol (14Noiraud N. Delrot S. Lemoine R. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A number of sugar alcohols inhibited mannitol uptake as did glucose, indicating that potentially AgMAT1 also transports hexoses. Other homologs have only been tested for the ability to transport sugar alcohols (15Gao Z. Maurousset L. Lemoine R. Yoo S.D. van Nocker S. Loescher W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Ramsperger-Gleixner M. Geiger D. Hedrich R. Sauer N. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the substrate specificity of transporters in this family has remained in question. Whereas celery and Plantago are known to transport mannitol and sorbitol, respectively, in the phloem and sour cherry fruit accumulate sorbitol during ripening, Arabidopsis does not translocate or accumulate either sugar alcohol in significant quantities. Therefore, it is likely that the sugar alcohol permease homologs in Arabidopsis have different physiological roles than those proposed for homologous transporters in celery, Plantago, and sour cherry (14Noiraud N. Delrot S. Lemoine R. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Gao Z. Maurousset L. Lemoine R. Yoo S.D. van Nocker S. Loescher W.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning of AtPLT5 from Arabidopsis, expression in Xenopus oocytes, and the analysis of substrate specificity and transport kinetics by two-electrode voltage clamping. Results show that AtPLT5 transports a wide range of hexoses, pentoses, and sugar alcohols. AtPLT5 is expressed throughout the plant, especially in sink tissues, and is induced by mechanical wounding and insect feeding. It is likely that AtPLT5 functions as a nonspecific sugar uptake transporter in developing sinks and in cells surrounding wounded tissue. Cloning of AtPLT5—The entire coding region of AtPLT5 (At3g18830) was amplified by PCR using primers At3g18830-F (5′-ATGACAGGTGCCACACCGGAAAAC) and At3g18830-R (5′-CTACGAACTTTGTGTGTCTCCTTCC) using a cDNA library from Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 seedlings as template. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). Sequencing confirmed that there were no base pair changes between the PCR product and the predicted sequence from Col-0. For oocyte expression, AtPLT5 was cut out of pCR2.1-TOPO using EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of p002 (17von Ludewig U. Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), an expression vector containing Xenopus β-globin 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and a 92-bp poly(A) tail. This construct was linearized using PmaCI (Panvera), and 1 μg was used as template for cRNA synthesis using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocyte Expression—Xenopus laevis oocytes, stages V and VI, were isolated by incubation in 10 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Applied Science) in Barth's medium (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for 2–3 h until separated. The oocytes were then washed five times in 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in Barth's medium. The oocytes were injected with 50 nl (1 ng/nl) of AtPLT5 cRNA and incubated at 15 °C in Barth's medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml gentamycin. Electrophysiological experiments were performed 3–5 days following the RNA injection. Uptake experiments with radiolabeled substrates were performed 6 days after injection. Oocytes were incubated in Na-Ringer solution, pH 5.5, containing 14C-radiolabeled substrate (ICN) at a final concentration of 3.6 μm for 15 min at room temperature. To stop the reaction, oocytes were washed gently with 2 ml of Na-Ringer solution containing 1 mm of the corresponding unlabeled substrate. Oocytes were then lysed in 2% SDS for 30 min, the scintillation mixture was added, and the sample was counted. Electrophysiological Methods—Oocytes were bathed in Na-Ringer solution (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH as indicated in the figure legends, and 10 mm MgCl2) with continuous perfusion at 1 ml/min. Recording pipettes, filled with 1 m KCl, with resistances between 1.5 and 3 megaohms were used. Currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique with a Dagan TEV 200A amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Currents were filtered on line at 200 Hz and digitized at 2000 Hz using pClamp 5.5.1 (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA). The holding potential was -40 mV, and voltage pulses from -137 to 37 mV were applied for 200 ms. Steady-state currents are presented as the mean current between 160 and 190 ms following the onset of voltage pulses. Substrate-dependent currents were obtained by subtracting an average of background currents before and after substrate application. For Na+ substitution experiments, a modified Na-Ringer solution (115 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2,1 mm MgCl2,5 mm MES/Tris, pH 5.6) was used and an equimolar concentration of choline was substituted for Na+. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Analysis—RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis tissues using the RNeasy Plant RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For RT-PCR analysis the Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit was used with 100 ng of RNA per reaction. Primers for the detection of AtPLT5 expression were 5′-GACTTCTATCCTCCTTGGTTATGATATAGG (forward) and 5′-ATGACTGTTCCTCCTCGACACCTGAACG (reverse) and for the detection of the actin control 5′-GGAATGGTTAAGGCTGGATTTGCTGGAG (forward) and 5′-TTGCTATCCACATCTGTTGGAAGGTACT (reverse). For wounding experiments, inflorescence stems were cut into 5-mm pieces with a razor blade. The pieces were kept moist at room temperature until RNA was extracted at the times indicated in the legend to Fig. 9. Promoter GUS Fusion Constructs, Plant Transformation, and GUS Staining—For the analysis of the expression pattern of AtPLT5 a 2-kb promoter-GUS translational fusion was constructed. The promoter region was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 as template. The primers used were 5′-CACTAGGGCCAAATCGGCCCCACGAATTATGAAGGAAGCACT (forward) and 5′-GGTACCGGCCCTTATGGCCGTTCGGTTTTCCGGTGTGGCACC (reverse). They were designed to include SfiI restriction sites (underlined). The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The promoter fragment was cut out with SfiI and directionally cloned into the SfiI sites of the univector p713–909. 2T. Shigaki and K. D. Hirschi, unpublished data. The resulting construct was then recombined in vitro with the binary vector p713–905 using Cre recombinase. The resulting final construct consisted of the promoter region followed by the first 11 amino acids of AtPLT5 (MTGATPENRTA) in-frame with GUS. Restriction digest with EcoRI was used to detect the correct recombination product. Sequencing across the junction site confirmed the correct frame. Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants were transformed using the floral-dipping method (18Clough S. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by spraying seedlings with a 1:1000 diluted solution of Finale (equivalent to an active ingredient content of 0.12 g/liter glufosinate-ammonium, Farnam Companies, Phoenix, AZ). To detect GUS activity, plants were infiltrated with GUS-staining solution (1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-glucuronide, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. After staining, tissues were cleared with 70% (v/v) ethanol. For wounding experiments, attached rosette leaves were cut with scissors 24 h before infiltration with the staining solution. The Arabidopsis sugar alcohol permease homolog AtPLT5 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and analyzed by voltage clamping. At a holding potential of -40 mV several pentoses (arabinose, xylose, and ribose) and hexoses (l-rhamnose and d-fucose) induced inward currents (Fig. 1A) in AtPLT5-injected oocytes. This was the first indication that AtPLT5 could potentially transport a wide range of metabolites. Under the same recording conditions (pH 5.6 and a membrane potential of -40 mV), glucose-dependent inward currents averaged 66 ± 9 nA (mean ± S.E., n = 17 oocytes) and sorbitol-dependent inward currents averaged 48 ± 6 nA (n = 15 oocytes) over the course of the study that included 26 batches of oocytes from 13 different frogs. In contrast, maltose did not induce detectable currents and no currents were induced in uninjected control oocytes for any of the substrates tested (Fig. 1A). The inward currents generated by the application of uncharged substrates to the outside of the oocytes are consistent with a proton-coupled transport mechanism in which the coupling ion (proton) movement across the membrane is measured as an inward current. Substrate-dependent currents were inwardly directed at all membrane potentials from -137 to 37 mV and for all transported substrates. An example for glucose is given in Fig. 1B. Substrate-dependent currents were not voltage regulated: they were linear with membrane potential indicating that the transporter was not activated or inactivated by membrane potential. Kinetic analysis of sorbitol and glucose-dependent currents was performed using substrate concentrations between 50 μm and 30 mm. At both pH values tested, AtPLT5 showed a higher apparent affinity for glucose compared with sorbitol (Fig. 2). External pH values of 4.5 to 5.6 are considered to be within the physiological range for the extracellular pH of plant cells, and the affinity of AtPLT5 for sorbitol and glucose was strongly regulated within this range (compare Fig. 2, A versus B and C versus D). The K0.5 values of AtPLT5 for glucose and sorbitol were lower at pH 4.5 compared with pH 5.6 (Fig. 2). It was also clear that K0.5 values for sorbitol (Fig. 3A) and glucose (Fig. 3B) were not highly regulated by membrane potential at pH 4.5 or 5.6. At pH 5.6, K0.5 values for glucose were more voltage dependent than at pH 4.5 (Fig. 3B), however, this was not true for the K0.5 values for sorbitol that appear voltage independent at both pH values tested (Fig. 3A). Sorbitol- and glucose-induced currents through AtPLT5 were maximal at acidic external pH values (Fig. 4) although the effect of pH was not identical for the two substrates. At the most acidic pH tested (4.5), sorbitol produced higher current densities.Fig. 3Voltage dependence of substrate apparent affinity for AtPLT5 at pH 4.5 and 5.6.K0.5 values for sorbitol (A) and glucose (B) were measured at pH 4.5 and 5.6 for substrate concentrations between 50 μm and 30 mm.

Glucose and sorbitol-dependent currents (background currents subtracted) were recorded at a membrane potential of -98 mV, at 10 mm substrate concentrations in Na-Ringer solution adjusted to pH values between 4.5 and 7.5. All currents were normalized to currents recorded with 10 mm glucose at -79 mV, pH 5.6, for each oocyte. Data are presented as means of three observations ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Specific transporters within the MFS have been demonstrated to function as sensors, for example, on binding glucose, human SGLT3 forms a Na+-permeable channel and conducts Na+ but not glucose (19Diez-Sampedro A. Hirayama B.A. Osswald C. Gorboulev V. Baumgarten K. Volk C. Wright E.M. Koepsell H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11753-11758Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To determine whether the ion currents observed in oocytes when AtPLT5 was expressed were coupled to substrate uptake, 14C-labeled glucose, sorbitol, sucrose, or maltose were applied externally to oocytes. Oocytes expressing AtPLT5 accumulated both 14C-labeled glucose and sorbitol and did not accumulate 14C-labeled sucrose or maltose (Fig. 5A). In addition, more glucose was accumulated compared with sorbitol and this is consistent with lower sorbitol-induced inward currents compared with glucose-induced currents at pH 5.6 (Fig. 4). To determine whether sugar transport through AtPLT5 was coupled to Na+ or H+, experiments were performed in Na+-free Ringer solution (Na+ replaced by choline). Glucose-induced currents in Na-Ringer and choline-Ringer solutions were identical (Fig. 5B), consistent with a proton-coupled transport mechanism for AtPLT5. To obtain information on the substrate specificity of AtPLT5, the ability of 29 potential substrates to induce currents in AtPLT5-injected oocytes was tested. Substrates were applied at 10 mm concentrations in Na-Ringer solution at pH 5.6. At least 3 oocytes were recorded for each substrate and the currents were normalized to sorbitol-induced currents (Fig. 6). Several pentoses (ribose, d- and l-arabinose, and xylose) were transported at rates as high or higher than sorbitol. Several hexoses (glucose, mannose, galactose, fucose, l-rhamnose, and fructose) also served as good substrates. The tetrose erythrose was transported at a rate similar to sorbitol. The sugar alcohols erythritol, xylitol, and inositol as well as sorbitol were transported. Interestingly, glycerol also served as a substrate, whereas mannitol was not transported. None of the disaccharides tested (sucrose, cellobiose, lactose, maltose, and trehalose) were transported nor was the trisaccharide raffinose. The plant glucoside salicin was not transported nor was the glucosinolate sinigrin. α-Methylglucose was transported at a high rate indicating that α-glucosides can serve as substrates, however, glucosamine was not transported. The sugar acid glucuronate was transported at a low rate, whereas gluconate was not transported. The results indicate that AtPLT5 transports a wide range of monosaccharides and modified sugars. To characterize the apparent affinity of AtPLT5 for some of the additional substrates transported at high rates (Fig. 6), kinetic analysis was performed for the transport of d-ribose (a pentose) and d-fucose (a deoxy hexose) at pH 5.6. Ribose was transported with a similar apparent affinity as both sorbitol or glucose (Fig. 7A), whereas fucose was transported with lower affinity (Fig. 7C). K0.5 values for fucose and ribose were only slightly voltage dependent with lower values observed at more negative membrane potentials. Because fucose and ribose showed the highest transport rates of substrates tested (Fig. 6) and also the lowest (fucose) and highest (ribose) apparent affinities (Fig. 7), no correlation can be made between transport affinity and rate. To understand the function of a transporter it is necessary to know in which tissues it is expressed and whether expression is regulated or constitutive. A 2.0-kb promoter from the AtPLT5 gene was translationally fused to the GUS reporter gene and used to stably transform Arabidopsis plants (Col-0 ecotype). In seedlings, GUS expression was found in the root and in the vascular tissue of the cotyledons (Fig. 8, D and E). In older plants, expression in the root was predominantly observed in the cortex of the elongation zone (Fig. 8, B and C). This staining pattern was found both in the primary root and in lateral roots. No staining was observed at the root tip (Fig. 8B). In developmentally older parts of the root system no staining was observed. GUS expression was also found in the major vein of older, fully expanded leaves (Fig. 8A). In addition, expression was induced in leaves by mechanical wounding (Fig. 8, M and N) and by insect feeding (Fig. 8, O and P). During flowering, expression was found in a variety of tissues: the most rapidly elongating part of the floral stem (Fig. 8G), in the base and tip of anthers but not in pollen (Fig. 8L), in the style (Fig. 8H) and in the pedicel (Fig. 8, G and H). In developing fruit, expression was found at the base and tip of the silique (Fig. 8, I and J), in particular at the floral organ abscission zone (Fig. 8K) but not in seeds (Fig. 8, I and J). In later stages of silique development the staining at the tip end decreased (Fig. 8I). GUS expression was also induced at the site of wounding in the floral stem (Fig. 8R). During germination, GUS staining was noted in the seed coat (Fig. 8F). Tissue specificity of AtPLT5 expression was confirmed by RT-PCR. Expression was found in all tissues sampled and in inflorescence stem induction because wounding was found within 30 min (Fig. 9). The expression pattern is also consistent with publicly available microarray data (cbs.umn.edu/arabidopsis). Results of expression analyses indicate that AtPLT5 has a complex expression pattern. It is expressed in sink tissues that import sugars and other metabolites to support growth and development. In addition, AtPLT5 expression in tissue surrounding wounding sites and in the floral abscission zone indicates that it may function in recovery of sugars or metabolites in these tissues. In summary, the expression and transport activity data are consistent with a function as a broad-specificity proton-coupled sugar uptake transporter. Substrate Specificity—By expression in oocytes, the sorbitol permease homolog AtPLT5 was found to transport hexoses, pentoses, a tetrose, both acyclic and cyclic polyols, and an organic acid. The substrate specificity of homologs described from other plants may be equally broad, but previously published reports have concentrated on a small number of expected substrates. When AgMAT1 from celery was expressed in yeast, glucose was found to inhibit labeled mannitol uptake (20Noiraud N. Maurousset L. Lemoine R. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) indicating that glucose could compete for transport. In that study, glucose uptake could not be measured directly, possibly because of a high background of glucose transport in yeast. Similarly, glucose strongly inhibited sorbitol uptake into yeast cells expressing PcSOT1 from sour cherry. However, this inhibition was interpreted to be an artifact of heterologous expression in yeast and a high specificity for sorbitol was attributed to PcSOT1 (15Gao Z. Maurousset L. Lemoine R. Yoo S.D. van Nocker S. Loescher W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The analysis of AtPLT5 from Arabidopsis in this study indicated that transported substrates include a wide range of sugars and sugar alcohols. Many of the substrates transported by AtPLT5 are found in Arabidopsis: these are the sugar alcohols erythritol, glycerol, inositol, and the sugars erythrose, fructose, fucose, glucose, galactose, mannose, and rhamnose (21Fiehn O. Kopka J. Trethewey R.N. Willmitzer L. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 3573-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). All or some of these may therefore be substrates of AtPLT5 in planta. However, whereas it is possible that AtPLT5 functions in the plant to transport a wide array of sugars with moderate affinity as found for sorbitol, glucose, ribose, and fucose in this study, it cannot be excluded that AtPLT5 may have a higher affinity for a substrate not tested. All previously characterized Arabidopsis monosaccharide uptake transporters belong to the STP family of sugar transporters that are part of the MFS. AtPLT5 is in a distinct subfamily within the MFS. It is therefore the first transporter, outside of the STP family, shown to catalyze the cellular uptake of hexoses to be described from Arabidopsis. STP-type transporters studied to date include AtSTP1 (22Sauer N. Friedlander K. Graml-Wicke U. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3045-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 23Boorer K.J. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20417-20424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AtSTP2 (24Truernit E. Stadler R. Baier K. Sauer N. Plant J. 1999; 17: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), AtSTP3 (25Buttner M. Truernit E. Baier K. Scholz-Starke J. Sontheim M. Lauterbach C. Huss V.A.R. Sauer N. Plant Cell Environ. 2000; 23: 175-184Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), AtSTP4 (26Truernit E. Schmid J. Epple P. Illig J. Sauer N. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2169-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), AtSTP6 (27Schneidereit A. Scholz-Starke J. Buttner M. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and AtSTP9 (28Scholz-Starke J. Buttner M. Sauer N. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Except for AtSTP3, all are high affinity transporters with Km for glucose between 15 and 84 μm. AtPLT5 shares a number of features with members of the STP family such as 12 predicted transmembrane spans, proton-coupled transport mechanism, and a broad substrate specificity (23Boorer K.J. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20417-20424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, AtPLT5 shows interesting differences in its substrate selectivity compared with the STPs. d- and l-forms of arabinose were transported equally well by AtPLT5 (Fig. 6) indicating that IC and CI conformations are not distinguished. In contrast, AtSTP1 transports hexoses only in the CI conformation (23Boorer K.J. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20417-20424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For STP-type transporters, with the exception of STP6 in pollen, transport rates for fructose were typically less than 6% of the rate for glucose (22Sauer N. Friedlander K. Graml-Wicke U. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3045-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Truernit E. Stadler R. Baier K. Sauer N. Plant J. 1999; 17: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Buttner M. Truernit E. Baier K. Scholz-Starke J. Sontheim M. Lauterbach C. Huss V.A.R. Sauer N. Plant Cell Environ. 2000; 23: 175-184Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Scholz-Starke J. Buttner M. Sauer N. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This is interesting because the main carbohydrate delivered to sink cells via the phloem in most plants is sucrose, which is either transported directly into sink cells or is hydrolyzed in the wall space to yield fructose and glucose. The transport rate for fructose determined for AtPLT5 was 50% of the transport rate for glucose, indicating that AtPLT5 may function in the uptake fructose to a greater extent than the STPs. In plants a transmembrane proton gradient drives solute uptake through coupled transporters such as AtPLT5. Differences in pH optimum for glucose and sorbitol transport (Fig. 4) imply that external pH also regulates AtPLT5 and can influence substrate selectivity. The K0.5 for glucose and sorbitol were highly pH-dependent (Fig. 3) indicating that in addition to increasing the driving force for transport, extracellular acidification would increase AtPLT5 affinity, at least for sorbitol and glucose. Interestingly, AtPLT5 K0.5 values were only slightly voltage-dependent (Figs. 3 and 7). Localization of AtPLT5 and Function in the Plant—The sugar alcohol permease homologs PmPLT1 and PmPLT2 from Plantago were both localized to companion cells (16Ramsperger-Gleixner M. Geiger D. Hedrich R. Sauer N. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similarly, in celery AgMaT1 was been cloned from phloem tissue (20Noiraud N. Maurousset L. Lemoine R. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In both cases the expression of these transporters is consistent with a proposed role in phloem loading of sugar alcohols. In contrast, two sugar alcohol permease homologs, PcSOT1 and PcSOT2, were isolated from sour cherry fruit (15Gao Z. Maurousset L. Lemoine R. Yoo S.D. van Nocker S. Loescher W. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Their expression pattern is consistent with their predicted role in sorbitol uptake into sink tissue and with the fact that sour cherries contain large amounts of sorbitol when ripe. AtPLT5 expression was detected in sink tissues such as growing roots, developing siliques and anthers. In addition, expression was induced in older leaves, mainly along the midvein and also in wounded leaves and inflorescence stems. The expression pattern and substrate specificity of AtPLT5 indicate that it may play a role in providing sink tissues with a range of carbohydrates known to be present in the phloem (29Fiehn O. Phytochemistry. 2003; 62: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and assumed to be transported into sink cells. Rapidly expanding tissues, such as in the elongation zone in roots, are strong sinks for photoassimilates. The osmotic driving force necessary for phloem unloading could be generated via sucrose hydrolysis by invertase in the wall space, a process that would require subsequent hexose uptake into sink cells, or by sucrose cleavage within the sink cells. The parallel induced expression of cell wall invertase and a hexose transporter has been described for Chenopodium rubrum cultured cells (30Ehness R. Roitsch T. Plant J. 1997; 11: 539-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell wall invertase expression has been demonstrated in actively growing Arabidopsis roots (31Tymowska-Lalanne Z. Kreis M. Planta. 1998; 207: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study we found high AtPLT5 promoter-driven GUS activity in the elongation zone of the root (behind the root tip). In older parts of the root system the AtPLT5 promoter was not active except at the site of emerging lateral roots. AtPLT5 expression was not found at the root tip. Using green fluorescent protein as a marker, symplasmic phloem unloading through plasmodesmata was demonstrated in Arabidopsis root tips but not in the elongation zone (32Imlau A. Truernit E. Sauer N. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with sucrose hydrolysis in the wall space and subsequent hexose uptake via AtPLT5 as a mechanism for phloem unloading in the root elongation zone. AtPLT5 may also play a role in the reuptake of sugars from aging or damaged tissues as indicated by the induction of its expression in the floral abscission zone, in older leaves and in response to wounding. The floral abscission zone consists of distinct layers of cells located where the floral organs such as petals, sepals, and anthers are shed after fertilization has occurred (33Bleecker A.B. Patterson S.E. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). During the abscission process glucanases and chitinases are induced, the middle lamella is dissolved and the cells eventually separate (33Bleecker A.B. Patterson S.E. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 34Patterson S.E. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). AtPLT5 is strongly induced in the floral abscission zone after fertilization has taken place. It may therefore have a role in the re-uptake of sugars resulting from the activity of polysaccharide degrading enzymes. Senescing leaves are rich in sugars and other metabolites that are important for the plant to recover before the leaf eventually dies (33Bleecker A.B. Patterson S.E. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). AtPLT5 expression, visualized by GUS staining, was induced in cells surrounding the vascular tissue in the midvein in mature leaves. Visibly senescent leaves, on the other hand, did not show GUS activity. This suggests that AtPLT5 is active during early stages of senescence by recovering sugars leaking either out of the phloem or out of parenchyma cells surrounding the vascular tissue. In both cases AtPLT5 activity is likely to be important in supporting sugar export from the leaves without being directly involved in phloem loading. The strong increase in GUS staining after wounding indicates that AtPLT5 expression is rapidly induced under these circumstances. During wounding, oligosaccharides are released from the wounding site in two ways: 1) by mechanical destruction of the cell, followed by the discharge of the contents of the cell, and 2) by induction of endogenous polygalacturonases. Oligosaccharides released from wounding sites have been suggested to have a role in signaling, but aside from that they are also an important resource for the plant that needs to be recovered (35Bishop P.D. Makus D.J. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 36Leon J. Rojo E. Sanchez-Serrano J.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, invertases are also induced in wounded tissues, for instance, in wounded taproots of carrots (37Sturm A. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1107-1119PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes have the ability to hydrolyze sucrose and other β-fructose containing oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose (38Sturm A. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). As a broad specificity transporter, AtPLT5 may have an important role in recovery of a variety of sugars and sugar derivatives. Based on transport studies and the expression data we propose that sugar alcohol permease homologs in Arabidopsis are broad specificity transporters that most likely: 1) transport a range of substrates into sink cells, and 2) assist in scavenging sugars from senescing or dying tissue. There are five other members of this family in Arabidopsis that may have similarly broad substrate specificity. Publicly available expression data (cbs.umn.edu/arabidopsis) indicates that these other homologs may also play a role in import into sink tissues such as pollen (At2g16120, At2g16130, At2g18480, At2g20780), seeds (At2g18480, At4g36670), and seedlings (At4g36670). Whereas the apparent redundancy of hexose transporters may seem surprising, a similar situation occurs in the unicellular S. cerevisiae, which contains at least 18 genes encoding hexose transporters (39Wieczorke R. Krampe S. Weierstall T. Freidel K. Hollenberg C.P. Boles E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Additional work will be necessary to determine the precise function of all of the putative sugar transporters in Arabidopsis. We thank Drs. Toshiro Shigaki and Kendal D.

https://openalex.org/W2032724791,"Uptake of siderophores and vitamin B12 through the outer membrane of Escherichia coli is effected by an active transport system consisting of several outer membrane receptors and a protein complex of the inner membrane. The link between these is TonB, a protein associated with the cytoplasmic membrane, which forms a large periplasmic domain capable of interacting with several outer membrane receptors, e.g. FhuA, FecA, and FepA for siderophores and BtuB for vitamin B12. The active transport across the outer membrane is driven by the chemiosmotic gradient of the inner membrane and is mediated by the TonB protein. The receptor-binding domain of TonB appears to be formed by a highly conserved C-terminal amino acid sequence of ∼100 residues. Crystal structures of two C-terminal TonB fragments composed of 85 (TonB-85) and 77 (TonB-77) amino acid residues, respectively, have been previously determined (Chang, C., Mooser, A., Pluckthun, A., and Wlodawer, A.

In both cases the TonB fragments form dimers in solution and crystallize as dimers consisting of monomers tightly engaged with one another by the exchange of a β-hairpin and a C-terminal β-strand. Here we present the crystal structure of a 92-residue fragment of TonB (TonB-92), which is monomeric in solution. The structure, determined at 1.13-Å resolution, shows a dimer with considerably reduced intermolecular interaction compared with the other known TonB structures, in particular lacking the β-hairpin exchange.

The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria consists of two lipid bilayers, the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane with the peptidoglycan layer in between. A number of different transport pathways regulate the uptake of essential compounds into the cell. Most substances are translocated through the outer membrane by diffusion porins using a concentration gradient. However, substances occurring at very low concentrations like iron siderophores and vitamin B12 use specific, active, high affinity uptake systems that are driven by chemiosmotic energy transduced to the outer membrane by the TonB protein (1Hannavy K.

All of them share the same basic architecture, a 22-strand antiparallel β-barrel, which is partially filled with an N-terminal globular domain (also called plug or cork domain). The ligand binding site is exposed to the external medium, whereas the TonB binding site is located at the periplasmic side of the receptor. A peptide motif near the N terminus is conserved among all TonB-dependent receptors: D7TITV in FhuA, D12TIVV in FepA, D81ALTV in FecA, and D6TLVV in BtuB. This conserved region is called the “TonB box” (7Heller K. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 904-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Larsen R.A. Foster-Hartnett D. McIntosh M.A. Postle K. J.

Infection of Escherichia coli by bacteriophages T1 and φ80 and uptake of bacterial toxins (Colicins M and Ia and Microcin 25) also occurs in a TonB-dependent manner, and TonB box motifs are found in these colicins. Binding of the ligand to TonB-dependent receptors induces conformational changes of the cork domain. In the case of the receptor FhuA the unwinding of a short α-helix, which directly follows the TonB box and is exposed to the periplasm (the so-called “switch-helix”), was observed (2Ferguson A.D. Hoffmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 3Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.

Biol. 2003; 10: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The relocation of the switch-helix likely changes the position and accessibility of the TonB box on the periplasmic side of the receptor (6Chimento D.P. Mohanty A.K. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Merianos H.J. Cadieux N. Lin C.H. Kadner R.J. Cafiso D.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These allosteric conformational transitions, propagated from the ligand binding site to the periplasmic side, may serve to signal the ligand-loaded state of the receptor. The TonB-dependent transporters receive their energy from the chemiosmotic gradient of the cytoplasmic membrane mediated by an inner membrane protein complex composed of ExbB, ExbD, and TonB (11Bradbeer C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3146-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol.

The TonB protein of E. coli is composed of 239 amino acid residues and can be divided into three domains. A hydrophobic region at the N terminus (residues 1–32) anchors the TonB protein to the cytoplasmic membrane (14Postle K. Skare J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11000-11007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 12–32 are predicted to assume an α-helical conformation, which contains four highly conserved residues, the so-called “SHLS-motif,” which was found to be essential for the interaction with the integral membrane protein ExbB (15Larsen R.A. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8111-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain is followed by a periplasmic part with high proline content and a conserved C-terminal domain, each composed of ∼100 amino acid residues. 17% of the TonB sequence are proline residues; most of them are located between residues 75 and 107 (16Evans J.S. Levine B.A. Trayer I.P. Dorman C.J. Higgins C.F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Moeck G.S. Letellier L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2755-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Several observations indicate that the C-terminal domain of TonB (approximately residues 148–239) interacts directly with the TonB-dependent receptors, particularly with their TonB box (18Heller K. Kadner R.J. Günter K. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 64: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 19Günter K. Braun V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Synthetic nonapeptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of TonB between residues 155 and 166 were found to be able to inhibit FhuA-dependent transport of ferrichrome in vivo (20Killmann H. Herrmann C. Torun A. Jung G. Braun V. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3497-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Complex formation between the C-terminal domain of TonB and the outer membrane receptors FhuA or FepA, respectively, has also been demonstrated by co-purification (17Moeck G.S. Letellier L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2755-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Koedding J. Howard S.P. Kaufmann L. Polzer P. Lustig A. Welte W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9978-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and disulfide cross-linking was demonstrated between cysteine substitutions in the Q160 region of TonB and the TonB box of BtuB (9Cadieux N. Kadner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and FecA (22Ogierman M. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1870-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently the three-dimensional crystal structures of two C-terminal TonB fragments were reported. One of the fragments is composed of the C-terminal 85 amino acid residues of TonB from E. coli (“TonB-85,” residues 155–239 (23Chang C. Mooser A. Pluckthun A. Wlodawer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27535-27540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)). The other fragment is composed of the C-terminal 77 amino acid residues (“TonB-77,” residues 163–239 (21Koedding J. Howard S.P. Kaufmann L. Polzer P. Lustig A. Welte W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9978-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). Both atomic models contain only residues 165–238, because the eight additional N-terminal residues of TonB-85 are disordered and cannot be identified in the electron density map. Apart from that the two structures are virtually identical and show two molecules tightly engaged with one another as an intertwined dimer. Each molecule forms three β-strands and a short α-helix in the order β-β-α-β. The dimer is stabilized by the exchange of the first two β-strands, which form a β-hairpin. The arrangement of the β-strands in the dimer thus leads to a large 6-strand antiparallel β-sheet. The finding that the C-terminal 77 residues of TonB crystallized as a dimer has led to models in which a dimer of native TonB may respond to occupied high affinity receptors, possibly by rotating (23Chang C. Mooser A. Pluckthun A. Wlodawer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27535-27540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Other recent results have indicated that the situation may be more complicated, however. In a study of C-terminal TonB fragments of increasing length (from 77 to 126 residues), it was found that fragments of 85 residues and shorter formed homodimers in solution, whereas the longer fragments were monomeric (21Koedding J. Howard S.P. Kaufmann L. Polzer P. Lustig A. Welte W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9978-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, the shortest fragment with 77 residues (which lacked glutamines 160 and 162) was unable to bind to FhuA, whereas the longer ones (which contained the glutamines) formed a complex with it as determined by gel filtration studies and could inhibit the function of native TonB when produced in vivo. Furthermore, in a recent analytical ultracentrifugation and surface plasmon resonance study (24Khursigara C.M. De Crescenzo G. Pawelek P.D. Coulton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7405-7412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it was found that His-tagged C-terminal fragments of 85 and 208 residues both bind to FhuA, with the shorter fragment binding as a dimer. In the absence of FhuA the longer fragment that comprises the entire periplasmic part of TonB was monomeric, whereas in the presence of FhuA there were heterotrimers composed of one receptor and two fragments. The three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal domain of TolA that belongs to the related TolQ/R/A system was recently reported alone for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa TolA (25Witty M. Sanz C. Shah A. Grossmann J.G. Mizuguchi K. Perham R.N. Luisi B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in complex with the bacteriophage coat protein g3p for the E. coli TolA (26Lubkowski J. Hennecke F. Plückthun A. Wlodawer A. Structure. 1999; 7: 711-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Despite an insignificant sequence identity (20%) between these two TolA proteins, their structures are remarkably similar. They both crystallize as monomers and consist of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by four α-helices positioned on one side of the β-sheet. A structure-based alignment of the C-terminal domains of TolA from P. aeruginosa with TonB from E. coli results in an amino acid sequence identity of only 18% (25Witty M. Sanz C. Shah A. Grossmann J.G. Mizuguchi K. Perham R.N. Luisi B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although TolA shares the secondary structure pattern β1-β2-α-β3 with TonB-77 and TonB-85, it lacks the β1-β2 hairpin exchange observed in the structure of TonB-77 and TonB-85 that enables the formation of a stable dimer. Herein we report the crystal structure of a new C-terminal fragment of TonB from E. coli at 1.13-Å resolution. TonB-92 contains the C-terminal 92 amino acid residues of TonB, being only 7 residues longer than TonB-85. Its three-dimensional structure, however, differs significantly from those of TonB-85 and TonB-77, and more closely resembles that of TolA, because of the absence of the β1-β2 hairpin exchange. In combination with recent results demonstrating that the longer TonB fragments are able to interact with FhuA more effectively and inhibit native TonB function in vivo, while the shorter fragments do not, these results cast new light on the question whether TonB in vivo functions as a monomer or a dimer. Protein Expression and Purification—TonB-92, a C-terminal fragment containing the last 92 amino acid residues of the TonB protein of E. coli, was overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmid pTB92 and was subsequently purified to near homogeneity (21Koedding J. Howard S.P. Kaufmann L. Polzer P. Lustig A. Welte W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9978-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Purification of the SeMet 1The abbreviations used are: SeMet, selenomethionine; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry.-TonB-92 was performed according to the protocol for the native TonB-92 with the following exceptions: cells were grown in M63 minimal medium (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 218-220Google Scholar) to an A600 of 0.6, and a selected set of amino acids was then added to a medium containing lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine at a concentration of 100 mg/liter; leucine, isoleucine, and valine at 50 mg/liter; and selenomethionine at 60 mg/liter. 15 Min later, 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to start the overexpression of SeMet-TonB-92. Purified SeMet-TonB-92 was concentrated in a 5-kDa filter (Vivaspin), and the flow-through was discarded. The final yield was 1 mg of SeMet-TonB-92 per liter of culture. For crystallization, SeMet-TonB-92 was used at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization and data collection of native TonB-92 at 1.08-Å resolution has been described elsewhere (28Koedding J. Polzer P. Killig F. Howard S.P. Gerber K. Seige P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1281-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Crystals of selenomethionine-substituted TonB-92 were grown in 100 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 1.1 m sodium citrate, and 100 mm sodium chloride using the hanging-drop method. The crystallization drop contained 3 μl of protein solution and 3 μl of reservoir solution. For x-ray data collection the crystal was flash frozen at 100 K using reservoir solution supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. SeMet data were collected at the Swiss Light Source beamline X06SA to 2.0-Å resolution and measured at three wavelengths corresponding to the peak, inflection, and remote high wavelength of selenium. The data were processed using XDS (29Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are listed in Table I.

Four heavy atom sites were identified by using SOLVE (30Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), corresponding to two methionines in the TonB-92 amino acid sequence and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Initial protein phases were calculated by using SOLVE. These phases were further improved by solvent flattening with RESOLVE (31Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 32Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 59: 34-44PubMed Google Scholar) leading to a first polyalanine model of TonB-92 with 123 amino acid residues out of 184. The program also modeled the side chains of 50 amino acid residues. Because of the small number of heavy atoms, non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) could not be determined from the heavy atom sites. For finding the NCS, a program 2K. Diederichs, unpublished work.. was used that identified regions with 2-fold NCS from the available main-chain fragments. Three corresponding Cα atoms from each NCS region were chosen to generate a new pseudo-heavy atom coordinate file for input to RESOLVE. In the next run, RESOLVE found the 2-fold NCS in the pseudo-heavy atom sites and used it for phase improvement, leading to a new polyalanine model with 140 amino acid residues (76% of total residues). At this time 69 side chains were modeled correctly. The resulting electron density maps were taken for further manual model building using the programs O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) and COOT (34Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23370) Google Scholar). This model was refined against the high resolution data of the native TonB-92 using REFMAC5 (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13868) Google Scholar), which is part of the CCP4 program package (36Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19765) Google Scholar). The structure was subsequently refined with SHELXL (37Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). After modeling 198 water molecules and adding all hydrogen atoms, the last anisotropic refinement resulted in a final R-factor of 13.4% (Rfree, 18.5%). Refinement statistics are presented in Table I. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 1U07. Dynamic Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering experiments with purified TonB-92 were carried out using a DynaPro MS-16–830 instrument from Proterion Corp., High Wycombe, UK. The sample volume was 12 μl of protein solution at 2 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris at pH 8.5 and 100 mm NaCl. Each sample was filtered through a 0.02-μm pore filter (Whatman) before measurement. The time-dependent intensity signal of the scattered light was evaluated with the program Dynamics Version 6. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Experiments were performed on a Beckman XL-A Optima analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an AN 60-Ti rotor 316 and an optical absorbance system. All experiments were done at 20 °C with freshly prepared solution of TonB-92 at 2 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris pH 8.5 containing 100 mm NaCl. The protein was finally purified by gel-permeation chromatography. In sedimentation velocity experiments absorption was scanned 86 min after the rotor reached the top speed of 52,000 rpm. Results of sedimentation equilibrium were obtained at protein concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2 mg/ml, respectively. At a rotor speed of 34,000 rpm, equilibrium was achieved after 20 h. Data were analyzed using the software SEGAL 2.1. 3See www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/personal/jseelig/AUC/software00.html. In vitro binding experiments of TonB-92 to ferrichrome-loaded FhuA were done as previously described for other C-terminal TonB-fragments (21Koedding J. Howard S.P. Kaufmann L. Polzer P. Lustig A. Welte W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9978-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment of TonB from E. coli containing 92 amino acid residues (“TonB-92,” residues 148–239) was solved at 1.13-Å resolution. Because this fragment contains two methionine residues, we were able to gain phase information by the selenomethionine substitution method (see “Experimental Procedures”). The structure refinement with SHELXL resulted in a well defined model of both chains (called “a” and “b” in the following) of TonB-92 in the asymmetric unit with an R-factor of 13.4% and an Rfree of 18.5% (Fig. 1). All amino acid residues except the first two N-terminal residues of the a-chain and the first four N-terminal residues of the b-chain were clearly visible in the electron density map. Description of Experimental Structure—The overall size of the molecule is ∼50 Å by 20 Å by 20 Å. The structure of TonB-92 presents secondary structure elements in the order of α*-β1-β2-α-β3 (Fig. 2). Strands β1, β2, and β3 associate to a three-stranded β-sheet. The C-terminal strand β3 is longer than β1 or β2 and interacts with the corresponding part of a second TonB-92 molecule by forming an intermolecular antiparallel β-sheet. Dimerization leads to a non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (Fig. 1). Near the N terminus a segment of eleven residues (“ES1,” Arg154-Pro164) containing the Gln160 region possesses backbone conformation close to β-sheet except for one residue, Leu156. A short helix (“α*”) formed by six residues (Ala165-Leu170) follows which is part of a loop reversing the direction of the main chain. It is followed by a type I β-hairpin composed of β1 (residues Gly174-Val182) and β2 (residues Asp189-Lys197). The three residues PDG (Pro184-Asp185-Gly186) at the tip of the hairpin are a conserved motif for the Ton-B family and are a frequent sequence in three-residue β-hairpins (39Gunasekaran K. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. Prot. Engineer. 1997; 10: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which confer high turn stability even in peptides (40Blandl T. Cochran A.G. Skelton N.J. Prot. Sci. 2003; 12: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After a further turn, helix α (residues Glu203-Met210) and another segment with conformation close to β-sheet (“ES2,” Trp213-Glu216), which is apposed to part of ES1 (Arg154-Arg158) follow. Surprisingly only four hydrogen bonds of this interaction stabilize the conformation of ES1: the main chains of Arg154, Leu156, and Ser157 form hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Arg214 and Glu216 (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the electron density of residues in ES1 is well defined (Fig. 4), and their B-factors do not deviate from the average value. After β2, the main-chain again changes direction and forms the long C-terminal strand β3 (Pro220-Thr236). β3 protrudes out of the domain by about 8 residues and associates with an antiparallel β3′ of another molecule resulting in an intermolecular β-sheet β3-β3′.Fig. 4Electron density map (2mFo - DFc) at 3σ (dark blue) and at 2σ (light blue) around amino acid residue Gln160 of ES1. The side-chains of Asn159 and Gln162 show multiple conformations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comparison with Crystal Structures of Tonb-77 and Tonb-85—In the following, the crystal structure of TonB-92 will be compared with that shared by TonB-77 and TonB-85. The common structure of the latter two fragments contains the residues 165–238 and will be referred to as the “tight dimer.” A superposition of one molecule from the crystal structure of TonB-92 and one from the tight dimer (Fig. 5) and their secondary structure assignments (Fig. 6) show that the secondary structure elements β1, β2, α, and β3 are formed and arranged similarly in both structures. In the tight dimer, the two molecules are engaged by exchanging their β1-β2 hairpins with one another resulting in the formation of a six-stranded intermolecular antiparallel β-sheet (see Fig. 5 of Ref. 21Koedding J. Howard S.P. Kaufmann L. Polzer P. Lustig A. Welte W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9978-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the TonB-92 structure the β1-β2 hairpin does not exchange with another molecule but rather takes up the same place that is filled in the tight dimer with the β1′-β2′ hairpin from the other molecule. As seen in Fig. 5, the orientation of the β-hairpin of TonB-92 and of the tight dimer can be superimposed onto each other very well. The comparison shows that the TonB chain has additional flexibility that is not obvious from the tight dimer structure and that results in two hinges before and after the β1-β2 hairpin. The backfolding of the β-hairpin weakens the monomer-monomer interaction and leads to both a reduced length of β1 in TonB-92 and the formation of a new helix α* (Fig. 6). Strand β1 of the tight dimer starts with the residues Ala169, Leu170, and Arg171, whereas in case of TonB-92 these residues are part of the helix α*. The presence of seven additional N-terminal residues of TonB-92 as compared with TonB-85 thus seems to abolish the β1-β2 exchange leading to a remarkably different crystal structure but retaining the basic arrangement of the secondary structure elements β1, β2, α, and β3 (see Figs. 5 and 6). In the tight dimer of TonB-85, 10 N-terminal residues (Ala155-Pro1"

This apparent discrepancy in topA requirements in different bacteria prompted us to reexamine the topA requirements in E. coli. We find that E. coli strains bearing topA mutations, introduced into the strains by DNA-mediated gene replacement, are viable at 37 or 42 °C without any compensatory mutations. These topA- cells exhibit cold sensitivity in their growth, however, and this cold sensitivity phenotype appears to be caused by excessive negative supercoiling of intracellular DNA. In agreement with previous results (Zhu, Q., Pongpech, P., and DiGate, R. J. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The type IA subfamily of DNA topoisomerases, some of the extensively studied examples are E. coli DNA topoisomerases I and III, yeast DNA topoisomerase III, Drosophila, and mammalian DNA topoisomerases IIIα and IIIβ, are found in all living organisms (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 3Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). This universal presence suggests a key cellular role of these enzymes that cannot be fulfilled by either the type IB or type II subfamily of DNA topoisomerases. In support of this notion, the viability is compromised upon inactivation of both type IA enzymes of Escherichia coli (4Zhu Q. Pongpech P. DiGate R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9766-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or inactivation of the sole type IA enzyme of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (5Goodwin A. Wang S.W. Toda T. Norbury C.

For the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Δtop3 cells lacking DNA topoisomerase III are viable, but they exhibit a complex phenotype including slow growth, high level of recombination, high sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, and inability to produce viable spores (7Wallis J.W.

Hsieh, personal communication. inactivation of DNA topoisomerase IIIα leads to embryonic lethality. Whereas viability and development of both mouse and Drosophila appear normal in the absence of DNA topoisomerase IIIβ (12Kwan K.Y. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5717-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Wilson T.M. Chen A.D. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), mice lacking this enzyme exhibit a shortened life span and reduced fecundity and develop inflammatory responses in multiple organs (12Kwan K.Y.

A. 2003; 100: 2526-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Insight into the molecular roles of the type IA enzymes came mostly from studies of microorganisms (reviewed in Refs. 1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 3Champoux J.J.

For the two E. coli enzymes, there is strong biochemical and genetic evidence that DNA topoisomerase I has a major role in the preferential removal of negative supercoils in intracellular DNA, especially in regions behind the transcribing assemblies tracking along DNA (15Tse-Dinh Y.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 17Wang J.C. Lynch A.S.

In an in vitro plasmid replication system, DNA topoisomerase III but not I was shown to support the unlinking of the parental DNA strands to yield separate progeny DNA rings (20Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32655-32659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implicating a role of DNA topoisomerase III in unlinking of DNA strands during replication (20Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32655-32659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli ΔtopB mutants lacking DNA topoisomerase III exhibit no growth defect (21Schofield M.A. Agbunag R. Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5168-5170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, and thus it appears that copying the parental strands might precede their complete unraveling, so that the plectonemically wound parental strands could be converted to a pair of intertwined double helices for decatenation by a type II DNA topoisomerase (22Sundin O. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1981; 25: 659-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). That the two E. coli type IA enzymes appear to play distinct cellular roles does not preclude the possibility, however, that they may also share a common function. In the yeasts, mutations in a number of genes involved in homologous recombination were shown to suppress the phenotype of yeast Δtop3 mutants, implicating a role of the topoisomerase in the resolution of a structure or structures formed in homologous recombination (23Shor E. Gangloff S. Wagner M. Weinstein J. Price G. Rothstein R. Genetics. 2002; 162: 647-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Oakley T.J. Goodwin A. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 463-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The growth defect of an E. coli topA topB double mutant was also reported to be suppressed by an additional mutation in recA, a key gene in homologous recombination (4Zhu Q. Pongpech P. DiGate R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9766-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on a comparison of the mechanisms of different subfamilies of DNA topoisomerases, it has been suggested that a candidate for such a structure might be the double Holliday junction (2Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 14Kwan K.Y. Moens P.B. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2526-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast to the dispensability of E. coli DNA topoisomerase III in terms of cell viability (21Schofield M.A. Agbunag R. Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5168-5170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inactivation of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I was generally thought to be lethal. Shortly after the identification of a set of viable E. coli ΔtopA mutants (25Sternglanz R. DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Nishimura Y. Hirota Y. Becherer K. Zumstein L. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2747-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), it was found that the ΔtopA locus of these mutants could not be readily transduced into strain PLK831 (ΔtrpE63 pyrF287 nirA trpR72 iclR7 gal25 rpsL195) by phage P1 (26DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 27Pruss G.J. Manes S.H. Drlica K. Cell. 1982; 31: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The same recipient strain became more easily transduced, however, if it had acquired a compensatory change within certain regions of the E. coli chromosome, including gyrA and gyrB, which encode the two subunits of gyrase, and a region containing tolC, which encodes an outer membrane transporter (26DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 27Pruss G.J. Manes S.H. Drlica K. Cell. 1982; 31: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 28Trucksis M. Golub E.I. Zabel D.J. Depew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Raji A. Zabel D.J. Laufer C.S. Depew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that ΔtopA is lethal in the absence of compensatory genetic changes. A more direct demonstration of the lethality of topA deletion was provided by experiments demonstrating the thermal sensitivity of E. coli topA amber mutants expressing a thermal sensitive amber suppressor. Presumably, suppression of the amber codon at a permissive temperature would provide an adequate level of DNA topoisomerase I, but inactivation of the suppressor at 42 °C would abolish the synthesis of a functional DNA topoisomerase I and, consequently, cell growth (30Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Dorman C.J. Lynch A.S. Bhriain N.N. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The idea that the topA gene is essential for cell growth was not reinforced, however, by studies in Salmonella typhimurium, a bacterium closely related to E. coli. Early studies indicated that null mutations in an S. typhimurium gene termed supX, which was later shown to be identical to topA (28Trucksis M. Golub E.I. Zabel D.J. Depew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Margolin P. Zumstein L. Sternglanz R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5437-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), led to no lethal effects; there was no indication that viability of these topA cells depended on the presence of a compensatory mutation (33Dubnau E. Lenny A.B. Margolin P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Richardson S.M. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). More recently, Shigella flexneri topA null mutants were also found to be viable without apparent compensatory mutations (35Bhriain N.N. Dorman C.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus there appears to be a difference in topA requirement in different bacteria; it is this apparent difference that prompted us to reexamine the viability of E. coli mutants lacking DNA topoisomerase I. Targeted Gene Replacement and Phage P1 Transduction—The vector pRM4-N for gene replacement in E. coli by chi-stimulated homologous recombination (40Dabert P. Smith G.R. Genetics. 1997; 145: 877-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. G. Smith (University of Washington). In this plasmid, a multiple cloning site is placed in between two triplets of chi sequences. DNA segments derived from a 12.1-kb SalI-HindIII fragment containing the E. coli cysB-topA-trpE region (42Wang J.C. Becherer K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1773-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were placed within the multiple cloning site according to routine cloning manipulations (see “Results” for a description of the three classes of derivatives, all of which have a chloramphenicol resistance marker inserted at a unique SphI site of the 12.1-kb segment). The chloramphenicol resistance marker cam was amplified from pACYC184 (supplied by New England Biolabs) by PCR in the presence of primers that would add SphI sites to both ends of a 1.41-kb DNA product; the inducible lac promoter used in the construction of one class of derivatives was obtained from pJW312 as a HindIII-EcoRI fragment (30Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Codon substitutions within the topA region were done by replacing appropriate DNA segments by the corresponding segments containing the alterations L5F C662H (36Zhu C.X. Qi H.Y. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or G65N W79S (37Wang Y. Lynch A.S. Chen S.J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1203-1209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Various pRM4-N derivatives were linearized by digestion with NotI. The large linear DNA segments lacking the replication origin of pRM4-N were purified by gel electrophoresis and used for gene replacement in the cysB-topA-trpE region of the E. coli chromosome, through homologous recombination mediated by recBCD, as described by Dabert and Smith (40Dabert P. Smith G.R. Genetics. 1997; 145: 877-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or the phage λ Red recombination system, as described by Datsenko and Wanner (41Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the thermal sensitive plasmid expressing the λ Red functions γ, β, and exo, pKD46, was kindly provided by Dr. B. L. Wanner (Purdue University). cam+ colonies were first selected in these experiments, and several tests were utilized to ascertain the incorporation of the expected changes in chromosomal DNA samples extracted from selected colonies. For mutants in which the topA promoter was replaced by a lac promoter, or mutants in which a large topA segment was deleted, amplification of these shortened regions by PCR was carried out to confirm the presence of these altered regions and the absence of the corresponding wild-type segments. Appropriate restriction digests were also analyzed by Southern blot hybridization for the presence of the cam marker and other changes, taking advantage of alterations in restriction sites in the G65N W79S mutants (37Wang Y. Lynch A.S. Chen S.J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1203-1209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In all cases, the selected cam+ colonies were found to have correctly incorporated the intended changes in the topA region. Transduction by phage P1vir was carried out according to the protocol described by Silhavy (51Silhavy T.J. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 107-112Google Scholar), using a phage stock kindly provided by Dr. N. Kleckner (Harvard University). Analysis of Plasmid Linking Number Distributions—Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis and the use of Southern blot hybridization to monitor plasmid supercoiling were carried out as described previously (43Stupina V.A. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8608-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Construction of E. coli topA Conditional Mutants by DNA-mediated Gene Replacement—The introduction of methods for DNA-mediated gene targeting in E. coli has made it possible to construct better defined E. coli topA mutants. In order to minimize the possibility of inadvertently acquiring compensatory mutations in these mutants, conditional topA mutants were first constructed under permissive conditions that produced a functional mutant DNA topoisomerase I. Fig. 1 depicts the common features of the cloned DNA segments used for gene replacements in the topA region of the E. coli chromosome. A cam gene encoding chloramphenicol resistance was first inserted at an SphI site within a cloned 12.1-kb SalI-HindIII fragment. This insertion does not disrupt any of the open reading frames in the topA region; to minimize plausible interference with topA expression, cam transcription was also chosen to be directing away rather than into topA. Two classes of conditional topA mutants were constructed. The first class, topA ts (L5F C662H) and topA ts (G65N W79S), encodes two thermal sensitive DNA topoisomerase I with the indicated point mutations L5F C662H and G65N W79S, respectively. The L5F C662H mutant was derived from site-directed mutagenesis of individual codons of cysteinyl residues that are involved in Zn(II) binding (36Zhu C.X. Qi H.Y. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mutation C662H was found to give a thermal sensitive enzyme (36Zhu C.X. Qi H.Y. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and sequencing of the mutant gene revealed the presence of a second mutation L5F in the gene, which by itself had little effect on enzyme activity. 2Y. Wang and J. C. Wang, unpublished data. The (G65N W79S) mutant was expected to produce the same mutant DNA topoisomerase I of E. coli topA strain AS17, which harbors a supD amber suppressor (30Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Dorman C.J. Lynch A.S. Bhriain N.N. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The topA gene of strain AS17 has a G65N mutation and an amber codon instead of Trp-79 of wild-type topA (37Wang Y. Lynch A.S. Chen S.J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1203-1209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Originally, it was thought that the thermal sensitivity of the supD suppressor in this strain, which would incorporate a serine at the amber codon only at a permissive temperature (38Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 459-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was responsible for the topA ts phenotype of AS17. Recent evidence indicates, however, that the protein product in the presence of the suppressor, with amino acid changes G65N and W79S relative to the wild-type protein, is itself thermal sensitive (37Wang Y. Lynch A.S. Chen S.J. Wang J.C. J. Biol.

(the region replaced by the lac promoter is indicated by an X in Fig. 1). An additional DNA segment bearing the mutation Plac-topA (L5F), which encodes a protein with wild-type DNA topoisomerase I activity, was also used in the construction of a control. As will be described later, several mutants with the deletion of a large region in the topA region, marked by Y in Fig. 1, were also made in the later stages of the present study. Viability of E. coli topA Mutants Expressing a Thermally Sensitive DNA Topoisomerase I—Replacement of the chromosomal topA region by topA ts (L5F C662H) or topA ts (G65N W79S), using either the chi site-dependent homologous recombination method (40Dabert P.

Transfected cell cultures were incubated at 30 °C in these experiments, except that in experiments using the λ Red recombination system the cultures were kept at 37 °C for 1 h following transfection to eliminate the thermal sensitive plasmid pKD46 bearing the λ Red genes.Table ILists of E. coli strains used in this study Listed are the strains previously reported.StrainGenotypeSource or Ref.AB1369DE(gpt-proA)62 lacY1 tsx-29 glnV44(AS) galK2(Oc) LAM- cysB38 Rac-0 hisG4(Oc) rfbD1 kdgK51 xylA5 mtl-1 argE3(Oc) thi-1A.

Surprisingly, the two topA ts derivatives of either AB1369 or MG1655 grew as well as their parent cells on agar plates at either 30 or 42 °C. To test whether DNA topoisomerase I expressed in these topA ts mutants is indeed thermal sensitive, strain AB1369 topA ts (L5F C662H) was transformed with a tetA-bearing plasmid pVS1 (43Stupina V.A. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8608-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a plasmid that has been shown to be excessively negatively supercoiled (“hypernegatively supercoiled”) in cells lacking DNA topoisomerase I (43Stupina V.A. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8608-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Plasmid samples were recovered from a randomly selected transformant grown at 30 or 42 °C. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of these samples showed that the degree of negative supercoiling of the plasmid is much higher at the higher temperature (Fig. 2). Thus it appeared that these cells indeed had a much reduced level of DNA topoisomerase I at 42 °C, but despite this deficiency they grew as well as their topA+ parents. It is known, however, that DNA topoisomerase I bearing the mutations L5F C662H or G65N W79S had a significant level of residual activity at 42 °C (36Zhu C.X. Qi H.Y. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Wang Y. Lynch A.S. Chen S.J. Wang J.C. J. Biol.

To better define the requirement of DNA topoisomerase I at 42 °C, strain AB1369 and MG1655 derivatives bearing Plac-topA ts (L5F C662H) or Plac-topA ts (G65N W79S) were constructed (see Table II). In these cells, expression of DNA topoisomerase I is strongly dependent on the presence of IPTG, as demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pVS1 recovered from AB1369 bearing Plac-topA ts (L5F C662H) (Fig. 3). At 30 °C, the plasmid became much more negatively supercoiled following the removal of IPTG (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 2). In the presence of IPTG, the patterns at 30 and 42 °C also showed that the plasmid was more negatively supercoiled at the higher temperature, again demonstrating the thermal sensitivity of the mutant topoisomerase (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2 and 4). Plating of the mutant cells showed that even in the absence of IPTG, at 42 °C both of the Plac-topA ts derivatives grew as well as their topA+ parents, which strengthens the notion that DNA topoisomerase I is dispensable for cell growth. Cold Sensitivity of E. coli topA Mutants Lacking DNA Topoisomerase I—At 30 °C and in the absence of IPTG, the two Plac-topA ts derivatives of either strain AB1369 or MG1655 grew very poorly relative to their respective topA+ parent; comparable growth of the isogenic topA+ and topA ts strains at this lower temperature was only seen in the presence of IPTG. This strong temperature dependence of the growth of topA-deficient cells was also seen in a derivative of strain MG1655, in which the wild-type topA locus was replaced by Plac-topA(L5F). As noted earlier, DNA topoisomerase I with an L5F mutation is indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme, at least in terms of its enzymatic activity. It was observed that MG1655 Plac-topA(L5F) grew well at either 30 or 42 °C in the presence of IPTG; in the absence of IPTG, however, a precipitous drop in topA (L5F) expression was expected, and the cells were found to grow normally at 42 °C but very poorly at 30 °C. E. coli ΔtopA Cells Are Viable at 42 or 37 °C but Not at 30 °C—In a separate series of experiments, a ΔtopA mutation, in which a large region of the topA coding sequence and the entire promoter of the gene (region indicated by Y in Fig. 1) were absent, was first introduced into strain MG1655 by DNA-mediated gene replacement at 42 °C, a temperature at which cells lacking DNA topoisomerase I are apparently viable, as described above. A transformant bearing this ΔtopA locus, as ascertained by Southern blot hybridization and PCR, was then used as the donor strain in a transduction experiment using phage P1vir. As a control, MG1655 bearing Plac-topA ts (L5F C662H), which has been shown to grow well at 42 °C in the presence or absence of IPTG, was"

Recent studies have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a potent inducer of fibroblast growth acting, at least in part, through an ERK1/2-dependent signaling pathway. However, the contributions of additional signaling pathways to extracellular ATP-mediated cell proliferation have not been defined. By using both pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we found that in addition to ERK1/2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and p70 S6K-dependent signaling pathways are required for ATP-induced proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts. We found that extracellular ATP acting in part through Gi proteins increased PI3K activity in a time-dependent manner and transient phosphorylation of Akt. This PI3K pathway is not involved in ATP-induced activation of ERK1/2, implying activation of independent parallel signaling pathways by ATP. Extracellular ATP induced dramatic increases in mTOR and p70 S6K phosphorylation. This activation of the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K) pathway in response to ATP is because of independent contributions of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, which converge on the level of p70 S6K. ATP-dependent activation of mTOR and p70 S6K also requires additional signaling inputs perhaps from pathways operating through Gα or Gβγ subunits. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ATP-induced adventitial fibroblast proliferation requires activation and interaction of multiple signaling pathways such as PI3K, Akt, mTOR, p70 S6K, and ERK1/2 and provide evidence for purinergic regulation of the protein translational pathways related to cell proliferation.

Release of ATP from vascular wall cells has been demonstrated in response to a number of environmental stimuli including shear stress, stretch, osmotic load, and hypoxia (1Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). This release of ATP is speculated to play an important autocrine/paracrine role in modulating various functions of vascular wall cells, including growth. Specifically, extracellular ATP has been demonstrated to stimulate DNA synthesis in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and adventitial fibroblasts, as well as in glial cells, lymphocytes, and renal mesangial cells (2Erlinge D.

However, whether ATP stimulates PI3K and/or mTOR signaling in vascular fibroblasts and whether these pathways play a role in ATP-induced proliferation are not known. The importance of PI3K, mTOR, and p70 S6K as key regulators of cell growth in some, but not all, cell systems has been established. There is solid evidence that PI3K is involved in the mitogenic response of vascular, airway, and intestinal smooth muscle cells to a variety of growth-promoting agents (8Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L.

Physiol. 1998; 275: H1209-H1215PubMed Google Scholar), in which pharmacologic inhibitors were exclusively utilized, has implicated a role for PI3K activation in ATP-mediated proliferative responses. Furthermore, there is no information on signaling events downstream from PI3K that may be involved in regulating ATP-induced cell growth. Therefore, since G protein-regulated PI3K isoforms are expressed in lung tissue and vascular cells (12Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 15Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell.

Cellular proliferation requires protein translation that involves mTOR and p70 S6K pathways. Several studies have clearly demonstrated the critical importance of mTOR in cell cycle regulation, metabolic responses, transformation, tumor growth and patterning during embryonic development (20Schmelzle T.

The role of mTOR in cell growth is based on findings that the immunosuppressant rapamycin blocks mTOR activity through specific interaction with FK-binding protein (24Sabatini D.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1994; 78: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). mTOR is known to act on downstream targets such as p70 S6K and 4E-BP1 (for review see Ref. 23Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). p70 S6K phosphorylates the 6S ribosomal protein of the 40 S ribosomal subunit and is involved in translational control of the 5′-oligopyrimidine tract mRNAs (23Gingras A.C.

Although the regulation of mTOR and p70 S6K by growth factors operating through receptor tyrosine kinase has been extensively studied, the regulation by G protein-coupled receptor pathways has received relatively little attention. Specific activation of mTOR and/or p70 S6K signaling by extracellular ATP or other purinergic agonists has not been reported to our knowledge. Both PI3K and mTOR belong to the family of phosphatidylinositol kinase-like kinases. These proteins share a common structure of C-terminal lipid kinase domain and, as has been shown in in vitro kinase assays, are sensitive to wortmannin and LY294002 (20Schmelzle T. Hall M.N.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Hence, when these inhibitors are used as a pharmacological tool to define the contribution of the PI3K pathway, they often cannot distinguish the individual contribution of PI3K versus mTOR pathways to cellular responses. It has been demonstrated that PI3K and mTOR may act either via parallel independent pathways or via an interaction between PI3K and mTOR that is mediated by Akt (27Somwar R. Sumitani S. Taha C. Sweeney G. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E618-E625PubMed Google Scholar, 28Belham C.M. Scott P.H. Twomey D.P. Gould G.W. Wadsworth R.M. Plevin R. Cell.

Akt is recognized as a downstream PI3K target, which plays a central role in a number of key biological functions (for review see Ref. 33Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). In addition to its well known role in cell survival and metabolic responses, an important role for Akt in cell cycle regulation has also been reported (34Dugourd C. Gervais M. Corvol P. Monnot C. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Stabile E. Zhou Y.F. Saji M. Castagna M. Shou M. Kinnaird T.D. Baffour R. Ringel M.D. Epstein S.E. Fuchs S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of Akt to cell proliferation, and its role in mediating PI3K-dependent mTOR regulation, has been suggested to be cell type-specific and stimulus-dependent. Its role in ATP-initiated DNA synthesis and mTOR activation is unknown at the present time. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate specifically the contribution of PI3K, mTOR, and p70 S6K pathways on ATP-induced adventitial fibroblast proliferation and to examine a possible role of Akt in mediating cross-talk between PI3K and mTOR pathways. By using pharmacological approaches, in vitro kinase assays, and genetic alterations in Akt expression, we show that ATP-induced adventitial fibroblast proliferation requires PI3K, Akt, ERK1/2, mTOR, and p70 S6K-dependent pathways. Furthermore, we provide evidence that ATP-induced activations of PI3K and ERK1/2 are independent events and that PI3K, Akt, and ERK1/2 play a positive regulatory role in supporting mTOR and p70 S6K activity. To our knowledge, the present findings demonstrate for the first time a role for extracellular ATP on the activation of mTOR, p70 S6K, and S6 ribosomal protein, which are well known to be key regulators of the protein translation pathway. These observations are important for understanding cell growth in the systems where extracellular nucleotide concentrations may be actively regulated by environmental stimuli such as hypoxia. Cell Culture—Pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from tissue explants of 120–180-day gestational bovine fetuses as described previously (3Gerasimovskaya E.V. Ahmad S. White C.W.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 20 mm l-glutamine (Cellgro), nonessential amino acids (1:100, v/v), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). Cell cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and medium was changed every 3 days. For expansion, fibroblasts were cultured to confluence, harvested with trypsin/EDTA solution (0.2–0.5 g/liter), and replaced at 1:4 ratio. All studies were performed on cells between passages 2 and 6. For the assays, the cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/cm2, cultured to 80% of confluence, growth-arrested in DMEM for 96 h, and then subjected to the experimental conditions described below. DNA Synthesis Analysis—DNA synthesis was determined by [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 12 × 103 cells/well in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS. The next day the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in serum-deprived DMEM for 72 h. Cells were preincubated with or without LY294002 (20 μm, 60 min), wortmannin (100 nm, 2 h), rapamycin (5 nm, 60 min), UO126 (10 μm, 60 min) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml, 18–20 h) (List Biological Laboratories, San Jose, CA) and then stimulated with ATP (100 μm) in the presence of 1.0 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 24 h. To stop the incubation, fibroblasts were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS, incubated with 0.5 ml of 0.2 m perchloric acid for 3 min, washed with PBS, and lysed in 0.3 ml of 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaOH. Thereafter the samples were harvested and mixed with liquid scintillation mixture (Ecoscint H, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), and incorporated [methyl-3H]thymidine was counted (cpm/min) in a scintillation β-counter (Beckman LS 6500). Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Adventitial fibroblasts were cultured to near-confluence and serum-starved in DMEM for 96 h. For the experiments with PI3K, mTOR, and Akt inhibitors, cells were preincubated with LY294002, wortmannin, rapamycin (Cell Signaling Technology), SH-5, SH-6 (36Kozikowski A.P. Sun H. Brognard J. Dennis P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1144-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA), or NL-71–101 (37Reuveni H. Livnah N. Geiger T. Klein S. Ohne O. Cohen I. Benhar M. Gellerman G. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10304-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Calbiochem), as described in the figure legends. For the experiments aimed at investigating the involvement of Gi proteins in ATP-mediated responses, cells were treated with pertussis toxin (PTx, 100 ng/ml) for 18–20 h. Cells were stimulated with ATP (100 μm) in serum-free media for variable periods of time. After stimulation, fibroblasts were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with Tris-HCl buffer (40 mm, pH 7.5, 4 °C), containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25 m sucrose, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 7500 × g for 10 min at +4 °C, and supernatant fractions were collected and stored at –80 °C. Equivalent amounts of total cell protein (10–25 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 (Tyr-202/Thr-204), phospho-p70 S6K (Thr-421/Ser-424 and Thr-389), phospho-Akt (Thr-308 and Ser-473), phospho-mTOR (Ser-2448 and Ser-2481), and phospho-S6 (Ser-235/236) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). After washing with TBS-Tween buffer, membranes were incubated with mouse anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG, 1:10,000 dilution (Amersham Biosciences), for 1 h at room temperature. For detection of the nonphosphorylated form of these proteins, membranes were stripped with buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween, and reprobed with antibodies against total Akt, p70 S6K, ERK1/2, mTOR, and S6 proteins (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL kit (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by exposure to Hyperfilm and then quantitatively analyzed with a densitometry system. Assay of in Vitro PI3K Activity—Adventitial fibroblasts were grown to 80% confluency in 100-mm2 dishes, growth-arrested in DMEM without serum for 4 days, and then stimulated with ATP (100 μm). After stimulation, cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mm activated orthovanadate and incubated in 750 μl of lysis buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and incubated for 20 min at +4 °C. Cell lysates were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to sediment insoluble material. Supernatants were normalized for protein content (Bio-Rad assay kit) and incubated with anti-p85 antibody linked to protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). One microgram of antibody was used per 0.5 mg of total cell protein. After rocking at +4 °C for 1–2 h, agarose beads containing antibody-enzyme complexes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 s and washed three times with buffer A (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate), three times with buffer B (0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm LiCl, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate), and three times with buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer C and combined with 10 μl (20 μg) of sonicated phosphatidylinositol and 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2. The phosphorylation reaction (final volume 80 μl) was started by addition of 10 μl of mixture, containing 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mm, 3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.88 mm ATP. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 6 n HCl. Radiolabeled lipids were extracted with 160 μl of chloroform/methanol mixture (1:1, v/v). Organic phase was separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, and lipids were separated on oxalate-coated silicon TLC plates (Silica Gel 60, Sigma) by chromatography in CH3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH (60:40:11.3:2 by volume) solvent system in parallel with nonradioactive standard. Radioactive spots were revealed by autoradiography and quantitatively analyzed with a densitometry system. Assay of in Vitro p70 S6K Activity—The p70 S6K immunocomplex kinase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with small modifications (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Charlottesville, VA). Quiescent fibroblasts in 100-mm dishes were stimulated with ATP (100 μm) for the indicated times, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and solubilized in 700 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm PMSF, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)). Lysates were incubated for 20 min on ice, centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to sediment insoluble material, and precleaned with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose Plus suspension (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Equivalent amounts (350 μg) of total cell protein were incubated with 2.5 μg of sheep polyclonal anti-p70 S6K antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) while rocking at +4 °C for 2 h and then with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads at +4°C for 1–2 h. Beads containing antibody-enzyme complexes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 s and washed twice with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, twice with lysis buffer alone, and twice with Assay Dilution Buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase reaction was carried out for 15 min at 37 °C with S6 ribosomal protein peptide (AKRRRLSSLRA) as a substrate. S6 kinase activity was determined as picomoles of phosphate incorporated into substrate per min. Adenovirus Production and Cell Infection—Replication-defective adenovirus vectors expressing dominant-negative and constitutively active forms of murine Akt tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope were the kind gifts of Dr. K. Walsh (Tufts University School of Medicine). The dominant-negative Akt mutant (Ad-dnAkt) has alanine residues substituted for Thr-308 and Ser-473. The constitutively active Akt (Ad-MyrAkt) has the c-Src myristoylation sequence fused in-frame to the N terminus of wild-type Akt, thus targeting the fusion protein to the membrane. Control cultures were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing only the GFP transgene (Ad-GFP). All viruses were purified by CsCl ultracentrifugation. Adventitial fibroblasts were grown to 60–70% confluence, growth-arrested in serum-free DMEM for 72 h, and then infected overnight at a 125 multiplicity of infection/cell. Expression of hemagglutinin-tagged Akt was determined in total cell lysates by Western blot analysis with rat anti-hemagglutinin peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Roche Applied Science). Data Analysis—Density of bands of Western blots film images was determined using NIH ImageJ program. Data are expressed as average means ± S.E.; n equals the number of replicates in one experiment or the number of observations in independent experiments. To evaluate significance of the data, a Student-Newman-Keuls test followed by one-way analysis of variance was performed. Extracellular ATP-induced Proliferative Responses in Adventitial Fibroblasts Involve PI3K and mTOR—Although ATP has been demonstrated to activate PI3K signaling in renal mesangial cells, this pathway is not thought to be directly involved in ATP-induced proliferation in these cells (38Huwiler A. Rolz W. Dorsch S. Ren S. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 520-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, PI3K signaling is thought to be important in cell proliferation (10Goncharova E.A. Ammit A.J. Irani C. Carroll R.G. Eszterhas A.J.

Therefore, we initiated our studies using pharmacological inhibitors to determine whether PI3K and/or mTOR are critical signaling components in ATP-induced proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts. DNA synthesis in response to extracellular ATP was measured in the absence or presence of the indicated compounds. In agreement with our previ"
https://openalex.org/W2040226714,"The number of autosomal mammalian genes subject to random monoallelic expression has been limited to genes highly specific to the function of chemosensory neurons or lymphocytes, making this phenomenon difficult to address systematically. Here we demonstrate that asynchronous DNA replication can be used as a marker for the identification of novel genes with monoallelic expression and identify p120 catenin, a gene involved in cell adhesion, as belonging to this class. p120 is widely expressed; its presence in available cell lines allowed us to address quantitative aspects of monoallelic expression. We show that the epigenetic choice of active allele is clonally stable and that biallelic clones express p120 at twice the level of monoallelic clones. Unlike previous reports about genes of this type, we found that expression of p120 can be monoallelic in one cell type and strictly biallelic in another. We show that in human lymphoblasts, the silencing of one allele is incomplete. These unexpected properties are likely to be wide-spread, as we show that the Tlr4 gene shares them. Identification of monoallelic expression of a nearly ubiquitous gene indicates that this type of gene regulation is more common than previously thought. This has important implications for carcinogenesis and definition of cell identity.

Identification of monoallelic expression of a nearly ubiquitous gene indicates that this type of gene regulation is more common than previously thought. This has important implications for carcinogenesis and definition of cell identity. Although the majority of mammalian genes are expressed from both parental alleles, there are some notable exceptions. In genomic imprinting, one allele is transcriptionally silenced, dependent on its parental origin (1Reik W. Walter J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). By contrast, X inactivation in females is a random process that leads to the silencing of most of the genes along one of the two copies of the X chromosome (2Lyon M.F. Nature. 1986; 320: 313Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This random choice is made independently by multiple cells around the time of implantation, and descendant cells maintain the choice, leading to mosaicism. In the last decade, a class of genes has emerged with properties similar to the genes subject to random X inactivation. Initially, the only known randomly monoallelically expressed genes on autosomes were the antigen receptors on lymphocytes (3Pernis B. Chiappino G. Kelus A.S. Gell P.G. J. Exp. Med. 1965; 122: 853-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), which were considered a special case because they undergo DNA rearrangement. Interest in this type of regulation was stimulated by the discovery that the members of a 1,000-gene family of olfactory receptor genes are also expressed in a random monoallelic fashion (4Chess A. Simon I. Cedar H. Axel R. Cell. 1994; 78: 823-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Pheromone receptors and a number of immune system molecules, including natural killer cell receptors and interleukins, have now been shown to be monoallelically expressed (5Bix M. Locksley R.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 6Hollander G.A. Zuklys S. Morel C. Mizoguchi E. Mobisson K. Simpson S. Terhorst C. Wishart W. Golan D.E. Bhan A.K.

Interleukins differ from other genes in this class in that their transcription can be monoallelic in some cells and biallelic in other cells (5Bix M. Locksley R.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 7Rhoades K.L. Singh N. Simon I. Glidden B. Cedar H. Chess A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 789-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). How can novel genes that are subject to random monoallelic expression be identified? Technical challenges of single-cell analysis of allelic choice in a mosaic tissue make identification of more genes with this type of regulation difficult. However, all classes of monoallelically expressed genes share the property of asynchronous DNA replication: during S-phase, one allele is replicated before the other. This DNA replication asynchrony has been assayed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 1The abbreviations used are: FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism; RT, reverse transcription; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; SD, single dot-double dot; Abl-MLV, Abelson murine leukemia virus; Cs, castaneus; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; DAPI, 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; ES, embryonic stem. and S-phase fractionation methods (9Taylor J.H.

Genet. 2003; 33: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For genes subject to random monoallelic expression, asynchronous DNA replication is coordinated in a chromosome-wide fashion (13Singh N. Ebrahimi F.A. Gimelbrant A.A. Ensminger A.W. Tackett M.R. Qi P. Gribnau J. Chess A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Ensminger A.W. Chess A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Importantly, the asynchrony is independent of expression of the gene in the assayed tissue (e.g. olfactory receptor gene replication is asynchronous in fibroblasts or ES cells, where these genes are not expressed). Thus, an attractive approach to identifying of novel loci is to detect asynchronous replication in a clonal cell line and then characterize expression of the candidate genes in the appropriate cell types. Using this strategy, we found that the p120 catenin gene, 2The symbols for the gene are catns in mouse and ctnnd1 in human; for uniformity, we refer to both as p120 in this paper. which encodes a component of the cell adhesion machinery, is an asynchronously replicated gene. We show that it is monoallelically expressed in a subset of mouse and human clonal cell lines in a manner similar to interleukins. The p120 catenin gene is widely expressed (15Montonen O. Aho M. Uitto J. Aho S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in contrast to the previously characterized monoallelically expressed genes. Expression of this gene in cell types that are easy to isolate and subclone allows for characterization of its transcriptional regulation. Animals and Cells—To obtain 129xCsF1 animals, 129/SvJ females were crossed with CAST/Ei males (Jackson Laboratory). Abelson cells were prepared from bone marrow of 6-week-old F1 animals or from embryonic day 14 liver by infecting primary culture with Abelson virus (16Rosenberg N. Baltimore D. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1932-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Primary fibroblasts were generated simultaneously from ears of the same adult animals or from the embryonic tissue of the same embryos, respectively; after primary culture establishment, they were transformed with SV40. Cells were further cloned by limiting dilution (to the average of 0.3 cells/well) or by FACS. Normal human lymphoblastoid lines were obtained from Coriell cell repository, grown according to instructions, and cloned by FACS. Clonal ES cell lines used for primer extension replication timing analysis were provided by Dr. A. Wutz. E1A-transformed fibroblasts were provided by Dr. Elsa Flores. Replicaton Timing—FISH was performed essentially as described (10Selig S. Okumura K. Ward D.C. Cedar H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were given a 45-min pulse of BrdUrd before fixation. The DNA probe (BAC, cosmid, or PCR product as noted) was nick-translated (Amersham Biosciences kit) with Cy3-dCTP (Molecular Probes) or FluorX-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). After overnight hybridization and stringent washes, the nuclei were stained with anti-BrdUrd antibodies, stained with secondary antibody (Covance or Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) coupled to fluorophore complementary to that of the probe, and counterstained with DAPI. For replication timing analysis, only BrdUrd-positive cells were counted. The complete list of probes is available in the supplemental material to this article. Primer extension was performed as described previously (17Xiong Z. Tsark W. Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. Unsynchronized clonal populations of ES cells from 129xCsF1 mouse were grown in the presence of LIF. 108 cells were fixed in 75% EtOH in a standard procedure for cell cycle analysis (18Latt S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3395-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), stained with DAPI in the presence of RNase A, and FACS-sorted into eight fractions: G0/G1, six equally wide S-phase fractions, and G2. Each sorted fraction contained at least 5 × 105 cells. Genomic DNA was prepared from these fractions in a standard procedure (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The informative single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in mouse was CTTGACCTGGC(T/C)GTTTTGCAAG (20Lindblad-Toh K. Winchester E. Daly M.J. Wang D.G. Hirschhorn J.N. Laviolette J.P. Ardlie K. Reich D.E.

The list of all used polymorphisms and primers (for PCR and primer extension) is in the supplemental material. To distinguish the parental alleles, SNP was used in a genotyping procedure recommended by the manufacturer. In the DNA prepared from each cell cycle fraction, regions containing the SNP were PCR-amplified. The relative amount of the two parental alleles was determined by primer extension of PCR products. Detection was by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on Sequenom (San Diego, CA) MassArray platform (21Cowles C. Hirschhorn J.N. Altshuler D. Lander E.S. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 22Tang K. Fu D.J. Julien D. Braun A. Cantor C.R. Koster H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10016-10020Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In each reaction, the ratio of peak heights corresponding to the two alleles was calibrated to a series of mixes with a known composition of purified genomic DNA from parental strains (Jackson Laboratory). These ratios were 60:40, 50:50, and 40:60 mix. DNA from each point in the cell cycle was amplified and measured in quadruplicate. RT-PCR and RFLP Analysis—Total RNA from 2-5 million cells was prepared with standard TRIzol (Invitrogen) protocol with additional genomic DNA digestion (DNAfree kit, Ambion). 0.5-1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus polymerase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers (Ambion). 0.5-1 μl of RT reaction was used as PCR template with 5-10 μl added directly into endonuclease digestion reaction, the results of which were resolved on 2% agarose gel and stained with EtBr. The complete list of all polymorphisms and primers is in the supplemental material. Gel quantitation was performed using the NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available online at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image) with the included set of gel analysis macros. Mass spectrometric quantitation of RT-PCR products was performed as described for genomic DNA except that 0.1 μl of RT reaction was used as template for PCR and mixes of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 of paternal: maternal genomic DNA were used for calibration. Asynchronous Replication of p120 Catenin—We identified the p120 catenin gene as an asynchronously replicating gene (Fig. 1, A and B). The first approach involved S-phase fractionation, PCR, and primer extension to analyze allele-specific DNA replication in cells derived from an F1 mouse as described previously (13Singh N. Ebrahimi F.A. Gimelbrant A.A. Ensminger A.W. Tackett M.R. Qi P. Gribnau J. Chess A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Xiong Z. Tsark W. Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We confirmed the asynchronous replication of p120 catenin using a standard FISH assay (4Chess A. Simon I. Cedar H. Axel R. Cell. 1994; 78: 823-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 10Selig S. Okumura K. Ward D.C. Cedar H.

Genet. 2003; 33: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in primary mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 1, C and D) as well as SV40 and E1A-transformed fibroblasts, ES cells, and Abelson cells (not shown). In this FISH analysis, replicated loci are visualized as a double dot hybridization signal, whereas unreplicated loci reveal a single dot. Asynchronously replicating genes reveal a single dot-double dot (SD) pattern in 30-40% of S-phase cells as opposed to around 10-20% SD for synchronously replicating genes. Monoallelic Expression of Mouse p120 Catenin—We analyzed p120 catenin expression in Abelson murine leukemia virus (Abl-MLV)-transformed pre-B cell clonal cell lines derived from an F1 cross between a female 129 mouse and a male Mus musculus castaneus (Cs) mouse. Clonal cell lines were made by using a FACS to place a single-cell well or by limiting dilution. Both approaches gave similar results. After determining that these cell lines express all four of the splice variants described previously, we proceeded to assess the relative mRNA levels of the two alleles of the p120 gene. We took advantage of an SNP present in the 3′-untranslated region of the message that can be distinguished using either primer extension or a polymorphic HaeIII restriction endonuclease site (RFLP analysis). Examples of restriction endonuclease analyses revealing monoallelic and biallelic cell lines are shown in Fig. 2A. In total, we analyzed 78 clonal Abl-MLV-transformed pre-B cell lines (derived from eight mice) for p120 expression using RFLP. Analyses of allele-specific expression were also performed using Sequenom mass spectrometric primer extension genotyping of RT-PCR products (Fig. 2D). Although this genotyping platform is normally used to call heterozygotes and homozygotes, it has been demonstrated to detect the presence of a rare allele at 2% in a complex mixture (23Ross P. Hall L. Haff L.A. BioTechniques. 2000; 29 (628-629): 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Buetow K.H. Edmonson M. MacDonald R. Clifford R. Yip P. Kelley J. Little D.P. Strausberg R. Koester H. Cantor C.R. Braun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Therefore, for the Abl-MLV-transformed lines with only one allele detected, there is at least 50-fold skewing. Sixty percent of the lines monoallelically express the p120 catenin gene (32% 129 and 28% Cs), with the remaining 40% of the lines showing biallelic expression. This distribution of monoallelic versus biallelic expression is similar to what has been observed for the interleukin-2 and -4 genes (5Bix M. Locksley R.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 7Rhoades K.L. Singh N. Simon I. Glidden B. Cedar H. Chess A. Curr.

Monoallelic lines were stable for up to 50 weeks maintained in continuous culture (Fig. 2B). Biallelic clonal cell lines were also stable, and in one case, we performed subcloning of a biallelic line and analyzed 15 subclones, all of which maintained biallelic expression qualitatively similar to the parental clonal cell line. Abl-MLV-transformed cell lines express all four reported splice variants of p120 catenin (15Montonen O. Aho M. Uitto J. Aho S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) regardless of whether the paternal allele, maternal allele, or both alleles are expressed (Fig. 2C). To assess the relative levels of transcription in monoallelic versus biallelic lines, we employed real-time quantitative PCR analysis of RT products, in each case normalizing the p120 level to the measured level of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript. On average, the biallelic clones express p120 catenin at twice the level of monoallelic clones (Fig. 2E). Although there is a relatively high variation in the level of expression among both monoallelic and biallelic cell lines, a Student's t test analysis (two-tailed with unequal variance) indicates that the difference between the two distributions is significant at the p < 0.05 level. The distributions are consistent with a 2-fold difference in expression between monoallelic and biallelic expression, suggesting that if a given allele is transcribed, its level of expression is independent of whether or not the other allele is active. Asynchronous Replication and Monoallelic Expression of the Human p120 Catenin Gene—Replication timing of the human p120 catenin gene was examined using the FISH-based replication timing assay on primary human fibroblasts. The human p120 gene reveals 41% of S-phase cells with an SD pattern, which is consistent with other asynchronously replicating genes (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, as was observed for the mouse gene, the human p120 catenin gene is asynchronously replicating. The relative expression levels of the two alleles of the human p120 gene were determined by analyzing clonal Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines derived from an individual heterozygous for a BstNI RFLP in the p120 catenin cDNA. Subclones were generated using single-cell FACS sorting and subjected to RT-PCR after sufficient cell expansion. Digestion of the RT-PCR product with the BstNI endonuclease reveals that one allele is digested and the other allele is not digested. Analyses of 23 single cell-derived subclones show a variety of patterns (Fig. 3C) with some cell lines preferentially expressing one allele and others preferentially expressing the other allele. Other cell lines express roughly equal levels of both alleles. A control analysis of genomic DNA derived from the parental cell line indicates that the primers amplify both alleles with a slight bias toward the undigested allele. The extent of allele-specific bias of the expression of the human p120 gene is not as great as the extent of skewing observed in the mouse. We estimate the extent of the human gene bias to be 10-20-fold in some lines (Fig. 3C). By contrast, in the murine Abl-MLV-transformed clones monoallelically expressing p120, the skewing was at least 50-fold if not absolute (Fig. 2D). Monoallelic Expression of the Mouse Tlr4 Gene—To examine a second monoallelically expressed gene in the same murine Abl-MLV-transformed clones analyzed above, we examined the Tlr4 receptor gene, which is monoallelically expressed in B cells (25Pereira J.P. Girard R. Chaby R. Cumano A. Vieira P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Tlr4 receptor is involved in innate immunity. We demonstrated that Tlr4 is asynchronously replicating in mouse cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Analyses of clonal cell lines indicated that one-fourth have monoallelic expression for either the maternal or paternal allele (Fig. 4C). However, these cell lines with monoallelic expression are not absolute in their monoallelic expression. Rather, we observe skewing of expression reminiscent of the skewing observed in analysis of the human p120 catenin gene. Based on control PCR experiments with known mixes of the two alleles as input, we estimate that the skewing observed in some Abl-MLV-transformed B cell lines is ∼20-fold (data not shown). Recall that the skewing observed for the human p120 catenin gene is ∼10-fold. The mouse Tlr4 is therefore a second example of an autosomal randomly monoallelically expressed gene that is not absolute in its allele-specific transcription patterns. We also examined clonal fibroblast cell lines for allele-specific transcription of Tlr4 and found only biallelic lines (12 lines). Note that similar analyses of 14 clonal fibroblast lines revealed only lines biallelic for expression of the p120 catenin gene. Tlr4 and p120 catenin are on different chromosomes; therefore, based on our prior observation that asynchronous replication is independently regulated for different chromosomes, we asked whether the allele specificity of monoallelic transcription of Tlr4 and p120 catenin are also independently regulated. We addressed this question by analyzing clonal Abl-MLV-transformed B cell lines for allele-specific expression of both p120 catenin and Tlr4. In total, 43 lines were examined both for the Tlr4 and p120 catenin genes. Six of the lines were monoallelic for both genes, nine were biallelic for both genes, and 28 were monoallelic for one gene and biallelic for the other. These analyses reveal that the two genes are independent in their monoallelic expression (Fig. 4C). In the four examples shown, clonal Abl-MLV-transformed lines express p120 catenin from the maternal allele. The maternal and paternal alleles of p120 can be distinguished using an RFLP; the maternal (129 allele) is digested by the AflIII restriction endonuclease. One of these lines predominantly expresses the paternal Tlr4 allele, one line predominantly expresses the maternal allele, and two lines express equal amounts of the two alleles. We also analyzed clonal cell lines prepared by limiting dilution, which also reveal monoallelic expression for both genes (Fig. 4C). Thus, in terms of both whether there is monoallelic expression and which parental allele is monoallelically transcribed, these two genes are independently regulated. We have demonstrated a new strategy for identifying a novel gene with random monoallelic expression. We detected asynchronous replication of p120 catenin, confirmed it by an independent method, and then characterized the allele-specific expression of the gene in fibroblasts and cells of the B cell lineage. The advantage of this approach is that it does not depend on whether the candidate gene is expressed in the cells used for initial analysis. This should allow for the scaling up of this approach to identify candidate genes in a systematic fashion, including genes expressed in an extremely restricted manner. Our observation of allele-specific transcription of the p120 catenin gene has added several unexpected facets to our understanding of the epigenetic phenomenon of random monoallelic expression. Unlike the other genes in this class, such as olfactory receptors and T and B cell receptors, p120 is very widely expressed in human and mouse tissues. This expands the class of such genes in a crucial way, suggesting that other widely expressed genes may share this mode of transcriptional regulation. p120 catenin is similar to interleukins in that although a majority of Abelson cells express it from a single allele, a significant fraction of cells is expressing both alleles equally. We found that p120 catenin is asynchronously replicated and monoallelically expressed in both mouse and human cell lines. This suggests that natural selection favored the features responsible for this unusual type of gene regulation over the ∼60 million years separating primates and rodents from their last common ancestor. Monoallelic expression of p120 may be directly advantageous for mammals. It is also possible that it is a consequence of the genome architecture in this region, because in both mouse and human genome, p120 is less than 1 megabase away from clusters of olfactory receptors. We observed, for the first time, that a gene can be randomly monoallelically expressed in one cell type (p120 in Abelson cells) and completely biallelically expressed in another (fibroblasts, Fig. 2). In practical terms, this shows that observing biallelic or monoallelic expression of a given gene in one cell type is not necessarily predictive for other cell types. More generally, this observation raises an important mechanistic question: what is the difference between the cells that are monoallelic or biallelic with respect to a given gene? Either their DNA carries different epigenetic modifications or the modifications are identical, but cells of one type are competent for transcriptional readout of such modifications and cells of another type are not. Note that some epigenetic mark is always present, as asynchronous DNA replication of p120 is ubiquitous. Further study of p120 and similar genes will help to distinguish these possibilities. The question of causal relationship between asynchronous DNA replication and random monoallelic expression is very intriguing. To our knowledge, all known genes subject to random monoallelic expression are replicated asynchronously, an observation further confirmed by asynchronous replication of Tlr4 locus (Fig. 4). Asynchronous replication thus appears to be a necessary condition of random monoallelic expression. It is, however, not a sufficient condition. For example, transcription of p120 is completely biallelic in fibroblasts, even as its replication is asynchronous in these cells. Moreover, further analysis should determine whether early or late replication status of a p120 allele determines the activity of the allele. We have shown previously that for Ig-κ, rearrangement occurs on the early replicating allele, rendering it active (12Mostoslavsky R. Singh N. Tenzen T. Goldmit M. Gabay C. Elizur S. Qi P. Reubinoff B.E. Chess A. Cedar H. Bergman Y. Nature. 2001; 414: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar); this may also hold true for non-rearranged loci. Determining the relative allele activity is an inherent challenge in the analysis of random monoallelic expression. Expression in tissues is mosaic, and single-cell approaches provide limited ability for quantitative study. The fact that p120 is transcribed from either paternal or maternal allele in stable clonal cell lines allowed us to analyze its expression in more detail. The quantitative analysis of p120 expression in human lymphoblastoid lines revealed the unexpected feature of incomplete silencing, where in some cell lines, one allele is about 10-fold less active then the other (Fig. 3). This resembles the incomplete and variegated silencing of X-linked gene Rep1 in female cells (26Carrel L. Willard H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7364-7369Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Another intriguing observation is that cell lines expressing p120 from both alleles have a level of p120 transcript about 2-fold higher than in the lines expressing p120 from a single allele (Fig. 2E). Thus, similar to X inactivation, it appears that the transcriptional regulation is centered not on the total level of transcript in the cell but on each given promoter. When the second allele is “on,” both alleles are equally active, resulting in a double dose of the transcript. Therefore, monoallelic expression in a fraction of cells of a given type creates variability in the dose of expression of the affected gene. It is especially noteworthy that even with two absolutely identical alleles, the difference in the transcript level of the affected gene between cells expressing the gene from one allele and cells expressing it from both alleles can cause these cells to be functionally different. This is potentially relevant to tumorigenesis, as discussed below. Both incomplete silencing and cell type dependence of monoallelic expression are not unique features of p120, as we show that Tlr4 shares these properties in mouse cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that these properties may be relatively wide-spread. Another point arising from our analysis of monoallelic expression of Tlr4 and p120 in the same cells is that these genes are independently regulated. We have shown previously that the epigenetic mark responsible for asynchronous replication is independent for different autosomes, even as it is coordinated on a given autosomal pair (13Singh N. Ebrahimi F.A. Gimelbrant A.A. Ensminger A.W. Tackett M.R. Qi P. Gribnau J. Chess A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Considering that p120 and Tlr4 are on different chromosomes, it is thus not surprising that their transcriptional choices are independent of one another. However, an important point arises with monoallelic genes that could be coexpressed in the same cell (similar to p120 and Tlr4). Even the cells with exactly the same expression profile would differ in their complement of alleles expressed from multiple genes of this type. The combinatorial possibilities are large and add an extra dimension to the definition of cell identity. An especially intriguing hypothesis concerns variability in allele-specific expression in genes involved in carcinogenesis. Increased epigenetic heterogeneity has been suggested as a contributing factor in metastatic potential of tumor cells (27Ohlsson R. Kanduri C. Whitehead J. Pfeifer S. Lobanenkov V. Feinberg A.P. Adv. Cancer Res. 2003; 88: 145-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The exclusive expression of a defective allele of a tumor suppressor gene would increase chances of malignant transformation in this cell (28Ohlsson R. Tycko B. Sapienza C. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 435-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A more subtle possibility is presented by p120 catenin. As part of the E-cadherin complex (29Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), p120 catenin interacts with tyrosine kinases (30Piedra J. Miravet S. Castano J. Palmer H.G. Garcia de Heisterkamp N. Herreros A. Dunach M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2287-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 31Cozzolino M. Stagni V. Spinardi L. Campioni N. Fiorentini C. Salvati E. Alema S. Salvatore A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1964-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and their activity impacts the strength of cell-cell adhesion. Overrepresentation of individual splice variants of human p120 catenin has been shown to dramatically affect cell shape (32Aho S. Levansuo L. Montonen O. Kari C. Rodeck U. Uitto J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the observation of changes in expression of p120 in tumors has led to the suggestion of a role for p120 in tumorigenesis and/or metastasis (29Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 33Mo Y.Y. Reynolds A.B.

Monoallelic expression could cause even a subtle mutation (e.g. a mutation affecting preferential outcomes of alternative splicing) to change the function of the cell expressing only the mutated allele. Moreover, as noted above, even with two identical alleles, random monoallelic expression can cause variation in levels of expression, including that of p120. These ideas raise an interesting possible connection between monoallelic expression that is present in normal cells and early events in tumorigenesis. We thank S. Gabriel, M. Defelice, and B.

Many cellular functions are regulated by multiprotein complexes. Mass spectrometry-based methods have allowed significant advances in the discovery and identification of the interacting proteins. Furthermore, this technique has also been used to study the (relative) dynamics of protein complexes in different states by the incorporation of stable isotopes (1Ranish J.A. Yi E.C. Leslie D.M.

Labeling with stable isotopes can be achieved either by chemical modification of side-chain amino groups with a reagent containing heavier isotopes (2H, 13C, 15N) (3Oda Y. Huang K. Cross F.R.

Proteomics. 2002; 74: 5774-5782Google Scholar). To understand the function of individual proteins in a complex, it is necessary to analyze the interacting proteins in a quantitative way, which reveals whether a certain protein is present in defined stoichiometric amounts or forms only a weak substoichiometric interaction. To gain a knowledge of the stoichiometry of a protein complex, however, determination of the absolute amounts (7Barnidge D.R. Dratz E.A. Martin T. Bonilla L.E. Moran L.B. Lindall A. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 8Gerber S.A. Rush J. Stemman O. Kirschner M.W. Gygi S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003; 100: 6940-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar) of the complex constituents is required. We recently described a method for the determination of the stoichiometry of protein complexes, which is based on proteolytic digestion of the complex, labeling with a fluorescent reagent specific for amino or sulfhydryl groups, and separation by liquid chromatography with fluorescence and mass-spectrometric detection. The strength of the fluorescence signal of the labeled peptides from different proteins is directly proportional to the stoichiometry of these proteins in the complex (9Hochleitner E.O. Sondermann P. Lottspeich F. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For large multiprotein complexes, this method may be limited because of the difficulty involved in the separation of very complex peptide mixtures; poor resolution of these may lead to an overlap of the peptide peaks in the fluorescence chromatogram, preventing correct quantification. Here we describe the application of a similar approach that overcomes this limitation. We applied the new method to the determination of the protein stoichiometry of the spliceosomal multiprotein complex U1 snRNP. The spliceosome is formed by four small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; TFA, trifluoroacetic acid; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; NMM, N-methylmorpholine; Trt, trityl; tBu, tert-butyl alcohol; Pbf, 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-S-sulfonyl; Boc, tert-butoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; ByBOP, benzotriazolyloxy-tris-(pyrrolidino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate. U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6 (named after their uridine-rich snRNAs) and numerous additional proteins (10Krämer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The snRNPs can be divided into two groups: the U-snRNP-specific proteins and the Sm proteins (11Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The Sm proteins, named SmB, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, SmE, SmF, and SmG, are associated with the Sm binding site of the snRNAs, except for U6, which contains homologous “Sm-like” proteins. Some arginine residues of SmB and SmD3 have symmetrical dimethyl modifications (12Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Lührmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In humans, some tissues, as well as HeLa cells, contain a second SmB protein called SmB′, which is a splicing variant in which the last two amino acid residues are replaced by a new sequence of eleven residues (13van Dam A. Winkel I. Zijlstra-Baalbergen J. Smeenk R. Cuypers H.T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3853-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When bound to the snRNA, the Sm proteins form a very stable core RNP structure. In vitro, Sm proteins form specific protein complexes, and crystal structures have been obtained from the two dimeric SmD1/D2 and SmD3/B complexes. These results prompted the proposal of a heptameric circular model for the Sm core RNP (14Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Furthermore, co-precipitation experiments with genetically labeled yeast Sm proteins have suggested that one copy of each Sm protein is present in the core RNP (15Walke S. Bragado-Nilsson E. Seraphin B. Nagai K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). U1 snRNP, purified from HeLa cells, is the smallest and best characterized human spliceosomal RNP subunit. Besides the Sm proteins, it contains only three specific proteins: U1–70 K, U1-A, and U1-C. Electron cryomicroscopy of U1 snRNP revealed a three-dimensional structure consisting of a circular core domain quite similar to the proposed heptameric Sm ring structure and individual additional domains for U1–70 K and U1-A proteins with sizes compatible with one copy of each of these proteins (16Stark H. Dube P. Lührmann R. Kastner B. Nature. 2001; 409: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The U1-C protein could not be recognized as an individual domain. Although these results suggested the presence of one copy of U1-C, other biochemical experiments suggested that U1-C in the U1 snRNP could be present as a dimer (17Gunnewiek J.M. van Aarssen Y. Wassenaar R. Legrain P. van Venrooij W.J. Nelissen R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4864-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For protein stoichiometry determination, up to three reference peptides were synthesized for each U1 snRNP protein and were quantified and labeled with a [13C]-coded tag, whereas the peptides derived from U1 snRNP proteolysis were labeled with a [12C]-coded tag. Mass spectrometric analysis of mixtures of both kinds of labeled peptides provided information about the absolute quantities of the constituents of the U1 spliceosomal snRNP. Materials—Acetonitrile (gradient grade), urea (analytical grade), dithiothreitol, ammonium chloride, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, analytical grade), and guanidinium hydrochloride (analytical grade) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). HEPES was obtained from Sigma. Water from an ultrapure water system (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was used for preparation of all aqueous solutions. Trypsin and endoproteinases Lys-C, Glu-C, and Asp-N were from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). Tri-isopropylsilane and Me2SO were obtained from Fluka Sigma-Aldrich GmbH (Seelze, Germany), Fmoc amino acids from MultiSynTech GmbH (Witten, Germany), and NMM from Biosolve BV (Valkenswaard, Netherlands). Synthesis of Reference Peptides—Peptide synthesis was performed using Fmoc chemistry (ByBop/NMM activation, Trt/tBu/Pbf/Boc side-chain protection), preloaded Wang Resins (200–400 mesh) on a multiple peptide synthesizer (AMS 422; Abimed GmbH) on a 20-μmol scale. The peptides were cleaved (92.5% TFA, 2.5% water, 5% tri-isopropylsilane) for 1.5 h, precipitated, and washed three times with cold methyl t-butyl ether. Air-dried crude peptides were purified using reversed-phase HPLC (solvents, water-acetonitrile gradients, 0.1% TFA) (HPLC system, Sycam GmbH), a GROM Sil ODS 2 column (25 cm length × 2 cm diameter), and 5-μm C18 silica beads. The purity of the peptide fractions was assessed by analytical reversed-phase HPLC (solvents, water-acetonitrile gradient) (HPLC system, Beckman System Gold), a GE Healthcare SOURCE 5 RPC ST 4.6/150 column (15 cm length × 4.6 mm diameter), and 5-μm C18 polystyrene/divinylbenzene beads. The sequence identity of the peptides was verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Absolute quantification of the reference peptide amounts was performed gravimetrically (accuracy >0.05 mg), carefully minimizing errors caused by peptide hygroscopy or electrostatic effects of the sample cup. Labeling of the Peptides with [13C]Propionyl-N-oxysuccinimide or [13C]Nicotinoyl-N-oxysuccinimide—0.8–6 mg of the reference peptides were dissolved in 1 ml of 10% acetonitrile or 10% acetonitrile and 10% formic acid in water. The sequences of the synthetic peptides matched those of the peptides expected to be created by endoproteinase cleavage of the U1 snRNP. All peptides that corresponded to cleavage products of a distinct proteinase (endoproteinase Lys-C, Asp-N, Glu-C, or trypsin) were combined; this resulted in four peptide mixtures. These solutions were then diluted with water to a volume of 250 μl, resulting in concentrations between 0.03–0.13 μg/μl each peptide. 5 μl of each of these solutions was combined with 45 μl of HEPES buffer (50 mm, pH 8.5). Thereafter, 4 μl of propionyl-N-oxysuccinimide (0.15 m in Me2SO) or nicotinoyl-N-oxysuccinimide (0.15 m in Me2SO) was added. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. To stop the reaction, 4 μl of ammonium chloride (1 m) was added, and the solution was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. To hydrolyze reaction side products with hydroxyl groups (18Wang S. Regnier F.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2001; 924: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Chakroborty A. Regnier F.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2002; 949: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the pH was raised to 12 with NaOH (1 m) for 10 min. The solution was then neutralized by the addition of the same amount of HCl (1 m). 0.5–2 μl of this solution was added to the digest of the human U1 snRNP. Denaturation and Digestion of the Human U1 snRNP—2.5–4 μl of the U1 snRNP (0.5 mg/ml (20Bearden Jr., J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 533: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), purified essentially according to the methods of Bach et al. (21Bach M. Bringmann P. Lührmann R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 232-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and containing its complete set of proteins (see Fig. 1 for a Coomassie-stained electrophoresis gel), were mixed with 20 μl of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride. 1 μl of dithiothreitol (1 mg/ml) was added, and the solution was incubated at 60 °C for 45 min. The solution was then diluted with 180 μl of 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.5), after which 40 μl of endoproteinase Lys-C (0.05 μg/ml), trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, or endoproteinase Asp-N were added, and the digests were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Labeling of the Digest with [12C]Propionyl-N-oxysuccinimide or [12C]Nicotinoyl-N-oxysuccinimide—4 μl of propionyl-N-oxysuccinimide or nicotinoyl-N-oxysuccinimide (0.15 m in Me2SO) was added to 75 μlof the endoproteinase digest (see above), and the solution was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, 4 μl of ammonium chloride (1 m) was added, and the mixture was incubated for a further 15 min. The pH was raised to 12 with NaOH (1 m) for 10 min, and the solution was then neutralized with the same amount of HCl (1 m). Capillary Liquid Chromatography and MALDI Target Preparation— Separation of the peptides was achieved with a capillary liquid chromatography system (Ultimate, LC Packings) and a reversed-phase column (LC Packings Pepmap reversed-phase C18 column; 15 cm length × 75 μm inner diameter). 25 μl of the peptide solution was injected and the peptides were trapped on a short reversed-phase column. For the separation of the peptides, the solvents A (0.05% TFA) and B (80% acetonitrile, 0.04% TFA) were used with a linear gradient from 10 to 100% B in 30 min with subsequent 20-min isocratic intervals at 100% B. The eluting peptides were spotted robotically onto a 192-well MALDI sample plate and mixed with a matrix solution (5 mg/ml of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) during the spotting process. The sample spots were dried at room temperature. Tandem Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer from Applied Biosystems (Framingham, MA) equipped with a neodymium-YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) laser that produces pulsed power at 355 nm at pulse rates of 200 Hz. Mass analysis was performed using the positive reflector mode with a deflection cutoff range of m/z 700. 5000 laser shots were accumulated to produce a single spectrum (Fig. 1). Subsequently, high energy MALDI-TOF/TOF collision-induced dissociation spectra were recorded on selected ions from the same sample spot. The collision energy was 2 keV. Air was used as the collision gas. Peptide Selection—Fig. 2 shows a schematic summary of the method we used for the determination of the stoichiometry of the U1 snRNP. The complex was denatured and digested completely with an endoproteinase. The proteolytic peptides were then labeled with an amine-specific 12C isotope-coded tag (18Wang S. Regnier F.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2001; 924: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Chakroborty A. Regnier F.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2002; 949: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Reference peptides were selected from the data base, synthesized, and labeled with a 13C isotope-coded tag. Mass spectrometric comparison of the intensities of the 12C- and 13C-labeled peptide pairs allows the absolute quantification of the peptides. The ratio of the absolute quantities of peptides resulting from different proteins corresponds to the stoichiometry of the proteins in the complex. In this study, we selected two peptides/protein from the protein sequences in the NCBI data base for the absolute quantification of all ten U1 proteins. The sequences of the peptides are shown in Tables I and II. We used the following selection criteria for the reference peptides. (i) No peptides starting with proline or glutamic acid were chosen, considering the possibility of incomplete cleavage by some endoproteinases (e.g. trypsin) before these amino acids. (ii) Amino acids that can be oxidized or transformed were avoided, such as methionine and tryptophan (which are easily oxidized) and N-terminal glutamine (which can be transformed into pyroglutamic acid). All the peptides chosen fulfill these requirements, except for the methionine-containing peptides 3–9 of SmD1 and peptides 73–80 and 13–23 of SmE. Peptides 10–20 and 66–86 of SmD1 and 81–92 of SmE, which would fit the criteria, could not be synthesized in sufficient purity. All reference peptides correspond to peptides that are expected to be produced from the spliceosomal proteins by endoproteinase digestion. As shown in Tables I and II, most peptides are created by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion. Alternatives were trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and Asp-N.Table IQuantification of human U1 snRNP labeled with [12C]propionyl-N-oxysuccinimideProteinPeptideExperiment 1Experiment 2EnzymepmolMean valuepmolMean valueU1-70KLRREFEVYGPIK (104-118)1.461.471.431.44Lys-CTLFVARVNYDTTESK (119-130)1.481.44Lys-CU1-CTTAAFQQGK (53-61)Not detectedLys-CDYYQK (36-40)Not detectedLys-CU1-AGTFVERDRK (99-107)1.531.531.251.25Lys-CSQETPATK (115-122)Not detectedLys-CSmBKRVLGLVLLRGE (64-75)Not detectedGlu-CVLGLVLLR (66-73)Not detectedTrypsinVPLAGAAGGPGIGR (98-108)Not detectedTrypsinSmD1LVRFLMK (3-9)1.571.571.381.38Lys-CSmD2DRYISK (93-98)1.461.461.441.44Lys-CNNTQVLINCRNNK (38-50)12.3412.79Lys-CSmD3NQGSGAGRGK (90-99)<0.0783<0.0688Lys-CVAQLEQVYIR (55-64)1.491.491.501.50TrypsinSmEQLGRIMLK (73-80)1.501.501.671.67Lys-CVMVQPINLIFR (13-23)Not detectedTrypsinSmFYIDGALSGHLGE (9-17)Not detectedGlu-CCNNVLYIR (65-73)Not detectedTrypsinSmGAHPPELK (4-10)1.601.601.301.30Lys-CHVQGILR (26-32)Not detectedTrypsin Open table in a new tab Table IIQuantification of human U1 snRNP labeled with [12C]nicotinoyl-N-oxysuccinimideProteinPeptideExperiment 1Experiment 2EnzymepmolMean valuepmolMean valueU1-70KLRREFEVYGPIK (104-118)1.831.671.521.53Lys-CTLFVARVNYDTTESK (119-130)1.511.54Lys-CU1-CTTAAFQQGK (53-61)1.381.591.251.32Lys-CDYYQK (36-40)1.791.38Lys-CU1-AGTFVERDRK (99-107)1.531.411.201.40Lys-CSQETPATK (115-122)1.301.59Lys-CSmBKRVLGLVLLRGE (64-75)1.651.481.381.37Glu-CVLGLVLLR (66-73)1.351.36TrypsinVPLAGAAGGPGIGR (95-108)< 0.0065< 0.0054TrypsinSmD1LVRFLMK (3-9)1.571.571.381.38Lys-CSmD2DRYISK (93-98)1.881.861.511.65Lys-CNNTQVLINCRNNK (38-50)11.5113.50Lys-CDSVIVVLRNPLIAGK (104-118)1.841.79Asp-NSmD3NQGSGAGRGK (90-99)< 0.00871.40< 0.0981.60Lys-CVAQLEQVYIR (55-64)1.401.60TrypsinSmEQLGRIMLK (73-80)1.731.551.531.51Lys-CVMVQPINLIFR (13-23)1.351.48TrypsinSmFYIDGALSGHLGE (9-17)0.0501.710.0351.23Glu-CCNNVLYIR (65-73)1.711.23TrypsinSmGAHPPELK (4-10)1.45/1.311.501.55/1.671.51Lys-C/TrypsinHVQGILR (26-32)1.541.46Trypsin Open table in a new tab Peptide Derivatization—There are two possibilities for the incorporation of stable isotopes into peptides: peptide synthesis using isotope-coded amino acids (such as [15N]-, [18O]-leucine) (8Gerber S.A. Rush J. Stemman O. Kirschner M.W. Gygi S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003; 100: 6940-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar) or derivatization of their side chains with isotope-coded reagents (22Aebersold R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Munchbach et al. (23Munchbach M. Quadroni M. Miotto G. James P. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 4047-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) describes the advantages of amine-specific isotope-coded reagents, such as d0/d4 nicotinoyl-N-oxysuccinimide carrying a fixed positive charge and increasing the mass spectrometric response for labeled peptides significantly, compared with the acetylated peptide as well as with their unlabeled counterpart. The increase in mass spectrometric response is most pronounced for small peptides (up to 10 amino acids), which can also be synthesized more reliably. The use of nicotinoylation may therefore result in an increase in sensitivity for the absolute quantification and stoichiometry determination, even for protein complexes that can only be isolated in low quantities. Determination of Optimal Conditions for Denaturation and Digestion—To determine the correct stoichiometry with this method, complete denaturation and digestion needs to be achieved for the U1 snRNP. Initially, urea was used for the denaturation of the complex. Urea is tolerated by several endoproteinases up to a concentration of 4 m, which allowed the digestion of the denatured protein complexes without prior dilution or dialysis (9Hochleitner E.O. Sondermann P. Lottspeich F. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, even with a concentration of 8 m urea, complete denaturation of the U1 snRNP was not achieved (data not shown). Therefore, 5 m guanidinium hydrochloride (GHCl) was tested. Because most endoproteinases already show a significant loss of activity at a concentration of 1 m, the denatured complex was diluted to 0.5 m GHCl with HEPES buffer. Subsequently, the enzyme was added and incubated overnight. After labeling with a 12C amine-specific tag, the digest was spiked with the synthetic peptides, which were derivatized with a 13C amine-specific tag. 0.36 μg of the complex was used in each experiment; assuming a hypothetical 1:1 stoichiometry of all complex constituents, this would correspond to ∼1.7 pmol of the complex. Approximately the same molar amounts of the reference peptides were added, which should therefore theoretically result in a similar intensity of the 12C- and 13C-labeled peptides, supposing the complex to have been pure and denaturation and digestion to have been complete. Figs. 3 and 4 show the MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the peptides acquired after liquid chromatographic separation, which demonstrated a similar intensity of the isotopic peptide pairs.Fig. 4MALDI-TOF mass spectra used for the absolute quantification of spliceosomal proteins SmG, U1-C, SmE, and SmB of the U1 snRNP. The U1 spliceosomal snRNP was denatured and then digested completely with endoproteinase Lys-C (U1-C, SmG), trypsin (SmG, SmE) and endoproteinase Glu-C (SmB) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting peptides were labeled with [12C]nicotinoyl-N-oxysuccinimide. Known amounts of synthetic peptides, labeled with the corresponding 13C isotope-coded tag were added (*Reference). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to absolutely quantify the proteins in the U1 spliceosomal snRNP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stoichiometry Determination Using Propionyl-N-oxysuccinimide—Table I summarizes the results of two independent experiments for the absolute quantification of the U1 proteins using propionyl-N-oxysuccinimide, using ∼0.36 μg of the complex/experiment. Half of all the peptides, however, could not be detected because of their low mass spectrometric response. Peptides from the proteins U1–70 K, U1-A, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, SmE, and SmG showed absolute amounts in the range of 1.25–1.67 pmol, suggesting 1:1 stoichiometries of these proteins in the complex. The observed deviations of approximately ±16% may be due to variations in sample handling, such as pipetting of peptide samples and dilutions. Peptides 38–50 of SmD2 showed a very high amount (12.4 pmol), which may have been due to solubility problems of the reference peptide. Concentrations below 0.069 pmol were found for peptides 90–99 of SmD3, which was attributed to arginine dimethylation of Arg-97 (12Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Lührmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Stoichiometry Determination Using Nicotinoyl-N-oxysuccinimide—To quantify all the proteins in the complex, the experiments were repeated with the same absolute amounts of the U1 snRNP as described above, replacing propionyl-N-oxysuccinimide with nicotinoyl-N-oxysuccinimide (Table II). In this case, all the peptides were detected; in particular, small peptides showed a significant increase in detectability as compared with propionyl-N-oxysuccinimide. One peptide of SmG (4–10, sequence: (K) AHPPELK), which is created by complete digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C or trypsin, was quantified in both digests. Quantification of this peptide in trypsin and endoproteinase Lys-C digests resulted in similar quantities (Table II), which suggests that the digestion was complete. In similarity to the experiments with propionyl-N-oxysuccinimide, mean absolute quantities of 1.40–1.86 pmol (Experiment 1) and 1.23–1.65 pmol (Experiment 2) were measured for most peptides. For peptides 95–108 of SmB and 90–99 of SmD3, quantities below 0.01 pmol were determined. This was ascribed to dimethylation of arginine 97 of SmD3 and arginine 108 of SmB (12Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Lührmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). For peptides 9–17 of SmF, a quantity of 0.035–0.05 pmol was found. This peptide contains aspartic acid, which is also cleaved by endoproteinase Glu-C to a lesser extent. For peptides 38–50 of SmD2, very high quantities (11.5–13.5 pmol) were found. These data also demonstrated that one peptide/protein may be insufficient for the reliable absolute quantification of a protein. A third peptide-(104–118) from SmD2 was therefore quantified, resulting in 1.79–1.84 pmol, which is comparable with the quantity of peptides 93–98 (1.65–1.88 pmol). Recently, we described a method for the determination of the stoichiometry of protein complexes. Absolute quantification of the complex constituents was achieved by comparing the areas of fluorescently labeled peptides resulting from different proteins in the fluorescence chromatogram. This method was used for the determination of the stoichiometry of the complex of hFc1 and sFcγRIII (9Hochleitner E.O. Sondermann P. Lottspeich F. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The method allows relatively fast stoichiometry determination of complexes consisting of a moderate number of proteins. Although cysteine-specific rather than amine-specific labeling reduced significantly the complexity of the fluorescently labeled peptide mixture resulting from hFc1 and sFcγRIII, the number of peptides resulting from very large multiprotein complexes may still be too high to allow a good separation. Therefore, we tested the strategy depicted in Fig. 2 for stoichiometry determination of multiprotein complexes. Because reference peptides have to be synthesized for this approach, this method is more time-consuming than the fluorescence method; however, it overcomes several limitations for the analysis of large multiprotein complexes. First of all, it is absolutely compatible with multidimensional separations. Losses of peptides during the transfer from the first to the second dimension have no influence on the absolute quantification, because the 13C-labeled synthetic reference peptides show chromatographic behavior identical to that of their 12C-labeled counterparts. Furthermore, even poorly separated peptides in the chromatogram can be quantified, because the quantification is based on the comparison of the mass spectrometric intensities belonging to the isotopic peptide pairs. A similar approach was suggested for absolute quantification in proteomics, using isotope-coded affinity tag-labeled idiotypic synthetic reference peptides as internal standards (22Aebersold R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, several circumstances should be considered when using this approach for absolute protein quantification. Complete denaturation and digestion of the complex is a prerequisite for absolute quantification and stoichiometry determination. Furthermore, because unmodified synthetic peptides are used for quantification, unexpected post-translational modifications of the proteolytic peptides can falsify the result in quantification of the protein. The use of absolute quantification on a proteome-wide scale may therefore still be problematic. Multiprotein complexes, however, consist of a moderate number of proteins, which are usually better characterized. Another issue is that of miscleavage by endoproteinases, such as chymotryptic activity in trypsin or endoproteinase Glu-C cleavage at aspartic acid. Therefore, we used in this study two or more peptides/protein for the absolute quantification of most proteins. We found similar absolute quantities for all ten proteins, suggesting equal stoichiometries of all ten proteins in the U1 snRNP, including U1-C. For quantification of the SmB protein, only peptides derived from sequences common to both SmB and SmB′ were used. Consequently, there is only one type of SmB protein in the Sm core, and SmB can be replaced by SmB′ or vice versa. Because Coomassie-stained gels of electrophoretically separated snRNP proteins always show the two proteins SmB and SmB′ as two bands of equal intensity (see Fig. 1), the two proteins are present in approximately similar amounts. The 1:1 stoichiometry of the Sm proteins is in good agreement with a model proposing that the Sm proteins form a heptamer ring with a single copy of each Sm protein in the snRNPs (14Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 15Walke S. Bragado-Nilsson E. Seraphin B. Nagai K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A 1:1 stoichiometry is also in best agreement with the three-dimensional structure of U1 snRNP derived from single particle electron cryomicroscopy (16Stark H. Dube P. Lührmann R. Kastner B. Nature. 2001; 409: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the stoichiometric analysis does not exclude the possibility that two kinds of U1 snRNP are present in equal amounts: one with two copies of the protein U1-C protein and the other with none. Nevertheless, this possibility can be excluded, because the ion exchange chromatography used here to purify U1 snRNP separated U1 snRNPs lacking protein U1-C from those containing it (Ref. 21Bach M. Bringmann P. Lührmann R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 232-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and data not shown). The method described here should therefore be well suited for the determination of the stoichiometric composition of a variety of snRNPs and (spliceosomal) multi-protein complexes. We thank Henning Urlaub for helpful discussions, Thomas Conrad for excellent technical assistance, and Miwako Tamura for peptide synthesis and purification."
https://openalex.org/W2133967515,"One of the most intriguing steps during cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis is the ring contraction process that leads to the extrusion of one of the integral macrocyclic carbon atoms from the tetrapyrrole-derived framework. The aerobic cobalamin pathway requires the action of a monooxygenase called CobG (precorrin-3B synthase), which generates a hydroxylactone intermediate that is subsequently ring-contracted by CobJ. However, in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, which harbors an aerobic-like pathway, there is no cobG in the main cobalamin biosynthetic operon although it does contain an additional uncharacterized gene called orf663. To demonstrate the involvement of Orf663 in cobalamin synthesis, the first dedicated 10 genes of the B12 pathway (including orf663), encoding enzymes for the transformation of uroporphyrinogen III into hydrogenobyrinic acid (HBA), were sequentially cloned into a plasmid to generate an artificial operon, which, when transformed into Escherichia coli, endowed the host with the ability to make HBA. Deletion of orf663 from this operon prevented HBA synthesis, demonstrating that it was essential for corrin construction. HBA synthesis was restored to this recombinant strain either by returning orf663 or by substituting it with cobG. Recombinant overproduction of Orf663, now renamed CobZ, allowed the characterization of a novel cofactor-rich protein, housing two Fe-S centers, a flavin, and a heme group, which like B12 itself is a modified tetrapyrrole. A mechanism for Orf663 (CobZ) in cobalamin biosynthesis is proposed.

A mechanism for Orf663 (CobZ) in cobalamin biosynthesis is proposed. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a modified tetrapyrrole and belongs to the same class of compounds as heme, chlorophyll, siroheme, and coenzyme F430 (1Warren M.J. Scott A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 486-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Modified tetrapyrroles are synthesized via a branched biosynthetic pathway, with 5-aminolevulinic acid the first common intermediate and uroporphyrinogen III the first branchpoint step in the pathway (1Warren M.J. Scott A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 486-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The structural complexity of vitamin B12 means that its biosynthesis remains one of most enigmatic and exigent metabolic pathways in nature, requiring around 30 enzymes for the complete de novo construction of the coenzyme form (2Warren M.J. Raux E. Schubert H.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 390-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). For cobalamin biosynthesis two distinct yet similar routes exist, known as the oxygen-dependent (aerobic) and oxygen-independent (anaerobic) pathways (3Blanche F. Thibaut D. Debussche L. Hertle R. Zipfel F. Müller G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1651-1653Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These pathways diverge at precorrin-2 and merge again at adenosylcobyric acid. The major differences between these pathways include the timing of cobalt insertion, the requirement for molecular oxygen, and the nature of the extruded carbon fragment, which is lost during the ring contraction process (4Wang J. Stolowich N.J. Santander P.J. Park J.H. Scott A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14320-14322Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These biochemical differences are also reflected at the genetic level, where the presence of certain genes offers a diagnosis of the type of pathway in operation. Thus pathways that operate the aerobic route to B12 always contain the genes cobN, -S, and -T, which encode the subunits of a cobaltochelatase that can insert cobalt into a ring-contracted tetrapyrrole-derived macrocycle (5Debussche L. Couder M. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7445-7451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cobG, which encodes a monooxygenase required for synthesizing the hydroxylated γ-lactone derivative of precorrin-3 (6Scott A.I. Roessner C.A. Stolowich N.J. Spencer J.B. Min C. Ozaki S.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CobG 1The abbreviations used are: CobG, precorrin-3B synthase; CobZ, gene product of orf663 and an enzyme isofunctional protein to CobG, but containing flavin and heme group as well as Fe-S centers; HBA, hydrogenobyrinic acid.1The abbreviations used are: CobG, precorrin-3B synthase; CobZ, gene product of orf663 and an enzyme isofunctional protein to CobG, but containing flavin and heme group as well as Fe-S centers; HBA, hydrogenobyrinic acid. (precorrin-3B synthase) was identified initially from sequencing of the cobalamin biosynthetic operons in Pseudomonas denitrificans (7Debussche L. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7430-7440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 46 kDa and displays some sequence similarity to sulfite reductase, including a motif for a Fe-S center (7Debussche L. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J.

The role of CobG in cobalamin synthesis was demonstrated when it was shown that it converted precorrin-3A into a compound with an extra 16 mass units (precorrin-3B), corresponding to the inclusion of an oxygen atom (8Debussche L. Thibaut D. Danzer M. Debu F. Frechet D. Herman F. Blanche F. Vuilhorgne M. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; : 1100-1103Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of precorrin-3B was determined from multiple 13C labeling studies coupled with infrared spectroscopy, revealing that the product of the reaction catalyzed by CobG contained a γ-lactone attached to ring A and a hydroxy group at C-20 (6Scott A.I. Roessner C.A. Stolowich N.J. Spencer J.B. Min C. Ozaki S.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Debussche L. Thibaut D. Danzer M. Debu F. Frechet D. Herman F. Blanche F. Vuilhorgne M. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; : 1100-1103Crossref Google Scholar). Further oxygen labeling experiments proved conclusively that the latter was derived from molecular oxygen and that CobG was therefore a monooxygenase (6Scott A.I. Roessner C.A. Stolowich N.J. Spencer J.B. Min C. Ozaki S.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Despite its discovery more than a decade ago, comparatively little is known about the mechanism of CobG. However, in Rhodobacter capsulatus and a number of α-proteobacteria, genome sequencing projects have revealed the presence of cobalamin pathways that appear aerobic in character, but are missing an orthologue of cobG. In this project we sought to try and overproduce the enzymes found in the main R. capsulatus cobalamin operon (9Vlcek C. Paces V. Maltsev N. Paces J. Haselkorn R. Fonstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9384-9388Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in Escherichia coli to genetically engineer a strain with a capacity to synthesize hydrogenobyrinic acid (HBA) in vivo and thereby identify the protein required for initiating the ring contraction process. Most chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Other materials were provided by the following suppliers: restriction enzymes and modification enzymes were from Promega, Chilworth, Southampton, United Kingdom; pKK223.3, chelating-Sepharose fast flow resin and gel filtration columns were from Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK; pET14b was from Novagen, Madison, WI; tryptone and yeast extract were from Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK; sodium dithionite was from Roche, Poole, UK; and primers were from Invitrogen, Paisley, UK. For the production of HBA, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the two compatible plasmids pKK223–3:RccobHIKLEM-JAForf663 and pBAD33:PdecobAI. Plasmid pKK223–3:RccobHIKLEMJAForf663 was constructed by inserting the appropriate amplified R. capsulatus genes into pKK223-3 (ColE1 ori, lacPO, AmpR) using the “Link and Lock” method, which allows the consecutive cloning of genes with the reuse of the same restriction enzyme sites (see Fig. 2). The first gene to be cloned is amplified with primers containing an EcoRI at the 5′ and SpeI and BamHI sites at the 3′ end. The remaining genes are amplified with primers containing an XbaI at the 5′ end and SpeI and BamHI sites on the 3′ end. After cloning the first gene into the plasmid via the EcoRI and BamHI sites, the remaining genes, cut with XbaI and BamHI restriction enzymes, were cloned consecutively into the plasmid after it had been restricted with SpeI and BamHI. The SpeI- and XbaI-restricted fragments form compatible cohesive ends, which after ligation do not reform a restriction site. Thus by fusing the SpeI and XbaI sites, these sites can be reused in subsequent cloning steps (so long as the sites do not occur naturally within the gene). Plasmid pBAD33:cobAI was constructed by cutting a DNA fragment bearing the two genes from pUC18:cobAI (10Roessner C.A. Park J.H. Scott A.I. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2215-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) with KpnI and PstI and ligating it into pBAD33 (11Guzman L-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar) (p15A ori, pBAD, ChlR). An orf663 minus strain was constructed in a similar manner except that the large plasmid did not contain orf663. The orf663 minus strain was also transformed with a third compatible plasmid, pZS*24 (pSC101 ori, Plac/ara1, KanR) (12Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 6: 1203-1210Crossref Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), bearing either orf663 or the P. denitrificans cobG gene. E. coli strains were grown with aeration at 37 °C in LB medium containing 0.2% glucose plus the appropriate antibiotics (50 mg/liter ampicillin, 30 mg/liter chloramphenicol, 50 mg/liter kanamycin) to an A600 = 1 and the cells collected by centrifugation. The combined cell pellets from 4 liters of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth were resuspended in 1 liter of minimal medium consisting of M9 salts containing the same antibiotics plus the following additives: 0.2% glycerol, 0.2% l-(+)-arabinose, 0.01% yeast extract, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 20 mg of 5-aminolevulinic acid, and 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells in minimal medium were incubated with aeration at 37 °C for 24–48 h. The products found in both the culture medium and in the heated (80 °C for 15 min) cell lysate were isolated by binding them to DEAE-Sephadex. HBA was esterified and purified by TLC as previously described (13Roessner C.A. Spencer J.B. Stolowich N.J. Wang J. Nayar G.P. Santander P.J. Pichon C. Min C. Holderman M.T. Scott A.I. Chem. Biol. 1994; 1: 119-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HBA was purified in its free acid form and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography on a BDS Hypersil C-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Thermo Electron Corporation) run on a Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD Trap equipped with a diode array detector and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1 with a gradient of acetonitrile in 1 m ammonium acetate. E. coli cells transformed with the plasmid expressing the R. capsulatus Orf663 were grown overnight on LB medium, and were harvested and concentrated by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 × g in a refrigerated Sorvall RC-5 centrifuge. The pellet was washed with 10 volumes of a 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl and then concentrated by a second centrifugation run at 5000 × g for 15 min in a 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). The cell pellet was broken by four passages through a French press operating at 12,000 psi, under an argon atmosphere, to obtain a homogenous cell lysate. The unbroken material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 × g. The pellet was kept. The supernatant was subjected to a further centrifugation at 88,000 × g for 1 h in a Sorvall Combi-plus ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was yellow in color and contained the soluble flavin-binding fragment of the Orf663. The flavin-binding fragment of the protein was further purified and concentrated by affinity chromatography on a His-bind column. The pellet, dark-red in color, contained the full-length form of Orf663. This was salt-washed in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl buffer, and then centrifuged at 88,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended and homogenized in a 100 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5. The membrane fraction was then solubilized by the mild detergent n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside for 30 min with continuous gentle stirring. The final detergent concentration was 1% (w/v) and the protein concentration was adjusted to 4 mg/ml after measuring the absorption at 280 nm. The material that had not been solubilized by the detergent treatment was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 88,000 × g. The full-length form of Orf663 was then purified from the cleared supernatant by affinity chromatography on a His-bind column. The protein was eluted in a buffer containing 200 mm imidazole, 0.003% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. The protein was concentrated and the excess imidazole removed by dialysis. The samples for spectroscopic analysis were prepared after concentration. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance—The continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Alexis E580 spectrometer operating at X-band (9.7 MHz, 300 millitesla) equipped with an Oxford Helium flow cryostat. The precise experimental conditions are given in the figure legends. The temperature is controlled by an Oxford ITC unit. The samples for EPR measurements were either frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after the preparation (oxidized), or incubated for 30 min in the presence of the reductant sodium dithionite (11.5 mm) under anaerobic conditions, and stored in liquid nitrogen. UV-Visible Spectroscopy—The optical spectra were either recorded on a Hitachi (Model U-3310) spectrophotometer equipped with an attachment for the measurement of highly scattering solutions. The samples were kept under a gentle argon stream to maintain the anaerobic conditions. Redox titrations were performed in a Belle Technology glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere, essentially as described previously (14Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). All solutions were degassed under vacuum with argon. Oxygen levels were maintained at less than 2 ppm. The protein solution (∼5 μm) in 8 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, was titrated electrochemically according to the method of Dutton (15Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) using sodium dithionite as reductant and potassium ferricyanide as oxidant. Absorption versus potential data at appropriate wavelengths (reflecting maximal changes in spectral properties between oxidized and reduced enzyme) were fitted to the Nernst equation to derive the apparent midpoint reduction potential (E) for the 1 electron reduction of the bound heme iron. After growing R. capsulatus under both chemoheterotrophic (aerobic) and phototrophic (anaerobic) conditions we observed that cobalamin accumulated to similar levels within the cells under both sets of conditions (11 pmol per A600 unit), indicating that this organism can make cobalamin even in the presence of low concentrations of molecular oxygen. This result coupled to the observation that R. capsulatus does not contain an orthologue of cobG (9Vlcek C. Paces V. Maltsev N. Paces J. Haselkorn R. Fonstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9384-9388Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), utilized by other bacteria operating an aerobic cobalamin biosynthetic pathway (16Rodionov D.A. Vitreschak A.G. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41148-41159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), suggests that it may employ an alternative system to help promote ring contraction. Significantly, within the main cobalamin operon there is a candidate gene (orf663) that may encode such a surrogate. To determine whether Orf663 is involved in corrin synthesis, 10 R. capsulatus genes thought to be required for HBA synthesis from uroporphyrinogen III were introduced into pKK233.3 using a newly developed multicloning procedure that we have termed Link and Lock (Fig. 2) because genes can be linked together and locked in position with the use of a minimal number of restriction enzymes. The enzymes required to convert 5-aminolevulinic acid to uroporphyrinogen III are provided by the host, and the large plasmid was transformed into an E. coli strain harboring another plasmid bearing the cobA and cobI genes necessary to convert uroporphyrinogen III to precorrin-3A to provide sufficient amounts of this intermediate and to facilitate high flux through the pathway (10Roessner C.A. Park J.H. Scott A.I. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2215-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The resulting strain was found to produce comparatively large quantities of HBA, the first intermediate on the pathway to cobalamin that is stable and can be easily isolated (17Blanche F. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Debussche L. Thibaut D. Vuilhorgne M. Leeper F.J. Battersby A.R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 383-411Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). HBA was isolated both as a free acid and in its esterified form and its structure confirmed on the basis of its UV-visible, mass, and NMR spectra (Fig. 3). The branch of enteric taxa to which E. coli belongs is thought to have lost the ability to make cobalamin de novo some time ago, although some members of this group such as Salmonella sp. would appear to have reacquired the ability through horizontal transfer of the anaerobic cob operon (18Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has also been shown that E. coli can make B12de novo after transformation of the bacterium with a plasmid containing this cob operon (19Raux E. Lanois A. Levillayer F. Warren M.J. Brody E. Rambach A. Thermes C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, endowing E. coli with the capability to synthesize HBA is much more of a challenge, because HBA is a compound that E. coli has never made before. Moreover, HBA is made under aerobic conditions unlike the anaerobic conditions required for the genetically engineered E. coli to make cobalamin (19Raux E. Lanois A. Levillayer F. Warren M.J. Brody E. Rambach A. Thermes C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Having an E. coli strain with the ability to make HBA also allowed us to address the question of whether the R. capsulatus Orf663 was required for HBA synthesis. Deleting orf663 resulted in a strain that no longer accumulated HBA. Significantly, HBA synthesis could be restored either by reintroduction of orf663 or by addition of the P. denitrificans cobG gene. Thus, cobG and orf663 encode enzymes that are isofunctional. On the basis that the R. capuslatus Orf663 is a cobalamin biosynthetic enzyme and that it is quite distinct from the P. denitrificans CobG (see below), we propose that Orf663 should be called CobZ. The protein encoded by cobZ (orf663) is therefore able to catalyze a reaction similar to that enhanced by CobG, i.e. it has the ability to generate a hydroxylactone derivative of precorrin-3A (Fig. 1) (6Scott A.I. Roessner C.A. Stolowich N.J. Spencer J.B. Min C. Ozaki S.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus CobG and CobZ are alternative precorrin-3B synthases. However, CobZ (Orf663) must mediate this reaction in a manner very different from that employed by CobG, because the two proteins display no primary sequence similarity. Moreover, CobZ (866 amino acids) is considerably larger than CobG (459 amino acids). A detailed bioinformatics analysis reveals that CobZ is composed of two distinct moieties, an N-terminal flavin-binding region that displays substantial similarity to succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase and a C-terminal region that is an integral membrane protein with similarity to proteins of unknown function (originally called CitB but now called TcuB-see below (20Lewis J.A. Horswill A.R. Schwem B.E. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). At the junction between these two domains is a cysteine-rich region that has the same consensus motif for a 2[4Fe-4S] cluster as found in a number of complex redox proteins, such as heterodisulfide reductase. In some organisms, CobZ displays similarity to two separate proteins that are found as part of an operon recently identified as being involved in the metabolism of tricarballylate (20Lewis J.A. Horswill A.R. Schwem B.E. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a compound that is catabolized by some mircroorganisms as a source of carbon and energy (21Gutnick D. Calvo J.M. Klopotowski T. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 215-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tricarballylate utilization operon (tcu) contains three genes, tcuA, -B, and -C, where tcuA and tcuB align with the N and C termini of CobZ (20Lewis J.A. Horswill A.R. Schwem B.E. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, TcuA is predicted to contain a flavin, whereas TcuB is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with several Fe-S centers. A detailed molecular genetics study of this operon provides convincing evidence that TcuA and -B are involved in the metabolism of tricarballylate, possibly via its oxidation to cis-aconitate (20Lewis J.A. Horswill A.R. Schwem B.E. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this respect, TcuA and TcuB have been suggested to function in the dehydrogenation of tricarballylate. To progress from an in silico predictive model of CobZ to experimental in vitro reality, cobZ was cloned to allow overproduction of CobZ as a recombinant protein in E. coli with an N-terminal His tag. Cells overproducing CobZ appeared to accumulate two proteins, one of the expected mass of 90 kDa and another of 50 kDa. Subsequent analysis revealed that the 50-kDa protein was a proteolytic fragment resulting from the cleavage of the 90-kDa protein product. This proteolysis is consistent with CobZ consisting of two distinct moieties, where the junction between them represents a region that is susceptible to cleavage. The N-terminal proteolytic fragment was purified and shown to house a flavin molecule (Fig. 4A). Although the yellow coloration and UV-visible spectrum of this region of CobZ are typical of a flavin cofactor, it is not feasible to identify the particular type of flavin bound by this information alone. However, FMN has a 10-fold higher fluorescence at 600 nm than FAD thus allowing the flavin nucleotide to be differentiated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Moreover, FAD can be broken down into its FMN and AMP moieties, which therefore results in a 10-fold increase in the fluorescence (22Chapman S.K. Welsh F. Moysey R. Mowat C. Doherty M.K. Turner K.L. Munro A.W. Reid G.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A purified sample of the CobZ N-terminal peptide was treated with trifluoroacetic acid and, once the precipitated protein had been removed by centrifugation, half was neutralized and its fluorescence spectrum measured at 600 nm. The other half of the sample was left to hydrolyze any FAD into its FMN and AMP components over a 4-h period, neutralized, and its fluorescence also measured. A comparison of the spectral readings revealed that the fluorescence had increased 10-fold. This result demonstrates that the flavin component of CobZ is FAD and also indicates that it is unlikely to be covalently bound to the protein. The comparatively large quantities of the 50-kDa fragment obtained during the purification procedure allowed an initial investigation into the role played by the flavin cofactor. The purified 50-kDa protein was concentrated to ∼2 mg/ml in buffer containing 200 mm imidazole and was titrated at 4 °C against an increasing concentration of sodium dithionite under anaerobic conditions. The titration against dithionite revealed that the flavin was reduced directly to the 2 electron reduced hydroquinone form, which can be deduced from the bleaching of the flavin chromophore with no evidence of any semiquinone formation during the reduction (Fig. 4B). A neutral or blue semiquinone would have been observed by the appearance of a band at 580–620 nm, whereas the anionic red semiquinone would have been identified by strong absorption features in the region around 380–400 nm. Moreover, the flavin can be returned to its fully oxidized state by addition of oxygen (data not shown) without any noticeable accumulation of semiquinone signal. This result is consistent with the flavin being involved in a 2-electron reduction process rather than two single electron steps, although we cannot rule out the possibility that semiquinone form(s) are transiently populated at this stage. The truncated flavin module of the protein was also incubated with NADH, to see if this could act as a reductant. Many flavoproteins are reduced by NADH or NADPH as part of their catalytic cycle (e.g. cytochrome P450 reductase (23Ost T.W. Miles C.S. Munro A.W. Murdoch J. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13421-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). However, incubation of the N-terminal truncated version of CobZ with NADH did not lead to any noticeable reduction of the flavin as monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. The N-terminal region of CobZ would therefore not appear to interact directly with NADH (or else be oxidized much faster than it is reduced by NADH), so it probably operates another method for the reduction of the flavin. The insolubility of CobZ is likely because of the fact that the C-terminal region is an integral membrane protein, as hydropathy plots predict that CobZ has at least six hydrophobic regions, all located within the C-terminal region. This would also be consistent with observations that the N terminus is cleaved, yielding a soluble 50-kDa fragment, whereas the rest (C-terminal) remains in the membrane. To test the hypothesis that CobZ may be a membrane protein, an extraction with detergent was undertaken. The extraction of CobZ was achieved with n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and the protein was passed through a Ni2+-affinity column to improve purity, because the intact protein was overproduced as an N-terminal His-tagged fusion. About 1–2 mg of purified CobZ could be obtained per liter of bacterial culture, which had been induced for a short 3-h period, to minimize degradation. The purified CobZ was analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 4A). The color of the protein appeared more orange/red than the bright yellow of the purified 50-kDa N-terminal region. The difference in color was presumed to be because of the Fe-S clusters. However, the UV-visible spectrum of CobZ revealed a very strong absorbance around 414 nm, consistent with the presence of an oxidized heme group. Reduction of the protein with dithionite resulted in a long wavelength shift of the Soret band from 414 to 425 nm, together with a considerable increase in the intensity of the α band absorption at 560 nm (Fig. 5). The EPR spectrum of the oxidized form of CobZ also shows the presence of a cytochrome in the low spin state (data not shown). The measured g values of gz = 2.94, gy = 2.25, and gx = 1.50 are consistent with a low spin heme and suggest a bis-His coordination (24Gadsby P.M. Thomson A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5003-5011Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the low spin state may be an artifact of the purification as the protein was purified in buffer containing imidazole. Nonetheless, extensive dialysis and gel filtration of the protein did not significantly alter the spectral characteristics of the heme, suggestin"
https://openalex.org/W2053168726,"The mammalian transcriptional coactivator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) functions in concert with Oct-1 and VP16 to assemble the herpes simplex virus (HSV) immediate early (IE) transcription enhancer core complexes that mediate the high level transcription of these genes upon infection. Although this transcriptional model has been well characterized in vitro, the requirements and significance of the components have not been addressed.

Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4065-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Triezenberg S.J. LaMarco K.L. McKnight S.L.

However, the regulatory potential of these factors is dependent upon the enhancer core, suggesting that interactions or activities of the core components are required for their synergistic stimulation of the IE gene transcription. Based upon the in vitro assembly model, it would be expected that Oct-1 would be an essential component of the viral regulatory circuit. However the expression of the viral IE genes is induced in a VP16-dependent manner during infection of Oct-1-deficient cells, suggesting that this component is important but that alternative mechanisms exist (14Nogueira M.L. Wang V.E. Tantin D Sharp P.A. Kristie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because HCF-1 interacts with GABP and Sp1 as well as VP16, it remained possible that this component was the common primary determinant of the IE gene transcription (8Kristie T.M. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6525-6534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vogel J.L. Kristie T.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Gunther M. Laithier M.

HCF-1 is a unique cellular complex consisting of polypeptides derived from a 230-kDa precursor protein by site-specific proteolytic processing (10Wilson A.C. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W.

The protein was originally identified as being required for the formation of the stable IE EC complex. Later, it was shown to be the target for cellular transcription factors GABP (15Vogel J.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1645-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), and to function as a transcription coactivator. HCF-1 has also been implicated in the control of multiple stages of cell cycle progression that may be a reflection of the protein's transcriptional functions (26Goto H. Motomura S. Wilson A.C.

Cell. 2004; 14: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In support of this, array studies have implicated HCF-1 in the expression of critical cellular proteins involved in general transcription, mRNA splicing, DNA replication-repair, and signal transduction (30Khurana B. Kristie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33673-33683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The requirement and significance of HCF-1 for IE gene expression was addressed by selective RNA interference-dependent depletion. It was striking that the depletion of HCF-1 abrogated HSV IE gene expression mediated by Oct-1-VP16, GABP, and Sp1. The stringent requirement for HCF-1 in the face of multiple regulatory factors indicates that these genes exemplify a layer of regulation in which the coactivator is the critical component. More strikingly, whereas HCF-1 functions as the mediator for such general factors as GABP and Sp1, this activity is specific for the combinatorial context of the IE genes. In a manner analogous to HSV, the IE62 gene of the related α herpesvirus VZV also contains reiterated inducible enhancer cores that assemble complexes containing HCF-1, Oct-1, and ORF10 (VZV ortholog of VP16) (31Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4693-4701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, however, the VZV IE62 gene product also contributes to the induction of its own expression and to the expression of the majority of VZV genes. As for HSV, depletion of HCF-1 demonstrated that the protein was required for the VZV ORF10 and IE62 activation of the VZV IE62 promoter, indicating that HCF-1 determines a critical common stage in human α herpesvirus IE gene transcription. These results have general implications for the HSV IE gene transcriptional model and the initiation of the viral lytic replication cycle. In this context, the availability of HCF-1 in a given cell would represent a critical determinant in the initiation of lytic cycle. More significantly, HCF-1 is specifically sequestered in the cytoplasm of sensory neurons, the site of HSV and VZV latency. The data presented here support the model whereby the cytoplasmic localization of HCF-1 would promote the establishment of viral latency and the regulated transport of this coactivator to the nucleus would be a critical stage in the induction of the viral IE genes during the reactivation stage (32Kristie T.M. Vogel J.L. Sears A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Virus—HeLa, BSC-1, and Vero cells were maintained according to standard procedures. HSV-1(F) stocks were produced and titered in Vero cells. VZV (Webster) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Silencer Constructs and Transfections—pU6-si-HCF-1 contained the si-HCF-1 sequence GGGACATTCCCATCACTTACG in pBS-U6-si (gift of Y. Shi, Harvard University) (33Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). pU6-si-sc1 and pU6-si-sc2 contained the control scrambled si-RNA sequences GGGTACATCCTGTATACTAC and GGGATCCATTATCTGTACAC respectively. pH1-4-si-HCF-1 contained the si-HCF-1 sequence CCTGGATACCATGGCCTGG in pSUPER (gift of R. Agami, Netherlands Cancer Institute) (34Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Transfections were done using FuGENE as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Reporter and Expression Plasmids—pGL3-TATA contained the HSV thymidine kinase minimal promoter (-49 to +33). All luciferase reporters were derived by insertion of the appropriate binding site elements into pGL3-TATA as follows: EC (CCGTGCATGCTAATGATATTCCTTTGGGGG), GABP (GTTAGCATGCGGAACGGAAGCGGAAACCACCGGAT, dimer element), GABP-EC (CGGAAGCGGAAACCACCGGATCGGGCGGTAATGAGATGCCATGC), SP1 (GGGGCGGGCCCGCCTGGGGGGCGGGGGGC), and VZV EC (TCATATGTAAATGAAATCACATG). pGL3b-CMV and pGL3b-RSV contained the CMV IE and RSV-LTR promoter-luciferase reporters, respectively. pIE62-45 contained the VZV IE62 promoter from -61 to +73 in pGL3-basic. pCMV-VP16 and pCMV-VP16-NLS contained the HSV VP16 coding sequence (gift of J. L. C. McKnight) under the control of CMV IE promoter in pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) and pCMV/Myc/Nuc (Invitrogen), respectively. pCMV-ORF10 and pCMV-IE62 contained the VZV ORF10 and IE62 coding sequences (35Arvin A.M.

Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Virology. 1992; 191: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Western Blots—Equivalent amounts of radioimmunoprecipitation assay-soluble protein extracts were probed with antibodies to HCF-1 (Ab2131), GAPDH (Research Diagnostic Incorp.), ICP4 (Virusys Corp), and ICP0 (Virusys Corp). The blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary and the ECL Plus Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon Imaging System and Image Quant software (Amersham Biosciences) and was normalized to endogenous GAPDH. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were transfected with 100 ng of pU6-si-HCF-1 or the control vectors. At the indicated times after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained with anti-HCF-1 (Ab2131) as described previously (18Kristie T.M. Pomerantz J.L. Twomey T.C. Parent S.A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4387-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were infected at 48 h after transfection with HSV-1(F) at 10 pfu/cell for 5 h before fixation and staining. For the detection of VP16 and VP16-NLS, cells were transfected with pU6-si-HCF-1 or pU6-si. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were transfected with pCMV-VP16 or pCMV-VP16-NLS. The cells were costained with anti-HCF-1 and anti-VP16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 24 h later. In all cases, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was added during mounting. Images were collected using a Leica TCS-SP1 confocal microscope, and fluorescence quantitation was done using Leica Confocal Software v2.5.1227.0. Viral Titers and Plaque Assays—Viral yields from infection of HCF-1 depleted and control HeLa cells were determined according to standard procedures. VZV plaque assays were done by infection of control and HCF-1 depleted BSC-1 cells (2.5 × 105) with 80 tissue culture infectious dose 50% end point (a measure of the viral titer) and incubation in Earle's modified Eagle's media with 1% fetal bovine serum. After 6 days, the plaques were counted, and the plaque sizes were determined using a Leica microscope with a Zeiss Axiovert camera and ImagePro 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Reporter Assays—HeLa cells were transfected with 100 ng of pU6-si-HCF-1 or pU6-si. 48 h later, the cells were cotransfected with the reporter constructs and the indicated activator (VP16, VP16-NLS, ORF10, or IE62) or control vector. At 24 h after transfection, the reporter gene activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) in a Berthold luminometer. All activity units were normalized by protein concentration and by control promoter activity. The data presented are representative of several independent experiments. RNA Interference-mediated Depletion of HCF-1—In vitro studies have suggested that the expression of the HSV-1 IE genes is dependent upon the synergistic interaction of multiple factors and the assembly of multiprotein enhancer core complexes. Using Oct-1-deficient cells, it was determined previously that this component was critical but not essential for viral IE gene expression, suggesting that multiple-alternative regulatory pathways exist (14Nogueira M.L. Wang V.E. Tantin D Sharp P.A. Kristie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in vitro protein interactions have suggested that the coactivator HCF-1 might represent an essential component that is common to these various mechanisms. Because HCF-1 is a ubiquitously expressed mammalian cell protein, the requirements for this coactivator component in the regulation of HSV IE genes was investigated by specifically depleting the protein in cells using RNA interference methods. As shown in Fig. 1A, constructs expressing HCF-1 specific silencer RNAs or control scrambled RNAs from the U6 promoter were transfected into cells, and the levels of HCF-1 were monitored by Western blot. The levels of HCF-1 were specifically reduced in cells transfected with the si-HCF-1 over the course of 48 h after transfection. In contrast, the control scrambled si-RNAs had no effect on the HCF-1 levels. The specific reduction in HCF-1 expression was clearly evident in cells cotransfected with the si-HCF-1 construct and GFP (Fig. 1B)in which cells expressing GFP were progressively depleted for HCF-1 over 72 h. Depletion of HCF-1 Abrogates HSV-1 IE Gene Expression— The dependence of HSV IE expression on HCF-1 was addressed by transfection of cells with constructs expressing the si-HCF-1 or the control construct. 72 h after transfection, the cells were infected or mock-infected with 0.1 or 1.0 pfu/cell for 5 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, an 80% depletion of HCF-1 resulted in reduced expression of the IE proteins ICP4 and ICP0 to 8-10% of the expression in control transfected cells (0.1 pfu/cell). Like-wise, infection of HCF-1-depleted cells at 0.1 pfu/cell resulted in a significant reduction in HSV viral yields (∼2 log) at 18 h after infection (data not shown). The results suggested that the expression of the viral IE genes was critically dependent upon the levels of HCF-1. At higher multiplicities of infection (1.0 pfu), however, the expression of the IE proteins and the viral yields were only slightly reduced in the infected culture. It is likely that this reflects the infection of the total cell population, in which only a percentage of cells was significantly depleted for HCF-1. In addition, high levels of viral template and encapsidated VP16 may compete for residual HCF-1 in partially depleted cells. Therefore, cells were transfected with si-HCF-1 or control constructs and infected with HSV-1 at 10 pfu/cell. The levels of HCF-1 and the expression of the viral IE ICP4 were monitored by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B). It was striking that cells that were significantly depleted for HCF-1 (>80%) also exhibited a lack of HSV IE gene expression, demonstrating that HCF-1-depleted cells supported no significant viral IE gene expression. HCF-1 Is Required for VP16-, GABP-, and Sp1-mediated Transcription—The induction of HSV IE gene transcription is dependent upon VP16, the virally encoded transactivator that is packaged in the virion and released into the cell upon infection (2Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1043-1107Google Scholar). It is also dependent upon multiple cellular transcription factors, such as Oct-1, Sp1, and GABP (Fig. 3A). The abrogation of IE gene expression in HCF-1-depleted cells suggested that this coactivator component was critical for mediating expression via the multiple transcription factors involved. This requirement was directly assessed using luciferase reporter constructs. HCF-1-depleted and control cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing the HSV ICP4 promoter-regulatory domain (-330 to +33, ICP4RD) and increasing amounts of a construct expressing the VP16 transactivator. VP16 induces the transcription of the viral IE genes via both the viral EC complex containing Oct-1, VP16, and HCF-1 and via the ets factor GABP. As shown in Fig. 3B, increasing amounts of VP16 increasingly stimulated the expression of the ICP4 regulatory domain-reporter in control cells (160-fold). However, this induction was compromised in HCF-1-depleted cells (50% reduction). It should be noted that the magnitude of the effect of HCF-1 depletion in this context was dependent upon the percent of cells expressing the reporter gene that had been initially depleted for HCF-1 (60%). Therefore, this reduction represents a near ablation of VP16-mediated stimulation in the depleted cells. As noted above, the induction of the viral genes is dependent upon multiple transcription factors and response elements. Therefore, the contribution of these individual elements and their dependence upon HCF-1 was assessed using reporter constructs containing a minimal promoter (TK -49 to +33) and EC, GABP, or Sp1 binding elements (Fig. 3C). In cells transfected with the control silencer construct, VP16 induced the expression of the EC (12-fold), GABP (4.5-fold), and GABP-EC (34-fold) element reporters. It was striking that in HCF-1-depleted cells, VP16 induction of these reporters was nearly completely abrogated (reduced by 90, 67, and 87%, respectively). It has been suggested previously that the nuclear import of VP is mediated by HCF-1 (37La Boissiere S. Hughes T. O'Hare P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remained possible that the HCF-1 dependence of the VP16 mediated induction of the IE genes reflected a failure of nuclear transport in HCF-1-depleted cells. However, in HCF-1-depleted cells, the induction mediated by both WT VP16 and VP16 containing a donor nuclear localization signal was both equally reduced. In addition, quantitative immunofluorescent assessment of VP16 and VP16-NLS localization demonstrated that these proteins were equally represented in the nucleus in both control and HCF-1-depleted cells ((average of nuclear mean fluorescence: control, 0.29; HCF-1-depleted, 0.30) (data not shown)). HCF-1 was required for VP16-mediated induction via the EC and GABP elements. The effect of HCF-1 depletion on the basal level expression mediated by each element as well as the specificity of this dependence for the HSV IE genes is shown in Fig. 3D. Increasing amounts of reporter constructs containing the ICP4RD, CMV IE enhancer-promoter, and the RSV LTR were transfected into control and HCF-1-depleted cells. As expected, the ICP4RD showed a significant reduction of basal level activity in HCF-1-depleted cells relative to the control cells. It is surprising, however, that the activity of the CMV IE and RSV LTR in HCF-1-depleted cells was nearly equivalent to that in control cells, indicating that depletion of HCF-1 did not result in a generalized transcriptional deficiency. Rather, HCF-1 was specifically required for the regulatory circuits that govern the expression of the HSV IE genes. The requirement for HCF-1 to mediate GABP and Sp1 determined basal level expression of the HSV IE genes was assessed by transfecting increasing amounts of the control minimal TATA promoter, GABP, EC, and Sp1 element reporters into control and HCF-1-depleted cells. HCF-1 depletion had no significant effect upon the expression of the control TATA promoter or upon the basal level expression of the EC element reporter (Fig. 3D). This is expected given that the EC element does not contribute to the expression of the HSV IE genes in the absence of VP16 (11Kristie T.M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4065-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, HCF-1 depletion had a dramatic effect upon the expression mediated by GABP (3-fold reduction) and Sp1 (10-fold reduction). The requirement for HCF-1 (specifically for the basal and induced levels of the HSV IE genes) indicates that the requirement must depend upon the dominant factors or upon the mechanism of cooperativity of the given transcription factors and their contribution to the combinatorial regulation. HSV and VZV: HCF-1 Mediation of a Herpesvirus IE Gene Expression—HCF-1 was clearly critical for the expression of the HSV IE genes but was dispensable for the activation of the CMV IE and RSV LTR. However, the second α herpesvirus, VZV, encodes a transactivator, ORF10, that is highly related to VP16 (31Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4693-4701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is similarly packaged in the VZV virion. In addition, the VZV IE62 regulatory domain consists of a number of transcription elements including enhancer core elements that mediate the assembly of an Oct-1/ORF10/HCF-1 complex (31Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4693-4701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). VZV differs from HSV, however, in that the IE62 protein also functions as an autostimulatory transcription factor (36Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Sadeghi-Zadeh M. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Virology. 1992; 191: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 38Baudoux L. Defechereux P. Schoonbroodt S. Merville M.P. Rentier B. Piette J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that is copackaged in the VZV virion (39Kinchington P.R. Hougland J.K. Arvin A.M. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 359-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the potential role of HCF-1 in the ORF10 and IE62 regulation of the VZV IE gene, reporter constructs containing the VZV EC element and the VZV IE62 responsive promoter were transfected into control and HCF-1-depleted cells in the presence or absence of ORF10 or IE62. As expected from the demonstrated assembly of Oct-1/ORF10/HCF-1 on the VZV EC element, HCF-1 was required to mediate ORF10 activation of the VZV EC reporter construct (Fig. 4B). However, HCF-1 was also required for VZV IE62 induction of both the base TATA promoter and the natural IE62 promoter (Fig. 4C). The specificity of this requirement was evident in the lack of HCF-1 effect upon the basal level expression of both constructs (Fig. 4D). The requirement for HCF-1 for both ORF10- and IE62-mediated expression of the VZV IE gene suggested that HCF-1 would be essential for VZV lytic replication. This was demonstrated by a significant reduction in VZV plaque size in HCF-1-depleted cells. Cultures of BSC cells were transfected with the control or HCF-1 silencer constructs and subsequently infected with 80 TCID VZV. Because HCF-1 is required for cell cycle progression (26Goto H. Motomura S. Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Nakabeppu Y. Fukushima K. Fujishima M. Herr W. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Julien E. Herr W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2360-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Julien E. Herr W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and because VZV replication may depend upon cell cycle, experimental conditions were adjusted to ensure that the cellular HCF-1 levels were depleted by only 50%. Under these conditions, cells continue to undergo mitosis at a normal rate (data not shown). At 6 days after infection, the cultures were stained, and the plaque numbers and sizes were quantitatively determined and compared with those in nontransfected control cells (Fig. 5). As shown, despite the depletion of only 50% of the endogenous cellular HCF-1, the average size of VZV plaques in these cultures were less than 15% of the average control plaque size. The results further emphasize that the coactivator HCF-1 functions as a critical common determinant for the expression of both HSV and VZV IE genes, even though these viral promoters are regulated via complex combinatorial transcription factor interactions. The results have significant implications for both the lytic replication cycles as well as the establishment and reactivation of these viruses from the latent state. The transcriptional regulation of the IE genes of HSV has been a model for combinatorial regulation by multiprotein assemblies. In vitro studies have defined the components and specificities involved in the protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions that govern the induced high-level transcription of these genes. Oct-1, GABP, and Sp1 have themselves been independently studied in various promoter and cellular contexts, whereas VP16 has been used extensively to investigate mechanisms of transcriptional activation. In the context of the IE gene regulatory-promoter domains, however, the significance and contribution of these components have not been defined in vivo. It was determined previously, using Oct-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, that Oct-1 is important but not essential for the induced transcription of the IE genes. Furthermore, the absence of Oct-1 did not affect the IE basal level expression (14Nogueira M.L. Wang V.E. Tantin D Sharp P.A. Kristie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The results indicated that alternative combinations of factors and mechanisms existed for expression and regulation of the IE genes, although Oct-1 was found to be essential for later stages of HSV lytic replication. In contrast, the depletion of HCF-1 significantly impacted the basal level IE expression mediated by GABP and Sp1 as well as the VP16-dependent transcriptional induction. In fact, the results in partially depleted transfected cell populations argue that HCF-1 is essential for IE expression and that this coactivator component regulates induction of these genes. These genes, therefore, provide an example of a second level of regulation in which the transcriptional coactivator is the critical component despite multiple transcription factors and potential regulatory circuits. It is interesting that although there is functional redundancy at the level of DNA binding transcription factor (i.e. Oct-1, Sp1, GABP), there does not seem to be such at the level of coactivator. In contrast, there seems to be a single dependent coactivator target for the modulation of this complex regulatory circuit. More strikingly, the specificity of this requirement is exemplified by the lack of HCF-1 contribution to the transcription promoted by the CMV IE and RSV LTR enhancer-promoters. Both of these contain binding sites for Sp1 and GABP but are unaffected by HCF-1 depletion. The contrast indicates that the coactivator dependence might be determined by factors other than the simple existence of transcription factor binding elements. It should also be considered that HCF-1 dependence or independence may ultimately be governed by the particular cell type milieu, the available or activated factors, or the arrangement and interactions of these components. Although the biochemical mechanisms that dictate the stringent HSV IE gene requirement for HCF-1 have not been elucidated, the protein does directly interact with each of the transcription factors that have been determined to cooperate at the IE gene regulatory domains. Interactions with VP16 in the assembly of the EC core and with the ancillary factors GABP and Sp1 might suggest that the protein is required to modulate the specific arrangement of a more complex critical regulatory assembly. On the other hand, HCF-1 may mediate interactions or activities that are required to circumvent common rate-limiting stages in the IE gene transcriptional activation, such as modulation of chromatin structure or mediation of required interactions with general factor components. Similar to the requirement for HCF-1 in the regulated expression of HSV IE genes, HCF-1 was also determined to be critical for the VZV ORF10- and IE62-mediated induction of the VZV IE62 promoter. The requirement for HCF-1 in ORF10 induction of the VZV IE62 gene is consistent with in vitro studies that previously demonstrated VZV enhancer core complex assembly with Oct-1/ORF10/HCF-1 (31Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4693-4701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, VZV IE expression is also positively autoregulated by IE62, presumably via increasing the affinity of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) for the nonconsensus IE62 TATA element (40Peng H. He H. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 41Perera L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 487-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Induction of the minimal VZV IE promoter by IE62 in an HCF-1-dependent manner suggests that HCF-1 may cooperatively facilitate this activity. On the other hand, IE62 may have multiple functions in transcriptional induction and the HCF-1 dependence reflects an alternate mechanism. Irrespective of the biochemical mechanisms involved in HCF-1-mediated transcription, it is clear that this component is essential for both HSV and VZV lytic replication cycles as defined by its requirement for viral IE gene expression. More significantly, the concerted regulation of the viral IE genes by HCF-1 has implications for the viral latency establishment and reactivation processes in sensory neurons. Although the details and molecular mechanisms involved in latency and reactivation remain unclear, it is likely that blocks to IE gene expression would promote the establishment of latency, whereas resumption of IE expression would be key to the reactivation process. It is noteworthy that HCF-1 is specifically sequestered in the cytoplasm of sensory neurons and is rapidly transported to the nucleus in response to stimuli that result in viral reactivation (32Kristie T.M. Vogel J.L. Sears A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The strict dependence of IE gene transcription upon this coactivator supports the model whereby the sequestering of HCF-1 would promote the establishment of latency. Furthermore, given that HCF-1 functions as an IE-specific coactivator for factors such as GABP and Sp1, the induced transport of HCF-1 to the nucleus could promote transcriptional activation of the HSV IE genes, leading to the initiation of viral reactivation in the absence of the transactivator VP16. In a similar manner, transport of HCF-1 could mediate the activation of VZV genes in concert with expressed VZV regulatory proteins during reactivation (42Lungu O. Panagiotidis C.A. Annunziato P.W.

Interleukin (IL)-12-mediated interferon (IFN)-γ production by activated T cells has been shown to be CsA-insensitive. In this report, we demonstrate that the IL-12-induced CsA-resistant pathway of IFN-γ production is sensitive to rapamycin. Rapamycin treatment resulted in the aberrant recruitment of Stat3, Stat4, and phospho-c-Jun to the genomic promoter region resulting in decreased IFN-γ transcription. IL-12-induced phosphorylation of Stat3 on Ser-727 was affected by rapamycin, which may be due to the effect of rapamycin on the IL-12-induced interaction between mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Stat3. In accordance with this, reduction in the mTOR protein level by small interfering RNA resulted in suppression of Stat3 phosphorylation and decreased production of IFN-γ after IL-12 stimulation. These results suggest that mTOR may play a major role in IL-12-induced IFN-γ production by activated T cells.

During an immune reaction in which antigen-presenting cells interact with T cells, both cell types get activated expressing both cell surface molecules and soluble factors that in turn are involved in further activating each cell type.

One of the cytokines produced by activated T cells is IFN-γ, which is a potent activator of antigen-presenting cells. Activated antigen-presenting cells produce IL-12 and IL-18, which are potent activators of T cells, which in turn produce IFN-γ. This circular pathway of mutual stimulation is important in eliciting a complete cell-mediated immune response. IL-12 is an important cytokine involved in the production of IFN-γ by T cells and NK cell, and plays an important role in the differentiation of T helper 1 (Th1) cell population (1Kubin M. Kamoun M.

A unique aspect of IL-12 signaling is that it works together with IL-18 and the T cell co-receptor CD28 in inducing IFN-γ production (1Kubin M. Kamoun M. Trinchieri G. J. Exp.

Although IL-12-induced IFN-γ expression has been shown to occur mostly at the level of transcription, the synergy between IL-12 and αCD28 or IL-12 and IL-2 has been shown to occur mostly at the post-transcriptional level, e.g. message stability and mobilization of nuclear mRNA (7Chan S.

IL-12 stimulation also induces serine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat4, which are important for their transcriptional activity (14Visconti R. Gadina M. Chiariello M. Chen E.H. Stancato L.F.

Recently, it has been shown that Stat4 binds to the IFN-γ promoter along with AP1 in response to IL-12 stimulation of activated T cells. This is the same promoter region where synergy between IL-12 and IL-18 occurs (17Barbulescu K. Becker C. Schlaak J.F. Meyer zum Schmitt E. Buschenfelde K.-H. Neurath M.F. J.

Depending on the type of external signals, T cells can initiate multiple intracellular signaling pathways that can be broadly classified into two groups: one that includes T cell receptors, CD3, and phorbol esters plus ionomycin and is sensitive to cyclosporin A (CsA) and the other that includes IL-12 alone or in combination with either IL-18 or αCD28 and is resistant to CsA (1Kubin M.

We have shown that the CD28-mediated CsA-resistant co-stimulatory pathway of T cell activation is sensitive to rapamycin (22Ghosh P. Buchholz M.A. Yano S. Taub D. Longo D.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 4517-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic with potent immunosuppressive properties. It is structurally related to the immunosuppressant FK506 and binds to the same intracellular receptor FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein) (23Bierer B.E. Mattila P.S. Standaert R.F. Herzenberg L.A.

However, the principal target proteins are different for these two compounds. Whereas FK506-FKBP12 inhibits the serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin, rapamycin-FKBP12 inhibits the serine-threonine kinase mTOR (24Crabtree G.R.

In this report, we investigated the effect of rapamycin on IL-12-induced IFN-γ production by activated human peripheral blood T cells. Our results show that IL-12-induced IFN-γ production was partially sensitive to rapamycin pretreatment. Rapamycin treatment resulted in the aberrant recruitment of Stat3, Stat4, and phospho-c-Jun to the genomic promoter region, resulting in decreased IFN-γ transcription. IL-12-induced phosphorylation of Stat3 on Ser-727 was affected by rapamycin, which might be responsible for the aberrant recruitment of transcription factors to the promoter region. Our data also show that the IL-12-induced interaction between mTOR and Stat3 was affected by rapamycin pretreatment, and the reduction in mTOR protein level by siRNA resulted in decreased production of IFN-γ after IL-12 stimulation. Thus, the present study illustrates a mechanism by which the IL-12-induced CsA-resistant signaling pathway can be manipulated by another immunosuppressive drug, rapamycin, providing another rationale for combination therapy approaches to diseases requiring T cell suppression.

Anti-Stat3 (sc-482), anti-Stat4 (sc-486) antiserum, and anti-phospho (Y705)-Stat3 mAb were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-mTOR antiserum was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), anti-nucleoporin (p62) was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), anti-phospho-(S727)-Stat3 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-phospho-(Y693)-Stat4 antiserum was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Cyclosporin A and rapamycin were purchased from Calbiochem. Cells and Tissue Cultures—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from healthy donors (who provided informed consent) were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Total resting T cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the human T cell enrichment column kit (R&D System). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. T cells were activated with plastic-bound anti-CD3 (200 ng/ml) plus anti-CD28 Ab (1 μg/ml) for 48 h. Preactivated T cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were then stimulated with 1 ng/ml recombinant IL-12 and/or 100 ng/ml anti-CD28 mAb clone 9.3 (kindly provided by Dr. Carl June, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA) for 1 h. Pretreatment with CsA and rapamycin was done 30 min before IL-12 stimulation. For measurement of IFN-γ production, T cells were stimulated for 20 h, and the supernatants were analyzed by a cytometric beads array kit (BD Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For differentiation of T cells into Th1 and Th2 populations, resting T cells were cultured as described previously (30Yano S. Ghosh P. Kusaba H. Buchholz M. Longo D.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2510-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT 3′ primer in a total volume of 20 μl. 2 μl of cDNA was amplified by PCR. The primers used were as follows: IFN-γ, 5′-AAGAGTGTGGAGACCATCAA-3′ and 5′-CTGACTCCTTTTTCGCTTCC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TGTCATACCAGGAAATGAGCTTGAC-3′ and 5′-CCTGGCCAAGGTCATCCATGACAAC-3′. The reaction volume of 25 μl contained each primer at 0.5 μm, dNTP at 200 μm, 2mm magnesium chloride, and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min; 38 cycles at 94 °C for 30s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30s; final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR was done with an iCycler (Bio-Rad). The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (31Uzzo R.G. Rayman P. Kolenko V. Clark P.E. Cathcart M.K. Bloom T. Novick A.C. Bukowski R.M. Hamilton T. Finke J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 100 μg of nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated according to the procedure described earlier (22Ghosh P. Buchholz M.A. Yano S. Taub D. Longo D.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 4517-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, protein A-Sepharose (10 μl 50% slurry) was first incubated with the antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The antibody-protein A-Sepharose was then washed and exposed to the lysates overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the immunocomplexes were eluted with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). The samples were boiled for 5 min, resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). Detection was carried out with ECL-Plus detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (32Kwon T.K. Buchholz M.A. Ponsalle P. Chrest F.J. Nordin A.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5642-5648PubMed Google Scholar). 300 μgof lysates were used to immunoprecipitate with 4 μg of anti-mTOR antibody. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) was used in this assay according to the procedure described earlier (30Yano S. Ghosh P. Kusaba H. Buchholz M. Longo D.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2510-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, T cells (1 × 106) were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 125 mm glycine for 5 min. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer. Chromatin was sheared by sonication and diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer. Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C overnight with 4 μl of anti-acetylhistone H4, 10 μlof anti-phospho-c-Jun (Upstate Biotechnology), 4 μg of anti-Stat3 (Santa Cruz), or 4 μg of anti-Stat4 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) rabbit polyclonal Ab. Immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 1 h. After washing, samples were eluted in elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) for the first ChIP or in 10 mm dithiothreitol for the second ChIP (33Lerner L. Henriksen M.A. Zhang X. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Samples for second ChIP were diluted in ChIP dilution buffer and reimmunoprecipitated with a second antibody. Immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose, washed, and eluted in elution buffer. DNA cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. After proteinase K digestion, DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated in ethanol. 1/20th of the total volume of DNA was used in each PCR using the following primer pairs: sense, 5′-TGCCTCAAAGAATCCCACC-3′ (nucleotides 105–123), and antisense, 5′-CAGTAACAGCCAAGAGAACC-3′ (nucleotides 542–523). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min; 38 cycles at 94 °C for 30s, 58 °C for 30s and 72 °C for 30s; final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Treatment of Peripheral Blood T Cells with mTOR-specific siRNA— Human peripheral blood T cells were transfected with mTOR-specific siRNA using human T cell Nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, CD3/CD28-preactivated T cells (5 × 106/point) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then transfected with 1.4 μg of either control siRNA or siRNA specific for mTOR (Dharmacon, Inc.). After transfection, cells were cultured for 48 h, washed, and then stimulated with 1 ng/ml rIL-12 for either 1 h to prepare lysates or 24 h to collect supernatants for IFN-γ measurement. Effect of Rapamycin on IL-12-mediated IFN-γ Production by T Cells—It has been reported that IL-12-mediated IFN-γ production by T cells is insensitive to CsA and that IL-12 synergizes with IL-18- or CD28-mediated costimulation in a CsA-resistant manner (1Kubin M. Kamoun M. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 19Yang J. Murphy T.L. Ouyang W. Murphy K.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Yoshimoto T. Takeda K. Tanaka T. Ohkusu K. Kashiwamura S-I. Okamura H. Akira S. Nakanishi K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3400-3407PubMed Google Scholar). Because the CsA-resistant pathway has been thought to be responsible for the limited effectiveness of CsA in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (21Pai S.Y. Fruman D.A. Leong T. Neuberg D. Rosano T.G. McGarigle C. Antin J.H. Bierer B.E. Blood. 1994; 84: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to investigate the effect of rapamycin on IL-12-mediated IFN-γ production. To determine the effect of rapamycin on IL-12-induced IFN-γ production, we used freshly isolated human peripheral blood T cells that have been activated by αCD3 plus αCD28 for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1a, IL-12 stimulation of preactivated T cells produced a significant amount of IFN-γ, which was insensitive to pretreatment of CsA but was partially inhibited by rapamycin pretreatment. The levels of IFN-γ production were further increased significantly when cells were treated with IL-12 in the presence of αCD28 antibody, where αCD28 treatment alone had no effect (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, IL-12 plus αCD28-mediated IFN-γ production was also sensitive to rapamycin pretreatment, whereas CsA had no effect on IFN-γ production. The insensitivity of the IL-12 or IL-12 plus αCD28 treatment to CsA was not due to the ineffective dose of CsA (100 ng/ml), since the escalation of the dose up to 500 ng/ml had no effect on these treatments (Fig. 1b). The maximum inhibitory effect of rapamycin was found to be 20 ng/ml (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, even with the highest dose, the maximum inhibition by rapamycin was 60%, indicating the involvement of a rapamycin-resistant pathway. These data suggested that IL-12-mediated IFN-γ production by activated T cells was insensitive to CsA but was partially sensitive to rapamycin. Interestingly, the incremental increase in IL-12-induced IFN-γ production mediated by CD28 costimulation was almost completely inhibited by rapamycin. Effect of Rapamycin on IL-12-induced Transcription of IFN-γ Gene—To determine whether the effect of rapamycin on IL-12-mediated IFN-γ production was due to the decreased IFN-γ transcription, total RNAs were isolated from activated T cells treated under different conditions as shown in Fig. 2. Total RNAs were then used to measure the expression levels of IFN-γ gene by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Like the protein level, the expression level of IFN-γ mRNA was increased upon IL-12 treatment, and the IFN-γ mRNA level was unaffected by CsA pretreatment but was reduced by rapamycin pretreatment. IL-12 plus αCD28 treatment caused a slight increase in expression levels of IFN-γ mRNA over IL-12 treatment alone, whereas αCD28 treatment alone had no effect. However, the addition of αCD28 had a greater effect on cytokine production than on message levels. Again, IL-12 plus αCD28-treated expression of IFN-γ mRNA was partially sensitive to rapamycin but insensitive to CsA. These data suggested two things. First, IL-12-induced IFN-γ production by activated T cells occurred mainly at the level of transcription, as has been reported earlier (7Chan S. Kobayashi M. Santoli D. Perussia B. Trinchieri G. J.

In agreement with this, the synergy between αCD28 and IL-12 has been shown to occur at the level of message stability (8Walker W. Aste-Amezaga M. Kastelein R.A. Trinchieri G. Hunter C.A. J.

Hamaoka T. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Fujiwara H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because we found that IL-12-induced IFN-γ transcription was partially sensitive to rapamycin, we wanted to determine whether rapamycin pretreatment had any effect on the IL-12-induced recruitment of the Stat4/AP1 complex to the IFN-γ promoter. For this purpose, we performed a ChIP assay. Besides Stat4 and phospho-c-Jun, we also examined the status of Stat3 and acetylated histone H4. It has been shown that IL-12 stimulation also activates Stat3 (10O'Shea J.J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and acetylated histone H4 was chosen to monitor the activation status of the chromatin, since acetylation of histone H4 has been correlated to the transcriptionally active chromatin (34Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3a, Stat4 was recruited to the promoter after IL-12 stimulation (lanes 2 versus 1), and that level of recruitment was slightly increased after IL-12/αCD28 treatment (lanes 6 versus 2). Pretreatment with CsA did not affect either IL-12- or IL-12/αCD28-induced recruitment of Stat4 (lanes 3 versus 2, and lanes 7 versus 6), but the recruitments were reduced by rapamycin in both IL-12 and IL-12/αCD28 stimulations (lanes 4 versus 2 and lanes 8 versus 6). The recruitments of Stat3 and phospho-c-Jun were similar to the Stat4 recruitment except for the fact that the level of Stat3 after IL-12 stimulation alone was not significantly higher than the control level present due to the preactivation of T cells. Input controls demonstrated that equivalent amounts of materials were added to each immunoprecipitation. The degree of acetylation of histone H4 was comparable among different treatments, indicating the transcriptionally active nature of the IFN-γ promoter. In lanes 9–11 the recruitment status of the individual transcription factor was examined as a function of T cell subset. The results showed that Stat3, Stat4, and phosphoc-Jun were recruited to Th1 cells but not precursor or Th2 cells. We and others have shown recently that during in vitro differentiation of human peripheral blood T cells to Th1 or Th2, the degree of acetylation of histone H4 was greater in Th1 compared with Th2, indicating that the IFN-γ promoter was more active transcriptionally in Th1 than in pTh and Th2 cells (30Yano S. Ghosh P. Kusaba H. Buchholz M. Longo D.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2510-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 35Fields P.E. Kim S.T. Flavell R.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Our next step was to identify whether Stat3 and Stat4 were recruited simultaneously to IFN-γ promoter upon IL-12 stimulation. For that purpose we performed sequential ChIP analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” First immunoprecipitation was done with either anti-Stat3 or anti-Stat4 (designated as first ChIP), and the immunoprecipitated sample was subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with either normal IgG, anti-Stat4, or anti-Stat3 (designated as second ChIP). As shown in Fig. 3b, the immunoprecipitated complexes after the first ChIP with either anti-Stat3 or anti-Stat4 showed the presence of Stat4 or Stat3, respectively, in the DNA-protein complex as demonstrated by the PCR amplification of the promoter region. The products obtained from the second ChIP were specific since no PCR product was obtained from the second ChIP performed with normal IgG. These results demonstrated that the recruitment of Stat3 and Stat4 to the IFN-γ promoter was simultaneous upon IL-12 stimulation, and these inducible recruitments were insensitive to CsA but were sensitive to rapamycin pretreatment (Fig. 3b). Without additional experiments, we cannot conclude from these ChIP assays if Stat3 and Stat4 were recruited to the IFN-γ promoter as a complex. Rapamycin Affects IL-12-induced Phosphorylation of Stat3 on Ser-727—To determine the mechanism underlying the effect of rapamycin on IL-12 signaling, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis of the nuclear lysates prepared from activated T cells treated with different stimuli as shown in Fig. 4a. The results demonstrated that IL-12 stimulation induced interaction between Stat3 and Stat4 that was unaffected by treatment with either CsA or rapamycin. The Stat4-associated Stat3 was both tyrosine (position 705)- and serine (position 727)-phosphorylated, whereas Stat4 was tyrosine-phosphorylated at position 609. Interestingly, rapamycin, but not CsA pretreatment, only decreased IL-12-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat3 at position 727 without affecting tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat4. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis using nuclear extracts of activated T cells treated with various stimuli. As shown in Fig. 4b, only rapamycin, but not CsA pretreatment, inhibited IL-12-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat3 at position 727, but this pretreatment did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of either Stat3 or Stat4. The decrease in serine phosphorylation was not due to a decreased level of nuclear Stat3, as revealed by the presence of comparable levels of Stat3 present in different treatments. To rule out the possibility that the anti-phospho-Stat3 (Ser-727) antiserum did not cross-react with the serine-phosphorylated Stat4, we performed immunoprecipitation analysis with either anti-Stat3 or anti-Stat4 antiserum using IL-12-stimulated nuclear lysate, which was boiled in 1% SDS to disrupt the protein-protein interaction. As shown in Fig. 4c, the phospho-Stat3 was detected only in the sample that had been immunoprecipitated with anti-Stat3 but not with anti-Stat4 (upper panel). The cross-reactive band, designated by the asterisk in the upper panel, was a nonspecific band since it was not competed by the cognate peptide (data not shown). In the lower panel, more Stat4 was detected in Stat4-immunoprecipitated, but not in Stat3-immunoprecipitated sample. These results indicated the lack of cross-reactivity between anti-phospho-Stat3 (Ser-727) antiserum and phosphorylated Stat4. Collectively, these data suggest that the effect of rapamycin on IL-12-induced IFN-γ production might be due to the decreased serine phosphorylation of Stat3 at position 727, although we cannot rule out the role of serine phosphorylation of Stat4 and c-Jun. Role of mTOR in IL-12-induced IFN-γ Production by Activated T cells—Because IL-12-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat3 was inhibited by rapamycin, we tested whether mTOR interacted directly with Stat3. Whole cell lysates of activated T cells treated with either medium alone or IL-12 in the presence or absence of rapamycin pretreatment were used for co-immunoprecipitation analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, IL-12 treatment caused inducible interaction between mTOR and Stat3, which was decreased by pretreatment with rapamycin. We were unable to detect any association between mTOR and Stat4 (data not shown). To further confirm the role of mTOR in IL-12-induced IFN-γ production, T cells were transfected with either control siRNA or siRNA specific for mTOR. Transfected cells were then treated with either medium alone or rIL-12. As shown in Fig. 6a, the treatment with mTOR-specific siRNA resulted in decreased production of IFN-γ upon IL-12 stimulation as compared with control siRNA-treated cells, and this effect was due to the decrease in mTOR protein levels by mTOR-specific siRNA (Fig. 6b). To determine the effect of mTOR level on IL-12-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat3, cell lysates from mTOR-specific siRNA-treated cells were analyzed for phsopho-Stat3. As shown in Fig. 6c, a decrease in mTOR level also resulted in the decrease in serine 727 phosphorylation of Stat3. This decrease in serine phosphorylation was not due to the decrease in total Stat3 level, since total Stat3 was comparable between the IL-12-treated samples. These data demonstrated that mTOR might be directly involved in IL-12-induced IFN-γ production by activated T cells.Fig. 6Decrease in mTOR protein level affected IL-12-induced IFN-γ production. CD3/CD28-preactivated T cells were transfected with either control siRNA (Control) or mTOR-specific siRNA (siRNA). Transfected cells were restimulated with either medium alone or 1 ng/ml of rIL-12 for either 1 h (panel b, for lysate preparation) or 24 h (panel a, for IFN-γ measurement). c, effect of mTOR siRNA on phosphorylation of Stat3 (Ser-727). Preactivated T cells were transfected with either control siRNA or mTOR specific siRNA as above, and the lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-mTOR, anti-phospho-Stat3 (Ser-727), and anti-Stat3. This is a representative experiment of three independent donors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this report we described the sensitivity of the CsA resistant IL-12-signaling pathway to rapamycin. Our data demonstrated that the production of IFN-γ after stimulation with either IL-12 alone or in combination with αCD28 was partially sensitive to rapamycin. The degree of suppression of IFN-γ production remained the same with higher doses of rapamycin, indicating the possible presence of a rapamycin-resistant pathway. Our data show that the IL-12-induced increase in the steady state level of IFN-γ mRNA was insensitive to CsA while being partially sensitive to pretreatment with rapamycin. These data suggest that IL-12-induced IFN-γ gene transcription might be affected by rapamycin. It has been shown that Stat4 binds to the IFN-γ promoter along with AP1 in response to IL-12 stimulation of activated T cells. This is the same promoter region where synergy between IL-12 and IL-18 occurs (17Barbulescu K. Becker C. Schlaak J.F. Meyer zum Schmitt E. Buschenfelde K.-H. Neurath M.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3642-3647PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nakahira M. Ahn H-J. Park W.-R. Gao P. Tomura M. Park C.-S. Hamaoka T. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Fujiwara H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of this promoter region in IL-12-induced IFN-γ gene expression, we performed a ChIP assay to monitor the promoter recruitments of Stat4, Stat3, and phospho-c-Jun (Fig. 3a). The results demonstrated that IL-12 stimulation induced the recruitment of Stat4, Stat3, and phospho-c-Jun to the promoter and that these recruitments were sensitive to rapamycin but not to CsA. Next, we wanted to know whether Stat4 and Stat3 were recruited to the same promoter simultaneously, since it was possible that the cells, which showed Stat4 recruitments, were different from the cells that had Stat3 recruitment. Sequential ChIP analysis revealed that the IL-12 treatment induced simultaneous recruitments of Stat4 and Stat3 to the same promoter (Fig. 3b). Although it has been shown that Stat4 forms a heterodimer with Stat3 and this heterodimer binds to DNA upon IL-12 stimulation (Ref. 11Jacobson N.G. Szabo S.J. Weber-Nordt R.M. Zhong Z. Schreiber R.D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Murphy K.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar and Fig. 4), without additional experiments we cannot conclude from these ChIP assays if Stat4 and Stat3 were recruited to the IFN-γ promoter as a complex. To identify the mechanism behind the IL-12-induced aberrant recruitments of Stat4 and Stat3 to the IFN-γ promoter upon rapamycin pretreatment, we tested the effect of rapamycin on the IL-12-induced heterodimer formation between Stat3 and Stat4. Interestingly, the degree of interaction between Stat3 and Stat4 upon IL-12 stimulation was unaffected by rapamycin pretreatment, although that same pretreatment caused a decrease in the serine phosphorylation of Stat3 associated with Stat4. We also confirmed this effect of rapamycin by Western blot analysis. Although IL-12-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat4 was unaffected by rapamycin, IL-12-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat3 was decreased by rapamycin. This is in agreement with the published reports where Stat3 has been shown to be a substrate of mTOR (36Yokogami K. Wakisaka S. Avruch J. Reeves S.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 47-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We were unable to determine the serine phosphorylation status of Stat4 due to the unavailability of phospho-Stat4-specific antiserum. These data suggested two things; first, serine phosphorylation of Stat3 had no influence on the IL-12-induced dimer formation with Stat4, and second, Stat3 could be a direct substrate of mTOR, as has been reported earlier (36Yokogami K. Wakisaka S. Avruch J. Reeves S.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 47-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 37Rajan P. Panchision D.M. Newell L.F. McKay R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To investigate the latter possibility, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis with mTOR (Fig. 5). The results demonstrated that mTOR interacted with Stat3 in an IL-12stimulation-dependent manner and that the inducible interaction was inhibited by rapamycin. Whether mTOR directly phosphorylates Stat3 upon IL-12 stimulation needs to be determined. To further investigate the role of mTOR in IL-12 signaling, we used mTOR-specific siRNA. The resulting lowered mTOR protein levels produced decreases in both Stat3 serine phosphorylation and IFN-γ production after IL-12 stimulation. Our data suggest that the serine phosphorylation of Stat3 is an important event in the IL-12-induced IFN-γ production by activated peripheral blood T cells. The phosphorylation at serine 727 of Stat3 seems critical in the recruitments of Stat3, Stat4, and phospho-c-Jun to the IFN-γ promoter, although it has been reported that the serine phosphorylation of Stat3 at 727 has no influence on its DNA binding (38Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2062-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, there are several factors that can contribute to this discrepancy. The gel shift analysis that was used to support the previous conclusion has less physiological relevance than we show in our ChIP assay. Our studies use the IL-12-responsive region of the IFN-γ promoter which is a composite element consisting of Stats and AP1 binding sites, thus being more specific than the Stat consensus binding sequence used in the previous study. Last, the effect of rapamycin on IL-12 induced recruitments of transcription factors to the IFN-γ promoter could be due to the decreased serine phosphorylations of Stat4 and/or c-Jun in addition to the Stat3 serine phosphorylation. This phosphorylation status of Stat4 and c-Jun is currently under investigation.

The mevalonate and methylerythritol phosphate pathways are responsible for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, a diverse group of organic natural products found in animals, plants, fungi, insects, and bacteria. Isoprenoids are further divided into classes of primary and secondary metabolites. Isoprenoids that are primary metabolites include sterols, carotenoids, hormones, and long chain hydrocarbons used to tether particular enzymes to membrane systems, compounds essential for viability. Isoprenoids classified as secondary metabolites include monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and triterpenes, and many of these mediate interactions between organisms and their environments (1Stevens K.L.

Plant J. 1999; 19: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Menting J. Scopes R.K. Stevenson T.W. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) catalyzes the planar insertion of hydroxyl groups into the equivalent meta-positions (C-3′ and C-5′) of the flavonoid B (phenolic) ring and yields 3′-, 5′-, and 3′,5′-hydroxylated reaction products (29Menting J. Scopes R.K. Stevenson T.W. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ent-Kaurene oxidase (32Helliwell C.A. Poole A. Peacock W.J. Dennis E.S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) catalyzes the successive oxidation of the methyl substituent of ent-kaurene at C-19 en route to ent-kaurenoic acid. ent-Kaurenoic acid is itself subject to multiple oxidations and a ring contraction through the action of a single P450, CYP88A, or ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (33Helliwell C.A. Chandler P.M. Poole A. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2065-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase and both ent-kaurene and ent-kaurenoic acid oxidases catalyze regiospecific hydroxylations, these enzymes do not exhibit the regio- and stereospecific complexity of EAH. EAH introduces hydroxyl groups at distal sites on opposite faces of the epiaristolochene ring system (see Scheme 1).A preferred order for the successive hydroxylation of EA has yet to be determined (see Scheme 1). Of the two possible monohydroxylated intermediates of EA, only 3α-hydroxy-EA (3α(OH)EA) has been reported as a minor metabolite accumulating in pepper fruits challenged with fungal spores (34Watson D.G. Baker F.C. Brooks C.J.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1983; 11: 589-590Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting that small amounts of this reaction intermediate might be released as a general consequence of catalysis. Consistent with this notion are several observations that 3α(OH)EA can be converted to capsidiol. Whitehead et al. (35Whitehead I.M. Threlfall D.R. Ewing D.F. Phytochemistry. 1989; 28: 775-779Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported a modest conversion of 3α(OH)EA to capsidiol when radiolabeled forms of this intermediate were fed to either control or elicitor-treated callus cultures of tobacco. However, although Ralston et al. (14Ralston L. Kwon S.T. Schoenbeck M. Ralston J. Schenk D.J. Coates R.M. Chappell J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) documented the ready conversion of 3α(OH)EA to capsidiol by microsomes from yeast overexpressing the EAH gene, they also reported the biosynthesis of capsidiol without the accumulation of either monohydroxylated intermediate, 3α(OH)EA or 1β(OH)EA, in reactions incubated with low concentrations (<1 μm) of the EA substrate. Although 1β(OH)EA has not been reported as a reaction product of EAH or observed in plants exposed to exogenous stimuli, preference for P450-mediated hydroxylations of mono- and diterpenes occurring allylic to carbon–carbon double bonds (16Wüst M. Little D.B. Schalk M. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Schoendorf A. Rithner C.D. Williams R.M. Croteau R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 2001; 98: 13595-13600Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) suggests that the initial hydroxylation catalyzed by EAH could occur at C-1, followed by that at C-3.This work describes investigations of the successive regio- and stereospecific hydroxylation of EA by EAH. The ready availability of EA, 3α(OH)EA, and 1β(OH)EA greatly facilitated our ability to perform detailed kinetic studies to address the preferred order of hydroxylation. Sequence comparisons with related P450 enzymes and modeling of EAH based upon the mammalian 2C5 steroid hydroxylase structure (36Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) enabled us to identify amino acid residues potentially providing catalytic specificity to these reactions. These structural hypotheses were then tested by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis. Together, the results demonstrate a preferred reaction order and provide evidence that Ser368 and Ile486 play a significant role in orchestrating the successive hydroxylation of EA to capsidiol.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Standard laboratory reagents were purchased from Fisher, Sigma, and Aldrich. Authentic standards of EA, 3α(OH)EA, and capsidiol were available from previous work (14Ralston L. Kwon S.T. Schoenbeck M. Ralston J. Schenk D.J. Coates R.M. Chappell J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Synthesis of 1β(OH)EA, 3β(OH)EA, EA-1-one, and EA-3-one was conducted as described (37Zhao Y. Schenk D.J. Takahashi S. Chappell J. Coates R.M. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—All mutations were engineered into the CYP71D20 (EAH) cDNA using the standard QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) (38Rising K.A. Starks C.M. Noel J.P. Chappell J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1861-1866Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A full-length EAH cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF368376) inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites of the pBluescript II KS(+) vector was used in combination with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primer pairs (with the mutation sites underlined): S368A primers, 5′-GACTTCATCCACCGGCTCCACTTTTGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGACCAAAAGTGGAGCCGGTGGATGAAGTC-3′; S368C primers, 5′-GACTTCATCCACCGTGTCCACTTTTGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGACCAAAAGTGGACACGGTGGATGAAGTC-3′; S368T primers, 5′-GACTTCATCCACCGACTCCACTTTTGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGACCAAAAGTGGAGTCGGTGGATGAAGTC-3′; S368V primers, 5′-GACTTCATCCACCGGTTCCACTTTTGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGACCAAAAGTGGAACCGGTGGATGAAGTC-3′; S368I primers, 5′-GACTTCATCCACCGATTCCACTTTTGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGACCAAAAGTGGAATCGGTGGATGAAGTC-3′; S368F primers, 5′-GACTTCATCCACCGTTTCCACTTTTGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGACCAAAAGTGGAAACGGTGGATGAAGTC-3′; I486A primers, 5′-CGAATTATCGGGAATAACTGCTGCTAGAAAGGGTGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCACCCTTTCTAGCAGCAGTTATTCCCGATAATTCG-3′. Site-specific mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing performed using the Big-Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing protocol of PerkinElmer Life Sciences in combination with an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Mutated cDNAs were subsequently subcloned from the pBluescript vector into the corresponding BamHI/EcoRI sites of pYeDP60, a standard yeast expression vector providing galactose inducibility for expression of the inserted cDNA (39Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Yeast Expression and Microsome Preparations—Expression vectors harboring wild-type or mutant EAH were introduced into the WAT11 yeast strain, a strain previously engineered with an Arabidopsis NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase gene (40Urban P. Mignotte C. Kazmaier M. Delorme F. Pompon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19176-19186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. P. Urban (Centre de Génétique Moléculaire, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Transformants were grown from single colonies; expression of the EAH cDNAs was induced by galactose addition to the growth medium; and microsomes were prepared as described previously (41Greenhagen B.T. Griggs P. Takahashi S. Ralston L. Chappell J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).CO Difference Spectra—CO difference spectra were determined to estimate the amount of properly folded wild-type and mutant EAH proteins in microsome preparations. The amount of functional P450 was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 91 mm-1 cm-1 at 450 nm (42Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant enzymes showed a clear absorption maximum at 450 nm (Supplemental Fig. 1), consistent with properly folded enzymes having the heme cofactor oriented in the correct electron spin state.EAH Assays—Standard assays were performed in 1-ml glass vials with a final reaction volume of 200 μl containing 4% Me2SO, 2.4 mm NADPH, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and microsomes at a final concentration of 90 or 180 pmol of EAH protein eq (determined by CO difference spectroscopy)/ml. Substrate concentrations were varied from 2 to 100 μm for EA, 3 to 30 μm for 3α(OH)EA, and 0.5 to 30 μm for 1β(OH)EA. After preincubation of the reaction mixtures at 30 °C for 5 min, the reactions were initiated by the addition of 2.4 mm NADPH and allowed to proceed for 2 min (EA), 1 min (1β(OH)EA), or 5 min (3α(OH)EA), which allowed for 5–20% conversion of substrate to reaction product(s). The reactions were terminated by the rapid addition of 400 μl of ethyl acetate and mixed by vortexing, followed by removal of the ethyl acetate extract. A second ethyl acetate extract was combined with the first, and the combined organic extracts were carefully concentrated on ice under N2 gas, redissolved in 20 μl of ethyl acetate containing 10 ng/μl valencene as an internal standard, and subjected to gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. Assays were performed in triplicate for each substrate concentration, and kinetic constants were calculated by a nonlinear regression fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using EnzymeKinetics Version 1.5 software (Trinity Software). Kinetic constants calculated from Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee, and Hanes-Woolf plots were not significantly different from those derived from nonlinear regression. Optimized reactions were linear with respect to reaction product generation over time and corresponded to a 5–20% conversion of substrate to product, sufficient to generate 1 ng or more of reaction product(s) readily quantified and identifiable by GC/MS.Reaction Product Analyses—Quantification of the reaction products as well as standards of EA, 1β(OH)EA, 3α(OH)EA, and capsidiol was routinely performed using (+)-valencene (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) as an internal standard. Accuracy of the valencene standard was periodically verified relative to a (-)-α-cedrene standard (Fluka). Reaction products (1-μl aliquots) were quantified with an HP-5890 gas chromatograph equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-μm phase thickness) and a flame ionization detector as described previously (38Rising K.A. Starks C.M. Noel J.P. Chappell J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1861-1866Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Splitless injections were performed at an injection port temperature of 250 °C with an initial column temperature of 140 °C maintained for 0.5 min. The column temperature was then increased to 230 °C with a 4 °C/min gradient. In addition to comigration and retention time comparisons with authentic standards, reaction products were identified by MS using a Thermo Finnigan DSQ GC/MS system equipped with a Restec Rtx-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, 0.25-μm phase thickness). Samples were injected in the splitless mode at 250 °C with an initial oven temperature of 70 °C for 1 min, followed by an 8 °C/min gradient to 230 °C. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV, scanning from 35 to 300 atomic mass units, and compared with authentic standards for verification.Purification of the EAH-S368V Reaction Products—To isolate and identify the EAH-S368V reaction products, ethyl acetate extracts from the in vitro assays were carefully concentrated under an N2 stream and resuspended with hexane such that the final ethyl acetate concentration was <2%. The sample was then applied to a 230–400 mesh silica column (0.5 × 1 cm), and the hydrocarbon fraction was collected with a 2-ml hexane wash. Hydroxylated products were selectively eluted with 2 ml of a 1:19 (v/v) ethyl acetate/hexane solution, followed by 2 ml of a 1:4 (v/v) ethyl acetate/hexane solution. The fractions were carefully reconcentrated under an N2 stream before GC/MS analysis.Computational Studies—Homology modeling was performed with Modeler Version 6.2 (43Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.

Ligands EA, 1β(OH)EA, and 3α(OH)EA were created using Chemdraw Ultra Version 7.0.1, energy-minimized with MOPAC in Chem3D Ultra Version 7.0 (CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge, MA), and subsequently used in docking simulation experiments. Docking calculations were conducted with GOLD Version 1.2 software (Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking, Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom) (46Jones G. Willett P.

Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar).RESULTSOptimization of the EAH Activity—Numerous preliminary experiments were performed to optimize EAH activity for the conversion of EA to capsidiol. For example, the ability of a miscible organic co-solvent and various detergents to improve EA solubility was assessed. Maximum conversion of EA to capsidiol activity was observed at final concentrations of 2–5% (v/v) Me2SO, but was inhibited at concentrations >10%. Detergents were also evaluated at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.1%. Triton X-100 (v/v), deoxycholate (w/v), and 1-O-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (w/v) all inhibited EAH activity, whereas CHAPS (w/v) and Tween 20 (v/v) had no effect. Standard assays were therefore performed using EA stock solutions dissolved in Me2SO and assayed at a final Me2SO concentration of 4% (v/v) in all reaction assays. The pH optimum was determined using 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2–9.2) and phosphate (pH 6.0–7.5) buffering systems. Maximum activity was observed at pH 7.5 with little preference for either the Tris-HCl or phosphate buffer. The optimum NADPH concentration for EAH activity was also determined. The maximum conversion rate for EA to capsidiol was observed at 0.3 mm and remained saturated up to a final concentration of 2.4 mm. The Km for NADPH was subsequently estimated to be 61 ± 5 μm. All subsequent enzyme assays were therefore performed at optimized reaction conditions of 4% (v/v) Me2SO and 2.4 mm NADPH in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).Kinetic Analysis of EAH Indicate"
https://openalex.org/W2051321998,"The substituted cysteine accessibility method has proven useful for investigating structural changes of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor during channel gating and allosteric modulation. In the present study, the surface accessibility and reaction rate of propyl- and hexyl-methanethiosulfonate to cysteine residues introduced into the third transmembrane segment of the GABAA receptor α1 subunit were examined. GABA-induced currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing wild type and cysteine mutant GABAA receptors were recorded before and after application of methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents in the resting, GABA- or alcohol-bound (ethanol or hexanol) states. Our results indicate that a water-filled cavity exists around the Ala291 and Tyr294 residues of the third transmembrane segment, in agreement with previous results. Furthermore, our data indicate that a conformational change produced by alcohols (200 mm ethanol or 0.5 mm hexanol) exposure induces the water cavity around the A291C and Y294C residues to extend deeper, causing the A295C and F296C residues to become accessible to the MTS reagents. In addition, exposure of the A291C, Y294C, F296C, and V297C mutants to MTS reagents in the presence of GABA had significant effects on their GABA-induced currents, indicating that the water cavity around A291C and Y294C residues expanded to F296C and V297C by a structural movement caused by GABA binding.

If the substituted cysteine reacts with the reagent to cause the function of the channel to be irreversibly changed, the cysteine is assumed to be exposed at the water-accessible protein surface (15Williams D.B.

This indicates that structural movement by GABA, diazepam, or propofol binding might allow sulfhydryl-specific reagents to penetrate into the interior of the TM domain (15Williams D.B. Akabas M.H.

A binding cavity for alcohols may exist in a crevice near the extracellular ends of the TM2 or TM3 regions of GABAA and glycine receptors (7Wick M.J. Mihic S.J. Ueno S. Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R.

In the present study, we asked how the structure of the alcohol-bound GABAA receptor differs from the resting or GABA-bound states.We used the SCAM to investigate the structure and conformational changes of the TM3 region of GABAA receptor α1 subunit during channel gating and alcohol modulation. We propose that a water-filled cavity exists around the extracellular side of TM3 and that the cavity deepens to the middle region of TM3 during channel gating and alcohol binding. Furthermore, based on results of functional accessibility of PMTS and HMTS, our data suggest that the extracellular side of TM3 is more flexible or dynamic compared with cytosolic side of TM3. Thus, structural rearrangement of the existing water-filled cavities around the extracellular side of TM3 during channel gating and alcohol binding may have an important role in both forming the binding sites for alcohols and in the mechanism of allosteric modulation of the GABAA receptor by alcohols.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis and Expression—pGEMHE plasmids encoding wild type and 16 cysteine mutants from Ala291 to Val307 in TM3 of the rat GABAA α1 subunit were described previously (15Williams D.B. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2563-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). cRNAs were synthesized from pCIS2 plasmid encoding human β2 GABAA receptor subunit and pGEMHE plasmids encoding rat α1 or γ2s GABAA receptor subunits by using a T7 RNA polymerase kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated and injected with the cRNAs (10 ng/50 nl) encoding wild type or mutant α1, wild type β2, and γ2s subunits combinations in a 1:1:1 ratio of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water (15Williams D.B. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2563-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We introduced one additional mutation (I290C) using site-directed mutagenesis in pGEMHE plasmid encoding the rat GABA receptor α1 subunit and a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). This mutation was verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing.Electrophysiological Analysis—GABA-induced currents were recorded from oocytes 2–5 days after cRNA injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp (23Mascia M.P. Gong D.H. Eger II, E.I. Harris R.A. Anesth. Analg. 2000; 91: 1289-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The oocytes were perfused at 1.8 ml/min with modified Barth's solution (MBS; 88 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 10 mg/liter streptomycin, 10,000 units/liter penicillin, 50 mg/liter gentamicin, 90 mg/liter theophylline, and 220 mg/liter pyruvate, pH 7.5). GABA in MBS was applied for 20–25 s. The holding potential was -70 mV.GABA, ethanol, and hexanol were obtained from Sigma. MTS reagents (PMTS and HMTS) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Canada). Solutions of GABA, ethanol, or hexanol were prepared in MBS. Stock solutions of PMTS and HMTS were first prepared in Me2SO and then diluted in MBS to a final Me2SO concentration not exceeding 0.05%. The solutions of alcohols or MTS reagents were freshly prepared immediately before use.To investigate the surface accessibility of MTS reagents to GABAA receptors, GABA control currents were first determined by using two different GABA concentrations corresponding to the EC5–10 and EC50 values. These currents were determined to be stable after change of <5% in the GABA-induced currents on more than two consecutive applications. The EC5–10 or EC50 are concentrations of agonist that evoke 5–10 or 50% of the maximal current (obtained by application of 1 mm GABA). Second, oocytes expressing wild type or mutant GABAA receptors were perfused 90 s with PMTS or HMTS solutions in the resting state (0.5 mm MTS alone), GABA-bound state (0.5 mm MTS reagents in 1 mm GABA), or alcohol-bound state (0.5 mm MTS reagents in 200 mm ethanol or 0.5 mm hexanol). Following washing (10–15 min) with MBS, the GABA control currents (EC5–10 and EC50) were redetermined. The effect of MTS reagents was calculated as follows: The percentage of change = {(Iafter/Ibefore) - 1} × 100, where Ibefore and Iafter indicate the values of the two control currents induced by EC5–10 or EC50 GABA concentrations before and after the application of the MTS reagent.To determine the percentage of potentiation on GABA (EC5–10) response by alcohols (200 mm ethanol or 0.5 mm hexanol), the oocytes were perfused with alcohol for 1 min to allow for complete equilibration with alcohols before a 20-s coapplication with GABA (EC5–10). The solutions were freshly prepared immediately before use.Measurement of Reaction Rates—The MTS reaction rates with the introduced cysteines were determined by the effect of sequential brief applications of MTS in the resting, alcohol-bound, or GABA-bound states (21Lobo I.A.

After stabilization of EC5–10 or EC50 GABA-induced currents on more than two consecutive applications, HMTS alone (for resting state), HMTS with 1 mm GABA (for GABA-bound state), or HMTS with 200 mm ethanol or 0.5 mm hexanol (for alcohol-bound states) solutions were applied for 20 s. 0.25–0.5 mm HMTS solution was used. All of the MTS and alcohol solutions were prepared immediately before use. After washing (10–15 min) with MBS, the EC5–10 and EC50 GABA-induced currents were remeasured. To see the effects of alcohols on reaction rates in alcohol-bound states, 200 mm ethanol, or 0.5 mm hexanol solutions in MBS were preincubated for 60 s like the above alcohol potentiation experiments. This procedure was repeated until the GABA-induced response no longer changed. The normalized GABA-induced currents to the initial current were fitted to one phase exponential function using GraphPad Prism3 software (San Diego, CA) to calculate the first order rate constants (21Lobo I.A. Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33919-33927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Bera A.K. Chatav M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43002-43010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To determine the second order rate constant (m-1 s-1), the first order rate constants obtained from the single exponential fitting were divided by the concentration of MTS used (26Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The normalized current was plotted as a function of the cumulative duration of HMTS application and fitted with a single exponential function using GraphPad Prism3 software (San Diego, CA).Data Analysis—All of the values are presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.) from four or more independent experiments. Nonlinear regression analysis was performed to determine EC50 and Hill coefficient values from GABA concentration-response curves by using GraphPad Prism3 software (San Diego, CA). The data were normalized to the maximal current in each oocyte and fitted according to the equation of the form: I = Imax/[1 + (EC50/A)n], where I is the current, Imax is the maximal current recorded in a given oocyte, EC50 is the GABA concentration for half-maximal current response, A is the GABA concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient.Statistical significance of the difference between each mutant and wild type were also analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with the Dunnett's post hoc test with p < 0.05 representing significance using this software.RESULTSExpression and Functional Characterization of Cysteine Mutants—GABAA receptors composed of only α and β subunits are able to bind GABA or alcohols and transduce their effects in the recombinant system (4Mihic S.J.

However, the αβγ subunit (particularly α1β2γ2) composition of GABAA receptor are the prevalent combination in the mammalian brain (9Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 14Farrar S.J. Whiting P.J. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10100-10104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used α1β2γ2S combination for wild type and mutant GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes in this study. To assess whether cysteine mutations affected GABAA receptor function, each individual cysteine mutant α1 subunits were coexpressed with wild type β2 and γ2S subunits in oocytes. Then the GABA-induced currents (IGABA) and alcohol potentiation of IGABA were determined (Tables I and II). Most of the mutants showed GABA-induced currents similar to wild type, except for the A300C mutant, which showed little current response to 1 mm GABA (<200 nA). In general, cysteine substitutions were well tolerated within the region Ile290–Val307 of TM3. The mutations produced some changes in GABA sensitivity, with the most sensitive (Y294C) and the least sensitive (L301C) having GABA EC50 values about 4-fold different from wild type receptors. For wild type receptors, 200 mm ethanol or 0.5 mm hexanol potentiated GABA EC5–10-induced currents by 66 ± 5 and 70 ± 7%, respectively (Table II). These concentrations approximately correspond to the anesthetic concentration in vivo (27Alifimoff J.K. Firestone L.L. Miller K.W. Br. J.

The wild type or mutant α1 subunits were coexpressed with wild type β2 and γ2S subunits in Xenopus oocytes. For PMTS and HMTS, we first determined GABA-induced currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing wild type GABAA receptors before and after treatment with MTS compounds. Exposure of wild type GABAA receptors to MTS compounds had no significant effects on GABA-induced currents (Figs. 1 and 2). Additionally, application (1.5 min) of MTS compounds in the presence of GABA (1 mm), ethanol (200 mm), or hexanol (0.5 mm) did not affect GABA-induced currents in wild type GABAA receptor (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Thus, endogenous cysteine residues were inaccessible for reaction with the MTS compounds, or reaction with the MTS compounds had no functional effects in wild type GABAA receptors under these conditions (resting, GABA- or alcohol-bound states). Next, we asked whether conformational changes induced by agonist (GABA) or modulators (ethanol or hexanol) in the mutant receptors alter the accessibility of MTS reagents, PMTS and HMTS, to introduced cysteine in TM3. First, GABA-induced currents were recorded before and after treatment with MTS reagents without GABA or alcohols (resting state). The GABA-induced currents from A291C and Y294C mutants receptors were significantly changed after applying MTS reagents to these mutant receptors in the resting state (Figs. 1 and 2). Interestingly, the Y294C mutant showed opposite results from PMTS and HMTS treatments: PMTS inhibited GABA-induced currents, but HMTS potentiated GABA-induced currents at Y294C (Fig. 3). The results from A291C and Y294C mutants were consistent with previous findings that a water pocket exists around these amino acids (15Williams D.B. Akabas M.H. Biophys.

A. 2000; 97: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Application of MTS reagents in the resting states did not affect the function of any other receptors (Figs. 1 and 2). This implies that these mutant receptors in the resting states are not accessible to MTS reagents, or reaction of the MTS reagents had no significant effects on mutant receptors.Fig. 2Effects of HMTS on GABA-induced currents of wild type and mutants GABAA receptors in the resting state (A), ethanol-bound state (B), hexanol-bound state (C), or GABA-bound state (D). For GABA-induced currents, the GABA EC5–10 (top bar, white) and EC50 (lower bar, gray) were applied on wild type (WT) and mutant GABAA receptors. Black bars indicate effects that are significantly different statistically from the effect on wild type in each condition by a one-way analysis of variance, using the Dunnett's post hoc test. The percentage of change was calculated as = {(Iafter/Ibefore) - 1} × 100, where Ibefore and Iafter indicate the values of the two GABA-induced currents before and after the application of the sulfhydryl reagent (0.5 mm applied for 90 s).

Application of MTS reagents with 1 mm GABA significantly changed the GABA EC5–10- or EC50-induced currents of the A291C, Y294C, F296C, and V297C mutants (Figs. 1 and 2). Y294C or F296C mutants had no significant effects of PMTS in the GABA-bound state but showed significant effects of HMTS in the GABA-bound state (Figs. 1 and 2). The A291C and Y294C mutants were also affected by MTS reagents in the resting state. Treatment with PMTS or HMTS in the presence of GABA significantly inhibited GABA-induced currents at A291C, F296C, and V297C mutants (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Results of the Y294C mutant were similar to results obtained in the resting state. PMTS with GABA also inhibited GABA-induced currents, but HMTS with GABA potentiated GABA-induced currents at Y294C mutant (Figs. 1 and 2). The other mutants were not significantly affected by MTS reagents in this condition.Reaction of Introduced Cysteines with MTS Reagents in the Alcohol-bound States—Finally, GABA-induced currents in oocytes expressing mutant GABAA receptors were determined before and after treatment of MTS reagents with ethanol or hexanol to test whether there are changes of accessibility of MTS reagents in the alcohol-bound state. GABA-induced currents of A291C, Y294C, A295C, and F296C mutant receptors were significantly changed after applying MTS reagents with alcohols (Figs. 1 and 2). A295C or F296C mutants had no significant effects of PMTS in the ethanol- or hexanol-bound states but showed significant effects of HMTS in the ethanol- and hexanol-bound states (Figs. 1 and 2). MTS reagents applied with alcohol had no significant effect on all other mutants tested (Figs. 1 and 2). A291C and Y294C mutants were already reactive to MTS reagents in the resting and GABA-bound states. Treatment with PMTS or HMTS in the presence of ethanol or hexanol significantly inhibited GABA-induced currents at A291C, A295C, and F296C mutants. For the Y294C mutant, PMTS with ethanol or hexanol also inhibited GABA-induced currents, and HMTS with ethanol or hexanol potentiated the currents (Figs. 1 and 2).Reaction Rates of HMTS with Accessible Cysteine Mutants in the Resting, Alcohol-bound, or GABA-bound States—The reaction rates of MTS reagents with an introduced cysteine side chain are determined by the access pathway to the cysteine and by the local environment of sulfhydryl group of the substituted cysteine residue (18Karlin A.

https://openalex.org/W2161569295,"Fatty acid hydroperoxides arise from unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of oxygen and elevated temperature during processing of food. Here we have studied their effects on gene expression in colorectal tumor cells using linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LOOH) as a model compound. Its addition to the medium of LT97 human adenoma cells and SW480 human carcinoma cells enhanced the production of intracellular hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, in both cell lines, increases in VEGF mRNA and protein were observed. Unoxidized linoleic acid had little or no activity. Concomitantly, COX-2 expression was up-regulated. In the LT97 cells, the COX inhibitors SC58560 and SC58236 completely prevented the VEGF induction, suggesting that the effect was dependent on prostaglandin synthesis. In vivo prostaglandin-mediated induction of VEGF secretion is known to be essential for the growth of adenomatous polyps and their progression to carcinomas. Therefore, our results for the first time implicate dietary lipid hydroperoxide as a key risk factor in colon carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2031567073,"PrP, a cell surface-localized N-linked glycoprotein, is required for the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Recent studies have revealed that prion protein (PrP) becomes neurotoxic and prone to aggregation when it is in the cytosol, suggesting that cytosolic PrP may play a role in the pathogenesis of prion disease. Retro-translocation of PrP from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol for proteasome degradation offers a natural route for PrP to enter the cytosol, but whether PrP is subject to retrotranslocation is controversial. In this study, we investigated the metabolism of endogenous wild-type PrP in several cell lines and in primary mouse cortical neurons. Our results suggest that a portion of the endogenous wild-type PrP is retro-translocated to the cytosol and degraded by the proteasome. Moreover, we also found that calpain and other cytosolic proteases could degrade PrP in the cytosol when the proteasome activity is compromised. These results provide the foundation for the hypothesis that cytosolic PrP may be involved in the pathogenesis of prion disease.

Prion diseases are a unique group of neurodegenerative disorders that can be sporadic, dominantly inheritable, or infectious. The “protein-only” model postulates that PrPSc, the misfolded form of normal prion protein (PrPC), is the infectious agent that can convert PrPC to PrPSc in a self-templated reaction (1Prusiner S.B.

A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 2Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The central role of PrP in the transmission of prion diseases is supported by a variety of experimental evidence (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 3Caughey B. Chesebro B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 56-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Legname G.

Aside from the infectious property of PrP, extensive efforts have focused on elucidating the mechanism of neurodegeneration in prion disease (5Aguzzi A. Miele G. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2004; 17: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Chiesa R. Harris D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence revealed the contribution of normal host PrPC to the neurodegenerative process in prion disease. Using a neurografting technique, it has been shown that PrPSc itself is not toxic to neurons that do not express PrPC (7Brandner S. Isenmann S. Raeber A. Fischer M. Sailer A. Kobayashi Y. Marino S. Weissmann C. Aguzzi A. Nature. 1996; 379: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). This conclusion is further supported by a recent study using conditional PrP knockout mice. Despite continuous accumulation of PrPSc in these mouse brains, depletion of PrPC in neurons after prion infection not only stops the development of neurodegeneration but also reverses the neuropathology (8Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Because PrPC is expressed abundantly in the brains of all mammals (9Wopfner F. Weidenhofer G. von Schneider R. Brunn A. Gilch S. Schwarz T.F. Werner T. Schatzl H.M. J. Mol.

Several forms of PrP have been implicated as the neurotoxic species in prion diseases, including transmembrane PrP (11Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M.

Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Further investigation of these candidates is essential to identify which form of PrP is responsible for the neurodegeneration in prion disease or whether different neurotoxic PrP forms are responsible for different types of prion disease. Expression of PrP in the cytosol, instead of its normal plasma membrane-associated form, has been shown to cause rapid and extensive degeneration of cerebellar granular neurons in transgenic mice (14Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). This neuropathological phenotype is similar to that of transgenic mice expressing a disease-associated PrP mutant (15Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1339-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Moreover, in cell culture experiments, a significant portion of PrP in the reducing cytosolic environment gains a conformation similar to PrPSc, being highly aggregated with a signature proteinase K-resistant pattern (16Ma J. Lindquist S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This observation is also consistent with results from biochemical studies of PrP folding, in which reducing conditions can fold recombinant PrP into an aggregated, proteinase K-resistant, amyloidogenic conformation (18Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 19Mehlhorn I. Groth D.

Based on these findings, we have proposed that cytosolic PrP is the neurotoxic species in prion disease, and it may also play a role in the initial formation of the PrPSc conformation in sporadic and inherited prion diseases. As a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, PrP is co-translationally translocated into the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; HSF, heat shock transcription factor. Thereafter, it travels within the secretory pathway and is not exposed to the reducing environment in the cytosol (21Harris D.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retro-translocation of misfolded PrP from the ER to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation has been proposed as a natural route for PrP to enter the cytosol. But whether PrP is subject to retro-translocation and proteasome degradation has been controversial (22Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Caughey B. Science. 2003; 300: 917-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Aguzzi A. Heikenwalder M. Nature. 2003; 423: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Accumulation of wild-type and mutant PrP during proteasome inhibition has been observed in various cell lines and in human primary neurons (24Zanusso G. Petersen R.B. Jin T. Jing Y. Kanoush R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 40877-40881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because many of these studies used transfected cells expressing PrP under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter, a recent study argued that the accumulation of PrP results from an artifact of increased expression of the cytomegalovirus promoter under proteasome inhibition (29Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Given the central role of PrP retro-translocation to the cytosolic PrP hypothesis, we performed a detailed analysis of endogenous wild-type PrP in several cell lines and in primary mouse neurons. We found that a portion of PrP is retro-translocated to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. Moreover, we also found that other cytosolic proteases can contribute to the degradation of retro-translocated PrP when proteasome activity is compromised. These results support the model that cytosolic PrP may be involved in the pathogenesis of prion disease. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—PC3M is a metastatic subline of PC3 human prostate cancer cell line (30Wang L. Liu B. Schmidt M. Lu Y. Wels W. Fan Z. Prostate. 2001; 47: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PC3M cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. DU145 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. NT2 cells were cultured in Opti-MEM with 5% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin. All of the cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Treatment of Cells and Immunoblot Analysis—All of the cells used for inhibitor analyses were cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates. The cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After cells reached 90% confluence, the culture media were replaced with fresh media containing various inhibitors. The cultures were continued in the CO2 cell culture incubator at 37 °C for the time indicated. The inhibitors used in this study were: MG132 (Biomol Research Laboratory), epoxomicin (Biomol Research Laboratory), lactacystin (EMD Biosciences, Calbiochem), MDL28170 (Sigma), NH4Cl (Sigma), and cloroquine (Sigma). After treatment with various inhibitors, cell culture media were removed, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in a cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). For PC3M cells, 600 μl of lysis buffer/well were used, and for all other cell types, 300 μl of lysis buffer/well were used to lyse cells. The cell lysates were disrupted on ice by passing through 26-gauge needles and stored at -20 °C. To separate soluble and insoluble fractions, 50 μl of PC3M cell lysates (100 μl for other cells) were centrifuged at 16,300 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was carefully transferred to a new tube, precipitated with 4 volumes of cold methanol (-20 °C), and incubated at -20 °C for more than 30 min. Pellet fraction and precipitated supernatant proteins were sonicated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% (w/v) SDS for 10 min. After boiling for 10 min, the samples were separated in 14% SDS-PAGE (Novex Tris-glycine gel; Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblot analyses. PrP was detected by the 3F4 monoclonal anti-PrP antibody (1:4000; Signet Laboratories) except experiments using mouse brain and primarily cultured mouse cortical neurons. In those experiments, the 7A12 monoclonal anti-PrP antibody (10Zanusso G. Liu D. Ferrari S. Hegyi I. Yin X. Aguzzi A. Hornemann S. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Manson J.C. Brown P. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8812-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) was used. The monoclonal 8B4 anti-PrP antibody (10Zanusso G. Liu D. Ferrari S. Hegyi I. Yin X. Aguzzi A. Hornemann S. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Manson J.C. Brown P. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8812-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) was used to determine the presence of the N terminus in PrP. All of the blots were developed by using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification was performed on a Storm phosphorus imaging system (Molecular Dynamics). To detect the signal peptide of PrP, a rabbit antibody raised against the signal peptide of PrP was used (1:1000), and the blot was developed by using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Deglycosylation—For deglycosylation reactions, total protein from cell culture lysates or mouse brain lysates was precipitated with 4 volumes of cold methanol (-20 °C). The precipitated protein were sonicated in peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs) digestion buffer or in endoglycosidase H (Endo H; New England Biolabs) digestion buffer. PNGase F or Endo H was added to the reaction mixture as indicated. Digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h, and all of the proteins were precipitated again by methanol after the digestion. To ensure that the digestion reaction does not interfere with PrP migration on SDS-PAGE, the pellet fraction of MG-132-treated PC3M cell lysates was sonicated into PNGase F buffer, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and precipitated with methanol as well. All of the precipitated proteins were sonicated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% (w/v) SDS for 10 min, boiled for 10 min, and separated in 14% SDS-PAGE. PrP was detected by using 3F4 or 7A12 anti-PrP antibody. Pulse-Chase Analysis—PC3M cells were cultured in a 10-cm plate. When the cells reached 90% confluence, pulse-chase analysis was performed. The cells were incubated with labeling medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without Met and Cys; Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 tissue culture incubator. Afterward, the media were replaced with labeling media containing Tran35S-Label (200 μCi/plate; MP Biomedicals Inc.) with or without 50 μm MG132. The pulse labeling was carried out at 37 °C in a CO2 tissue culture incubator for 6 h. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and regular culture media were added in the presence or absence of 50 μm MG132. After chasing for indicated time, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2% SDS). To denature all proteins in the lysate, 1.5 ml of 8 m guanidinium HCl (Sigma) was added to 1 ml of lysate, and all of the proteins were precipitated with 4 volumes of cold methanol (-20 °C). Precipitated proteins were sonicated into 1 ml of DLPC buffer (4.2 mg/ml l-α-phosphatidylcholine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2% sarkosyl). PrP was immunoprecipitated with 3F4 antibody and protein A-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma). The beads were washed twice with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% sarkosyl), twice with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% deoxycholate), and once with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% deoxycholate). PrP was released from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 10 min and separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The signals were detected and quantified by a Storm phosphorus imaging system. Primary Mouse Cortical Neuronal Culture—Frozen mouse cortical neurons were purchased from QBM Cell Science. These neurons were cultured exactly according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Neurobasal medium, l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and B27 serum-free supplements were purchased from Invitrogen as suggested by the manufacturer. These neurons were brought up and cultured for 7 days before the experiments were performed. Subcellular Fractionation Using Iodixanol Gradient—PC3M cells were cultured in 10-cm plates and treatments were performed when cells were 90% confluent. The culture media were replaced with fresh media with or without 50 μm MG132, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 tissue culture incubator for 8 h. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 1 ml of membrane preparation buffer (8% sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), and homogenized on ice. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The post-nuclear supernatant (280 μl/sample) was mixed with stock iodixanol solution (OptiPrep, Axis-Shield PoC, AS) to generate 1 ml 36% iodixanol solution, and the mixture was loaded at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 1-ml 31% iodixanol solution and a 0.25-ml 5% iodixanol solution were loaded on top of the sample sequentially. The gradient was centrifuged at 186,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C in a TLX Beckman bench top ultracentrifuge. 250-μl fractions were collected from the top to bottom, and proteins in all fractions were precipitated by adding 250 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were sonicated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were used to perform immunoblot analysis. The antibodies used for the immunoblot analyses are: 3F4 anti-PrP antibody at 1:4000, anti-calnexin antibody (Stressgen) at 1:1000, and anti-Hsp70 antibody (Stressgen) at 1:5000. RNase Protection Assay—RNase protection assay was performed as previously described (14Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Human PrP cDNA was subcloned into the pBluescript SK+ vector. The PrP-pBluescript plasmid was digested with the restriction enzyme NcoI. After digestion, T7 RNA polymerase was used to generate antisense RNA probe. Human cyclophilin probe was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Costa at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Accumulation of Unglycosylated and Aggregated PrP upon Proteasome Inhibition—To determine whether PrP is subject to retro-translocation to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome, we analyzed endogenous wild-type PrP in a human prostate cancer cell line, PC3M. These cells express high levels of PrP that is fully glycosylated, soluble in mild detergents, and localized on the plasma membrane (Ref. 31Ochel H.J. Gademann G. Trepel J. Neckers L. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar and data not shown). When the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added to these cells, PrP started to accumulate. Notably, the majority of accumulated PrP is unglycosylated and insoluble with mild detergent extraction (Fig. 1A). After 8 h of proteasome inhibition, the level of soluble, fully glycosylated PrP remained about the same level as that of control cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the level of unglycosylated PrP increased to about 4-fold of that in control cells (Fig. 1B). After 24 h of proteasome inhibition, the level of soluble and fully glycosylated PrP was significantly decreased, presumably because of the effect of long term proteasome inhibition. However, the accumulation of unglycosylated PrP was dramatically increased (Fig. 1B), with the total unglycosylated PrP about 6-fold of that in control cells, reflecting continuous accumulation of PrP destined for proteasome degradation. Because many N-terminally truncated PrP fragments are present in normal cells (32Pan T. Li R. Wong B.S. Liu T. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1092-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is possible that the accumulated PrP could be a PrP fragment instead of full-length PrP. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we performed immunoblot analysis with 8B4 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1C). This antibody recognizes an epitope at amino acid 37–44 of PrP, which is removed in almost all N-terminally truncated PrP fragments (32Pan T. Li R. Wong B.S. Liu T. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1092-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Pan T. Li R. Kang S.C. Wong B.S. Wisniewski T. Sy M.S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the supernatant fraction, the signal detected by 8B4 antibody was much weaker comparing to the signal detected by 3F4 antibody (comparing the supernatant fractions between panels A and C of Fig. 1), indicating that most of the soluble and fully glycosylated PrP in PC3M cells was N-terminally truncated PrP fragments. However, the PrP in the pellet fraction was clearly detected by the 8B4 antibody (Fig. 1C, pellet). The presence of 8B4 epitope indicated that the PrP accumulated upon proteasome inhibition contains full-length PrP. Moderate Increase of Endogenous PrP mRNA Levels upon Proteasome Inhibition—To ensure that the accumulation of unglycosylated PrP is not due to an increase in PrP expression, we performed an RNase protection assay to measure the mRNA levels of PrP in PC3M cells treated with proteasome inhibitor. The probe against cyclophilin was included in the assay as an internal control for total RNA levels. Upon proteasome inhibition, we detected a small but consistent increase of PrP mRNA level. After 8 h of MG132 treatment, PrP mRNA level increased about 1.5-fold (Fig. 2). It is unlikely that this moderate increase of PrP mRNA levels could account for the accumulation of PrP upon proteasome inhibition. Increase of PrP expression should have lead to an increase of soluble and fully glycosylated PrP protein but not solely to the accumulation of unglycosylated PrP as we observed (Fig. 1). After 24 h of proteasome inhibition, the PrP mRNA level was 1.5-fold of that in untreated cells (Fig. 2), and the soluble fully glycosylated PrP protein level was much lower than that in control cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the accumulation of unglycosylated PrP was much higher, and the majority of the accumulated PrP was aggregated (Fig. 1; a 30-fold increase of aggregated PrP after 24 h of proteasome inhibition). It is unlikely that a mere 0.5-fold increase of PrP mRNA level can explain such a massive accumulation of unglycosylated and aggregated PrP in proteasome-inhibited cells. Accumulation of Unglycosylated PrP Results from Inhibition of Its Degradation—An alternative explanation of unglycosylated and aggregated PrP accumulation would be that these PrP molecules were destined to the proteasome for degradation. To test this possibility, we performed pulse-chase analysis in PC3M cells with 3F4 anti-PrP antibody. Two pitfalls could have potentially interfered with pulse-chase analysis of retrotranslocated PrP. First, the pulse labeling generally is performed in a short time period, such as 30 min. Even with the PC3M cells that express a very high amount of endogenous wild-type PrP, only about 5% of total PrP accumulated after 4 h of continuous proteasome inhibition (Fig. 1), and only about 15% of total PrP accumulated after 8 h of proteasome inhibition. (Quantification was performed using a Storm phosphorus imaging system.) Therefore, short pulse labeling will not accumulate detectable amount of PrP molecules destined to proteosome degradation. Second, the majority of the accumulated PrP is insoluble in mild detergents (Fig. 1). Immunoprecipitation of aggregated proteins is generally inefficient, and these proteins tend to be removed during the preclear centrifugation step of immunoprecipitation. To overcome these two potential pitfalls, we pulse-labeled cell in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 6 h and chased under the same condition for 12 or 18 h. After cell lysis, all of the proteins were denatured with 4.8 m guanidinium HCl and precipitated with methanol. A buffer used previously to solublize aggregated PrPSc (34Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to solublize methanol-precipitated proteins. In cells treated with MG132, a band migrated at the position of unglycosylated PrP was clearly detectable after pulse labeling (Fig. 3A, indicated by an arrow). This band did not appear in the control sample that was treated with MG132, pulse-labeled, and immunoprecipitated under the same procedure except without incubation with anti-PrP antibody (data not shown), suggesting that it represents the accumulated unglycosylated PrP after proteasome inhibition. After 12 h of chase, majority of the fully glycosylated PrP were degraded in control cells (Fig. 3, A and B), consistent with previous reports that PrP is a short-lived protein (34Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In MG132-treated cells, the majority of the fully glycosylated PrP was also turned over after 12 h of chase (Fig. 3A, indicated by a bracket). In contrast, the portion of accumulated unglycosylated PrP in the same MG132-treated samples remained even after 18 h chase (Fig. 3A, bands indicated by a arrow). Taken together, these results suggest that the accumulation of unglycosylated PrP results from the inhibition of proteasome degradation rather than increased expression. Moreover, the normal turnover rate of fully glycosylated PrP in MG132-treated cells indicated that proteasome inhibition did not change the metabolism of PrP molecules going through the secretory pathway as previously reported (29Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Localization of Accumulated PrP upon Proteasome Inhibition—In mammalian cells, signal peptides are generally very efficient in directing the co-translational translocation of protein into the ER lumen. If the increase of PrP levels upon proteasome inhibition results from increasing PrP expression, accumulated PrP, even if aggregated, should be within the secretory pathway and associated with membrane. To determine the subcellular localization of accumulated PrP, we used a discontinuous iodixanol gradient to separate membrane fractions from cytosolic proteins. In this gradient, membrane fractions will flow to the top of the gradient, whereas cytosolic protein will remain in the sample-loading region. The successful separation of membrane and cytosolic fractions was confirmed by the enrichment of endogenous PrP and a membrane-bound chaperone, calnexin, in the top three fractions of the gradient (Fig 4A, Control). The cytosolic chaperone protein Hsp70 was used to identify fractions containing cytosolic proteins (the bottom five fractions). A very small amount of Hsp70 co-migrated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 4A, fraction 2), reflecting its association with membrane-bound co-chaperones (as reviewed in Ref. 36Young J.C. Barral J.M. Ulrich Hartl F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 541-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). When the homogenate from cells treated with MG132 was applied to the same gradient, the fully glycosylated and membrane-bound PrP still migrated to the top three fractions as well as calnexin (Fig. 4B). However, accumulated unglycosylated PrP migrated in the same fractions as cytosolic chaperone Hsp70, demonstrating that these PrP molecules are localized in the cytosol (Fig. 4iB).

(2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 4646–4651; Baluchamy, et al. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100, 9524–9529). Because p300 does not substitute for all CREB-binding protein (CBP) functions, we investigated whether CBP also negatively regulates c-myc and prevents premature DNA synthesis. Here, we show that antisense-mediated depletion of CBP in serum-deprived human cells leads to induction of c-myc and that such cells emerge from quiescence without growth factors at a rate comparable with that of p300-depleted cells. The CBP-depleted cells contained significantly reduced levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and low levels of p107 and p130 (but not pRb) phosphorylation, suggesting that these factors, along with elevated levels of c-Myc, contribute to induction of DNA synthesis. Antisense c-Myc reversed the phosphorylation of p107 and p130 and the induction of S phase in CBP-depleted cells, indicating that up-regulation of c-myc is directly responsible for the induction of S phase. Furthermore, the serum-stimulated p300/CBP-depleted cells did not traverse beyond S phase, and a significant number of these cells died of apoptosis, which was not related to p53 levels. These cells also contained significantly higher levels of c-Myc compared with normal cells. When c-myc expression was blocked by antisense c-Myc, the apoptosis of the serum-stimulated CBP-depleted cells was reversed, indicating that high levels of c-Myc contribute to apoptosis. Thus, despite their high degree of structural and functional similarities, normal levels of both p300 and CBP are essential for keeping c-myc in a repressed state in G1 and thereby preventing inappropriate entry of cells into S phase. In addition, both these proteins also provide important functions in coordinated cell cycle progression. We recently reported that the transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase p300 plays an important role in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by negatively regulating c-myc and thereby preventing premature G1 exit (Kolli, et al.

Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). CBP and p300 also acetylate a number of sequence-specific transcription factors, including p53, E2F, and T-cell factor-4, affecting their transcriptional activation and DNA binding activities (2Gu W.

Mice in which both alleles coding for either CBP or p300 are disrupted die at the embryonic stage due to multiple developmental abnormalities, suggesting that both the p300 and CBP genes are required for the normal cell proliferation and development (5Yao T.P.

Patients with haploinsufficiency of the CBP gene display severe abnormalities characteristic of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, comprising mental retardation and physical deformities (7Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). These patients also have an increased incidence of cancer. Mutations in the p300 and CBP genes have been reported in several cancers, including gastric and colon cancers, and certain forms of leukemia, indicating that they may have tumor suppressor properties (reviewed in Refs. 1Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar and 8Giles R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H.

The intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity of p300 plays a role in the proteasomal degradation of p53 (9Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Previous adenovirus (Ad) E1A studies have indicated that p300 may play a role in maintaining cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. For example, E1A can stimulate DNA synthesis in quiescent baby rat kidney cells, which is dependent on its binding to p300 (13Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Howe J.A. Mymryk J.S. Egan C. Branton P.E. Bayley S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

E1A can also re-stimulate DNA replication in terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes through its p300/CBP-binding domain (16Liu Y. Kitsis R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There is evidence that p300 is involved in terminal differentiation in several cell types, including muscles, neurons, and enteroendocrine cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). During terminal differentiation, p300 transactivates p21 by cooperating with Sp1, Sp3, or tissue-specific transcription factors, suggesting that p300 may play a role in keeping cells in G0/G1 (1Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 17Billion N. van Grunsven L.A. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2047-2054PubMed Google Scholar, 18Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R.

However, fibroblasts from p300 knockout mice are unable to replicate and appear to undergo cell cycle arrest, indicating that some p300 function may be necessary for cell cycle progression (5Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CBP has been shown to be associated with Cdk2 in vivo and may be a substrate for cyclin E/Cdk2 (19Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). p300 provides a coactivator function for both growth stimulatory transcription factors such as E2F (3Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and growth inhibitory proteins such as p53 (2Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 230-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, 11Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K.

Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). p300 is underphosphorylated during G0/G1 and hyperphosphorylated during S and G2/M phases (20Yaciuk P. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5389-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, the overall roles played by p300/CBP at different stages of the cell cycle remain to be determined. Although, in most studies, p300 was able to substitute for CBP functions, not all p300 functions can be substituted by CBP (reviewed in Ref. 1Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in F9 cells, both differentiation and cell cycle arrest induced by retinoic acid are dependent on normal levels of p300, but not of CBP (21Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Mice lacking one copy of the CBP gene display some of the characteristics found in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome patients, including the increased development of hematological neoplasm (6Kung K.L. Bronson R.T. Chang L. Sieff C.A. Livingston D.M. Yao T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 272-277PubMed Google Scholar). In striking contrast, p300 heterozygous mice do not display this phenotype (5Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). These proteins also appear to play distinct roles in maintaining normal hematopoiesis (22Rebel V.I. Kung A.L. Tanner E.A. Yang H. Bronson R.T. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14789-14794Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Mouse p300-/- fibroblasts are also defective in retinoic acid-induced transcription despite the presence of normal level of CBP in these cells. In contrast, these cells maintain normal levels of CREB-activated transcription (5Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In transient assays, transcription of the cyclin D1 gene can be induced by p300, but not by CBP (23Albanese C. D'Amico D. Reutens A.T. Fu M. Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Kitis R.N. Henglein B. Avantaggati M. Somasundaram K. Thimmapaya B. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34186-34195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Other studies related to functional differences between p300 and CBP include the involvement of p300 (but not CBP) acetyltransferase activity during myogenesis (24Roth J.F. Shikama N. Henzen C. Desbaillets I. Lutz W. Marino S. Wittwer J. Schorle H. Gassmann M. Eckner R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5186-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and complexes containing p300 (but not CBP) and the nuclear proto-oncoprotein SYT in the proper activation of β1 integrin and control of cell adhesion (25Eid J.E. Kung A.L. Scully R. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 839-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that quiescent human cells depleted of p300 enter S phase without serum and that this premature DNA synthesis is due to up-regulation of c-myc (26Kolli S. Buchmann A.M. Williams J. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4646-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similarly, we also showed that conditional overexpression of p300 represses c-myc and S phase entry (27Baluchamy S. Rajabi H.N. Thimmapaya R. Navaraj A. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9524-9529Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In view of the above-noted functional differences between p300 and CBP, we investigated the effects of depletion of CBP on c-myc regulation and G1-S transition. We now show that reduced synthesis of CBP in quiescent cells also results in the induction of c-myc and S phase entry. However, p300- or CBP-depleted cells with or without serum stimulation did not undergo normal cell cycle progression. Such cells expressed c-myc to much higher levels compared with control cells, and a significant portion of them died of apoptosis after serum stimulation, which did not appear to be related to p53 levels. Furthermore, we also show that in growth-arrested p300/CBP-depleted cells, the Cdk inhibitor p21 is dramatically down-regulated, and p107 and p130 (but not pRb) are hyperphosphorylated at low levels, suggesting that in addition to the induction of c-myc, the alterations in these negative regulators of the cell cycle may also contribute to the induction of S phase. Finally, we show that the inappropriate up-regulation of c-myc in CBP-depleted cells is primarily responsible for the induction of S phase and apoptosis, as inhibition of c-myc expression reverses both these effects. Thus, our results suggest that despite their structural and functional similarities, normal levels of both p300 and CBP are required for keeping c-myc in a repressed state and maintaining cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These two proteins may have a universal role as checkpoint proteins, preventing the untimely onset of DNA synthesis in senescent or differentiated cells. Our results also indicate that normal levels of both these proteins are essential for coordinated cell cycle progression. Cells and Viruses—MCF10A cells are a nontransformed human breast epithelial cell line that arose as a spontaneous immortalization of normal breast epithelial cells derived from a reduction mammoplasty specimen (28Soule H.D.

The growth conditions for these cells were described previously (29Buchmann A.M. Swaminathan S. Thimmapaya B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4565-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). AS-p300 is a replication-defective Ad vector that expresses 1784 bp of p300 cDNA 5′-sequence in an antisense orientation from the cytomegalovirus promoter in the E1A region (26Kolli S. Buchmann A.M. Williams J. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4646-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). AS-CBP is identical to AS-p300 except that it expresses 2.0 kb of human CBP cDNA sequence (30Giles R.H. Petrij F. den Dauwerse H.G. Hollander A.I. Lushnikova T. van Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H.

AdM4 is an Ad vector that contains a promoter-luciferase reporter cassette with four copies of the c-Myc-binding site (E-box element) cloned upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter and linked to the luciferase reporter gene (27Baluchamy S.

AS-Myc is an Ad vector that expresses antisense c-myc sequences (26Kolli S. Buchmann A.M. Williams J. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4646-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were seeded overnight at a density of 1 × 106/100-mm dish and serum-starved. Thirty-six hours after serum starvation, they were infected with appropriate Ad vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 200 and maintained under serum-starved conditions for the duration of the experiments shown in the figure legends. For the serum stimulation experiments, cells were stimulated with serum 18 h after vector infection and harvested at the indicated time points. For experiments in which cell cycle analysis was carried out under continued serum starvation, cells were maintained in serum-free medium for the duration of the experiments and then harvested and processed for FACS analysis as described (29Buchmann A.M. Swaminathan S. Thimmapaya B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4565-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). RNA Analysis—MCF10A cells were seeded, starved, and infected with Ad vectors as described above; starvation was continued for 18 h after virus infection; and the cells were stimulated with growth medium containing 5% horse serum. Total RNA was isolated from cells using an RNA isolation kit (Promega catalog no. Z3100). Poly(A)-containing RNA was isolated from total RNA using a poly(A)+ RNA isolation kit (QIAGEN catalog no. 72012). Equal quantities of RNA were analyzed by Northern blotting using a human c-myc probe corresponding to 1 kb of N-terminal coding sequence. Apoptosis Assays—Apoptosis assays for p300- or CBP-depleted serum-starved cells were carried out using the annexin V binding assay to assess the loss of phospholipid asymmetry of the plasma membrane (32Engeleland M.L. Nieland L.J.W. Ramaekers F.C.S. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar) and by staining the mitochondria with chloromethyl-X-rosamine to assess the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (33Rosola A. Geuna M. Cytometry. 2001; 45: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved, infected with Ad vectors, and serum-stimulated as described above for the cell cycle experiment. At the indicated times, the adherent cells were harvested after trypsinization and pooled with the previously collected floating cells, which were washed once with calcium/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline. Annexin V binding assay was then carried out using a commercially available kit (Immunotech catalog no. PN IM3546). Briefly, the phosphate-buffered saline-washed cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1× binding buffer at a concentration of 5 × 106/ml. One microliter of FITC-conjugated annexin V and 5 μl of propidium iodide were then added from the stock solutions provided in the kit. The cell suspension was mixed gently and incubated in the dark for 10 min on ice. It was then diluted to 5-fold with 1× binding buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h using a Beckman Coulter Epics XL-MCL counter. Cells were analyzed at an excitation emission wavelength of 488 nm and at detection emission wavelengths of 620 nm for propidium iodide-positive cells and 525 nm for FITC-conjugated annexin V-positive cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by staining the mitochondria with chloromethyl-X-rosamine using a commercially available kit (Molecular Probes catalog no. M-7512). Briefly, cells were infected and harvested at the indicated times as described above for the annexin V binding assays, resuspended in 3 ml of culture medium containing 100 nm MitoTracker Red CMX-Ros (chloromethyl-X-rosamine), and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. MitoTracker Red CMX-Ros is a modified chloromethyl-X-rosamine (as described in the Molecular Probes product information sheet). This modified chloromethyl-X-rosamine labels mitochondria with a longer wavelength fluorescence emission that can be separated from FITC-conjugated annexin V fluorescence. The cell suspension containing chloromethyl-X-rosamine was spun down, washed once with calcium/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 100 μl of annexin V binding buffer. One microliter of FITC-conjugated annexin V was then added, and the cell suspension was incubated on ice in the dark for 10 min. At the end of the 10-min incubation, the cell suspension was diluted to 5-fold with 1× annexin V binding buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry at an excitation emission wavelength of 488 nm and at detection emission wavelengths of 620 nm for chloromethyl-X-rosamine-positive cells and 525 nm for FITC-conjugated annexin V-positive cells (33Rosola A. Geuna M. Cytometry. 2001; 45: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Myc Activity Assays—Serum-starved MCF10A cells were infected with Ad vectors as described above for cell cycle analysis and superinfected 1 h later with AdM4 at 10 plaque-forming units/cell. Infection was continued for another 18 h, and cells were either stimulated with serum or maintained under starvation conditions as appropriate. At the indicated times, cells were harvested in lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega catalog no. E1501) as described (27Baluchamy S.

A parallel infection was carried out to assay the distribution of the vector-infected cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases to ensure that the p300- or CBP-depleted cells exited G1 as expected. Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of p300 and CBP, quiescent MCF10A cells were infected with antisense vectors, lysed, and immunoblotted using anti-p300 or anti-CBP antibodies as described (26Kolli S. Buchmann A.M. Williams J. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4646-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). c-Myc, p53, p21, and the three Rb family proteins were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies (see figure legends for antibodies and other details). Cdk Assays—To determine cyclin D kinase activity, antisense-expressing cells were lysed at the indicated times, immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin D antibody, and assayed for kinase activity using a recombinant truncated Rb protein as a substrate (Upstate Biotechnology catalog no. 12-439) (34Sasaguri T.

Cyclin E kinase activity was assayed using histone H1 as a substrate (27Baluchamy S. Rajabi H.N. Thimmapaya R. Navaraj A. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Quiescent Cells Depleted of CBP Exit G1 without Serum at Levels Similar to Those Depleted of p300 —Our previous study showed that an antisense Ad vector expressing 1.7 kb of p300 cDNA 5′-sequence (AS-1; referred to here as AS-p300) effectively reduces the levels of p300 in quiescent cells (26Kolli S.

To block the synthesis of CBP in quiescent cells, we used a replication-defective Ad vector expressing 2 kb of human CBP cDNA sequence from the cytomegalovirus promoter (AS-CBP). To determine whether AS-CBP would reduce CBP synthesis without affecting p300 levels, serum-starved MCF10A cells (see “Experimental Procedures” for a description of these cells) were infected with antisense vectors; and 20 h after infection, the levels of p300 and CBP in the cells were quantified by Western immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. An Ad vector expressing β-galactosidase from the cytomegalovirus promoter (Adβ-gal) was used as a control in these and all other experiments in this work. Fig. 1A shows that AS-CBP infection resulted in a significant reduction in CBP levels without affecting p300 levels. Consistent with our previous report, infection of cells with AS-p300 resulted in a considerable reduction in p300 levels, but not CBP levels. This result suggests that our antisense vectors are effective in reducing the synthesis of respective gene products with a high degree of specificity despite the fact that these two proteins are highly homologous (35Shikama N.

Serum-starved MCF10A cells were infected with AS-p300, AS-CBP, or Adβ-gal (B-gal) at 200 plaque-forming units/cell. Protein (100 μg) from each lysate was separated on an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted using polyclonal antibodies specific for p300 and CBP (N-15 and A-22, respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

C, induction of DNA synthesis in quiescent MCF10A cells infected with antisense vectors or Adβ-gal. MCF10A cells were infected with Ad vectors as shown in B, and the cells were harvested at the indicated times. The percentage of cells in G1, S, and G2/M was quantified by FACS analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assays were done in triplicate, and the means ± S.D. are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether serum-starved cells infected with AS-CBP would exit G0/G1 in a manner similar to AS-p300-infected cells, MCF10A cells were serum-starved and infected with the antisense vectors or Adβ-gal, and serum starvation was continued (see Fig. 1B for the time course of infection and harvesting). After a total of 52 h of serum starvation, cells were harvested at 4-h time intervals up to 36 h post-infection. Fig. 1C shows that both CBP- and p300-depleted cells exited G1 at similar rates, although AS-CBP was slightly more effective in this regard. For example, at 36 h after infection, ∼35% of the AS-CBP-infected cells were in S phase fractions, whereas at this time point, ∼28% of the AS-p300-infected cells were found in S phase. In contrast, the number of Adβ-gal-infected cells in S phase at this time point was <5%, ruling out the effects of genes expressed by the vector backbone contributing to the induction of S phase. Both AS-CBP- and AS-p300-infected cells steadily accumulated in S phase, but did not traverse into G2/M, suggesting that these cells lack the ability to complete the cell cycle. This aspect is addressed below. Thus, our results show that both p300 and CBP provide an activity that allows the cells to remain in G0/G1 phase. Surprisingly, we did not observe a significant increase in the number of S phase-specific cells when cells expressed both types of antisense sequences simultaneous"
https://openalex.org/W2093054541,"Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) deposition into amyloid plaques is one of the invariant neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease. Other proteins co-deposit with Aβ in plaques, and one recently identified amyloid-associated protein is the collagen-like Alzheimer amyloid plaque component CLAC. It is not known how CLAC deposition affects Aβ plaque genesis and the progress of the disease. Here, we studied the in vitro properties of CLAC purified from a mammalian expression system. CLAC displays features characteristic of a collagen protein, e.g. it forms a partly protease-resistant triple-helical structure, exhibits an intermediate affinity for heparin, and is glycosylated. Purified CLAC was also used to investigate the interaction between CLAC and Aβ. Using a solid-phase binding assay, we show that CLAC bound with a similar affinity to aggregates formed by Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) and that the interaction was impaired by increasing salt concentrations. An 8-residue-long sequence located in non-collagenous domain 2 of CLAC was found to be crucial for the interaction with Aβ. These findings may be useful for future therapeutic interventions aimed at finding compounds that modulate the binding of CLAC to Aβ deposits.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5191) Google Scholar). The major constituents of the amyloid plaques are fibrils formed from the 40–42-residue amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) (2Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar). Aβ is generated from the type I transmembrane Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein by two consecutive proteolytic cleavages. The aspartyl protease β-secretase BACE generates the N terminus of Aβ, whereas the C terminus results from the proteolytic action of the γ-secretase complex (3Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Data from genetic and biochemical studies suggest that accumulation of the longer and more amyloidogenic species of Aβ, Aβ42, is a primary event in the development of AD (4Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). For instance, autosomal dominant forms of early-onset familial AD appear to result from an increased production of Aβ42 (5Tanzi R.E. Bertram L. Neuron. 2001; 32: 181-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and total levels of brain Aβ42 correlate with cognitive decline in AD (6Näslund J. Haroutunian V. Mohs R. Davis K.L. Davies P. Greengard P. Buxbaum J.D. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2000; 283: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Several proteins other than Aβ have been shown by immunohistochemical methods to be associated with AD amyloid plaques (7Atwood C.S. Martins R.N. Smith M.A. Perry G. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Some of these plaque-associated proteins, e.g. apolipoprotein J (8May P.C. Lampert-Etchells M. Johnson S.A. Poirier J.

Cell. 1988; 52: 487-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), modulate peptide aggregation. In addition, constituents of the extracellular brain matrix, e.g. the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (12Perlmutter L.S. Chui H.C. Saperia D. Athanikar J.

Amyloid. 1998; 5: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and collagen type IV (17Kiuchi Y. Isobe Y. Fukushima K. Life Sci. 2002; 70: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), accumulate in amyloid plaques and bind to Aβ. The appearance of some of these plaque-associated proteins may be indicative of a local inflammatory response to the amyloid, and others may promote Aβ aggregation or stabilize the amyloid plaques. Recently, a novel plaque-associated protein, CLAC (collagen-like Alzheimer amyloid plaque component), was identified using antibodies raised against insoluble amyloid fractions purified from AD brain (18Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, CLAC is generated from the precursor protein CLAC-P/collagen type XXV by a furin-like cleavage event. Secreted CLAC has been shown to bind aggregated Aβ-(1–42) in an in vitro binding assay (18Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the plaque-associated protein AMY is identical to the CLAC protein (19Söderberg L. Zhukareva V. Bogdanovic N. Hashimoto T. Winblad B. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Näslund J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 62: 1108-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The AMY/CLAC protein is co-localized with Aβ in plaques both in AD and Down's syndrome brains (20Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Forman M. Chiu T.S. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 69-80PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lemere C.A. Grenfell T.J. Selkoe D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 29-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and no immunoreactivity is found in cerebral vessels and brain tissue from patients with other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disorders. The collagens contain one or more characteristic triple-helical domains consisting of the tripeptide repeat Gly-X-Y, with X and Y being frequently proline and hydroxyproline residues, respectively (22Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Redd A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 1-39Google Scholar). These residues are required for the correct conformation of the specific triple-helical structure, and underhydroxylation has been shown to lead to instability of the helix (23Burjanadze T.V. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). CLAC-P belongs to a collagenous transmembrane protein subgroup that currently has eight members (24Pihlajaniemi T. Rehn M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 225-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar): collagen types XIII, XVII, XXIII, and XXV; macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II; a scavenger receptor with C-type lectin; and ectodysplasin A. These collagens have a short cytosolic N terminus, a transmembrane domain, and one or more extracellular collagenous domains interspersed by non-collagenous domains. CLAC-P resembles collagen type XIII in its overall arrangement by having a short intracellular domain and an extracellular ectodomain with three collagenous domains (COL1–3) and four short non-collagenous domains (NC1–4). The two collagens share 43% sequence identity at the amino acid level. Collagen type XIII has a wide tissue distribution (25Peltonen S. Hentula M. Hagg P. Yla-Outinen H. Tuukkanen J. Lakkakorpi J. Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. Peltonen J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas CLAC-P has neuron-specific expression (18Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this study, we expressed and purified CLAC to study its biochemical characteristics and interaction with Aβ. We show that CLAC expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells is glycosylated, forms a triple-helical structure, binds to heparin, and binds with the same efficiency to Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) aggregates. Finally, we identify an Aβ-binding motif in CLAC, the LIKRRLIK sequence located within the NC2 domain. Construction of CLAC-P and Mutant Expression Vectors—A splice variant of CLAC-P/collagen type XXV consisting of 580 residues was cloned from a human brain cDNA library into the pcDNA3.1myc/His expression vector, which contains a C-terminal myc/His tag, as described previously (19Söderberg L. Zhukareva V. Bogdanovic N. Hashimoto T. Winblad B. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Näslund J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 62: 1108-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mutant CLAC expression constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Three CLAC mutants were made. One truncated CLAC variant (ΔLIKRRLIK-CLAC) has a deletion of residues 181–188, which correspond to the LIKRRLIK sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF293341), and one substituted variant (VIKRRTFQ-CLAC) has the LIKRRLIK sequence replaced with VIKRRTFQ. The VIKRRTFQ sequence in the NC2 domain of collagen type XIII is located in an identical position (amino acids 253–260 in GenBank™/EBI accession number NP_005194) to the LIKRRLIK sequence in the NC2 domain of CLAC. The third mutant generated (ΔKRGKRGRR-CLAC) is a deletion mutant lacking residues 128–135 located in the COL1 domain upstream of the NC2 domain. These residues correspond to a highly charged cluster, KRGKRGRR, and have been suggested to be important for the CLAC/Aβ interaction. The identity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1Myc/His expression vectors containing the cDNAs described above using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Stable cell lines were selected in the presence of 1.1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen), and single colonies were isolated and screened for expression by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin. Purification of Recombinant CLAC—Conditioned medium was collected from HEK 293 cells stably expressing CLAC-P-Myc/His after 3–4 days of culturing and cleared from cell debris by centrifugation and filtration (0.45 μm; Sigma). Cell medium was applied to a strong cationexchange column (HiTrap SP/FF, 5 ml; Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. The column was washed with PBS, and the sample was eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in phosphate buffer. Fractions containing CLAC were adjusted to the same buffer composition as binding buffer (2 m urea, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl in PBS) and loaded onto a nickel-chelating column (HiTrap Chelating HP, 1 ml; Amersham Biosciences AB) equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was washed with binding buffer containing 60 mm imidazole, and elution of CLAC was performed with 300 mm imidazole in binding buffer. Fractions containing recombinant CLAC were dialyzed overnight against Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at pH 7.4. The purity of CLAC was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein determination was carried out using the micro BCA assay (Pierce) according to the supplier's protocol. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblotting was performed according to standard procedures. Precast 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) were used for analysis of intact CLAC, and 10–20% Tris/Tricine gels (Invitrogen) for analysis of pepsin-derived fragments. For analysis of multimer formation of CLAC, samples were separated on a 4–12% BisTris gel in the presence (reducing conditions) or absence (nonreducing conditions) of β-mercaptoethanol. Analysis was also carried out in the presence or absence of SDS. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-Myc antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody binding was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences AB). Glycoprotein Analysis—An ECL glycoprotein detection kit (Amersham Biosciences AB) was used to determine the presence of carbohydrate groups according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, ∼0.5 μg of purified CLAC was exposed to the periodate oxidation reaction, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and enhanced chemiluminescence. Preferential targeting of sialic acid was carried out using the above glycoprotein detection kit with a modified protocol. To determine the type of carbohydrate groups attached, a differential glycoprotein kit (DIG glycan differentiation kit, Roche Applied Science) was used according to the described protocols. The lectins used were Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA; specific for sialic acid linked to galactose), peanut agglutinin (specific for galactose N-acetylgalactosamine), and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (specific for terminal mannose). Deglycosylation using peptide N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science), O-glycosidase (Roche Applied Science), or neuraminidase (Sigma) was performed according to the suppliers' recommendations. Heparin Binding Analysis—Conditioned medium from cells stably expressing CLAC-P-Myc/His was loaded onto a heparin column (HiTrap heparin, 1 ml; Amersham Biosciences AB) equilibrated with PBS and washed with PBS, followed by stepwise elution with phosphate buffer containing 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 m NaCl. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of CLAC by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-Myc antibody. Heparin binding was further confirmed by a solid-phase assay using 5 μg of heparin (50 μl of a heparin stock of 0.1 mg/ml; Sigma) allowed to bind overnight to a 96-well plate (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Naperville, IL) at 4 °C. Wells were blocked (including blank wells without heparin) by incubation with 300 μl of blocking buffer containing TBS and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) for 2 h, followed by three washes with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T; Sigma). Purified CLAC was diluted in blocking buffer to concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 nm. Samples (100 μl) were applied to heparin-coated and control wells and allowed to bind for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with anti-Myc antibody (1:5000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h. The procedure was repeated using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000), followed by three rinses with TBS-T and detection of antibody binding with 100 μl of peroxidase substrate solution (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, Pierce). The reaction was stopped with 100 μlof2 m H2SO4, and color development was measured in a FLUOstar Galaxy microplate reader at 450 nm. Pepsin Digestion and N-terminal Sequencing—Purified recombinant CLAC was subjected to pepsin digestion. Cleavage was performed overnight at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml pepsin (Sigma) at a substrate/enzyme ratio of 10:1 in 10 mm HCl. The cleavage mixture was neutralized with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 10.5) before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Samples were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis using a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane on a Procise HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Verification of the furin cleavage site was performed by N-terminal sequence analysis of CLAC bound to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. CD Spectroscopy—Samples were dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm NaF and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Samples at a concentration 1 μm were used. CD spectra between 260 and 180 nm were recorded at 20 °C using an Aviv Model 5 62DS spectropolarimeter. Amino Acid Analysis—Purified recombinant CLAC was hydrolyzed with 6 m HCl for 24 h at 110 °C. Hydrolyzed samples were analyzed on an amino acid analyzer (Biochrom 20 Plus) using ninhydrin chemistry. Solid-phase Binding Assay—Human peptides Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–42), amylin-(1–37), and NAC-(1–35) (non-Aβ component) (Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland) were dissolved in 100% Me2SO, diluted in PBS to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (Aβ-(1–42), amylin, and NAC) or 0.2 mg/ml (Aβ-(1–40)), and incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking (500 rpm). A thioflavin T-based assay was used to confirm that the samples had aggregates (26LeVine H. II I Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar, 27Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Investig. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar). Five μg of the respective aggregated peptides (50 μl of a peptide solution of 0.1 mg/ml) was transferred to a 96-well plate (MaxiSorp) and dried overnight at 37 °C. The wells were incubated with 300 μl of blocking buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times with TBS-T. CLAC was diluted in blocking buffer to concentrations of 10, 5, and 2.5 nm. Protein concentrations of the CLAC samples were measured by the micro BCA assay and normalized. In addition, quantification of CLAC was performed by immunoblotting using anti-Myc antibody and by enhanced chemiluminescence using a CCD camera (Fluor-S Multimager, Bio-Rad) and Quantity One software. The CLAC samples were added to the aggregated peptides and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. CLAC binding was quantified according to the method used in the solid-phase heparin binding assay described above. Competition experiments were performed with the 12-mer peptide QQLIKRRLIKGD, which includes the proposed Aβ-binding site located in the NC2 domain of CLAC. Five nm CLAC was mixed with different amounts of peptide (1.0, 10.0, and 25 μm) and incubated in wells coated with aggregated Aβ-(1–42) for 2 h, followed by detection as described above. CLAC Precipitation Assay—The Aβ-(1–40) and amylin-(1–37) peptides were diluted in a 100% Me2SO stock solution to 50 μm in PBS and incubated at 37 °C with shaking (500 rpm) overnight. Aggregation was confirmed with the thioflavin T fluorescence assay (26LeVine H. II I Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar, 27Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Investig. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar). The aggregated peptides were diluted in PBS to a final peptide concentration of 25 μm. One-hundred μl of the solution was mixed with 200 μl of culture medium from HEK 293 cells stably expressing CLAC-P-Myc/His and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with shaking (300 rpm). As a negative control, CLAC culture medium was incubated with PBS. Aggregates and coprecipitating CLAC were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer (Sigma) and separated on a 4–12% BisTris gel. CLAC coprecipitating with the peptide aggregates was quantified by enhanced chemiluminescence detection using a CCD camera. A similar procedure as described above was applied for coprecipitating CLAC and ΔLIKRRLIK-CLAC with Aβ-(1–40). Aβ-(1–40) was prepared as described and diluted to 25 μm. Aβ aggregates were divided into tubes (50 μl), mixed with purified CLAC and ΔLIKRRLIK-CLAC (100 μl), and diluted to a final concentration of 2 nm in 1% BSA in phosphate buffer. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with shaking (300 rpm). Centrifugation and analysis using anti-Myc antibody were performed as described above. Protein concentrations of samples were determined by amino acid analysis. SPOTs Membrane Analysis—An array of peptides 10 residues long with overlaps of 2 residues was synthesized on a nitrocellulose membrane according to the SPOTs manual (Sigma) (28Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The peptides synthesized covered the sequences of the NC2–4 domains of CLAC-P. Approximately 20 μg of Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(1–42) was iodinated using 125I and Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Biosciences AB). The iodination reaction was carried out in 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 15 min at 0 °C. The aggregation state was assayed with thioflavin T, showing that aggregates were present in the solution. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 mm ethanolamine, and the reaction mixture was separated on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences AB) equilibrated with TBS. Before use, the membrane was incubated in 100% methanol, washed three times with TBS, and blocked in TBS-T for 1 h. The SPOTs membrane was incubated with iodinated Aβ peptides in blocking buffer overnight at room temperature (final peptide concentration of ∼0.1 μg/ml). The membrane was washed with changes of TBS-T. An Eastman Kodak double emulsion film (together with a Biomax intensifying screen) was exposed to the filter overnight at–70 °C. Quantification of the membrane was performed by densitometry. Purification of Recombinant CLAC—To characterize CLAC and to study its interaction with Aβ, we developed a method for the expression and purification of recombinant CLAC. The 580-residue splice variant of CLAC-P used herein has previously been cloned by us (19Söderberg L. Zhukareva V. Bogdanovic N. Hashimoto T. Winblad B. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Näslund J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 62: 1108-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) from a human brain cDNA library and further cloned into a mammalian expression vector carrying a C-terminal myc/His tag. The purification method is schematically summarized in Fig. 1A. Briefly, CLAC fused to a C-terminal myc/His tag was purified from conditioned medium from HEK 293 cells stably expressing CLAC-P-Myc/His using a cation-exchange column and a nickel-chelating column. Purification on the nickel column was performed in the presence of 2 m urea throughout all steps. When urea was excluded from the buffers, the affinity of CLAC for the nickel column was markedly decreased, as indicated by the elution of CLAC at low concentrations of imidazole. The samples were dialyzed and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1B) and silver staining (data not shown) showed that CLAC migrated with an apparent molecular mass of ∼75 kDa. The purity was estimated to be ∼95%. Secretion of the CLAC ectodomain from the membrane-bound precursor protein has been suggested to be mediated by a furin-like protease (18Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing was used to obtain the exact cleavage site of CLAC when expressed in HEK 293 cells. The sequence obtained verified that the cleavage, as expected for a furin protease, occurred between Arg112 and Glu113, after the KIRIAR sequence (Fig. 1C). Amino acid analysis showed that 11% of the total prolyl residues and 49% of the total lysyl residues were hydroxylated (Table I). By comparison, in collagen type XIII, ∼72% of the total prolyl residues and 30% of the total lysyl residues are hydroxylated (29Tu H. Sasaki T. Snellman A. Gohring W. Pirila P. Timpl R. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23092-23099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These differences are probably attributed to the expression system: the HEK 293 cells used here and the Sf9 cells for the collagen type XIII studies. Overall, the amino acid compositions determined correlated well with the expected compositions calculated from the cDNA (Table I), indicating a pure sample.Table IAmino acid composition of purified recombinant CLACAmino acidResidues/ectodomainTheoretical compositionAla18.518Arg19.719Asx (Asn + Asp)31.630CysNDaND, not determined4Glx (Glu + Gln)67.062Gly143.2147His10.311Ile16.017Leu25.725Lys18.238Lys-OH17.3 (49%)Met11.313Phe4.63Pro74.895Pro-OH9.3 (11%)Ser13.117Thr11.512Trp0.01Tyr2.51Val5.15a ND, not determined Open table in a new tab The Ectodomain of CLAC-P Is Sialylated—Hydroxylysines, a typical target for glycosylation, are common in collagens. To determine whether CLAC is glycosylated, two different methods were used. First, a glycoprotein detection system involving a periodate oxidation step followed by labeling of the carbohydrate moiety with biotin was used. Strong immunoreactivity was detected, indicating the presence of carbohydrate groups on CLAC (Fig. 2A). With minor modification of the protocol, it is possible to preferentially label sialic acids. An immunoreactive band was obtained with the modified protocol, providing evidence for sialic acid glycosylation of CLAC (Fig. 2B). To further determine the type of glycosylation of CLAC, we used a second method based on different lectins that bind specifically to different carbohydrate moieties. Two bands were obtained upon incubation with the lectin MAA, which is specific for sialic acid, and a weaker band was obtained with the lectin peanut agglutinin, which is specific for galactose β1–3-N-acetylgalactosamine. Thus, both these carbohydrate moieties can be found in glycosylated CLAC (Fig. 2C). No significant background staining was observed. The band with a molecular mass of ∼180 kDa obtained upon incubation with MAA is probably a result of MAA binding to a dimeric form of CLAC (see below). Deglycosylation using peptide N-glycosidase F, O-glycosidase, and neuraminidase did not induce a shift in the molecular mass of CLAC (data not shown). The failure of the glycosidases and, in particular neuraminidase to remove the carbohydrate groups could be due to the tight structure of the collagen, rendering CLAC inaccessible to the glycosidase to remove the glycosylation groups. CLAC Binds to Heparin—Collagen type XIII as well as the recently identified collagen type XXIII have been shown to interact with several basement membrane components such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, nidogen-2, and heparin (29Tu H.

The heparin-binding consensus sequence consists of the BBXB motif, where B represents a basic residue, and X represents any residue (31Cardian A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By analyzing the CLAC sequence, we identified two heparin-binding consensus sequences in the COL1 domain of CLAC. Other clusters of basic residues also exist within the NC2 domain. To study the binding of CLAC to heparin, conditioned medium from cells stably expressing CLAC-P was applied to a heparin column. CLAC bound with an intermediate affinity to the heparin column, eluting at a concentration of 0.3–0.5 m NaCl in PBS (Fig. 3A). The binding of CLAC to heparin was further confirmed by incubating purified CLAC with immobilized heparin in a solid-phase binding assay. CLAC bound to heparin in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B), and no binding of CLAC to immobilized BSA was observed (data not shown).

It is shown here that iron starvation also induces production of FrpD, the other protein expressed from a gene located immediately upstream of the frpC gene in a predicted iron-regulated frpDC operon. We found that FrpD is highly conserved in a set of meningococcal strains representative of all serogroups and does not exhibit any similarity to known sequences of other organisms. Subcellular localization and [3H]palmitic acid labeling in Escherichia coli revealed that FrpD is synthesized with a type II signal peptide for export across the cytoplasmic membrane and is, upon processing to a lipoprotein, sorted to the outer bacterial membrane. Furthermore, the biological function of FrpD appears to be linked to that of the RTX protein FrpC, because FrpD was found to bind the amino-proximal portion of FrpC (first 300 residues) with very high affinity (apparent Kd ∼0.2 nm). These results suggest that FrpD represents an rtx loci-encoded accessory lipoprotein that could be involved in anchoring of the secreted RTX protein to the outer bacterial membrane.

Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative bacterium colonizing the nasopharynx of about 10% of healthy humans. Meningococci can, however, occasionally also be pathogenic and traverse the mucosal epithelia to reach the bloodstream, eventually cross the blood-brain barrier, and cause rapidly progressing septicemia and/or meningitis. Sporadic outbreaks or epidemics of invasive meningococcal disease (i.e. in Sub-Saharan Africa), indeed, still remain an important cause of mortality and morbidity throughout the world (1Guibourdenche M.

The molecular basis of meningococcal virulence remains difficult to analyze, because human colonization and invasive disease are not adequately reproduced in current animal models. Several traits potentially required for virulence of meningococci have, however, been identified, including production of a capsule conferring resistance to serum, secretion of an IgA protease, the high antigenic variability of pili and of several non-fimbrial adhesins, and the presence of several iron acquisition systems (5Tzeng Y.L.

Microbiol. 1991; 5: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). While the biological activity of meningococcal FrpC-like proteins remains unknown, a number of other RTX proteins was already shown to act as exotoxins and to play an important role in virulence of Gram-negative pathogens of the genera Escherichia (HlyA), Actinobacillus (LtxA, Apx proteins), Bordetella (CyaA), Vibrio (RtxA), or Mannheimia (LktA) (12Welch R.A.

While HlyA, CyaA, LtxA, and some Apx toxins exhibit pore-forming activity capable of perturbing bactericidal activities of leukocytes by membrane permeablization and colloid-osmotic cell lysis (at high concentrations), the Bordetella CyaA also harbors an adenylate cyclase enzyme activity penetrating myeloid phagocytic cells, paralyzing them by cAMP intoxication, and Vibrio cholerae RtxA causes actin cytoskeleton perturbation and cell morphology changes by catalyzing cross-linking of actin subunits (12Welch R.A.

Genetic organization of most of the characterized rtx determinants is similar to that of the locus accounting for production of the E. coli α-hemolysin (HlyA). This consists of an operon of four structural genes (hlyCABD) encoding the RTX protein itself (HlyA), an acyltransferase activating the toxin by post-translational fatty acylation (HlyC), and two inner membrane components of the type I secretory apparatus (HlyB and HlyD), required for extracellular secretion of the toxin (23Welch R.A.

Biol. 1991; 217: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Some rtx loci also contain a gene for the outer membrane TolC-like channel tunnel component of the type I secretion machinery (29Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), whereas the loci encoding the RTX proteases contain a gene for an inhibitor of the respective protease, in place of the acyltransferase gene (30Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Letoffe S. Schwartz M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5046-5053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Liao C.H. McCallus D.E. Appl. Environ.

In N. meningitidis, however, neither the gene for the acyltransferase, nor the genes for components of the secretion machinery are present within the frpC locus. Instead, the frpC gene is preceded by an open reading frame, orf1 (GenBank™ acc. no. L06299) encoding a hypothetical protein of unknown function (7Thompson S.A. Wang L.L. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that does not exhibit similarity to any other known protein sequence. Moreover, the genetic organization suggests that the orf1 and frpC genes form an operon transcribed from an iron-regulated promoter located ∼300-bp upstream of orf1, where a predicted binding site for the ferric uptake regulator protein Fur could be identified (7Thompson S.A. Wang L.L. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we show that Orf1 is an outer membrane lipoprotein that binds the N-terminal portion of FrpC with high affinity and represents, thereby, a new class of accessory proteins of the RTX determinants. We propose to call it FrpD. Plasmid Constructs—For production of the entire FrpD (FrpD271) and of its shorter FrpD250 variant in E. coli, the frpD271 and frpD250 open reading frames of N. meningitidis 10/96 (8Osicka R. Kalmusova J. Krizova P. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR and cloned as NdeI-BamHI fragments in the pT7-7 vector (33Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar), yielding pT7-7frpD271 and pT7-7frpD250. The frpD271 and frpD250 reading frames were next transferred into pET28b (Novagen) and fused in-frame with the sequence encoding six consecutive His residues to obtain pET28frpD271 and pET28frpD250 plasmids for production of FrpD271-6xHis and FrpD250-6xHis proteins. Similarly, pSU39frpD271 was derived from pET28frpD271 by recloning frpD271-6xHis into pSU39 (34Bartolome B. Jubete Y. de la Martinez E. Cruz F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). pTYB2frpD271-frpC and pTYB2frpD250-frpC, for production of FrpD271 or FrpD250 together with the FrpC-intein-CBD fusion protein, were obtained by inserting the frpD271 and frpD250 reading frames as XbaI fragments into pTYB2frpC (8Osicka R. Kalmusova J. Krizova P. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pTYB2frpCΔX-Y plasmids, where X and Y stand for the numbers of the first and of the last amino acid residues of the FrpC segment deleted in the given construct, were prepared by PCR mutagenesis and/or by using the naturally occurring restriction sites in frpC. Construction of all plasmids and the absence of undesired mutations in PCR-amplified DNA were systematically verified by DNA sequencing, and plasmid maps with complete sequences will be provided upon request. Cloning and Sequencing of frpD Alleles—1186-bp long PCR products comprising the frpD alleles were amplified with the orf1-frpC primer pair (8Osicka R. Kalmusova J. Krizova P. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) from chromosomal DNA of nine representative meningococcal isolates and cloned. Equimolar pools of plasmids from five independent frpD clones for each meningococcal isolate were used in sequencing reactions to avoid potential substitutions introduced during the PCR reaction. Cultures of Meningococci—The N. meningitidis isolate 10/96 (8Osicka R. Kalmusova J. Krizova P. Sebo P. Infect.

Bacteria were washed and resuspended with RPMI medium to an OD600 of 0.2, allowed to adapt for 2 h at 37°C, and seeded into a static 60-ml culture in T75 flasks at an OD600 of 0.02. Upon growth in RPMI (without fetal calf serum) for 10 h until OD600 reached 0.2–0.3 (maximal viability), 100 μm desferrioxamine B was added to chelate free ferric ions where applicable, or 7 μm Fe(NO3)3 was added as iron source for growth under iron-replete conditions, respectively. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Bacterial pellets (2.5 mg of protein) were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm DTT, 0.3% SDS buffer with Complete™ proteinase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were precipitated overnight with 4 volumes of cold acetone (–20 °C) containing 0.2% DTT and solubilized in 2 ml of 8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 2.25% v/v Pharmalyte 3-10, and 65 mm DTT. Protein sample (0.5 mg) was soaked into 18-cm immobilized pH 4–7 gradient (IPG) strips (Amersham Biosciences), and the proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing (IEF) at 3500 V, using a gradual voltage increase from 150 to 3500 V over the first 9 h, followed by focusing at 3500 V for 31 h. IPG strips were equilibrated in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and placed on the top of 22 × 22 × 0.1 cm polyacrylamide (12.5%) slab gels for protein separation by SDS-PAGE for 6 h at 14 watts per gel prior to staining by colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250. Image analysis of sets of stained separation gels (n = 6) was used to identify iron-regulated proteins. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—Protein spots were excised from stained SDS-PAGE gels and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of tryptic digests as previously described (9Osicka R. Prochazkova K. Sulc M.

Purification of FrpD250-6xHis—Cultures of E. coli BL21(λDE3) carrying pET28frpD250 were grown to an OD600 of 1.2 at 37 °C in 500 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml of kanamycin and synthesis of FrpD250-6xHis was induced by IPTG (1 mm) for 3 h. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl buffer (TN buffer), and disrupted by sonication. The cell extract was cleared at 15,000 × g for 20 min and loaded on a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). Upon washing with 10 bed volumes of TN, the FrpD250-6xHis protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in TN buffer and stored frozen. Rabbit Sera against FrpD—Slices containing purified FrpD250-6xHis protein were excised from 10% SDS-PAGE gels, grinded, mixed with 1 mg/ml of aluminum hydroxide in PBS, and used to immunize a rabbit by three doses of ∼0.4 mg of FrpD250-6xHis. PhoA′ Fusions—The phoA′ open reading frame lacking a signal sequence was excised as an XbaI fragment from the pSWFII plasmid (35Ehrmann M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7574-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and inserted in-frame with the first 93 codons of frpD271, or with the first 72 codons of frpD250, respectively, using the SmaI site in frpD on the pT7-7frpD271 and pT7-7frpD250 plasmids. Sequence-verified frpD-phoA′ fusions were then placed under the control of the lacZp promoter on pTZ19R (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of alkaline phosphatase activity was assessed on LB agar plates containing 40 μg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate as PhoA substrate (36Gomez M. Johnson S. Gennaro M.L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Production of the FrpD-PhoA′ fusion proteins was assessed in whole cell extracts by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-PhoA antibody (Sigma). Membrane Flotation in Sucrose Density Gradients—E. coli BL21 (Novagen) carrying the frpD271-6xHis fusion allele on a reduced copy number vector pSU39 (34Bartolome B. Jubete Y. de la Martinez E.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) with 100 μg/ml of kanamycin and 0.4% maltose to midexponential phase and FrpD protein production was induced by 1 mm IPTG for 3 h. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 m sucrose, incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 10 mg/ml of lysozyme, lysed hypotonically by addition of 10 volumes of ice-cold water, and passed three times through a French pressure cell at 1500 psi. 10 μl of Benzonase™ (Merck) was added to digest nucleic acids, and unbroken bacteria were removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The lysate was overlaid on a sucrose cushion (0.4 ml of 30% and 0.3 ml of 65% (w/w) sucrose) and centrifuged for 2 h at 40,000 rpm in a Sorvall TH-641 rotor at 4 °C. Membrane suspension was recovered at the interphase of 30 and 65% sucrose solutions, supplemented with solid sucrose to 65% (w/w), and placed below a 5-ml sucrose step gradient (62–30% w/w) in 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5. Membranes were floated to equilibrium at 59,000 rpm for 40 h at 10 °C in a Sorvall TST 60.4 rotor, and 200-μl gradient fractions were analyzed for the presence of the FrpD-6xHis and LamB proteins by immunoblotting with anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and rabbit polyclonal serum against LamB (gift of A. Charbit), respectively. NADH oxidase activity was determined as previously described (38Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Palmitate Labeling—E. coli BL21(λDE3) transformed with the pT7-7frpD271, pT7-7frpD250, and pT7-7 plasmids, respectively, were cultured in M9 medium supplemented with 0, 4% glucose and 150 μg/ml ampicillin to an OD600 of 0.9. FrpD protein production was induced by IPTG (1 mm), and after 15 min [9,10(n)-3H]palmitic acid (Amersham Biosciences) was added to 10 μCi/ml for labeling of bacterial lipoproteins over additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended in TN buffer containing 8 m urea and lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the dried gels were used to expose XBU-Medix films (FOMA) for 4 weeks at –70 °C. Purification of the FrpC-derived Proteins—Soluble recombinant FrpC and its mutant variants were purified from cytosolic fractions of producing E. coli BL21(λDE3) cells by chitin affinity chromatography using a C-terminal intein chitin binding domain (intein-CBD, New England Biolabs), as previously described (8Osicka R. Kalmusova J. Krizova P. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DTT was removed from the eluted protein samples by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 in TN buffer. Purity and integrity of the proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were stored frozen at –20 °C. FrpD to FrpC Binding Assay—Wells of PolySorp ELISA plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated at 4 °C overnight with 100 μl of purified FrpC at 20 μg/ml (or its mutant derivatives) in PBS, pH 7.4. Upon washing with PBS-0.05% Tween-20 (PBST), wells were saturated with bovine serum albumin (1%) in PBST (BSA-PBST) for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBST and serially diluted FrpD250, or FrpD271 protein in BSA-PBST was added at indicated concentrations and allowed to bind to adsorbed FrpC for 1 h at 37 °C. Plate wells were washed three times with 200 μl of PBST, and the amounts of formed FrpC-FrpD complex were determined by colorimetric immunodetection in an ELISA format using rabbit polyclonal serum against FrpD (1:500 dilution) and anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate (1:2000), with o-phenylenediamine as peroxidase substrate. Absorbance at 492 nm was measured, and the curves represent the best fit of obtained data to a sigmoidal dose-response curve following nonlinear regression analysis of mean ± S.D. values from four independent determinations (n = 4). The apparent Kd values were determined as FrpD concentrations giving a half-maximal A492 value for the fitted FrpD to FrpC binding curve. Because of stringent washing and blocking of plate wells, no nonspecific signal from binding of the primary or secondary antibodies was detected when either one of the binding partners was omitted from the assay or when a mock E. coli cell extract was coated on plate wells instead of FrpC. FrpD Is Conserved among Clinical Isolates of N. meningitidis—We have previously examined the distribution of frpD alleles in a set of 65 N. meningitidis isolates and shown that the frpD gene was present in all 38 examined invasive isolates as well as in 24 of 27 noninvasive isolates, respectively (8Osicka R. Kalmusova J. Krizova P. Sebo P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conservation of the frpD sequence was, therefore, analyzed for nine alleles from clinical isolates representing all meningococcal serogroups, and the deduced amino acid sequences of these alleles exhibited 95.6–100.0% identity. Six of nine sequences were identical, as shown in Fig. 1, whereas three had a limited set of amino acid substitutions. In one isolate (175/96), an internal deletion of 14 residues was found, whereas in another isolate (263/96) the decapeptide NRINQTEEDS encompassing residues 210–219 of the predominant FrpD sequence was replaced by an unrelated octapeptide YHRYGEND (Fig. 1). Altogether these results suggest that the sequence of FrpD is quite conserved across serogroups of meningococci. FrpD Is Produced under Conditions of Low Iron Availability—As illustrated in Fig. 2A, the frpD and frpC genes can be predicted to form an iron-regulated frpDC operon, transcribed from a promoter containing a binding site for the ferric uptake regulator protein Fur at ∼300-bp upstream the start of frpD gene (7Thompson S.A. Wang L.L. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To examine whether production of FrpD also depends on iron availability, meningococci were grown in medium containing 100 μm desferrioxamine B to chelate free ferric ions, or in medium supplemented with 7 μm ferric nitrate as iron source, and the specific presence of iron-regulated proteins was assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (IEF/SDS-PAGE). Among the protein species present only in extracts from iron-limited cultures, 2M. Basler, I. Linhartova, P. Halada, J. Novotna, S. Bezouskova, R. Osicka, J. Weiser, J. Vohradsky, and P. Sebo, manuscript in preparation. the electrophoretic mobility of one protein matched the predicted FrpD molecular mass of ∼30 kDa and pI of ∼5,6 (Fig. 2B).

S35026). Open table in a new tab FrpD Protein May Be Produced in Several Forms—Inspection of the 271-residue long FrpD sequence (FrpD271), indicated that FrpD could be produced with a somewhat atypical N-terminal signal peptide, possibly promoting FrpD export across the cytoplasmic membrane. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 3A, the signal peptide of FrpD271 could potentially be processed at two different sites, with a cleavage site for type I general signal peptidase predicted between residues Thr21 and Met22 and an alternative cleavage site predicted between residues Ser24 and Cys25, possibly recognized by the type II signal peptidase processing bacterial lipoproteins. As, however, already noted by Thompson et al. (7Thompson S.A. Wang L.L. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the frpD gene sequence also contains two potential translation initiation sites located 21 codons apart, which could be giving rise to production of two differentially located forms of FrpD (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, initiation of FrpD synthesis at the second site would yield a cytosolic protein of 250 residues, lacking the signal peptide (FrpD250), but having the same N-terminal sequence as the polypeptide resulting from processing of FrpD271 at the predicted signal peptidase I cleavage site (Fig. 3A). A conclusive characterization of this possibly complex pattern of expressed FrpD forms was, however, not possible in N. meningitidis, because of the very low FrpD amounts produced (Fig. 2B and data not shown). The functionality of the FrpD signal peptide and subcellular localization of recombinant FrpD271 were, therefore, examined upon expression in E. coli. FrpD Is Exported to the Cell Envelope—To allow straightforward detection and purification of FrpD, a C-terminal His6 affinity tag was fused to the recombinant FrpD271 and FrpD250 proteins. Upon expression of the frpD271-6xHis and frpD250-6xHis constructs in E. coli under the control of strong T7 phage transcription and translation initiation signals, however, only the truncated FrpD250-6xHis protein (∼30 kDa), lacking the predicted signal peptide, was found to be overproduced in E. coli (Fig. 3B). The FrpD271-6xHis protein with the putative signal peptide was produced at much lower levels, as confirmed by immunodetection (Fig. 3B). Such result could be expected if the predicted signal peptide of FrpD271 was functional and directed FrpD271 for export from cytoplasm, since massive overproduction of exported proteins is difficult to achieve due to deleterious jamming of the protein export apparatus (39Baneyx F.

Short consensus repeats are characterized by disulfide bridges joining the 1st–3rd and 2nd–4th cysteine residues (1Reid K.B. Day A.J. Immunol.

The first four domains of β2GPI structurally resemble each other, whereas DV has three internal disulfide bonds and an extra C-terminal loop encompassing residues Cys306-Cys326.

This may be an important mechanism for regulation of the amplification pathway of the coagulation cascade, and autoantibodies in patients with APS may interfere with this inhibition, leading to thrombosis. FXI is a unique zymogen that circulates in plasma as a disulfide-bound homodimer (28Gailani D. Ho D. Sun M.F. Cheng Q. Walsh P.N.

FXI/FXIa binds to activated human platelets in the presence of high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and zinc or prothrombin and calcium ions in a specific and reversible manner (30Greengard J.S.

Activated platelets promote FXI activation by thrombin in the presence of HK or prothrombin, thereby initiating the intrinsic coagulation pathway independent of contact proteins and amplifying the generation of thrombin. β2GPI proteolytically clipped at Lys317-Thr318 has been thought to be physiologically inactive as it loses its phospholipid binding properties. However, Koike and co-workers (33Yasuda S. Atsumi T. Ieko M. Matsuura E. Kobayashi K. Inagaki J. Kato H. Tanaka H. Yamakado M. Akino M. Saitou H. Amasaki Y. Jodo S. Amengual O. Koike T.

Moreover, FXIa cleaved β2GPI at Lys317-Thr318 in DV. This cleavage of β2GPI may represent a unique mechanism in the control of FXI activation and fibrinolysis. Materials—Plasma-derived FXI, FXIa, and HK were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Substrate S2366 was from Chromogenix Instrumentation Laboratory SpA (Milano, Italy). Baculovirus vector pBacPak6 and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis kit were from Clontech Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and serum-free medium Sf-900II were purchased from Invitrogen. Hirudin, polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide), human serum albumin, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma. Plasma-derived native β2GPI (nβ2GPI) was purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT) or purified in our laboratory as previously described (16McNeil H.P. Simpson R.J.

Recombinant Human β2GPI Preparations—Eight β2GPI mutants were utilized in this study to define the binding site on β2GPI for FXI. Recombinant full-length human β2GPI (rhβ2GPI) and domain deletion mutants of human β2GPI were generated as described previously (34Reddel S.W. Wang Y.X. Sheng Y.H. Krilis S.A. J.

The cDNAs encoding human β2GPI were inserted into the baculovirus vector pBacPak6, and the nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs were confirmed using standard sequencing technology. Sf9 cells grown in monolayers were infected with the resultant constructs and were cultured 3–5 days at 25 °C in serum-free medium. Affinity chromatography with a nickel column or a rabbit polyclonal anti-β2GPI antibody was used to purify the resulting recombinant proteins in the conditioned medium. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot and subjected to automated Edman sequencing using Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). An oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis kit was used to convert Lys286 and Lys287 to Glu (mutant 2K) and Lys284, Lys286, and Lys287 to Glu (mutant 3K) in DV of β2GPI as previously described (12Sheng Y. Sali A. Herzog H. Lahnstein J. Krilis S.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3744-3751PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of each mutated cDNA was confirmed by standard sequencing technology. Each cDNA was subcloned into the pBacPak6 vector, and the recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as outlined above. Radiolabeling of Factor XI with 125I—FXI was radiolabeled with 125I using the Iodogene method (IODO-BEAD, Pierce, Rockford, IL) as described previously (27Shi T. Iverson G.M. Qi J.C. Cockerill K.A. Linnik M.D. Konecny P. Krilis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3939-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Protein Determination—Concentrations of 125I-FXI were determined by Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Specific radioactivity was determined as described by Baird and Walsh (37Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The specific activity of 125I-FXI was 2.12 × 1018 cpm/mol. SDS-PAGE analysis of the iodinated proteins revealed only one radioactive band, indicating that there was no contamination of FXI with FXIa. Binding of 125I-FXI to Mutants of β2GPI—The binding of 125I-FXI to immobilized rhβ2GPI was performed using Lockwell™ microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) as described (27Shi T. Iverson G.M.

Microtiter wells were coated with 100 μl of nβ2GPI, rhβ2GPI, DI, DI-II, DI-III, DI-IV, DII-V, DV, mutant 2K, or mutant 3K mutant of β2GPI or human serum albumin (3.12–200 nm) by incubation overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed five times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) using an automated microplate washer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). The wells were blocked with 2% BSA/PBST for 2 h at 25 °C. The plate was washed five times with PBST and then five times with PBS. 100 μl of 125I-FXI (0.28 nm) in 0.5% BSA/PBS was added to individual wells and incubated for 4–5 h at 25 °C. The wells were then washed five times with 0.5% BSA/PBS, air-dried, and counted in a γ-counter. The number of counts/min were measured and converted to femtomoles of FXI bound. Competitive Inhibition Assays—The effect of native recombinant full-length and domain deletion mutants of β2GPI on the binding of 125 I-FXI to rhβ2GPI was studied using Lockwell microtiter plates, the wells of which were coated with 100 μl of rhβ2GPI (50 nm) by incubation overnight at 4 °C. The plate was treated as described above before 50 μl of 125I-FXI (0.56 nm), and 50 μl of various β2GPI preparations or BSA (1.3 nm-4 μm) in 0.5% BSA/PBS was added to the wells and incubated for 4–5 h at 25 °C. The wells were washed five times with 0.5% BSA/PBS, air-dried, and counted in a γ-counter. The number of counts/min bound were measured and converted to the percentage of total binding by dividing by the counts/min bound in the absence of competitors. The IC50 was calculated by non-linear regression (one-site binding model, GraphPad Prism 3.03). Saturation Binding of FXIa to β2GPI—Saturation binding of FXIa to immobilized rhβ2GPI or HK was performed using Lockwell microtiter plates, the wells of which were coated with 100 μl of HK, rhβ2GPI, or BSA (100 nm) by incubation overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed five times with PBST using a microplate washer. The wells were blocked with 2% BSA/PBST for 2 h at 25 °C and then washed five times with PBST and five times with PBS. 100 μl of various concentrations of FXIa (0.09–50 nm) in PBS then was added to individual wells and incubated for 3 h at 37°C. The wells were washed five times with 0.5% BSA/PBS. 200 μl of FXIa substrate (S2366, 600 μm) was then added to individual wells and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, and then the optical density was measured at 405 nm using a microplate-scanning spectrophotometer (Power Wave™, BIO-TEK Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). The amount of FXIa bound was derived from a standard curve constructed with the known concentrations of FXIa. There was a linear correlation between the reciprocal of the A405 value and the reciprocal of the amount of FXIa within 0.008 and 0.125 pmol (r2 = 0.9945). Kd was calculated by non-linear regression (GraphPad Prism 3.03). Binding of FXIa to Native, Recombinant, and Domain Deletion Mutants of β2GPI—The binding of FXIa to various preparations of immobilized β2GPI was performed using Lockwell microtiter plates. The wells were coated with 100 μl of HK (single chain), nβ2GPI, rhβ2GPI, DI-IV, DII-V, DV of β2GPI, or BSA (6.25–400 nm) by incubation overnight at 4 °C. The plate was treated as described above and 100 μl of FXIa (10 nm) in 0.5% BSA/PBS was then added to individual wells and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed five times with 0.5% BSA/PBS. FXIa substrate (S2366, 600 μm) was then added to individual wells, and the amount of FXIa bound was derived as described above. Time Course of FXIa Cleavage of β2GPI—To investigate the time course of β2GPI cleavage by FXIa, nβ2GPI (30 μm) was incubated with FXIa (0.1 μm) in Tris-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.6) at 37 °C. At defined time points, 130 μl of aliquots were diluted 20-fold in heparin affinity column binding buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.03 m NaCl (pH 8.0)) and then applied to heparin affinity columns (1 ml). cnβ2GPI and intact nβ2GPI were separated with a linear gradient (0.10–0.35 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) as described previously (11Guerin J. Sheng Y. Reddel S. Iverson G.M. Chapman M.G. Krilis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2644-2649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The eluted peak area of cnβ2GPI and intact nβ2GPI was calculated using Primeview Evaluation software (Amersham Biosciences), and the amount of cnβ2GPI and intact nβ2GPI was expressed as a percentage of total nβ2GPI binding to the heparin affinity column. The purification of all of the proteins was completed at 4 °C using the ΔKTA prime purification system (Amersham Biosciences). N-terminal Sequencing of nβ2GPI Incubated with and without FXIa—nβ2GPI was incubated with and without FXIa in Tris-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.6) at 37 °C for 0, 6, and 24 h. Aliquots of each reaction were subjected to automated Edman sequencing carried out by the Australian proteome analysis facility (Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) using an Applied Biosystems 494 Procise protein sequencing system (Foster City, CA). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between the groups were evaluated using Student's t test. FXI/FXIa Bind β2GPI via Lysine Residues in DV—To investigate the FXI binding site on β2GPI, we measured 125I-FXI binding to β2GPI and various mutants coated on microplate wells. 125I-FXI bound to nβ2GPI, rhβ2GPI (27Shi T. Iverson G.M. Qi J.C. Cockerill K.A. Linnik M.D. Konecny P. Krilis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3939-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), domain deletion mutants DV, and DII-V but not to DI, DI-II, DI-III, or DI-IV (Fig. 1). These findings indicate that 125I-FXI binds to the C-terminal domain of β2GPI. To further characterize the residues in DV that are critical for binding FXI, we tested β2GPI-containing point mutations in DV. The binding of FXI was negligible with Lys286 and Lys287 mutated to Glu (Fig. 1, 2K Mutant) and with Lys284, Lys286, and Lys287 mutated to Glu (Fig. 1, 3K Mutant). Thus the positively charged residues in DV of β2GPI are critical for the interaction of FXI with β2GPI. To confirm the interaction of DV with FXI, we used the panel of β2GPI mutants in fluid phase to inhibit binding to immobilized rhβ2GPI. The binding of 125I-FXI to rhβ2GPI was competitively inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by nβ2GPI, rhβ2GPI, DII-V, or DV with IC50 values of 0.115, 0.167, 0.075, and 0.079 μm, respectively (Fig. 2). There was negligible inhibition with domain deletion mutants DI, DI-II, DI-III, and DI-IV at final concentrations of up to 2 μm (Fig. 2). Thus, the results confirm that DV contains the major FXI binding site on β2GPI. To further define DV residues critical for binding, mutants 2K and 3K were tested in similar inhibition experiments. Neither mutant inhibited the binding of 125I-FXI to rhβ2GPI at concentrations of up to 2 μm (Fig. 2). Interaction of FXIa with β2GPI was assessed in direct binding experiments using FXIa enzymatic activity on the chromogenic substrate S2366 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Kd of FXIa binding to β2GPI (3.86 ± 0.91 nm) was similar to HK (3.65 ± 0.20 nm) (Fig. 3). The Bmax of FXIa binding to HK (0.14 ± 0.0042 pmol) was 3.18-fold greater than the Bmax of FXIa binding to β2GPI (0.045 ± 0.005 pmol). The Kd of FXIa binding to β2GPI was much lower than that (Kd = 15.43 ± 1.00 nm) of FXI binding to β2GPI (27Shi T. Iverson G.M. Qi J.C. Cockerill K.A. Linnik M.D. Konecny P. Krilis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3939-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), indicating a higher affinity interaction with FXIa. Direct binding experiments demonstrated that FXIa bound to nβ2GPI, rhβ2GPI, DII-V, and DV but not to DI-IV or BSA (Fig. 4), confirming that FXIa also binds to DV of β2GPI. Previous studies have shown that the peptide loop defined by Cys281-Cys288 is critical for binding to phospholipids and heparin (9Hunt J.E. Krilis S.A.

Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that the peptide loop defined by Cys281-Cys288 and containing Lys284, Lys286, and Lys287 may mediate multiple binding functions in vivo.Fig. 4Direct binding of FXIa to various preparations of β2GPI. FXIa bound to nβ2GPI, rhβ2GPI, DII-V, and DV but not DI-IV or BSA, confirming that FXIa also binds to DV of β2GPI.

FXIa cleaves β2GPI at Lys317-Thr318—Nβ2GPI was incubated with FXIa at a molar ratio of 300:1 for up to 24 h. When applied to a heparin affinity column, the β2GPI consisted of two elution peaks (Fig. 5A). This chromatogram has a profile similar to that seen when nβ2GPI is subjected to plasmin cleavage (11Guerin J. Sheng Y. Reddel S. Iverson G.M. Chapman M.G. Krilis S.A. J. Biol.

The amount of cnβ2GPI generated from nβ2GPI with FXIa increased over time, and greater than 50% nβ2GPI had been cleaved by FXIa at 5 h of incubation (Fig. 5B). The amount of cnβ2GPI reached a plateau (80% cleavage of nβ2GPI) at 24 h of incubation with FXIa (Fig. 5B). N-terminal sequencing showed that there were two N termini in the nβ2GPI preparations incubated with FXIa for 6 and 24 h (Table I). The affinity-purified cnβ2GPI preparation also had two N termini (Table I). The nβ2GPI preparations incubated without FXIa for 0 and 24 h at 37 °C and with FXIa at 0 time point revealed a single sequence with one N terminus (Table I). The results indicate that FXIa cleaved nβ2GPI at Lys317-Thr318 (Table I), which is the same site on β2GPI cleaved by plasmin (11Guerin J. Sheng Y. Reddel S. Iverson G.M. Chapman M.G. Krilis S.A. J.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1629-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence from ACh, GABAA, and 5-HT3 receptors indicates that the structure of the cytoplasmic end of the channel is relatively fixed and rigid (20England P.M. Zhang Y. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A.

This would be consistent with evidence that the size and charge selectivity filters, and the major determinants of single channel conductance are located at the cytoplasmic end of the channel (12Xu M.

In contrast, the extracellular end of the channel undergoes conformational motion due to both thermal protein motion and agonist-induced gating (17Bera A.K. Chatav M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the cryo-EM-derived structure, the extracellular ends of the M2 domains are loosely packed, suggesting that these domains might possess a high degree of flexibility/mobility (13Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, substituted cysteine accessibility method studies of the GABAA receptor β1 subunit M2 domain concluded that the M2 segment extracellular halves were loosely packed and/or highly mobile (21Goren E.N. Reeves D.C. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11198-11205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We previously used disulfide trapping experiments in αβ receptors to probe thermal protein motion and proximity relationships between M2 segment, channel-lining residues in different subunits (26Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The ability for a pair of cysteines to form a disulfide bond depends on the presence of an oxidizing environment and on the collision frequency. The collision frequency depends on the average separation distance of the sulfhydryls, their relative orientation in the protein, and the flexibility/mobility of the protein in the region of the Cys residues. We used copper phenanthroline (Cu:phen) to create an oxidizing environment. Cu:phen catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, from molecular oxygen (27Kobashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 158: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We showed that at the 20′ level disulfide bonds formed between Cys substituted for the β20′ but not between Cys substituted for the α20′. In order for a disulfide bond to form, the Cys α carbons must come to within 5.6 Å of one another (28Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Assuming that the 4-Å resolution ACh receptor structure is a good model for the GABAA receptor structure, the average distance between the 20′ α carbons of residues in adjacent and non-adjacent subunits is 12 and 19 Å, respectively (13Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Because there are three β subunits in the αβ receptors used in our previous work, we could not distinguish whether the disulfide bond was forming between Cys substituted in adjacent or in non-adjacent positions. Thus, the extent of the thermal motion could not be determined (26Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To resolve this issue the current experiments have been performed in αβγ receptors where the two β subunits are not adjacent. The extent of the movements that would be required to explain the disulfide bond formation in our original studies highlights a potential limitation of disulfide trapping experiments. Because disulfide bonds are covalent they may trap relatively rare conformational states of the protein. In the aspartate chemotaxis receptor, a protein of known crystal structure, thermal protein movement allowed disulfide bond formation between pairs of engineered Cys whose α carbons were separated in the crystal structure by 15 Å (28Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, disulfide trapping may provide insight into the extent of thermal motion, but it does not necessarily measure the average separation distances. To address this issue, in the present work we have measured the Zn2+ binding affinity of receptors containing pairs of engineered Cys. Pairs of Cys can form bidentate, high affinity Zn2+-binding sites if they are positioned appropriately. The Zn2+ affinity of these sites will depend on the orientation of the Cys sulfur atoms, their average separation distance, and the energy needed to distort the average protein structure to bring the Cys into position to bind the Zn2+ ion. The Zn2+ affinity will lie between the picomolar range, the affinity of Zn2+ for peptides containing four Cys Zn2+ finger-binding protein sequences (29Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar), and the 10–1000 μm range, the Zn2+ affinity of single Cys (10Horenstein J. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar, 30Higaki J.H. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 280-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In crystal structures of high affinity Zn2+-binding sites the Cys α carbons are separated by about 5–7 Å. The non-covalent nature of this interaction provides a better estimate of the average separation and/or the energy required to distort the average conformation to the structure necessary for high affinity binding. Disulfide trapping has been used to study protein mobility and proximity relationships between residues in both water-soluble and integral-membrane proteins (28Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 32Regan L. Rockwell A. Wasserman Z. DeGrado W.

Engineering heavy metal-binding sites has been used to study proximity relationships in ion channels and transporters (10Horenstein J. Akabas M.H. Mol.

Neurosci. 2003; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Here we report that in αβγ receptors disulfide bonds form when all five subunits contain 20′ engineered Cys residues, but for the single Cys mutants they only form when the engineered Cys is in the β subunit, not when it is in α or γ. Consistent with this, a high affinity Zn2+-binding site is only formed when the engineered Cys is in the β subunit. These results provide insights into the extent and asymmetric nature of the thermal motion near the extracellular ends of the GABAA receptor channel-lining M2 segments and have implications for the channel gating process. Mutagenesis and Oocyte Expression—All cysteine substitution mutants were made using PCR as described previously (21Goren E.N. Reeves D.C. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11198-11205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). mRNA was synthesized in vitro using the Amplicap T7 High Yield Message Maker kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI). mRNA was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbamate-treated water and stored at -80 °C. Xenopus laevis were purchased from Nasco Science (Fort Atkinson, WI). Stage V–VI oocytes were defolliculated by incubation in 2 mg/ml Type 1A collagenase (Sigma) for 75 min. Oocytes were washed in OR2 (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES; pH adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH) and kept in OR3 (70% Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml tetracycline, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin). Oocytes were injected 24 h after isolation with 50 nl of a 1:1:1 mixture of rat α1:β1:γ2S subunit mRNA (200 pg/nl) and were kept in OR3 medium for 2–5 days at 17 °C. Reagents—A 100 mm stock solution of GABA (Sigma) in water was aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. 1 m stock solutions of dithiothreitol (DTT; Sigma) and o-phenanthroline (Sigma) were made in nominally calcium-free frog Ringer's solution (CFFR: 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and Me2SO, respectively, aliquoted, and stored for not more than 1 month at -20 °C. A stock solution of 100 mm CuSO4 was made in water. CuSO4 and o-phenanthroline were mixed in CFFR directly before use to a final concentration of 100 μm CuSO4 and 400 μmo-phenanthroline, expressed as 100:400 μm Cu:phen. A 100 mm stock solution of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma) was made in CFFR directly before use. A 10 mm diazepam stock solution was made in Me2SO and stored at -20 °C. A 100 mm ZnCl2 (Sigma) stock solution was made in water with 10 mm HCl, to prevent the precipitation of Zn2+ (OH-). Tricine (Sigma) was diluted directly into 1× buffer at a concentration on 10 mm. Stock solutions of 500 mmN-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid (Sigma), pH 7.3, and 100 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Sigma), pH 7.3, were made in water. Electrophysiology—Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were conducted at room temperature in a 250-μl chamber continuously perfused at 5–6 ml/min with CFFR solution. For the Zn2+ dose-response curves, CFFR was replaced by a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 0.3 mm BaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. Currents were recorded from oocytes using two-electrode voltage clamp recording at a holding potential of -60 mV. The ground electrode was connected to the bath viaa3 m KCl/Agar bridge. Glass microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl had a resistance of <2 MΩ. Data were acquired and analyzed using a TEV-200 amplifier (Dagan Instruments, Minneapolis, MN), a Digidata 1322A data interface (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), and pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments). Currents were elicited by applications of GABA separated by at least 5 min of CFFR wash to allow complete recovery from desensitization. Currents were judged to be stable if the variation between consecutive GABA pulses was <5%. Diazepam-induced Current Enhancement—The GABA dose-response relationship was determined on each cell. A GABA EC5 concentration was applied in the absence and presence of 1 μm diazepam. To prevent disulfide bond formation receptors were kept reduced by the application of 10 mm DTT at the beginning of the experiment and between pulses of reagents. The amount of potentiation by diazepam was calculated by the equation, % potentiation = (IDzpm/I) × 100, where IDzpm and I are the GABA-induced currents with and without diazepam, respectively. The diazepam potentiation is presented as the mean ± S.E. NEM Inhibition of Zn2+Binding—After a control pulse of 30 μM GABA, 5 μm Zn2+ was applied for 1 min, followed by co-application of GABA and Zn2+. To eliminate Zn2+ binding to the engineered cysteines, receptors were treated with 100 μm NEM for 5 min. We then reapplied GABA, first alone and then in the presence of Zn2+. (In some cases the effect of NEM on Zn2+-induced inhibition was tested on separate cells. Because this did not alter the outcome, the results of all experiments were combined.) Receptors were kept reduced by the application of 10 mm DTT at the beginning of the experiments and between pulses of reagents. Prior to every pulse of GABA or GABA plus Zn2+, receptors were reduced with DTT (10 mm, 5–10 min) and either washed (GABA pulses) or treated with Zn2+ (GABA plus Zn2+ pulses) for 1 min. The degree of inhibition by Zn2+ both before and after NEM treatment was determined by the equation, % inhibition = [1 - (IZn/I)] × 100, where IZn and I are the GABA-induced currents with and without Zn2+, respectively. The % inhibition is given as mean ± S.E. Disulfide Bond-induced Inhibition—Once GABA-induced control currents had stabilized, 10 mm DTT was applied for 10 min. GABA was reapplied directly following DTT to determine the extent of potentiation produced by reduction of spontaneously formed disulfide bonds. The cells were treated with 100:400 μm Cu:phen for 3–6 min, and then two or more GABA test pulses were applied. A second application of DTT was followed by a final pulse of GABA, to assure the reversibility of the Cu:phen effects. Intersubunit disulfide bond formation was completely spontaneous and did not require catalysis by Cu:phen. Cu:phen only increased the rate of disulfide bond formation. Therefore, the extent of inhibition attributed to the presence of disulfide bonds was calculated by the equation, % inhibition = [(IDTT - I)/IDTT] × 100, where IDTT is the GABA-induced current following application of DTT, and I is the current prior to DTT treatment. A saturating concentration of GABA was used for all experiments, except where specified. The range of GABA concentrations was between 0.3 and 10 mm. The maximal currents and % effect for each reagent are presented as the mean ± S.E. Reoxidation Rates—A control pulse of a low concentration of GABA (below the GABA EC50) was followed by a 10-min application of 10 mm DTT. This led to an increase in the size of the currents. Pulses of GABA were then applied at 5- to 10-min intervals to monitor the return of the currents to their unreduced levels. The peak currents were fit with the equation, It = (I0 - I∞)exp(-t/τ) + I∞, where It is the current at time t, I0 is the initial current, I∞ is the final current, and τ is the time at which 63% of the total current decay occurred. Zn2+Dose-response Curves—A control pulse of GABA was followed by coapplications of GABA with increasing concentrations of Zn2+. Prior to every pulse of GABA or GABA plus Zn2+, receptors were reduced with DTT (10 mm, 5–10 min) and either washed or treated with Zn2+ for 1 min. Currents were normalized to the initial, control current, and fit with the Hill equation, I/Imax = 1/[1 + (IC50/Zn)n], where I is the current, Imax is the control current, IC50 is the Zn2+ concentration that produces half-maximal inhibition, Zn is the Zn2+ concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient. Fits were performed in Prism 3.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To avoid artifacts caused by potential submicromolar levels of heavy metal contamination, Zn2+ dose-response curves were performed in the presence of heavy metal chelators as described (38Paoletti P. Ascher P. Neyton J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5711-5725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Fayyazuddin A. Villarroel A. Le Goff A. Lerma J. Neyton J. Neuron. 2000; 25: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). 10 mm Tricine was present in all solutions in which the final Zn2+ concentrations were in the range of 1 nm to 1 μm. Under these conditions, [Free Zn2+] was equal to [Added Zn2+]/200. 1 mmN-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid was added to all Zn2+-containing solutions in which the final Zn2+ concentrations were <1 nm. Under these conditions, [Free Zn2+] was equal to [Added Zn2+]/17,000. Solutions requiring a final Zn2+ concentration of greater than 1 μm had no chelator added. To solutions requiring no free Zn2+, the high affinity chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was added to a concentration of 10 μm. A concentration of 20–30 μm GABA was used in all experiments. Tricine, N-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid had no significant effects on control GABA-induced currents (data not shown). The relationship between free Zn2+ and added Zn2+ was determined by the chemical speciation program, Geochem. Statistics—All statistical analyses were performed in Prism 3.02 using a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. A γ Subunit Is Present in Functional Receptors—In αβγ receptors β subunits are found only in non-adjacent positions, whereas in αβ receptors there is a pair of β subunits in adjacent positions (see the introduction). Therefore, if a disulfide bond formed between β subunits, we could only know that this bond occurred between non-adjacent subunits if we also knew that a γ subunit was present in the receptor. We tested for the presence of a γ subunit using two approaches, diazepam potentiation and Zn2+ inhibition. In αβγ receptors, 1 μm diazepam is reported to potentiate currents induced by an EC5 concentration of GABA by more than 100%, whereas αβ receptors are unaffected by diazepam (40Pritchett D.B.

Czajkowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Zn2+ also enables us to distinguish between αβ and αβγ receptors, because αβ receptors have a Zn2+ IC50 of ∼0.5 μm, whereas α1β1γ2 receptors are insensitive to Zn2+ (42Wooltorton J.R. McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 633-640Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10Horenstein J. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity Zn2+-binding site is formed in αβ receptors by the β1His-267 (M2 17′) in the adjacent β subunits. In αβγ receptors there are no adjacent β subunits and therefore no high affinity Zn2+-binding site. We tested the effects of diazepam on two populations of the mutant αβ20′Cγ receptors. Half of the cells were injected with a 1:1:1 and half with a 1:1:10 molar ratio of α, β, and γ mRNA. If the cells injected with a 1:1:1 ratio of mRNA expressed the γ subunit in all cell surface receptors, then there should be no increase in the amount of diazepam potentiation in the cells injected with 1:1:10 compared with 1:1:1. To assure that the presence of spontaneously formed disulfide bonds did not interfere with the effects of diazepam and Zn2+, the reducing agent DTT was applied for several minutes before the application of all reagents. As seen in Fig. 1 (A and B), the degree of diazepam-induced potentiation in the two populations of receptors was not significantly different (1:1:1, 179 ± 70% (n = 3); 1:1:10, 108 ± 18% (n = 3)). Therefore, in our hands, the majority of the GABA-induced current from oocytes injected with an equimolar ratio of the three subunits arises from receptors containing a γ subunit. Similar results were obtained with other Cys mutant receptors used in this study. To further support the conclusion that the functional cell surface receptors used in this study contained a γ subunit, we examined the extent of inhibition by Zn2+. Two different mutants were used for the experiments with Zn2+: the double Cys mutant, α20′Cβ20′C, and the triple Cys mutant, α20′Cβ20′Cγ20′C. In both cases we injected equimolar amounts of mRNA for each subunit. 5 μm Zn2+ should inhibit more than 50% of the current in the α20′Cβ20′C mutant while having no effect on the current of the α20′Cβ20′Cγ20′C mutant. Surprisingly, the two mutants showed similar amounts of Zn2+-induced inhibition: 85 ± 4% (n = 2) and 69 ± 8% (n = 5) for α20′Cβ20′C and α20′Cβ20′Cγ20′C, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the engineered cysteines in these mutants could potentially bind Zn2+, we retested the effects of Zn2+ after exposing the reduced receptors to the alkylating agent NEM (100 μm, 5 min). Alkylation should abolish the ability of cysteine to bind heavy metals. NEM diminished currents in both mutants. However, following alkylation with NEM, 5 μm Zn2+ inhi"
https://openalex.org/W2024206002,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein found primarily in neurons, and its function is regulated by site-specific phosphorylation. Although it is well established that tau is phosphorylated at both primed and unprimed epitopes by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), how specific proteins that interact with GSK3β regulate tau phosphorylation has not been thoroughly examined. Members of the FRAT (frequently rearranged in advanced T-cell lymphoma) protein family have been shown to interact with GSK3β, and FRAT-1 has been shown to modulate the activity of GSK3β toward tau and other substrates. However, the effects of FRAT-2 on GSK3β activity and tau phosphorylation have not been examined. Therefore in this study the effects of FRAT-2 on GSK3β activity and tau phosphorylation were examined. <i>In situ</i>, FRAT-2 significantly increased GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of tau at a primed epitope while not significantly affecting the phosphorylation of unprimed sites. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that association of FRAT-2 with GSK3β resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylation of a primed substrate but did not alter phosphorylation of an unprimed substrate. Further, <i>in vitro</i> assays using recombinant proteins directly demonstrated that FRAT-2 enhances GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of a primed substrate to a greater extent than an unprimed substrate. In addition, FRAT-2 is phosphorylated by GSK3β. This is the first demonstration of a protein differentially regulating the activity of GSK3β toward primed and unprimed epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W1988283803,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a secreted cytokine that plays a fundamental role in the development of tissue fibrosis by mediating many of the profibrotic effects of TGF-beta. We present the novel finding that the intracellular pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi elicits immediate and sustained repression of basal CTGF expression in dermal fibroblasts, followed by down-regulation of the extracellular matrix proteins, fibronectin, and collagen I alpha1. To address mechanisms underlying this response, the major CTGF-regulating pathways were investigated. We report that both T. cruzi trypomastigotes and secreted parasite factor(s) antagonize TGF-beta-dependent induction of CTGF in fibroblasts. Of the TGF-beta-dependent signaling pathways required for CTGF expression, we demonstrate that T. cruzi interferes with cellular Erk1/2 phosphorylation but not Smad3 signaling. While increased stimulation of Erk phosphorylation alone was insufficient to override the parasite-mediated repression of CTGF, stimulation of fibroblasts with increased concentrations of TGF-beta, which activates both Smad3 and Erk1/2, completely abrogated this inhibition. Together with the finding that T. cruzi-mediated down-regulation of CTGF expression requires de novo host cell protein synthesis, our data indicate that the unique ability of T. cruzi to interfere with the host fibrogenic response is a complex process requiring input from multiple host cell signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1992078963,"The ability of the human heme oxygenase-1 (hHO-1) R183E mutant to oxidize heme in reactions supported by either NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase or ascorbic acid has been compared. The NADPH-dependent reaction, like that of wild-type hHO-1, yields exclusively biliverdin IXα. In contrast, the R183E mutant with ascorbic acid as the reductant produces biliverdin IXα (79 ± 4%), IXδ (19 ± 3%), and a trace of IXβ. In the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase, the yield of biliverdin IXδ is decreased to 8 ± 1% with a corresponding increase in biliverdin IXα. Spectroscopic analysis of the NADPH-dependent reaction shows that the R183E ferric biliverdin complex accumulates, because reduction of the iron, which is required for sequential iron and biliverdin release, is impaired. Reversal of the charge at position 183 makes reduction of the iron more difficult. The crystal structure of the R183E mutant, determined in the ferric and ferrous-NO bound forms, shows that the heme primarily adopts the same orientation as in wild-type hHO-1. The structure of the Fe(II)·NO complex suggests that an altered active site hydrogen bonding network supports catalysis in the R183E mutant. Furthermore, Arg-183 contributes to the regiospecificity of the wild-type enzyme, but its contribution is not critical. The results indicate that the ascorbate-dependent reaction is subject to a lower degree of regiochemical control than the NADPH-dependent reaction. Ascorbate may be able to reduce the R183E ferric and ferrous dioxygen complexes in active site conformations that cannot be reduced by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1991114542,"Although more than 100 mutations have been identified in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), the mechanism responsible for FALS remains unclear. The finding of the present study shows that FALS-causing mutant Cu/Zn-SOD proteins (FALS mutant SODs), but not wild-type SOD, are barely detected by three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Western blot analyses. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for denatured FALS mutant SODs by dithiothreitol, SDS, or heat treatment also showed a lowered immunoreactivity against the mAbs compared with wild-type SOD. Because all the epitopes of these mAbs are mapped within the Greek key loop (residues 102-115 in human Cu/Zn-SOD), these data suggest that different conformational changes occur in the loop between wild-type and FALS mutant SODs during the unfolding process. Circular dichroism measurements revealed that the FALS mutant SODs are sensitive to denaturation by dithiothreitol, SDS, or heat treatment, but these results do not completely explain the different recognition by the mAbs between wild-type and FALS mutant SODs under the denatured conditions. The study on the conformational changes in local areas monitoring with mAbs may provide a new insight into the etiology of FALS."
