https://openalex.org/W3158062106,"A public anti-COVID antibody repertoire Most analyses of the antibody responses induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have focused on antibodies cloned from memory B cells. This approach has led researchers to conclude that neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) primarily target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus's spike protein. Voss et al. took a different approach, using proteomic deconvolution of the serum immunoglobulin G antibody repertoire from four COVID-19 convalescent patients. They found that the nAb response was largely directed against epitopes such as the N-terminal domain (NTD), which lie outside the RBD. Several of these nAbs were shared among donors and targeted an NTD epitope that is frequently mutated by variants of concern. Science , abg5268, this issue p. 1108"
https://openalex.org/W3157185054,"Immunosurveillance is a critical mechanism guarding against tumor development and progression. Checkpoint inhibitors have shown significant success in cancer treatment, but expression of key factors such as PD-L1 in putative cancer stem cell (CSC) populations in squamous cell carcinoma has been inconclusive, suggesting that CSCs may have developed other mechanisms to escape immune surveillance. Here we show that CSCs upregulate the immune checkpoint molecule CD276 (B7-H3) to evade host immune responses. CD276 is highly expressed by CSCs in mouse and human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and can be used to prospectively isolate tumorigenic CSCs. Anti-CD276 antibodies eliminate CSCs in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner, inhibiting tumor growth and lymph node metastases in a mouse HNSCC model. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that CD276 blockade remodels SCC heterogeneity and reduces epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results show that CSCs utilize CD276 for immune escape and suggest that targeting CD276 may reduce CSCs in HNSCC."

Despite their ecological importance, little is known about the cell types and molecular pathways that underpin the biology of reef-building corals. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we define over 40 cell types across the life cycle of Stylophora pistillata. We discover specialized immune cells, and we uncover the developmental gene expression dynamics of calcium-carbonate skeleton formation. By simultaneously measuring the transcriptomes of coral cells and the algae within them, we characterize the metabolic programs involved in symbiosis in both partners. We also trace the evolution of these coral cell specializations by phylogenetic integration of multiple cnidarian cell type atlases. Overall, this study reveals the molecular and cellular basis of stony coral biology."

https://openalex.org/W3159825887,"As cities expand, human mobility has become a central focus of urban planning and policy making to make cities more inclusive and sustainable. Initiatives such as the “15-minutes city” have been put in place to shift the attention from monocentric city configurations to polycentric structures, increasing the availability and diversity of local urban amenities. Ultimately they expect to increase local walkability and increase mobility within residential areas. While we know how urban amenities influence human mobility at the city level, little is known about spatial variations in this relationship. Here, we use mobile phone, census, and volunteered geographical data to measure geographic variations in the relationship between origin-destination flows and local urban accessibility in Barcelona. Using a Negative Binomial Geographically Weighted Regression model, we show that, globally, people tend to visit neighborhoods with better access to education and retail. Locally, these and other features change in sign and magnitude through the different neighborhoods of the city in ways that are not explained by administrative boundaries, and that provide deeper insights regarding urban characteristics such as rental prices. In conclusion, our work suggests that the qualities of a 15-minutes city can be measured at scale, delivering actionable insights on the polycentric structure of cities, and how people use and access this structure."
https://openalex.org/W3158786731,"The clinical performance of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in the treatment of ErbB2-positive unresectable gastric cancer (GC) is severely hampered by the emergence of molecular resistance. Trastuzumab's target epitope is localized within the extracellular domain of the oncogenic cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) ErbB2, which is known to undergo extensive N-linked glycosylation. However, the site-specific glycan repertoire of ErbB2, as well as the detailed molecular mechanisms through which specific aberrant glycan signatures functionally impact the malignant features of ErbB2-addicted GC cells, including the acquisition of trastuzumab resistance, remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ErbB2 is modified with both α2,6- and α2,3-sialylated glycan structures in GC clinical specimens. In-depth mass spectrometry-based glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of ErbB2's ectodomain disclosed a site-specific glycosylation profile in GC cells, in which the ST6Gal1 sialyltransferase specifically targets ErbB2 N-glycosylation sites occurring within the receptor's trastuzumab-binding domain. Abrogation of ST6Gal1 expression reshaped the cellular and ErbB2-specific glycomes, expanded the cellular half-life of the ErbB2 receptor, and sensitized ErbB2-dependent GC cells to trastuzumab-induced cytotoxicity through the stabilization of ErbB dimers at the cell membrane, and the decreased activation of both ErbB2 and EGFR RTKs. Overall, our data demonstrates that ST6Gal1-mediated aberrant α2,6-sialylation actively tunes the resistance of ErbB2-driven GC cells to trastuzumab."
https://openalex.org/W3159425624,"Intramuscular fatty deposits, which are seen in muscular dystrophies and with aging, negatively affect muscle function. The cells of origin of adipocytes constituting these fatty deposits are mesenchymal stromal cells, fibroadipogenic progenitors (FAPs). We uncover a molecular fate switch, involving miR-206 and the transcription factor Runx1, that controls FAP differentiation to adipocytes. Mice deficient in miR-206 exhibit increased adipogenesis following muscle injury. Adipogenic differentiation of FAPs is abrogated by miR-206 mimics. Using a labeled microRNA (miRNA) pull-down and sequencing (LAMP-seq), we identified Runx1 as a miR-206 target, with miR-206 repressing Runx1 translation. In the absence of miR-206 in FAPs, Runx1 occupancy near transcriptional start sites of adipogenic genes and expression of these genes increase. We demonstrate that miR-206 mimicry in vivo limits intramuscular fatty infiltration. Our results provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of FAP fate determination and formation of harmful fatty deposits in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3159053485,"Background SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and reactivation has mostly been described in case reports. We therefore investigated the epidemiology of recurrent COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2. Methods Among patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 11 and July 31, 2020 within an integrated healthcare system, we identified patients with a recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay ≥60 days after an initial positive test. To assign an overall likelihood of COVID-19 recurrence, we combined quantitative data from initial and recurrent positive RT-PCR cycle thresholds—a value inversely correlated with viral RNA burden— with a clinical recurrence likelihood assigned based on independent, standardized case review by two physicians. “Probable” or “possible” recurrence by clinical assessment was confirmed as the final recurrence likelihood only if a cycle threshold value obtained ≥60 days after initial testing was lower than its preceding cycle threshold or if the patient had an interval negative RT-PCR. Results Among 23,176 patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, 1,301 (5.6%) had at least one additional SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs assay ≥60 days later. Of 122 testing positive, 114 had sufficient data for evaluation. The median interval to the recurrent positive RT-PCR was 85.5 (IQR 74–107) days. After combining clinical and RT-PCR cycle threshold data, four patients (3.5%) met criteria for probable COVID-19 recurrence. All four exhibited symptoms at recurrence and three required a higher level of medical care compared to their initial diagnosis. After including six additional patients (5.3%) with possible recurrence, recurrence incidence was 4.3 (95% CI 2.1–7.9) cases per 10,000 COVID-19 patients. Conclusions Only 0.04% of all COVID-19 patients in our health system experienced probable or possible recurrence; 90% of repeat positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs were not consistent with true recurrence. Our pragmatic approach combining clinical and quantitative RT-PCR data could aid assessment of COVID-19 reinfection or reactivation by clinicians and public health personnel."
https://openalex.org/W3123235635,"Measuring violence against women raises methodological questions, as well as the wider question of how to understand violence and locate it in relation to a societal context. This is all the more relevant given that measurement of violence against women in the EU has made an interesting phenomenon apparent, the so-called ‘Nordic Paradox’, whereby prevalence is higher in more gender equal countries. This article examines this phenomenon by exploring a range of factors—methodological, demographic and societal—to contextualise disclosed levels of violence. The analysis makes use of a multilevel analytic approach to take into account how macro and micro levels contribute to the prevalence of violence. The intercepts are then used to illustrate how taking these into account might provide an alternative ranking of levels of violence against women in EU countries. The results show that the ‘Nordic Paradox’ disappears—and can be undone—when factors at individual and country levels are considered. We conclude that the ‘Nordic Paradox’ cannot be understood independently from a wider pattern of violence in society, and should be seen as connected and co-constituted in specific formations, domains or regimes of violence. Our results show that the use of multi-level models can provide new insights into the factors that may be related to disclosed prevalence of violence against women. This can generate a better understanding of how violence against women functions as a system, and in turn inform better policy responses."
https://openalex.org/W3158278730,"The unique physical embodiment of robots enables physical contact between machines and humans. Since interpersonal touch research has demonstrated that touch has several positive behavioral (e.g., reduced stress, better immune functioning) as well as evaluative consequences (e.g., better evaluation of the initiator of touch), the question arises whether touch from a humanoid robot, the body of which is somewhat similar to that of a human, can evoke similar effects. To answer this question, we conducted a between-subjects experiment in the laboratory with n = 48 students who encountered a humanoid robot (Softbank Robotics’ NAO) that either did or did not touch their hand in a non-functional manner during a counseling conversation. The analyses of participants’ behavior revealed that they mostly reacted by smiling and laughing. Furthermore, participants who were touched by the robot complied significantly more frequently with a request posed by the robot during conversation, and reported better feelings compared to those who were not touched. However, there were no effects of robot touch on subjective evaluations of the robot or on the interaction experience."
https://openalex.org/W3158717583,"Multi-drug resistant (MDR) non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) is a public health concern globally. This study reports the phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of NTS isolates from bovine lymph nodes (n = 48) and ground beef (n = 29). Furthermore, we compared genotypic AMR data of our isolates with those of publicly available NTS genomes from Mexico (n = 2400). The probability of finding MDR isolates was higher in ground beef than in lymph nodes: χ 2 = 12.0, P = 0.0005. The most common resistant phenotypes involved tetracycline (40.3%), carbenicillin (26.0%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (20.8%), chloramphenicol (19.5%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (16.9%), while more than 55% of the isolates showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and 26% were MDR. Conversely, resistance to cephalosporins and carbapenems was infrequent (0–9%). MDR phenotypes were strongly associated with NTS serovar ( χ 2 = 24.5, P&lt;0.0001), with Typhimurium accounting for 40% of MDR strains. Most of these (9/10), carried Salmonella genomic island 1, which harbors a class-1 integron with multiple AMR genes ( aadA2 , blaCARB-2 , floR , sul1 , tetG ) that confer a penta-resistant phenotype. MDR phenotypes were also associated with mutations in the ramR gene ( χ 2 = 17.7, P&lt;0.0001). Among public NTS isolates from Mexico, those from cattle and poultry had the highest proportion of MDR genotypes. Our results suggest that attaining significant improvements in AMR meat safety requires the identification and removal (or treatment) of product harboring MDR NTS, instead of screening for Salmonella spp. or for isolates showing resistance to individual antibiotics. In that sense, massive integration of whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies in AMR surveillance provides the shortest path to accomplish these goals."
https://openalex.org/W3157211982,"Capillary endothelial cells (ECs) maintain a semi-permeable barrier between the blood and tissue by forming inter-EC tight junctions (TJs), regulating selective transport of fluid and solutes. Overwhelming inflammation, as occurs in sepsis, disrupts these TJs, leading to leakage of fluid, proteins, and small molecules into the tissues. Mechanistically, disruption of capillary barrier function is mediated by small Rho-GTPases, such as RhoA, -B, and -C, which are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and disrupted by GTPase-activating factors (GAPs). We previously reported that a mutation in a specific RhoB GAP (p190BRhoGAP) underlays a hereditary capillary leak syndrome. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment disrupts TJs in cultured human microvascular ECs, a model of capillary leak. This response requires new gene transcription and involves increased RhoB activation. However, the specific GEF that activates RhoB in capillary ECs remains unknown. Transcriptional profiling of cultured tight junction-forming human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) revealed that 17 GEFs were significantly induced by TNF. The function of each candidate GEF was assessed by short interfering RNA depletion and trans-endothelial electrical resistance screening. Knockown of ArhGEF10 reduced the TNF-induced loss of barrier which was phenocopied by RhoB or dual ArhGEF10/RhoB knockdown. ArhGEF10 knockdown also reduced the extent of TNF-induced RhoB activation and disruption at tight junctions. In a cell-free assay, immunoisolated ArhGEF10 selectively catalyzed nucleotide exchange to activate RhoB, but not RhoA or RhoC. We conclude ArhGEF10 is a TNF-induced RhoB-selective GEF that mediates TJ disruption and barrier loss in human capillary endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W3157381919,"Background Community participation in health care delivery will ensure service availability and accessibility and guarantee community ownership of the program. Community-based strategies such as the involvement of Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) and Community Health Management Committees (CHMCs) are likely to advance primary healthcare in general, but the criteria for selecting CHVs, CHMCs and efforts to sustain these roles are not clear 20 years after implementing the Community-based Health Planning Services program. We examined the process of selecting these cadres of community health workers and their current role within Ghana’s flagship program for primary care–the Community-based Health Planning and Services program. Methods This was an exploratory study design using qualitative methods to appraise the health system and stakeholder participation in Community-based Health Planning and Services program implementation in the Upper East region of Ghana. We conducted 51 in-depth interviews and 33 focus group discussions with health professionals and community members. Results Community Health Volunteers and Community Health Management Committees are the representatives of the community in the routine implementation of the Community-based Health Planning and Services program. They are selected, appointed, or nominated by their communities. Some inherit the position through apprenticeship and others are recruited through advertisement. The selection is mostly initiated by the health providers and carried out by community members. Community Health Volunteers lead community mobilization efforts, support health providers in health promotion activities, manage minor illnesses, and encourage pregnant women to use maternal health services. Community Health Volunteers also translate health messages delivered by health providers to the people in their local languages. Community Health Management Committees mobilize resources for the development of Community-based Health Planning and Services program compounds. They play a mediatory role between health providers in the health compounds and the community members. Volunteers are sometimes given non-financial incentives but there are suggestions to include financial incentives. Conclusion Community Health Volunteers and Community Health Management Committees play a critical role in primary health care. The criteria for selecting Community Health Volunteers and Community Health Management Committees vary but need to be standardized to ensure that only self-motivated individuals are selected. Thus, CHVs and CHMCs should contest for their positions and be endorsed by their community members and assigned roles by health professionals in the CHPS zones. Efforts to sustain them within the health system should include the provision of financial incentives."
https://openalex.org/W3159539353,"Porphyran and its derivatives possess a variety of biological activities, such as ameliorations of oxidative stress, inflammation, hyperlipemia, and immune deficiencies. In this study, we evaluated the potential efficacy of porphyran-derived oligosaccharides from Porphyra yezoensis (PYOs) in alleviating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and preliminarily clarified the underlying mechanism. NAFLD was induced by a high-fat diet for six months in C57BL/6J mice, followed by treatment with PYOs (100 or 300 mg/kg/d) for another six weeks. We found that PYOs reduced hepatic oxidative stress in mice with NAFLD, which plays a critical role in the occurrence and development of NAFLD. In addition, PYOs could markedly decrease lipid accumulation in liver by activating the IRS-1/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway and the AMPK signaling pathway in mice with NAFLD. PYOs also apparently relieved the hepatic fibrosis induced by oxidative stress via downregulation of TGF-β and its related proteins, so that liver injury was markedly alleviated. Furthermore, PYOs treatment relieved cecal microbiota dysbiosis (such as increasing the relative abundance of Akkermansia, while decreasing the Helicobacter abundance), which could alleviate oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, and protect the liver to a certain degree. In summary, PYOs treatment remarkably improved NAFLD via a specific molecular mechanism and reshaped the cecal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3157549610,"The interphase nucleus is functionally organized in active and repressed territories defining the transcriptional status of the cell. However, it remains poorly understood how the nuclear architecture of neurons adapts in response to behaviorally relevant stimuli that trigger fast alterations in gene expression patterns. Imaging of fluorescently tagged nucleosomes revealed that pharmacological manipulation of neuronal activity in vitro and auditory cued fear conditioning in vivo induce nucleus-scale restructuring of chromatin within minutes. Furthermore, the acquisition of auditory fear memory is impaired after infusion of a drug into auditory cortex which blocks chromatin reorganization in vitro . We propose that active chromatin movements at the nucleus scale act together with local gene-specific modifications to enable transcriptional adaptations at fast time scales. Introducing a transgenic mouse line for photolabeling of histones, we extend the realm of systems available for imaging of chromatin dynamics to living animals."
https://openalex.org/W3159698556,"Sleep is a physiologic necessity for all humankind. Pregnant women, in particular, need adequate sleep to develop their fetuses as well as save energy required for delivery. A change in sleep quality and quantity is the most common phenomena during pregnancy due to mechanical and hormonal factors. However, there is a scarcity of data about poor sleep quality and its associated factors among pregnant mothers in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aims to determine the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its associated factors among pregnant mothers at Wadila primary hospital, Ethiopia.Institution based cross-sectional study design was employed on 411 pregnant mothers. Data were collected using a pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaire. SPSS Version 23 for Windows software was used for data analyses. Bivariate analysis was conducted to detect the association between dependent and independent variables, and to choose candidate variables (p < 0.25) for multivariate logistic regression. Statistical significance was set at p-value <0.05.A total of 411 participants were included in the study making a response rate of 97.4%. Overall, 68.4% of participants found to have poor sleep quality (PSQI>5). Age of the mother [age 20-30 years; AOR = 4.3 CI (1.8, 9.9), p = 0.001, and age >30 years; AOR = 4.7 CI (1.6, 13.9) p = 0.005], gestational age [second trimester, AOR = 2.46, CI (1.2, 4.9), p = 0.01 and third trimester, AOR = 7.5, CI (3.2, 17.8), p = 0.000] and parity [multiparous women; AOR = 2.1(1.24, 3.6) p = 0.006] were predictor variables for poor sleep quality among pregnant mothers.More than two-third of pregnant mothers had poor sleep quality. Advanced maternal age, increased gestational age and multiparty are found to be predictors of poor sleep quality in pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W3159844480,"Mass graves are usually key historical markers with strong incentive for archeological investigations. The identification of individuals buried in mass graves has long benefitted from traditional historical, archaeological, anthropological and paleopathological techniques. The addition of novel methods including genetic, genomic and isotopic geochemistry have renewed interest in solving unidentified mass graves. In this study, we demonstrate that the combined use of these techniques allows the identification of the individuals found in two Breton historical mass graves, where one method alone would not have revealed the importance of this discovery. The skeletons likely belong to soldiers from the two enemy armies who fought during a major event of Breton history: the siege of Rennes in 1491, which ended by the wedding of the Duchess of Brittany with the King of France and signaled the end of the independence of the region. Our study highlights the value of interdisciplinary approaches with a particular emphasis on increasingly accurate isotopic markers. The development of the sulfur isoscape and testing of the triple isotope geographic assignment are detailed in a companion paper [13]."
https://openalex.org/W3157230981,"The reintroduced red wolf ( Canis rufus ) population in northeastern North Carolina declined to 7 known wolves by October 2020, the majority of which is due to poaching (illegal killing), the major component of verified anthropogenic mortality in this and many other carnivore populations. Poaching is still not well understood and is often underestimated, partly as a result of cryptic poaching, when poachers conceal evidence. Cryptic poaching inhibits our understanding of the causes and consequences of anthropogenic mortality, which is important to conservation as it can inform us about future population patterns within changing political and human landscapes. We estimate risk for marked adult red wolves of 5 causes of death (COD: legal, nonhuman, unknown, vehicle and poached) and disappearance, describe variation in COD in relation to hunting season, and compare time to disappearance or death. We include unknown fates in our risk estimates. We found that anthropogenic COD accounted for 0.78–0.85 of 508 marked animals, including poaching and cryptic poaching, which we estimated at 0.51–0.64. Risk of poaching and disappearance was significantly higher during hunting season. Mean time from collaring until nonhuman COD averaged 376 days longer than time until poached and 642 days longer than time until disappearance. Our estimates of risk differed from prior published estimates, as expected by accounting for unknown fates explicitly. We quantify the effects on risk for three scenarios for unknown fates, which span conservative to most likely COD. Implementing proven practices that prevent poaching or hasten successful reintroduction may reverse the decline to extinction in the wild of this critically endangered population. Our findings add to a growing literature on endangered species protections and enhancing the science used to measure poaching worldwide."

In this study, a multiplex thermostable recombinase polymerase amplification-lateral flow detection (RPA-LFD) assay was established, and the reaction conditions such as the ratio of primer concentration, magnesium ion concentration, amplification time and template DNA concentration in the multiplex RPA reaction were optimized. The optimized multiplex RPA-LFD method was used to detect both CT and NG positive control plasmids, and it was found that the LFD could be used to obtain visible results when the plasmid copy number was only 200. The sensitivity of the multiplex RPA-LFD method used for clinical samples was 85.62 (95% CI at 53.66-97.29) for NG detection and 90.90 (95% CI at 57.12-99.52) for CT detection."
https://openalex.org/W3159116878,"Background Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are widely used to reduce hyperglycemia. The present study investigated the effects of a SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, on hyperglycemia in a novel rat model of non-obesity type 2 diabetes with enlarged kidney (DEK). Methods Male DEK rats with non-fasting blood glucose concentrations ≤300 mg/dl and &gt;300 mg/dl were classified as nondiabetic and diabetic, respectively. Groups of nondiabetic (control) and diabetic (DM-cont) rats were fed standard chow for 12 weeks, whereas another group of diabetic (DM-empa) rats was fed standard chow containing empagliflozin (300 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Blood glucose, body weight, glucose tolerance, food and water intake, urinary volume, plasma and urinary biochemical parameters, and bone mineral density were measured, and their kidneys and pancreas histologically analyzed. Results Treatment with empagliflozin reduced blood glucose concentration and food intake in diabetic rats, but inhibited loss of adeps renis and led to body weight gain. Empagliflozin attenuated polyuria and polydipsia but increased plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, sodium and total protein toward normal level. Empagliflozin also significantly reduced urinary excretion of proteins and electrolytes and restored bone mineral density and plasma concentrations of valine and isoleucine to normal levels. Moreover, dilation of renal tubules and kidney enlargement were not attenuated in the DM-empa group. Conclusion The response of DEK rats to empagliflozin differed from that of other diabetic animal models, suggesting that DEK rats have unique characters for studying and evaluating the multiple biological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. These findings also indicted that empagliflozin could ameliorate systemic metabolism and improve renal tubule function in diabetic condition."
https://openalex.org/W3157307328,"Occupational stress is associated with adverse outcomes for medical professionals and patients. In our cross-sectional study with 136 general practices, 26.4% of 550 practice assistants showed high chronic stress. As machine learning strategies offer the opportunity to improve understanding of chronic stress by exploiting complex interactions between variables, we used data from our previous study to derive the best analytic model for chronic stress: four common machine learning (ML) approaches are compared to a classical statistical procedure.We applied four machine learning classifiers (random forest, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors', and artificial neural network) and logistic regression as standard approach to analyze factors contributing to chronic stress in practice assistants. Chronic stress had been measured by the standardized, self-administered TICS-SSCS questionnaire. The performance of these models was compared in terms of predictive accuracy based on the 'operating area under the curve' (AUC), sensitivity, and positive predictive value.Compared to the standard logistic regression model (AUC 0.636, 95% CI 0.490-0.674), all machine learning models improved prediction: random forest +20.8% (AUC 0.844, 95% CI 0.684-0.843), artificial neural network +12.4% (AUC 0.760, 95% CI 0.605-0.777), support vector machine +15.1% (AUC 0.787, 95% CI 0.634-0.802), and K-nearest neighbours +7.1% (AUC 0.707, 95% CI 0.556-0.735). As best prediction model, random forest showed a sensitivity of 99% and a positive predictive value of 79%. Using the variable frequencies at the decision nodes of the random forest model, the following five work characteristics influence chronic stress: too much work, high demand to concentrate, time pressure, complicated tasks, and insufficient support by practice leaders.Regarding chronic stress prediction, machine learning classifiers, especially random forest, provided more accurate prediction compared to classical logistic regression. Interventions to reduce chronic stress in practice personnel should primarily address the identified workplace characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3157993069,"Abstract Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) is a pan-negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling and a tumor suppressor in several cancers, but its involvement in melanoma is largely unexplored. Here, we aim to determine the role of LRIG1 in melanoma tumorigenesis, RTK signaling, and BRAF inhibitor resistance. We find that LRIG1 is downregulated during early tumorigenesis and that LRIG1 affects activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in melanoma cells. LRIG1 -dependent regulation of EGFR signaling is evolutionary conserved to the roundworm C. elegans , where negative regulation of the EGFR-Ras-Raf pathway by sma-10 / LRIG completely depends on presence of the receptor let-23 / EGFR . In a cohort of metastatic melanoma patients, we observe an association between LRIG1 and survival in the triple wild-type subtype and in tumors with high EGFR expression. During in vitro development of BRAF inhibitor resistance, LRIG1 expression decreases; and mimics LRIG1 knockout cells for increased EGFR expression. Treating resistant cells with recombinant LRIG1 suppresses AKT activation and proliferation. Together, our results show that sma-10/LRIG is a conserved regulator of RTK signaling, add to our understanding of LRIG1 in melanoma and identifies recombinant LRIG1 as a potential therapeutic against BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma."

Fifteen field efficacy experiments were conducted from 2014 through the 2020 growing season across six different states in Brazil to evaluate performance against key lepidopteran pests through artificial infestations of Chrysodeixis includens (Walker), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith,1797), Spodoptera cosmioides (Walker, 1858) and Chloridea virescens (F., 1781), and natural infestations of Alabama argillacea (Hübner) and S. frugiperda. The impact of this Bt cotton technology on the non-target arthropod community in Brazilian cotton production systems was also assessed in a multi-site experiment. DAS-21023-5 × DAS-24236-5 × SYN-IR102-7 cotton significantly reduced the feeding damage caused by S. frugiperda, S. cosmioides, C. includens, C. virescens and A. argillacea, causing high levels of mortality (greater than 99%) to all target lepidopteran pests evaluated during vegetative and/or reproductive stages of crop development. Non-target arthropod community-level analyses confirmed no unintended effects on the arthropod groups monitored. These results demonstrate the value of transgenic Bt cotton containing event DAS-21023-5 × DAS-24236-5 × SYN-IR102-7 for consideration as part of an integrated approach for managing key lepidopteran pests in Brazilian cotton production systems."
https://openalex.org/W3159190608,"Screening for changes in pregnancy-related anxiety and depressive symptoms during pregnancy may further our understanding of the relationship between these two variables and preterm birth.To determine whether changes in pregnancy-related anxiety and depressive symptoms during pregnancy influence the risk of preterm birth among Pakistani women; explore whether perceived stress moderates or mediates this relationship, and examine the relationship between the various components of pregnancy-related anxiety and preterm birth.A prospective cohort study design was used to recruit a diverse sample of 300 low-risk pregnant women from four centers of Aga Khan Hospital for Women and Children in Karachi, Pakistan. Changes in pregnancy-related anxiety and depressive symptoms during pregnancy were tested. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine a predictive model for preterm birth. We then determined if the influence of perceived stress could moderate or mediate the effect of depressive symptoms on preterm birth.Changes in pregnancy-related anxiety (OR = 1.1, CI 0.97-1.17, p = 0.167) and depressive symptoms (OR = 0.9, CI 0.85-1.03, p = 0.179) were insignificant as predictors of preterm birth after adjusting for the effects of maternal education and family type. When perceived stress was added into the model, we found that changes in depressive symptoms became marginally significant after adjusting for covariates (OR = 0.9, CI 0.82-1.01, p = 0.082). After adjusting for the mediation effect of change in perceived stress, the effect of change in depressive symptoms on preterm birth were marginally significant after adjusting for covariates. Among six different dimensions of pregnancy-related anxiety, mother's concerns about fetal health showed a trend towards being predictive of preterm birth (OR = 1.3, CI 0.97-1.72, p = 0.078).There may be a relationship between perceived stress and antenatal depressive symptoms and preterm birth. This is the first study of its kind to be conducted in Pakistan. Further research is required to validate these results."
https://openalex.org/W3159968794,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) ranks second in the frequency of all skin cancers. The balance between keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation is disrupted in the pathological development of cSCC. DLX3 is a homeobox transcription factor which plays pivotal roles in embryonic development and epidermal homeostasis. To investigate the impact of DLX3 expression on cSCC prognosis, we carried out clinicopathologic analysis of DLX3 expression which showed statistical correlation between tumors of higher pathologic grade and levels of DLX3 protein expression. Further, Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis demonstrated that low DLX3 expression correlated with poor patient survival. To model the function of Dlx3 in skin tumorigenesis, a two-stage dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) study was performed on mice genetically depleted of Dlx3 in skin epithelium (Dlx3cKO). Dlx3cKO mice developed significantly more tumors, with more rapid tumorigenesis compared to control mice. In Dlx3cKO mice treated only with DMBA, tumors developed after ~16 weeks suggesting that loss of Dlx3 has a tumor promoting effect. Whole transcriptome analysis of tumor and skin tissue from our mouse model revealed spontaneous activation of the EGFR–ERBB2 pathway in the absence of Dlx3. Together, our findings from human and mouse model system support a tumor suppressive function for DLX3 in skin and underscore the efficacy of therapeutic approaches that target EGFR–ERBB2 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3159038067,"Cicadas tend to be affected by vicariance reflecting poor mobility of nymphs underground and weak flying ability of adults. However, modern collection records of invasive cicada, combined with records of typhoon tracks, and newly obtained phylogeographic data suggest long distance, relatively instantaneous, dispersal of some vicariantly speciated cicadas. We address the importance of this typhoon dispersal mechanism applied to representative species of east Asian endemic cicadas of Cryptotympana , Mogannia , Euterpnosia and Meimuna . We combine BEAST-dated phylogenic and haplotype network analyses, modern collection data of non-native cicadas available in reports of the Japanese insect associations, modern typhoon records by Japan Meteorological Agency, and our own Quaternary geological constriction data. In conclusion, although Ryukyu endemic cicadas were vicariantly speciated, endemic cicadas on some islands were accidentally dispersed long distances to another island possibly by typhoons, particularly those associated with super typhoons generated since 1.55 Ma."
https://openalex.org/W3158446280,"Located in the Eurasian continent's hinterland, Xinjiang is a typical arid and resource-developing region in China's northwest. Problems such as excessive resource consumption, environmental pollution, and ecological imbalance are becoming severe, which have become the bottleneck that further restricts Xinjiang's sustainable development. Due to its outstanding quantitative advantages, ecological efficiency has become a significant indicator and analytical tool for measuring the green economy and sustainable development. In this study, we analyzed ecological efficiency variation for Xinjiang's 14 prefectures between 2001 and 2015 using a super-efficient data envelopment model (DEA), Malmquist Index, and Tobit model. These analyses indicated that: (1) The overall ecological efficiency level of Xinjiang is low, and development among regions is unbalanced, out of sync, lacks sustainability. (2) From 2001 to 2015, Xinjiang's ecological efficiency showed a W-shaped rising trend and finally increased by 5.7%. It is due to the substantial improvement in environmental efficiency. (3) By analyzing the environmental efficiency and resource efficiency, 14 prefectures in Xinjiang consist of four development modes: low energy consumption and low emission, high energy consumption and low emission, low energy consumption and high emission, and high energy consumption and high emission. (4) Water resources are restricting factors of arid regions. In most prefectures, there exist excessive water resource investment, excessive COD, and NH3-N emissions. (5) By analyzing the Malmquist index, it shows that the technical progress index(TC) restricted ecological efficiency. In contrast, the technical efficiency index (EC) promoted ecological efficiency.(6)The ecological efficiency was positively correlated with the utilization of foreign capital, urbanization rate, and average education degree but negatively correlated with the marketization degree. The study has guidance and reference function for the sustainable development of Xinjiang-a vital corridor of the Silk Road Economic Belt, and also provides a reference to the research work of other arid resource-based regions."
https://openalex.org/W3159214434,"Evidence from functional neuroimaging studies support neural differences between the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) presentation types. It remains unclear if these neural deficits also manifest at the structural level. We have previously shown that the ADHD combined, and ADHD inattentive types demonstrate differences in graph properties of structural covariance suggesting an underlying difference in neuroanatomical organization. The goal of this study was to examine and validate white matter brain organization between the two subtypes using both scalar and connectivity measures of brain white matter. We used both tract-based spatial statistical (TBSS) and tractography analyses with network-based Statistics (NBS) and graph-theoretical analyses in a cohort of 35 ADHD participants (aged 8–17 years) defined using DSM-IV criteria as combined (ADHD-C) type (n = 19) or as predominantly inattentive (ADHD-I) type (n = 16), and 28 matched neurotypical controls. We performed TBSS analyses on scalar measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), radial (RD), and axial (AD) diffusivity to assess differences in WM between ADHD types and controls. NBS and graph theoretical analysis of whole brain inter-regional tractography examined connectomic differences and brain network organization, respectively. None of the scalar measures significantly differed between ADHD types or relative to controls. Similarly, there were no tractography connectivity differences between the two subtypes and relative to controls using NBS. Global and regional graph measures were also similar between the groups. A single significant finding was observed for nodal degree between the ADHD-C and controls, in the right insula (corrected p = .029). Our result of no white matter differences between the subtypes is consistent with most previous findings. These findings together might suggest that the white matter structural architecture is largely similar between the DSM-based ADHD presentations is similar to the extent of being undetectable with the current cohort size."
https://openalex.org/W3159407486,"Lipid overload is intimately connected with the change of endothelial epigenetic status which impacts cellular signaling activities and endothelial function. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and meanwhile an epigenetic modifier. However, the role of ATF4 in the angiogenesis under lipid overload is not well understood. Here, to induce lipid overload status, we employed high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model in vivo and palmitic acid (PA) to stimulate endothelial cells in vitro. Compared with mice fed with normal chow diet (NCD), HFD-induced obese mice showed angiogenic defects evidenced by decline in (1) blood flow recovery after hind limb ischemia, (2) wound healing speed after skin injury, (3) capillary density in injured tissues and matrigel plugs, and (4) endothelial sprouts of aortic ring. ATF4 deficiency aggravated above angiogenic defects in mice while ATF4 overexpression improved the blunted angiogenic response. Mechanistically, lipid overload lowered the H3K4 methylation levels at the regulatory regions of NOS3 and ERK1 genes, leading to reduced angiogenic signaling activity. Methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) is identified as a target of ATF4 and formed complex with ATF4 to direct lysine methyltransferase 2A (MLL1) to the regulatory regions of both genes for the maintenance of the H3K4 methylation level and angiogenic signaling activity. Here, we uncovered a novel metabolic-epigenetic coupling orchestrated by the ATF4-MAT2A axis for angiogenesis. The ATF4-MAT2A axis links lipid overload milieu to altered epigenetic status of relevant angiogenic signaling in endothelial cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for angiogenesis impaired by lipid overload."
https://openalex.org/W3159614340,"Background As a malignant tumor with poor prognosis, accurate and effective prediction of the prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) is crucial. Methods A total of 12,909 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program between 2004 and 2016. The sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, metastasis status, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, tumor size, regional nodes examined, regional nodes positive of each patient were recorded. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify prognostic factors with a threshold of P&lt;0.05, and a nomogram was constructed. Harrell’s concordance indexes and calibration plots were used to verify the predictive power of the model. The risk groups were also stratified by quartile of the total score. Survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Age, year of diagnosis, sex, grade, histologic, marital, TNM stage, surgery of the primary site, tumor size, regional nodes positive and regional nodes examined ratio (LNR), lymph node dissection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were identified as prognostic factors for the construction of the nomogram. The nomogram exhibited a clinical predictive ability of 0.675(95% CI, 0.669~0.681) in the internal verification. The predicted calibration curve was similar to the standard curve. Decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram had value in terms of clinical application. Besides, the nomogram was able to divide the patients into different groups according to total points. Conclusions Hence, our nomogram was highly effective in predicting overall survival in patients with PC, which may provide a reference tool for clinicians to guide individualized treatment and follow-ups for patients with PC, accurately determine the 1-,3- and 5-year overall survival of patients."

The current study investigates whether this so-called relative age effect also exists in a rather unexplored domain, namely popularity among adolescents in school classes. Whereas prior studies examined relative age related to the cut-off date at primary school entry, we also study possible relative age effects regarding the age composition within pupils’ current school class. Data are from nationally-representative surveys among 14–15 year-old pupils from the Netherlands, Sweden and England. Results indicate a statistically significant positive relation of both types of relative age with popularity status in classes. The relation of past relative age is particularly strong in England, which has a system of social promotion, whereas current relative age is strong in the Netherlands, with its system of grade retention. These findings underscore the importance of education policy."
https://openalex.org/W3157056566,"Since cervical cancer still afflicts women around the world, it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanism of cervical cancer development. Infection with HPV is essential for the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). In addition, estrogen receptor signaling is implicated in the development of cervical cancer. Previously, we have isolated human wings apart-like (WAPL), which is expected to cause chromosomal instability in the process of HPV-infected precancerous lesions to cervical cancer. However, the role of WAPL in the development of CIN is still unknown. In this study, in order to elucidate the role of WAPL in the early lesion, we established WAPL overexpressing mice (WAPL Tg mice) and HPV E6/E7 knock-in (KI) mice. WAPL Tg mice developed CIN lesion without HPV E6/E7. Interestingly, in WAPL Tg mice estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) showed reduction as compared with the wild type, but cell growth factors MYC and Cyclin D1 controlled by ESR1 expressed at high levels. These results suggested that WAPL facilitates sensitivity of ESR1 mediated by some kind of molecule, and as a result, affects the expression of MYC and Cyclin D1 in cervical cancer cells. To detect such molecules, we performed microarray analysis of the uterine cervix in WAPL Tg mice, and focused MACROD1, a co-activator of ESR1. MACROD1 expression was increased in WAPL Tg mice compared with the wild type. In addition, knockdown of WAPL induced the downregulation of MACROD1, MYC, and Cyclin D1 but not ESR1 expression. Furthermore, ESR1 sensitivity assay showed lower activity in WAPL or MACROD1 downregulated cells than control cells. These data suggested that WAPL increases ESR1 sensitivity by activating MACROD1, and induces the expression of MYC and Cyclin D1. Therefore, we concluded that WAPL not only induces chromosomal instability in cervical cancer tumorigenesis, but also plays a key role in activating estrogen receptor signaling in early tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3157926345,"Treatment for the lethal primary adult brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) includes the chemotherapy temozolomide (TMZ), but TMZ resistance is common and correlates with promoter methylation of the DNA repair enzyme O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). To improve treatment of GBMs, including those resistant to TMZ, we explored the potential of targeting dopamine receptor signaling. We found that dopamine receptor 3 (DRD3) is expressed in GBM and is also a previously unexplored target for therapy. We identified novel antagonists of DRD3 that decreased the growth of GBM xenograft-derived neurosphere cultures with minimal toxicity against human astrocytes and/or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Among a set of DRD3 antagonists, we identified two compounds, SRI-21979 and SRI-30052, that were brain penetrant and displayed a favorable therapeutic window analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data demonstrated that higher levels of DRD3 (but not DRD2 or DRD4) were associated with worse prognosis in primary, MGMT unmethylated tumors. These data suggested that DRD3 antagonists may remain efficacious in TMZ-resistant GBMs. Indeed, SRI-21979, but not haloperidol, significantly reduced the growth of TMZ-resistant GBM cells. Together our data suggest that DRD3 antagonist-based therapies may provide a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of GBM."
https://openalex.org/W3157940505,"In this work, we develop a novel method that bridges between material properties of proteins, particularly the modulus of elasticity, and the underlying molecular interactions. To this end, we employ both an all-atom normal mode analysis (NMA) model with the CHARMM force field and an elastic solid model for proteins and protein interfaces. And the “bridge” between the two models is a common physical property predictable by both models: the magnitude of thermal vibrations. This connection allows one to calibrate the Young’s moduli of proteins and protein interface regions. We find that the Young’s moduli of proteins are in the range of a few Gpa to 10 Gpa, while the Young’s moduli of the interface regions are several times smaller. The work is significant as it represents the first attempt to systematically compute the elastic moduli of proteins from molecular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3159678882,"SPATS1 (spermatogenesis-associated, serine-rich 1) is an evolutionarily conserved, testis-specific protein that is differentially expressed during rat male meiotic prophase. Some reports have suggested a link between SPATS1 underexpression/mutation and human pathologies such as male infertility and testicular cancer. Given the absence of functional studies, we generated a Spats1 loss-of-function mouse model using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The phenotypic analysis showed no overt phenotype in Spats1-/- mice, with both males and females being fertile. Flow cytometry and histological analyses did not show differences in the testicular content and histology between WT and knockout mice. Moreover, no significant differences in sperm concentration, motility, and morphology, were observed between WT and KO mice. These results were obtained both for young adults and for aged animals. Besides, although an involvement of SPATS1 in the Wnt signaling pathway has been suggested, we did not detect changes in the expression levels of typical Wnt pathway-target genes in mutant individuals. Thus, albeit Spats1 alteration might be a risk factor for male testicular health, we hereby show that this gene is not individually essential for male fertility and spermatogenesis in mouse."

https://openalex.org/W3157765703,"Background This study aimed to determine the within-person and between-persons associations of low-grade inflammation (LGI) and endothelial dysfunction (ED) with echocardiographic measures related to diastolic dysfunction (DD) in two general populations and whether these associations differed by sex. Methods Biomarkers and echocardiographic measures were measured at both baseline and follow-up in the Hoorn Study (n = 383) and FLEMENGHO (n = 491). Individual biomarker levels were combined into either a Z-score of LGI (CRP, SAA, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and sICAM-1) or ED (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sE-selectin and sTM). Mixed models were used to determine within-person and between-persons associations of biomarker Z-scores with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left atrial volume index (LAVI). These associations were adjusted for a-priori selected confounders. Results Overall Z-scores for LGI or ED were not associated with echocardiographic measures. Effect modification by sex was apparent for ED with LVEF in both cohorts (P-for interaction = 0.08 and 0.06), but stratified results were not consistent. Effect modification by sex was apparent for TNF-α in the Hoorn Study and E-selectin in FLEMENGHO with LVEF (P-for interaction≤0.05). In the Hoorn Study, women whose TNF-α levels increased with 1-SD over time had a decrease in LVEF of 2.2 (-4.5;0.01) %. In FLEMENGHO, men whose E-selectin levels increased with 1-SD over time had a decrease in LVEF of 1.6 (-2.7;-0.5) %. Conclusion Our study did not show consistent associations of LGI and ED with echocardiographic measures. Some evidence of effect modification by sex was present for ED and specific biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W3157866734,"Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a key enzyme of the trans-sulfuration pathway that converts homocysteine to cystathionine. Loss of CBS activity due to mutation results in CBS deficiency, an inborn error of metabolism characterized by extreme elevation of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy). C57BL6 mice containing either a homozygous null mutation in the cystathionine β-synthase (Cbs-/- ) gene or an inactive human CBS protein (Tg-G307S Cbs-/- ) are born in mendelian numbers, but the vast majority die between 18 and 21 days of age due to liver failure. However, adult Cbs null mice that express a hypomorphic allele of human CBS as a transgene (Tg-I278T Cbs-/- ) show almost no neonatal lethality despite having serum tHcy levels similar to mice with no CBS activity. Here, we characterize liver and serum metabolites in neonatal Cbs+/- , Tg-G307S Cbs-/- , and Tg-I278T Cbs-/- mice at 6, 10, and 17 days of age to understand this difference. In serum, we observe similar elevations in tHcy in both Tg-G307S Cbs-/- and Tg-I278T Cbs-/- compared to control animals, but methionine is much more severely elevated in Tg-G307S Cbs-/- mice. Large scale metabolomic analysis of liver tissue confirms that both methionine and methionine-sulfoxide are significantly more elevated in Tg-G307S Cbs-/- animals, along with significant differences in several other metabolites including hexoses, amino acids, other amines, lipids, and carboxylic acids. Our data are consistent with a model that the neonatal lethality observed in CBS-null mice is driven by excess methionine resulting in increased stress on a variety of related pathways including the urea cycle, TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis, and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3158026635,"Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the major cause of death in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction reflects LV pressure overload and is common in patients with ESKD. Recently, there have been studies on the usefulness of central blood pressure (BP); however, the relationship between central BP and LV diastolic dysfunction is not clear in dialysis patients with preserved systolic function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical implication of central BP on LV diastolic dysfunction and CV mortality in the ESKD patients with preserved LV systolic function.This prospective observational cohort study investigated the effect of LV diastolic dysfunction on CV mortality in the ESKD patients with preserved systolic function using echocardiography. Vascular calcification was evaluated using the abdominal aortic calcification score, and aortic stiffness was determined by measuring pulse wave velocity (PWV). The predictors of CV mortality were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard analysis.The subjects were comprised of 61 patients, with an average age of 54 years, 20 males (32.8%), and 25 diabetics (41.0%). There were 39 patients on hemodialysis and 22 patients receiving peritoneal dialysis treatment. During the mean follow-up period of 79.3 months, 16 patients (26.2%) died, and 7 patients (11.4%) died of CV events. The central systolic BP and diabetes were independent risk factors for LV diastolic dysfunction. In addition, patients with LV diastolic dysfunction had an increased CV mortality. When left atrial volume index and PWV were adjusted, the E/E' ratio was found to be a predictor of CV mortality.Central systolic BP and diabetes were found to be significant risk factors for LV diastolic dysfunction. LV diastolic dysfunction can independently predict CV mortality in dialysis patients with preserved LV systolic function."
https://openalex.org/W3158231059,"One of the main challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic is the lack of safety measures and guidelines to reduce the risk of viral spread among people during gatherings. This study was conducted to evaluate the distance of oral and nasal droplet spread in a model that simulates coughing and sneezing in a public setting, specifically a school setting, to guide faculty and staff members with safety measures and guidelines to reduce droplet spread. Several models were prepared to observe and visualize the spread of fluid simulating respiratory droplets in places such as the classroom and the cafeteria, in which a student would be more susceptible to contract a virus since individuals cannot wear masks while eating. For all trials, a 2.54 centimeter balloon with 0.3 milliliters of diluted fluorescent paint was placed inside a mannequin head and was exploded outwards from the mannequin’s mouth at 5 pounds per square inch (psi). Using a black light, the expelled fluorescent macroscopic droplets were visualized. When applying safety precautions and guidelines such as mandating face masks, the results of the experiments conducted in this study with a surgical mask, were extremely positive. However, without other safety precautions such as face masks and barriers, social distancing proved to be ineffective. In conclusion the most effective way to prevent droplet spread during activities where masks simply cannot be worn, such as eating, is to apply barriers between the individuals. Applying barriers and wearing masks successfully prevented macroscopic droplet spread."
https://openalex.org/W3158441941,"Molecular changes, caused by various environmental factors, affect the quality and developmental potential of oocytes. Oxidative stress (OS) is a major factor involved in various gynecologic disorders and/or in aging. Recent studies suggest that elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) hamper oocyte quality and future embryonic development. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a pleiotropic protein, known for its antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties. Our previous findings demonstrate the antioxidative role of rPEDF in maintaining granulosa cell viability. In the current study, we examined the ability of PEDF to negate the adverse impact of OS on oocytes. Maturation rate of oocytes exposed to OS was significantly lower than that of control oocytes. The number of mtDNA copies in OS-exposed oocytes was significantly higher than in control oocytes (>3 times), whereas ATP concentration was significantly lower. Oocytes exposed to OS demonstrated impaired chromosome arrangement at the metaphase plate. PEDF significantly improved maturation rate of untreated OS-exposed oocytes. Moreover, mtDNA copy number, ATP concentration, and chromosome arrangement at the metaphase plate in rPEDF-treated OS-exposed oocytes were restored to the level of control oocytes. Our findings demonstrate that OS hampers the ability of oocytes to undergo proper in vitro maturation. The energetic balance of OS-exposed oocyte is characterized by excessive mtDNA replication and reduced ATP concentration; it hampers the ability of oocytes to perform high fidelity chromosome segregation. PEDF alleviates this damage, improves the rate of oocyte maturation, and preserves mtDNA level and ATP content, thus enabling oocytes to form proper metaphase plate and improve oocyte competence."

Predictive errors calculated using four different formulae (Haigis, SRKT, Holladay1, Barrett Universal II) were compared at 1 month after cataract surgery.The mean preoperative axial length (AL) showed no statistically significant difference between SS-OCT and PCI (SS-OCT: 23.78 ± 0.12 mm and PCI: 23.77 ± 0.12 mm). The mean anterior chamber depth (ACD) was 3.30 ± 0.04 mm for SS-OCT and 3.23 ± 0.04 mm for PCI, which was significantly different between the two techniques. The mean corneal curvature also differed significantly between the two techniques. The difference in mean arithmetic prediction error was significant in the Haigis, SRKT, and Holladay1 formulae. The difference in mean absolute prediction error was significant in all four formulae.SS-OCT and PCI demonstrated good agreement on biometric measurements; however, there were significant differences in some biometric values. These differences in some ocular biometrics can cause a difference in refractive error after cataract surgery. New type SS-OCT was not superior to the IOL power prediction calculated by PCI."
https://openalex.org/W3158530266,"Biotites occur with varying degrees of alteration within a granite. This study analyzes the relationships among alteration indicators, areal microvoid fractions in chloritized biotite, and macroscopic fracture frequencies in the Toki granite, central Japan, to establish the genesis and development processes of fractures in granite. Appropriate characterizations for the frequency distribution of macroscopic fractures in granite can assist in understanding potential hydrogeological applications, which contributes to safety evaluations for geological disposal and storage. Borehole 06MI03, drilled to a depth of 191 m, was used to obtain samples for the analysis. In total, 24 samples that depicted variations in the macroscopic fracture frequency were selected. Petrographic alteration indicators using biotite chloritization as innovative methods are proposed to evaluate the extent of hydrothermal alteration and fracture frequency within granites. The alteration indicators are defined as the ratio between the alteration product area and the original mineral area. Furthermore, the volume of microscopic fractures and micropores in the mineral was quantitatively characterized by the areal fraction of microvoids in minerals through image analysis. Samples with high macroscopic fracture frequencies correspond to a high number of areal microvoid fractions and large alteration indicators. Microvoids, which are the source of macroscopic fractures, occurred at temperatures between 350 and 780°C and can be evaluated by intrinsic factors, such as alteration indicators. Subsequent faulting and unloading (extrinsic factors) developed microvoids into macroscopic fractures. Intrinsic factors are used to evaluate the source of macroscopic fractures, and therefore contribute to the characterization of present and future distributions of macroscopic fracture frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W3158774951,"Purpose Three related male English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) were reported to be congenitally blind. Examination of one of these revealed complete retinal detachment. A presumptive diagnosis of retinal dysplasia (RD) was provided and pedigree analysis was suggestive of an X-linked mode of inheritance. We sought to investigate the genetic basis of RD in this family of ECS. Methods Following whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the one remaining male RD-affected ECS, two distinct investigative approaches were employed: a candidate gene approach and a whole genome approach. In the candidate gene approach, COL9A2 , COL9A3 , NHEJ1 , RS1 and NDP genes were investigated based on their known associations with RD and retinal detachment in dogs and humans. In the whole genome approach, affected WGS was compared with 814 unaffected canids to identify candidate variants, which were filtered based on appropriate segregation and predicted pathogenic effects followed by subsequent investigation of gene function. Candidate variants were tested for appropriate segregation in the ECS family and association with disease was assessed using samples from a total of 180 ECS. Results The same variant in NDP (c.653_654insC, p.Met114Hisfs*16) that was predicted to result in 15 aberrant amino acids before a premature stop in norrin protein, was identified independently by both approaches and was shown to segregate appropriately within the ECS family. Association of this variant with X-linked RD was significant (P = 0.0056). Conclusions For the first time, we report a variant associated with canine X-linked RD. NDP variants are already known to cause X-linked RD, along with other abnormalities, in human Norrie disease. Thus, the dog may serve as a useful large animal model for research."
https://openalex.org/W3157086801,"The current study examined how emotional faces impact on attentional control at both involuntary and voluntary levels in children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A non-face single target was either presented in isolation or synchronously with emotional face distractors namely angry, happy and neutral faces. ASD and typically developing children made more erroneous saccades towards emotional distractors relative to neutral distractors in parafoveal and peripheral conditions. Remote distractor effects were observed on saccade latency in both groups regardless of distractor type, whereby time taken to initiate an eye movement to the target was longest in central distractor conditions, followed by parafoveal and peripheral distractor conditions. The remote distractor effect was greater for angry faces compared to happy faces in the ASD group. Proportions of failed disengagement trials from central distractors, for the first saccade, were higher in the angry distractor condition compared with the other two distractor conditions in ASD, and this effect was absent for the typical group. Eye movement results suggest difficulties in disengaging from fixated angry faces in ASD. Atypical disengagement from angry faces at the voluntary level could have consequences for the development of higher-level socio-communicative skills in ASD."

The mismatch between the ability to generate large data sets and the computing skill to analyze them is arguably the most striking within the life sciences. The Digital Image and Vision Applications in Science (DIVAS) project describes a scaffolded series of interventions implemented over the span of a year to build the coding and computing skill of undergraduate students majoring primarily in the natural sciences. The program is designed as a community of practice, providing support within a network of learners. The program focus, images as data, provides a compelling ‘hook’ for participating scholars. Scholars begin the program with a one-credit spring semester seminar where they are exposed to image analysis. The program continues in the summer with a one-week, intensive Python and image processing workshop. From there, scholars tackle image analysis problems using a pair programming approach and can finish the summer with independent research. Finally, scholars participate in a follow-up seminar the subsequent spring and help onramp the next cohort of incoming scholars. We observed promising growth in participant self-efficacy in computing that was maintained throughout the project as well as significant growth in key computational skills. DIVAS program funding was able to support seventeen DIVAS over three years, with 76% of DIVAS scholars identifying as women and 14% of scholars identifying as members of an underrepresented minority group. Most scholars (82%) entered the program as first year students, with 94% of DIVAS scholars retained for the duration of the program and 100% of scholars remaining a STEM major one year after completing the program. The outcomes of the DIVAS project support the efficacy of building computational skill through repeated exposure of scholars to relevant applications over an extended period within a community of practice."
https://openalex.org/W3157067695,"The embedding of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms has become a foundation for many downstream bioinformatics tasks. Recent studies employ different data sources, such as the corpus (in which each document is indexed by a set of MeSH terms), the MeSH term ontology, and the semantic predications between MeSH terms (extracted by SemMedDB), to learn their embeddings. While these data sources contribute to learning the MeSH term embeddings, current approaches fail to incorporate all of them in the learning process. The challenge is that the structured relationships between MeSH terms are different across the data sources, and there is no approach to fusing such complex data into the MeSH term embedding learning. In this paper, we study the problem of incorporating corpus, ontology, and semantic predications to learn the embeddings of MeSH terms. We propose a novel framework, Corpus, Ontology, and Semantic predications-based MeSH term embedding (COS), to generate high-quality MeSH term embeddings. COS converts the corpus, ontology, and semantic predications into MeSH term sequences, merges these sequences, and learns MeSH term embeddings using the sequences. Extensive experiments on different datasets show that COS outperforms various baseline embeddings and traditional non-embedding-based baselines."

Vultures exposed to diclofenac soon become depressed and die with signs of severe visceral gout and renal damage on necropsy. The molecular mechanism behind toxicity and renal excretion of uric acid is still poorly understood. With the clinical pictures suggesting renal uric acid excretion as the target site for toxicity, as a first step the following study was undertaken to determine the uric acid excretory pathways present in the African white-backed vulture ( Gyps africanus ) (AWB), one of the species susceptible to toxicity. Using transcriptome analysis, immunohistochemistry and functional predictions, we demonstrated that AWB makes use of the organic anion transporter 2 ( OAT2 ) for their uric acid excretion. RT-qPCR analysis subsequently demonstrated relatively similar expression of the OAT2 transporter in the vulture and chicken. Lastly docking analysis, predicted that the non-steroidal drugs induce their toxicity through an allosteric binding."
https://openalex.org/W3159291840,"Variegated limestones, a transitional series between red, Upper Jurassic radiolarite and whitish, Lower Cretaceous Maiolica limestone in the Pieniny Klippen Belt deposits in the Polish part of the Western Carpathians, have yielded rich microfossil assemblages with common calcareous dinoflagellate resting stages, hereafter, dinocysts. We found an undescribed dinocyst species in red-greenish limestone of a deep water, pelagic habitat in the Branisko succession of the Pieniny Klippen Basin and named it Cadosinopsis rehakovii sp. nov. The new species has a spherical to oval calcareous test ranging from 34 to 59 μm in length and 30 to 50 μm in width, with two layered wall. The inner layer is built of coarse–thick, plate-shaped calcite crystals and is white in transmitted light. The outer layer is built of fibrous crystals, vitreous (transparent) in transmitted light. The aperture is wide and seen only in the inner layer. We compared the detailed morphological characteristics of the new species with another species from the same genus in the Jurassic and Cretaceous Tethyan deposits. Specimens have been measured, grouped and interpreted using cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical variate analysis (CVA). Among them, the new species shows a resemblance in cross-section to other species of Cadosinopsis , C . nowaki Borza, 1984, and C . andrusovi Scheibner 1967, previously described in literature. However, the two species are easily distinguishable by some features. Cadosinopsis . nowaki is bigger in size (length from 50 to76 μm and width from 43 to 67 μm), its inner layer is thicker and consists of vitreous-sparite calcite, and it has less centrically located chamber. C . andrusovi is much bigger in size as its length ranges from 68 to 108 μm and width ranges from 60 to 80 μm, and the cyst is more oval and its chamber less spherical. The new species is the third Cadosinopsis species described in the Tethyan realm and about two hundred and sixty-first fossil species (morphotype) described in the world so far."
