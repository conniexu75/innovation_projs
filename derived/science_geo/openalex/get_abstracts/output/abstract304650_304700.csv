https://openalex.org/W2066579884,"An analysis of growing season data from 17 lakes throughout the world suggests that the relative proportion of blue-green algae (Cyanophyta) in the epilimnetic phytoplankton is dependent on the epilimnetic ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus. Blue-green algae tended to be rare when this ratio exceeded 29 to 1 by weight, suggesting that modification of this ratio by control of nutrient additions may provide a means by which lake water quality can be managed."
https://openalex.org/W1972389626,"The extracellular fluid of ligninolytic cultures of the wood-decomposing basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds. contains an enzyme that degrades lignin substructure model compounds as well as spruce and birch lignins. It has a molecular size of 42,000 daltons and requires hydrogen peroxide for activity."
https://openalex.org/W2024430005,"Significant abundances of trapped argon, krypton, and xenon have been measured in shock-altered phases of the achondritic meteorite Elephant Moraine 79001 from Antarctica. The relative elemental abundances, the high ratios of argon-40 to argon-36 (>/= 2000), and the high ratios of xenon-129 to xenon-132 (>/= 2.0) of the trapped gas more closely resemble Viking data for the martian atmosphere than data for noble gas components typically found in meteorites. These findings support earlier suggestions, made on the basis of geochemical evidence, that shergottites and related rare meteorites may have originated from the planet Mars."

https://openalex.org/W2080403383,"The sequence of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from the archaebacterium Halobacterium volcanii has been determined by DNA sequencing methods. The archaebacterial rRNA is similar to its eubacterial counterpart in secondary structure. Although it is closer in sequence to the eubacterial 16S rRNA than to the eukaryotic 16S-like rRNA, the H. volcanii sequence also shows certain points of specific similarity to its eukaryotic counterpart. Since the H. volcanii sequence is closer to both the eubacterial and the eukaryotic sequences than these two are to one another, it follows that the archaebacterial sequence resembles their common ancestral sequence more closely than does either of the other two versions."
https://openalex.org/W2064941535,"An assemblage of Middle Cambrian Atlantic faunal province trilobites has been found in the rocks of the Carolina slate belt near Batesburg, South Carolina. Geologic and paleomagnetic data suggest that the Carolina slate belt and the adjacent Charlotte belt constitute an exotic terrane that was accreted to North America in early to middle Paleozoic time."
https://openalex.org/W2017534600,Tobermorites have cation-exchange and selectivity properties intermediate between those of clay minerals and zeolites. Aluminum-substituted tobermorites in particular show high selectivity for cesium. This new group of cation exchangers may find applications in catalysis and in nuclear and hazardous waste disposal.
https://openalex.org/W2072559347,Individuals who received documents through a selective dissemination of information system were asked to determine the relevance of documents to their work interests on the basis of titles and of abstracts. The results indicate that there was no significant difference between the usefulness of titles and of abstracts for this purpose.

https://openalex.org/W2087417626,"The stability of plankton in the York River, Virginia, during the summer of 1960 is computed by a derived empirical stability measure. The communities were indicated to have considerable homeostasis, being over five times more stable than the physical biotope."

https://openalex.org/W2035717894,"Unlike maize plants heterozygous the abnormal chromosome 10 (K10) and the normal chromosome 10 (k10), those heterozygous for a knobbed chromosome 10 (K(T)10/k10) do not undergo preferential segregation or ""meiotic drive."" Ting's chromosome 10, however, does show neocentric activity, although the extent of this is not as pronounced as is the case in K10 homozygotes. The K(T)10 chromosome is considerably shorter than and is cytologically distinguishable from the K10 and the k10 chromosomes."
