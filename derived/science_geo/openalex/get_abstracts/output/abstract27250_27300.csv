https://openalex.org/W2081501399,"The proximal region of the ovalbumin gene promoter contains a half-palindromic estrogen-responsive element (ERE) that mediates cell-specific trans-activation by the estrogen receptor (ER). We show that the ovalbumin ERE binds a ubiquitous nucleoprotein complex containing oncoproteins c-Fos and c-Jun. Mutations altering the estrogen inducibility of the promoter prevent the complex formation, which is, however, found in the presence and absence of ER and estradiol. Mutagenesis indicates that the sequence 5'-TGGGTCA-3', containing the half-palindromic ERE, is responsible for induction by phorbol esters of the ovalbumin promoter and is a target for c-fos and c-jun trans-activation. Transfection experiments reveal that c-fos, c-jun, and ER coactivate the ovalbumin promoter. Direct ER interaction with the target sequence is not required, since an ER deleted for its DNA binding domain is functional in the coactivation with c-fos and c-jun. Our data indicate a convergence of hormonal induction and activation of signal transduction pathways at the transcriptional level."

https://openalex.org/W1627252162,"The mitogenic activity of membrane-associated tyrosine kinases such as Src and the PDGF receptor appear to depend on Ras function. Ras biochemical activity involves regulation of a GTP/GDP cycle and the GTPase activating protein (GAP). Recently, PDGF and v-Src have been shown to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP, linking these pathways at the biochemical level. To test whether PDGF and v-Src affect the Ras GTP/GDP cycle, we have measured the guanine nucleotides complexed to Ras in NIH3T3 cells and compared the ratio of GTP to total GTP + GDP detected (percent GTP). In normal quiescent NIH3T3 cells, PDGF stimulated the basal amount of GTP complexed to Ras (7%) by 2.1-fold to 15%. The effect was dependent on PDGF concentration and was observed maximally within 10 min following PDGF challenge. Ras was complexed to 22% GTP in NIH3T3 cells transformed by v-src or v-abl. Overexpression of GAP by 110-fold in NIH3T3 cells reduced the basal level of GTP complexed to Ras to 2.4%; upon challenge with PDGF, Ras was complexed to 6.6% GTP. These results indicate that PDGF receptor activation and tyrosine kinase-encoding oncogene products can stimulate Ras into the GTP complex and that GAP in intact mammalian cells can decrease the amount of GTP complexed to Ras."
https://openalex.org/W1568036284,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) was incubated with cells and extracts analyzed for processed fragments. PE was proteolytically cleaved to produce a N-terminal 28-kDa and a C-terminal 37-kDa fragment, the latter being composed of a portion of domain II and all of domain III (the ADP-ribosylating domain). Cleavage was evident at 10 min after toxin addition and endosome preparations contained the processed fragments. Initially, the two fragments were linked by a disulfide bond. Subsequently, the 37-kDa fragment was reduced and translocated to the cytosol where it inactivated protein synthesis. Cytosol from toxin-treated cells was greatly enriched in the 37-kDa fragment. The 37-kDa fragment appears to be essential for toxicity since mutant PE molecules that do not produce this fragment, or cannot deliver it to the cytosol, fail to kill cells."
https://openalex.org/W1679032940,"The recognition of double-stranded DNA breaks and single-stranded nicks by human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and the consequent enzymic activation were examined using derivatives of the enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli. The N-terminal 162 residues encompass two zinc fingers. Deletion or mutation of the first finger results in a loss of activation by DNA with either single-stranded or double-stranded damage. Destruction of the second finger reduces activation by double-stranded DNA breaks only slightly, but eliminates activation by single-stranded DNA nicks. These data suggest that activation by single-stranded DNA nicks requires two zinc fingers, but activation by double-stranded DNA breaks requires only the finger closer to the N terminus. Variant proteins that lack both zinc fingers are enzymically inactive but still exhibit weak DNA binding, which is independent of DNA damage. Thus, other regions are also capable of binding intact DNA, but the recognition of a strand nick or break which occasions the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) specifically requires the zinc fingers."
https://openalex.org/W1996286867,"Efficient transport of class I major histocompatibility complex molecules to the cell surface requires association of the class I heavy chain with endogenous peptide and the class I light chain, β2-microglobulin (β2M). A mutant cell line deficient in β2M transports low amounts of nonpeptide-associated heavy chains to the cell surface that can associate with exogenously provided β2M and synthetic peptide antigens. Normal β2M-sufficient cells grown in serum-free media devoid of β2M also require an exogenous source of β2M to efficiently bind synthetic peptide. Thus, class I molecules on normal cells do not spontaneously bind or exchange peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1487157100,"In a previous report (Macedo, D.V., Ferraz, V. L., Pereira-da-Silva, L., and Vercesi, A. E. (1988) in Integration of Mitochondrial Functions (Lemasters, J. J., et al., eds) pp. 535-542, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York), we proposed that the alterations in the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability caused by Ca2+ plus prooxidants could be the consequence of membrane protein sulfhydryl-disulfide transitions. In this study, we show that Ca2+ plus diamide, a thiol oxidant, significantly decrease the ability of beef heart submitochondrial particles to build up and sustain a membrane potential generated by succinate oxidation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized membrane proteins indicates that these effects on the membrane potential are associated with the production of protein aggregates due to thiol cross-linking. Evidence is also presented that these protein aggregates can be produced in mitoplasts previously loaded with Ca2+ and that this is potentiated by the presence of either diamide or t-butylhydroperoxide. Furthermore, dithiothreitol, a disulfide reductant, was found to be much more effective than NAD(P)+ reductants in reversing Ca2+ efflux induced by prooxidants. It is concluded that the perturbation of the inner mitochondrial membrane caused by Ca2+ plus prooxidants is associated with protein polymerization due to thiol cross-linking, resulting in the production of high molecular mass protein aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1503830583,"We prepared a spherical reconstituted high density lipoprotein (rHDL) particle in pure form and compared it with its homogeneous discoidal rHDL precursors, in terms of the structure and stability of the apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) component, the dynamics of the surface lipids, and the relative reactivity with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. The apoA-I-structure was examined in the rHDL particles by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopic methods, and the binding of monoclonal antibodies specific for apoA-I epitopes. The stability of apoA-I on the rHDL particles was assessed by the effects of guanidine hydrochloride on the wavelength of maximum intrinsic fluorescence of the apolipoprotein. Lipid dynamics in the acyl chain region and the polarity of the lipid-water interface were investigated by means of fluorescence probes. The conformation of apoA-I in the spherical 93-A rHDL particles was found to be very similar to that in the 96-A rHDL discs but distinct from the apoA-I structure in the 78-A rHDL discs. The stability of apoA-I to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride was highest in the 93-A rHDL spheres. The experiments on the lipids indicate somewhat more ordered and motionally restricted acyl chains in the spheres, relative to the discs, but a similar surface polarity. These results suggest that the folding and organization of apoA-I on the three particles include protein domains consisting of interacting alpha-helical segments in the carboxyl-terminal region and a globular domain in the amino-terminal region of each apoA-I molecule. The reactivity with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase was highest for the 96-A rHDL disc, and 16- and 34-fold lower for the 78-A rHDL disc and the 93-A rHDL sphere, respectively, possibly as a result of differences in apoA-I structure and product inhibition in these particles."
https://openalex.org/W2007038051,"Drosophila determines its sex by ""counting"" X chromosomes. We show that premature expression of the pair-rule segmentation gene hairy interferes with this process, resulting in female-specific lethality by inhibiting initiation of the master control gene Sex-lethal (Sxl). The female-specific lethality can be suppressed by a constitutive Sxl allele or by extra copies of X-linked ""counting elements."" These results are best explained by competition between hairy and other helix-loop-helix transcription factors that act in chromosome counting. We have confirmed this model by showing that misexpression of the achaete-scute T4 gene induces ectopic Sxl expression and male-specific lethality, confirming that achaete-scute T4 is the sisterless-b counting element. We propose that X chromosomes are counted through heterodimers of helix-loop-helix transcription factors that act synergistically to initiate Sxl expression."
https://openalex.org/W1938146920,"Immediate-early genes, whose expression increases independent of de novo protein synthesis during the transition from quiescence to proliferation, are postulated to play important regulatory roles in the growth response. The complement of immediate-early genes expressed must depend on the milieu of preexisting transcription factors in the quiescent cell as well as the type of mitogenic stimulation and, thus, may differ between cell types. We have begun characterizing the immediate-early response in regenerating liver and insulin-stimulated Reuber H-35 hepatoma cells in comparison with previously published results from mitogen-stimulated Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts. The proliferating H-35 and regenerating liver cells maintain their similarity to quiescent liver as demonstrated by their continued production of the liver-specific albumin, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase messenger RNAs (mRNA). Surprisingly, the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene, which undergoes down-regulation in insulin-treated H-35 cells, was cloned by differential screening of a subtraction-enriched regenerating liver cDNA library and is an immediate-early gene in regenerating liver. H-35 cells treated with either insulin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate express elevated levels of the jun genes, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate pretreatment fails to abolish the insulin response, indicating that it does not depend on protein kinase C. jun family gene expression in regenerating liver differs from that in mitogen-treated fibroblasts in that the time course of expression of c-jun and junB is prolonged, and junD mRNA levels distinctly increase. Additionally, although c-fos and egr-1 mRNAs are expressed at elevated levels in stimulated liver cells, fos-B, fra-1, and egr-2 are not, which suggests that factors in addition to the serum response factor participate in the regulation of immediate-early gene induction. Interestingly, gene 33, which was cloned from a regenerating liver cDNA library by differential screening and lacks a recognizable serum response element, functions as an immediate-early gene in regenerating liver and in mitogen-treated H-35 and Balb/c 3T3 cells. These results suggest that gene 33 participates in the transition from quiescence to proliferation in many mitogen-treated cells in addition to its previously reported involvement in hormone responses. Overall, the results presented here suggest that the immediate-early response varies considerably between regenerating liver and mitogen-stimulated fibroblasts and could involve multiple, preexisting, tissue-specific, transcription-activating proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1551944091,"In ovarian antral follicles cumulus cells (approximately 1,000/follicle) closely surround the oocyte, and mural granulosa cells (approximately 50,000/follicle) are distributed at the periphery. Previous work (Salustri, A., Yanagishita, M., and Hascall, V. C. (1990) Dev. Biol. 138, 26-32) showed that oocytes produce a factor(s) which stimulates hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis by cumulus cells during expansion of the cumulus cell-oocyte complex. We now show that mural granulosa cells also respond in vitro to the oocyte factor(s) with greatly increased HA synthesis. As with cumulus cells, a factor(s) present in fetal calf serum is required to retain newly synthesized HA in the extracellular matrix. Unlike cumulus cells, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is not required for maximal stimulation, in part because mural granulosa cells synthesize prostaglandin E2 which can substitute for FSH in promoting cumulus cell-oocyte complex expansion. Of several growth factors studied, only transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) stimulated HA synthesis in both cell types. However, the stimulation of HA synthesis by TGF-beta 1 was additive with that for the oocyte factor(s), and neutralizing antibodies to TGF-beta did not inhibit the response to the oocyte factor(s). The results indicate that the oocyte factor(s) and TGF-beta 1 are not the same and that they operate through different receptors in stimulating HA synthesis. Epidermal growth factor was able to replace FSH in amplifying the response of cumulus cells to the oocyte factor(s) and in stimulating synthesis of dermatan sulfate proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1620884108,"High levels of acetylation of lysines in the amino-terminal domains of all four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, have been shown to reduce the linking number change per nucleosome core particle in reconstituted minichromosomes (Norton, V. G., Imai, B. S., Yau, P., and Bradbury, E. M. (1989) Cell 57, 449-457). Because there is evidence to suggest that the acetylations of H3 and H4 have functions that are distinct from those of H2A and H2B, we have determined the nucleosome core particle linking number change in minichromosomes containing fully acetylated H3 and H4 and very low levels of acetylation in H2A and H2B. This linking number change was -0.81 +/- 0.05, in close agreement with the linking number change for hyperacetylated nucleosome core particles which contain high levels of acetylation in all four core histones (approximately 70% of full acetylation in H3 and H4). Therefore, high levels of acetylation of H3 and H4 alone are responsible for the reduction in the linking number change per nucleosome core particle."
https://openalex.org/W1539499395,"In the neurosecretory cell line PC12 the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, and membrane potential were affected by both external ATP and the nonapeptide bradykinin, BK. The latter caused a rapid and large release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Ca2+ redistribution) and, in the presence of external Ca2+, a long lasting, but moderate Ca2+ influx, which was insensitive to dihydropyridine blockers. On the contrary, ATP evoked a [Ca2+]i rise which rapidly inactivated. At least three different mechanisms accounted for the ATP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i: less than 20% of the total response was due to intracellular Ca2+ redistribution, consistent with a small increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate level; the rest (over 80%) was equally accounted for by ATP-activated cation channels and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. ATP and BK (the latter after K+ channel blockade) caused plasma membrane depolarization. With both agonists the inward current was carried by both Na+ and Ca2+, although the BK-activated current appeared to be more selective for Ca2+. Channels triggered by ATP and BK differed not only in their cation selectivity, but also in modulation by both [Ca2+]i and drugs such as the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the new antagonist of ligand-activated Ca2+ influx, SK&F 96365."
https://openalex.org/W1571732908,"Greater than 85% of the transport-impaired PiZ variant of human alpha 1-antitrypsin is retained within cells and subsequently degraded within a pre-Golgi nonlysosomal compartment that is apparently separate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Le, A., Graham, K. S., and Sifers, R. N. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14001-14007). Despite this phenomenon, human patients and PiZ-bearing transgenic mice exhibit an accumulation of the undegraded protein as insoluble aggregates within distended cisternae of the hepatic ER (Carlson, J. A., Rogers, B. B., Sifers, R. N., Finegold, M. J., Clift, S. M., DeMayo, F. J., Bullock, D. W., and Woo, S. L. C. (1989) J. Clin. Invest. 83, 1183-1190). Immunoprecipitation of the PiZ variant from pulse-radiolabeled hepatocytes from the transgenic animals has demonstrated that a minute quantity of the newly synthesized mutant protein is apparently resistant to degradation and accumulates gradually within the particulate fraction of the cell. Although the steady-state level of the resident ER protein grp78/BiP is elevated in response to the accumulation of malfolded proteins within that subcellular compartment, this phenomenon is not elicited by the accumulation of the insoluble PiZ variant. These results indicate that neither the accumulation of this malfolded protein within the ER nor even the distention of that subcellular compartment is sufficient to cause the up-regulation of grp78/BiP levels. The interpretation of these results with regard to the factors that regulate the levels of grp78/BiP in the ER is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W136983229,"We established an experimental system suitable for study of cell cycle regulation by Ca2+ in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Systematic cell cycle analysis using media containing various concentrations of Ca2+, a Ca2(+)-ionophore (A23187), and a Ca2(+)-chelator [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) revealed that simultaneous addition of 10 microM A23187 and 10 mM EGTA to cells growing in a Ca2(+)-deficient medium at 22 degrees C caused rapid decrease in intracellular Ca content and resulted in transient G1 arrest followed by block mostly at G2/M, as revealed by flow cytometry. Recovery from G1 arrest was not due to coordinated initiation of DNA synthesis and bud emergence: unbudded cells with S or G2/M DNA were observed. Examination of terminal phenotype suggested that Ca2+ was required at all the stages of the cell cycle except for the initiation of DNA synthesis. The intracellular cAMP level decreased within 10 min of addition of A23187 and EGTA. No significant transient G1 arrest was observed in cells incubated with 8-Br-cAMP, or RAS2val19 and delta bcy1 mutants, which produce a high level of cAMP and have constitutively activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively. These results indicate that Ca2+ is essential for cell cycle progression and suggest that Ca2+ may regulate the cAMP level. This system will be useful for genetic and molecular studies on cell cycle events regulated by Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1520076420,"rap1B is a member of the ras superfamily of low molecular weight GTP binding proteins which constitutes a focal point of GTP and cAMP signal transduction systems. Like other members of this superfamily, rap1B is membrane-associated in resting platelets, presumably through polyisoprenylation. The studies presented here were undertaken to determine the subcellular changes in rap1B localization during cell activation. Activated and unactivated platelets were fractionated by Triton X-100 lysis followed by differential centrifugation to obtain a 10,000 x g cytoskeleton fraction, a 100,000 x g membrane skeleton fraction, and a 100,000 x g supernatant fraction containing solubilized proteins. In unactivated platelets, rap1B was present in the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction. In contrast, in platelets activated with 1 unit/ml alpha-thrombin or with the calcium ionophore, A23187, rap1B was quantitatively recovered in the 10,000 x g cytoskeleton fraction. rap1B was absent from the 100,000 x g fraction containing the membrane skeleton and could not be detected in the 100,000 x g supernatant containing cytosolic proteins and solubilized membrane components. These results indicate that rap1B associates with the cytoskeleton during cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1536871283,"Mutations in the insulin receptor gene can cause insulin resistance. Previously, we have identified a mutation substituting glutamic acid for lysine at position 460 in the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor in a patient with a genetic form of insulin resistance. In the present work, we have investigated the effect upon receptor function of amino acid substitutions at position 460. Decreasing the pH from 8.0 to 5.5 caused a progressive acceleration of the dissociation of 125I-insulin from the wild-type insulin receptor. Substitution of acidic amino acids (Glu or Asp) for Lys460 decreased the ability of acid pH to accelerate dissociation of 125I-insulin. In contrast, substitution of Arg or neutral amino acids (Val, Met, Thr, or Gln) had no effect upon the sensitivity to acid pH. Correlated with decreased sensitivity to acid pH, substitution of Glu or Asp at position 460 retarded the dissociation of 125I-insulin from intracellular receptors subsequent to receptor-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, retardation of dissociation of 125I-insulin from the internalized receptor was associated with a decreased half-life of the receptor. In summary, the Glu460 mutation appears to cause insulin resistance by accelerating receptor degradation and, thereby, decreasing the number of insulin receptors on the cell surface. Additional studies suggested that Lys460 may provide the amino groups whereby disuccinimidyl suberate cross-links the two alpha-subunits to each other. Consistent with the hypothesis that Lys460 is located at the interface between adjacent alpha-subunits, substitutions at position 460 impair cooperative interactions among insulin binding sites. The Glu460 mutation decreases positively cooperative binding interactions; the Arg460 mutation impairs negative cooperativity. Mutations at position 460 in the alpha-subunit did not decrease the ability of insulin to stimulate receptor tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W49251375,"In an earlier study we demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) increases the cellular accumulation of cAMP in perfused rat hearts by stimulating the cardiac adenylate cyclase via a stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Nair, B. G., Rashed, H. M., and Patel, T. B. (1989) Biochem. J. 264, 563-571). Employing antiserum, CS1, generated against a synthetic decapeptide RMHLRQYELL representing the carboxyl terminus of Gs alpha, the involvement of Gs in mediating the effects of EGF on cardiac adenylate cyclase was further investigated. The CS1 antiserum specifically recognized two forms, (52 and 40 kDa) of Gs alpha in rat cardiac membranes; the 52 kDa being the predominant species. In functional assays of adenylate cyclase activity, the CS1 antiserum did not alter either aluminum fluoride- or forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Similarly, basal adenylate cyclase activity in the absence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) was also not altered by the CS1 antiserum. However, as compared with controls performed in the presence of non-immune serum, preincubation of cardiac membranes with the CS1 antiserum resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of Gpp(NH)p-, isoproterenol-, and EGF-stimulated activities. In experiments which monitored Gi function as the ability of different G(pp)NHp, (-)N6-(R-phenylisopropyl)adenosine and carbachol to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase, CS1 antiserum by inhibiting Gs, increased the apparent activity of Gi. Overall, our data demonstrate that the CS1 antiserum can specifically inhibit Gs function and therefore the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by agonists whose actions are mediated by Gs. In this respect, the data presented here demonstrate that Gs is the G-protein involved in mediating EGF-elicited stimulation of cardiac adenylate cyclase. Additionally, the finding that CS1 antiserum can overcome the effects of Gpp(NH)p on Gs, but not Gi, suggests that the carboxyl-terminal region of Gs alpha is important in the interactions with GTP or its analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1887237889,"Dimethylarginine:pyruvate aminotransferase, which plays a role in the metabolism of dimethylarginines, has been purified to homogeneity from rat kidney. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 200,000 and an isoelectric point at about pH 6.3. The enzyme consists of four similar subunits having a molecular weight of about 50,000. The enzyme catalyzes the effective transaminations of guanidino-N methylated L-arginines (e.g. NG,NG-dimethyl-L-arginine, NG,N'G-dimethyl-L-arginine and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine) and the alpha-amino group of L-ornithine to pyruvate or glyoxylate. The enzyme was always accompanied by the known alanine:glyoxylate amino-transferase activity with the ratios of their specific activities remaining constant during the purification steps. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the purified enzyme were shown to be identical with those of the isozyme of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.44), designated as alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (Noguchi, T. (1987) in Peroxisomes in Biology and Medicine (Fahimi, H. D., and Sies, H., eds) pp. 234-243, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg). The distribution profiles in tissues and the negative response to glucagon treatment further supported the identity of the two enzymes. The present data show that alanine:glyoxilate aminotransferase 2 functions in dimethylarginine metabolism in vivo in rats."
https://openalex.org/W1493403683,"The reconstituted high density lipoproteins (rHDL) that were described in the preceding paper (Hefele Wald, J., Krul, E. S., and Jonas, A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 20037-20043) are used in this study to analyze the organization, conformation, and dynamics of the lipid phase, as well as the relative orientation of the apolipoprotein alpha-helices and the lipid hydrocarbon chains. Two fluorescence polarization probes and a fluorescence polarity probe were used to detect the lipid phase transition behavior of the various particles, and to estimate the lipid order, mobility, and environment polarity in their gel and liquid-crystalline states. Infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy was used to estimate the content of secondary structure of the apolipoprotein, and the orientation of its alpha-helices with respect to the lipid hydrocarbon chains. In addition, the infrared spectra were analyzed in terms of the conformation and organization of different regions of the lipid molecules in the rHDL particles. The results indicate that the overall organization and conformation of lipid molecules in a lipid bilayer is preserved in the rHDL particles, but that progressive increases in apolipoprotein content straighten the hydrocarbon chains and decrease their packing order in the gel state, and decrease their mobility in the liquid-crystalline state. The presence of apolipoprotein also affects the conformation of the lipids at the level of the ester bonds and the head group of the phospholipid. In all three particle classes the content and distribution of secondary structures of the apolipoprotein were similar, and the alpha-helical segments were parallel to the lipid hydrocarbon chains."
https://openalex.org/W1530669588,"The Bacillus subtilis sacU locus consists of two genes, degS and degU, which positively regulate the synthesis of several extracellular enzymes including the neutral and alkaline proteases. Both the DegS and DegU proteins have been purified from overproducing Escherichia coli strains harboring degS or degU gene-carrying plasmids, and the following results were obtained. DegS was autophosphorylated in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, and transferred the phosphoryl group to DegU. The transfer reaction was rapid in contrast to the autophosphorylation reaction. The phosphoryl groups incorporated into DegS and DegU were released at their own specific rates, the latter being twice faster than the former. The linkage between DegS and the phosphoryl moiety was unstable at acidic pH, whereas reverse was the case for the linkage between DegU and its phosphoryl group, suggesting that His and Asp are involved in the formation of DegS-phosphate and DegU-phosphate, respectively. Deletion of degS resulted in the reduced expression of the exocellular alkaline protease gene, aprE. These results suggest that phosphorylation of DegS by its own kinase activity and subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl group to DegU play a role in the activation of the aprE gene."
https://openalex.org/W1531948238,"To elucidate further the conformation of human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in lipid-bound states and its effect on the reaction with lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), we prepared reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles from a reaction mixture containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/apoA-I in the molar ratios of 150:7.5:1. The particles were separated by gel filtration into three classes of highly homogeneous and reproducible discs with diameters of 97, 136, and 186 A, containing 2, 3, and 4 molecules of apoA-I/disc, respectively, and increasing proportions of phospholipid and cholesterol. These three classes of particles were then investigated by a variety of fluorescence techniques, to probe the average environment and mobility of the tryptophan (Trp) residues in the structure of apoA-I. We found small, gradual changes in the fluorescence parameters with changes in the size of the rHDL, consistent with a shift of Trp residues to a more hydrophobic and more rigid environment, as well as an increased resistance of apoA-I to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride in the larger particles. In contrast, circular dichroism measurements and binding studies with seven monoclonal antibodies indicated a similar alpha-helical structure (73%) for apoA-I in all the particles, and similar exposure of apoA-I epitopes in the COOH-terminal two-thirds of the apolipoprotein. Thus the structure of apoA-I is comparable for the three classes of particles and is consistent with the presence of eight alpha-helical segments per apoA-I in contact with the lipid. In addition, we obtained the apparent kinetic parameters for the reaction of the rHDL particles with lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase. The apparent Km values were similar but the apparent Vmax decreased almost 8-fold, going from the 97- to the 186-A particles; therefore, the decreasing reactivity for the larger particles can be attributed mainly to differences in the catalytic rate constant. The rate limiting step is probably affected by local structural differences in the apoA-I, or by the interfacial properties of the lipid."
https://openalex.org/W1559723325,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the fibrinolytic cascade: conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasma contains several inhibitors of t-PA that limit its activity and prevent systemic activation of plasminogen. The most important of these is endothelial cell plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene family. We have previously demonstrated that mutation of arginine 304 of t-PA to a glutamic acid residue drastically reduces the rate of interaction between the enzyme and its suicide substrate, PAI-1, without affecting the reactivity of the enzyme toward its normal substrate, plasminogen (Madison, E. L., Goldsmith, E. J., Gerard, R.D., Gething, M.J., and Sambrook, J.F. (1989) Nature 339, 721-724). We report here the use of protein modeling to design a compensatory mutation in PAI-1 (glutamic acid 350 to arginine) and create a molecule that rapidly inhibits this serpin-resistant variant of t-PA."
https://openalex.org/W1534448823,"Active-site-blocked, fluorescent derivatives of tPA (Activase) and a variant (delta FEIX) which lacks the finger and epidermal growth factor-like domains and possesses Asn to Gln and Val to Met mutations at residues 117 and 245, respectively, were prepared. The binding of these to fibrin was studied by adding them at systematically varying concentrations to fibrinogen, at a fixed concentration, inducing clotting with thrombin, separating free and bound tPA or delta FEIX by centrifugation, and measuring the concentration of unbound material by extrinsic fluorescence. Similar studies were performed with Glu and Lys-plasminogen, using intrinsic fluorescence. epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA) was utilized to distinguish kringle-dependent from finger-dependent binding. In the absence of EACA, delta FEIX-bound fibrin through a single class of sites with Kd = 0.69 microM and n = 1.34 delta FEIX/fibrin. The binding of delta FEIX was completely inhibited by EACA and 50% displacement occurred at [EACA] = 300 microM. Fibrin-bound tPA was only partially displaced with EACA. In the presence of 30 mM EACA, tPA binding reflected a single class of sites with Kd = 0.26 microM and n = 0.60 tPA/fibrin. In the absence of EACA, tPA binding was complex, typified by downwardly curved Scatchard plots, and was consistent with interactions of the two classes of sites, characterized by Kd = 0.13 microM, n = 0.60 and Kd = 0.61 microM, n = 1.23. These were attributed to finger and kringle-dependent interactions, respectively. Under the experimental conditions employed, Glu-plasminogen exhibited no binding to fibrin, whereas Lys-plasminogen bound to a single class of sites with Kd = 0.25 microM and n = 1.02 plasminogen/fibrin. This binding was completely inhibited by EACA and 50% displacement occurred at [EACA] = 28 microM. Competition experiments indicated that Lys-plasminogen does not displace either tPA or delta FEIX from fibrin. From these results the conclusions are drawn that tPA can interact with intact fibrin by two different and independent modes, involving, respectively, the finger and kringle 2 domains, and neither of these modes are competitive with the kringle-dependent binding of Lys-plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W1982432969,"Insertion of bacteriophage coat proteins into the membrane of infected bacterial cells can be studied as a model system of protein translocation across membranes. The coat protein of the filamentous bacteriophage Pf3—which infects Pseudomonas aeruginosa—is 44 amino acids in length and has the same basic structure as the coat protein of bacteriophage M13, which infects Escherichia coli. However, unlike the Pf3 coat protein, the M13 coat protein is synthesized as a precursor (procoat) with a typical leader (signal) sequence, which is cleaved after membrane insertion. Nevertheless, when the gene encoding the Pf3 coat protein is expressed in E. coli, the protein is translocated across the membrane. Hybrid M13 and Pf3 coat proteins were constructed in an attempt to understand how the Pf3 coat protein is translocated without a leader sequence. These studies demonstrated that the extracellular regions of the proteins determined their cellular location. When three charged residues in this region were neutralized, the leader-free M13 coat protein was also inserted into the membrane. Differences in the water shell surrounding these residues may account for efficient membrane insertion of the protein without a leader sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1668018116,"Human ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is a cytoplasmic factor that stimulates the GTPase activity of normal N-ras p21 while having no stimulatory effect on the GTPase activity of oncogenic variants of N-ras p21. We have purified two forms of native ras GAP from human placental tissue. In addition to the Mr = 120,000 type I GAP reported previously (1), an equivalent amount of an Mr = 95,000 molecule with GAP activity was recovered and shown to have the N-terminal sequence expected for type II GAP. The two GAP forms in placental extracts were resolved by molecular sieve chromatography and appeared to have a monomeric native structure. Human recombinant type I GAP was produced intracellularly in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector, and 10-mg quantities were purified to homogeneity in three steps. Comparison of the purified native and recombinant GAP molecules revealed that all three displayed similar biological specific activities in an in vitro GAP assay. A polyclonal antibody to purified recombinant GAP was prepared and shown to neutralize the activity of both native and recombinant GAPs. The antibody was also highly specific for the detection of native GAP by Western blot. Type I and II GAP species were detected in approximately equal amounts in cytoplasmic extracts of human placenta, but only type I GAP was observed when other human tissues were examined."
https://openalex.org/W1546420641,RNA from a partial cDNA clone containing the entire protein coding sequence of Drosophila melanogaster acetyl-CoA:choline O-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6; choline acetyltransferase) can be translated into active enzyme. This is unusual since this partial cDNA clone contains no appropriate ATG (AUG) initiation codon. In this study we use in vitro deletion and point mutants to identify GTG as the starting codon for protein translation. We also report the sequence of a full length Drosophila choline acetyltransferase cDNA and demonstrate that RNA produced by this clone is translated into active choline acetyltransferase but at a significantly reduced efficiency when compared to the partial cDNA clone. These results indicate that translational control may be an important regulatory step in production of Drosophila choline acetyltransferase.

https://openalex.org/W1601890318,"Nucleosome and chromatin structure/function relationships of histone acetylations are not understood. To address these questions we have developed chromatographic procedures that separate subtypes of H3 and the acetylated states of histone H3 and H4 in exceptionally pure forms. The sites of acetylation of the intermediately acetylated states of H3 have been determined and show a specific pattern of acetylation. An unexpected finding was the identification of a fifth site of acetylation in H3 at lysine 27. Nucleosome particles with fully acetylated H3 and H4 have been assembled on the Lytechinus variegatus 5 S rRNA DNA phasing sequence and characterized. These defined acetylated H3 and H4 particles migrate more slowly in polyacrylamide nucleoprotein particle gels than the control particles indicating a subtle effect of acetylation in nucleosome structure. However, DNA footprinting of these particles using DNase I show only small changes when compared to control particles over the core particle DNA length. It is shown further that H3 cysteines in the particle containing fully acetylated H3 and H4 were not accessible to iodoacetamide indicating that protein factors additional to H3 and H4 acetylation are required to make H3 cysteines accessible to the label. These findings are consistent with the proposal that histones H3, H4 acetylations exert their major effects outside of the core particle 146-base pair DNA, either on the DNA segment entering and leaving the nucleosome or possibly on the internucleosome interactions that involve the amino-terminal domains of the core histones in organization and stability of higher order chromatin structures."
https://openalex.org/W21061013,"C5a elicits a variety of responses from the polymorphonuclear leukocyte all of which utilize G proteins as transducing elements. In the present study, we report the consequences of the interaction between the C5a receptor and the G proteins and describe a system which may allow identification of the transducing proteins. C5a binding to polymorphonuclear leukocyte membranes is inhibited by pertussis, but not cholera, toxin and by a variety of guanine nucleotides. In the absence of nucleotide, we observed a single class of sites with a Kd of 17 pM. The presence of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) did not alter this affinity but did result in a concentration-dependent decrease in the number of binding sites. Surprisingly, we did not observe the concomitant appearance of a low affinity state implying that, if such a state exists, its affinity is below our limit of detection (5 nM). The receptor and G protein retained their functional interaction following solubilization of the membrane in digitonin. In the absence of nucleotide, we observed a single class of sites with a Kd of 28 pM. Addition of GTP gamma S suppressed binding, and, as was found in membranes, this inhibition is due almost entirely to a decrease in the number of sites. Again we failed to detect the appearance of a lower affinity state. Gel filtration studies of the detergent-solubilized receptor and receptor-C5a complexes indicate that the receptor is precoupled to G protein in the absence of ligand (C5a)."
https://openalex.org/W1587788294,"We devised an in situ assay method for the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) that catalyzes the first step in sphingolipid biosynthesis and isolated a temperature-sensitive mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells with thermolabile SPT. This mutant stopped growing at 40 degrees C after several generations, although the cells grew at 33 and 37 degrees C at rates similar to those of the parent. The SPT activity in cell homogenates of the mutant grown at low temperatures was 4-8% of that in the parent homogenates. When the cells were cultured for several generations at 40 degrees C, the activity in the mutant homogenate became negligible. When cell homogenates were incubated at 45 degrees C before enzyme assay, mutant SPT was more markedly inactivated than parental SPT, indicating that mutant SPT had become thermolabile. The rates of de novo synthesis of sphingolipids in the mutant were much slower at 40 degrees C than at lower temperatures, in contrast to those in the parent. The sphingomyelin content in the mutant cultivated at 40 degrees C for several generations was also less than that at low temperatures. These results indicate that SPT functions in the main pathway for sphingolipid biosynthesis. The temperature-sensitive growth of the mutant defective in sphingolipid synthesis suggests that sphingolipid(s) plays an essential role in cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1605456662,"Mobilization of sequestered intracellular Ca2+ with EGTA or Ca2+ ionophores severely depresses rates of translational initiation in various mammalian cell types including C6 glial, GH3 pituitary and P3X63Ag8 myeloma cells. Within 2-3 h of continuous exposure to either chelator or ionophore, cells adapt or accommodate such that their rates of amino acid incorporation are restored to 40-70% of those of untreated controls. In GH3 and P3X63Ag8 cells, treatment with either a phorbol ester or a cAMP-elevating agent was required to obtain maximal degrees of accommodation of translational initiation. Following the development of accommodation, cells restored with optimal Ca2+ exhibited rates of amino acid incorporation identical with those of nontreated controls but remained resistance to inhibition on subsequent challenge with EGTA or ionophore. Development of translational tolerance to agents depleting Ca2+ stores did not involve alterations in cellular capacity or affinity for the cation. Invariably, the development of tolerance was preceded by transcriptionally dependent, preferential synthesis of the reticuloplasmin GRP78/BiP. In Ca2(+)-deprived GH3 cells, the synthesis of GRP78 was promoted by phorbol ester and cAMP with the extent of induction correlating directly with the degree of translational tolerance to ionophore. Cells pretreated with dithiothreitol, an alternate inducer of GRP78, also became tolerant to translational inhibition by Ca2+ ionophore or EGTA. Amino acid incorporation in nonsecreting NS-1-cloned myeloma cells, which constitutively express high levels of GRP78 and its mRNA, resisted inhibition by EGTA, ionophore, and dithiothreitol. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against GRP78 mRNA reduced amino acid incorporation in tolerant, but not in non-tolerant, preparations. These results predicate the existence of a mechanism whereby mammalian cells are capable of rapidly developing translational cross-tolerance to either depletion of sequestered Ca2+ or a reducing environment. A role for nascent GRP78 is strongly implicated in this accommodation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1487954640,"Platelet glycoprotein Ib is a major platelet membrane protein composed of two disulfide-linked chains, termed the alpha and beta chains. The larger alpha chain (GpIb alpha), a platelet receptor for von Willebrand factor, plays a major role in mediating platelet adhesion to the subendothelium. Our laboratories have previously reported synthesis of a protein in human endothelial cells that is immunoprecipitated with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to platelet GpIb alpha. Lopez et al. (Lopez, J. A., Chung, D. W., Fujikawa, K., Hagan, F. S., Papayannopoulou, T., and Roth, G. J. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 5615-5619) have reported the cloning of GpIb alpha from a human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell cDNA library. Using this clone as probe, we have isolated two partial GpIb alpha clones from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell lambda gt11 cDNA library. These clones were localized within HEL-derived GpIb alpha cDNA by sequence and restriction enzyme analysis. Additionally, they detected the same message species in HEL and tonsilar RNA that was detected with the HEL GpIb alpha cDNA. Low level GpIb alpha mRNA expression was detected in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which was increased by treatment of the cells with tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This effect was enhanced by pretreatment with interferon-gamma. Additionally, localization of GpIb alpha in endothelium of fresh tonsilar tissue was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. GpIb alpha may play a role in mediating platelet or other effector cell adhesion to activated endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W1498296186,"The effect of anoxia and reoxygenation on the synthesis and secretion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was studied in primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Sublethal anoxia, determined by trypan blue dye exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase release, was produced by cell culture under a 95% N2, 5% CO2 atmosphere for 2-24 h and was followed by reoxygenation with 95% air, 5% CO2 for 24 or 48 h. Anoxia did not alter the levels of mRNA for t-PA or PAI-1 in the cells or the secretion of t-PA or PAI-1 into the medium. At 24 h, t-PA secreted into conditioned medium was 7.0 +/- 1.4 ng/2 x 10(6) cells (n = 9) and PAI-1 was 300 +/- 13 IU/2 x 10(6) cells (n = 9), whereas the content of t-PA mRNA was 2.2 pg/micrograms of RNA and PAI-1 mRNA was 180 pg/micrograms of RNA. During reoxygenation, however, t-PA antigen and PAI-1 activity as well as mRNA for PAI-1 decreased proportionally to the duration of anoxia, to reach 27 +/- 1.0, 49 +/- 2.0, and 47 +/- 14% of control values, respectively, within 24 h of anoxia. t-PA mRNA also decreased significantly during reoxygenation following anoxia, but the extent could not be accurately quantitated. Addition, during anoxia, of a 200 micrograms/ml concentration of the superoxide anion radical scavenger superoxide dismutase or of a 5 mM concentration of the iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate prevented the subsequent decrease of t-PA antigen during reoxygenation; addition of these compounds during reoxygenation had no effect. Superoxide dismutase, but not deferoxamine mesylate, when added during anoxia prevented the subsequent decrease in PAI-1 activity. These studies suggest that the marked alteration of endothelial cell fibrinolysis during anoxia followed by reoxygenation is most likely mediated by a mechanism dependent on oxygen radicals. Impaired endothelial cell fibrinolysis may contribute to the pathophysiology of ischemia/reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W1496425493,"Kinetic analysis of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase has implicated a glutamate or aspartate residue in (i) formation of mevaldate thiohemiacetal by proton transfer to the carbonyl oxygen of mevaldate and (ii) enhanced ionization of CoASH by the resulting enzyme carboxylate anion, facilitating attack by CoAS- on the carbonyl carbon of mevaldate (Veloso, D., Cleland, W. W., and Porter, J. W. (1981) Biochemistry 81, 887-894). Although neither the identity of this acidic residue nor its location is known, the catalytic domains of 11 sequenced HMG-CoA reductases contain only 3 conserved acidic residues. For HMG-CoA reductase of Pseudomonas mevalonii, these residues are Glu52, Glu83, and Asp183. To identify the acidic residue that functions in catalysis, we generated mutants having alterations in these residues. The mutant proteins were expressed, purified, and characterized. Mutational alteration of residues Glu52 or Asp183 of P. mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase yielded enzymes with significant, but in some cases reduced, activity (Vmax = 100% Asp183----Ala, 65% Asp183----Asn, and 15% Glu52----Gln of wild-type activity, respectively). Although the activity of mutant enzymes Glu52----Gln and Asp183----Ala was undetectable under standard assay conditions, their Km values for substrates were 4-300-fold higher than those for wild-type enzyme. Km values for wild-type enzyme and for mutant enzymes Glu52----Gln and Asp183----Ala were, respectively: 0.41, 73, and 120 mM [R,S)-mevalonate); 0.080, 4.4, and 2.0 mM (coenzyme A); and 0.26, 4.4, and 1.0 mM (NAD+). By these criteria, neither Glu52 nor Asp183 is the acidic catalytic residue although each may function in substrate recognition. During chromatography on coenzyme A agarose or HMG-CoA agarose, mutant enzymes Asp183----Asn and Glu83----Gln behaved like wild-type enzyme. By contrast, and in support of a role for these residues in substrate recognition, mutant enzymes Glu52----Gln and Asp183----Ala exhibited impaired ability to bind to either support. Despite displaying Km values for substrates and chromatographic behavior on substrate affinity supports comparable to wild-type enzyme, only mutant enzyme Glu83----Gln was essentially inactive under all conditions studied (Vmax = 0.2% that of wild-type enzyme). Glutamate residue 83 of P. mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase, and consequently the glutamate of the consensus Pro-Met-Ala-Thr-Thr-Glu-Gly-Cys-Leu-Val-Ala motif of the catalytic domains of eukaryotic HMG-CoA reductases, is judged to be the acidic residue functional in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1559187395,"Preparations of amidinated cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase, cross-linked by using a soluble carbodiimide to promote the formation of covalent bonds between carboxyl groups of the hemeprotein and nucleophilic residues of the flavoprotein at the surfaces involved in protein-protein contacts during electron transfer, have been used to characterize the charge pair interactions that occur during electron transfer between the free proteins. Sequence analyses of tryptic, V8 protease-, and Asp-N protease-generated peptides show that the heme propionyl carboxyl group at the surface of the cytochrome forms an ester bond with Ser162 of the reductase, thus implicating Lys163 as the normal participant in ionic bonding between the active sites of the two proteins. Moreover, Lys41 and Lys125 directly form amide bonds with carboxyl residues on the active-site surface of the cytochrome. In the case of Lys41, this involves Glu52 and/or Glu60, and Glu47 and/or Glu48 for Lys125, again implicating these residues as the groups that form charge pairs during normal interactions between the active sites of the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1480694753,"The interaction of human serum apolipoprotein A-I with dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol was analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry. Binding of the apolipoprotein A-I to large unilamellar vesicles of dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol, a negatively charged phospholipid, is characterized by thermodynamic parameters which are invariant over the 30-40 degrees C temperature range. The enthalpy change resulting from the first additions of lipid are positive and decline in magnitude with subsequent additions of lipid. After several additions of lipid, the sign of the enthalpy changes to negative and then reaches a constant value/injection. This exothermic process is larger and opposite in sign to the heat of dilution. Similar behavior is also observed when the lipid is in the form of a dispersion in distilled water. Only a non-saturable exothermic process is observed at 30 degrees C with large unilamellar vesicles of the zwitterionic lipid, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. The beginning of an exothermic process can also be observed prior to the larger endotherm in the first injections of large unilamellar vesicles of dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol into the protein. We analyze the enthalpy changes for the reaction of dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol with the protein as arising from two distinct processes, one endothermic and the other exothermic. The binding isotherms for the high affinity binding of the apolipoprotein A-I to large unilammelar vesicles of dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol, over the temperature range 30-40 degrees C, gave an enthalpy change of 1.43 +/- 0.07 kcal/mol of protein and a free energy change of -5.91 +/- 0.04 kcal/mol of protein for the binding of the protein to a cluster of 25 +/- 2 lipid molecules. Thus this reaction is entropically driven."
https://openalex.org/W1580206036,"A cDNA clone encoding the complete protein sequence of the precursor form of bovine cytochrome P450(11)beta has been constructed using a combined technique of first strand cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction. Upon expression of this cDNA in COS 1 cells the P450(11)beta is found to be proteolytically processed and localized in the mitochondrion. This cDNA encodes the major form of P450(11)beta found in bovine adrenal cortex (designated 11 beta-3; Kirita, S., Morohashi, K., Hashimoto, T., Yoshioka, H., Fujii-Kuriyama, Y., and Omura, T. (1988) J. Biochem. 104, 683-686) and is capable of catalyzing 11 beta-hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, and androstenedione in COS 1 cells as well as aldosterone synthesis from deoxycorticosterone. In addition, a second form of P450(11)beta (herein designated 11 beta-4), having no detectable 11 beta-hydroxylase activity or aldosterone synthase activity, was found in the local bovine population by this cloning procedure. These two forms of P450(11)beta (11 beta-3 and 11 beta-4) contain five amino acid differences between them, all located within the amino-terminal half of the molecules. By changing 2 of the amino acids in the inactive form to the corresponding amino acids in the active form (Leu66----Phe and Pro126----Ser) both 11 beta-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthetase activities were completely restored. Neither of these changes alone led to detectable activity. Thus, upon expression in mitochondria of heterologous cells, bovine P450(11)beta catalyzes both 11 beta-hydroxylation and aldosterone synthesis as reported previously for the purified enzyme in an in vitro reconstituted system, and Phe66 and Ser126 seem to be important residues in maintaining both activities."
https://openalex.org/W1651945746,"The polar, COOH-terminal c-region of signal peptides has been considered to be most important for influencing the efficiency and fidelity of signal peptidase cleavage while the hydrophobic core or h-region appears indispensable for initiating translocation. To identify structural features of residues flanking the c-region that influence the fidelity and efficiency of signal peptidase cleavage as well as co-translational translocation, we introduced six amino acid substitutions into the COOH terminus of the hydrophobic core and seven substitutions at the NH2 terminus of the mature region (the +1 position) of a model eukaryotic preprotein-human pre(delta pro)apoA-II. This preprotein contains several potential sites for signal peptidase cleavage. The functional consequences of these mutations were assayed using an in vitro co-translational translocation/processing system and by post-translational cleavage with purified, detergent-solubilized, hen oviduct signal peptidase. The efficiency of translocation could be correlated with the hydrophobic character of the residue introduced at the COOH terminus of the h-region. Some h/c boundary mutants underwent co-translational translocation across the microsomal membrane with only minimal cleavage yet they were cleaved post-translationally by hen oviduct signal peptidase more efficiently than other mutants which exhibited a high degree of coupling of co-translational translocation and cleavage. These data suggest that features at the COOH terminus of the h-domain can influence presentation of the cleavage site to signal peptidase. The +1 residue substitutions had minor effects on the extent of co-translational translocation and processing. However, these +1, as well as h/c boundary mutations, had dramatic effects on the site of cleavage chosen by signal peptidase, indicating that residues flanking the c-region of this prototypic eukaryotic signal peptide can affect the fidelity of its proteolytic processing. The site(s) selected by canine microsomal and purified hen oviduct signal peptidase were very similar, suggesting that intrinsic structural features of this prepeptide can influence the selectivity of eukaryotic signal peptidase cleavage, independent of the microsomal membrane and associated translocation apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1603983256,"We have established a ricin-resistant glycosylation-defective PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line to study biochemically glycoprotein traffic from the cell surface to the Golgi apparatus in regulated secretory cells. The strategy employed in this study is a modification of that used previously (Duncan, J. R., and Kornfeld, S. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 106, 617-628) to demonstrate transport of the cation-independent and -dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network in nonsecretory cell types. In ricin-resistant PC12 cells, radiolabeled galactose was incorporated enzymatically into surface glycoconjugates, primarily glycoproteins. Resistance to beta-galactosidase was acquired upon reculture at 37 degrees C due to further terminal glycosylation of the galactose residues. Treatment of N-linked oligosaccharides isolated from recultured cells with a variety of glycosidases in conjunction with beta-galactosidase demonstrated the addition of sialic acid N-acetylglucosamine and fucose residues to the galactose residues in recultured cells. Resistance to beta-galactosidase was not acquired in cells recultured at 19 degrees C, indicating that subsequent glycosylation of galactose residues did not occur at the cell surface or in endosomes. While glycosylation of galactose incorporated into asparagine oligosaccharides in Chinese hamster ovary clone 13 cells was not significant (less than 1%) after 6 h of reculture, approximately 10% of the galactose incorporated into surface oligosaccharides was further glycosylated in PC12 cells in this time. Analysis of total labeled versus beta-galactosidase-resistant proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that endocytic traffic to the site of glycosylation activity in mutant PC12 cells was highly selective, but included a much greater number of proteins than were detected in Chinese hamster ovary clone 13 fibroblasts."

Prephenate dehydrogenase and arogenate dehydrogenase activities could not be separated throughout fractionation steps yielding a purification of more than 200-fold, and the ratio of activities was constant throughout purification. Thus, the enzyme is a cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of 150,000 and is a hexamer made up of identical 25,500 subunits. The enzyme is specific for NAD+ as an electron acceptor, and identical Km values of 0.25 mM were obtained for NAD+, regardless of whether activity was assayed as prephenate dehydrogenase or as arogenate dehydrogenase. Km values of 0.07 mM and 0.17 mM were calculated for prephenate and L-arogenate, respectively. Inhibition by L-tyrosine was noncompetitive with respect to NAD+, but was strictly competitive with respect to either prephenate or L-arogenate. With cyclohexadiene as variable substrate, similar Ki values for L-tyrosine of 0.06 mM (prephenate) and 0.05 mM (L-arogenate) were obtained. With NAD+ as the variable substrate, similar Ki values for L-tyrosine of 0.26 mM (prephenate) and 0.28 mM (L-arogenate), respectively, were calculated.

Immunoblot analysis of transfected COS cells with an antibody to residues 159-168 of the alpha i1 protein indicated that all four proteins were expressed. Unlike the WT and GA proteins, both CVLS mutant proteins failed to react with an antibody specific for the carboxyl terminus and failed to undergo pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Analysis of COS cell lysates after [3H]mevalonic acid labeling indicated that specific incorporation of radioactivity occurred only in the alpha i1 subunits with the CVLS mutation. Immuno-precipitation of COS cell fractions after labeling with [35S]methionine indicated that both WT and CVLS mutant proteins were localized predominantly in the particulate fraction, whereas GA and GA-CVLS mutant proteins were found primarily in the soluble fraction. These results directly demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal sequence, CGLF, is incapable of leading to isoprenylation but that alteration of two residues (glycine to valine, phenylalanine to serine) is sufficient to promote isoprenylation."

Sugar analysis showed the presence of sialic acid, galactose, mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine, i.e. sugars typical for N-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains. The absence of N-acetylgalactosamine revealed that O-glycosidically linked carbohydrates were not present. The purified antibody was reduced, alkylated, and separated into heavy and light chains, and all carbohydrates were shown to be associated with the heavy chains. The N-linked carbohydrate chains were isolated as alditols using strong alkaline-borohydride degradation and further fractionated on a concanavalin A-Sepharose column and high performance ion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. Structural analysis was carried out on the isolated oligosaccharide alditols by chemical analyses, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Triantennary and biantenary types of structures were found. The triantennary structures were present as trisialo and tetrasialo forms without fucose; the tetrasialo forms were shown to contain a sequence of Neu5Ac alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3[Neu5Ac alpha 2-6]GlcNAc beta 1- on one of the branches.

(1989) J. Cell Biol. 108,2211-2219). Thus, the secretory lesion correlates with reduced fluid-phase endocytosis without impairing the clathrin-dependent pathway of receptor-mediated endocytosis. We also investigated the delivery of endocytosed material to lysosomes and found that delivery was partially, but not completely, impaired in the mutant. This suggests that endocytosed material can enter lysosomes, although slowly, in the absence of a functional secretory pathway."

The selectivity of the enzyme for altered proteins in intact cells was explored by co-injecting Xenopus laevis oocytes with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine and structurally altered calmodulins generated during a 14-day preincubation in vitro. Control experiments indicated that the oocyte protein carboxyl methyltransferase was not saturated with endogenous substrates, since protein carboxyl methylation rates could be stimulated up to 8-fold by increasing concentrations of injected calmodulin. The oocyte protein carboxyl methyltransferase showed strong selectivities for bovine brain and bacterially synthesized calmodulins which had been preincubated in the presence of 1 mM EDTA relative to calmodulins which had been preincubated with 1 mM CaCl2. Radioactive methyl groups were incorporated into base-stable linkages with recombinant calmodulin as well as into carboxyl methyl esters following its microinjection into oocytes. This base-stable radioactivity most likely represents the trimethylation of lysine 115, a highly conserved post-translational modification which is present in bovine and Xenopus but not in bacterially synthesized calmodulin. Endogenous oocyte calmodulin incorporates radioactivity into both carboxyl methyl esters and into base-stable linkages following microinjection of oocytes with S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine alone. The rate of oocyte calmodulin carboxyl methylation in injected oocytes is calculated to be similar to that of lysine 115 trimethylation, suggesting that the rate of calmodulin carboxyl methylation is similar to that of calmodulin synthesis. At steady state, oocyte calmodulin contains approximately 0.0002 esters/mol of protein, which turn over rapidly. The results suggest the quantitative significance of carboxyl methylation in the metabolism of oocyte calmodulin."

https://openalex.org/W1529916298,"We have shown that hybrid proteins composed of the yeast repressible acid phosphatase (PHO5) and bacterial beta-galactosidase (lacZ) interfere with secretion of native acid phosphatase (Wolfe, P. B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6908-6915). We now report that PHO5-LacZ hybrid proteins have a more general effect on secretion and prevent translocation of several secreted proteins. Translocation of both the mating pheromone alpha-factor and the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y is partially blocked when PHO5-LacZ hybrids are expressed. Cell fractionation and protease sensitivity indicate that alpha-factor and carboxypeptidase Y accumulate in precursor form on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. Indirect immunofluorescence with antibody directed against beta-galactosidase supports the localization of hybrid proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. Analysis of the hybrid protein phenotype in vivo and in vitro suggests that the hybrid proteins deplete a soluble factor required for efficient translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum. First, a decrease in the expression of a hybrid protein in vivo decreases its effect on translocation. Second, an in vitro translation/translocation reaction, prepared from a hybrid-bearing strain, is deficient in its ability to translocate prepro-alpha-factor across yeast microsomal membranes. This deficiency is complemented by addition of cytosol prepared from wild type cells. Finally, the hybrid protein phenotype is shown to be independent of the requirement for SSA gene products."
