https://openalex.org/W1497553226,"Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a novel cytokine which possesses neutrophil chemotactic and activating activities in addition to chemotactic activity for basophils and T lymphocytes. It has been shown that IL-8 is produced by a variety of human somatic cells including monocytes/macrophages, dermal fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, keratinocytes, mesangeal cells, and several types of tumor cell lines. We have examined here whether or not human gastric cancer cell lines produce IL-8 in vitro. The production of IL-8 protein was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the culture supernatants derived from eight of nine human gastric cancer cell lines stimulated with either interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), or TNF alpha plus interferon gamma (IFN gamma). In some of the gastric cancer cell lines such as MKN 45 and KATO, TNF alpha plus IFN gamma synergistically induced the production of IL-8. In MKN 45 cells, synergistic increase of the steady state level of IL-8 mRNA by TNF alpha plus IFN gamma was not inhibited by cycloheximide treatment. Scatchard analysis revealed that IFN gamma changed neither the number nor the affinity constant of TNF alpha binding sites on a gastric cancer cell line, suggesting that the synergism was a post-receptor event. Furthermore, synergistic induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity by TNF alpha plus IFN gamma was observed in MKN 45 that were transiently transfected with chimeric chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes driven by the transcriptional regulatory region of human IL-8 gene. Through the mutation of the regulatory region of the IL-8 gene, both AP-1- and NF-kB-like factor binding elements were presumed to be involved in conferring the responsiveness to TNF alpha plus IFN gamma. Moreover, gel retardation analyses revealed that TNF alpha and IFN gamma synergistically induced the binding of NF-kB like as well as AP-1 like proteins bound to these sites. These results indicated that IFN gamma synergistically enhanced TNF alpha-induced IL-8 production in a human gastric cancer cell line through synergistic activation of transcription factors without up-regulating TNF alpha receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1528708922,"The purification and initial characterization of arsenite oxidase from Alcaligenes faecalis are described. The enzyme consists of a monomer of 85 kDa containing one molybdenum, five or six irons, and inorganic sulfide. In the presence of denaturants arsenite oxidase releases a fluorescent material with spectral properties identical to the pterin cofactor released by the hydroxylase class of molybdenum-containing enzymes. Azurin and a c-type cytochrome, both isolated from A. faecalis, each serves as an electron acceptor to arsenite oxidase and may form a periplasmic electron transfer pathway for arsenite detoxification. Full reduction of arsenite oxidase requires 3-4 reducing equivalents, using either arsenite or dithionite as the electron source. Below 20 K, oxidized arsenite oxidase exhibits an EPR signal with g values of 2.03, 2.01, and 2.00, which integrates to approximately 0.4 spins/protein. Since enrichment in 57Fe results in broadening of this EPR signal, the center giving rise to this signal must contain iron. The most plausible candidates are a [4Fe-4S] high potential iron protein center or a [3Fe-4S] center. The EPR signal observed in oxidized arsenite oxidase disappears upon reduction of the protein with either arsenite or dithionite. Concomitantly, a rhombic EPR signal (g = 2.03, 1.89, 1.76) appears which is similar to that of Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] clusters and spin quantifies to one spin/protein."
https://openalex.org/W1532810559,"We have used native gel electrophoresis followed by fluorogenic peptide overlay to identify multiple forms of rabbit reticulocyte multicatalytic protease (MCP) or 20 S protease, and two forms of rabbit 26 S ubiquitin/ATP-dependent protease. An abundant, fast-migrating 20 S complex (20 SF) possesses modest ability to hydrolyze the fluorogenic peptide succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide. In contrast, two minor, slower migrating species cleave the peptide at high rates. A unique 30-kDa polypeptide is associated with one of the active MCPs, and a 160-kDa subunit is associated with the other. Two electrophoretically distinct 26 S proteases can also be isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The faster migrating form, 26 SF, is more resistant to inactivation by ATP depletion. Despite the differential response to nucleotides and the distinctive electrophoretic mobilities of 26 SF and 26 SS, we have not identified any subunit differences between the two enzymes. In addition to active 26 S proteases, we have discovered and purified a proteolytically inactive particle that contains subunits characteristic of the 26 S protease (e.g. molecular masses between 30 and 110 kDa). Incubation of this protein complex with purified MCP and ATP results in the formation of the 26 S proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1531096514,"A variety of cell types regulate their volume in anisotonic media by stimulating Na+/H+ exchange. Like growth factors, osmotic challenge activates the Na+/H+ antiport by increasing its sensitivity to intracellular [H+]. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this shift in pH sensitivity, the antiporter of 32P-labeled human bladder carcinoma cells and of Chinese hamster ovary cells was immunoprecipitated using antibodies raised against the cytosolic domain of the NHE-1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Unlike the effects of growth promoters, activation of the antiport during volume regulation was not associated with increased phosphorylation. The possible coexistence of multiple antiporter isoforms was considered. The cytosolic alkalosis normally elicited by hypertonic media was found to be absent in Na+/H+ exchange-deficient fibroblasts. Responsiveness to osmotic challenge was restored by stable transfection of these cells with the cDNA encoding NHE-1. In these transfectants, phosphorylation of the antiporter was also unaffected during osmotic activation. The unchanged phosphate content of the antiporter might be explained by dephosphorylation of one site with concomitant phosphorylation at a different site. However, this possibility appears unlikely since phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that serine was the only residue phosphorylated in immunoprecipitated antiports of both control and osmotically stimulated cells. Moreover, phosphopeptide maps of control and hypertonically activated antiports were identical. These findings reveal a novel mode of activation of Na+/H+ exchange not requiring direct phosphorylation of the antiporter. We propose the existence of dual control of Na+/H+ exchange by phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1582508691,"2',3'-Dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (cis-(+/-)-SddC) was found to have potent activity against hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency viruses in culture. Recent studies by us identified (-)-SddC as the stereoisomer responsible for the antiviral effect and showed that the cytotoxicity was mainly caused by (+)-SddC. Metabolism studies showed that these drugs were converted to their monophosphates, diphosphates, and triphosphates. The enzyme responsible for the formation of monophosphates was identified to be cytoplasmic deoxycytidine kinase in CEM cells. Uptake studies showed that the intracellular concentration of (-)-SddC and its metabolites was approximately 5-fold higher than that of (+)-SddC metabolites. (-)-SddCTP was more potent than (+)-SddCTP in inhibiting hepatitis B virus replication; (+)- and (-)-SddCTP exhibited minimal inhibition on polymerases alpha and delta, more inhibition on beta, and strong inhibition on gamma. In all cases, (+)-SddCTP was found to be more inhibitory than (-)-SddCTP to all four polymerases. (+)-SddCMP competed with dCTP for incorporation into DNA by DNA polymerase gamma and beta and served as a chain terminator; however, similar incorporation was not detected using other polymerases. The selective inhibition of DNA synthesis in isolated mitochondria by (+)- and (-)-SddCTP suggests a stereospecificity on the mitochondrial uptake of deoxynucleoside triphosphates."

(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11734-11739). The Escherichia coli gene (ppk) encoding PPK has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed (about 100-fold). The gene possesses an open reading frame for 687 amino acids (mass of 80,278 Da). PPK has been purified from overproducing cells after release from attachment to the cell outer membrane; the purified soluble PPK reassociate with cell membrane fractions. About 850 molecules of PPK are found in a wild type cell."
https://openalex.org/W1502124600,"Bovine liver cytosol contains a phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PLCcyt) that is activated by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)-activated G-proteins from liver plasma membranes. Heparin-Sepharose chromatography indicated that PLCcyt was immunologically distinct from PLC-beta 1, PLC-gamma 1, or PLC-delta 1 from brain. Initial purification of the GTP gamma S-activated G-proteins that stimulated PLCcyt indicated that the beta gamma complex was responsible. G-proteins were subsequently extracted from liver membranes as heterotrimers and purified in the presence of AlCl3, MgCl2, and NaF to allow reversible activation. Immunoblot analysis with an antiserum selective for the beta subunit showed that the stimulatory activity corresponded with the presence of this protein at every chromatographic step. When liver beta gamma complex was purified and separated from all detectable alpha subunits, as shown by immunoblotting and silver staining, it strongly stimulated PLCcyt after removal of the activating ligand [AlF4]- by gel filtration. beta gamma prepared from brain was approximately equipotent with that from liver. beta gamma was half-maximally effective at 33 nM and produced a maximal 50-fold activation of the PLC. Under identical conditions, beta gamma had no effect on brain PLC-gamma 1 or PLC-delta 1 and produced a 2-fold stimulation of PLC-beta 1 activity. Addition of purified GDP-bound alpha o, which had no effect by itself, completely reversed the beta gamma activation of PLCcyt, confirming that beta gamma was the active species. These data provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which beta gamma subunits of pertussis toxin-sensitive or -insensitive G-proteins activate phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1514650462,"Membrane association of cytochrome c (cyt c) was monitored by the efficiency of resonance energy transfer from a pyrene-fatty acid containing phospholipid derivative (1-palmitoyl-2[6-(pyren-1-yl)]hexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PPHPC)) to the heme of cyt c. Liposomes consisted of 85 mol% egg phosphatidylcholine (egg PC), 10 mol% cardiolipin, and 5 mol% PPHPC. Cardiolipin was necessary for the membrane binding of cyt c over the pH range studied, from 4 to 7. In accordance with the electrostatic nature of the membrane association of cyt c at neutral pH both 2 mM MgCl2 and 80 mM NaCl dissociated cyt c from the vesicles completely. At neutral pH also adenine nucleotides in millimolar concentrations were able to displace cyt c from liposomes, their efficiency decreasing in the sequence ATP > ADP > AMP. In addition, both CTP and GTP were equally effective as ATP. The detachment of cyt c from liposomes by nucleotides is likely to result from a competition between cardiolipin and the nucleotides for a common binding site in cyt c. When pH was decreased to 4 there was a small yet significant increase in the apparent affinity of cyt c to cardiolipin containing liposomes. Notably, at pH 4 the above nucleotides as well as NaCl and MgCl2 were no longer able to dissociate cyt c and, on the contrary, they slightly enhanced the quenching of pyrene fluorescence by cyt c. The above results do suggest that the membrane association of cyt c at acidic pH was non-ionic and presumably due to hydrogen bonding. The pH-dependent binding of cyt c to membranes was fully reversible. Accordingly, in the presence of sufficient concentrations of either nucleotides or salts rapid detachment and membrane association of cyt c could be induced by varying pH between neutral and acidic values, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1600771445,"Human neutrophils and other phagocytes generate superoxide anion (O2-) as a means of destroying ingested microorganisms. O2- is produced by an NADPH-consuming oxidase composed of membrane and cytosolic components. Activation of the NADPH oxidase is absolutely dependent upon GTP, indicating the requirement for a GTP-binding protein in this process. We have utilized a five-step chromatographic procedure to isolate a GTP-binding protein from human neutrophil cytosol which can stimulate NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free assay. Oxidase enhancing activity was shown to coisolate with this GTP-binding component, which was purified to apparent homogeneity. The GTP-binding protein was identified as Rac 2 by immunological reactivity and amino acid sequencing. Thus, Rac 2 appears to be a third cytosolic component required for human neutrophil NADPH oxidase activation. Recombinant Rac 2 was shown to bind guanine nucleotides in a Mg(2+)-dependent fashion. GDP dissociation rates were determined and shown to be regulated by the free Mg2+ concentration. Rac 2 was found to possess the highest rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of any of the characterized members of the Ras superfamily. The biochemical properties of Rac 2 indicate it is likely to be subject to regulatory cofactors in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2146506131,"Abstract Macrophages express two distinct types of nucleotide (P2 purinergic) receptors for extracellular ATP: one type induces a Ca(2+)-mobilizing response via the activation of phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) while the second type induces the rapid formation of nonselective pores which are permeated by ions and small ( ATP > ATP gamma A; there was no response to other adenine nucleotides or to non-adenine nucleotides. Significantly, the ability of P2z receptor agonists to stimulate this PLD activity was not dependent on the presence of extracellular [Ca2+] or elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+]. The inability of ionomycin, gramicidin, digitonin, UTP, platelet-activating factor, or phorbol ester to quantitatively mimic these nucleotide effects suggested that activation of this PLD by P2z receptor agonists was not a secondary response due to: 1) enhanced Ca2+ influx; 2) membrane depolarization; 3) nonselective permeabilization of the plasma membrane; 4) stimulation of Ca(2+)-mobilizing ATP receptors; 5) stimulation of a primary PI-PLC pathway; or 6) activation of protein kinase C. These findings suggest that activation of a novel PLD-based signaling pathway may play an important role in the modulation of macrophage function by pore-forming P2z receptors for extracellular ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1522178213,"Nanomolar to micromolar ryanodine alters the gating kinetics of the Ca2+ release channel from skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) fused with bilayer lipid membranes (BLM). In the presence of asymmetric CsCl and 100 microM CaCl2 cis, ryanodine (RY) (5-40 nM) activates the channel, increasing the open probability (po; maximum 300% of control) without changing unitary conductance (468 picosiemens (pS)). Statistical analyses of gating kinetics reveal that open and closed dwell times exhibit biexponential distributions and are significantly modified by nanomolar RY. Altered channel gating kinetics with low nanomolar RY is fully reversible and correlates well with binding kinetics of nanomolar [3H]RY with its high affinity site (Kd1 = 0.7 nM) under identical experimental conditions. RY (20-50 nM) induces occasional 1/2 conductance fluctuations which correlate with [3H]RY binding to a second site having lower affinity (Kd2 = 23 nM). RY (5-50 nM) in the presence of 500 mM CsCl significantly enhances Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release from actively loaded SR vesicles. Ryanodine > or = 50 nM stabilizes the channel in a 234-pS subconductance which is not readily reversible. RY (> or = 70 microM) produces a unidirectional transition from the 1/2 to a 1/4 conductance fluctuation, whereas RY > or = 200 microM causes complete closure of the channel. The RY required for stabilizing 1/4 conductance transitions and channel closure do not quantitatively correlate with [3H]RY equilibrium binding constants and is attributed to significant reduction in association kinetics with > 200 nM [3H]RY in the presence of 500 mM CsCl. These results demonstrate that RY stabilizes four discrete states of the SR release channel and supports the existence of multiple interacting RY effector sites on the channel protein."
https://openalex.org/W1832913110,"A soluble form of a mouse class I major histocompatibility antigen (H-2Kb) has been expressed in transfected Drosophila melanogaster cells. These molecules were efficiently secreted (up to 4 mg/liter) as noncovalent heterodimers and purified to homogeneity from cell supernatants. The isolated soluble Kb molecules were devoid of endogenous peptides. Using these molecules, we have characterized the Kb heavy chain-beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) assembly as well as peptide binding in vitro. In detergent-free solution the heavy chains readily re-assembled with beta 2m even in the absence of peptides. Kinetic analyses showed that the peptide binding is rapid and reversible and dependent on the heavy chains being assembled with beta 2m. Likewise, peptide dissociated from Kb molecules without the displacement of beta 2m. Equilibrium binding experiments using various peptides confirmed that octapeptides bind to Kb molecules with the highest affinity and form the most stable complexes. However, in contrast to earlier studies, the amino-terminal positioning of peptide to Kb molecules was more crucial than the carboxyl-terminal positioning and amidation of the peptide carboxylate did not affect the binding. Soluble Kb molecules could selectively bind allele-specific peptides among a mixture of randomly synthesized octapeptides in vitro; however, no dominant residue was observed at the carboxyl terminus of bound peptides. This suggests that the previously observed hydrophobic residues at the carboxyl terminus of peptides may reflect the specificity of enzyme(s) or protein(s) involved in peptide processing in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1501007768,"A specific membrane receptor for plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). When chemically cross-linking RBP to RPE membranes, an 86-kDa RBP.RBP receptor complex is formed, and a 63-kDa protein was identified as the RBP-binding membrane protein (Bavik, C.-O., Eriksson, U., Allen, R., and Peterson, P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14978-14985). To explore in more detail the characteristics of this membrane receptor, we have generated a monoclonal antibody, A52, to the 63-kDa protein (p63). A52 binds the 86-kDa RBP.RBP receptor complex and p63. Several lines of evidence suggest that p63 is not a regular integral membrane protein, and it occurs in different forms. One form is firmly attached to membranes, is part of a high molecular weight complex, and is able to bind RBP. The other form of p63 can be removed from membranes by treatment with an alkaline buffer and is unable to bind RBP. Both forms of p63 contain extensive hydrophobic domains and are found in the detergent phase upon extraction with Triton X-114. The expression of p63 is restricted to RPE, and immunohistochemical localization of tissue sections from bovine retina showed highest expression in the basolateral portion of RPE cells. Immunofluorescence localization, using isolated RPE cells, showed that p63 is exposed on the cell surface of newly isolated RPE cells."

The purified factors did not contain the previously described transcription factor IIA (TFIIA). TFIIA failed to substitute for any purified factor or to stimulate transcription with the complete set of factors, indicating that its function in crude extracts is primarily as an anti-inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1585362347,"The phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of Na+/K(+)-transporting ATPase (Na,K-ATPase) by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) was characterized in purified enzyme preparations of Bufo marinus kidney and duck salt gland and in microsomes of Xenopus oocytes. In addition, we have examined cAMP and phorbol esters, which are stimulators of PKA and PKC, respectively, for their ability to provoke the phosphorylation of alpha-subunits of Na,K-ATPase in homogenates of Xenopus oocytes. In the enzyme from the duct salt gland, phosphorylation by PKA and PKC occurs on serine and threonine residues, whereas in the enzyme from B. marinus kidney and Xenopus oocytes, phosphorylation by PKA occurs only on serine residues. Phosphopeptide analysis indicates that a site phosphorylated by PKA resides in a 12-kDa fragment comprising the C terminus of the polypeptide. Studies of phosphorylation performed on homogenates of Xenopus oocytes show that not only endogenous oocyte Na,K-ATPase but also exogenous Xenopus Na,K-ATPase expressed in the oocyte by microinjection of cRNA can be phosphorylated in response to stimulation of oocyte PKA and PKC. In conclusion, these data are consistent with the possibility that the alpha-subunit of Na,K-ATPase can serve as a substrate for PKA and PKC in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2128633524,"The structures of methanol dehydrogenase (MEDH) from two closely related methylotrophic bacteria, Methylophilus methylotrophus and W3A1, have been determined at 2.6-A resolution. The molecule, a quinoprotein of molecular mass of about 138 kDa, contains two heavy (H) and two light (L) subunits of unknown sequence and two molecules of noncovalently associated pyrroloquinoline quinone. The two enzymes crystallize isomorphously in space group P2(1) with one H2L2 heterotetramer in the asymmetric unit. The electron density map of the M. methylophilus enzyme was obtained by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering and improved by solvent leveling and electron density averaging. For model building, the amino acid sequence of MEDH from Paracoccus denitrificans for the H subunit and from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 for the L subunit were used to represent the unknown amino acid sequence. At the present time, 579 and 57 amino acid residues for the large and small subunits, respectively, have been fitted into the map. The phases for MEDH from M. methylophilus were used directly to analyze the W3A1 structure, and both structures were refined to R-factors (where R = sigma[Fo-Fc[/sigma Fo) of 0.277 and 0.266, respectively. The L subunit contains a long alpha-helix and an extended N-terminal segment, both lying on the molecular surface of the H subunit. The H subunit contains eight antiparallel beta-sheets, each consisting of four strands arranged topologically like the letter W. The eight Ws are arranged circularly, forming the main disc-shaped body of the subunit, with some short helices and loops connecting the consecutive Ws, as well as some excursions within and between some of the Ws. The pyrroloquinoline quinone prosthetic group is located in the central channel of the large subunit near the surface of the molecule. The topology of the eight-W folding unit is similar to those of the six- and seven-W folding units previously reported for three other proteins, neuraminidase, methylamine dehydrogenase, and galactose oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1482032523,"Activated neutrophils undergo a large burst of metabolic acid generation, yet maintain their cytosolic pH (pHi) within physiological limits. To analyze the underlying regulatory mechanisms, pHi was measured fluorimetrically in suspensions of human neutrophils. In acid loaded but otherwise unstimulated cells, pHi recovered rapidly via Na+/H+ exchange. Upon Na+ removal, recovery from an imposed acid load was negligible. Phorbol ester activation of acidified cells induced a rapid recovery of pHi partly due to a Zn(2+)-sensitive H(+)-conductive pathway. A third component of the regulatory response was apparent in Na(+)-free media containing Zn2+. Acid extrusion through this alternate pathway was voltage sensitive and capable of translocating H+ equivalents against their electrochemical gradient. This active H+ transport was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and by nanomolar doses of bafilomycins A1 or B1, suggesting the involvement of vacuolar (V)-type H+ pumps. Cytosolic alkalinization was accompanied by extracellular acidification, indicative of translocation of H+ equivalents across the surface membrane and consistent with the sensitivity of the alkalinization to changes in plasma membrane potential. The activity of the V-type H+ pumps was virtually undetectable in resting cells, becoming apparent only after treatment with phorbol esters or other, chemically unrelated agonists of protein kinase C. These H+ pumps are likely to play a role in pHi homeostasis during the metabolic burst that accompanies neutrophil activation during infection and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2061982109,"T LYMPHOCYTES recognize antigens as peptide fragments associated with molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells1. In the thymus, T cells bearingαβ receptors that react with the MHC molecules expressed by radioresistant stromal elements are positively selected for maturation2–5. In (A × B → A) bone marrow chimaeras, T cells restricted to the MHC-A haplotype are positively selected, whereas MHC-B-reactive thymocytes are not. We investigated whether the introduction of particular thymic stromal elements bearing MHC-B molecules could alter the fate of B-reactive T cells in these (A × B → A) chimaeras. Thymic epithelial cell (TEC) lines expressing H−2b were introduced by intrathymic injection into (H−2b/s → H2S) bone marrow chimaeras and we measured their ability to generate H−2b-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). We report here that one TEC line, 427.1, was able positively to select CTLs specific for influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus antigens in association with class I H−2bmolecules. In addition, line 427.1 can process cytoplasmic proteins for presentation to H−2Kb- and H−2Db-restricted CTLs. Thus, a TEC line capable of normal class I MHC antigen processing and presentation in vitro can induce positive selection after intrathymic injection."
https://openalex.org/W1556347721,"Luminal Ca2+ controls the sensitivity of the intracellular Ca2+ stores to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release is also controlled by cytosolic Ca2+; low concentrations of Ca2+ stimulate the release. The aim of this work was to investigate whether luminal Ca2+ would affect the stimulation of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor by cytosolic Ca2+ in permeabilized A7r5 smooth muscle cells. We also report that the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor in A7r5 cells is activated by low concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ increases the Ins(1,4,5)P3 sensitivity without affecting the cooperativity. The increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 sensitivity becomes relatively more pronounced when the Ca2+ content of the stores decreases. This modulatory effect of luminal Ca2+ on the responsiveness to cytosolic Ca2+ is an intrinsic property of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1618131473,"Recent structure/function studies on human relaxin II have led to the conclusion that the arginines B13 and/or B17 are important for biological activity. These studies have been confirmed and extended with the help of chemically synthesized derivatives, i.e. dicitrulline (B13, B17), two monocitrulline (B13 and B17), a dilysine (B13, 17), and alanine (B17) relaxins. The CD spectra of synthetic human relaxin and of the derivatives are indistinguishable. Yet, only the native human relaxin II is biologically active and binds strongly to relaxin receptor preparations in vitro. The inactivation is strictly due to side chain functions, in particular the replacement of either or both arginines in the positions B13 or B17. Binding is mediated by a two-prong electrostatic and hydrogen-binding interaction via arginines B13 and B17. Neither B13 nor B17 alone are sufficient and a positive charge equidistant from the B chain helix is equally insufficient. This binding mechanism appears to be unique, as concerns hormone receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1588834418,"Several receptors for the extracellular matrix protein collagen have been described which belong to the superfamily of receptors collectively known as integrins. Although several integrins have been shown to interact with extracellular matrix molecules via a common recognition site, arginine-glycine-aspartic Acid (RGD), within the beta 1 integrin subfamily, only the fibronectin receptor (alpha 5 beta 1) has been convincingly shown to interact with RGD. In the present study, we tested whether a collagen receptor could interact with RGD. Adhesion of an osteosarcoma cell line, MG-63, to immobilized collagen I was inhibited by the cyclic RGD-containing peptide, C*GRGDSPC* (where C* indicates that Cys participates in disulfide), and not by the linear GRGDSP or the non-RGD-containing cyclic peptide, C*GKGESPC*. Similarly, using collagen-Sepharose affinity chromatography, a heterodimeric protein could be specifically eluted from the column by the cyclic RGD peptide. Immunoprecipitations of the eluted material with monoclonal antibodies showed reactivity with the collagen receptor alpha 2 beta 1 and not alpha 3 beta 1. Our data demonstrate that RGD peptides can interact with the collagen receptor, and the differences seen with the linear and cyclic peptide suggest that the cyclic C*GRGDSPC* has a higher avidity for the receptor than the more flexible linear GRGDSP. In this paper, we provide supportive evidence that one possible mode of collagen interaction with alpha 2 beta 1 is via the RGD recognition sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1490343139,"We have analyzed the low temperature EPR spectra of the protein-derived tyrosyl radicals detected upon addition of arachidonic acid or 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl-1-hydroperoxide (PPHP) to prostaglandin H synthase. With either arachidonic acid or PPHP the initial radical detected is a doublet (peak-to-trough = 35 Gauss) that disappears rapidly and is replaced by a broad singlet (peak-to-trough = 30 Gauss) followed by a narrow singlet (peak-to-trough = 26.5 Gauss). The relative amounts of these signals vary with time and concentration of arachidonic acid. The three tyrosyl radical signals were subjected to computer simulation and power saturation analysis. The data establish that there are only two distinct tyrosyl radical species, the doublet and the narrow singlet. The broad singlet seen at intermediate times and at low arachidonic acid concentrations is a composite of the doublet and the narrow singlet. The composition of the broad singlet in incubations of prostaglandin H synthase with 0.5 mM arachidonic acid is approximately 40% doublet and 60% singlet. The broad singlet signal does not represent a distinct tyrosyl radical species."
https://openalex.org/W1574729593,"Proteinase 2A of human rhinovirus serotype 2 (HRV2 2A) was expressed in Escherichia coli and partially purified; the preparation was used to study various enzymatic parameters. Using a 16-amino acid peptide representing the native cleavage region of HRV2 2A, an apparent Km value of 5.4 x 10(-4) mol/liter was determined. A minimum of 9 amino acids (comprising residues P8 to P1') was necessary for cleavage to occur. Proteolysis of substituted peptides was highly tolerant toward changes at P1, P2', and P3' but an absolute requirement for glycine P1' and a high preference for threonine P2 was found. Furthermore, HRV2 2A only cleaved peptide substrates derived from other rhinovirus serotypes and poliovirus that possessed P2 Thr and P1' Gly. Thus, the sequence Thr-X-Gly may form the basis of the cellular cleavage site processed by rhinoviral 2As during viral replication. Studies with various inhibitors support the hypothesis that HRV2 2A belongs to a new class of cysteine proteinases."
https://openalex.org/W1505955249,"A phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase was purified 25,000-fold from the cytosolic fraction of extracts from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The purification consisted of an ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by chromatography on sulfonated-agarose (S-Sepharose), phosphocellulose, threonine-agarose, and quaternary amino (Mono Q), and sulfonated (Mono S) beads. Major contaminants in the purification, Hsc82 and Hsp82 (yeast homologs of the mammalian heat shock protein Hsp90), were eliminated by using a combination of molecular genetics (to construct a null mutation in HSC82), altered growth conditions (to minimize expression from the inducible HSP82 gene), and high ionic strength fractionation conditions (to remove the residual Hsp82). The purified enzyme had an apparent subunit molecular weight of 125,000, much larger than any other well characterized PI-4-kinase reported previously. Like mammalian PI-4-kinases, the yeast enzyme specifically phosphorylated PI on position 4 of the inositol ring and was stimulated by Triton X-100. However, activity was not inhibited by adenosine, a potent inhibitor of certain (type II) mammalian PI-4-kinases. The enzyme displayed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with apparent Km values of 100 microM for ATP and 50 microM for PI. To date, this yeast enzyme is the first soluble PI-4-kinase purified from any source."
https://openalex.org/W1604381538,"Abstract Suicide inactivation of leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase occurs via an irreversible mechanism-based process which is saturable, of pseudo firstorder, and dependent upon catalysis. Data obtained with either recombinant enzyme or enzyme purified from human leukocytes were similar. Apparent binding constants and inactivation rate constants are equivalent, compatible with a single type of substrate-enzyme complex which partitions between two fates, turnover and inactivation. Both catalytic functions are inactivated, consistent with an overlapping active site for this bifunctional enzyme. The partition ratio (turnover/inactivation) for the LTA4-enzyme complex is 129 +/- 16 for LTA4 hydrolase activity and 124 +/- 10 for aminopeptidase activity. The pH dependence for turnover and inactivation are indistinguishable with a maximum at pH 8. L-Proline p-nitroanilide, a weak substrate with a high Km for the aminopeptidase affords only partial protection against inactivation by LTA4. However, two potent competitive inhibitors, bestatin and captopril, protect both catalytic processes from inactivation, consistent with an active-site specificity for the suicide event. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry indicates that the molecular weight of pure recombinant enzyme is 69,399 +/- 4 and that covalent modification accompanies catalysis, producing an LTA4:enzyme adduct with a molecular weight 69,717 +/- 4 and a 1:1 stoichiometry. In agreement with kinetic data, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry shows that bestatin inhibits the covalent modification of enzyme by LTA4 and that the extent of modification is proportional to the loss of enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1631080589,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity has been detected in immune complexes with active protein tyrosine kinases, and its products have been measured in intact cells in response to growth stimuli. Both methods do not directly evaluate whole cell PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity. We have developed a sensitive method to measure PI 3-kinase activity in diluted, detergent-containing whole cell extracts and used this method to determine total, soluble, and membrane-associated PI 3-kinase activity in PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. PDGF stimulation induced a 1.4-fold increase in total Nonidet P-40-extractable PI 3-kinase activity, which occurred within 1 min and was maintained above basal levels at 10 min. At the same time, PI 3-kinase activity in the soluble fraction decreased 30-50%. However, membrane-bound PI 3-kinase activity increased 2.4-fold at 1 min and 3.1-fold at 5 min. Translocation of the p85 PI 3-kinase subunit to the membrane was maximal at 10 min. These results suggest that PDGF-mediated activation of PI 3-kinase in membrane fraction results from initial intrinsic enzymatic activation followed by translocation from the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1537993420,"Cathepsin D is a bilobed lysosomal aspartyl protease that contains one Asn-linked oligosaccharide/lobe. Each lobe also contains protein determinants that serve as recognition domains for binding of UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate residues on lysosomal enzymes. In this study we examined whether the location of the protein recognition domain influences the relative phosphorylation of the amino and carboxyl lobe oligosaccharides. To do this, chimeric proteins containing either amino or carboxyl lobe sequences of cathepsin D substituted into a glycosylated form of the homologous secretory protein pepsinogen were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The amino and carboxyl lobe oligosaccharides were then isolated from the various chimeric proteins and independently analyzed for their mannose 6-phosphate content. This analysis has shown that a phosphotransferase recognition domain located on either lobe of a cathepsin D/glycopepsinogen chimeric molecule is sufficient to allow phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on both lobes. However, phosphorylation of the oligosaccharide on the lobe containing the recognition domain is favored. We also found that the majority of the carboxyl lobe oligosaccharides of cathepsin D acquire two phosphates, whereas the amino lobe oligosaccharides only acquire one phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1507316747,"Catecholamines stimulate proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression in corticotrope cells, but the molecular mechanisms of these effects are not known. While beta-adrenergic receptors stimulate the protein kinase A (PKA) system, the POMC promoter does not have classical cAMP-response elements (CREs). Therefore, we investigated the induction of the c-fos protooncogen, previously shown to increase POMC transcription in AtT20 cells. In this corticotrope-derived cell line, we show that activation of beta-receptors with isoprenaline (Iso) induces a transient rise in c-fos mRNA levels. Gel mobility shift assays with a labeled AP1 consensus sequence (TGACTCA) showed induction of specific binding activity after Iso treatment. Cotransfection experiments with dominant inhibitory PKA mutants and reporter genes containing c-fos promoter sequences showed that c-fos induction by Iso is entirely dependent on a functional PKA activity. Furthermore, we show that beta-receptor induction of c-fos in corticotrophs is mediated by at least two distinct cAMP-responsive sequences. cAMP regulatory element binding (CREB)-dependent induction is observed on the CRE located at -60 bp on the c-fos promoter. A region located in the vicinity of the dyad symetry element (-290) is also found to mediate tissue-specific cAMP induction. Transcriptional activation by this site, although sensitive to PKA antagonism, is not blocked by CREB mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1597212188,"1-Methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium (MPDP+), a metabolic product of the nigrostriatal toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), has been shown to generate superoxide radicals during its autoxidation process. The generation of superoxide radicals was detected as a 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO).O2- spin adduct by spin trapping in combination with EPR techniques. The rate of formation of spin adduct was dependent not only on the concentrations of MPDP+ and oxygen but also on the pH of the system. Superoxide dismutase inhibited the spin adduct formation in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of DMPO to trap superoxide radicals, generated during the autoxidation of MPDP+, and of superoxide dismutase to effectively compete with this reaction for the available O2-, has been used as a convenient competition reaction to quantitatively determine various kinetic parameters. Thus, using this technique the rate constant for scavenging of superoxide radical by superoxide dismutase was found to be 7.56 x 10(9) M-1 s-1. The maximum rate of superoxide generation at a fixed spin trap concentration using different amounts of MPDP+ was found to be 4.48 x 10(-10) M s-1. The rate constant (K1) for MPDP+ making superoxide radical was found to be 3.97 x 10(-6) s-1. The secondary order rate constant (KDMPO) for DMPO-trapping superoxide radicals was found to be 10.2 M-1 s-1. The lifetime of superoxide radical at pH 10.0 was calculated to be 1.25 s. These values are in close agreement to the published values obtained using different experimental techniques. These results indicate that superoxide radicals are produced during spontaneous oxidation of MPDP+ and that EPR spin trapping can be used to determine the rate constants and lifetime of free radicals generated in aqueous solutions. It appears likely that the nigrostriatal toxicity of MPTP/MPDP+ leading to Parkinson's disease may largely be due to the reactivity of these radicals."

Transcription activity could be reconstituted after separation of the three polypeptides under denaturing conditions; the 54- and 105-kDa subunits were both essential, while the 30-kDa subunit was slightly stimulatory. Factor g was required for initiation at all promoters tested, including those from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and adenovirus. Factor g can stably associate with RNA polymerase II, as shown by cosedimentation in a glycerol gradient."
https://openalex.org/W1543324954,"The molecular process by which insulin binding to the receptor alpha-subunit induces activation of the receptor beta-subunit with ensuing substrate phosphorylation remains unclear. In this study, we aimed at approaching this molecular mechanism of signal transduction and at delineating the cytoplasmic domains implied in this process. To do this, we used antipeptide antibodies to the following sequences of the receptor beta-subunit: (i) positions 962-972 in the juxtamembrane domain, (ii) positions 1247-1261 at the end of the kinase domain, and (iii) positions 1294-1317 and (iv) positions 1309-1326, both in the receptor C terminus. We have previously shown that insulin binding to its receptor induces a conformational change in the beta-subunit C terminus. Here, we demonstrate that receptor autophosphorylation induces an additional conformational change. This process appears to be distinct from the one produced by ligand binding and can be detected in at least three different beta-subunit regions: the juxtamembrane domain, the kinase domain, and the C terminus. Hence, the cytoplasmic part of the receptor beta-subunit appears to undergo an extended conformational change upon autophosphorylation. By contrast, the insulin-induced change does not affect the juxtamembrane domain 962-972 nor the kinase domain 1247-1261 and may be limited to the receptor C terminus. Further, we show that the hormone-dependent conformational change is maintained in a kinase-deficient receptor due to a mutation at lysine 1018. Therefore, during receptor activation, the ligand-induced change could precede ATP binding and receptor autophosphorylation. We propose that insulin binding leads to a transient receptor form that may allow ATP binding and, subsequently, autophosphorylation. The second conformational change could unmask substrate-binding sites and stabilize the receptor in an active conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1597221290,"We have investigated the nature of a protein domain that is shared among lysosomal hydrolases and is recognized by UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, the initial enzyme in the biosynthesis of mannose 6-phosphate residues. Previously, elements of this recognition domain were identified using a chimeric protein approach. The combined substitution of two regions (amino acids 188-230, particularly lysine 203, and 265-292) from the carboxyl lobe of the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D into the homologous positions of the related secretory protein glycopepsinogen was sufficient to confer recognition by phosphotransferase and subsequent phosphorylation of the oligosaccharides when this chimeric protein was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. (Baranski, T. J., Faust, P. L., and Kornfeld, S. (1990) Cell 63, 281-291). The current study demonstrates that when these two regions are replaced in cathepsin D by the homologous glycopepsinogen amino acids, the resultant chimeric molecule is poorly phosphorylated. However, when either of these regions is substituted individually, the chimeric molecules are well phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of these latter chimeric proteins is dependent on the presence of procathepsin D amino lobe elements. By analyzing a series of chimeric proteins that contain all eight combinations of three consecutive segments of the entire amino lobe of procathepsin D, it was found that multiple regions of the amino lobe of cathepsin D enhance phosphorylation of the chimeric proteins. These elements may be part of an extended carboxyl lobe recognition domain or comprise a second independent recognition domain."
https://openalex.org/W1484971272,"In order to evaluate the possible contribution of phospholipase D (PLD) stimulation to the mitogenic response, a screening of a variety of different compounds, some of which are known to be potent mitogens, was performed using the well characterized Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (CCL39) cell line. In wild type CCL39 cells, or derivatives expressing high levels of either the human M1 muscarinic receptor (Hm1) or the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (39M1-81 and 39ER22 clones, respectively), thrombin, a potent mitogen for all three cell types, elicited the rapid activation of PLD (t1/2 activation, 30 s). Carbachol-mediated activation of the Hm1 receptor in the 39M1-81 clone, which is not a mitogenic signal, produced a similarly rapid although greater activation of PLD. Addition of EGF to the 39ER22 clone was able to provoke both a mitogenic response and stimulate PLD, albeit a comparatively small effect. In each case, the stimulation of PLD correlated closely with the ability to stimulate inositol phospholipid breakdown and was entirely dependent on the activation of protein kinase C. Moreover, the ability of both thrombin and carbachol to stimulate PLD was found to be rapidly desensitized, with a similar time course of desensitization (t1/2 desensitization, 90 s). It has recently been reported that an increase in phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated phosphocholine (PC) hydrolysis by either addition of agonist or by extracellular addition of PC-specific PLC enzyme constitutes a mitogenic signal. In this regard, in addition to stimulation of PLD, thrombin and carbachol were both able to stimulate the activity of a phosphocholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), which did not appear to desensitize within the time course employed. By contrast, EGF was unable to elicit the stimulation of PC-PLC. Ligands such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which bind to and activate receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, are potent mitogens for CCL39 cells but were unable to stimulate either PLD or PC-PLC activity. Furthermore, exogenous addition of purified PC-PLC enzyme, although able to induce a strong and lasting hydrolysis of PC, was unable to produce a mitogenic signal on its own. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the activation of both PLD and PC-PLC is neither sufficient nor required to produce a mitogenic response."
https://openalex.org/W1510824418,"In rabbit peritoneal neutrophils prelabeled with [3H] lyso platelet-activating factor, a protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine (> 1 microM), increased [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PEt) level in the presence of ethanol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, providing evidence for staurosporine activation of phospholipase D (PLD). The staurosporine activation of the enzyme absolutely required both extracellular calcium and cytochalasin B, and was almost completely inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (IAP). In a reconstituted system where the purified Gi1 had been incorporated into phospholipid vesicles, staurosporine activated GTPase activity of Gi1 in a concentration-dependent fashion, with a maximal 4-5-fold effect. ADP-ribosylation by IAP of Gi1 in vesicles significantly suppressed the staurosporine activation. As with the GTPase activity of Gi1, GTPase activities of other purified IAP-sensitive G proteins, such as Gi2 and G(o), were significantly stimulated by staurosporine, but the cholera toxin substrate Gs was appreciably less sensitive to the staurosporine stimulation. The staurosporine activation of GTPase was also observed in rabbit neutrophil membranes from control cells, but not in membranes from IAP-treated neutrophils. From these results, we conclude that the staurosporine activation of PLD in rabbit neutrophils is attributed to the direct activation of an IAP-sensitive G protein in a similar manner to receptors occupied by agonists. By contrast, staurosporine failed to activate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) under the conditions in which it activated PLD, indicating that there exists a PLD activation pathway independent of PI-PLC. Furthermore, it was found that N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase release from the granules of intact neutrophils was evoked by staurosporine to almost the same extent as by fMLP (100 nM), but O2- generation was not affected. These results suggest a possibility that PLD pathway plays an important role in enzyme release, but is not sufficient for O2- generation, in rabbit peritoneal neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1564997571,"Constitutive and inducible transcription of the major histocompatibility class II HLA-DRA gene involves the upstream S element and the conserved X and Y elements. In this report we have addressed the roles of spatial constraints and stereospecific alignment between the upstream S and X elements, and the X and Y elements, in both constitutive and interferon-gamma (gamma-IFN)-induced expression. Analysis of the constitutive expression in B cell lines (B-LCL) has previously shown that the X and Y elements must be stereoaligned. Further study reveals that any spacing changes between S and X, regardless of the helical alignment of these two elements, is not tolerated. These same restraints are involved in an inducible system, because the response to gamma-IFN treatment requires both stereo alignment between the X and Y elements and precise spacing between the S and X elements. Neither constitutive nor inducible expression can be restored by correcting the distance and spacing between only the S and Y elements with misalignment of X. These results reveal a common pathway for constitutive and inducible expression that may require either direct or indirect protein complex formation among proteins bound to three highly conserved regulatory elements. We have also evaluated the role of the A/T-rich sequence located immediately 5' of the Y element and show that it exerts little effect on constitutive and gamma-IFN induced DRA expression."
https://openalex.org/W1908286828,"We investigated the involvement of the p21ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP) in insulin-induced signal transduction. In cells overexpressing the insulin receptor, we did not observe association between GAP and the insulin receptor after insulin treatment nor the phosphorylation of GAP on tyrosine residues. However, after insulin treatment in the presence of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor phenylarsine oxide (PAO), 5-10% of GAP was found to be associated with the insulin receptor, and, in addition, a fraction of total GAP was phosphorylated on tyrosine. Using in vitro binding we showed that the N-terminal part of GAP containing the src-homology domains 2 and 3 (SH2-SH3-SH2 region) is involved in binding to the autophosphorylated insulin receptor beta-chain. In vitro binding between GAP and the autophosphorylated insulin receptor occurred independently of PAO pretreatment. These results suggest that GAP can transiently interact with the insulin receptor after insulin treatment, and this interaction is arrested after PAO pretreatment."

Slowly dividing, confluent cultures produced transferrin with a approximately 4.5-fold greater proportion of biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides than rapidly dividing, subconfluent cultures. The activity of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GlcNAc-T V) and galactosyltransferase were measured in cell extracts from subconfluent and confluent cultures. While the activity of galactosyltransferase remained relatively constant, the activity of GlcNAc-T V was approximately 3.2-fold lower in confluent cultures than in subconfluent cultures. These results suggest that the growth-associated alteration in the oligosaccharides of transferrin is due, at least in part, to the regulation of GlcNAc-T V activity."

(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19879-19886). In order to increase understanding of the control of inositol-1,3,4-trisphosphate kinase activity, the enzyme was highly purified from rat liver by precipitation with polyethylene glycol, MonoQ ion-exchange chromatography, heparin-agarose affinity chromatography, and a novel affinity chromatography procedure that utilized Affi-Gel resin to which InsP6 was coupled (Marecek, J.F., and Prestwich, G.D. (1991) Tetrahedron Lett. 32, 1863-1866). The final purification was about 26,000-fold, with a 6% yield. This final preparation performed both 5- and 6-kinase activities in the ratio of approximately 1:5. The affinity of the enzyme for inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate was 0.04 microM, the highest yet determined for an inositol phosphate kinase. Both inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate were competitive inhibitors of the kinase (Ki values of 2-4 microM). The enzyme was determined to have a molecular mass of 36 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

https://openalex.org/W1659780826,"Abstract We have examined the phosphorylation of Asn-linked oligosaccharides introduced at seven novel sites on human cathepsin D to determine whether the location of an oligosaccharide on a lysosomal enzyme affects its ability to serve as a substrate for UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (phosphotransferase), the enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in the biosynthesis of mannose 6-phosphate residues. The glycosylation sites were introduced into the cathepsin D cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis and were selected to be widely distributed over the surface of the molecule. When the constructs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the oligosaccharides at each glycosylation site were phosphorylated at levels considerably above background (19-70% phosphorylation versus < 0.4% for the secretory protein glycopepsinogen). However, oligosaccharides located closer to the essential components of the phosphotransferase recognition domain (lysine 203 and amino acids 265-292) were phosphorylated better than oligosaccharides located further away. Similar results were obtained for oligosaccharides at homologous sites on a pepsinogen/cathepsin D chimera containing only lysine 203 and residues 265-319 of cathepsin D, although the absolute levels of phosphorylation were lower. These results demonstrate that there is considerable flexibility in the placement of glycosylation sites on cathepsin D in terms of the ability of the oligosaccharides to serve as substrates for phosphotransferase, although oligosaccharides located closer to the phosphotransferase recognition determinant are preferentially phosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W1675628292,"The transcriptional start sites of the endogenous human thrombomodulin (TM) gene and transiently expressed TM promoter/CAT gene constructs were defined by nuclease S1 mapping which showed two closely spaced sites at +1 and +6, respectively. Transient expression and in vitro transcription assays of 5' and internal deletion mutants of the TM promoter/CAT gene constructs reveal that the region from -72 to -29 exhibits a positive acting domain which is essential for transcriptional activity, whereas the region from -373 to -225 possesses two positive acting subdomains, -343 to -277 and -245 to -225, which together augment transcriptional activity by about 40%. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with a duplex oligonucleotide corresponding to -72 to -29 and DNase I footprinting experiments show two specific interaction products which individually or cooperatively protect the DNA sequence from about -60 to -30. These components are essential for TM gene transcription since affinity fractionation of nuclear extracts with a duplex oligonucleotide corresponding to -72 to -29 depletes the above interaction products and specifically inhibits in vitro transcription activity of the promoter, whereas addition of the eluted components specifically restores in vitro transcription activity of the promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with duplex oligonucleotides corresponding to -294 to -215, as well as -373 to -295 and DNase I footprinting experiments show two specific interaction products which individually bind to the two subdomains but not -72 to -29 and protect the coding and noncoding strands from -245 to -225, and the noncoding strand from -337 to -314, respectively. Transient expression studies reveal that the TM promoter construct starting at -51 and including the TATA box is responsive to TNF only in cell lines exhibiting sensitivity of the endogenous receptor gene to cytokine, whereas other promoter constructs possessing a TATA box sequence are insensitive to TNF in all cell types. Based upon the above data, the regulatory events involved in TNF-dependent transcriptional regulation of the TM gene can be defined with the experimental tools and conceptual framework developed by the present investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1537357626,"Previous observations established that pNcollagen III copolymerized with collagen I and decreased the diameter of the fibrils formed (Romanic, A.M., Adachi, E., Kadler, K.E., Hojima, Y., and Prockop, D.J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12703-12709). Here, procollagen I alone or mixtures of procollagen I and pCcollagen I were incubated with procollagen C-proteinase to generate pNcollagen I or mixtures of pNcollagen I and collagen I. The results confirmed previous reports that pNcollagen I assembles into sheet-like structures. They also demonstrated that polymerization of pNcollagen I exhibits a lag period and propagation phase similar to those seen with other protein self-assembly systems. In addition, the results demonstrated that pNcollagen I formed true copolymers with collagen I in that the presence of pNcollagen I increased the lag time, decreased the propagation rate, and increased the concentration of collagen I in solution at equilibrium. Copolymerization of pNcollagen I with collagen I, however, differed in two features from copolymerization of pNcollagen III with collagen I. One was that, in confirmation of previous work, copolymerization of pNcollagen I with collagen I markedly altered the circularity of the fibrils formed. The second difference was that the copolymerization increased the concentration in solution at equilibrium of pNcollagen I whereas copolymerization with collagen I was previously shown to decrease the concentration in solution of pNcollagen III. The increase in concentration in solution of pNcollagen I was explicable either by the assembly of soluble oligomers of pNcollagen I and collagen I, or by subtle changes in the activities of pNcollagen I and collagen I in the solid-phase. Comparison with previous data with pNcollagen III indicated that although pNcollagen I and pNcollagen III copolymerize with collagen I, there are marked differences in the two kinds of copolymers."

Affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column was used to isolate the chimeric protein. After thrombin cleavage, the glutathione S-transferase and the protease were separated by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 column. The overall yield of the protease purification procedure was about 1 mg of protease/liter of culture, and the specific activity was 380 pmol/min.micrograms of enzyme. Like other retroviral proteases, the MMTV enzyme was active as a dimer, showed maximum activity at pH between 4 and 6, and could be inhibited by pepstatin A and a phosphinic acid derivative HIV-1 protease inhibitor. Enzymatic characterization of this protease reveals its broad specificity, showing a clear preference for the oligopeptide substrate mimicking the cleavage site at the amino-terminal end of the capsid protein (kcat/Km = 9725.5 M-1.s-1). The chimeric protein was also an active dimer and showed a similar Km (17 microM) for such an oligopeptide, although its kcat was about 10 times smaller. Autocatalytic processing of the MMTV protease was observed after expression of clones containing the natural cleavage site, as it occurs at the amino-terminal end of the viral protease, instead of the thrombin-sensitive sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1501969175,"Abstract Expression of the Na,K-ATPase alpha and beta subunit genes is influenced by a complex series of regulatory pathways. For example, unequal amounts of subunit mRNAs are detected in several tissues, both at rest and upon mRNA induction, even though equal quantities of subunit proteins exist. We therefore studied mRNA stability and translational efficiency of wild type, deletion mutant, and chimeric subunit mRNAs in a cell-free translation system, to examine the possible role of post-transcriptional events in regulating subunit expression. alpha 1 mRNA translated less efficiently than beta 1 mRNA and competed less efficiently for rate-limiting translation factors. Deletion of the 5'-untranslated region of alpha 1 mRNA significantly increased its translation efficiency. Conversely, the alpha 1 5'-untranslated region impaired translation of beta 1 mRNA when attached upstream of the beta 1 coding sequence. This region is G/C-rich, and has a complex mRNA secondary structure. We propose that differential translational efficiency may contribute to the equal biosynthesis of subunit proteins in those tissues in which subunit mRNAs either exist in unequal amounts or are differentially induced."

Deletion of as little as 12% of the amino acids from the carboxyl terminus resulted in loss of cobalamin binding activity. On the other hand, the receptor binding region of intrinsic factor appears localized to a restricted region in the amino-terminal portion of the protein. Only those transcription/translation fragments of rat or human intrinsic factor tested that contained amino acid residues 25 to 62 (out of 399) showed calcium-dependent binding to isolated kidney brush borders, the shortest sequence corresponding with 20 consecutive amino acids.

https://openalex.org/W1517892915,"The actin-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosins I depends on phosphorylation of their single heavy chains by myosin I heavy chain kinase. Kinase activity is enhanced > 50-fold by autophosphorylation at multiple sites. The rate of kinase autophosphorylation is increased approximately 20-fold by acidic phospholipids independent of the presence of Ca2+ and diglycerides. We show in this paper that Ca(2+)-calmodulin inhibits phospholipid-stimulated autophosphorylation of myosin I heavy chain kinase and hence also inhibits the catalytic activity of unphosphorylated kinase in the presence of phospholipid. Ca(2+)-calmodulin does not inhibit kinase activity in the absence of phospholipid. Micromolar Ca(2+)-calmodulin also inhibits binding of myosin I heavy chain kinase to phospholipid vesicles and purified plasma membranes. Proteolytic removal of a 7-kDa NH2-terminal segment from the 97-kDa kinase prevents binding of both calmodulin and phospholipid; therefore, we propose that they bind to the same or overlapping sites. These data provide a mechanism by which Ca2+ could inhibit the actin-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase activity of the myosin I isozymes in vivo and thus regulate myosin I-dependent motile activities."

Treatment of PT-18 cells with pM 15-[3H]HETE at 4 degrees for 3 h resulted in the cell association of 10% of the ligand: two-thirds was incorporated into cellular lipids and a third was bound to specific 15-HETE cellular binding sites. Binding data analysis indicated a single class of 15-HETE binding sites with a Kd of 162 nM and a Bmax of 7.1 x 10(5) sites/cell. Unlabeled 15-HETE, 12-HETE, and 5,15-diHETE inhibited the binding of 15-[3H]HETE to cells, whereas LTB4 and PGF2 alpha were relatively ineffective. 2.4 microM 15-HETE (unlabeled) prevented 50% 15-[3H]HETE incorporation. Examination of the effects of 15-HETE methyl ester, 12-HETE, 5,15-diHETE, and pertussis toxin on both the 15-HETE-induced 5-lipoxygenase activation and 15-HETE cell association processes indicated a preponderant correlation of this activation process with specific 15-HETE binding rather than 15-HETE incorporation into phospholipids. In addition, 5,15-diHETE itself stimulated the inactive 5-lipoxygenase and eight times more [3H]diHETE was bound to cells than became incorporated into cellular lipids. The results support the involvement of low affinity 15-HETE receptors, rather than 15-HETE incorporation into cellular lipids, in the 15-HETE-induced stimulation of the 5-lipoxygenase in PT-18 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1533405497,"Earlier studies (Periyasamy, S. M., Huang, W.-H., and Askari, A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9878-9885) suggested that Cu2+ and o-phenanthroline induced the formation of cross-linked homodimers between alpha-subunits of the erythrocyte (Na+,K+)-ATPase. This was interpreted as indicating that alpha-subunits existed in close proximity in native erythrocyte membranes. The alpha-subunit and band 3 monomers have similar molecular weights (M(r) approximately 100,000) and exist in the membrane in molar ratios of approximately 1:3000 alpha-subunit:band 3. We explored the possibility that alpha-subunit and band 3 could be induced to form heterodimeric structures in the presence of cross-linking reagents. Using methods similar to those employed in the above-cited reference we demonstrated that cross-linked dimers containing phosphorylated alpha-subunits had proteolytic sensitivity that was inconsistent with the formation of alpha-subunit homodimers and fully consistent with heterodimer formation between alpha-subunit and band 3. The data also indicated that alpha-subunit-band 3 heterodimer formation is dependent on the conformational state of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase. Using the appropriate reagents we obtained cross-linked products which were consistent with heterodimer formation between alpha- and beta-subunits of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase. Our data argue against a close association between pairs of (Na+,K+)-ATPase alpha-subunits in the human red cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1579933901,"To characterize the sulfated proteoglycans (PGs) alterations associated with malignant transformation of epithelial cells in vitro, the localization, charge, size, and composition of cell-associated and secreted sulfated PGs have been compared in rabbit renal proximal-tubule cells in primary culture (Ronco et al., 1990) and in a derived SV-40 transformed cell line (RC.SV1) exhibiting a proximal phenotype and high tumor-inducing ability (Vandewalle et al., 1989). Both normal and transformed cells incorporated PGs into a thick basement membrane layer as shown by ruthenium red staining and immunodetection with a monoclonal antibody raised against the core protein of the bovine basement membrane heparan sulfate-PG (HS-PG). In primary cultures of normal cells, cell-associated PGs were almost identical to those extracted from renal tubule fractions in vivo by their size (Kav = 0.27 vs. 0.26 on Sepharose CL-6B) and composition characterized by the exclusive presence of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG) chains. In addition, the cells secreted a HS-PG with similar biochemical characteristics (Kav = 0.29; 100% HS-GAG chains). The SV-40-transformed RC.SV1 cells also synthesized and secreted a unique PG with the same charge and Kav values and apparently the same core protein (35 kDa) as in nontransformed cells, but three major differences were observed: (i) an increased proportion of PG-associated [35S]sulfate radioactivity released into the culture medium (36 vs. 21%), (ii) the emergence of free GAG chains unincorporated into PGs and detected only in the cell-associated fraction, and (iii) a dramatic change in the composition of GAG chains in which chondroitin sulfate replaced heparan-sulfate. The latter finding is in keeping with the known chondroitin sulfate increase and heparan-sulfate decrease in epithelial tumors. The alterations of PGs observed in this study may play a role in the acquisition and/or maintenance of the malignant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1674769716,"The regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) gene expression by the two major cAMP-dependent protein kinase isozymes was studied in SC115 mouse mammary carcinoma cells using the site-selective cAMP analog approach. SC115 cells expressed both type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme (at a ratio of 2:3), and selective, partial activation of each holoenzyme could be demonstrated in vitro using appropriate combinations of cAMP analogs. When cells were exposed to the same analog combinations, uPA expression was upregulated 2- to 4-fold when either holoenzyme I or holoenzyme II was targeted. For comparison, a high concentration (1 mM) of 8-bromo-cAMP, an analog that does not discriminate between kinase isoforms, up-regulated uPA 10-fold. These findings suggest that there are two pathways of cAMP-dependent regulation of uPA, one mediated by holoenzyme I, the other by holoenzyme II, and that the end result of activation of each pathway is the same. Differences in the mechanism whereby each pathway regulates uPA were searched for but not found. Both pathways were shown to be dependent on catalytically active enzyme, to be potentiated by retinoic acid treatment, and to regulate uPA transcriptionally. The most likely interpretation of these findings is that uPA transcription is mediated solely by the action of the common catalytic subunit, regardless of whether it originated from holoenzyme I or holoenzyme II."
https://openalex.org/W1581702242,"Our recent studies indicate that enzymatic hydrolysis of the intradimer phosphodiester linkage constitutes an early reaction in processing UV light-induced cis-syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in cultured human fibroblasts. Before characterizing the resultant modified dimer sites in cellular DNA, it is necessary to establish experimental conditions that can distinguish backbone-nicked from intact dimers. We thus constructed a model substrate, i.e. p(dT) 10 p(dT)10 containing a dimer with a ruptured sugar-phosphate bond, and determined the products of its reaction with snake venom phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase, an enzymatic digestion mixture known to release dimers from UV-treated poly(dA).poly(dT) within trinucleotides with the photoproduct intact at the 3‘-end (d-TpT T). The model substrate was prepared by (i) end labeling p(dT)9 using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and [3H]thymine-labeled TTP; and (ii) annealing the chromatographically purified p(dT)10 oligomers to poly(dA) followed by UV (290 nm)-induced ligation. Photoligated 20-mers with one radioactive and modified internal dimer were isolated and enzymatically digested. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the reaction products revealed a novel trithymidylate with its backbone severed at the 3‘-terminus (d-TpT dT), demonstrating that this procedure could discriminate between intact and modified dimers. The procedure was then exploited to show that (i) Escherichia coli DNA photolyase can monomerize, albeit inefficiently, backbone-ruptured dimers; and (ii) phage T4 polynucleotide kinase can catalyze the phosphorylation of d-TpT dT, thus facilitating the development of a sensitive postlabeling assay suitable for modified dimer detection under biologically relevant conditions."
