Killing the tissue by heating to 80° C. abolishes this effect. The addition to the medium of sodium fluoride (M/20 or M/40), or of sodium cyanide (M/500) also completely inhibits the disappearance of fatty acids. Sodium azide (M/ 1,000) had no inhibiting effect. The most marked decrease in the fat content of the medium was obtained with adipose tissue and blood of rats starved to 25 per cent loss of weight. With fat-laden adipose tissue of normal rats the effect was negligible or absent. No decrease in the fat content of the blood was found when the incubation was carried out at room temperature. The accompanying table summarizes these results."

https://openalex.org/W1993240381,"THE preliminary communication of Lehmann1 on the treatment of human tuberculosis with p-amino-salicylic acid led us to undertake a detailed study of this acid. p-Aminosalicylic acid2 is obtained by the reduction of p-nitrosalicylic acid, which itself can be prepared by a variety of methods3. These methods are uniformly laborious and we have consequently investigated alternative methods for its preparation. We find that direct carboxylation of m-aminophenol, using modified Kolbe conditions, gives p-aminosalicylic acid and not p-hydroxyanthranilic acid4."
https://openalex.org/W2021548130,"WE have found it instructive to reverse the normal microscope procedure in the examination of nuclear emulsions ; invert the plate, feed light in through the cover slip, and observe through the backing plate. With high magnification, normal objectives and ordinary glass-backed gelatine, this is not possible ; but it may be done by using a reflecting microscope1. In this way, with oil immersion, we observed several multiple stars, and found heavy fragments which were not visible by the normal mode of examination because they were obscured by the central body of the star. In some doubtful cases, this mode of examination proved decisive in the interpretation of the event."

It was known from very incomplete information that experimental cells of this material were made in Germany during the War3 and showed some response as far as 5·8 µ, that is, considerably farther than lead selenide. However, no information was available to us on the method of preparation, nor on their performance, and it may be presumed that the absolute sensitivity was poor, in view of the widespread use in Germany of the lead sulphide cell in spite of its restriction to wave-lengths shorter than 3 µ."

If individual particles of toxic compounds could be coated with substances digestible only by certain insects, then obviously only those insects would be killed by such coated insecticides."
https://openalex.org/W2061092421,"Caspersson and Schultz1,2 have claimed that the presence of an extra Y-chromosome in the female Drosophila is correlated with an abnormally high concentration of ribose nucleic acid or allied substances containing the pyrimidine ring in the cytoplasm of oocytes. Their graph, based on quantitative determinations of ultra-violet light absorption, indicates that XXY oocytes contain about 40 per cent more ribose nucleic acid than do XX oocytes. If confirmed, this claim would be evidence for the control exercised by heterochromatin over the synthesis of ribose nucleic acid : and since this substance seems to be closely associated with protein synthesis, the argument might be extended to include a specific connexion between heterochromatin and growth-rate determination."

https://openalex.org/W2031112290,"THE occurrence of glioma in the brain of the fowl was reported by Belmonte1 (one case) and by Jackson2 (two cases). Later, Jungherr and Wolf3 studied two cases and concluded that the tumours were astrocytomas. During the past twelve years I have had the opportunity of studying some fifty cases of the disease from material submitted by Prof. D. Coles of this Institute."

https://openalex.org/W2015412930,"THOUGH the brain of the young Australopithecus is about 500 c.c. and that of the adult perhaps 600 c.c. or more, the brain of the type Plesianthropus about 450 c.c, and of the beautiful female skull about 415 c.c, it has been suspected that some male brains may have been very much larger. The Kromdraai skull has a brain that we estimated may have been about 650 c.c. ; but with little more than the temporal bone and the middle line as evidence the determination is not as convincing as one would like."

https://openalex.org/W2026200862,"THE elegant brominating reagent, N-bromo-succinimide, has been employed by Karrer1 to prepare fcisdehydrolycopene from the acyclic carot-enoid, lycopene. It has now been shown that the cyclic compound β-ionone reacts in a facile manner with this reagent, giving a bromo-derivative which on dehydrobromination with diethylaniline yields dehydro-β-ionone (I), b.p. 75° at 1 mm. mercury pressure, n22D 1.5497. The absorption spectrum exhibited maxima at 2210 A. and 3380 A. (e = 7,000 and 9,000 respectively). The product was characterized by the formation of a semicarbazone (m.p. 144–146°) and a 2 : 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (m.p. 150–151°)."

https://openalex.org/W1969549294,We now recognize two forms of adsorption : that in which the dispersive forces alone are operative—the so-called van der Waals or physical adsorption—and adsorption in which an electron switch has taken place between adsorbent and adsorbate—chemi-sorption. It is important to obtain criteria for distinguishing between these two forms so that we can identify the type or types involved in any particular case of heterogeneous catalysis.

https://openalex.org/W2032291074,"DUCHESNE has criticized1, from a theoretical point of view, the use in our work2 of the fact that the Raman spectrum of a mixture of α-chloroacids consists of a superposition of the spectra of the constituents. He believes that the Raman spectra of the pure α-chloroacids which we reproduced include some characteristic features which he considers indicate association ; in these conditions, Duchesne writes, the additivity of the spectra for a mixture is an unjustifiable assumption."
https://openalex.org/W2052203458,"THE study of penicillin resistance is interesting particularly if observations are made on the usual substratum of the bacteria, that is, in the optimum conditions of life. Basing my work on the observation of C. Gorini1 that the colonies of his cocci inoculated is agar broth with milk form around each colony a transparent zone due to proteolysis that has dissolved the casein, I carried out tests by the following method: the Petri plates, containing 15 ml. of melted agar broth flooded with 20 per cent of milk, were inoculated with 1 ml. of a 48-hour milk-culture of the stock in question. Holes were made on the slides, as is done in routine testing of penicillin, and in each was put a drop of serial dilutions of crystallized sodium penicillin C.S.C. The method proved simple, quick and very sensitive. The zones of inhibition showed themselves as cloudy circles where the casein had not been proteolysed, whereas the rest of the plate became clear, the vitality of the bacteria there being shown by their proteolytic power."
https://openalex.org/W2079172192,"THE nicotinic acid was determined in blood from the umbilical cord, and in blood taken from the mother at the time of birth. The cord blood was obtained by allowing the placentai end of the cord to drain into a centrifuge tube containing a mixture of ammonium and potassium oxalates, and the blood was mixed with the oxalates as gently as possible to prevent haemolysis. The maternal blood was taken from the antecubital vein a few minutes later and mixed with the oxalates in a similar way. The cells were separated by centrifuging the blood for 45 min. at 3,000 r.p.m. and the nicotinic acid was determined in the cell mass by the method of Klein, Perlzweig and Handler1."

Unfortunately, there was no time for a general discussion at the end of the papers."
https://openalex.org/W4246961415,"THERE has been established at Rutgers University, in New Jersey, a museum for the collection, preservation and study of the proteins of the blood and other tissues of the bodies of organisms, in the belief that such proteins are as characteristic as other constituents and are as worthy of preservation and comparison as skins and skeletons. The establishment of the Serological Museum is a logical consequence of the studies in systematic serology which have been conducted at Rutgers University since 1925, by Dr. Alan Boyden and his students and colleagues. Dr. Boyden has himself collected many representative samples of the blood sera of animals from laboratories in the United States and Great Britain, and others have been contributed by institutions and individuals ; in recent years lyophilized (frozen and dried) samples of animal sera or of the purified fractions of such sera have been contributed by industrial laboratories. The principal objectives of the Serological Museum will be to preserve representative sera or other proteins of organisms and to study the means of improving methods of preservation ; to build up a collection of sera and other proteins of as many kinds of organisms as possible ; to share the samples collected with competent workers ; and to study the methods used in systematic serology. Although the sera of hundreds of species of animals have already been collected, no group of animals is as yet adequately represented in the collection. The sera of many kinds of animals—vertebrate and invertebrate—are still needed. The growth of this Museum and its capacity for service will depend largely on co-operative efforts by many individuals and institutions. Those interested in the subject are invited to correspond with Dr. Alan Boyden, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, U.S.A."
