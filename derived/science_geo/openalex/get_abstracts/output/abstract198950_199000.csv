https://openalex.org/W1992813875,"LIGHT microscope studies1–4 have long established that the sensory unit (chordotonal sensillum or stiftführendes Organ) of the insect ear consists of three cells, namely, the bipolar neuron, the axon of which runs directly to the central nervous system, the sheath cell, which surrounds the dendrite of the neuron, and the attachment cell, which appears to anchor the whole assembly to the ear-drum. The approximate topographical arrangement of these cells and their inclusions are shown in Fig. 1. Examination of fresh material with the phase-contrast microscope by one of us (E. G. G.) has demonstrated that, though the vacuole (v) is a fixation artefact, the scolopale and the axial fibre are distinguishable in vivo. It is with the fine structure of the latter that this communication is principally concerned. All material has been taken from the auditory ganglia of adult female locusts (Locusta migratoria migratorioides) and fixed with 1 per cent osmium tetroxide buffered at plEL 7.4 with veronal acetate. Each ganglion contains about eighty sensory units of the type described."

https://openalex.org/W1965391004,"DURING an investigation of the influence of increased functional activity on the ribonueleic acid in neurosecretory cells of the supra-optic nucleus of the rat, an observation of more general interest was made. The amount of ribonueleic acid in the cell bodies was measured microchemically1 and the volumes of their nucleoli were determined on stained slides. Cells from control animals were investigated as well as from animals that had been subjected to administration of sodium chloride for two months. Apart from the finding that increased functional load (increased hormone production) gives rise to statistically significant increases in amounts of ribonucleic acid and nucleolar volumes, it was found that the ribonucleic acid content per cell body was directly proportional to the nucleolar volume (Fig. 1). The ribonucleic acid content per cell body nearly equals that of the cytoplasm in these cells, so it is apparent that there is a proportionality between nucleolar volume and cytoplasmatic content of ribonucleic acid. On the other hand, it can be shown that it is unlikely that proportionality between nucleolar volume and nucleolar amount of ribonucleic acid should exist as well as proportionality between nucleolar and cytoplasmatic amounts of ribonucleic acid."

The case was explained as the homozygous form of a partially deleted Rh chromosome, designated D − −. Since then several examples of this chromosome have been reported, and further other partial deletions have been found2."

Time-related changes in association between large molecules, which give rise to altered solubility and tensile strength (often associated with increased order), are well known to polymer chemists. It is suggested here that biological systems which rely on controlled intermittent association between specific macromolecules may, by increasingly long periods of association, become fixed in an irreversible or very slowly reversible state, resulting in impaired or lost function."

https://openalex.org/W2060615718,"SUDAN black B, in spite of being the most specific and vigorous dye for the demonstration of lipids in tissue sections1,2, has its limitations3,4. The cell inclusion believed to be lipid may not be coloured with sudan black B, because: (1) some lipids (like phospholipids) may escape from the tissue into the fixative by the process of emulsification2,3; (2) the lipids present have a high melting point and thus remain ‘solid’ in tissue sections3; or (3) the lipids present are ‘masked’ by proteins or other substances."
https://openalex.org/W2044281776,"THE housefly Musca domestica vicina Macq., which has been reared in our laboratory for four years with a modified NAIDM medium1, was used in these experiments. Eggs were collected from oviposition dishes, washed and sterilized. The most satisfactory sterilizing solution and technique were as follows. Modified Vanderzant's solution2 was prepared, with the omission of sodium glycocholate and less mercuric chloride (0.15 gm. instead of 0.25 gm.). Instead of a single treatment, the eggs were submerged in the solution twice, each for 10 min., with an interval of 1 hr. between the two treatments. After each treatment, the eggs were rinsed with bacteriologically sterile water. Plating on common bacteriological medium revealed that the percentage of contamination was less than 10 per cent and the percentage of eggs hatched was more than 50 per cent3."

Other metal ions are ineffective, and the catalytic action of copper can be suppressed by various chelating agents2. The experiments were carried out at room temperature in a barbiturate milieu at pH 8.0 and lasted for more than four weeks. Change in concentration of parathion with a modified polarographic method was followed, and this permitted the estimation of parathion and simultaneously of the p-nitrophenol formed. In certain instances however, in solutions not containing the catalyst, a significant decrease of the polarographic wave of parathion was observed though the corresponding appearance of p-nitrophenol was not detected. Although in publications dealing with the degradation of parathion4 there is no allusion to the possibility of a spontaneous reduction, I have shown it to be induced by light."

https://openalex.org/W2014327810,"THE observation of an unknown iodinated compound as a regular constituent of plasma and thyroid tissue of mice and rats1–3 led to the discovery of 3-5 : 3′-triiodo-L-thyronine4–7. It has been established that triiodothyronine possesses all the thyroid hormone qualities of thyroxine when tested in a large number of species8 and is more potent than thyroxine when tested by a variety of methods in vivo in mammals and amphibians9. Thus triiodothyronine has come to be recognized as being of physiological importance in laboratory mammals and man. However, little is known of the distribution of triiodothyronine in other classes of vertebrates, beyond the fact that it has been found in reptiles10. It seemed of interest to ascertain whether birds have the capacity to synthesize this compound."

Because of toxic hazards it is not used as a spray or dust but is applied via the soil at the rate of approximately 0.5 gm. active ingredient in 120 ml. water per plant or hill. A single application is normally made each season in May or June."

https://openalex.org/W1979437212,"PREVIOUS measurements of the heat produced by ultrasonic waves in a trap vessel1 gave results that differed from those obtained by other methods2 for the absorption coefficients in carbon disulphide, xylene and kerosene, the last two appear to have abnormally high values, particularly from measurements with narrow trap vessels. The results were confirmed with trap vessels made of plaster of Paris, with windows of thin paper or ‘Cellophane’ in place of mica. The abnormal behaviour cannot, therefore, be attributed to any electrical effect in the metallic core of the trap, or to the mica windows."
https://openalex.org/W1993659674,"IN recent discussions concerning the clock paradox, biological time is mentioned but dismissed as of little consequence in the matter1. Contrary to this view and regardless of the solution finally found acceptable in the clock paradox, the entire problem really centres in biological time. Whether we accept or reject a completely mechanistic view of protoplasmic processes and therein compare them to an actual clock in the sense of their mechanical workings, or believe in other processes, in addition to the mechanistic view, the statement that biological time is the centre of the matter still holds. No one has ever shown that biological processes are identical in their functional attributes to the mechanical universe envisaged by the physicists. If biological time is not identical to the physicists' time then asymmetrical ageing is meaningless, so far as biological phenomena are concerned. One of the most outstanding physicists, upon analysing the meaning of life, gives an opposite view. Schrodinger2 states: “from all that we have learnt about the structure of living matter we must be prepared to find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics”. I take it from this statement, and my own experience of more than twenty-five years of working with living materials, that the laws which control protoplasm are of a different order of integration from those of ordinary physics. This is not surprising in view of its functional complexity."
https://openalex.org/W1999972277,"IN hyperthyroidism a decreased glucose tolerance with a diabetic-like glycaemic curve has been found by some authors1–3. Some of them ascribe this change to the damage caused to the pancreas by the toxic effect of thyroxine on β-cells of Langerhans islets4,5, others to the relative or absolute insulin deficiency1. However, Amatuzio et al.
6,7, in their studies on patients with hyperthyroidism, showed that both the rate of disappearance of glucose during the intravenous glucose tolerance test and the glucose tolerance are normal or increased. This observation has been confirmed by my own studies on patients and experimental animals8. Recently, Conn and Fajans9,10 have suggested the use of the cortisone–glucose tolerance test for investigating the latent insufficiency of insulin secretion in the non-diabetic relatives of known diabetics. Since the rapid intravenous glucose tolerance test in animals with hyperthyroidism was within the normal range8, the cortisone–glucose tolerance test was employed for ascertaining the latent damage to the pancreas."
