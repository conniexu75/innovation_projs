This fluid was freshly prepared each day and kept in tightly stoppered vessels. Unlike that of Hammond, the pH was about 7.0; but this rapidly rose to 7.8 during measurement with a glass electrode or when exposed in shallow vessels, and the change was attributed to loss of carbon dioxide contained in the egg white. Since ova failed to differentiate at a pH greater than 7.7, Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate2 (pH 7.4), with 10 γ/ml. penicillin and streptomycin, was adopted as the standard saline medium. With the addition of 1 per cent fresh thin egg white, this proved an excellent culture medium for the ova, but no growth was obtained in the Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate alone."

https://openalex.org/W2019447660,"IT has been known for many years that the ingestion by hens of malvaceous plants or crude fats derived from such plants gives rise to pink ‘whites’ in stored eggs1. Schaible and Bandemer2 showed that the pink discoloration was caused by iron diffusing from the yolk and chelating with the conalbumin of the white. The disorder is accompanied by a putty-like condition of the yolks when the eggs are cold, and affected yolks have a higher water content than normal. The pH values of the yolk and white, normally 6.5 and 9.0 respectively, tend to converge. Schaible and Bandemer2 suggested that the effects of a diet containing malvaceous products could be explained by an increased permeability of the vitelline membrane surrounding the yolk."

https://openalex.org/W1999333812,"WE wish to report the separation by paper chromatography of a number of steroid glucuronosides and sulphates. The composition of the three systems reported and the conjugates used are given in Table 1, together with the R F values noted in a representative experiment. 10–50 gamma amounts of the free acids or their sodium salts in methanol were spotted on 22½-in. lengths of Whatman No. 1 paper and, after equilibration overnight at room temperature in paper-lined glass tanks, the mobile phase was added to the trough and descending chromatography was carried out for periods of 4–8 hr. Following chromatography, the papers were dried ih a current of air at room temperature, and the conjugates were detected by spraying with, or dipping in, 2–4 per cent phosphomolybdic acid in absolute ethanol followed by heating at 90°–100° C. for 5 min. Conjugate 2 was also detected by dipping in 15 per cent aqueous phosphoric acid, followed by heating at 90° C. for 20 min. and examination under ultra-violet light1, or by dipping in a triphenyltetrazolium chloride reagent prepared by combining immediately before use one volume of 2 per cent triphenyltetrazolium chloride in water with four volumes of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide in 60 per cent aqueous methanol."
https://openalex.org/W1977521600,"IT has been pointed out1 that what appears to be a rare, private or family antigen in one population may be fairly frequent in another. For example, the antigen which had sensitized an Amerindian woman so that she lost the child of her ninth pregnancy through erythroblastosis was found in the blood of her husband and of some of her children, but not in the blood of 794 other Amerindians, and it was therefore considered to be rare. However, when tested with the blood of Caucasians, the antibody could be shown just to be anti-Kell, the Kell factor being quite frequent in the Caucasian sample."

https://openalex.org/W2069072001,"SEPARATION of amino-acids and other substances by paper chromatography must often be preceded by the removal of inorganic salts. The common methods1 require careful supervision, and under optimal conditions a loss of 10–20 per cent of many amino-acids may occur with 50 per cent loss of arginine by conversion to ornithine2. A simplified form of desalter, employing ion-exchange membranes, as suggested by Astrup and Stage3, has been used in this Department for the routine preparation of plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid for paper chromatography. The apparatus consists of a small ‘Perspex’ container separated into three compartments by ion-exchange membranes (Fig. 1). The solution to be desalted in the centre compartment (3 ml.) is separated from the anode by an anion exchange membrane (‘Permaplex’ A.10) and from the cathode by a cation membrane (‘Permaplex’ C.10, both obtainable from Permutit, Ltd., London, W.4). The anode and cathode chambers are filled with 0.2 N sodium hydroxide and sulphuric acid respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1966110787,"IN the course of general research into the effect of various drugs on the hæmopoietic system of the guinea pig, it was necessary to observe and record the normal blood picture, since there is considerable variation in the results given by other workers1,2. These records of the normal were primarily obtained to provide a base-line for combined investigations on the reticulo-endothelial system and the blood in relation to the defence mechanism of the body."

https://openalex.org/W2090413821,"THE Carajás Indians of Bananal Island, found by Golden1 to include 51 per cent of persons of group B, are exceptional among South American Indians, who all belong to group O. The late Dr. E. M. da Silva died while working among the Carajás. He found the following distribution, in 113 of them: Such an incidence is impossible; but it shows that the Carajás do not possess a high percentage of group B. Golden, as well as da Silva, used slide methods, which are not suitable for testing anæmic people. Last July one of us (P. C. J.) went to the Carajás village and bled sixty-six Indians. The tests were made in our laboratory in Rio de Janeiro for the following blood-group systems: ABO, Rh-Hr, MNS, P, Kell, Duffy, Lutheran and Lewis. The complete results will be published elsewhere, after we have tested larger numbers of people; but two points are of special interest. The first is that all sixty-six Indians tested with anti-A, anti-B and anti-AB sera, by the minimum volume technique, belonged to group O. Using slide tests, we obtained doubtful results with the same bloods. This probably accounts for Golden and da Silva's results. The second point is related to the Duffy system: among fifty-five Indians we found twenty-three Duffy positives. This observation seems important, since it is contrary to the results of Pantin and Junqueira2 among other Brazilian Indians, and it indicates a lower incidence than those obtained by Pantin and Kallsen3, and several others working on North American Indians."

https://openalex.org/W1972353498,"A SIMPLE and rapid paper chromatographic method was required for separating mixtures of isomers of benzene hexachloride. The paper chromatographic method of Moynihan and O'Colla1, further developed by O'Colla2 and Mitchell3, gives a satisfactory separation, but the acetic anhydride, used as the stationary phase, is an unpleasant reagent to handle. The use of ‘Vaseline’-impregnated strips has been previously described for the separation of DDT derivatives4, and there was some evidence that separation of isomers of benzene hexachloride could be achieved by the application of a similar technique5. The method has been adapted as follows."

https://openalex.org/W2014077512,"IN a recent communication, McCullough1 stated that although the snail Bulinus (Pyrgophysa) forskalii was known to be a vector of urinary bilharzia in the Gambia and in Mauritius, there was no direct evidence that it acted in a similar capacity in the Gold Coast; moreover, snails of that species collected in the Gold Coast were wholly resistant to experimental attempts to infect them with the miracidia of the causative organism, Schistosoma haematobium."

https://openalex.org/W2051052851,"ALTHOUGH electron microscope contrast may be increased by the use of objective apertures, accurate focusing in thin-section work is still difficult and, in order to obtain an in-focus picture of a particular field, it is very helpful to find a small dense particle, or a hole in the membrane, on which to focus. An obvious solution to this problem is to distribute small dense particles on the specimen."

However, if the fish is kept stationary by confining it on a white or black background in a glass tube containing running aerated water, its colour responses become abnormal1."

https://openalex.org/W1968310868,"IN an earlier publication1, we have reported that Acetobacter capsulatum N.C.I.B.4943 failed to grow in a yeast extract – glucose medium containing 1 µgm. per ml. of streptomycin sulphate. More recently, we have found that A. capsulatum is sensitive to 1 µgm. per ml. of streptomycin sulphate at pH 4.5 and to 0.01 µgm. per ml. at pH 6.5 during 48 hr. incubation at 25° in the same medium. The effect of pH on antibiotic activity is already well recognized; but the extreme intolerance of A. capsulatum to streptomycin would seem to be unusual and worthy of note."
https://openalex.org/W1992305737,"DURING the course of histochemical investigations on lipides in the adult bovine lens, I observed certain sudanophilic corpuscles which do not appear to have been previously described. These bodies were discovered because of their intense staining with sudan black B (and also with its acetylated derivative1), which was applied to frozen sections of thin lens slices that had been fixed in calcium chloride formol immediately after death. They are to be found in a restricted zone (1 mm. or so wide in the radial direction) which lies 2–3 mm. from the lens equator and extends a few millimetres on either side of the equatorial plane."
