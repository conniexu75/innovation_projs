https://openalex.org/W2050620572,"Inhibin, a specific and potent polypeptide inhibitor of the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), of gonadal origin and thus a potential contraceptive, may constitute a missing link in the mechanism controlling the differential secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins. Inhibin-like bioactivity has been reported in various fluids and extracts of testis and in ovarian follicular fluid. Although there have been several attempts to purify inhibin from seminal plasma, purification from follicular fluid has been more successful (refs 14-16; for review see ref. 17). We have previously isolated two forms (A and B) of inhibin from porcine follicular fluid. Each form comprised two dissimilar subunits of relative molecular mass (Mr) 18,000 (18K, referred to here as the alpha-subunit) and 14K (the beta-subunit), crosslinked by one or more disulphide bridge(s). Forms A and B differ in the N-terminal sequence of their 14K subunit. Preliminary structural characterization of porcine and bovine ovarian inhibins shows that they have similar properties. Here, we have used the N-terminal amino-acid sequence data on the subunits of each inhibin to identify cloned complementary DNAs encoding the biosynthetic precursors and report that inhibins are the product of a gene family that also includes transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and whose structural organization is similar to that of pituitary and placental glycoprotein hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2087890016,"The macrophage has been suggested to be responsible for the connective tissue cell proliferation that accompanies most chronic inflammatory responses. One of the secretory products of activated macrophages is MDGF, a growth factor (or factors) for fibroblasts, 3T3 cells, smooth muscle, and vascular endothelium. This report demonstrates that a significant portion of the mitogenic activity for 3T3 cells secreted by cultured human alveolar and peritoneal macrophages is due to a molecule (or molecules) similar to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Two size classes (approximately 37,000-39,000 and 12,000-17,000 daltons) of mitogenically active PDGF-like molecules are detected by two criteria--antigenic similarity with PDGF and ability to compete with 125I-PDGF for high-affinity binding to the PDGF receptor. The presence of mRNA for the B chain of PDGF is demonstrated by Northern analysis, and de novo synthesis of these molecules by activated macrophages is shown by immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled proteins with anti-PDGF IgG."
https://openalex.org/W2061015788,Steroids that lack glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity were found to inhibit angiogenesis in the presence of heparin or specific heparin fragments. This newly discovered steroid function appears to be governed by distinct structural configurations of the pregnane nucleus. These compounds are here named angiostatic steroids.
https://openalex.org/W2015229379,"Single microtubules from squid axoplasm support bidirectional movement of organelles. We previously purified a microtubule translocator (kinesin) that moves latex beads in only one direction along microtubules. In this study, a polar array of microtubules assembled off of centrosomes in vitro was used to demonstrate that kinesin moves latex beads from the minus to the plus ends of microtubules, a direction that corresponds to anterograde transport in the axon. A crude solubilized fraction from squid axoplasm (S1a), however, generates bidirectional movement of beads along microtubules. Retrograde bead movement (1.4 micron/sec) is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide and 20 microM vanadate while anterograde movement (0.6 micron/sec) is unaffected by these agents. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody against kinesin, when coupled to Sepharose, removes the anterograde, but not the retrograde, bead translocator from S1a. These results indicate that there is a retrograde bead translocator which is pharmacologically and immunologically distinct from kinesin."
https://openalex.org/W2065313571,"The pol gene of Rous sarcoma virus is positioned downstream of the gag gene in a different, briefly overlapping reading frame; nevertheless, the primary translation product of pol is a gag-pol fusion protein. Two mechanisms, ribosomal frameshifting and RNA splicing, have been considered to explain this phenomenon. The frameshifting model is supported by synthesis of both gag protein and gag-pol fusion protein in a cell-free mammalian translation system programmed by a single RNA species that was synthesized from cloned viral DNA with a bacteriophage RNA polymerase. Under these conditions, the ratio of the gag protein to the fusion protein (about 20 to 1) is similar to that previously observed in infected cells, the frameshifting is specific for the gag-pol junction, and it is unaffected by large deletions in gag. In addition, synthesis of the fusion protein is ten times less efficient in an Escherichia coli cell-free translation system and cannot be explained by transcriptional errors or in vitro modification of the RNA. Ribosomal frameshifting may affect production of other proteins in higher eukaryotes, including proteins encoded by several retroviruses and transposable elements."
https://openalex.org/W1989982202,"The growth of various chemically and virally transformed cell types in culture is inhibited when they are in contact with normal cell types. We show that this growth inhibition is contingent on the presence of junctional communication between the normal and transformed cells (heterologous communication), as probed with a 443 dalton microinjected fluorescent tracer. In cell combinations where heterologous communication is weak or absent there is no detectable growth inhibition; the inhibition appears when communication is induced by cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation, and only then. In cell combinations where heterologous communication is spontaneously strong, the growth inhibition is present, but it is abolished when the communication is blocked by retinol or retinoic acid. The cell-to-cell membrane channels of gap junctions are the likely conduits of the signals for this growth control."
https://openalex.org/W2048784760,"Injection of human H-ras protein induces maturation of Xenopus oocytes; that is, progression from prophase to metaphase of meiosis. The oncogenic protein encoded by H-rasval12 is nearly a 100-fold more potent than the protein encoded by the wild-type gene. We do not observe any measurable increase or decrease in cyclic AMP concentration in injected oocytes, and the effects of H-ras protein are only partially blocked by cholera toxin. Our results suggest that not all, if any, of the effects of H-rasval12 protein in this system are mediated by adenylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W2058261722,"We have identified proteins encoded by P transposable elements expressed in transformed Drosophila tissue culture cells. Two proteins have been identified by immunochemical techniques. One, an 87,000 dalton polypeptide, is encoded by a P element mRNA lacking the third (ORF2-ORF3) intervening sequence. The other protein, a 66,000 dalton polypeptide, is encoded by an mRNA that retains the third intron and is found in somatic tissues. Furthermore, tissue culture cell lines expressing the 87,000 dalton polypeptide are able to catalyze both the precise and imprecise excision of a nonautonomous P element. The 87,000 dalton protein is encoded by sequences from all four P element open reading frames. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the 87,000 dalton polypeptide is the P element transposase."
https://openalex.org/W2079588047,"We have isolated cDNA clones encoding the four different forms of mouse myelin basic protein (MBP) and have analyzed the structure of the MBP gene. The three larger forms of MBP differ from the smallest by the inclusion of either or both of two short amino acid sequences at positions 57 and 124 of the smallest protein. The mouse genome contains a single MBP gene comprised of seven exons. The two amino acid sequences present only in the larger MBPs are encoded by separate exons. Furthermore, all exons in the coding region begin or end in complete codons so that alternative splicing does not alter the reading frame. We conclude that the four forms of this myelin protein are encoded in separate mRNAs, each derived by a simple alternative splicing of the primary MBP gene transcript. Comparison of the amino acid sequence encoded by each exon with a recent model of the secondary structure of MBP suggests that each of the seven exons encodes one or two of the predicted structural motifs of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2005037829,"We have examined the DNA regions required for rRNA synthesis in E. coli using promoter-lacZ and lambda PL-rrnB operon fusions. Sequences between -51 and -20 with respect to the P1 promoter transcription initiation site contain the critical information for growth rate dependent control. The region essential for growth rate regulation is the same as that necessary for feedback inhibition. A separate upstream region, between -51 and -88, increases rRNA transcription at least 15-fold and appears to have an abnormal conformation. The box A sequence downstream of promoter P2, but not DNA between P2 and box A, is required for efficient rRNA chain elongation. These results indicate that neither upstream activation nor antitermination determines growth rate dependence. Rather, growth rate regulation takes place at the target site for the negative feedback system, the P1 promoter itself. We propose that negative feedback regulation is responsible for the growth rate dependence of rRNA synthesis in E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W2023512088,"The Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax, and fushi tarazu genes of Drosophila melanogaster each contain a very similar protein coding sequence, the homeo box. Previously cloned homeo box sequences were used to isolate additional well conserved members of the homeo box gene family. The most strongly conserved members of the homeo box gene family map within either the Antennapedia or Bithorax gene complexes. The tissue distribution of transcripts encoded by the two rightmost homeo box genes of the Bithorax complex are compared with the iab-2 and iab-7 phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2043431166,"We have used nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate intermediates in transcription initiation that result from action of E. coli RNA polymerase on the lac UV5 promoter. The resolved gel complexes are characterized by DNAase I footprinting, protein subunit content, RNA content, and transcription ability. There are two ""open"" complexes, whose equilibrium ratio is a function of temperature; they differ in their ability to escape abortive cycling, but not in their DNAase I footprints. We find three ""initiated"" complexes, containing RNA chains at least 11 nucleotides long, and lacking the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase. These experiments provide a detailed view of the early initiation steps and their thermal regulation at the E. coli lac promoter."

https://openalex.org/W1515146661,"Protein kinase C is known to be involved both in initiation and termination of cellular responses due to phosphoinositide breakdown. Here we report that in PC12 cells (a line of neurosecretory cells derived from a rat pheochromocytoma), pretreatment with nanomolar concentrations of phorbol myristate acetate, PMA, which is believed to specifically activate protein kinase C, inhibits the cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration rise induced by depolarizing agents. In contrast, plasma membrane potential and 45Ca efflux from preloaded cells were unaffected by PMA pretreatment. Inhibition by PMA and diacylglycerol of the cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration rise induced by depolarization was observed also in another cell line, the insulin secreting line RINm5F. These results raise the possibility that the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel is under inhibitory control by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1981525963,"A murine homeo box (m6–12) known to be expressed during differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells lies within a cluster of homeo boxes located in 30 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA. We have established the organization of the boxes within this complex, as well as the nucleotide sequence of a second box, m5-4. Similar to the m6–12 box, expression of novel m5-4 transcripts is induced upon differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells. Transcripts of genes containing m6–12 were found in embryonic tissue during almost all stages of prenatal development studied, whereas expression of m5-4 was detected only in 12 day embryonic tissue. Finally, we have described the differential expression of these homeo-box-containing regions in various adult tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2042891873,"The ColE1 primer transcript (RNA II) hybridizes to the template DNA near the replication origin. The hybridized RNA II is cleaved by RNAase H to form the primer. Hybridization is inhibited by binding of another RNA, RNA I, to RNA II. This binding alters the secondary structure of RNA II even in the region far downstream of the segment where RNA I binds. Similar functional and structural alterations of RNA II are produced by a single base-change within this segment. However, a region of about 200 nucleotides proximal to the 5′ end of RNA II that includes the segment can be deleted with little effect on primer formation. By forming an alternative structure, the dispensable region affects folding of a downstream region, and thus participates in regulation of primer formation."
https://openalex.org/W1539968788,"The Streptococcus faecalis H+-ATPase (F1 X F0 complex) level was elevated when the cytoplasmic pH was shifted below 7.5. The elevated level was attained by the increase in functional unit (F1 X F0 complex) in membranes, but not by the activation of the enzyme. Our data strongly suggested that the increase in enzyme arises from stimulation of enzyme biosynthesis. When calls growing at pH 7.6 were transferred to an acid medium with a pH below 7, the amount of H+-ATPase increased. The amount of H+-ATPase decreased to the basal level when the medium was alkalized again. Cytoplasmic pH was not controlled normally in cells where a change in the amount of H+-ATPase was inhibited. Based on these findings and previous data (Kobayashi, H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 72-76), we propose a model for the regulatory mechanism of streptococcal cytoplasmic pH: the pH is regulated by changes in amount and activity of the H+-ATPase, which are dependent on the cytoplasmic pH."

https://openalex.org/W1521871611,"A cDNA clone of a keratin-related, intermediate filament protein, designated Endo B, was constructed from size-fractionated parietal endodermal mRNA and characterized. The 1466-nucleotide cDNA insert contains an open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides that would result in 5' and 3' noncoding sequences of 54 and 60 nucleotides, respectively. The predicted amino acid composition, molecular weight (47,400), and peptide pattern correlate well with data obtained on the isolated protein. The predicted amino acid sequence fits easily into the general domain structure suggested for all intermediate filament proteins with a unique amino-terminal head domain, a large conserved central domain of predominantly alpha-helical structure, and a relatively unique carboxyl-terminal or tail domain. Over the entire molecule, Endo B is 43% identical with human 52-kDa epidermal type I keratin. However, over two of the three regions contained in the central domain that are predicted to form coiled-coil structures, the Endo B is 54-68% identical with other type I keratin sequences. This homology, along with the presence of the completely conserved sequence DNARLAADDFR-KYE, which is found in all type I keratins, permits the unambiguous identification of Endo B as a type I keratin. Comparison of the Endo B sequence to other intermediate filament proteins reveals 22 residues which are identical in all intermediate filament proteins regardless of whether filament formation requires only one type of protein subunit (vimentin, desmin, glial fibrillar acidic protein, or a neurofilament protein) or two dissimilar types (type I and type II keratins). Endo B mRNA was detectable in RNA isolated from F9 cells treated with retinoic acid for 48 h. Approximately three to five genes homologous to Endo B were detected in the mouse genome."
https://openalex.org/W2032379908,"Hybridomas generated from C57BL/6 mice immunized with the hapten NP coupled to ficoll, a T-cell-independent carrier, produce monoclonal antibodies that use a large repertoire of VH regions and light chains. This contrasts with the homogeneity of the strain-specific response to NP observed with T-cell-dependent carriers, where most of the antibodies use a single VH region, V186.2, in combination with the lambda-1 light chain. There is no evidence for somatic mutation in any of the sequenced regions of the antibodies generated by NP-ficoll. Thus T cell participation is required for the homogeneity of the strain-specific hapten response, and probably for somatic mutation as well."

https://openalex.org/W1983754345,"The Dictyostelium discoideum transposon DIRS-1 contains long terminal repeats that are inverted (ITRs) and nonidentical. We show here that the internal sequence contains 4158 nucleotides and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). Two of the ORFs (ORFs 2 and 3) are colinear and overlap for more than 2000 bases. Unusual sequence conservation between the two DIRS-1 elements in the overlap region is discussed. The conserved reading frame (ORF3) contains a 200 amino acid region that bears significant homology to retrovirus reverse transcriptase. Based on this homology, we classify DIRS-1 as a possible retrotransposon and propose a model by which the nearly genomic length 4.5 kb DIRS-1 RNA could be used to generate a genomic DNA copy of DIRS-1 with nonidentical inverted terminal repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1493019391,"Purification of vitronectin by identical procedures from serum instead of plasma results in the coisolation of an additional protein component with mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of 82 kDa. We show that this component is the thrombin-antithrombin III complex based on the following evidence. Similar to a complex constructed using purified thrombin and antithrombin III, the 82-kDa component has a reduced molecular size of 69 kDa if it is not boiled prior to SDS-PAGE. Upon prolonged boiling in SDS it dissociates into 56- and 32-kDa components which co-migrate in SDS-PAGE with purified antithrombin III and thrombin, respectively. The 82- and 56-kDa components react with an antiserum against antithrombin III, and an antiserum prepared against the 82-kDa complex reacts with purified antithrombin III. Thrombin-antithrombin III complex, from either serum or recalcified clotted plasma, bound to vitronectin immobilized on Sepharose or plastic. However, purified antithrombin III which had not reacted with thrombin lacked affinity for vitronectin as did antithrombin III from citrated plasma. Purified antithrombin III acquired affinity for immobilized vitronectin if it was complexed with thrombin or was modified by radioiodination. Binding of vitronectin to antithrombin III coated on plastic was demonstrated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results demonstrate that vitronectin binds thrombin-antithrombin III complexes through a cryptic site in antithrombin III which can be exposed when antithrombin III is radioiodinated, bound to plastic, or complexed with thrombin. Since vitronectin can interact with cells, the binding of vitronectin to the thrombin-antithrombin III complex may serve to facilitate the interaction of this complex with cell surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2036891144,"This report describes the fluorescence hybridization of DNA sequence probes to interphase nuclei in suspension and the quantification of bound probe by dual beam flow cytometry. Nuclear proteins were first cross-linked with dimethylsuberimidate to prevent disintegration of the nuclei during denaturation and hybridization. To demonstrate that in situ hybridization can be performed in suspension, stabilized mouse thymocyte nuclei were hybridized with a probe for mouse satellite DNA sequences. The DNA probes were labeled with 2-acetylaminofluorene. After hybridization, an indirect immunofluorescent labeling procedure was used to visualize the target sequences. With dual beam flow cytometry, both the amount of hybridized probe and the DNA content of individual nuclei were determined. Thus, the specificity of DNA hybridization can be combined with the speed and quantitative analysis provided by flow cytometry."
https://openalex.org/W1528069644,"The Tight Skin (TSK) mouse is a mutant strain that displays connective tissue abnormalities characterized by excessive accumulation of collagen in skin, subcutaneous tissues, and some internal organs such as the heart. Increased collagen biosynthesis by skin organ cultures from affected mice has been previously demonstrated, but the mechanisms responsible have not been identified. In order to examine the molecular alterations responsible for the increased production of this protein, normal and TSK mouse dermal fibroblast cell lines were established, and studies of collagen biosynthesis and expression of Types I and III procollagen genes were performed. Secondary cultures of 5 normal and 5 TSK mice dermal fibroblasts were incubated in media containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid and after labeling with [14C]proline for 72 h the amount of [14C]hydroxyproline synthesized was determined. The results showed that TSK mice dermal fibroblasts produced significantly greater amounts of [14C]hydroxyproline than their normal counterparts (118 +/- 28.3 X 10(-2) versus 53.7 +/- 21.9 X 10(-2) dpm/micrograms of DNA; p less than 0.004). Subsequently, the expression of three procollagen genes in normal and TSK mice fibroblasts was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization of polyadenylated RNA to the human cDNA clones alpha 12, Hf 32, and RJ 5 which are specific probes for transcripts of alpha 1(I), alpha 2(I), and alpha 1(III) procollagen chains, respectively. It was found that TSK mice fibroblasts consistently displayed increased levels (up to 5-fold) of all three collagen transcripts while beta-actin mRNA levels were unchanged. The results demonstrate that TSK mice dermal fibroblasts produce excessive amounts of collagen in culture concomitant with a dramatic increase in the expression of Types I and III procollagen genes."
https://openalex.org/W1486833195,"Acute phase mediators and glucocorticoids increase the synthesis of the acute phase protein alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, also known as orosomucoid, by inducing the hepatic level of its mRNA. Concurrently the acute phase response depresses the hepatic synthesis of albumin and alpha 2u-globulin and their mRNA levels. Present transcriptional studies in isolated liver nuclei demonstrate that turpentine-induced acute phase mediators simultaneously enhance transcription of the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein gene and diminish transcription of albumin and alpha 2u-globulin genes; parallel alterations in the hepatic level of the corresponding mRNAs ensue. The present transcriptional studies also demonstrate that administration of dexamethasone to adrenalectomized rats dramatically elevates the rate of transcription of the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein gene as well as the alpha 2u-globulin and the albumin genes, leading to elevations in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and alpha 2u-globulin hepatic mRNA levels. Thus, hepatic alpha 1-acid glycoprotein mRNA levels are predominantly regulated in vivo at the transcriptional level by glucocorticoids as well as by acute phase mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1560307532,"Two cDNA clones for glycophorin C, a transmembrane glycoprotein of the human erythrocyte which carries the blood group Gerbich antigens, have been isolated from a human reticulocyte cDNA library. The clones were identified with a mixture of 32 oligonucleotide probes (14-mer) which have been synthetized according to the amino acid sequence Asp-Pro-Gly-Met-Ala present in the N-terminal tryptic peptide of the molecule. The primary structure of glycophorin C deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the 460 base-pair insert of the pGCW5 clone indicates that the complete protein is a single polypeptide chain of 128 amino acids clearly organized in three distinct domains. The N-terminal part (residues 1-57, approximately) which is N- and O-glycosylated is connected to a hydrophilic C-terminal domain (residues 82-128, approximately) containing 4 tyrosine residues by a hydrophobic stretch of nonpolar amino acids (residues 58-81, approximately) probably interacting with the membrane lipids and permitting the whole molecule to span the lipid bilayer. Northern blot analysis using a 265-base-pair restriction fragment obtained by DdeI digestion of the inserted DNA shows that the glycophorin C mRNA from human erythroblasts is approximately 1.4 kilobases long and is present in the human fetal liver and the human K562 and HEL cell lines which exhibit erythroid features. The glycophorin C mRNA, however, is absent from adult liver and lymphocytes, indicating that this protein represents a new erythrocyte-specific probe which might be useful to study erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1548187183,"Procedures are described for the selective removal of the beta 1 or the beta 2 subunits from the detergent-solubilized channel from rat brain, and the functional integrity of the resulting protein complex is examined. Treatment of the channel with 1.0 M MgCl2 followed by sedimentation through sucrose gradients results in complete separation of beta 1 from the alpha-beta 2 complex and complete loss of [3H]saxitoxin (STX) binding activity. At intermediate MgCl2 concentrations, the loss of beta 1 and the loss of [3H]STX binding activity are closely correlated. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) quantitatively stabilizes the solubilized complex against both the loss of beta 1 and the loss of [3H]STX binding activity. This indicates that association of the alpha and beta 1 subunits is required to maintain the STX/TTX binding site in a conformation with high affinity for STX and TTX in the detergent-solubilized state. Treatment of the solubilized sodium channel with dithiothreitol in the presence of TTX causes specific release of the beta 2 subunit, without significantly removing beta 1. There is little or no correlation between the amount of beta 2 in the sodium channel complex and the ability of the preparation to bind [3H]STX. We conclude from these studies that the presence of beta 1, but not beta 2, is required for the integrity of the STX/TTX binding site of the solubilized and purified rat brain sodium channel."
https://openalex.org/W2015171436,"The double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent protein kinase is a 100,000-110,000 Mr complex of two interferon-induced subunits each having ATP binding sites: a 48,000 Mr protein (p48) which appears to be responsible for the phosphorylation of a 68,000 Mr protein (p68) in the presence of dsRNA. The p68 subunit once phosphorylated is converted to an active protein kinase capable of phosphorylating exogenous substrates such as the alpha subunit of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2 or calf thymus histone. The phosphorylation of exogenous substrates is highly correlated with the degree of phosphate saturation of p68 and does not require the presence of dsRNA. Both the p68 and the p48 subunits of the protein kinase complex are purified by an immuno-affinity column containing monoclonal antibody specific for the p68 subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2105102387,"Tn10 rarely transposes, primarily because its IS10-encoded transposase protein is synthesized infrequently. Since the 5' end of the transposase gene is immediately adjacent to flanking host sequences, insertion of Tn10 into an actively transcribed operon could conceivably result in dramatically increased transposition. We show here that Tn10 is protected from such fortuitous activation; high levels of transcription from an upstream promoter actually decrease its rate of transposition. Protection operates at two levels. First, externally-initiated transcripts yield only a small amount of additional transposase protein, primarily because of inhibition at a posttranscriptional level. We suggest that the transposase gene start codon is sequestered in an mRNA secondary structure not present in transcripts initiated at the normal promoter. Second, transcription per se across an IS10 terminus inhibits its activity, thus negating any small transposase increase. These observations provide additional evidence that Tn10 has evolved specific mechanisms for keeping its transposition activity low."
https://openalex.org/W1488035272,"Monoclonal antibodies 44D7 and 4F2 inhibited specifically the Na+-dependent Ca2+ fluxes characteristic of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in cardiac and skeletal muscle sarcolemmal vesicles. Preincubation of membrane vesicles with monoclonal antibody 44D7 inhibited 90% of the Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake measured in the first 10 s of the reaction and 50% of that measured after 60 s. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent ATPase activity and ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by sarcolemmal vesicles were not affected by monoclonal antibody 44D7 whereas the Na+-dependent release of accumulated Ca2+ was inhibited. In the presence of the 44D7 antigen isolated from human kidney, monoclonal antibody 44D7 could no longer inhibit Na+-dependent Ca2+ fluxes. The distribution of 4F2 antigenic activity in the isolated muscle membrane fractions correlated with that of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity; cardiac and skeletal muscle sarcolemmal vesicles expressed higher levels of the antigen than skeletal muscle transverse tubule membrane, while no antigen could be detected in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. Our results suggest that monoclonal antibodies 44D7 and 4F2 interact either directly with the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger molecules or with some other protein(s) responsible for the regulation of this activity in the heart and skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1495320977,"Several kinds of tRNA genes of Xenopus laevis are clustered together within tandemly repeated 3.18-kilobase DNA fragments. Other members of these reiterated tRNA gene families are dispersed and irregularly arranged in the genome. Here we report the isolation and some characteristics of one such dispersed gene that codes for a tyrosine tRNA. It is located within a low copy number 9.4-kilobase restriction fragment that contains no other RNA polymerase III gene functional in vitro. The dispersed gene differs from the clustered tyrosine tRNA gene by a single purine transition within the coding region, by extensive sequence differences within the intervening sequence and 5' and 3' flanking regions, and by its approximately 6-fold higher transcriptional activity in homologous S-100 extracts. Analyses of hybrid genes and deletion mutants demonstrate that this differential transcription is due to DNA in the 5' flanking regions."
https://openalex.org/W1527734717,"In vitro translation of poly(A)+ RNA from the uropygial glands of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) generated a 29-kDa protein which cross-reacted with rabbit antibodies prepared against S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase (Kolattukudy, P. E., Rogers, L., and Flurkey, W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem., 260, 10789-10793). A poly(A)+ RNA fraction enriched in this thioesterase mRNA, isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, was used to prepare cDNA which was cloned in Escherichia coli using the plasmid pUC9. Using hybrid-selected translation and colony hybridization, 17 clones were selected which contained the cDNA for S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase. Northern blot analysis showed that the mature mRNA for this thioesterase contained 1350 nucleotides whereas the cloned cDNA inserts contained 1150-1200 base pairs. Five of the 6 clones tested for 5'-sequence had identical sequences, and the three tested for 3'-end showed the same sequence with poly(A) tails. Two clones, pTE1 and pTE3, representing nearly the full length of mRNA, were selected for sequencing. Maxam-Gilbert and Sanger dideoxy chain termination methods were used on the cloned cDNA and on restriction fragments subcloned in M13 in order to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA. The nucleotide sequence showed an open reading frame coding for a peptide of 28.8 kDa. Two peptides isolated from the tryptic digest of the thioesterase purified from the gland showed amino acid sequences which matched with two segments of the sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence. Another segment containing a serine residue showed an amino acid sequence homologous to the active serine-containing segment of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase. Thus, the clones represent cDNA for S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase. The present results constitute the first case of a complete sequence of a thioesterase."

Fifteen clones coding for P-450(15)alpha were identified by duplicate colony hybridization to nick-translated cDNAs synthesized from immunoenriched or depleted poly(A)+ RNA. Recombinant plasmid p 15 alpha-29 contained the largest cDNA (1.6 kilobases) and cross-hybridized strongly with all other clones. cDNAs representing two different transcripts were identified based on restriction map analysis. Clones p 15 alpha-29 and p 15 alpha-15 have identical internal restriction fragments generated by ClaI, BamHI, and StuI digests, but p15 alpha-15 has unique PstI and HindIII sites located within 150 base pairs of each other. This suggests P-450(15)alpha is transcribed from two genes. Northern hybridization of poly(A)+ RNA with nick-translated p15 alpha-29 or p15 alpha-15 showed a single size mRNA of 2.1 kilobases. The level of P-450(15)alpha mRNA was 6.6 times higher in 129/J female than in male mice. The difference between P-450(15)alpha mRNA levels in females and males was positively correlated with P-450(15)alpha protein detected by anti-P-450(15)alpha and testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase activity in microsomes. Sexual dimorphism in hepatic testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase activity is shown to result from differential mRNA regulation in females and males."

During this process, transmembrane channels are formed in the liposomes which permit the entry and escape of small molecules, but not proteins. The channels are stable and persist after DNA injection."
https://openalex.org/W1539520135,"Activated bleomycin appears to have two more oxidizing equivalents than the Fe(III).bleomycin to which it spontaneously decays. Activated bleomycin reacts with NADH and thio-NADH, two-electron reductants, and with KI, a one-electron reductant, to yield Fe(III).bleomycin. The observed stoichiometries were 0.85 +/- 0.07 eq of thio-NADH oxidized or 1.5 +/- 0.25 eq of KI oxidized per mole of activated bleomycin. None of these reactions requires the presence of a redox mediator, as does the reduction of Fe(III).bleomycin by NADH or thio-NADH. The oxidations of both pyridine nucleotide coenzymes and of KI are inhibited by DNA, the usual bleomycin target."
https://openalex.org/W1632246081,"Prekallikrein was purified from human plasma with a final yield of 76% using as the principal step adsorption to immobilized chicken antikallikrein IgY. When purified prekallikrein (3.4 microM) was incubated in the presence of beta-Factor XIIa (0.068 microM) for 5 min at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5, alpha-kallikrein was obtained. Upon prolonged incubation (0.5-28 h), the Mr 52,000 heavy chain of alpha-kallikrein was progressively cleaved, resulting in the formation of beta-kallikrein. The formation of beta-kallikrein was characterized as an autolytic process because it was prevented by specific inhibitors of kallikrein, including aprotinin and antikallikrein antibody but not by corn trypsin inhibitor, an inhibitor specific for beta-Factor XIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1595015767,"To characterize the lipoyl-bearing domain of the dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) component, purified branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex from bovine liver was reductively acylated with [U-14C] alpha-ketoisovalerate in the presence of thiamin pyrophosphate and N-ethylmaleimide. Digestion of the modified complex with increasing concentrations of trypsin sequentially cleaved the E2 polypeptide chain (Mr = 52,000) into five radiolabeled lipoyl-containing fragments in the order of L1 (Mr = 28,000), L2 (Mr = 24,500), L3 (Mr = 21,000), L4 (Mr = 15,000) to L5 (Mr = 14,000) as determined by the autoradiography of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. In addition, a lipoate-free inner E2 core consisting of fragment A (Mr = 26,000) and fragment B (Mr = 22,000) was produced. Fragment A contains the active site for transacylation reaction and fragment B is the subunit-binding domain. Fragment L5 and fragment B were stable and resistant to further tryptic digestion. Mouse antiserum against E2 reacted only with fragments L1, L2, and L3, and did not bind fragments L4, L5, A, and B as judged by immunoblotting analysis. The anti-E2 serum strongly inhibited the overall reaction catalyzed by the complex, but was without effect on the transacylation activity of E2. Measurement of incorporation of [1-14C]isobutyryl groups into the E2 subunit indicated the presence of 1 lipoyl residue/E2 chain. Based on the above data, a model is proposed in which the lipoyl-bearing domain is connected to the inner E2 core via a trypsin-sensitive hinge. The lipoyl-bearing domain contains five consecutive tryptic sites (L1 to L5), with the L1 site in the hinge region, and the L5 site next to the terminal lipoyl-binding sequence. An exposed and antigenic region is located between L1 and L4 tryptic sites of the lipoyl-bearing domain. The region accounts for about 24% of the E2 chain length. Binding of antibodies to this region probably impairs the mobility of the lipoyl-containing polypeptide, resulting in an interruption of the active-site interactions that are necessary for the overall reaction. The lack of antigenicity and resistance to tryptic digestion indicate a highly folded conformation for fragment L5, the limit polypeptide carrying the single lipoyl residue."
https://openalex.org/W1563609283,"Abstract Seminal vesicle secretory protein IV (SVS IV) is perhaps the most abundant protein made by the epithelial cells of the rat seminal vesicle. In this report, we have asked whether the methylation of its gene correlates with its tissue-specific pattern of expression. Using methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases HpaII and AvaI, we could examine seven potential methylation sites in or near the gene. All seven sites were largely unmethylated in the seminal vesicle, while in most nonexpressing organs, all sites were heavily modified. The correlation of demethylation with expression was broken by finding that both ventral prostate and coagulating gland (anterior prostate) DNA showed the same demethylation pattern seen for the seminal vesicle. SVS IV protein has not been reported in either of these two organs, and we could not detect mature SVS IV message in prostate RNA or SVS IV transcription by in vitro incubation of prostate nuclei. We conclude that demethylation of the SVS IV gene accompanies the differentiation of several androgen-dependent sex accessory glands but confirm that demethylation per se is not a sufficient signal to bring about gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1993943161,"Cybrid clones were isolated by fusing mouse embryonal carcinoma (PCC4) cells with cytoplasts of rat myoblastic cells (L6TG X CAPr). Although some clones were similar to PCC4 (Type II), a high proportion (88%) were differentiated; the differentiated cells had a mesh-like arrangement (Type I) or were flat with many projections (Type III). Protein patterns of both Type I and Type III cells changed markedly from that of PCC4 cells. Type III cells lacked alkaline phosphatase and expressed endo A and B proteins predominantly. One Type III clone produced alpha-fetoprotein and plasminogen activator (visceral endoderm-like), while another clone consisted of trophectodermal cell-like giant cells. Therefore it was shown that introduction of the somatic cell cytoplasm induces differentiation of teratocarcinoma stem cells, suggesting a cytoplasmic element (or elements) regulating gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1605892776,"A novel mitochondrial Ca2+ release phenomenon is reported. When rat liver mitochondria (oxidizing succinate) are allowed to accumulate Ca2+ in excess of 40 nmol/mg protein and are then treated with excess EGTA, a fraction of the accumulated cation is rapidly (approximately 1 nmol/s/mg protein) released. The size of the released fraction is an apparent function of the extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration at the time of EGTA addition and can attain a maximal value of approximately 30 nmol/mg protein. Release is inhibited by ruthenium red (I50 approximately 50 pmol/mg protein) and is not dependent on the presence of Na+ or K+ in the medium. During the period of rapid release, O2 consumption is inhibited, membrane potential increases, and apparent H+ accumulation occurs at a ratio of approximately 2H+ per Ca2+ released. It is proposed that this chelator-induced Ca2+ release occurs by reverse uniport with H+ back diffusion to the matrix space providing charge movement compensation."
https://openalex.org/W1487414098,"Histone H1t has been purified from rat testes and antibodies were elicited in rabbits. Immunoblotting studies with anti-histone H1t-IgG have shown that it reacted specifically with histone H1t but not with other histone H1 subtypes, namely H1a, -b, -c, -d, -e and H1O. The anti-histone H1t-IgG also did not react with chicken erythrocyte histone H5. Immunoblotting studies have also revealed that the polyclonal anti-histone H1t-IgG reacted with (a) two polypeptide fragments, NBS-N and NBS-C, derived from N-bromosuccinimide cleavage of histone H1t, (b)two polypeptide fragments, CT-N and CT-C, derived from $\alpha$-chymotrypsinc leavage of histone H1t, and (c) GH1t, globular domain of histone H1t obtained after trypsin cleavage. The indirect immunofluorescence studies on nuclei isolated from adult ratet stes with anti-histone H1t-IgG showed that the fluorescence, particularly, of the pachytene nucleus was the brightest. On the other hand, antihistone H1t-IgG did not stain nuclei from either liver or nuclei isolated fromth e testes of 10-day-old rats."
https://openalex.org/W1545934301,"The variant cell line of H4-II-E-C3 cells derived from the Reuber H-35 hepatoma cells has been established using protein- and lipid-free synthetic medium. This H4-II-E-C3-V line can synthesize and secrete considerable amounts of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin. The addition of 5 X 10(-7) M dexamethasone to the medium stimulated the excretion of AFP without increasing total AFP synthesis, whereas 8.7 X 10(-8) M insulin inhibited the excretion of AFP without a significant inhibition of intracellular AFP synthesis. However, neither dexamethasone nor insulin altered either the cellular or secreted levels of albumin. Cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine and then chased after addition of excess unlabeled methionine. AFP appeared in the medium after 10 min, and 50% of the protein was secreted after 110 min. The rate of secretion of AFP was much slower than that of albumin, 50% of which was secreted after 25 min. Dexamethasone, 5 X 10(-7) M, caused a marked enhancement in the rate of AFP secretion, with 50% released after 75 min. Insulin, 8.7 X 10(-8) M, by contrast, caused a marked delay in AFP secretion with only 20% released after 180 min and then a plateau was approached. Since the intracellular AFP was excreted 55% after 180 min the remaining 25% of newly made AFP was suggested to be degraded during secretion. The kinetics of movement of AFP during secretion and endoglycosidase H treatment of intracellular and secreted AFP suggested that insulin impeded the transport of AFP from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1486059420,"Trp repressor of Escherichia coli K-12 is a dimeric protein (monomer size, 108 amino acids) that acquires high affinity for certain operator targets in double-stranded DNA upon interaction with L-tryptophan. High titer antiserum directed against E. coli Trp repressor protein, elicited in rabbits, was monospecific toward native or denatured Trp repressor. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure antigen-antibody reaction, we found that the binding of L-tryptophan to Trp repressor was associated with a marked decrease in antibody reactivity that presumably accompanied a conformational change in this protein to a state with strong affinity for trp operator-bearing DNA. We analyzed the pattern of cleavage of Trp repressor by chymotrypsin and trypsin and the effect of L-tryptophan on such hydrolytic cleavages. Chymotrypsin cleaved Trp repressor mainly between residues 71 and 72. In the presence of L-tryptophan this cleavage was slowed. The first-order rate constants for chymotryptic digestion of Trp repressor were 7.6 X 10(-2) and 4.6 X 10(-2) min-1 in the absence and presence of L-tryptophan, respectively. Tryptic digestion was more complex. Initial cleavage of Trp repressor occurred with approximately equal facility between residues 69-70 or 84-85. Subsequent tryptic hydrolyses led eventually to a major core fragment containing the first 54 amino acids of Trp repressor plus four other fragments from the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. In the presence of L-tryptophan, cleavage by trypsin between residues 54-55 and 84-85 was retarded, even when a previous hydrolytic event elsewhere in the protein had occurred. Tryptophan had essentially no effect on the tryptic hydrolysis of peptide bond 97-98, but accelerated cleavage at peptide bond 69-70. The first-order rate constants for the first tryptic cleavage of Trp receptor were 1.55 X 10(-1) and 1.33 X 10(-1) min-1 in the absence and presence of ligand, respectively. Our results are compatible with a structural model wherein certain amino acid side chains and peptide bonds of Trp repressor (specifically, those of residues 69-85) lie on or near the surface of the protein. This region of Trp repressor has been predicted to contain the operator recognition site. The susceptibility to proteolytic attack of at least four peptide bonds in this area changes when the protein interacts with L-tryptophan."
