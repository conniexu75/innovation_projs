https://openalex.org/W2079507934,"Treatment of mutant mouse cells (Ltk−) deficient in thymidine kinase with Bam I restriction endonuclease-cleaved HSV-1 DNA results in the appearance of numerous surviving colonies which stably express the tk+ phenotype. Through a series of electrophoretic fractionations in concert with transfection assays, we isolated a 3.4 kb fragment which contains the thymidine kinase gene and which alone is competent in the biochemical transformation of Ltk− cells. In this report, we have examined the distribution of tk sequences in the DNA of several transformed clones following stable gene transfer. A series of complementary experiments involving reassociation kinetics in solution and annealings with tk DNA to restriction-cleaved cellular DNA following electrophoresis and transfer to filters allow us to make the following general conclusions concerning the fate of the tk gene in all clones examined: the tk gene is present in all cells at a frequency of one copy per chromosomal complement; the tk gene is stably integrated in the DNA of all transformants; and integration is not site-specific and occurs at different loci in the DNA of all transformants examined. The existence of a single active tk gene in tk+ transformants now facilitates an analysis of the sequence organization of tk− mutant cells and provides a useful model system for studies on the transfer of cellular genes."

https://openalex.org/W2038287032,"Mutants of SV40 with deletions of various sizes mapping between 0.54 and 0.59 on the genome grow at a rate equal to or slightly slower than that of wild-type virus, in a range of host cells. Their ability, however, to induce transformation in several mouse, rat and rabbit cell lines is impaired. The extent of transformation observed is dependent upon the assay used to measure it, but in general, the ability of the mutants to transform falls as the size of the deletion increases. In addition, rat embryo fibroblasts transformed by deletion mutants have fewer of the characteristics of a fully transformed phenotype (for example, growth in low serum, increased saturation density, growth in semi-solid medium) than those transformed by wild-type virus. During lytic infection, immunoprecipitable T antigen produced by the deletion mutants is of the same size as that seen during infection with wild-type virus, and is present at a similar level. Mutant virus-coded small t protein, however, is reduced in size compared with that from wild-type virus. For each mutant, the reduction in protein size is dependent upon the amount of DNA deleted, but not on the relative position of the deletion in the genome. These results demonstrate that the DNA sequences mapping between 0.54 and 0.59 on the viral genome code for the small t protein, and that SV40-induced transformation is at least partially dependent upon the expression of this protein."

https://openalex.org/W2073429274,"The inherited absence of either adenosine deaminase (ADA) or purine nucleoside phosphorylase is associated with severe immunological impairment. We have developed a cell culture model using a mouse T cell lymphoma to simulate ADA deficiency and to study the relationship between purine salvage enzymes and immune function. 2′-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (deoxyATP) levels have been shown to be greatly elevated in erythrocytes of immunodeficient, ADA-deficient patients, suggesting that deoxyadenosine is the potentially toxic substrate in ADA deficiency. Using a potent ADA inhibitor, we have demonstrated that deoxyadenosine is growth-inhibitory and cytotoxic to S49 cells, and that deoxyATP accumulates in these cells. Cell variants, unable to transport or phosphorylate deoxyadenosine, are much less sensitive to deoxyadenosine, indicating that intracellular phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine is required for the lethal effects. We have partially reversed the cytotoxic effects of deoxyadenosine with deoxycytidine in wild-type cells, but we cannot show any reversal in cell lines lacking deoxycytidine kinase. Adenosine (ado) kinase-deficient cells are extremely resistant to deoxyadenosine in the presence of deoxycytidine. This deoxycytidine reversal of deoxyadenosine toxicity is consistent with an inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by deoxyATP, and we have shown that incubation of S49 cells with deoxyadenosine markedly reduces intracellular levels of deoxyCTP, deoxyGTP and TTP. Kinetics data in wild-type cells and in cell variants are consistent with the presence of two deoxyadenosine-phosphorylating activities — one associated with ado kinase and another associated with deoxycytidine kinase. The S49 cells appear to be a valid model for the simulation of ADA deficiency in cell culture, and from our results, we can suggest administration of deoxycytidine as a pharmacological regimen to circumvent the clinicopathologic symptoms in ADA deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2080035729,"The density but not the affinity of β-adrenergic receptors declined significantly with age in rat pineal gland, corpus striatum, and cerebellum, as determined by the binding of tritiated dihydroalprenolol. Exposing rats to light for 12 hours increased the binding of this radioligand in 3-month-old but not in 24-month-old rats. The reduced responsiveness to catecholamines seen in aging may be due to a decrease in the number of β-adrenergic receptors which, in turn, may be caused by an impaired capacity of receptors in aged animals to adapt to changes in adrenergic neuronal input."

https://openalex.org/W1513161378,"The effects of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist methacholine on affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for isoproterenol and on isoproterenol-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity were assessed in canine myocardium. GTP and guanyl-5‘-yl imidoiphosphate both decreased the affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for isoproterenol without altering the affinity of these receptors for propranolol. Methacholine (10 nM to 10 micronM) antagonized the guanine nucleotide-induced reduction in beta-adrenergic receptor affinity for isoproterenol. This effect of methacholine was reversed by atropine. The choline ester had no effect on the affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for isoproterenol in the absence of guanine nucleotides. Likewise, methacholine had no effect on the affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for propranolol, either in the presence or absence of guanine nucleotides. Methacholine also attenuated GTP-induced activation of adenylate cyclase or isoproterenol-induced activation of the enzyme in the presence of GTP. The effects of methacholine on myocardial adenylate cyclase activity were apparent only in the presence of GTP. These effects were also reversed by atropine. The choline ester had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of guanyl-5‘-yl imidodiphosphate or NaF. The results of the present study suggest that muscarinic cholinergic agonists can regulate both beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase by modulating the effects of GTP."

https://openalex.org/W1552410099,"1. Cytochrome P/450-dependent mixed function oxidations of hexobarbital, phenyramidol, and alprenolol in intact hepatocytes were examined at different steady state oxygen concentrations. Apparent Kmo2 values were determined to be 6.4 +/- 1.7, 3.6 +/- 0.6, and 9.8 +/- 1.2 micronM, respectively. 2. Apparent Kmo2 values for metabolism of hexobarbital and alprenolol by liver microsomes were 4.3 +/- 0.4 and 8.7 +/- 0.7 micronM, similar to the corresponding values for whole cells. Therefore, no detectable gradient of O2 concentration exists between extracellular space and endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes at these oxygen concentrations. 3. Steady state concentrations of ATP, ADP, AMP, lactate, and pyruvate at different steady state oxygen concentrations were used as indicators of mitochondrial oxygen dependence in intact hepatocytes. Half-maximal changes occurred at [O2] = 12.6 micronM for cytoplasmic [NAD+]/[NADH] (estimated from [lactate]/[pyruvate]), at 7.0 micronM for [ATP]/[ADP], and at 2.8 micronM for adenylate energy charge. The apparent cellular respiratory Kmo2 was 1.90 +/- 0.18 micronM. 4. Comparison of values for oxygen dependence of mitochondrial functions in isolated hepatocytes with published values for isolated mitochondria suggests that a substantial intracellular oxygen gradient exists between the outer cellular membrane and the mitochondrial inner membrane at po2 values below the critical O2 tensions."
https://openalex.org/W2061712753,"Simian virus 40 nucleoprotein complexes undergo an ionic strength-dependent structural transition. At moderate ionic strength they contain histone H1 as well as the nucleosomal histones and have a compact conformation with globular subunits 190 angstroms in diameter. At high ionic strength histone H1 is released, and the structure unfolds into chains with an average of 24 nucleosomes. The extended viral chromatin converts to the compact form by the addition of histone H1. Transcriptionally active simian virus 40 chromatin undergoes the same structural transitions. The higher order structure of viral chromatin may be analogous to the compact state of cellular chromatin fibers observed at physiological ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1583060067,"(+/-)-[3H]Epinephrine binds to beta-receptors in calf cerebellar and rat lung membranes in the presence of 1.0 mM pyrocatechol and 1.0 microM phentolamine, with dissociation constants at 4 degrees C of 11 nM and 24 nM, respectively. (+/-)-[3H]Epinephrine associates to equilibrium within 20 min in both tissues, and over 50% of the binding is rapidly dissociable. Inhibition of binding by agonists and antagonists is highly stereoselective, and the structure-activity relationships of adrenergic agents in inhibiting (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine binding suggest an interaction with beta2 type noradrenergic receptors. (-)-Isoproterenol has an apparent Ki of 2 nM, (-)-epinephrine is 1.5 to 3 times weaker, and (-)-norepinephrine is 30 to 60 times weaker. Salbutamol and terbutaline, selective beta2-agonists, are potent inhibitors of binding, as are several nonspecific antagonists. Properties of the sites labeled by (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine in calf cerebellum and rat lung are closely similar. (-)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol binding in calf cerebellum and rat lung also shows beta2 characteristics. Antagonists have similar potencies in inhibiting (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol and (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine binding in both tissues, but agonists are in general more potent inhibitors of (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine. Sodium and lithium selectively lower the affinity of (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine at its binding sites and the affinities of agonists, but not antagonists, at the (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol site. Specific (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine binding was not detectable in calf cortex and rat heart, where (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding suggests a beta1-receptor. A physiological significance of (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine binding is suggested by the strong correlation for agonists and antagonists between affinities in inhibiting binding, and in stimulating or inhibiting a beta-receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase in frog erythrocytes."

Treatment of the cells with indomethacin reversibly prevented the increase in cyclic AMP and the subsequent onset of DNA synthesis. When the heightened cyclic AMP before S phase was maintained by either inhibiting phosphodiesterase or by adding the 8-bromo derivative of cyclic AMP, DNA synthesis was also blocked. Both the increase and decrease in cyclic AMP appear to be required for progression of lymphocytes into the S phase of growth."

https://openalex.org/W1499733109,"The reaction catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase in the reverse direction, i.e. the formation of CTP and phosphocholine from CDP-choline and pyrophosphate, is slightly faster than the reaction in the forward direction. The reverse reaction is optimal at 2 mM pyrophosphate and 6 mM Mg2+, in both fetal and adult preparations. The apparent substrate Km values for phosphocholine, CDP-choline, and pyrophosphate are similar in the fetal and adult forms of the enzyme. The enzyme activity is separated into two forms by gel filtration. The enzyme from adult lung exists as a high molecular weight species, ranging in size from 5 X 10(6) to 50 X 10(6). The enzyme from fetal lung exists as a 190,000 molecular weight species and is totally dependent upon added anionic phospholipid for activity in both the forward and reverse direction. The addition of phosphatidylglycerol gives maximal activity, while phosphatidylinositol or cardiolipin produce about 60 to 70% of the maximal activity. Enzyme activation is accompanied by an aggregation of the enzyme. A sonicated preparation of phosphatidylglycerol is a more efficient activator than a preparation mixed on a Vortex mixer (KA = 30 micronM) and also converts a larger proportion of enzyme from fetal lung into a high molecular weight species. The enzyme from adult lung can be dissociated into a form in fetal lung. The dissociated species can be converted back to a high molecular weight form in the presence of phosphatidylglycerol."

By means of a double-label antibody technique, in which we used fluorescein-labeled antibody to reovirus and rhodamine-labeled antibody to insulin, reovirus antigens were found in β cells. By electron microscopy, viral particles in different stages of morphogenesis were observed in insulin-containing β cells but not glucagon-containing α cells. The infection resulted in destruction of β cells, reduction in the insulin content of the pancreas, and alteration in the host's capacity to respond normally to a glucose tolerance test."
https://openalex.org/W2005591927,"This experiment examined the effects on memory of various amnestic treatments in animals earlier treated with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine (PBZ). Thirty minutes before being trained in a one-trial inhibitory (passive) avoidance task, animals received an injection of PBZ or saline. Immediately after training, each animal received one of the following amnestic treatments: stimulation of the frontal cortex or amygdala, pentylenetetrazol, diethyldithiocarbamate, or cycloheximide. In control animals, each treatment produced retrograde amnesia. However, PBZ-treated animals did not develop amnesia. These findings suggest that there may be a common neurobiological mechanism underlying the amnesias produced by many treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1554144727,The products of the choleragen-catalyzed reaction of NAD+ with guanidine HCl or L-arginine have been isolated by high performance liquid chromatography. Analysis of 1H NMR spectra obtained at 360 MHz establishes the structure of the isolated products to be adenosine diphosphoribosyl guanidiniums present as 1:1 mixtures of alpha and beta anomeric forms. Direct observation of the choleragen-catalyzed reaction of NAD+ with L-arginine by 1H NMR spectroscopy establishes that choleragen synthesizes an alpha anomeric linkage that is subject to subsequent anomerization. The stereospecificity of the reaction provides further evidence that choleragen behaves as an enzyme and may be related mechanistically to other ADP-ribosyltransferases.

Rotaviruses derived from different host species were distinguished by postinfection serum blocking virus activity in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Thirty-three rotavirus isolates from children living in three different parts of the world could not be differentiated by this technique, but they were distinct from four strains recovered from calves, and a series of strains isolated from piglets, foals, monkeys, and infant mice. The four bovine strains were similar, but they could be differentiated from the other animal strains, each of which exhibited a distinct pattern when tested by the ELISA blocking technique."

https://openalex.org/W1556955511,"Filamin is a high molecular weight actin-binding protein found in large quantities in smooth muscle and other non-muscle cells. We have studied the phosphorylation of filamin in a mammalian smooth muscle, the guinea pig vas deferens. Intact vas deferens incorporated [32P]orthophosphate into filamin. Incubation of particulate fractions of vas deferens with [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in 32P-labeling of filamin. Cyclic AMP stimulated this phosphorylation, whereas cyclic GMP and Ca2+ had no effect. Purified vas deferens filamin can be phosphorylated by purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. We have compared cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP effects on phosphorylation in smooth muscle. Cyclic GMP stimulated phosphorylation of two particulate proteins, G-I (Mr = 130,000) a protein previously described by Casnellie, J. E., and Greengard, P. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U.S.A. 71, 1891-1895 and G-III (Mr = 240,000). Both proteins and the kinase responsible for their phosphorylation appear to be membrane-bound. Phosphorylation of both proteins is stimulated by cyclic GMP (Ka = 3 x 10(-8) M), cyclic AMP (Ka = 3 x 10(-7) M), and to a lesser degree by Ca2+. In contrast, filamin phosphorylation is due to a soluble kinase stimulated only by cyclic AMP (Ka = 3 x 10(-7) M) and not by cyclic GMP or Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1493679102,"Abstract Glycoconjugates have been analyzed from a family of closely related mouse cells: a parent clone and three daughter subclones, two of which expressed the simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen. The experimental procedure involved the simultaneous comparison by DEAE-cellulose chromatography of papain-digested macromolecules from the parent, labeled with [3H]glucosamine, and one of the daughter subclones, labeled with [14C]-glucosamine. Three cultures compartments (the medium, the cell surface trypsinate, and the cells) from the paired cell lines were combined at the earliest time during the harvesting of the cells. Heparan sulfate on the surface of cells and secreted into the medium from T-antigen-positive subclones was eluted at lower salt concentrations from the anion exchange column than that from the parent clone. In the viable trypsinized cells a marked reduction of heparan sulfate was detected in the T-antigen-positive subclones. These changes were highly reproducible, were observed during both logarithmic and stationary phase of growth, and neither change was observed in the T-antigen-negative sister subclone. The elution point of heparan sulfate from Sepharose 6B was unaltered. Ratios of 35S to 3H for heparan sulfate obtained from cells doubly labeled with [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine were lower in the T-antigen-positive subclones. Similar changes for the 35S to 3H ratio of chondroitin sulfate were associated with only small alterations in elution from anion exchange columns. Kinetic experiments suggested a reduced rate of incorporation of [35S]sulfate with no change in turnover rate. A substantial portion of the labeled heparan sulfate was associated with the cell surface; in contrast most of the hyaluronic acid and a large proportion of the chondroitin sulfate was apparently secreted. Quantitative changes in hyaluronic acid labeling did not correlate with expression of T-antigen. Glycosaminoglycans left on the dish after detaching cells with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid were nearly completely released by subsequent trypsinization. Cell detachment by trypsinization left an insignificant amount of labeled glycosaminoglycan on the dish surface. The alterations in heparan sulfate metabolism correlated with the expression of T-antigen and with the cells' ability to grow to high densities in monolayer culture, but not with growth in suspension in viscous medium. Tumorigenicity of the subclones was essentially the same as that of the parent clone."
https://openalex.org/W1719783597,"Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) have been isolated and subfractionated on the basis of their differing flotation rates. The procedure consists of a single 45-min zonal ultracentrifugation step using a linear density gradient of d = 1.00 to 1.15 g/ml. Appropriate fractions of the zonal rotor effluent containing the entire VLDL spectrum were characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation, gel filtration chromatography, and complete chemical analysis. Flotation rates of VLDL subspecies from hypertriglyceridemic and normolipemic plasmas correlated directly with their Stokes radii and triglyceride content and inversely with their proportion of cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, phospholipids, and total protein. There was also an inverse correlation of flotation rate with the fraction of tetramethylurea-insoluble protein. This procedure provides a reliable methodology for a rapid isolation of VLDL subfractions and the accurate determination of their flotation rates."
https://openalex.org/W2058245589,"Nucleotide sequences of the ribosome-protected translation initiation sites from the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) M and L protein mRNAs have been determined, completing the sequences of the sites from all the VSV mRNAs. A low level of protection at two internal AUG-containing sites in the N mRNA is also described. Small homologies are evident among some of the sites, but there are no obvious features common to all the sites other than a single AUG codon. In contrast, a large homology between the VSV M mRNA site and the alfalfa mosaic virus coat mRNA site ( Koper-Zwarthoff et al., 1977 Koper-Zwarthoff E.C. Lockard R.E. de Weerd B. Raj-Bhandary U.L. Bol J.F. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 1977 Google Scholar ) is noted. This homology suggests the existence of a common ancestral gene for these two apparently unrelated viruses. For each VSV mRNA species, the smallest sites protected in either the 40S or 80S initiation complexes are identical. These sites always contained the initiation codon, but only contained the capped 5′ end in those mRNAs having the 5′ end near the initiation site. If 40S ribosomes bind to the capped 5′ end, either they do not protect it from nuclease digestion or the protection is only transitory in some VSV mRNAs. Consideration of the structures of the ribosome binding sites suggests that the differential effects of hypertonic shock on translation ( Nuss and Koch, 1976 Nuss D. Koch G. J. Virol. 1976; 17: 283-286 Crossref Google Scholar ) may be related to the distance between the 5′ end of the mRNA and the initiation codon."

https://openalex.org/W2011353165,"We describe the isolation and characterization of a virus-resistant mutant of murine 3T6 cells. The mutant, designated 3T6-VrB2, displays a high degree of resistance to infection by members of the toga-, rhabdo- and picornavirus classes. The level of this resistance to infection is similar to the parent 3T6 pretreated with approximately 100 lU/ml of interferon. Upon co-cultivation of 3T6-VrB2 cells with interferon-sensitive mouse cells, an antiviral state is induced in the latter cells as measured by a reduction of virus yield following infection. The nature of the induction is defined by a series of experiments using anti-mouse interferon antiserum. In the presence of this antiserum, the ability of the mutant to induce an antiviral state in interferon-sensitive mouse cells upon co-cultivation is eliminated. Additionally, growth of the mutant cells in the presence of this antiserum causes a reversal of the virus-resistant phenotype. Our results indicate that 3T6-VrB2 contains a mutation affecting the regulation of the murine interferon system such that the cell is engaged in the semiconstitutive synthesis of interferon."
