https://openalex.org/W2162954233,"The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), which controls childbirth and lactation, receives increasing attention for its effects on social behaviors, but how it reaches central brain regions is still unclear. Here we gained by recombinant viruses selective genetic access to hypothalamic OT neurons to study their connectivity and control their activity by optogenetic means. We found axons of hypothalamic OT neurons in the majority of forebrain regions, including the central amygdala (CeA), a structure critically involved in OT-mediated fear suppression. In vitro, exposure to blue light of channelrhodopsin-2-expressing OT axons activated a local GABAergic circuit that inhibited neurons in the output region of the CeA. Remarkably, in vivo, local blue-light-induced endogenous OT release robustly decreased freezing responses in fear-conditioned rats. Our results thus show widespread central projections of hypothalamic OT neurons and demonstrate that OT release from local axonal endings can specifically control region-associated behaviors."

Applying a next-generation sequencing assay targeting 145 cancer-relevant genes in 40 colorectal cancer and 24 non–small cell lung cancer formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens identified at least one clinically relevant genomic alteration in 59% of the samples and revealed two gene fusions, C2orf44-ALK in a colorectal cancer sample and KIF5B-RET in a lung adenocarcinoma. Further screening of 561 lung adenocarcinomas identified 11 additional tumors with KIF5B-RET gene fusions (2.0%; 95% CI 0.8–3.1%). Cells expressing oncogenic KIF5B-RET are sensitive to multi-kinase inhibitors that inhibit RET."
https://openalex.org/W1981083257,"The authors report a new type of genetic alteration in lung adenocarcinoma. Fusions of KIF5B with RET kinase are found in 1–2% of lung cancer patients, segregate from other known alterations and can potentially be targeted using RET kinase inhibitors. We identified in-frame fusion transcripts of KIF5B (the kinesin family 5B gene) and the RET oncogene, which are present in 1–2% of lung adenocarcinomas (LADCs) from people from Japan and the United States, using whole-transcriptome sequencing. The KIF5B-RET fusion leads to aberrant activation of RET kinase and is considered to be a new driver mutation of LADC because it segregates from mutations or fusions in EGFR, KRAS, HER2 and ALK, and a RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, suppresses the fusion-induced anchorage-independent growth activity of NIH3T3 cells."

Here we describe a comprehensive profile of the RNA editome of a male Han Chinese individual based on analysis of ∼767 million sequencing reads from poly(A)(+), poly(A)(-) and small RNA samples. We developed a computational pipeline that carefully controls for false positives while calling RNA editing events from genome and whole-transcriptome data of the same individual. We identified 22,688 RNA editing events in noncoding genes and introns, untranslated regions and coding sequences of protein-coding genes. Most changes (∼93%) converted A to I(G), consistent with known editing mechanisms based on adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR). We also found evidence of other types of nucleotide changes; however, these were validated at lower rates. We found 44 editing sites in microRNAs (miRNAs), suggesting a potential link between RNA editing and miRNA-mediated regulation. Our approach facilitates large-scale studies to profile and compare editomes across a wide range of samples."

https://openalex.org/W2081589050,"Spindle orientation depends on the tethering of microtubules to the cell cortex through LGN, NuMA and dynein/dynactin. Cheeseman and colleagues find that spindle-pole-associated Plk1 activity restricts polar dynein whereas chromosomal RanGTP negatively regulates LGN localization at the lateral cell cortex, thus identifying two differentially localized signals that modulate spindle positioning by acting on dynein-mediated forces. Mitotic spindle positioning by cortical pulling forces1 defines the cell division axis and location2, which is critical for proper cell division and development3. Although recent work has identified developmental and extrinsic cues that regulate spindle orientation4,5,6, the contribution of intrinsic signals to spindle positioning and orientation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that cortical force generation in human cells is controlled by distinct spindle-pole- and chromosome-derived signals that regulate cytoplasmic dynein localization. First, dynein exhibits a dynamic asymmetric cortical localization that is negatively regulated by spindle-pole proximity, resulting in spindle oscillations to centre the spindle within the cell. We find that this signal comprises the spindle-pole-localized polo-like kinase (Plk1), which regulates dynein localization by controlling the interaction between dynein–dynactin and its upstream cortical targeting factors NuMA and LGN. Second, a chromosome-derived RanGTP gradient restricts the localization of NuMA–LGN to the lateral cell cortex to define and maintain the spindle orientation axis. RanGTP acts in part through the nuclear localization sequence of NuMA to locally alter the ability of NuMA–LGN to associate with the cell cortex in the vicinity of chromosomes. We propose that these chromosome- and spindle-pole-derived gradients generate an intrinsic code to control spindle position and orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2050906087,"Febrifugine, the bioactive constituent of one of the 50 fundamental herbs of traditional Chinese medicine, has been characterized for its therapeutic activity, though its molecular target has remained unknown. Febrifugine derivatives have been used to treat malaria, cancer, fibrosis and inflammatory disease. We recently demonstrated that halofuginone (HF), a widely studied derivative of febrifugine, inhibits the development of T(H)17-driven autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis by activating the amino acid response (AAR) pathway. Here we show that HF binds glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), inhibiting prolyl-tRNA synthetase activity; this inhibition is reversed by the addition of exogenous proline or EPRS. We further show that inhibition of EPRS underlies the broad bioactivities of this family of natural product derivatives. This work both explains the molecular mechanism of a promising family of therapeutics and highlights the AAR pathway as an important drug target for promoting inflammatory resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1987753375,"X-ray crystallographic analysis of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) in complex with DNA containing 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) analogs reveals that 5caC is a preferred substrate of TDG, providing support for a 5-methylcytosine demethylation pathway involving 5-methylcytosine oxidation and removal by base-excision repair glycosylases. Human thymine DNA glycosylase (hTDG) efficiently excises 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), a key oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine in genomic DNA, in a recently discovered cytosine demethylation pathway. We present here the crystal structures of the hTDG catalytic domain in complex with duplex DNA containing either 5caC or a fluorinated analog. These structures, together with biochemical and computational analyses, reveal that 5caC is specifically recognized in the active site of hTDG, supporting the role of TDG in mammalian 5-methylcytosine demethylation."
https://openalex.org/W2042420303,"Beta oscillations in cortical-basal ganglia (BG) circuits have been implicated in normal movement suppression and motor impairment in Parkinson's disease. To dissect the functional correlates of these rhythms we compared neural activity during four distinct variants of a cued choice task in rats. Brief beta (∼20 Hz) oscillations occurred simultaneously throughout the cortical-BG network, both spontaneously and at precise moments of task performance. Beta phase was rapidly reset in response to salient cues, yet increases in beta power were not rigidly linked to cues, movements, or movement suppression. Rather, beta power was enhanced after cues were used to determine motor output. We suggest that beta oscillations reflect a postdecision stabilized state of cortical-BG networks, which normally reduces interference from alternative potential actions. The abnormally strong beta seen in Parkinson's Disease may reflect overstabilization of these networks, producing pathological persistence of the current motor state.

Conversely, artificially driving the subthalamic nucleus or motor cortex at beta frequencies slows movement (Chen et al., 2007Chen C.C. Litvak V. Gilbertson T. Kühn A. Lu C.S. Lee S.T. Tsai C.H.

From these observations it has been hypothesized that beta oscillations in cortical-BG circuits are central to the systems-level pathophysiology of PD (Hammond et al., 2007Hammond C. Bergman H.

Feingold A. Slovin H. Bergman H. Neurons in the globus pallidus do not show correlated activity in the normal monkey, but phase-locked oscillations appear in the MPTP model of parkinsonism.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 1800-1805PubMed Google Scholar). However, beta oscillations are also observed in multiple brain regions of awake, healthy subjects, including the sensorimotor neocortex of nonhuman primates (Murthy and Fetz, 1992Murthy V.N.

An SEEG case study.Exp. Brain Res. 2003; 149: 401-404PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical beta power is elevated during maintenance of a static position (Baker et al., 1997Baker S.N. Olivier E. Lemon R.N. Coherent oscillations in monkey motor cortex and hand muscle EMG show task-dependent modulation.J. Physiol. 1997; 501: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), active suppression of movement initiation (Swann et al., 2009Swann N. Tandon N. Canolty R. Ellmore T.M. McEvoy L.K. Dreyer S.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12675-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and postmovement hold periods (Pfurtscheller et al., 1996Pfurtscheller G. Stancák Jr., A. Neuper C. Post-movement beta synchronization. A correlate of an idling motor area?.Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1996; 98: 281-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Conversely, cortical beta power has been observed to decrease during movement preparation and initiation (Pfurtscheller et al., 2003Pfurtscheller G. Graimann B. Huggins J.E. Levine S.P. Schuh L.A. Spatiotemporal patterns of beta desynchronization and gamma synchronization in corticographic data during self-paced movement.Clin.

Response preparation and inhibition: the role of the cortical sensorimotor beta rhythm.Neuroscience. 2008; 156: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These results have been taken as evidence that beta oscillations reflect “maintenance of the status quo” in the motor system (Engel and Fries, 2010Engel A.K. Fries P. Beta-band oscillations—signalling the status quo?.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). This concept fits well with the proposed pathophysiological role of beta oscillations in PD, where patients have difficulty not only initiating movement, but also in stopping or switching between motor programs (Stoffers et al., 2001Stoffers D. Berendse H.W. Deijen J.B. Wolters E.C. Motor perseveration is an early sign of Parkinson's disease.Neurology. 2001; 57: 2111-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, studies of beta oscillations within BG circuits have usually involved subjects that were anesthetized, dopamine-depleted, or not engaged in specific behaviors, so the natural correlates of BG beta oscillations are not well defined. Here we investigate the functional correlates of BG beta oscillations in intact, unrestrained rats. We recorded simultaneously from multiple structures to assess whether beta rhythms coordinate activity throughout the BG network. The rats performed four task variants that make different demands for behavioral control: subjects were instructed to promptly make specific movements (“Immediate-GO”), program movements but delay their execution (“Deferred-GO”), inhibit movements (“NOGO”), or cancel movements-in-preparation (“STOP”). By comparing beta power time courses under each condition, we examined how dynamic states of cortical-BG circuits relate to distinct sensorimotor subprocesses. We first examined LFPs recorded from the striatum (STR), globus pallidus (GP), and primary motor cortex (M1) during a choice reaction time task. Rats initiated trials by poking and holding their position within an illuminated nose-port (Figures 1A and 1B ). After a variable interval, one of two instruction cues (1 kHz, 4 kHz tones) directed the rat to quickly move his nose one port to the left or right, respectively. We have previously shown that contralateral performance in this “Immediate-GO” task is dependent on intact function of sensorimotor striatum (Gage et al., 2010Gage G.J. Stoetzner C.R. Wiltschko A.B. Berke J.D. Selective activation of striatal fast-spiking interneurons during choice execution.Neuron. 2010; 67: 466-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Beta oscillations (15–25 Hz) were consistently more pronounced in STR and GP compared to M1, yet in each structure beta power was similarly modulated by task events (Figure 1C). Beta power initially dipped as rats entered the first port and stayed there (Nose In). This was followed by a sharp beta increase (“event-related synchronization,” ERS) after the instruction tone (Cue/Go), which peaked just after they initiated their chosen movement (Nose Out). There was a further abrupt decrease in beta power (an “event-related desynchronization,” ERD) as rats completed this movement (Side In), which triggered an audible food pellet delivery click on correct trials. Movement initiation is typically associated with beta ERDs, in contrast to the ERS that we observed. However, most prior studies have either used self-paced movements (Pfurtscheller et al., 2003Pfurtscheller G. Graimann B. Huggins J.E. Levine S.P. Schuh L.A.

We therefore examined beta power during a second task version (“Deferred-GO,” Figure 1B). In this task, subjects can use the instruction cue to prepare a movement, but to obtain reward they must delay execution until presentation of a separate “Go” signal. Information about the behavior of each rat in each task is given in Table S1 (available online). Rats trained in the Immediate-GO and Deferred-GO tasks attempted similar numbers of trials per session (averaging 173 and 160, respectively), consistent with similar levels of motivation. In the Deferred-GO task the patterns of beta power (Figure 1D) more closely matched prior studies of nonhuman primate sensorimotor cortex (Sanes and Donoghue, 1993Sanes J.N. Donoghue J.P.

Hotton G. Yarrow K. Brown P. Behavioural cues are associated with modulations of synchronous oscillations in the human subthalamic nucleus.Brain. 2003; 126: 1975-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For both tasks we observed a beta ERS several hundred milliseconds after instruction cue onset, even though the behaviors occurring at this time were very different (moving for Immediate-GO, holding for Deferred-GO). Conversely, some key epochs with similar overt behavior between tasks were associated with very different levels of beta power. This is most obvious around the time of Go cues (third panel of Figure 1D), for which rats in both tasks were maintaining a hold in the initial nose-port during epoch “1,” and initiating movement during epoch “2.” Providing advance information about movement direction affects reaction times (RTs) (Luce, 1986Luce R.D. Response Times: Their Role in Inferring Elementary Mental Organization. Oxford University Press, New York, NY1986Google Scholar). We examined individual RT distributions (Figures S1C and S1D) to assess their contribution to beta power differences between tasks. Rats performing the Deferred-GO task had bimodal RT distributions consistent with their sometimes reacting to the Go cue, but sometimes anticipating it (Gage et al., 2010Gage G.J. Stoetzner C.R. Wiltschko A.B. Berke J.D. Selective activation of striatal fast-spiking interneurons during choice execution.Neuron. 2010; 67: 466-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Strikingly, there was a beta ERS after the Go cue only for long-RT (>300 ms; presumed reactive) trials. On short-RT (<300 ms; presumed anticipatory) trials we found a beta ERD instead. During the Immediate-GO task, for which the rats do not know which way to go until the Cue/Go event, the beta ERS was observed for both long- and short-RT trials. From the Immediate- and Deferred-GO tasks, we draw several interim conclusions. First, beta power increases are not simply associated with holding position during delay periods, since in neither task did we see increased beta as subjects waited for the instruction cue. Second, beta power increases are not simply associated with movement, since the instruction cue produced a very similar beta ERS regardless of whether the instructed movement was performed immediately or was deferred. Third, presentation of a salient, task-relevant cue is not sufficient, since the beta ERS only followed the Go cue when the rats reacted to this cue, rather than having already anticipated it. Also inconsistent with a purely sensory response is the tighter locking of the beta ERS to movement onset than to the cue on Immediate-GO trials (Figure 1D). To further investigate the functional correlates of BG beta oscillations, another group of rats was tested during two additional task variants (“Go/NoGo,” “Stop-Signal”). These closely resembled the Immediate-Go task but incorporated cued movement suppression on some trials. To assess the organization of beta oscillations within the BG, implants targeted STR, GP, subthalamic nucleus (STN), and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr; Figures 2A and Figures S3A), together with a frontal electrocorticogram (ECoG). We found that beta oscillations occur simultaneously throughout the BG network (Figure 2B), in ∼100–200 ms epochs (Figure S2A) that involve the cortical site as well. In plots of power spectral density (Figure 2C), each rat had peak BG beta frequency slightly below 20 Hz (range: 17.9–19.5 Hz) with cortical frequency consistently a touch higher (18.4 Hz to 20.4 Hz). If beta oscillations represent a distinct, network-wide coordinated BG state, this should be apparent in analyses of phase and power relationships between structures. Coherence between all BG structures consistently showed a peak at ∼20 Hz for all rats (Figures 2D and Figures S3B). By contrast, we have previously shown that coherence between striatum and dorsal hippocampus in behaving rats is close to zero at 20 Hz (Berke et al., 2004Berke J.D. Okatan M. Skurski J.

We next constructed comodulograms, which illustrate the extent to which moment-to-moment oscillatory power covaries between structures (Buzsáki et al., 2003Buzsáki G. Buhl D.L. Harris K.D.

Coordinated power changes within the BG network were observed especially at ∼20 Hz (Figures 2D and Figures S3B). Modulation of beta power relative to behavioral events was essentially identical throughout the BG, and similar between BG and ECoG (Figure S2B). There was no consistent difference in the modulation of beta power for ipsilateral versus contralateral movements (Figure S4). We have previously reported that striatal LFPs show mutually exclusive dynamic states, characterized by combinations of either ∼20 Hz beta and ∼50 Hz low-gamma rhythms, or ∼8 Hz theta and ∼80 Hz high-gamma rhythms, respectively (Berke, 2009Berke J.D. Fast oscillations in cortical-striatal networks switch frequency following rewarding events and stimulant drugs.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2009; 30: 848-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar; see also Dejean et al., 2011Dejean C. Arbuthnott G. Wickens J.R. Le Moine C. Boraud T. Hyland B.I.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 6098-6107Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These distinct states were visible in our current comodulograms: in STR, GP, and STN ∼50 Hz power was positively correlated with beta power and negatively correlated with ∼80 Hz activity. These relationships were absent or diminished for SNr. BG beta rhythms were tightly coordinated between structures, but not identical in all respects. We consistently observed a significant difference in beta phase between simultaneously recorded subregions (28 pairwise comparisons, p < 0.05 in every case; see Experimental Procedures). Although the specific set of recording regions varied between subjects, for all four rats we were able to compare beta phases between frontal ECoG, STR, and GP (Figure 2E). STR beta was always phase-advanced relative to the ECoG, (by an average of 97°), and GP was always slightly phase-advanced relative to the striatum (by an average of 4.8°). These results rule out some nonphysiological explanations for coordinated beta rhythms throughout the BG—for example, if the beta oscillations were on the common reference electrode, they would show no phase shift across regions. However, phase differences do not necessarily indicate where an ERS/ERD occurs first, especially as beta has a different phase at the cortical surface compared to deep layers (Murthy and Fetz, 1992Murthy V.N. Fetz E.E. Coherent 25- to 35-Hz oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex of awake behaving monkeys.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 5670-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). We therefore also examined the slopes of the phase spectra between the ECoG, STR, and GP at beta frequencies (Figure S3C), which provides a measure of signal delay (Brown et al., 1998Brown P. Salenius S. Rothwell J.C. Hari R. Cortical correlate of the Piper rhythm in humans.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 2911-2917PubMed Google Scholar). The consistently very shallow slopes indicate that beta oscillations emerge with only small time delays throughout the cortical-BG network. Overall, our results are consistent with ∼20 Hz beta having a selective, distinct role in coordinating information processing within the BG of normal behaving animals. To explore beta timing in more detail, we examined trial-by-trial LFP traces during GO trials (Figure 3A ). Epochs of high beta power appeared to occur stochastically, with some task events either increasing (Cue) or diminishing (Side In) the probability of entering this beta state. Around detected movement onset (Nose Out) the pattern of beta power change was unexpectedly complex, showing a marked dependence on reaction time. For the most rapid responses, the beta ERS began around the time of movement onset and peaked shortly afterwards (Figures 3A and 3B). On trials with slower responses, the beta ERS began well before movements and was mostly completed by movement onset. To quantify this phenomenon we compared beta power for fast- versus slow-RT trials during the 300 ms epochs immediately preceding and following movement onset (Figure 3B, top). In both epochs all subjects had a significant difference in beta power (paired t tests before Nose out: for 3 rats p < 10−4, for the other p = 0.024; after Nose out: p < 10−3 for all rats). In addition, we calculated correlation coefficients between beta power and reaction time at each moment during task performance (Figure 3B, bottom). A strong positive correlation was found about 750 ms after the Cue event, driven by the ERD that is maximal around movement completion (see Kühn et al., 2004Kühn A.A. Williams D. Kupsch A. Limousin P. Hariz M. Schneider G.H. Yarrow K. Brown P.

J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar for related observations in humans). In addition, a smaller but reliable correlation occurred ∼30–100 ms before movement initiation. This suggests that the presence of the high-beta state during a critical period delays movement onset, consistent with evidence in humans associating increased beta power with slower movements (Levy et al., 2002Levy R. Ashby P. Hutchison W.D. Lang A.E. Lozano A.M. Dostrovsky J.O.

The Go/NoGo task variant (Figure 3C) is similar to the Immediate-Go task, except that there are three possible instruction cues: Go left, Go right, or hold in place (NoGo). As before, simply holding before the instruction cue was not associated with elevated beta. However, both Go and NoGo cues were similarly followed after several hundred milliseconds by a beta ERS (Figures 3D and 3E). This observation suggests that planning not to move is also associated with enhanced beta and confirms that the main beta ERS that we analyze here is not rigidly linked to either movement initiation or suppression. At the same time, we observed two interesting differences between GO and NOGO trials. First, the beta ERS to the NoGo cue was not followed by the marked ERD seen on GO trials, consistent with a more direct relationship between beta ERD and movement. Second, we noticed that the NoGo cue provoked an additional beta ERS with very low latency, and this was of consistently higher power in the frontal ECoG compared to BG sites (Figure S2C).

https://openalex.org/W2025570007,"Crystal structures of menin in its free form and in complexes with MLL1 or with JUND, or with an MLL1–LEDGF heterodimer, show that menin contains a deep pocket that binds short peptides of MLL1 or JUND in the same manner, but produces opposite effects on transcription. The nuclear protein menin can both promote tumorigenesis — for instance, it is an oncogenic cofactor in leukaemias induced by MLL translocations — and act as a tumour suppressor, depending on the cell lineage. It interacts with several transcriptional regulators, including the transcription factor JUND and the histone methyltransferase MLL1. Here, the crystal structures of menin in its free form and in complexes with JUND or MLL1 are determined. The structures help to explain menin's opposing effects on transcription. It can block JNK-mediated phosphorylation of JUND and therefore suppress JUND-induced transcription, but it acts as a scaffold to promote formation of a transcriptional complex containing MLL1. Menin is a tumour suppressor protein whose loss or inactivation causes multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1), a hereditary autosomal dominant tumour syndrome that is characterized by tumorigenesis in multiple endocrine organs1. Menin interacts with many proteins and is involved in a variety of cellular processes2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Menin binds the JUN family transcription factor JUND and inhibits its transcriptional activity2,9. Several MEN1 missense mutations disrupt the menin–JUND interaction, suggesting a correlation between the tumour-suppressor function of menin and its suppression of JUND-activated transcription2,10. Menin also interacts with mixed lineage leukaemia protein 1 (MLL1), a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, and functions as an oncogenic cofactor to upregulate gene transcription and promote MLL1-fusion-protein-induced leukaemogenesis5,7,11,12. A recent report on the tethering of MLL1 to chromatin binding factor lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) by menin indicates that menin is a molecular adaptor coordinating the functions of multiple proteins13. Despite its importance, how menin interacts with many distinct partners and regulates their functions remains poorly understood. Here we present the crystal structures of human menin in its free form and in complexes with MLL1 or with JUND, or with an MLL1–LEDGF heterodimer. These structures show that menin contains a deep pocket that binds short peptides of MLL1 or JUND in the same manner, but that it can have opposite effects on transcription. The menin–JUND interaction blocks JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated JUND phosphorylation and suppresses JUND-induced transcription. In contrast, menin promotes gene transcription by binding the transcription activator MLL1 through the peptide pocket while still interacting with the chromatin-anchoring protein LEDGF at a distinct surface formed by both menin and MLL1."

Neisseria require iron for survival and can extract it directly from human transferrin for transport across the outer membrane. The transport system consists of TbpA, an integral outer membrane protein, and TbpB, a co-receptor attached to the cell surface; both proteins are potentially important vaccine and therapeutic targets. Two key questions driving Neisseria research are how human transferrin is specifically targeted, and how the bacteria liberate iron from transferrin at neutral pH. To address these questions, we solved crystal structures of the TbpA-transferrin complex and of the corresponding co-receptor TbpB. We characterized the TbpB-transferrin complex by small-angle X-ray scattering and the TbpA-TbpB-transferrin complex by electron microscopy. Our studies provide a rational basis for the specificity of TbpA for human transferrin, show how TbpA promotes iron release from transferrin, and elucidate how TbpB facilitates this process."

Recent evidence suggests that individuals may strategically explore as a function of the relative uncertainty about the expected value of options. However, the neural mechanisms supporting uncertainty-driven exploration remain underspecified. The present fMRI study scanned a reinforcement learning task in which participants stop a rotating clock hand in order to win points. Reward schedules were such that expected value could increase, decrease, or remain constant with respect to time. We fit several mathematical models to subject behavior to generate trial-by-trial estimates of exploration as a function of relative uncertainty. These estimates were used to analyze our fMRI data. Results indicate that rostrolateral prefrontal cortex tracks trial-by-trial changes in relative uncertainty, and this pattern distinguished individuals who rely on relative uncertainty for their exploratory decisions versus those who do not.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwMWE4NGNkZTI4OTAyNDM1YTIxMTVlN2EzNzgxMjcwZSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MjcwMTYxfQ.KZ2sb2ZJNz66YXbXj0LF22jEAnOBqtBWgR-X5afefYoZvtmmLSD8RZP8C1x4SkypcFpqVskU9FzOuFvHbLKePV0l_t130EweF7LZpuVJUluaTb50viPTK_-9j_AxmuuA5RXGAPMt2KiOLK31QxzqJkCrzAB4vY3Sh0FXnp0xhXSYonsj5GNuDT5Ays9jBwzr6nGQLZhOZDKYU8I9N3yTy-ZSOkjLqI5jVRltfAR-Q_4nIfa_drY8uHtulYQEide0iTn6LXmTxHaZWWmbPOIJCwkWTrP1QxHKoUKimHEgNkA525wWcQL27vaYrQeUrqrbtg1BJh8kTTJsBt_FEAGzRw(mp4, (17.46 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2076262535,"AgRP neuron activity drives feeding and weight gain whereas that of nearby POMC neurons does the opposite. However, the role of excitatory glutamatergic input in controlling these neurons is unknown. To address this question, we generated mice lacking NMDA receptors (NMDARs) on either AgRP or POMC neurons. Deletion of NMDARs from AgRP neurons markedly reduced weight, body fat and food intake whereas deletion from POMC neurons had no effect. Activation of AgRP neurons by fasting, as assessed by c-Fos, Agrp and Npy mRNA expression, AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs, depolarization and firing rates, required NMDARs. Furthermore, AgRP but not POMC neurons have dendritic spines and increased glutamatergic input onto AgRP neurons caused by fasting was paralleled by an increase in spines, suggesting fasting induced synaptogenesis and spinogenesis. Thus glutamatergic synaptic transmission and its modulation by NMDARs play key roles in controlling AgRP neurons and determining the cellular and behavioral response to fasting."

https://openalex.org/W2153977542,"Shifts of gaze and shifts of attention are closely linked and it is debated whether they result from the same neural mechanisms. Both processes involve the frontal eye fields (FEF), an area which is also a source of top-down feedback to area V4 during covert attention. To test the relative contributions of oculomotor and attention-related FEF signals to such feedback, we recorded simultaneously from both areas in a covert attention task and in a saccade task. In the attention task, only visual and visuomovement FEF neurons showed enhanced responses, whereas movement cells were unchanged. Importantly, visual, but not movement or visuomovement cells, showed enhanced gamma frequency synchronization with activity in V4 during attention. Within FEF, beta synchronization was increased for movement cells during attention but was suppressed in the saccade task. These findings support the idea that the attentional modulation of visual processing is not mediated by movement neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2038909771,"Background The EQ-5D is a preference based instrument which provides a description of a respondent's health status, and an empirically derived value for that health state often from a representative sample of the general population. It is commonly used to derive Quality Adjusted Life Year calculations (QALY) in economic evaluations. However, values for health states have been found to differ between countries. The objective of this study was to develop a set of values for the EQ-5D health states for use in Canada. Methods Values for 48 different EQ-5D health states were elicited using the Time Trade Off (TTO) via a web survey in English. A random effect model was fitted to the data to estimate values for all 243 health states of the EQ-5D. Various model specifications were explored. Comparisons with EQ-5D values from the UK and US were made. Sensitivity analysis explored different transformations of values worse than dead, and exclusion criteria of subjects. Results The final model was estimated from the values of 1145 subjects with socio-demographics broadly representative of Canadian general population with the exception of Quebec. This yielded a good fit with observed TTO values, with an overall R2 of 0.403 and a mean absolute error of 0.044. Conclusion A preference-weight algorithm for Canadian studies that include the EQ-5D is developed. The primary limitations regarded the representativeness of the final sample, given the language used (English only), the method of recruitment, and the difficulty in the task. Insights into potential issues for conducting valuation studies in countries as large and diverse as Canada are gained."

https://openalex.org/W1980458440,"The parasite Plasmodium vivax is the most frequent cause of malaria outside of sub-Saharan Africa, but efforts to develop viable vaccines against P. vivax so far have been inadequate. We recently developed pathogen-mimicking polymeric vaccine nanoparticles composed of the FDA-approved biodegradable polymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) “enveloped” by a lipid membrane. In this study, we sought to determine whether this vaccine delivery platform could be applied to enhance the immune response against P. vivax sporozoites. A candidate malaria antigen, VMP001, was conjugated to the lipid membrane of the particles, and an immunostimulatory molecule, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), was incorporated into the lipid membranes, creating pathogen-mimicking nanoparticle vaccines (VMP001-NPs). Vaccination with VMP001-NPs promoted germinal center formation and elicited durable antigen-specific antibodies with significantly higher titers and more balanced Th1/Th2 responses in vivo, compared with vaccines composed of soluble protein mixed with MPLA. Antibodies raised by NP vaccinations also exhibited enhanced avidity and affinity toward the domains within the circumsporozoite protein implicated in protection and were able to agglutinate live P. vivax sporozoites. These results demonstrate that these VMP001-NPs are promising vaccines candidates that may elicit protective immunity against P. vivax sporozoites."
https://openalex.org/W2158210991,"Ocean acidification has the potential to cause dramatic changes in marine ecosystems. Larval damselfish exposed to concentrations of CO2 predicted to occur in the mid- to late-century show maladaptive responses to predator cues. However, there is considerable variation both within and between species in CO2 effects, whereby some individuals are unaffected at particular CO2 concentrations while others show maladaptive responses to predator odour. Our goal was to test whether learning via chemical or visual information would be impaired by ocean acidification and ultimately, whether learning can mitigate the effects of ocean acidification by restoring the appropriate responses of prey to predators. Using two highly efficient and widespread mechanisms for predator learning, we compared the behaviour of pre-settlement damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis that were exposed to 440 µatm CO2 (current day levels) or 850 µatm CO2, a concentration predicted to occur in the ocean before the end of this century. We found that, regardless of the method of learning, damselfish exposed to elevated CO2 failed to learn to respond appropriately to a common predator, the dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus. To determine whether the lack of response was due to a failure in learning or rather a short-term shift in trade-offs preventing the fish from displaying overt antipredator responses, we conditioned 440 or 700 µatm-CO2 fish to learn to recognize a dottyback as a predator using injured conspecific cues, as in Experiment 1. When tested one day post-conditioning, CO2 exposed fish failed to respond to predator odour. When tested 5 days post-conditioning, CO2 exposed fish still failed to show an antipredator response to the dottyback odour, despite the fact that both control and CO2-treated fish responded to a general risk cue (injured conspecific cues). These results indicate that exposure to CO2 may alter the cognitive ability of juvenile fish and render learning ineffective."
https://openalex.org/W2010308368,"Acetylation is mediated by acetyltransferases and deacetylases, and occurs not only on histones but also on diverse proteins. Although histone acetylation in chromatin structure and transcription has been well studied, the biological roles of non-histone acetylation remain elusive. Histone deacetylase 6 (Hdac6), a member of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family, is a unique deacetylase that localizes to cytoplasm and functions in many cellular events by deacetylating non-histone proteins including α-tubulin, Hsp90, and cortactin. Since robust expression of Hdac6 is observed in brain, it would be expected that Hdac6-mediated reversible acetylation plays essential roles in CNS. Here we demonstrate the crucial roles of Hdac6 deacetylase activity in the expression of emotional behavior in mice. We found that Hdac6-deficient mice exhibit hyperactivity, less anxiety, and antidepressant-like behavior in behavioral tests. Moreover, administration of Hdac6-specific inhibitor replicated antidepressant-like behavior in mice. In good agreement with behavioral phenotypes of Hdac6-deficient mice, Hdac6 dominantly localizes to the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, which are involved in emotional behaviors. These findings suggest that HDAC6-mediated reversible acetylation might contribute to maintain proper neuronal activity in serotonergic neurons, and also provide a new therapeutic target for depression."

The mechanisms are incompletely understood, although dysfunction of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis might be involved. We examined the association between cortisol responses to laboratory-induced mental stress and the progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC). Methods and Results Participants were 466 healthy men and women (mean age = 62.7±5.6 yrs), without history or objective signs of CHD, drawn from the Whitehall II epidemiological cohort. At the baseline assessment salivary cortisol was measured in response to mental stressors, consisting of a 5-min Stroop task and a 5-min mirror tracing task. CAC was measured at baseline and at 3 years follow up using electron beam computed tomography. CAC progression was defined as an increase >10 Agatston units between baseline and follow up. 38.2% of the sample demonstrated CAC progression over the 3 years follow up. There was considerable variation in the cortisol stress response, with approximately 40% of the sample responding to the stress tasks with an increase in cortisol of at least 1 mmol/l. There was an association between cortisol stress reactivity (per SD) and CAC progression (odds ratio = 1.27, 95% CI, 1.02–1.60) after adjustments for age, sex, pre-stress cortisol, employment grade, smoking, resting systolic BP, fibrinogen, body mass index, and use of statins. There was no association between systolic blood pressure reactivity and CAC progression (odds ratio per SD increase = 1.03, 95% CI, 0.85–1.24). Other independent predictors of CAC progression included age, male sex, smoking, resting systolic blood pressure, and fibrinogen. Conclusion Results demonstrate an association between heightened cortisol reactivity to stress and CAC progression. These data support the notion that cortisol reactivity, an index of HPA function, is one of the possible mechanisms through which psychosocial stress may influence the risk of CHD."

We performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis on microarray data from singing zebra finches to discover gene ensembles regulated during vocal behavior. We found ∼2,000 singing-regulated genes comprising three coexpression groups unique to area X, the basal ganglia subregion dedicated to learned vocalizations. These contained known targets of human FOXP2 and potential avian targets. We validated biological pathways not previously implicated in vocalization. Higher-order gene coexpression patterns, rather than expression levels, molecularly distinguish area X from the ventral striato-pallidum during singing. The previously unknown structure of singing-driven networks enables prioritization of molecular interactors that probably bear on human motor disorders, especially those affecting speech."
https://openalex.org/W2013985429,"This study used fMRI to find that the dorsal visual area (V3B/KO) combines information about binocular disparity and relative motion cues to work out depth information. Humans exploit a range of visual depth cues to estimate three-dimensional structure. For example, the slant of a nearby tabletop can be judged by combining information from binocular disparity, texture and perspective. Behavioral tests show humans combine cues near-optimally, a feat that could depend on discriminating the outputs from cue-specific mechanisms or on fusing signals into a common representation. Although fusion is computationally attractive, it poses a substantial challenge, requiring the integration of quantitatively different signals. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to provide evidence that dorsal visual area V3B/KO meets this challenge. Specifically, we found that fMRI responses are more discriminable when two cues (binocular disparity and relative motion) concurrently signal depth, and that information provided by one cue is diagnostic of depth indicated by the other. This suggests a cortical node important when perceiving depth, and highlights computations based on fusion in the dorsal stream."
https://openalex.org/W2138931746,"Neuromodulatory input, acting on G protein-coupled receptors, is essential for the induction of experience-dependent cortical plasticity. Here we report that G-coupled receptors in layer II/III of visual cortex control the polarity of synaptic plasticity through a pull-push regulation of LTP and LTD. In slices, receptors coupled to Gs promote LTP while suppressing LTD; conversely, receptors coupled to Gq11 promote LTD and suppress LTP. In vivo, the selective stimulation of Gs- or Gq11-coupled receptors brings the cortex into LTP-only or LTD-only states, which allows the potentiation or depression of targeted synapses with visual stimulation. The pull-push regulation of LTP/LTD occurs via direct control of the synaptic plasticity machinery and it is independent of changes in NMDAR activation or neuronal excitability. We propose these simple rules governing the pull-push control of LTP/LTD form a general metaplasticity mechanism that may contribute to neuromodulation of plasticity in other cortical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2076910258,"Chinese wheat mini core collection (262 accessions) was genotyped at 531 microsatellite loci representing a mean marker density of 5.1 cM. One-thousand-kernel weights (TKW) of lines were measured in five trials (three environments in four growing seasons). Structure analysis based on 42 unlinked SSR loci indicated that the materials formed two sub-populations, viz., landraces and modern varieties. A large difference in TKW (7.08 g, P<0.001) was found between the two sub-groups. Therefore, TKW is a major yield component that was improved in the past 6 decades; it increased from a mean 31.5 g in the 1940s to 44.64 g in the 2000s, representing a 2.19 g increase in each decade. Analyses based on a mixed linear model (MLM), population structure (Q) and relative kinship (K) revealed 22 SSR loci that were significantly associated with mean TKW (MTKW) of the five trials estimated by the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) method. They were mainly distributed on chromosomes of homoeologous groups 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7. Six loci, cfa2234-3A, gwm156-3B, barc56-5A, gwm234-5B, wmc17-7A and cfa2257-7A individually explained more than 11.84% of the total phenotypic variation. Favored alleles for breeding at the 22 loci were inferred according to their estimated effects on MTKW based on mean difference of varieties grouped by genotypes. Statistical simulation showed that these favored alleles have additive genetic effects. Frequency changes of alleles at loci associated with TKW are much more dramatic than those at neutral loci between the sub-groups. The numbers of favored alleles in modern varieties indicate there is still considerable genetic potential for their use as markers for genome selection of TKW in wheat breeding. Alleles that can be used globally to increase TKW were inferred according to their distribution by latitude and frequency of changes between landraces and the modern varieties."

Here, we explore the relationship between age of learning, learning ability, and specialized brain structures. Specifically, we ask whether the existence of reproducible cortical domains necessarily means that certain abilities are innate, or innately easily learned, or whether reproducible domains can be formed, or refined, by interactions between genetic programs and common early experience. Functional MRI showed that intensive early, but not late, experience caused the formation of category-selective regions in macaque temporal lobe for stimuli never naturally encountered by monkeys. And behaviorally, early training produced more fluent processing of these stimuli than the same training in adults. One explanation for these results is that in higher cortical areas, as in early sensory areas, experience drives functional clustering and functional clustering determines how that information is processed."
https://openalex.org/W2119202517,"Background Nocturia has been independently associated with cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality, but such studies did not adjust for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which may have mediated such a relationship. Our aims were to determine whether an association between nocturia and cardiovascular morbidity exists that is independent of SDB. We also determined whether nocturia is independently associated with SDB. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to accomplish these aims we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Sleep Heart Health Study that contained information regarding SDB, nocturia, and cardiovascular morbidity in a middle-age to elderly community-based population. In 6342 participants (age 63±11 [SD] years, 53% women), after adjusting for known confounders such as age, body mass index, diuretic use, diabetes mellitus, alpha-blocker use, nocturia was independently associated with SDB (measured as Apnea Hypopnea index >15 per hour; OR 1.3; 95%CI, 1.2–1.5). After adjusting for SDB and other known confounders, nocturia was independently associated with prevalent hypertension (OR 1.23; 95%CI 1.08–1.40; P = 0.002), cardiovascular disease (OR 1.26; 95%CI 1.05–1.52; P = 0.02) and stroke (OR 1.62; 95%CI 1.14–2.30; P = 0.007). Moreover, nocturia was also associated with adverse objective alterations of sleep as measured by polysomnography and self-reported excessive daytime sleepiness (P<0.05). Conclusions/Significance Nocturia is independently associated with sleep-disordered breathing. After adjusting for SDB, there remained an association between nocturia and cardiovascular morbidity. Such results support screening for SDB in patients with nocturia, but the mechanisms underlying the relationship between nocturia and cardiovascular morbidity requires further study. MeSH terms: Nocturia, sleep-disordered breathing, obstructive sleep apnea, sleep apnea, polysomnography, hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2002013105,"BACE1 is a key enzyme for amyloid-β (Aβ) production, and an attractive therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report that BACE1 inhibitors have distinct effects on neuronal Aβ metabolism, inducing a unique pattern of secreted Aβ peptides, analyzed in cell media from amyloid precursor protein (APP) transfected cells and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from dogs by immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, using several different BACE1 inhibitors. Besides the expected reductions in Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42, treatment also changed the relative levels of several other Aβ isoforms. In particular Aβ1-34 decreased, while Aβ5-40 increased, and these changes were more sensitive to BACE1 inhibition than the changes in Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42. The effects on Aβ5-40 indicate the presence of a BACE1 independent pathway of APP degradation. The described CSF Aβ pattern may be used as a pharmacodynamic fingerprint to detect biochemical effects of BACE1-therapies in clinical trials, which might accelerate development of novel therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1967904001,"Late blight, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, is the most important disease of potato (Solanum tuberosum). Understanding the molecular basis of resistance and susceptibility to late blight is therefore highly relevant for developing resistant cultivars, either by marker-assissted selection or by transgenic approaches. Specific P. infestans races having the Avr1 effector gene trigger a hypersensitive resistance response in potato plants carrying the R1 resistance gene (incompatible interaction) and cause disease in plants lacking R1 (compatible interaction). The transcriptomes of the compatible and incompatible interaction were captured by DeepSAGE analysis of 44 biological samples comprising five genotypes, differing only by the presence or absence of the R1 transgene, three infection time points and three biological replicates. 30.859 unique 21 base pair sequence tags were obtained, one third of which did not match any known potato transcript sequence. Two third of the tags were expressed at low frequency (<10 tag counts/million). 20.470 unitags matched to approximately twelve thousand potato transcribed genes. Tag frequencies were compared between compatible and incompatible interactions over the infection time course and between compatible and incompatible genotypes. Transcriptional changes were more numerous in compatible than in incompatible interactions. In contrast to incompatible interactions, transcriptional changes in the compatible interaction were observed predominantly for multigene families encoding defense response genes and genes functional in photosynthesis and CO2 fixation. Numerous transcriptional differences were also observed between near isogenic genotypes prior to infection with P. infestans. Our DeepSAGE transcriptome analysis uncovered novel candidate genes for plant host pathogen interactions, examples of which are discussed with respect to possible function."
https://openalex.org/W1989759690,"Intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins are well established as conserved mediators of flagellum/cilium assembly and disassembly. However, data has begun to accumulate in support of IFT protein involvement in other processes elsewhere in the cell. Here, we used synchronous cultures of Chlamydomonas to investigate the temporal patterns of accumulation and localization of IFT proteins during the cell cycle. Their mRNAs showed periodic expression that peaked during S and M phase (S/M). Unlike most proteins that are synthesized continuously during G1 phase, IFT27 and IFT46 levels were found to increase only during S/M phase. During cell division, IFT27, IFT46, IFT72, and IFT139 re-localized from the flagella and basal bodies to the cleavage furrow. IFT27 was further shown to be associated with membrane vesicles in this region. This localization pattern suggests a role for IFT in cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2123578618,"Gamma-band (25–140 Hz) oscillations are a hallmark of sensory processing in the forebrain. The optic tectum (OT), a midbrain structure implicated in sensorimotor processing and attention, also exhibits gamma oscillations. However, the origin and mechanisms of these oscillations remain unknown. We discovered that in acute slices of the avian OT, persistent (>100 ms) epochs of large amplitude gamma oscillations can be evoked that closely resemble those recorded in vivo. We found that cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic mechanisms differentially regulate the structure of the oscillations at various timescales. These persistent oscillations originate in the multisensory layers of the OT and are broadcast to visual layers via the cholinergic nucleus Ipc, providing a potential mechanism for enhancing the processing of visual information within the OT. The finding that the midbrain contains an intrinsic gamma-generating circuit suggests that the OT could use its own oscillatory code to route signals to forebrain networks."
https://openalex.org/W1993712988,"The mechanism of atherosclerotic plaque progression leading to instability, rupture, and ischemic manifestation involves oxidative stress and apoptosis. Humanin (HN) is a newly emerging endogenously expressed cytoprotective peptide. Our goal was to determine the presence and localization of HN in carotid atherosclerotic plaques.Plaque specimens from 34 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were classified according to symptomatic history. Immunostaining combined with digital microscopy revealed greater expression of HN in the unstable plaques of symptomatic compared to asymptomatic patients (29.42±2.05 vs. 14.14±2.13% of plaque area, p<0.0001). These data were further confirmed by immunoblot (density of HN/β-actin standard symptomatic vs. asymptomatic 1.32±0.14 vs. 0.79±0.11, p<0.01). TUNEL staining revealed a higher proportion of apoptotic nuclei in the plaques of symptomatic patients compared to asymptomatic (68.25±3.61 vs. 33.46±4.46% of nuclei, p<0.01). Double immunofluorescence labeling revealed co-localization of HN with macrophages (both M1 and M2 polarization), smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and dendritic cells as well as with inflammatory markers MMP2 and MMP9.The study demonstrates a higher expression of HN in unstable carotid plaques that is localized to multiple cell types within the plaque. These data support the involvement of HN in atherosclerosis, possibly as an endogenous response to the inflammatory and apoptotic processes within the atheromatous plaque."
https://openalex.org/W2024786055,"Previous works have documented the contribution of different IL28B-associated SNPs to spontaneous HCV clearance. This study investigated the effect of different interleukin (IL) 28B genetic variants on interferon (IFN)-based therapy response. We genotyped eight IL28B single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a cohort of 197 hepatitis C virus (HCV)/human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coinfected patients from our clinic unit who received combined pegylated (peg)-IFN-α and ribavirin (RBV) therapy. This analysis included the two strongest tag predictors for HCV clearance, rs8099917 and rs12979860, and four causal variants (rs4803219, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217) located in the IL28B promoter, coding, and 3'-untranslated regions. Haplotypes carrying the major alleles at IL28B SNPs were highly associated with sustained virological responses (SVRs) after treatment with peg-IFN-α and RBV [odds ratio (OR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6-4.0, 4.0×10(-5)]. Three causal SNP genotypes (rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217) displayed the highest association with SVRs (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 2.0-6.7, p = 1.3×10(-5)). All four causal variants were in high linkage disequilibrium, both among themselves (r(2)≥0.94) and with the rs12979860 variant (r(2)≥0.92). In contrast, rs8099917 was in low linkage disequilibrium with the four causal variants (r(2)≤0.45) and with the rs12979860 variant (r(2) = 0.45). These results demonstrate that rs12979860, compared to rs8099917, may be a better predictor of response to the peg-IFN/RBV treatment among HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients. Moreover, causal IL28B variants are strongly associated with treatment SVRs."
https://openalex.org/W2124352372,"Although wild waterfowl are the main reservoir for low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIv), the environment plays a critical role for the circulation and persistence of AIv. LPAIv may persist for extended periods in cold environments, suggesting that waterfowl breeding areas in the northern hemisphere may be an important reservoir for AIv in contrast to the warmer southern wintering areas. We evaluated whether southern wetlands, with relatively small populations (thousands) of resident waterfowl, maintain AIv in the summer, prior to the arrival of millions of migratory birds. We collected water and fecal samples at ten wetlands in two regions (Yolo Bypass and Sacramento Valley) of the California Central Valley during three bi-weekly intervals beginning in late July, 2010. We detected AIv in 29/367 fecal samples (7.9%) and 12/597 water samples (2.0%) by matrix real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR). We isolated two H3N8, two H2N3, and one H4N8 among rRT-PCR positive fecal samples but no live virus from water samples. Detection of AIv RNA in fecal samples was higher from wetlands in the Sacramento Valley (11.9%) than in the Yolo Bypass (0.0%), but no difference was found for water samples (2.7 vs. 1.7%, respectively). Our study showed that low densities of hosts and unfavorable environmental conditions did not prevent LPAIv circulation during summer in California wetlands. Our findings justify further investigations to understand AIv dynamics in resident waterfowl populations, compare AIv subtypes between migratory and resident waterfowl, and assess the importance of local AIv as a source of infection for migratory birds."
https://openalex.org/W1988983395,"The 2009 influenza pandemic provided an opportunity to observe dynamic changes of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of pH1N1 strains that spread in two metropolitan areas -Taipei and Kaohsiung. We observed cumulative increases of amino acid substitutions of both HA and NA that were higher in the post–peak than in the pre-peak period of the epidemic. About 14.94% and 3.44% of 174 isolates had one and two amino acids changes, respective, in the four antigenic sites. One unique adaptive mutation of HA2 (E374K) was first detected three weeks before the epidemic peak. This mutation evolved through the epidemic, and finally emerged as the major circulated strain, with significantly higher frequency in the post-peak period than in the pre-peak (64.65% vs 9.28%, p<0.0001). E374K persisted until ten months post-nationwide vaccination without further antigenic changes (e.g. prior to the highest selective pressure). In public health measures, the epidemic peaked at seven weeks after oseltamivir treatment was initiated. The emerging E374K mutants spread before the first peak of school class suspension, extended their survival in high-density population areas before vaccination, dominated in the second wave of class suspension, and were fixed as herd immunity developed. The tempo-spatial spreading of E374K mutants was more concentrated during the post–peak (p = 0.000004) in seven districts with higher spatial clusters (p<0.001). This is the first study examining viral changes during the naïve phase of a pandemic of influenza through integrated virological/serological/clinical surveillance, tempo-spatial analysis, and intervention policies. The vaccination increased the percentage of E374K mutants (22.86% vs 72.34%, p<0.001) and significantly elevated the frequency of mutations in Sa antigenic site (2.36% vs 23.40%, p<0.001). Future pre-vaccination public health efforts should monitor amino acids of HA and NA of pandemic influenza viruses isolated at exponential and peak phases in areas with high cluster cases."
https://openalex.org/W2011504889,"High and low protein diets fed to pregnant adolescent sows led to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). To explore underlying mechanisms, sow plasma metabolite and hormone concentrations were analyzed during different pregnancy stages and correlated with litter weight (LW) at birth, sow body weight and back fat thickness. Sows were fed diets with low (6.5%, LP), adequate (12.1%, AP), and high (30%, HP) protein levels, made isoenergetic by adjusted carbohydrate content. At −5, 24, 66, and 108 days post coitum (dpc) fasted blood was collected. At 92 dpc, diurnal metabolic profiles were determined. Fasted serum urea and plasma glucagon were higher due to the HP diet. High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), %HDLC and cortisol were reduced in HP compared with AP sows. Lowest concentrations were observed for serum urea and protein, plasma insulin-like growth factor-I, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and progesterone in LP compared with AP and HP sows. Fasted plasma glucose, insulin and leptin concentrations were unchanged. Diurnal metabolic profiles showed lower glucose in HP sows whereas non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations were higher in HP compared with AP and LP sows. In HP and LP sows, urea concentrations were 300% and 60% of AP sows, respectively. Plasma total cholesterol was higher in LP than in AP and HP sows. In AP sows, LW correlated positively with insulin and insulin/glucose and negatively with glucagon/insulin at 66 dpc, whereas in HP sows LW associated positively with NEFA. In conclusion, IUGR in sows fed high protein∶low carbohydrate diet was probably due to glucose and energy deficit whereas in sows with low protein∶high carbohydrate diet it was possibly a response to a deficit of indispensable amino acids which impaired lipoprotein metabolism and favored maternal lipid disposal."
https://openalex.org/W2067482191,"An increasing number of malignancies has been shown to be initiated and propelled by small subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSC). However, whether tumor aggressiveness is driven by CSC and by what extent this property may be relevant within the tumor mass is still unsettled. To address this issue, we isolated a rare tumor cell population on the basis of its CD44+CD24− phenotype from the human androgen-independent prostate carcinoma cell line DU145 and established its CSC properties. The behavior of selected CSC was investigated with respect to the bulk DU145 cells. The injection of CSC in nude mice generated highly vascularized tumors infiltrating the adjacent tissues, showing high density of neuroendocrine cells and expressing low levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin as well as high levels of vimentin. On the contrary, when a comparable number of unsorted DU145 cells were injected the resulting tumors were less aggressive. To investigate the different features of tumors in vivo, the influence of differentiated tumor cells on CSC was examined in vitro by growing CSC in the absence or presence of conditioned medium from DU145 cells. CSC grown in permissive conditions differentiated into cell populations with features similar to those of cells held in aggressive tumors generated from CSC injection. Differently, conditioned medium induced CSC to differentiate into a cell phenotype comparable to cells of scarcely aggressive tumors originated from bulk DU145 cell injection. These findings show for the first time that CSC are able to generate differentiated cells expressing either highly or scarcely aggressive phenotype, thus influencing prostate cancer progression. The fate of CSC was determined by signals released from tumor environment. Moreover, using microarray analysis we selected some molecules which could be involved in this cell-to-cell signaling, hypothesizing their potential value for prognostic or therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W1997331485,"Quantifying effects of toxicant exposure on metabolic processes is crucial to predicting microbial growth patterns in different environments. Mechanistic models, such as those based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, can link physiological processes to microbial growth.Here we expand the DEB framework to include explicit consideration of the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Extensions considered are: (i) additional terms in the equation for the ""hazard rate"" that quantifies mortality risk; (ii) a variable representing environmental degradation; (iii) a mechanistic description of toxic effects linked to increase in ROS production and aging acceleration, and to non-competitive inhibition of transport channels; (iv) a new representation of the ""lag time"" based on energy required for acclimation. We estimate model parameters using calibrated Pseudomonas aeruginosa optical density growth data for seven levels of cadmium exposure. The model reproduces growth patterns for all treatments with a single common parameter set, and bacterial growth for treatments of up to 150 mg(Cd)/L can be predicted reasonably well using parameters estimated from cadmium treatments of 20 mg(Cd)/L and lower. Our approach is an important step towards connecting levels of biological organization in ecotoxicology. The presented model reveals possible connections between processes that are not obvious from purely empirical considerations, enables validation and hypothesis testing by creating testable predictions, and identifies research required to further develop the theory."
https://openalex.org/W2026463142,"Background The purpose of the study is to elucidate the sequence composition of the short arm of rye chromosome 1 (Secale cereale) with special focus on its gene content, because this portion of the rye genome is an integrated part of several hundreds of bread wheat varieties worldwide. Methodology/Principal Findings Multiple Displacement Amplification of 1RS DNA, obtained from flow sorted 1RS chromosomes, using 1RS ditelosomic wheat-rye addition line, and subsequent Roche 454FLX sequencing of this DNA yielded 195,313,589 bp sequence information. This quantity of sequence information resulted in 0.43× sequence coverage of the 1RS chromosome arm, permitting the identification of genes with estimated probability of 95%. A detailed analysis revealed that more than 5% of the 1RS sequence consisted of gene space, identifying at least 3,121 gene loci representing 1,882 different gene functions. Repetitive elements comprised about 72% of the 1RS sequence, Gypsy/Sabrina (13.3%) being the most abundant. More than four thousand simple sequence repeat (SSR) sites mostly located in gene related sequence reads were identified for possible marker development. The existence of chloroplast insertions in 1RS has been verified by identifying chimeric chloroplast-genomic sequence reads. Synteny analysis of 1RS to the full genomes of Oryza sativa and Brachypodium distachyon revealed that about half of the genes of 1RS correspond to the distal end of the short arm of rice chromosome 5 and the proximal region of the long arm of Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 2. Comparison of the gene content of 1RS to 1HS barley chromosome arm revealed high conservation of genes related to chromosome 5 of rice. Conclusions The present study revealed the gene content and potential gene functions on this chromosome arm and demonstrated numerous sequence elements like SSRs and gene-related sequences, which can be utilised for future research as well as in breeding of wheat and rye."
https://openalex.org/W2117375988,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a multifunctional neuropeptide with demonstrated immunosuppressive and neuroprotective activities. It has been shown to inhibit Amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced neurodegeneration by indirectly suppressing the production and release of a variety of inflammatory and neurotoxic factors by activated microglia. We demonstrated that VIP markedly increased microglial phagocytosis of fibrillar Aβ42 and that this enhanced phagocytotic activity depended on activation of the Protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. In addition, VIP suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and nitric oxide(NO) from microglia activated by combined treatment with fibrillar Aβ42 and low dose interferon-γ (IFN-γ). We utilized an adenovirus-mediated gene delivery method to overexpress VIP constitutively in the hippocampus of APPswPS1 transgenic mice. The Aβ load was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of this animal model of Alzheimer's disease, possibly due to the accumulation and activation of cd11b-immunoactive microglial cells. The modulation of microglial activation, phagocytosis, and secretion by VIP is a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease(AD)."
https://openalex.org/W2052869741,"Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering skin disease associated with autoantibodies against the dermal-epidermal junction. Passive transfer of antibodies against BP180/collagen (C) XVII, a major hemidesmosomal pemphigoid antigen, into neonatal mice results in dermal-epidermal separation upon applying gentle pressure to their skin, but not in spontaneous skin blistering. In addition, this neonatal mouse model precludes treatment and observation of diseased animals beyond 2–3 days. Therefore, in the present study we have developed a new disease model in mice reproducing the spontaneous blistering and the chronic course characteristic of the human condition. Adult mice were pre-immunized with rabbit IgG followed by injection of BP180/CXVII rabbit IgG. Mice pre-immunized against rabbit IgG and injected 6 times every second day with the BP180/CXVII-specific antibodies (n = 35) developed spontaneous sustained blistering of the skin, while mice pre-immunized and then treated with normal rabbit IgG (n = 5) did not. Blistering was associated with IgG and complement C3 deposits at the epidermal basement membrane and recruitment of inflammatory cells, and was partly dependent on Ly-6G-positive cells. We further used this new experimental model to investigate the therapeutic potential of luteolin, a plant flavonoid with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties and good safety profile, in experimental BP. Luteolin inhibited the Fcγ-dependent respiratory burst in immune complex-stimulated granulocytes and the autoantibody-induced dermal-epidermal separation in skin cryosections, but was not effective in suppressing the skin blistering in vivo. These studies establish a robust animal model that will be a useful tool for dissecting the mechanisms of blister formation and will facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for managing pemphigoid diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2090824261,"The epidemiology and ecology of West Nile virus (WNV) have not yet been completely described. In particular, the specific roles of climate and water in the landscape in the occurrence of human WNV cases remain unknown. This study used Poisson regression to describe the relationships between WNV cases and temperature, precipitation, and the hydrogeography of the landscape in New York State from 2000 to 2010. Fully adjusted models showed that hydrogeographic area was significantly inversely associated with WNV cases (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.99; 95% C.I. = 0.98-0.997, p = 0.04), such that each one square kilometer increase in hydrogeographic area was associated with a 1% decrease in WNV incidence. This association was independent of both temperature, which was also associated with WNV incidence (IRR = 2.06; 95% C.I. = 1.84-2.31, p<0.001), and precipitation, which was not (IRR = 1.0; 95% C.I. = 0.99-1.01, p = 0.16). While the results are only suggestive due to the county-level aggregated data, these findings do identify a potentially important surveillance signal in the landscape epidemiology of WNV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2054037057,"The genus Henipavirus includes Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), for which fruit bats (particularly those of the genus Pteropus) are considered to be the wildlife reservoir. The recognition of henipaviruses occurring across a wider geographic and host range suggests the possibility of the virus entering the United Kingdom (UK). To estimate the likelihood of henipaviruses entering the UK, a qualitative release assessment was undertaken. To facilitate the release assessment, the world was divided into four zones according to location of outbreaks of henipaviruses, isolation of henipaviruses, proximity to other countries where incidents of henipaviruses have occurred and the distribution of Pteropus spp. fruit bats. From this release assessment, the key findings are that the importation of fruit from Zone 1 and 2 and bat bushmeat from Zone 1 each have a Low annual probability of release of henipaviruses into the UK. Similarly, the importation of bat meat from Zone 2, horses and companion animals from Zone 1 and people travelling from Zone 1 and entering the UK was estimated to pose a Very Low probability of release. The annual probability of release for all other release routes was assessed to be Negligible. It is recommended that the release assessment be periodically re-assessed to reflect changes in knowledge and circumstances over time."
https://openalex.org/W2077412052,"The compliance with influenza vaccination is poor among health care workers (HCWs) due to misconceptions about safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccine. We proposed an educational prospective study to demonstrate to HCWs that influenza vaccine is safe and that other respiratory viruses (RV) are the cause of respiratory symptoms in the months following influenza vaccination. 398 HCWs were surveyed for adverse events (AE) occurring within 48 h of vaccination. AE were reported by 30% of the HCWs. No severe AE was observed. A subset of 337 HCWs was followed up during four months, twice a week, for the detection of respiratory symptoms. RV was diagnosed by direct immunofluorescent assay (DFA) and real time PCR in symptomatic HCWs. Influenza A was detected in five episodes of respiratory symptoms (5.3%) and other RV in 26 (27.9%) episodes. The incidence density of influenza and other RV was 4.3 and 10.8 episodes per 100 HCW-month, respectively. The educational nature of the present study may persuade HCWs to develop a more positive attitude to influenza vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2085108881,"It has long been recognized that divalent cations modulate cell excitability. Sensory nerve excitability is of critical importance to peripheral diseases associated with pain, sensory dysfunction and evoked reflexes. Thus we have studied the role these cations play on dissociated sensory nerve activity. Withdrawal of both Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) from external solutions activates over 90% of dissociated mouse sensory neurons. Imaging studies demonstrate a Na(+) influx that then causes depolarization-mediated activation of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (Ca(V)), which allows Ca(2+) influx upon divalent re-introduction. Inhibition of Ca(V) (ω-conotoxin, nifedipine) or Na(V) (tetrodotoxin, lidocaine) fails to reduce the Na(+) influx. The Ca(2+) influx is inhibited by Ca(V) inhibitors but not by TRPM7 inhibition (spermine) or store-operated channel inhibition (SKF96365). Withdrawal of either Mg(2+) or Ca(2+) alone fails to evoke cation influxes in vagal sensory neurons. In electrophysiological studies of dissociated mouse vagal sensory neurons, withdrawal of both Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) from external solutions evokes a large slowly-inactivating voltage-gated current (I(DF)) that cannot be accounted for by an increased negative surface potential. Withdrawal of Ca(2+) alone fails to evoke I(DF). Evidence suggests I(DF) is a non-selective cation current. The I(DF) is not reduced by inhibition of Na(V) (lidocaine, riluzole), Ca(V) (cilnidipine, nifedipine), K(V) (tetraethylammonium, 4-aminopyridine) or TRPM7 channels (spermine). In summary, sensory neurons express a novel voltage-gated cation channel that is inhibited by external Ca(2+) (IC(50)∼0.5 µM) or Mg(2+) (IC(50)∼3 µM). Activation of this putative channel evokes substantial cation fluxes in sensory neurons."
