https://openalex.org/W1647336621,"The sialyl Lewis x (NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)Glc-NAc) determinants serve as ligands in the selectin-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to activated endothelium or platelets. In our efforts to identify glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of those ligands, we achieved expression cloning of a novel human alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase termed Fuc-TVII from a THP-1 cDNA library by enrichment of the Namalwa cells highly expressing that determinant with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Expression of the COOH-terminal catalytic domain of Fuc-TVII showed an alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase activity for a type II oligosaccharide with a terminal alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid among various acceptors, consistent with that in vivo acceptor specificity. Alignment of the primary sequences of five alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferases and assignment of the chromosomal location of Fuc-TVII gene, together with that acceptor specificity, indicate that Fuc-TVII consists of a unique class of the alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase family. Determination of the expression levels of these alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferases in various cells revealed that both Fuc-TVII and a myeloid fucosyltransferase Fuc-TIV were significantly expressed in myeloid lineage cells. Fuc-TVII-transfected Namalwa cells exhibited significant binding to E-selectin in contrast to little binding of the Fuc-TIV-transfected cells. These results suggest that Fuc-TVII may participate in the biosynthesis of the selectin ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1550325341,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta) is a strong and rapid inducer of several genes coding for extracellular matrix components, such as type I collagen. We report here that TGF-beta stimulates transcription of the human alpha 2(I) collagen gene (COL1A2) promoter by increasing the affinity of an Sp1-containing protein complex for its cognate DNA-binding site. Cell transfection experiments mapped the TGF-beta-responsive element (TbRE) of the COL1A2 promoter to a 131 bp region that contains at least two cis-acting elements. Insertion of the TbRE upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter conferred TGF-beta inducibility to the otherwise unresponsive thymidine kinase promoter. Footprinting assays revealed that the TbRE contains two neighboring protein-bound sequences, termed Box 3A and Box B. Within Box 3A is an Sp1 recognition sequence whose structural integrity is required for nuclear protein binding in vitro, and for promoter inducibility in vivo. Gel mobility shift assays documented increased binding to the TbRE of nuclear proteins from TGF-beta-treated cells compared with those from TGF-beta-untreated fibroblasts. There was, however, no binding increase with Box 3A alone or with an Sp1 oligonucleotide. Thus, the results strongly suggest a functional interaction between Sp1 and other components of the TbRE complex in mediating TGF-beta stimulation of COL1A2 gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1517822715,"We report that activators and inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) and protein phosphatases regulate the activity of a cloned rat brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (GAT1) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Four compounds known to activate PKC increased GABA uptake 2-3.5-fold over basal control levels. Inhibition of PKC by bisindolylmaleimide reduced basal GABA uptake 80% and blocked the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced stimulation of transport. Okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, stimulated transport 2.5-fold; a 4-fold increase in GABA uptake occurred when oocytes were treated with cyclosporin A, a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2B. Modulation resulted in changes to Vmax but not to Km and was influenced by the functional expression level of the transporter protein; as expression level increased, the ability to up-regulate transporter activity decreased. Down-regulation of transporter activity was independent of expression level. Modulation did not occur through phosphorylation of the three consensus PKC sites predicted by the primary protein sequence since their removal had no effect on the susceptibility of the transporter to modulation by PMA or bisindolylmaleimide. Subcellular fractionation of oocyte membranes demonstrated that under basal level conditions, the majority of GAT1 was targeted to a cytoplasmic compartment corresponding to the trans-Golgi or low density vesicles. Stimulation of PKC with PMA resulted in a translocation of transporters from this compartment to the plasma membrane. At higher expression levels of GAT1 protein, a larger portion of GAT1 was found on the plasma membrane during basal level conditions and treatment with bisindolylmaleimide resulted in removal of these transporters from the plasma membrane. At expression levels demonstrated to be resistant to modulation by PMA, PMA-treatment still resulted in translocation of transporters from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Thus, the inability of PMA to increase uptake at high expression of the GAT1 protein is due to saturation at a step subsequent to translocation. These findings 1) demonstrate the presence of a novel regulated secretory pathway in oocytes and 2) suggest a modulatory mechanism for neurotransmitter transporters that could have significant effects upon synaptic function."

https://openalex.org/W1594709370,"We evaluated the effects of a transient cold shock followed by recovery and incubation at 37 degrees C on the regulation of heat shock gene expression in the IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts and HeLa cells in tissue culture. We showed that preincubation of cells at 4 degrees C induced the synthesis and accumulation of the heat shock proteins (HSPs) upon recovery at 37 degrees C, and the degree of this induction was directly related to the time that the cells spent at 4 degrees C. Assays on the abundance of the hsp 70 transcript, the hsp 70 gene promoter activity, and the trimerization and activation of heat shock factor (HSF) to bind to its consensus heat shock element (HSE) provided evidence that this induction of the heat shock response in cells recovering from a transient cold shock is attributable to a transcriptional event mediated by the activation of HSF. Further, the induction was a response to the temperature upshift from 4 to 37 degrees C as opposed to the 4 degrees C treatment itself; quantitation of the HSE-binding activity of cells incubated at 4 degrees C without recovery and incubation at 37 degrees C gave no evidence of an activated response. Analysis of the effects of protein synthesis inhibitors demonstrated that neither cycloheximide nor puromycin was effective in blocking the induction of HSE-binding activity in cells recovering from a transient cold shock. Experiments on the time course and temperature dependence of this induction of HSE-binding activity showed that the onset, magnitude, and duration of this induction were directly proportional to the severity of the cold stress (measured by time and temperature). We discuss the possible mechanism(s) involved in this induction of the heat shock genes at 37 degrees C by a transient cold shock and the biological implications of this observation."

https://openalex.org/W1523040131,"Permeabilized rat kidney cells rapidly released glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) following stimulation with peptide growth factors (Stanton, R.C., Seifter, J.L., Boxer, D.C., Zimmerman, E., and Cantley, L. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12442-12448). To evaluate the signal transduction pathways mediating release of G6PD, two cell lines transfected with wild type or mutant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors (PDGFR) were studied using two permeabilization protocols. G6PD release was evaluated by enzyme activity and Western blot analysis. PDGF caused a significant increase in G6PD release in 1 min in cells transfected with wild type PDGFR. PDGF did not stimulate G6PD release in cells transfected with tyrosine kinase-deficient PDGFR. PDGF did not stimulate G6PD release in cells transfected with partially autophosphorylation-deficient PDGFR in which four known signaling proteins do not associate with the PDGFR. The PDGF-stimulated release of G6PD was partially restored in PDGFR mutants in which either phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase or phospholipase C gamma 1 could associate with the PDGFR. Lastly, there was no basal or PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of G6PD. We conclude that release of G6PD: 1) requires intrinsic PDGFR tyrosine kinase activity; 2) requires PDGFR autophosphorylation; 3) is mediated by signaling proteins that associate with the PDGFR; 4) is not mediated by direct phosphorylation of G6PD."
https://openalex.org/W1537370330,"Multiple mechanisms of regulation in the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis were revealed by exploring the effects of choline and inositol on this pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. At exogenous choline concentrations below 100 microM, phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase was rate-limiting; at higher choline concentrations the conversion of choline to phosphocholine by choline kinase became rate-limiting. Choline and inositol were found to regulate choline uptake; this established another regulatory mechanism by which PC synthesis is regulated in yeast. Inositol addition did not immediately affect labeled choline uptake or its incorporation into PC in actively dividing cells; however, preculturing the cells in the presence of choline decreased the rate of choline uptake, and this effect was amplified by the concomitant addition of inositol and choline. Additionally, a growth phase dependent effect of inositol supplementation was observed. Inositol addition to stationary phase cells resulted in an increase in choline uptake and subsequent PC production in these cells. This increase was shown to be due to an increase in the rate of choline transport into the cell. In the presence of inositol, choline transport is the main regulatory mechanism controlling flux through the CDP-choline pathway in S. cerevisiae. Inositol supplementation resulted in changes in the levels of enzyme activity detected in vitro. However, the effects observed in vivo correlated exclusively with changes in choline uptake. Choline transporter assays were consistent with these results. Since both the CPT1 and EPT1 gene products catalyze the cholinephosphotransferase reaction in vitro (Hjelmstad, R. H., and Bell, R. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4357-4365), the effect of inositol on these two separate routes for PC biosynthesis was investigated. The data revealed that only cells harboring a functional CPT1 gene synthesized PC in vivo. These cells (ept1-delta 1::URA3) also displayed an identical mode of regulation in response to inositol as did cells containing an intact EPT1 gene (wild type) indicating there is no requirement for an alternate functional CDP-amino-alcohol pathway for inositol to regulate PC synthesis via the CDP-choline pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1524779116,"Membrane depolarization is a critical element of neuronal signaling. In this study, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) gene by depolarization were investigated. In PC-12 cells, potassium-induced membrane depolarization increased expression of a CRH-reporter construct in a cAMP-dependent manner. This synergistic activation was mediated via calcium influx, predominantly via L-type calcium channels, and calmodulin. RNase protection assays demonstrated increased levels of CRH-reporter transcripts in stably transfected cells after treatment with cAMP and potassium, with the induced transcripts initiating at the major transcription initiation site of the human CRH gene. At the genomic level, the CRH cAMP-responsive element conferred both positive cAMP and synergistic cAMP/depolarization regulation to a heterologous promoter. Additionally, DNase I protection assays demonstrated similar nuclear protein/DNA binding profiles across the cAMP-responsive element after treatment of PC-12 cells with potassium or potassium/cAMP. These results support a model in which the protein(s) binding to the cAMP-responsive element integrates signals initiated by multiple pathways (cAMP and calcium) and transmits that integrated signal to the basal transcription machinery, resulting in increased levels of gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1535466932,"Recently, we cloned and characterized cDNA encoding a novel, protein kinase C (designated PKC1B) from Caenorhabditis elegans. PKC1B (707 amino acid residues) is a developmentally regulated, calcium-independent kinase that is expressed exclusively in sensory neurons and related interneurons. We have now discovered a mechanism by which a second, distinct mRNA (PKC1A mRNA) with increased protein coding potential is generated from the C. elegans PKC1 gene. PKC1A mRNA is produced in a process that involves the utilization of an alternative, distal promoter, the incorporation of two unique exons into the mRNA, and alternative cis/trans splicing. Diversity among PKC1 gene transcripts is increased substantially by trans-splicing. The 5' end of PKC1A mRNA contains an acceptor site that is modified by the addition of either a classical spliced leader sequence 2 or one of four novel spliced leaders. PKC1A mRNA encodes a predicted kinase that contains the entire sequence of PKC1B as well as an N-terminal extension of 56 residues. The extension contains a preponderance of basic amino acids. The levels of transcripts arising from the distal (1A) and proximal (1B) promoters for the PKC1 gene are differentially regulated during C. elegans development. The ratio of 1B mRNA:1A mRNA varies from 40:1 to unity as the nematodes progress from early larval stages to mature adults. The novel exons in the PKC1A structural gene are not contiguous with the PKC1A promoter but are instead positioned downstream from a second gene, kinase upstream gene-1, in the context of a multicystronic operon. PKC1A and kinase upstream gene-1 mRNAs are coordinately expressed in a fixed ratio throughout C. elegans post-embryonic development, suggesting that a shared upstream promoter regulates transcription of both genes. Finally, PKC1A and PKC1B mRNA levels are differentially regulated by phorbol esters in a process that may involve the participation of another PKC isoform that is analogous to mammalian PKC delta."

https://openalex.org/W1502761053,"Abstract Binding of urinary protein C inhibitor (PCI) to cultured human epithelial kidney tumor cells (TCL-598) was studied. Binding was dose-dependent, time-dependent, and saturable. Heparin interfered in a dose-dependent way with PCI binding to TCL-598 as did heparan sulfate and to a lesser degree also dermatan sulfate. Pretreatment of TCL-598 with protamine sulfate inhibited subsequent binding of PCI in a dose-dependent manner and > 100 micrograms/ml protamine sulfate reduced binding of PCI to < 10% of the control. Binding of 125I-PCI was specific, and bound 125I-PCI was recovered from the cells by heparin treatment or detached together with intact cells by EDTA treatment, migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the same mobility (M(r) = 57,000) as unbound 125I-PCI. Furthermore, cell-bound PCI was functionally active as judged from its ability to inhibit the amidolytic activity of urokinase, and its inhibitory activity was stimulated approximately 3-4-fold as compared to fluid-phase PCI. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that PCI-antigen presented to the cells from the luminal side bound exclusively to that surface in native as well as in prefixed cells. This binding of PCI was abolished in the presence of heparin (50 micrograms/ml) and after pretreatment of the cells either with protamine sulfate (400 micrograms/ml) or with heparinase III (0.5 unit/ml). A slight decrease in PCI binding was seen after pretreatment of the cells with chondroitinase ABC and chondroitinase AC. In contrast, binding of PCI to extracellular matrices of TCL-598 was decreased to approximately 70% after chondroitinase ABC treatment of the extracellular matrices, whereas both heparinase III or chondroitinase AC treatment only reduced matrix-bound PCI to approximately 95%. These data suggest that heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans are predominantly involved in binding of PCI to the luminal side of TCL-598, while dermatan sulfate-containing proteoglycans, the overall predominant PCI-binding proteoglycans in TCL extracts, are responsible for PCI binding to the extracellular matrix. Heparan sulfate, however, exposed to an environment containing PCI under physiological conditions, might localize PCI and modulate its target enzyme specificity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1597676455,"The neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM mediates intercellular adhesion by homophilic binding and its homophilic binding site has been mapped to a decapeptide sequence 243-KYSFNYDGSE-252 located within the third immunoglobulin-like domain of chick NCAM. To investigate the relationship between homophilic binding and NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth, mutations were created in the binding site of NCAM-140 cDNA. Mutant NCAMs were expressed in L cells, and their ability to promote neurite outgrowth from chick retinal ganglion cells was assayed in coculture systems. Mutations that resulted in the loss of NCAM homophilic binding failed to promote neurite outgrowth from retinal cells. Alternatively, synthetic peptides containing the decapeptide sequence of the homophilic binding site were used to block NCAM homophilic interaction. Peptides that inhibited NCAM-NCAM binding also blocked neurite elongation. However, the peptide P5 (243-KYSFNYDGSELIIKKVDKSDE-263), despite being an inhibitor of NCAM-NCAM binding, induced the sprouting of multiple neurites. Moreover, peptide P5 stimulated a 2-fold increase in neurite-bearing cells, suggesting that P5 is a potent inducer of neurite outgrowth. Only E4-E6 retinal cells could be induced by P5, corresponding closely to their NCAM-responsive embryonic stages. The P5 effects were inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating the involvement of a G-protein-dependent pathway. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a direct role of the NCAM homophilic binding site in the regulation of neurite outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W1537041104,"In rodents, mast cell progenitors differentiate into distinct mucosal and serosal phenotypes which differ markedly in their functional responses to antigenic and peptidergic stimulation. Although the molecular basis of mast cell differentiation or functional specialization is unknown, it is possible that regulation of calcium entry contributes to one or both processes. The prolonged secretory response of mucosal mast cells (MMC) and the antigen-elicited synthesis of interleukin-3 by immature MMC both require a rise of cytoplasmic calcium sustained by Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. This Ca2+ entry is highly sensitive to membrane potential, affording a possible site for regulation of mast cell function by receptor-linked ion channels. We found that rat interleukin-3-dependent bone marrow-derived mast cells of the mucosal phenotype expressed two K+ conductances, neither of which is present in the prototype serosal mast cell from rat peritoneum. An inwardly rectifying K+ conductance was constitutively active and a latent outwardly rectifying K+ conductance was elicited rapidly upon ligation of cell surface adenosine or P2 purinergic receptors linked to G proteins of the Gi family. Stimulation of P2 receptors dramatically potentiated antigen-triggered secretion in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, suggesting that activation of the outwardly rectifying K+ channel may regulate antigen-dependent functions of MMC."
