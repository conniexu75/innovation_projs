https://openalex.org/W1991630769,"In cultured human fibroblasts, each LDL receptor mediates the internalization of approximately 100 particles of LDL every 20 hr. We provide evidence that this reutilization of LDL receptors involves the recycling of receptors into and out of the cell and that the carboxylic ionophore monensin blocks the return of the receptors to the surface. In the presence of monensin and LDL, 75% of the receptors disappeared from the cell surface within 15 min and more than 90% disappeared within 60 min. The receptors that left the surface were trapped intracellularly within perinuclear vacuoles, as visualized by indirect immunofluorescence with the use of an antibody to the LDL receptor. In the absence of LDL, monensin caused about 50% of the receptors to be trapped intracellularly within 15 min. The receptors that remained on the surface after monensin treatment could be trapped within the cell if LDL was added subsequently in the continued presence of monensin. Monensin did not decrease surface LDL receptors in fibroblasts from a patient (J. D.) with the internalization-defective form of familial hypercholesterolemia. In these mutant cells, LDL receptors are not localized to coated pits. The current data are interpreted to indicate that: in normal fibroblasts about 50% of surface LDL receptors recycle continuously into and out of the cell in the absence of LDL; the remaining 50% of surface receptors can be induced to recycle by the presence of LDL; and monensin interrupts this recycling by preventing the receptor from returning to the surface, thereby causing the receptors to accumulate within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2064883409,"Vinculin, a protein associated with the cytoplasmic face of the focal adhesion plaques which anchor actin-containing microfilaments to the plasma membrane and attach a cell to the substratum, contains 8-fold more phosphotyrosine in cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus than in uninfected cells. Because the transforming protein of RSV, p60src, is a protein kinase that modifies cellular proteins through the phosphorylation of tyrosine and because phosphotyrosine is a very rare modified amino acid, this result is a very rare modified amino acid, this result suggests that vinculin is a primary substrate of p60src. Only trace amounts of phosphotyrosine were detected in myosin heavy chains, alpha-actinin, filamin, and the intermediate filament protein vimentin. The modification of vinculin by p60src may be responsible in part for the disruption of the microfilament organization and for the changes in cell shape and adhesiveness which accompany transformation by Rous sarcoma virus."
https://openalex.org/W2024651141,"We have analyzed the DNA sequences required for termination of Xenopus 5S RNA synthesis in vitro. Termination occurs within clusters of four or more consecutive T residues in the noncoding DNA strand sequence. The 3' flanking sequence following the gene is not required for termination. The distance between the T cluster and the site of transcription initiation as well as the exact nucleotide sequences preceding the T cluster can be varied without impairing termination. Thus sequence signals for accurate initiation and termination of transcription are separable and can function independently. No significant dyad symmetry near the end of the gene appears to be required, in contrast to termination sites in procaryotes. However, the nucleotide sequences adjacent to the T cluster influence the efficiency of transcription termination. Efficient termination is observed whenever GC-rich sequences surround the T cluster. The inefficient termination of transcription of X. laevis major oocyte type 5S RNA genes appears to result from groups of two or more consecutive A residues within three nucleotides preceding or following the T cluster. Other variables, such as the temperature, the nucleotide concentration and the addition of alpha-amanitin, also influence the efficiency of termination."
https://openalex.org/W2077587402,"We report a system for investigating promoters of eucaryotic cell and virus genes based on analyses of the regulation of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinases whose structural gene sequences have been fused to the promoter of the gene under study. In infected cells, the polypeptides specified by HSV-1 form at least three groups, α, β and γ, whose synthesis is coordinately regulated and sequentially ordered at the transcriptional level. To identify the DNA sequence responsible for the regulation of transcription of α genes, we fused the sequence encoding the 5′ end of an α gene to the structural gene sequence of the thymidine kinase, a β gene. The resultant recombinant DNA was inserted into the viral genome and was also used to convert Ltk− cells to tk+ phenotype. In cells infected with recombinant virus, the thymidine kinase gene was regulated and expressed as an α gene—that is, it was transcribed and processed in the absence of prior infected cell protein synthesis. Moreover, mRNA selected by hybridization to sequences encoding the thymidine kinase contains at its 5′ terminus sequences homologous to the donor sequence encoding the 5′ terminus of the α mRNA. In converted tk+ cells, the fused thymidine kinase gene, like the wild-type gene, is stimulated by superinfection with the tk− virus. However, the stimulation is many times greater and is due to non-α-gene products, whereas in cells converted by the wild-type gene, the stimulation is by a gene products. We conclude that the α genes are identified for transcription by sequences at or near those encoding the 5′ terminus of the mRNA, and transposition of these sequences to a β gene is all that is required to convert it to an α gene. Transcription of α genes appears to be regulated by non-α-gene products, which could be contained within the structure of the virion. In converted Ltk+ cells, the thymidine kinase gene uses its own promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1488147530,"Hepatic membranes from adult dog livers have receptors which bind to lipoproteins containing the E apoprotein (the apo-E HDLc) but lack specific receptors for the apo-B-containing low density lipoproteins (LDL). Scatchard analysis of direct binding data for 125I-apo-E-HDLc revealed nonlinearity of the binding which could be resolved into two components, suggesting the presence of two separate binding sites. The binding site for apo-E HDLc that possessed the highest affinity (Kd = 0.23 x 10(-9) M) was calcium-dependent and was sensitive to proteolytic digestion with pronase. The lower affinity (Kd = 20 x 10(-9) M) binding site for apo-E HDLc did not require calcium and was resistant to pronase digestion. Chemical modification of the arginyl or lysyl residues of the apo-E HDLc prevented the HDLc from binding to the higher affinity receptor but had no effect on their binding to the lower affinity site. Adult canine liver membranes also bound canine 125I-HDL. However, the binding of HDL was of lower affinity (Kd = 8.2 x 10(-8) M), did not require calcium, was not blocked by modification of the lysyl or arginyl residues, and may not be of physiologic significance. Although the liver membranes from normal chow-fed adult dogs did not bind canine LDL, it was possible to demonstrate specific high affinity binding of LDL under certain metabolic conditions in dogs. When adult dogs were treated with the hypocholesterolemic agent cholestyramine, the liver membranes from these animals readily bound canine LDL. The Kd for canine LDL binding to these liver membranes was 15 x 10(-9) M. Furthermore, it was possible to demonstrate high affinity binding of LDL to the liver membranes from young rapidly growing puppies (Kd = 11 x 10(-9) M). The binding of the 125I-LDL to the liver membranes from the adult cholestyramine-treated dogs or from the puppies appeared to be mediated by apo-B,E receptors which resembled the LDL receptor of human skin fibroblasts. The 125I-LDL binding of these liver membranes was competitively inhibited by the addition of unlabeled LDL or apo-E HDLc. On the other hand, 125I-apo-E HDLc, capable of binding to the apo-B,E or to the apo-E receptors, were only partially displaced by the addition of unlabeled LDL but were totally displaced by apo-E HDLc. In summary, the adult dog liver possessed only the apo-E receptor. An apo-B,E receptor capable of binding LDL and HDLc could be induced by treatment of adult dogs with cholestyramine. Similarly, the liver membranes of young growing puppies possessed the apo-E and po-B,E receptors and were capable of binding both apo-E HDLc and LDL. The mechanism responsible for the control of the expression of the hepatic apo-B,E and/or apo-E receptors remains to be determined. These data indicate that a unique receptor capable of interacting specifically with apo-E-containing lipoproteins, and not with apo-B-containing lipoproteins (LDL), exists in the adult canine liver."
https://openalex.org/W1980451107,"We have tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation patterns are replicated in the somatic cells of vertebrates. Using M-Hpa II, the modification enzyme from Haemophilus parainfluenzae which methylates the internal cytosine residues in the sequence 5'CCGG 3' GGCC, we methylated bacteriophage phi X174 RF DNA and the cloned chicken thymidine kinase (tk) gene in vitro and then introduced these DNAs and unmethylated controls into tk- cultured mouse cells by DNA-mediated transformation. Twenty-five cell generations later, the state of methylation of transferred DNA was examined by restriction endonuclease analysis and blot hybridization. We conclude that methylation at Hpa II sites is replicated by these cultured cells but not with 100% fidelity. We have also noted that methylation of the cloned chicken tk gene decreases its apparent transformation efficiency relative to unmethylated molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1500990165,"The structure of receptors for insulin-like growth factors in rat liver plasma membranes and the BRL 3A2 rat liver cell line has been examined by chemical cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Two receptor subtypes have been identified: (i) 125I multiplication-stimulating activity cross-linked to liver membranes or intact cells appeared in a complex of Mr = 260,000 (reduced) and 220,000 (nonreduced) and (ii) 125I-insulin-like growth factor I cross-linked to BRL 3A2 cells appeared predominantly in two bands of Mr greater than 300,000 without disulfide reduction and in a Mr = 130,000 complex following reduction. The two subtypes of insulin-like growth factor receptors identified by structural analysis correspond to previously observed differences in their specificity for insulin and insulin-like growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2006568501,"The nusA gene protein of E. coli is involved in regulating termination of transcription in vivo. In vitro it causes termination of transcription in the tR2 region of the PR operon of bacteriophage lambda. We have now used a nusA-Sepharose affinity column and gradient sedimentation experiments to show that the nusA protein binds directly, with great specificity, and with equimolar stoichiometry to the E. coli RNA polymerase core enzyme beta beta' alpha 2. The RNA polymerase sigma subunit is able to displace the nusA protein from a beta beta' alpha 2-nusA complex, regenerating RNA polymerase holoenzyme beta beta alpha 2-sigma able selectively to initiate transcription at promoter sites. It is proposed that beta beta' alpha 2-nusA and beta beta' alpha 2-sigma are complementary forms of RNA polymerase that interchange with one another in the initiation-termination cycle of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2119807347,"During the onset of transformation, Rous sarcoma virus-infected cells undergo characteristic morphological changes that reflect the biochemical events induced by the viral src gene. Temperature down-shift experiments using chick embryo cells infected with transformation-defective temperature-sensitive viral mutants have shown two major morphological changes occurring at different times in the transformation process: ruffle-like flowers appear on the dorsal cell surface as early as 15 min after temperature shift, while later, between 6 and 12 hr, cytoskeletal stress fibers disappear and the cells round up. We report that flowers contain large accumulations of the cytoskeletal proteins actin, α-actinin, myosin and tropomyosin. Furthermore, since flowers stain very intensely with fluorescein-labeled phalloidin, a cyclopeptide that selectively binds to F-actin and not to G-actin, we suggest that these structures result from an early reorganization of microfilaments."
https://openalex.org/W1628512331,"In animal chromatin, a fraction of the histone 2A's and 2B's is covalently attached to the protein ubiquitin through an isopeptide linkage. The ubiquitin moieties of the H2A's and H2B's are found to be in rapid equilibrium with the pool of free ubiquitin, both in dividing cells such as L1210 and Chinese hamster ovary cells and in nondividing cells such as unstimulated lymphocytes. The synthesis of ubiquitin and the formation of ubiquitinated histones are not linked to DNA synthesis. All ubiquitinated histones, including the four H2A variants and the H2B's are absent from isolated metaphase chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2046175020,"We constructed and characterized recombinant cDNA clones containing α- and β-tubulin DNA sequences. The inserted DNA was determined to code for α- and β-tubulin by positive hybridization-selection. The selected mRNA was translated in vitro, and the translation products were shown to be α- or β-tubulin by comigration with flagellar α- and β-tubulin on one- and two-dimensional gels and by immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for α- and β-tubulin. Hybridization of the cloned tubulin probes with Chlamydomonas DNA indicated that there are at least two genes each for α- and β-tubulin in this organism. No evidence of cross-hybridization between α- and β-tubulin DNA sequences was found. Because previous experiments had shown that tubulin synthesis was stimulated in response to flagellar amputation, the tubulin clones were used to analyze the levels of tubulin sequences in RNA from cells before and after deflagellation. Hybridization of the tubulin cDNA probes with total or polyadenylated RNA indicated that tubulin sequences in RNA increased within 8 min following deflagellation, reached maximal levels by 50 min and began to decrease by 80 min after deflagellation. One hybridization band was detected with use of the β-tubulin probe, but RNA in two size classes hybridized to the α-tubulin probe."
https://openalex.org/W22523859,"N-Acetylglucosamine(1)phospho(6)mannose groups recently identified in lysosomal enzymes were proposed to be precursors of the recognition markers terminating with mannose 6-phosphate (Tabas, I., and Kornfeld, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 225, 6633-6639; Hasilik, A., Klein, U., Waheed, A., Strecker, G., and von Figura, K. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 7074-7078). To study the presumptive enzyme removing N-acetylglucosamine from the diester, an assay was developed using a radioactive oligosaccharide containing diester groups of the above structure. An alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase cleaving this substrate in vitro was found in human placenta and in rat liver. The enzyme was solubilized from the microsomal fraction of human placenta and more than 800-fold purified with 75% yield. It is distinct from the lysosomal alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase by the criteria of immunological cross-reactivity, substrate specificity, and heat stability. The partially purified enzyme cleaves alpha-N-acetylglucosamine phosphodiester bonds in oligosaccharides from lysosomal enzymes, in lysosomal enzymes, and in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. We propose that the microsomal alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase is involved in the processing of the phosphorylated recognition marker in lysosomal enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2046948297,"We have identified a plasmid DNA that is found within mitochondria of wild-type N. crassa strain Mauriceville-1c (FGSC #2225), but that shows no detectable sequence homology with mitochondrial DNA. The plasmid DNA consists of an oligomeric series of circular molecules of monomer length 3.6 kb. There are two unusual clusters of restriction-enzyme sites, one consisting of six Eco RI sites in a 1 kb region, and the other of five or more Pst I sites in a 0.4 kb region. RNA gel transfer hybridization experiments show a major transcript 3.3 to 3.4 kb long, close to the monomer length of the plasmid. The latter finding implies that the plasmid DNA contains specific sites for the initiation and termination of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1994033919,"Four molecular clones containing DNA homologous to the Rous sarcoma virus transforming gene (src) have been isolated from a random library of normal chicken DNA. The four clones are distinct overlapping isolates, which together span approximately 33 kb of cellular DNA. The clones locus appears to represent the major region of chicken DNA homologous to src, since src-containing restriction fragments of this locus account for the fragments detected by hybridization of src-specific probe to restriction digests of total chicken DNA. Analysis of the cloned chicken src locus by restriction and heteroduplex mapping indicates that the locus contains 1.6-1.9 kb of DNA homologous to the viral src gene. The chicken DNA sequences homologous to viral src are interrupted by five or six nonhomologous regions, totaling approximately 6 kb, which presumably represent introns in the cellular src gene."
https://openalex.org/W2145144343,"E. coli RecA protein and topoisomerase I, acting on superhelical DNA and circular single strands in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, topologically link single-stranded molecules to one another, and single-stranded molecules to duplex DNA. When superhelical DNA is relaxed by prior incubation with topoisomerase, it is a poor substrate for catenation. Extensive homology stimulates the catenation of circular single-stranded DNA and superhelical DNA, whereas little reaction occurs between these forms of the closely related DNAs of phages phi X174 and G4, indicating that, in conjunction with topoisomerase I, RecA protein can discriminate perfect or nearly perfect homology from a high degree of relatedness. Circular single-stranded G4 DNA reacts with superhelical DNA of chimeric phage, M13G ori 1, to form catenanes, at least half of which survive heating at 80 degrees C following restriction cleavage in the M13 region, but few of which survive following restriction cleavage in the G4 region. Electron microscopic examination of catenated molecules cleaved in the M13 region reveals that in most cases the single-stranded G4 DNA is joined to the linear duplex M13(G4) DNA in the homologous G4 region. The junction frequently has the appearance of a D loop, with an extent equivalent to 100 or more bp. We conclude that a significant fraction of catenanes were hemicatenanes, in which the single-stranded circle was topologically linked, probably by multiple turns, to its complementary strand in the duplex DNA. These observations support the previous conclusion that RecA protein can pair a single strand with its complementary strand in duplex DNA in a side-by-side fashion without a free end in any of the three strands."
https://openalex.org/W1500988284,"Wheat germ contains an enzyme capable of removing supercoils from circular DNA. We have purified this enzyme using Polymin P fractionation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 and phenyl-Sepharose. Renaturation after electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels shows that topoisomerase activity is associated with a polypeptide with a Mr = about 111,000. The enzyme is similar to other eukaryotic type I DNA topoisomerases (nicking-closing enzymes) by the following criteria: it is capable of increasing or decreasing the topological linking number of covalently closed DNA substrate; it is capable of restoring an equilibrium distribution of linking numbers to DNA substrate with a single unique linking number; and it does not require magnesium ion or ATP for activity."
https://openalex.org/W2118249061,"Four Drosophila alpha-tubulin genes have been isolated on recombinant DNA molecules. The identity of two of these genes (T alpha 1 and T alpha 2) was established by isolating complementary mRNAs and then examining the in vitro translation products of the mRNAs. The one- and two-dimensional gel patterns and the peptide maps of the in vitro products were indistinguishable from those of embryonic alpha-tubulin. In turn, the embryonic tubulin was identified by determining its amino-terminal sequence. We identified two other cloned alpha-tubulin genes (T alpha 3 and T alpha 4) by their complementarity to T alpha 1 and T alpha 2. Maps of restriction endonuclease sites indicate that the four genes are different. DNA hybridization studies demonstrated, however, that three of them have extensive sequence homology with each other and slight homology with the fourth, T alpha 4. Hybridization to genomic DNA fragments indicated that the four clones genes account for all of the different alpha-tubulin genes of Drosophila melanogaster. Three of them are present only once in the haploid genome; the other, T alpha 1, is present in either one or two copies. Each of the four genes hybridizes in situ to a different site on the third chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1486839213,"We studied conformational changes of purified renal sodium plus potassium ion-transport adenosine triphosphatase (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Fluorescein covalently binds to the alpha-subunit of the enzyme and inhibits the ATPase but not the p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity. Four unphosphorylated and three phosphorylated conformations were distinguished by the level of fluorescence and by the rate of its change (relative fluorescence is shown in percentages). Fluorescence of the ligand-free form (E1, 100%) was increased by Na+ (E1.Na form, 103%) and quenched by K+ (E2.K, 78%) at a site of high affinity (K0.5 for K+ = 0.07 mM). Mg2+ did not alter fluorescence of E1 or E1.Na but raised that of E2.K (E2.K.Mg form, 85-90%). Addition of excess Na+ to the E2.K.Mg form restored high fluorescence but the rate of transition from E2.K.Mg to E1.Na became progressively slower with increasing Mg2+ concentration. Two phosphorylated conformations, (E2-P).Mg (82%) and (E2-P).Mg.K (82%) were differentiated by a faster turnover of the latter form. A third conformation, (E2-P).Mg.ouabain, had the lowest fluorescence (56%) and its formation allowed the binding of ouabain to the phosphoenzyme. Reversible blocking of sulfhydryl groups with thimerosal inhibited the formation of E2.K and (E2-P).Mg.ouabain but not that of the other conformations of the fluorescein-enzyme. The thimerosal-treated fluorescein-enzyme retained K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity, inhibition of this activity by ouabain and ouabain binding. The unphosphorylated enzyme had low (K0.5 = 1.2 mM) and the phosphoenzyme had high affinity (K0.5 = 0.03 - 0.09 mM) for Mg2+ in the absence of nucleotides. Since low and high affinity for Mg2+ alternates as the enzyme turns over, Mg2+ may be bound and released sequentially during the catalytic cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1985426203,"Recovered avian sarcoma viruses (rASVs) were obtained from tumors induced by certain transformation-defective (td) mutants of Schmidt-Ruppin strain Rous sarcoma virus of subgroup A (SR-A). The genomes of these td SR-A mutants lack most but not all of the src gene. rASV genomes, however, possess intact src genes, which are largely derived from cellular genetic information, presumably an endogenous cellular gene called c-src, which shares considerable homology with the viral src. To further define the genetic origin of rASV src, we examined by tryptic peptide analysis the product of this gene, pp60src, from rASV and SR-A, as well as the normal cellular homolog pp60c-src. We found peptides unique to each putative ""parental"" protein present together in maps of rASV p60src, demonstrating that the endogenous cellular c-src gene itself contributes to the structure of rASV pp60src. Certain isolates of rASV encode pp60srcS of altered apparent molecular weight. In these cases, the variation in structure was located in the amino-terminal portion of the protein. That such polymorphism can be tolerated suggests that this region of the protein is less critical to the ability of these agents to transform cells."
https://openalex.org/W2084062918,"The Cop- plasmid pOP1 delta 6 is a recessive copy-number mutant derived from Col E1.pOP1 delta 6 exists at 200-300 copies per chromosome in E. coli, while Col E1 exists at 10-15 copies per chromosome. We have investigated the molecular basis for DNA overproduction by pOP1 delta 6 by mapping the mutation to a restriction fragment of the plasmid genome, which is about 400 bp from the origin of replication. The mutation is a single base-pair alteration-a GC leads to TA transversion. The alteration changes the nucleotide sequence of two RNA elements known to be synthesized from opposite DNA strands in the same region of the plasmid genome; a small, nontranslated RNA known as RNA1 and the primer RNA required for initiation of DNA replication in vitro. The mutation is located in a GC-rich region of dyad symmetry, which precedes the termination signal for RNA1 transcription. When pOP1 delta 6 DNA is transcribed in vitro, RNA1 is not observed. Rather, several new transcripts of a larger size are observed resulting from readthrough transcription of RNA1. In conjunction with previous genetic evidence, these results indicate that RNA 1 may be a negative modulator of Col E1 DNA replication and that its secondary structure is critical to its function."
https://openalex.org/W1481165128,"Mitochondria, submitochondrial particles, and hepatocytes prepared from the livers of rats treated chronically with ethanol (36% calories, 40 days) exhibited significant alterations in the content of specific respiratory chain components. As measured by heme absorbance, the amounts of substrate-reducible cytochromes aa3 and b were each decreased about 50%, while the amount of cytochromes c plus c1 was unchanged after chronic ethanol treatment. The amounts of extractable flavin and ubiquinone associated with the respiratory chain were also unaltered. The effects of an altered cytochrome ratio on electron transport were studied by measurements of the aerobic reduction levels of the cytochromes during steady state respiration using submitochondrial particles. The aerobic reduction patterns observed after chronic ethanol treatment reflected the differential alterations in amounts of respiratory chain components present in the membranes, as well as the intrinsic kinetic characteristics of respiratory. The most notable change was observed during ascorbate oxidation, in which case cytochrome c was maintained at a higher level of steady state reduction. The results suggest that at the level of the electron transport chain itself, the lower respiratory rates found after chronic ethanol treatment arise, at least in part, from specific alterations in the content of particular electron transfer chain carriers, but that different alterations limit the rate of respiration with different substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1501872364,"Thermodynamic parameters of succinate dehydrogenase flavin were determined potentiometrically from the analysis of free radical signal levels as a function of the oxidation-reduction potential. Midpoint redox potentials of consecutive 1-electron transfer steps are -127 and -31 mV at pH 7.0. This corresponds to a stability constant of intermediate stability, 2.5 x 10(-2), which suggests flavin itself may be a converter from n = 2 to n = 1 electron transfer steps. The pK values of the free radical (FlH . in equilibrium Fl . -) and the fully reduced form (FlH2 in equilibrium FlH-) were estimated as 8.0 +/- 0.2 and 7.7 +/- 0.2, respectively. Succinate dehydrogenase flavosemiquinone elicits an EPR spectrum at g = 2.00 with a peak to peak width of 1.2 mT even in the protonated form, suggesting the delocalization in the unpaired electron density. A close proximity of succinate dehydrogenase flavin and iron-sulfur cluster S-1 was demonstrated based on the enhancement of flavin spin relaxation by Center S-1."

https://openalex.org/W2021258890,"During the adipose differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells, there is an increase in the synthesis of numerous proteins, including the lipogenic enzymes glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, fatty acid synthetase and malic enzyme. Agents that increase cAMP content (dibutyryl cAMP, theophylline, and isoproterenol) are known to induce lipolysis in fat cells; but the same agents are shown here to reduce the synthesis of the lipogenic enzymes during adipose differentiation. The extent of reduction depends on the agent used and differs for the three enzymes; fatty acid synthetase is most sensitive and its synthesis can be suppressed completely. In contrast to their effects on lipogenic enzyme synthesis, these agents do not affect morphological changes or the synthesis of several other proteins, of which some increase and others (such as actin) decrease during the differentiation. The effects of the agents on the synthesis of lipogenic enzymes are not dependent on lipolysis, since they take place to the same degree in cells not permitted to accumulate triglyceride. Translation in vitro of mRNA isolated from cells treated with the agents promoting cAMP accumulation indicates that the levels of functional mRNA for lipogenic enzymes are reduced. We conclude that, in addition to its activation of lipolysis, cAMP reduces specifically mRNA accumulation for lipogenic enzymes. These results also demonstrate the independent control of morphological change and enzyme synthesis during adipose differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1599727599,"Abstract E-5-(2-Iodovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (IvdUrd), a highly selective and potent anti-herpes agent, is phosphorylated by primary rabbit kidney (PRK) cells that have been infected with either herpes simplex virus type 1 (KOS) or herpes simplex virus type 2 (G). However, IvdUrd is not phosphorylated by mock-infected PRK cells or PRK cells that have been infected with a thymidine kinase-deficient mutant of herpes simplex virus type 1 (B 2006). These observations strengthen the concept that the selectivity of IvdUrd and related E-5-(2-halogenovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridines as anti-herpes agents depends on a specific phosphorylation by the virus-encoded thymidine kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1600348337,"The carbohydrate structures of two membrane glycoproteins (HANA protein and F protein) of HVJ have been determined on materials purified from virions grown in the allantoic sac of embryonated chicken eggs. Both glycoproteins contain fucose, mannose, galactose, and glucosamine but not galactosamine, indicating that their sugar chains are exclusively of the asparagine-linked type. The radioactive oligosaccharide fractions obtained from the two glycoproteins by hydrazinolysis followed by NaB[3H]4 reduction gave quite distinct fractionation patterns after paper electrophoresis. More than 75% of the oligosaccharides from F protein were acidic and separated into at least four components by paper electrophoresis. Only 18% of the oligosaccharide from HANA protein was an acidic single component. These acidic oligosaccharides could not be converted to neutral oligosaccharides by sialidase digestion. Structural studies of the neutral oligosaccharide fractions from HANA and F proteins revealed that both of them are mixtures of a series of high mannose type oligosaccharides and of complex type oligosaccharides with Gal beta 1 leads to (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3) GlcNAc group in their outer chain moieties."

https://openalex.org/W1493316405,"Abstract Ram sperm adenylate cyclase is insensitive to fluoride, guanine nucleotides, cholera toxin, and hormones, and appears devoid of the guanine nucleotide regulatory component. In this paper, we demonstrate that human erythrocyte membranes are capable of restoring guanine nucleotide regulation and fluoride sensitivity to ram sperm adenylate cyclase. The reconstitution process in the presence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate or NaF is time-dependent, directly proportional to the quantity of erythrocyte protein added to the reconstitution system, and is only observed when Mg-ATP is used as substrate. Furthermore, the guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate-reconstituted activity can be activated by prostaglandin E1 or prostaglandin E2 through the binding sites normally present in human erythrocyte membranes. It therefore appears that reconstitution of the adenylate cyclase system can be readily performed in normal membranes which are deficient in regulatory component, and not only using defective cultured cell lines."

Target size analysis of the data revealed that increasing doses of ionizing radiation from 1-48 megarads resulted in a monoexponential decay in binding activity due to a decrease in the number of available binding sites; dissociation and binding affinity were unaffected. The molecular weight of the rat binding protein, determined in situ by target analysis, was 104,000 +/- 17,000; that of the rabbit binding protein was 109,000 +/- 5,000. Comparison of the value obtained by irradiation of the intact rat plasma membrane with that of the purified receptor revealed the latter to have an apparent molecular weight of 148,000 +/- 16,000. Evidence is presented to indicate that the observed increase in target size was a response to the presence of Triton X-100 used in the solubilization and assay procedure. In contrast to the size of the ligand binding functional unit, the antireceptor antibody binding site was estimated to be 30,000 +/- 2,000."
https://openalex.org/W1556536136,Apoprotein suitable for heme reconstitution has been prepared by an acid/butanone extraction of cytochrome P-450cam at pH 2.5. Absorption spectra of apo-P-450cam indicate less than 2% residual holoenzyme. Four tryptophan residues per molecule were estimated from the aromatic absorbance region of denatured apoprotein. Heme-reconstituted holoprotein was purified in 30% yield to a specific activity equivalent to the native enzyme. Absorption and EPR spectra of 57Fe- and 54Fe-heme-enriched P-450cam reveal complete restoration of the native active site.
https://openalex.org/W1977923048,"The inheritance of chloroplast genes in Chlamydomonas is regulated by methylation of chloroplast DNA during gametogenesis. The wild-type pattern of maternal inheritance results from the methylation of chloroplast DNA in female (mt+) but not in male (mt-) gametes, leading to preferential degradation of chloroplast DNA of male origin in zygotes. This paper describes the distribution of 5-methyl cytosine residues in restriction fragments of chloroplast DNA sampled during gametogenesis by two methods: ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels, and binding of antibody directed against 5-methyl cytosine onto restriction fragments blotted to nitro-cellulose paper. Methylated cytosines are located in most if not all Eco RI and Msp I fragments, but the extent of methylation is not proportional to fragment size. The mat-1 mutation carried by males converts maternal inheritance. Chloroplast DNA of male gametes carrying the mat-1 mutation becomes methylated during gametogenesis. This methylation protects against restriction enzyme-promoted degradation in zygotes, as shown by physical data demonstrating the transmission to progeny of chloroplast genes carried on chloroplast DNA of the mat-1 male parent. Thus the mat-1 gene, which is linked to the mating-type locus, determines whether or not methylation of chloroplast DNA will occur in males during gametogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2416568071,"The pH dependence in the range 3--7 of the optical absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance of the nitric oxide adduct of ferrous Aplysia myoglobin is reported. Optical spectra in the Soret region show a transition between two conformers with an apparent pK in the range 3.5--5 depending on the presence of carboxylic anions as third component. In the same pH range, the EPR spectrum undergoes a change from a 9-line to a 3-line hyperfine pattern in the g. region, similar to that reported for synthetic heme derivatives and for other hemoproteins. The structural interpretation of the pH-induced transition experienced by Aplysia myoglobin nitric oxide is that of a proton-linked cleavage of the proximal bond as suggested by several lines of evidence. Temperature-jump measurements allowed an estimation of the relaxation time for the process, which is of the order of 0.3 ms at 25 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1502131488,"Abstract Cell fusion-inducing (fusogenic) proteoliposomes of defined chemical composition were reconstituted from purified glycoproteins of hemagglutinating virus of Japan (Sendai virus) either with lipids extracted from the virus particles or with a chemically defined lipid mixture. Cell fusion reactions induced by the reconstituted system have several important characteristics similar to the virus-induced fusion reaction: fusogenic activity of the proteoliposomes depends on the presence of active fusion protein in the vesicles and, in the case of Ehrlich tumor cells, the fusion is almost completely inhibited by adding cytochalasin D to a final concentration of 4 microgram/ml. The only known difference between the original and reconstituted systems is that a greater amount of the latter is necessary for the same degree of fusogenic activity. Thus, the reconstituted system can be used as a model for the Sendai virus-induced fusion reaction. A lipid mixture (phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine:sphingomyelin = 1:2:1:1, by weight, and cholesterol equimolar to the total phospholipids) similar to that of the virion was active for reconstitution, whereas a mixture containing the same composition of phospholipids but no cholesterol, and ones containing cholesterol with only a single species of phospholipid were not reconstitutively active."
https://openalex.org/W1606180650,"Abstract The amino acid sequence around the site of the regulatory subunit of type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (RI) that is phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase has been determined. This site was found to be located near the site on RI previously shown to be very sensitive to hydrolysis by trypsin (Potter, R. L., and Taylor, S. S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2413-2418). The primary sequence surrounding the site is as follows: -Lys-Ala-Gly-Ser-Arg-Ala-Asp-Ser-Arg-Glu-Asp-Glu-Ile-Ser-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Asn-Pro-Val-Val-Lys-Gly-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ser(P)-Ala-Glu-Val-Tyr-Thr-Glu-Glu-Asp-Ala-Ala-Ser-Tyr-Val-Arg-Lys-Val-Ile-Pro-Lys-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Thr-. As described previously (Geahlen, R. L., and Krebs, E. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1164-1169), this site is specific for cGMP-dependent protein kinase and is not phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1484389951,"Horse heart cytochrome c was progressively maleylated, and fractions containing increasing numbers of modified lysines were obtained. The 695 nm band was present in derivatives containing up to 14 maleylated residues. Circular dichroic spectra showed minor changes beginning with 8 substituted lysines; in derivatives with 14 or more maleylated lysines, circular dichroism indicated total disruption of the native conformation. The ionic strength dependence of the measured oxidation reduction potentials and second order rate constants of reduction with ascorbate varied as expected from application of Debye-Huckel theory to the differently charged derivatives. The thermodynamic oxidation-reduction potentials decreased with the increase in the number of negatively charged groups, in a manner similar to that observed for simple iron complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1573493863,"The catalytic properties of purified RNase D were examined. The enzyme requires a divalent cation for activity, and this requirement can be satisfied by Mg2+, MN2+, or Co2+. RNase D is most active at pH 9.1-9.5, but this optimum may reflect an effect on the substrate as well as the enzyme. A variety of RNAs were tested as substrates for RNase D. Alteration of the 3'-terminal base has no effect on the rate of hydrolysis, whereas modification of the 3'-terminal sugar has a major effect. tRNA terminating with a 3'-phosphate is completely inactive as a substrate. The rate of hydrolysis of intact tRNA is very slow compared to tRNAs containing extra residues or compared to tRNAs from which part of the -C-C-A sequence has been removed. Oxidation of the terminal sugar, reduction of the dialdehyde with borohydride, or removal of the terminal AMP from intact tRNa increase the activity of the substrate. Addition of a second -C-C-A sequence gives an active substrate indicating that the relative resistance of intact tRNA to RNase D hydrolysis is not due to the sequence per se but to the structural environment of the 3'-terminus. Studies of the mode of action of RNase D indicate that it is an exonuclease which initiates hydrolysis at the 3'-terminus and removes 5'-mononucleotides in a random fashion. The requirements of RNase D for interaction with nucleic acids and for hydrolysis of various RNAs and the relation of these properties to its possible role as a processing nuclease is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1533829772,"The capacity of rat liver mitochondria to transport and metabolize B6 compounds has been studied. In B6-sufficient rats, 20% of the B6 content in liver is located in mitochondria. The ratio of pyridoxal-P to pyridoxamine-P in isolated mitochondria is increased with 2-oxoglutarate as substrate and decreased with glutamate. Isolated mitochondria contain pyridoxal-P(pyridoxamine-P) hydrolase activity in the intermembranous space. They exhibit no pyridoxal kinase activity and less than 5% of the pyridoxamine-P(pyridoxine-P) oxidase activity in cytosol and cannot synthesize pyridoxal-P or pyridoxamine-P from pyridoxine, pyridoxal, or pyridoxine-P. When isolated hepatocytes are incubated with [14C]pyridoxine, [14C]pyridoxal-P synthesized in the cytosol is taken up by mitochondria at a rate approximating linearity. Additionally, as reflected by the lower specific radioactivity of [14C]pyridoxal-P in mitochondria than that in cytosol, the extent of mixing of newly synthesized and endogenous pools of pyridoxal-P in these subcellular compartments is heterogeneous. When cytosol from hepatocytes incubated with [14C]pyridoxine is dialyzed to equilibrium, a dialyzable pool of [14C]pyridoxal-P with specific radioactivity similar to that of the added [14C]pyridoxine is identified. It appears that pyridoxal-P from this newly synthesized pool is preferentially transported into mitochondria or secreted and degraded by hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1542018529,"RNase D, a putative tRNa processing nuclease, has been purified about 1,000-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli to apparent homogeneity, as judged by acrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing and denaturing conditions and by gel electrofocusing. The purified enzyme is a single chain protein with a molecular weight of 40,000 and an isoelectric point of about 6.2. Spectral analysis indicated that RNase D is devoid of nucleic acid. Amino acid analysis suggested a low content of cysteine, and this was confirmed by the relative insensitivity of the enzyme to sulfhydryl group reagents. RNase D is sensitive to inactivation by elevated temperatures but can be protected by a variety of RNAs, including those which are not substrates for hydrolysis. The relation of RNase D to other known E. coli ribonucleases and to other previously identified processing activities, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1556808651,"The total synthesis of the suppressor tRNA gene (ssu1) containing a 51-base pair long natural promoter has previously been reported. In this paper, we describe the synthesis and characterization of two genes (ssu3 and ssu4) in which the promoter sequence present in the parent ssu1 gene has been altered. The modifications, introduced as a part of the study of structure-function relationships, were placed in the two known prominent regions of homology. The change introduced in ssu3 was a G:C to A:T transition at -10 nucleotide, while the two changes incorporated in ssu4 involved a G:C to A:T transition at -36 nucleotide and a G:C to T:A transversion at -38 nucleotide. The promoters containing the modifications were constructed by T4-polynucleotide ligase joining of the appropriate chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. These promoters then replaced the promoter region of the cloned and previously synthesized ssu2 gene by utilization of the HindIII site present at the junction of the promoter and the structural gene. The genes containing the modified promoters have been cloned into the plasmid vector pBR322 by insertion into the unique Eco RI site. The DNA sequencing of the cloned genes now described as well as that of the previously cloned and chemically synthesized genes (ssu1 and ssu2) provide direct confirmation of the accuracy of the synthetic work (chemical and enzymatic) at all stages."
https://openalex.org/W1574235558,"The stereochemical course of the phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by T4 polynucleotide kinase has been determined using the chiral ATP analog, (Sp)-adenosine-5'-(3-thio-3-[18O]triphosphate). T4 polynucleotide kinase catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-thiophosphoryl group of (Sp)-adenosine-5'-(3-thio-3-[18O]triphosphate) to the 5'-hydroxyl group of ApA to give the thiophosphorylated dinucleotide adenyl-5'-[18O]phosphorothioate-(3'-5')adenosine. A sample of adenyl-5'-[18O]phosphorothioate-(3'-5')adenosine was subjected to venom phosphodiesterase digestion. The resulting adenosine-5'-[18O]phosphorothioate was shown to have the Rp configuration, thus indicating that the thiophosphoryl transfer reaction occurs with overall inversion of configuration of phosphorus."
https://openalex.org/W18322360,"We have developed a novel method for studying the ability to wheat germ RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription in vitro on unnicked duplex DNA template. Our template is a plasmid which has been relaxed in vitro with wheat germ DNA topoisomerase I. The plasmid consists of SV40 cloned in pBR322. We transcribe briefly to synthesize highly labeled nascent RNA, then fractionate the resulting ternary complexes on an agarose gel to separate relaxed, closed circular DNA from other DNA species contaminating the template preparation. Under optimal conditions, we recover about half of the total RNA synthesized in complex with relaxed, closed circular DNA. The remaining RNA is in association with other DNA species or is free in solution. The principal conclusions we draw from these studies are: 1) relaxed, closed circular DNA can serve as a template for in vitro transcription, although the relative efficiencies of transcription are such that even a few per cent contamination with nicked or supercoiled template can cause transcription from these forms to dominate the reaction. 2) Initiation occurs on approximately 1 in 25 cloned circular molecules in the course of a 5-min reaction, under optimal conditions. This transcription is not predominantly from SV40 in vivo promoters and is either random or from a sufficient number of sites as to appear random. 3) There is a striking dependence of initiation frequency on purine nucleoside triphosphate concentration, especially with GTP."
https://openalex.org/W1572891279,"A 3.7 S binding protein for the steroid hormone and vitamin D metabolite 1 alpha-25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2-D) was observed in high salt cytosol extracts of chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane. The binding protein was characterized after partial purification of cytosol extracts by ammonium sulfate fractionation. The binding of 1,25-(OH)2-D was saturable, had a high affinity (Kd = 0.16 nM), and was specific for hormonally active vitamin D metabolites. Analysis of the displacement of [3H]1,25-(OH)2-D by unlabeled analogues showed the affinities of vitamin D metabolites to be in the order of 1,25-(OH)2-D = 1,24R,25-(OH)3-D much greater than 25-OH-D = 1-OH-D greater than 24R,25-(OH)2-D. Hormone binding was sensitive to pretreatment with sulfhydryl-blocking reagents. The chorioallantoic membrane 1,25-(OH)2-D-binding protein associated with the chromatin fraction after homogenization of membranes in low salt buffer, and bound to DNA-cellulose columns, eluting as a single peak at 0.215 M KCl. These findings support identification of this 1,25-(OH)2-D-binding protein as a steroid hormone receptor, with properties indistinguishable from 1,25-(OH)2-D receptors in other chick tissues. The chorioallantoic membrane functions in the last third of embryonic development to reabsorb calcium from the eff shell for deposition in embryonic bone. 1,25-(OH)2-D binding activity in the chorioallantoic membrane increased 4- to 5-fold from day 12 to day 16 of incubation, immediately preceding the onset of shell reabsorption. This finding suggests that 1,25-(OH)2-D may act to regulate shell mobilization and transepithelial calcium transport by the chorioallantoic membrane. Finally, the similarity of shell mobilization to bone resorption, which is also stimulated by 1,25-(OH)2-D, suggests that the chorioallantoic membrane is a useful alternate model for the study of 1,25-(OH)2-D action on bone mineral metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1594539770,"The activity of mevalonate kinase and of mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase in human skin fibroblasts grown in culture was increased when whole fetal calf serum in the incubation medium was replaced with lipid-deficient serum. The drug demecolcine interfered with low density lipoprotein binding by cells and increased sterol synthesis and activities of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and mevalonate kinase. In contrast to normal cells, fibroblasts from a patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia did not show any lower mevalonate kinase activity following incubation with whole serum compared with that in cells incubated with lipid-deficient serum. Insulin increased the activity of mevalonate kinase in fibroblasts. Livers of rats fed for 7 days with a diet containing 1% cholesterol showed reduced activity of mevalonate kinase and mevalonate phosphate kinase. These results are consistent with the possibility that enzymatic reactions other than those catalyzed by hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase may play a role in the physiological regulation of sterol synthesis in mammalian tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1592576173,"Suspensions derived from attached HeLa cells transported 45Ca2+ considerably faster than those derived from spinner cultures grown in liquid medium. Incubation of spinner cells with fibronectin or cold-insoluble globulin in the presence of 5% calf serum at 37 degrees C for 1 to 2 h greatly increased the rate of Ca2+ flux into the cells. Suspensions of cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus transported Ca2+ much more slowly than cell suspensions of the parent strain of normal rat kidney. Incubation of the transformed cells or Ehrlich ascites tumor cells with fibronectin increased the rate of Ca2+ uptake, while no effect was seen on Ca2+ transport by this treatment of normal kidney cells grown in tissue cultures. A 45,500-dalton protein was found to interact firmly with Ca2+ that entered into attached HeLa cells or fibronectin-treated spinner cells. This Ca2+-associated protein was detected by lithium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis at 0 degrees C after 30 s of exposure to radioactive Ca2+. In tumor cells without fibronectin treatment, the radioactive band was not seen under the same conditions, even after 10 min incubation with 45Ca2+. In fibronectin-treated tumor cells, addition of Ca2+ to buffered solutions resulted in increased phosphorylation of a protein in the 45,000-dalton region. The phosphorylated protein band which appears to be associated with the cytoskeleton can be resolved by isoelectric focusing into four polypeptide chains. The relation of these observations to the cascade of protein kinases involved in the phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the (Na+-K+)-ATPase is discussed."
