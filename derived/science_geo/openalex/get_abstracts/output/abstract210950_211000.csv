https://openalex.org/W1988528511,"Injection of rats aged 3 to 9 days with hydrocortisone causes precocious development of invertase activity in the small intestine. The enzyme becomes fully active about 72 hours after injection of hydrocortisone. Invertase activity is also detectable when hydrocortisone is added to organ culture of intestine derived from 5-to 6-day old rats. Hydrocortisone does not appear to affect the activity of lactase, suggesting that it does not act solely by hastening the normal maturation process."

https://openalex.org/W2091317904,"Three electrophoretic patterns of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase have been found in wild-type strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Genetical control of the variants in enzyme mobility (fast or slow) is X-linked; strains possessing both bands (fast and slow) appear to be heterogeneous, having individuals of three types (fast, slow, and double)."
https://openalex.org/W2077954618,Electron micrographs of purified replicating form DNA of the bacteriophage Ã¸X-174 show that it has ring structure. The circular property may explain both the abnormally high sedimentation coefficient and the great resistance of this DNA to irreversible heat denaturation. Intactness of the circle is required for the control of strand selection during transcription into complementary copies of RNA.
https://openalex.org/W2069800792,"Undifferentiated malignant tumors were induced at the site of injection of human adenovirus type 12 into newborn mice of the C(3)H(f)/ G(8). strain, but not of the DBA(f), or A(f) strains. The tumors were grossly and histologically similar to those induced by this virus in hamsters, but appeared in a smaller percentage of injected mice than hamsters."

https://openalex.org/W2023367675,A new spore phenomenon is described in which induction of increased heat resistance occurs during the process of heating. In buffered environments the acid form of dormant mature bacterial spores shows a temperature dependent adaptation to heat which is correlated with the rate of uptake of Ca(OH)2 by titration at constant pH in neutral salt solution.
https://openalex.org/W2055352932,"The cytochrome composition of mitochondrial fractions which have been stripped of inner membrane subunits by exposure to high-frequency sound have been examined by low-temperature spectroscopy. The ratio of cytochrome c to cytochrome a is not changed by the treatment, but the concentration of cytochrome per milligram of protein is increased and the concentrations of cytochromes c1 and b change slightly. These cytochromes (c1 and b) may be at least partly located in the subunits of the inner membrane, but the idea that all the respiratory components are located in single subunits of the mitochondrial cristae may be considered to be disproved."
https://openalex.org/W2006189545,"Antiserums to macroglobulins were prepared by a convenient and time-saving procedure in which acrylamide gel was used as adjuvant. After electrophoresis in acrylamide gel, the macroglobulin zone from the gel pattern was homogenized and injected directly into rabbits without intermediate isolation of the purified antigen. The resulting antiserums exhibited high titers of antiserum to macroglobulin and showed only weak cross-reactions with other gamma globulins in serologic tests."
https://openalex.org/W2055484530,"With the retinal image of a 35-minute circular target stabilized against horizontal eye movements, horizontal autokinesis is markedly reduced. It is suggested that this result is consistent with an eye movement interpretation of autokinetic movement, and further, that the response patterns reported here are similar to those that might be expected from recent work describing cortical single unit movement detectors."
https://openalex.org/W2022271367,"Human plasma contains hydroxyproline in a bound form that is nondialyzable, is precipitable with the usual protein precipitants, can be extracted with hot trichloroacetic acid, and is released on hydrolysis in 6N HCI. These properties resemble those of collagen and suggest that small amounts of this connective tissue protein (3 to 5 mg per 100 ml), or a very large peptide derived from it, normally circulate in the blood. The identification and analysis of hydroxyproline in hydrolyzates of plasma protein were based on isotope-dilution procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1993533590,"Cutaneous mechanoreceptors have been anatomically delineated, and the physiological characteristics of the nerve fibers and receptor terminals have been studied. Frequency analysis of spike trains showed two rate processes associated with the rising and plateau phases of the mechanical stimulus. Natural stimulation is capable of evoking firing frequencies which saturate the carrying capacities of the fiber."
https://openalex.org/W2073213859,"White-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, possess several characteristics which make them interesting subjects for the experimental study of social interactions and stress physiology: tolerance of very high cage densities among social congeners; marked behavioral intolerance among social strangers; exceptionally large adrenal glands; and adrenal and eosinophil responses sensitive to social disturbance."

https://openalex.org/W2059218284,"Ethacrynic acid, injected intravenously after surgical removal of one kidney of anesthetized dogs, lowered the concentration of protein-bound sulfhydryl groups in cells of the remaining kidney. Chloride excretion and urinary output of the kidney exposed to the drug increased. These findings indicate that the diuresis produced by ethacrynic acid may be related to its capacity for binding sulfhydryl groups of renal cellular proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1987701356,"Female C57B1/6J mice given one intraperitoneal injection of 1 to 8 million isologous epididymal sperm cells may exhibit either delayed or accelerated rejection of isologous male skin, depending on both the number of sperm cells injected and the time of application of the graft. A long time interval or a large dose of sperm cells results in maintenance of the male graft or delayed rejection, while a small dose and short time interval produces an accelerated rejection phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1991874994,"Four groups of rats were trained to make a simple spatial discrimination. Two of the groups had previously been trained to make the reverse discriminations, the other two had no prior training. Two groups were tested I day after training, while two others were tested 44 days after training. There was no retention loss unless prior interference had been provided."
https://openalex.org/W2005168160,"In Drosophila melanogaster, mutants at two loci are known to lack detectable amounts of xanthine dehydrogenase activity. These are the maroon-like eye-color locus on the X chromosome and the rosy-eye-color locus on the third chromosome (52+/-). A survey was made of the xanthine dehydrogenase content of 98 wild-type strains of D. melanogaster. One strain with 25 percent of the xanthine dehydrogenase activity found in normal flies is described. Strains with high xanthine dehydrogenase activity have also been obtained by selection."

J.)1; mucoproteins were also found in the sweat of the horse, the chief protein of which is albumin (the sweat glands in the horse are of an apocrine type)2,3. We have now examined the immunochemical behaviour of proteins in human sweat, according to their specific antigenic properties."

https://openalex.org/W2045299542,"Contractions induced by adenosine triphosphate, in myofibrils isolated from the barnacle, Balanus aquilia, were observed with a phase microscope. The formation of contraction bands was well under way before the A-band came into contact with the Z-membrane. This is in disagreement with the hypothesis that contraction bands are formed when the A-band pushes against the Z-membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1994713572,"Escherichia coli, strain 15T-L-, inactivation by H3-thymidine decay was used in a study of DNA segregation. Two characteristics of the inactivation curves due to H3-thymidine decay, the initial slope and stable fraction, enable the mode of segregation to be defined. The results suggest that the segregation pattern is consistent with a semiconservative model of DNA replication. The data on the stable fraction indicate that the DNA of strain 15T-L-, under our experimental conditions, may be organized into one duplex structure. Since colony-forming ability was used as the means of assay, it is possible to compare these experiments with those in which DNA segregation is examined on a structural basis."

It was presumed that the relaxation and the subsequent contraction produced by DNP were duo to depletion of stores of adenosine triphosphate. In the present research ATP, ADP and AMP have actually been estimated under the foregoing conditions."
