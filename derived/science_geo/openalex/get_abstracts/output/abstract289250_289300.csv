https://openalex.org/W1989491789,"An x-ray diffraction study of iron under pressure has shown that alpha-iron (body-centered cubic) transforms to hexagonal-close-packing (designated epsilon-iron) at 130 kb, room temperature. The volume change for the transformation is -0.20 +/- 0.03 cm2/ mole. The slope for the gamma-epsilon phase boundary has been calculated to be 2 +/- 1 degrees C/kb. The molar volume of iron decreases from 7.10 cm3/mole (density = 7.85 g/cm(3)) at room pressure to 6.10 +/- 0.08 cm(3)/mole (density = 9.1 +/- 0.1 g/cm(3)) at 200 kb and room temperature. The extrapolation of the gamma-epsilon phase boundary, consistent with shock wave data, suggests that it may have an influence on the properties of the earth's core."

https://openalex.org/W1974226884,"Magnesium silicide (Mg3Si) undergoes a transformation from a cubic (fluorite) type lattice to a hexagonal lattice at pressures above about 25 kilobars and temperatures above 900 degrees C. There is an increase of density of about 15 percent associated with this structure change. Both the parent and product substances are semiconductors, but of different resistivities. The high pressure phase may be recovered and is indefinitely metastable at normal ambient conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1988021478,"X-ray diffraction studies conducted at high pressure with a beryllium pressure vessel show that compression parallel to the c-axis of CaCO(3)-I (calcite), as the phase boundary of CaCO-(3)II (modified calcite type) is approached, results in a relative reduction of the c-axis of phase II of several times that of the a-axes. Such data are not consistent with previously proposed anion disorder in CaCO(3)-II. At 18.7 +/- .5 kb and room temperature a new phase of CaCO3 has been observed that is assumed to be phase III found by Bridgman. At this pressure the x-ray diffraction pattern can be indexed as orthorhombic KNO3-IV type, with a0 = 8.90 +/- .01 A, b0 = 8.42 +/- .01 A, and c0 = 7.14 +/- .01 A (Z = 10)."
https://openalex.org/W2135304847,"It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to join my colleagues John Bardeen and Leon Cooper in discussing with you the theory of superconductivity. Since the discovery of superconductivity by H. Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, an enormous effort has been devoted by a spectrum of outstanding scientists to understanding this phenomenon. As in most developments in our branch of science, the accomplishments honored by this Nobel prize were made possible by a large number of developments preceding them. A general understanding of these developments is important as a backdrop for our own contribution."
https://openalex.org/W1986293223,"The mechanism for the enhancement of amitrole activity on quackgrass (Agropyron repens) by the addition of ammonium thiocyanate was studied. Absorption and translocation of C(14)-amitrole after applications to foliage were determined by a direct count of the radioactivity in the wash solution and plant extracts. Regardless of the time of application, the addition of ammonium thiocyanate did not alter the amount of C(14)-amitrole absorbed. Ammonium thiocyanate (5000 parts per million) greatly increased the amount of carbon-14 translocated. This increase may account for the greater herbicidal effectiveness of the mixture of amitrole and ammonium thiocyanate."

The discovery suggests that early Precambrian rocks covered an extensive area in northcentral United States and were not restricted to several small nuclei."

https://openalex.org/W4213269050,"In the report ""Neutron and proton dosages in the upper atmosphere from solar flare radiation"" by E. J. Flamm and R. E. Lingenfelter (26 June, p. 1566), the factor 1/Î¼ should be eliminated from Eqs. 2, 3a, and 3b. This correction reduces the calculated neutron and proton doses by approximately 50 percent but does not otherwise alter the conclusions drawn from the calculation. The authors thank Dr. I. M. Karp for pointing out this error."
