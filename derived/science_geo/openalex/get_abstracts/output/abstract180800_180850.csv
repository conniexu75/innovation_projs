https://openalex.org/W1994500027,"The Yap1 transcription factor regulates hydroperoxide homeostasis in S. cerevisiae. Yap1 is activated by oxidation when hydroperoxide levels increase. We show that Yap1 is not directly oxidized by hydroperoxide. We identified the glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-like enzyme Gpx3 as a second component of the pathway, serving the role of sensor and transducer of the hydroperoxide signal to Yap1. When oxidized by H2O2, Gpx3 Cys36 bridges Yap1 Cys598 by a disulfide bond. This intermolecular disulfide bond is then resolved into a Yap1 intramolecular disulfide bond, the activated form of the regulator. Thioredoxin turns off the pathway by reducing both sensor and regulator. These data reveal a redox-signaling function for a GPx-like enzyme and elucidate a eukaryotic hydroperoxide-sensing mechanism. Gpx3 is thus a hydroperoxide receptor and redox-transducer."
https://openalex.org/W2013621644,"Adult bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) are shown to contribute to muscle tissue in a step-wise biological progression. Following irradiation-induced damage, transplanted GFP-labeled BMDC become satellite cells: membrane-ensheathed mononucleate muscle stem cells. Following a subsequent exercise-induced damage, GFP-labeled multinucleate myofibers are detected. Isolated GFP-labeled satellite cells are heritably myogenic. They express three characteristic muscle markers, are karyotypically diploid, and form clones that can fuse into multinucleate cells in culture or into myofibers after injection into mouse muscles. These results suggest that two temporally distinct injury-related signals first induce BMDC to occupy the muscle stem cell niche and then to help regenerate mature muscle fibers. The stress-induced progression of BMDC to muscle satellite cell to muscle fiber results in a contribution to as many as 3.5% of muscle fibers and is due to developmental plasticity in response to environmental cues."
https://openalex.org/W2074489888,"Excitatory and inhibitory inputs converge on single neurons and are integrated into a coherent output. Although much is known about short-term integration, little is known about how neurons sum opposing signals for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory storage. In Aplysia, we find that when a sensory neuron simultaneously receives inputs from the facilitatory transmitter 5-HT at one set of synapses and the inhibitory transmitter FMRFamide at another, long-term facilitation is blocked and synapse-specific long-term depression dominates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that 5-HT induces the downstream gene C/EBP by activating CREB1, which recruits CBP for histone acetylation, whereas FMRFa leads to CREB1 displacement by CREB2 and recruitment of HDAC5 to deacetylate histones. When the two transmitters are applied together, facilitation is blocked because CREB2 and HDAC5 displace CREB1-CBP, thereby deacetylating histones."
https://openalex.org/W2072320843,"Perlecan, a ubiquitous basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, plays key roles in blood vessel growth and structural integrity. We discovered that the C terminus of perlecan potently inhibited four aspects of angiogenesis: endothelial cell migration, collagen-induced endothelial tube morphogenesis, and blood vessel growth in the chorioallantoic membrane and in Matrigel plug assays. The C terminus of perlecan was active at nanomolar concentrations and blocked endothelial cell adhesion to fibronectin and type I collagen, without directly binding to either protein; henceforth we have named it ""endorepellin."" We also found that endothelial cells possess a significant number of high affinity (<i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> of 11 nm) binding sites for endorepellin and that endorepellin binds endostatin and counteracts its anti-angiogenic effects. Thus, endorepellin represents a novel anti-angiogenic product, which may retard tumor neovascularization and hence tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2161116308,"Recently, we presented evidence for conventional, strand-coupled replication of mammalian mitochondrial DNA. Partially single-stranded replication intermediates detected in the same DNA preparations were assumed to derive from the previously described, strand-asymmetric mode of mitochondrial DNA replication. Here, we show that bona fide replication intermediates from highly purified mitochondria are essentially duplex throughout their length, but contain widespread regions of RNA:DNA hybrid, as a result of the incorporation of ribonucleotides on the light strand which are subsequently converted to DNA. Ribonucleotide-rich regions can be degraded to generate partially single-stranded molecules by RNase H treatment in vitro or during DNA extraction from crude mitochondria. Mammalian mitochondrial DNA replication thus proceeds mainly, or exclusively, by a strand-coupled mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2039418057,"CNF1 toxin is a virulence factor produced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Upon cell binding and introduction into the cytosol, CNF1 deamidates glutamine 63 of RhoA (or 61 of Rac and Cdc42), rendering constitutively active these GTPases. Unexpectedly, we measured in bladder cells a transient CNF1-induced activation of Rho GTPases, maximal for Rac. Deactivation of Rac correlated with the increased susceptibility of its deamidated form to ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation. Sensitivity to ubiquitylation could be generalized to other permanent-activated forms of Rac and to its sustained activation by Dbl. Degradation of the toxin-activated Rac allowed both host cell motility and efficient cell invasion by uropathogenic bacteria. CNF1 toxicity thus results from a restricted activation of Rho GTPases through hijacking the host cell proteasomal machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2013504014,"Mitochondrial proteins with N-terminal targeting signals are transported across the inner membrane via the presequence translocase, which consists of membrane-integrated channel proteins and the matrix Hsp70 import motor. It has not been known how preproteins are directed to the import channel. We have identified the essential protein Tim50, which exposes its major domain to the intermembrane space. Tim50 interacts with preproteins in transit and directs them to the channel protein Tim23. Inactivation of Tim50 strongly inhibits the import of preproteins with a classical matrix-targeting signal, while preproteins carrying an additional inner membrane-sorting signal do not strictly depend on Tim50. Thus, Tim50 is crucial for guiding the precursors of matrix proteins to their insertion site in the inner membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2159403505,"Based on the results of site-specific photocrosslinking of translocation intermediates, we have identified Tim50, a component of the yeast TIM23 import machinery, which mediates translocation of presequence-containing proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Tim50 is anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane, exposing the C-terminal domain to the intermembrane space. Tim50 interacts with the N-terminal intermembrane space domain of Tim23. Functional defects of Tim50 either by depletion of the protein or addition of anti-Tim50 antibodies block the protein translocation across the inner membrane. A translocation intermediate accumulated at the TOM complex is crosslinked to Tim50. We suggest that Tim50, in cooperation with Tim23, facilitates transfer of the translocating protein from the TOM complex to the TIM23 complex"
https://openalex.org/W2122746216,"Periplasmic chaperones direct the assembly of adhesive, multi-subunit pilus fibers that play critical roles in bacterial pathogenesis. Pilus assembly occurs via a donor strand exchange mechanism in which the N-terminal extension of one subunit replaces the chaperone G(1) strand that transiently occupies a groove in the neighboring subunit. Here, we show that the chaperone primes the subunit for assembly by holding the groove in an open, activated conformation. During donor strand exchange, the subunit undergoes a topological transition that triggers the closure of the groove and seals the N-terminal extension in place. It is this topological transition, made possible only by the priming action of the chaperone that drives subunit assembly into the fiber."
https://openalex.org/W1518401857,"Proteins with dibasic retention motifs are subject to retrograde transport to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by COPI-coated vesicles. As forward transport requires escape from ER retention, general release mechanisms have been expected. Here, KCNK3 potassium channels are shown to bear two cytoplasmic trafficking motifs: an N-terminal dibasic site that binds beta-COP to hold channels in ER and a C-terminal ""release"" site that binds the ubiquitous intracellular regulator 14-3-3beta on a nonclassical motif in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion to suppress beta-COP binding and allow forward transport. The strategy appears to be common. The major histocompatibility antigen class II-associated invariant chain Iip35 exhibits dibasic retention, carries a release motif, and shows mutually exclusive binding of beta-COP and 14-3-3beta on adjacent N-terminal sites. Other retained proteins are demonstrated to carry functional 14-3-3beta release motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2123082386,"Ferritin is a ubiquitous intracellular iron storage protein that consists of 24 subunits of the H and L type. The ability to sequester iron from participation in oxygen free radical formation is consistent with a cytoprotective role for ferritin. Here we demonstrate that ferritins H and L are induced in cells treated with β-napthoflavone (β-NF) and chemopreventive dithiolethiones. Induction of ferritin H by β-NF and the dithiolethiones oltipraz and 1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) occurs via a transcriptional mechanism that is mediated by the ferritin H electrophile/antioxidant-responsive element (EpRE/ARE). The murine ferritin H gene contains five potential xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) sequences in its 5′-promoter region. However, deletion analysis demonstrates that these XRE sequences are not functional in inducing ferritin H in response to β-NF. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that the ferritin H EpRE/ARE binds Nrf2. Transfection of chimeric ferritin H reporter genes with Nrf2 expression vectors and Nrf2 dominant-negative mutants indicate that Nrf2 functions at the EpRE/ARE to mediate transcriptional activation of ferritin H. Induction of ferritin H and L was not seen in Nrf2 knockout cells, demonstrating that this transcription factor is required for the induction of ferritin in response to polycyclic aromatic xenobiotics and chemopreventive agents. Nrf2 may also play a role in basal transcription of both ferritin H and L. These results provide a mechanistic link between regulation of the iron storage protein ferritin and the cancer chemopreventive response.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The protein consists of 24 subunits of the H and L chain type (2Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). The ratio of subunits within the ferritin protein varies widely by tissue type; the ratio can be further modulated by environmental signals, including cytokine stimulation, stress signals, and disease state (3Kwak E.L. Larochelle D.A. Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15285-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The H chain has ferroxidase activity (5Lawson D.M. Treffry A. Artymiuk P.J. Harrison P.M. Yewdall S.J. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. Levi S. Arosio P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), whereas the L subunit is responsible for iron nucleation and protein stabilization (6Santambrogio P. Levi S. Arosio P. Palagi L. Vecchio G. Lawson D.M. Yewdall S.J. Artymiuk P.J. Harrison P.M. Jappelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14077-14083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because iron functions as a catalyst in the formation of oxygen free radicals, storage of iron by ferritin may serve a cytoprotective function (2Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have demonstrated an induction of ferritin by oxidants and pro-oxidant xenobiotics, including agents such as hydrogen peroxide (7Tsuji Y. Ayaki H. Whitman S.P. Morrow C.S.

Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Activation of ferritin by these agents is thought to be a stress response mechanism that contributes to limiting cellular and organismal damage from these xenobiotics. The induction of antioxidant and detoxification cytoprotective enzymes has been proposed as a potential strategy in cancer chemoprevention (reviewed in Ref. 12Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T. Zhang Y. Toxicol Lett. 1995; 82–83: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Chemopreventives are natural or synthetic compounds that have the ability to block or suppress carcinogenesis (13Wattenberg L.W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 216: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Dithiolethiones, including oltipraz (5-(2-pyrazinyl)-4-methyl-1,2-dithiole-3-thione), a synthetic compound currently in clinical trials, and D3T (1,2-dithiole-3-thione) are prototypical examples of such candidate chemopreventive agents (14Kensler T.W. Groopman J.D. Sutter T.R. Curphey T.J. Roebuck B.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The induction of ferritin in rats treated with the dithiolethione D3T represented an initial indication that ferritin may be among the cytoprotective proteins induced by chemopreventives (15Primiano T. Kensler T.W. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2291-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mechanisms responsible for the induction of cytoprotective proteins in response to challenge with xenobiotics, including certain chemopreventive agents, are beginning to be clarified. To date, two mechanisms responsible for the coordinate induction of antioxidant enzymes and phase II detoxification enzymes have been identified (16Prochaska H.J. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4776-4782PubMed Google Scholar). The first mechanism is dependent on an interaction between the inducer and the cytosolic aromatic hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor (17Nebert D.W. Roe A.L. Dieter M.Z. Solis W.A. Yang Y. Dalton T.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 65-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Upon binding of the ligand to the receptor, the receptor-ligand complex translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to a DNA enhancer element, termed xenobiotic responsive element (XRE). Most ligands capable of binding to the Ah receptor are polycyclic hydrocarbons, such as β-NF and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (16Prochaska H.J. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4776-4782PubMed Google Scholar). Genes regulated by this mechanism include phase I activating enzymes, such as the cytochromes P450 1A1 and 1A2 (18Denison M.S. Fisher J.M. Whitlock J.P., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Quattrochi L.C., Vu, T. Tukey R.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) (24Yoo H.Y. Chang M.S. Rho H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A second mechanism of gene activation is Ah receptor-independent and is mediated by an electrophile-responsive element (EpRE (26Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar); also known as ARE (27Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

The basal enhancer, FER-1, is in turn composed of an element with close sequence similarity to both AP1 and NF-E2 consensus sequences (previously termed AP1-like element (53Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K.

The AP1/NF-E2-like and the AP1/NF-E2 consensus sequence of the ferritin H EpRE/ARE are arranged in inverse repeat, and both of these elements are necessary for full induction of ferritin H by H2O2 and t-BHQ (7Tsuji Y. Ayaki H. Whitman S.P. Morrow C.S. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5818-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). An EpRE/ARE has also been identified in the murine ferritin L promoter (55Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Ligation of this element to a luciferase reporter gene demonstrated that the ferritin L EpRE is functional as an enhancer element in HepG2 cells treated with t-BHQ (55Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that ferritin may constitute a component of the cytoprotective response induced by xenobiotics (electrophiles or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and candidate chemopreventive agents. However, the mechanism of ferritin induction by these agents is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ferritins H and L are induced by oltipraz, D3T, and β-NF in fibroblasts and hepatic cells. Furthermore, we show that induction of ferritin occurs via an EpRE/ARE-dependent mechanism that requires Nrf2. These results link ferritin induction mechanistically to the chemopreventive response. NIH3T3, Hepa1–6, and HepG2 cell lines and Nrf2 wild type (+/+) and Nrf2 knockout (−/−) primary mouse embryo fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. NIH3T3 (ATCC) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Hepa1–6 (ATCC) and HepG2 (ATCC) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− primary mouse embryo fibroblasts were grown in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 150 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Oltipraz and D3T were provided by the Division of Cancer Prevention Repository of NCI, National Institutes of Health, and β-NF was obtained from Sigma. All compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and final Me2SO concentration in all treatment conditions was 0.4%. The following ferritin H-human growth hormone reporter gene constructs have been previously described (7Tsuji Y. Ayaki H. Whitman S.P. Morrow C.S. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell.

To construct ferritin H-luciferase reporter gene constructs −4.8kbFH-CAT (53Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was digested with HindIII to release a fragment that contains the 5′-promoter region of the ferritin H gene, from nucleotide −4819 to +24. The HindIII fragment was ligated into theHindIII multiple cloning site of pGL3 (Promega) to create −4.8kbFH-Luc. To construct −4.2kbFH-Luc, −4.0kbFH-Luc, and −0.225kbFH-Luc, −4.8kbFH-Luc was digested with SacI,BglII, and SmaI to release 616-, 789-, and 4618-bp fragments, respectively. The remaining 9.0-, 8.9-, and 5.1-kb fragments were gel-purified and religated to form −4.2kbFH-Luc, −4.0kbFH-Luc, and −0.225kbFH-Luc, respectively. The −4.8kbΔ3.5kbFH-Luc internal deletion construct was made by removing an internal EcoRI fragment from −4477 to −941 from −4.8kb FH-Luc by digestion with EcoRI and religation. The 75bpEpREFH-Luc insertion construct was made as follows. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the 75-bp ferritin H EpRE/ARE were synthesized by the Wake Forest University School of Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center DNA synthesis laboratory, PAGE-purified, phosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide kinase, annealed, and ligated into the SmaI site of −0.225kbFH-Luc. The Nrf2 dominant negative mutant expression plasmid (pEF/Nrf2dnm) as well as the empty expression plasmid (pEF) were kind gifts of Dr. Jawed Alam (56Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S.

Total RNA was isolated from cells treated for 24 h with vehicle, oltipraz, D3T, and/or β-NF as described by Chirgwin et al. (58Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar) or utilizing the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10–15 μg of RNA were size-fractionated on 1.1% agarose/6.6% formaldehyde gels and transferred to an Immobilon Ny+ nylon membrane (Millipore) by capillary transfer. DNA probes for both ferritin H (59Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L. Ringold G.M. Myambo K.B. Young A.P. Torti F.M. J. Biol.

Membranes were subjected to autoradiography; quantitation was performed using a PhosphorImager analyzer (model 445SI, Amersham Biosciences). To assess ferritin H and β-actin protein levels, cytosolic extracts were prepared as previously described by Schreiber et al. (61Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). 50 μg of protein was fractionated on 12%SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-ferritin H peptide antibody (BIOSOURCEInternational) followed by a 1:200 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). The blots were developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence System (AmershamBiosciences). To demonstrate equivalent protein loading, blots were washed and re-blotted using a 1:20,000 dilution of anti-β actin antibody (Sigma) followed by a 1:5,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem). NIH3T3 cells were transfected in duplicate with 2 or 3 μg of FH-hGH reporter gene constructs using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were allowed to recover for 20–24 h and treated with 70 μm Oltipraz, 70 μm D3T, or vehicle (Me2SO). RNA was isolated after 24 h, and RNase protection analysis (RPA) was performed as described previously (3Kwak E.L. Larochelle D.A. Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15285-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The -fold induction was calculated based on means and standard errors of three to eight independent experiments. Hepa1–6 cells were transfected for 4 h with a total of 500 ng of DNA (FH-Luc reporter gene constructs, β-galactosidase transfection control plasmid, and pUC18 as detailed in the respective figure legends) using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Cells were allowed to recover for 20–24 h and subsequently were treated with 25 μm β-NF or vehicle (Me2SO) for 24 h. Cells were harvested, lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was assessed using the Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Expression of the β-galactosidase transfection control was measured as previously described (62Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were isolated as described previously (53Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays correspond to the ferritin H AP1/NF-E2-like element (5′-CTCCATGACAAAGCATTT-3′) present in the ferritin H basal enhancer, FER-1, and the ferritin H AP1/NF-E2 consensus element (5′-AGAATGCTGAGTCACGGTG-3′). The double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) using T4 Polynucleotide kinase. Competition experiments were performed using 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides. Normal rabbit serum or Nrf2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-722x) were used in supershift experiments. DNA-protein complexes were isolated on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel (80:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Gels were dried, and DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. β-NF is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that has been used to study activation of phase 2 enzymes by both XRE- and EpRE/ARE-dependent mechanisms (23Favreau L.V.

To create a model system in which to explore the mechanism of ferritin induction by these agents, we treated cultured liver cells for varying periods of time with β-NF or oltipraz. As shown in Fig. 1, both β-NF and oltipraz induced ferritin H and L mRNA in Hepa1–6 cells in a time-dependent manner. We also performed Northern blot analysis of NIH3T3 fibroblasts treated with oltipraz and a second dithiolethione, D3T. As shown in Fig. 2, both these agents induced ferritin H and L mRNA in NIH3T3 cells. Induction of ferritin H as well as ferritin L mRNA by oltipraz in NIH3T3 cells was time-dependent and occurred as early as 3 h after treatment, with induction peaking at 24 h. mRNA induction was accompanied by an increase in ferritin protein of similar magnitude (Fig. 3). Induction of ferritin mRNA by oltipraz, D3T, and β-NF was also seen in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that β-NF, oltipraz, and D3T induce both ferritin H and L in a variety of cells, including murine and human hepatocytes and fibroblasts.Figure 2Induction of ferritin H and L mRNA by dithiolethi"

By using EPR and CD spectroscopy, we found that in the presence of Cu2+ or Zn2+, pH, cholesterol, and the length of the peptide chain influenced the interaction of these peptides with lipid bilayers. In the presence of Zn2+, Aβ40 and Aβ42 both inserted into the bilayer over the pH range 5.5–7.5, as did Aβ42 in the presence of Cu2+. However, Aβ40 only penetrated the lipid bilayer in the presence of Cu2+ at pH 5.5–6.5; at higher pH there was a change in the Cu2+ coordination sphere that inhibited membrane insertion. In the absence of the metals, insertion of both peptides only occurred at pH < 5.5. Raising cholesterol to 0.2 mol fraction of the total lipid inhibited insertion of both peptides under all conditions investigated. Membrane insertion was accompanied by the formation of α-helical structures. The nature of these structures was the same irrespective of the conditions used, indicating a single low energy structure for Aβ in membranes.

Alzheimer's disease human amyloid β-peptide large unilamellar vesicles motionally restricted lipid component POPS 16NPS, 1 palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphatidylserine TEMPO choline chloride, 4-(N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl β-amyloid precursor protein Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the memory and cognitive functions of the brain. A characteristic central nervous system histologic marker in patients with AD is accumulation of the 39–43-residue amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in morphologically heterogeneous neuritic plaques and cerebrovascular deposits (1Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Google Scholar). Aβ is derived from a proteolytic cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). This is a highly conserved and widely expressed integral membrane protein with a single membrane-spanning domain. Possible mechanisms of Aβ toxicity include formation of plasma membrane channels (2Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5113-5118Google Scholar) and generation of H2O2 through Cu2+ reduction by the peptide, which make cells more responsive to oxidative stress (3Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Google Scholar). The mechanisms may be related because reactive oxygen species may cause lipid peroxidation that leads to alterations in the order and fluidity of the bilayer lipids (4Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Levy E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Schelenberg G. Tanzi R. Wasco W. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D. Younkin S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Google Scholar) and may also lead to an increase of membrane permeability. The common change observed in cell membrane permeability is an increased intracellular calcium level (5Duff K. Eckman C. Zehr C., Yu, X. Prada C.M. Perez-tur J. Hutton M. Buee L. Harigaya Y. Yager D.

A. 1993; 90: 10573-10577Google Scholar) that could occur either indirectly through Aβ modulating an existing Ca2+channel or directly through cation-selective channels formed by Aβ. The supramolecular structure of membrane-associated Aβ, either as an ion channel or a fusogen, is unknown, although Durell et al.(7Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2137-2145Google Scholar) have developed theoretical models for the structure of ion channels formed by the membrane-bound Aβ40. Recently, Bhatia et al.(8Bhatia R. Lin H. Lal R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1233-1243Google Scholar) and Lin et al. (9Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Google Scholar) used atomic force microscopy, laser confocal microscopy, and fluorescent calcium imaging to examine in real time the acute effects of fresh and globular Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ25–35 on cultured endothelial cells. Aβ peptides caused morphological changes within minutes after treatment and led to eventual cellular degeneration. Cellular morphological changes were most sensitive to Aβ42, being seen at nanomolar concentrations and accompanied by an elevated intracellular calcium level. Atomic force microscopy of Aβ42 reconstituted in a planar lipid bilayer showed multimeric channel-like structures. Biochemical analysis showed that the predominantly monomeric Aβ peptides in solution formed stable tetramers and hexamers after incorporation into lipid membranes. In our initial study using the EPR technique (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar), we found that, in the presence of Cu2+ and Zn2+, Aβ42 formed allosterically ordered α-helical structures that penetrated negatively charged membranes. This paper extends that study to include the influence of pH, metal concentration, peptide length, and cholesterol on the conformation and incorporation of the peptide into the lipid bilayer. We show that penetration of the bilayer is closely related to conditions favorable to oligomerization of the peptide. The significance of this finding is that metals play an important part in the formation of amyloid plaques, the end point of oligomerization. Cherny et al. (11Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W.

Recently, the importance of Zn2+ in plaque formation has been emphasized by the finding that the age and female sex-related plaque formation characteristic of these mice was greatly reduced if they lacked zinc transporter 3, which is required for zinc transport into synaptic vesicles (12Lee J.-Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.Y. Koh J.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Google Scholar). Peptides were obtained from AusPep (Melbourne, Australia) and from the W. M. Keck Laboratory, Yale University. The acidic phospholipid spin label 16NPS was synthesized according to Hubbell and McConnell (13Hubbell W.L. McConnell H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 314-326Google Scholar). The water-soluble spin label TCC was obtained from Molecular Probes. All spin probes were checked for purity and to ensure that their number of spins/mol were >90% of theory (14Gordon L.M. Curtain C.C Aloia R.C. Curtain C.C. Gordon L.M. Advances in Membrane Fluidity 1: Methods for Studying Membrane Fluidity. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 25-89Google Scholar). Cholesterol and synthetic POPC was purchased from Sigma, and POPS was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Pelham, AL). LUV were prepared by the method described by Hopeet al. (15Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-56Google Scholar). Peptides as a freeze-dried powder were added to the desired concentration to a suspension of LUV in buffer, and the mixture was vortexed under N2 for 10 min at 305 K in polypropylene tubes. One hundred-millimolar stock solutions of analytical reagent grade CuCl2 or ZnCl2 were prepared, and the desired amount was added to the LUV after addition of the peptide. 0.05 m of the chelator EGTA was added to all control solutions to counter the possible effects of any trace metals present. For copper EPR measurements, 99.99% pure 65Cu (Cambridge Isotopes) was used. Metal concentrations were measured by ICP-MS (model 700, Varian), and peptide concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Uptake of peptide by the LUV was estimated by density gradient centrifugation in MetrizamideTM (Nyegaard, Oslo, Norway)-Tris buffer (pH 7.0, 0.05 m) as described by Cornell et al. (16Cornell B. Separovic F. Baldassi A. Smith R. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 67-76Google Scholar) and then measuring the extinction at 210 nm of the sub-phase. The protein concentration was estimated by using an E1cm1% of 204 (17Tombs M.P. Souter F. Maclagan N.F. Biochem. J. 1959; 73: 167-171Google Scholar). It was found that 10–15% of the added peptide was not taken up by the LUV. Continuous wave X-band EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker ECS106 spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller and flow-through liquid nitrogen cryostat. Cu2+spectra were collected at 110 K from samples contained in 4-mm inner diameter “Suprasil” quartz EPR tubes (Wilmad). In order to eliminate the possibility that any line broadening observed in the spectra might be due to freezing-induced localized concentrations of sample, 10% glycerol was added to aqueous peptide buffer solutions. Labeled lipid samples (25 μl) were contained in 0.8-mm inner diameter quartz capillaries (Wilmad) and handled as described by Gordon et al. (18Gordon L.M. Looney F.D. Curtain C.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 84: 81-95Google Scholar) to ensure reproducibility. Other procedures, including adding to the spin-labeled SUV a small amount of the water-soluble, non-membrane penetrant spin probe TCC to ensure x axis reproducibility, have been described previously (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar, 19Curtain C.C. Separovic F. Nielsen K. Craik D. Zhong Y. Kirkpatrick A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1999; 28: 427-436Google Scholar). The analysis of EPR spectra of peptide/lipid mixtures was carried out using the spectral subtraction and addition methods described by Marsh (20Marsh D. Biol. Magn. Reson. 1989; 8: 255-303Google Scholar). As a check on the validity of these procedures as applied to our system where an MRLC was observed, the lipid spin label spectra were simulated using the modified Bloch equations as described by Davoust and Devaux (21Davoust J. Devaux P. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 475-486Google Scholar). Their model I was used in the simulations where the unique director orientation in the fluid component, corresponding to the nitroxide axes being aligned along the membrane normal in the MRLC, was assumed to be preserved on exchange. CD spectra of peptides in the LUV were obtained using a CD spectropolarimeter model 62DS (AVIV, Lakewood, NJ) as described previously (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the EPR spectra recorded at 305 K of 16NPS in POPS/POPC (1/1) LUV and the same LUV containing Aβ42 before and after the addition of Cu2+(0.3/1 m peptide) at pH 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5. The sharp lines due to the TCC marker and the curved base line due to the broad Cu2+ line have been subtracted as described previously (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar). It can be seen that adding Cu2+ to the vesicles at all pH values caused the appearance of the MRLC (marked with an arrow) that is characteristic of annular phospholipid surrounding a rigid peptide inserted into the bilayer (20Marsh D. Biol. Magn. Reson. 1989; 8: 255-303Google Scholar). At pH 5.5 the spectrum of the non-Cu2+-treated Αβ-containing LUV clearly shows the MRLC, at a slightly lower intensity than in the Cu2+-treated sample at the same pH. The control spectra (set A) were subtracted from those of the Cu2+-treated LUV and from the pH 5.5 peptide-containing LUV to give the difference spectra (set D). These experiments were repeated over the same range of pH with Zn2+ (4/1 m peptide) and Aβ42 and with Cu2+ and Zn2+ at the respective 0.3 and 4.0 molar ratios with Aβ40. No MRLC was found with rat Aβ40 with both metals over the whole pH range (data not shown). By performing the subtraction with spectra of control LUV made at 286 K, as done previously with both Aβ42 (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar) and a viral peptide (19Curtain C.C. Separovic F. Nielsen K. Craik D. Zhong Y. Kirkpatrick A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1999; 28: 427-436Google Scholar), it was shown that the peptides did not perturb the bulk lipid, as suggested by McIntyre et al. (22McIntyre J. Samson P. Brenner S. Dalton L. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 53-56Google Scholar). All of the spectra could be simulated over the range of peptide/lipid mixtures used, as described by Davoust and Devaux (21Davoust J. Devaux P. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 475-486Google Scholar), further discounting long range perturbation effects on the bulk lipid by the peptide at high peptide/lipid. The on- and off-rate constants were estimated from the simulation; the former were in the range 6–5.5 × 106 (s−1), and the latter were 5.5–5 × 106 (s−1). These values are similar to those published for other lipid/protein systems (23Horvath L.I. Brophy P.J. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5296-5307Google Scholar). The proportion of MRLC to total lipid was calculated by double-integrating the five sets of difference spectra thus obtained and expressing the number of spins as a percentage of the number of spins in each experimental spectrum. The values are given in TableI. It can be seen that, with Aβ42, decreasing pH with Cu2+ and Zn2+ leads to an increase in the MRLC. It is notable that there is a significant MRLC at pH 5.5 in the absence of either metal. With Aβ40, however, there is a marked difference between the behavior of Cu2+ with pH in that there is negligible MRLC at pH 7.0 and 7.5 with the Cu2+, although with the Zn2+ the proportion of MRLC at all pH values is similar to that found with Zn2+and Aβ42. Adding Zn2+ to the pH 7.0 and 7.5 Aβ40/Cu2+ samples (2 m Zn2+/0.3m Cu2+) resulted in the appearance of the MRLC. At the lipid/peptide ratio employed (30/1), the proportion of MRLC corresponded approximately to four lipid molecules/peptide. This value was previously observed to remain constant for Aβ42 (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar) over a range of lipid/peptide ratios, and it can be satisfied on structural grounds by postulating that the basic membrane penetrant unit is a α-helical hexamer surrounded by 24 lipids (10Curtain C.C.

Difference between 100% and sum of α and β was due to conformational flexibility. We have shown previously (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar) that the appearance of the MRLC in the Aβ42 negatively charged LUV system was associated with an increase in α-helicity of the peptide. The % α-helix (bold type) and β-structure (italics) are shown alongside the MRLC data in Table I. It can be seen that wherever significant MRLC is present, the peptide showed increased α-helicity. Wherever the peptide does not show a MRLC, there is a preponderance of β-structure. EPR spectra taken at 110 K of65Cu2+-Aβ28 in buffer over the pH range 5.5–7.5 (Cu2+/peptide 0.3/1 m) are shown in Fig. 2 A. Identical spectra were obtained at the same pH values for Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the LUV and for Aβ16 in buffer. All of the spectra are characteristic of type 2 square planar copper. However, the notable feature of the series is a decrease in g∥ (marked with arrow in Fig. 2 A) between pH 5.5 and 6.0 and a further decrease between pH 7.0 and 7.5 indicating a change in the 65Cu2+coordination sphere over these two pH ranges. The spectral parameters are given in Table II. As observed previously (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar) for Aβ42, spectra for65Cu2+-Aβ40 in 16NPS-LUV showed no signs of line broadening due to dipolar-induced spin lattice relaxation by the nitroxide-free radical (24Hyde J.S. Swartz H.M. Antholine W.E. Berliner L. Spin Labeling II: Theory and Applications. Academic Press, New York1979: 71-114Google Scholar), indicating that the Cu2+-binding site of the peptide did not penetrate the bilayer and come into the proximity of the nitroxide spin label. However, Cu2+ molar ratio-dependent line broadening due to Heisenberg exchange, the result of Cu2+atoms being close in space, had been observed previously in Aβ complexes (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar). Those spectra had been recorded of samples in pH 6.9 buffer. Fig. 2 B shows the effect of a range of pH on this line broadening. It can be seen that, at the 0.7 Cu2+ molar ratio used, line broadening was present from pH 6 to 7, much reduced at pH 7.5, and eliminated at pH 8. The broadened spectrum at pH 5, which is markedly different to that seen at pH 6–7, was due to the presence of unbound Cu2+, indicating a weakening of the strong binding to the metal observed at the higher pH values, and corresponding to the protonation of the imidazole side chain of the histidine residues. There were no peaks at g >4 (not shown in Fig. 2 B), indicating the absence of axial Cu2+ dimers, nor was there any marked reduction of signal intensity, diagnostic of the formation of EPR “silent” dicopper (25Boas J.F. Pilbrow J.R. Smith T.D. Biol. Magn. Reson. 1978; 1: 277-342Google Scholar).Table IIEPR parameters of the type-2 Cu 2+ Aβ complexes at different pH valuespHg∥(±0.007)A ∥ ± (±10 MHz)g ˔ ± (±0.007)A ˔± (±10) MHz5.52.3364652.068106.02.3134672.068206.52.3084742.061237.02.2964782.055257.52.2904772.05126The hyperfine data are given for 65Cu. Open table in a new tab The hyperfine data are given for 65Cu. From Fig. 3 it can be seen that the increase in the amount of MRLC at pH 6.0 with both peptides reaches a maximum at a Cu2+ concentration of 1 mol/mol, after which it remains constant. The effect of Zn2+ follows a similar pattern, albeit at higher concentrations, requiring almost 3 eq in keeping with the lower affinity of Aβ for Zn2+(26Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. Paradis M. Vonsattel J.-P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Google Scholar). In the light of numerous reports on the significance of cholesterol on Aβ−membrane interactions in both biological membranes and model systems (27Hartmann H. Eckert A. Muller W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1185-1192Google Scholar, 28Muller W.E. Koch S. Eckert A. Hartmann H. Scheuer K. Brain Res. 1995; 674: 133-136Google Scholar, 29Muller W.E. Eckert G.P. Eckert A. Scheuer K. Cairns N. Maras A. Gattaz W.F. Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1998; 5: 10-15Google Scholar), the effect of adding cholesterol to the LUV on MRLC formation was investigated. The results are summarized in TableIII where it can be seen that at each pH value and metal where the component was observed in the absence of cholesterol it was reduced to zero when cholesterol represented 0.2 mol fraction of the total lipid, i.e. cholesterol reduced the stability of the membrane-penetrant form of the peptide.Table IIIEffect of adding cholesterol to LUV on percentages of MRLC in EPR spectra of Aβ40 and Aβ42CholesterolAβ40Aβ4200.050.10.150.200.050.10.150.2Cu2+108752119650Zn2+88751107521 Open table in a new tab Because it had been observed that the appearance of MRLC in the spin-labeled LUV after the addition of Zn2+-Aβ40 was independent of pH, and it was pH-dependent after the addition of Cu2+-Aβ40 (Table I), the effect of adding Cu2+ to Zn2+-Aβ40 LUV was explored. It can be seen (Fig. 4) that at pH 7.0 the addition of Cu2+ markedly reduced the percent MRLC until none was detectable at 1 m Cu2+/m of peptide. This result indicates that Cu2+ competes with Zn2+ for at least one of the His residues of Aβ40, but with a coordination sphere such that the stability of the complex is to too low to promote membrane insertion. The addition of metal ion and pH are two conditions that govern the formation of the MRLC indicating peptide penetration of the hydrocarbon core of the membrane by Aβ peptides in LUV (Fig. 1), and these conditions closely parallel those governing Aβ oligomerization (30Wood S.J. Maleeff B. Hart T. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 870-877Google Scholar). In the absence of metals and in the presence of the chelating agent EGTA, both Aβ40 and Aβ42 penetrate the membrane at pH 5.5 but not at higher pH values. Both peptides aggregate in the absence of either metal at this pH (30Wood S.J. Maleeff B. Hart T. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 870-877Google Scholar). In the presence of Zn2+ both peptides penetrated the membrane over the entire range from pH 5.5 to 7.5. Zn2+ aggregates Aβ across this pH range (31Huang X. Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Hartshorn M.A. Vonsattel J.-P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26464-26470Google Scholar). Aβ40 in the presence of Cu2+ only penetrated the membrane at pH 6.5 and below, pH values at which it has been reported to oligomerize (32Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C. Bacarra N.M.E. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12817-12826Google Scholar). On the other hand, Aβ42 in the presence of Cu2+ penetrates and is oligomerized in solution at all pH values. It should be noted that rat Aβ40, which has a 2N2O coordination (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar) and much-reduced metal-induced oligomerization (33Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D., N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Google Scholar), did not produce an MRLC with either metal at any pH. The significance of this result is that the selectivity of human over rat Aβ40 is one of the key metal-differentiating effects that argues strongly for metals being germane to the pathophysiology of AD. The induction of MRLC by copper-bound Aβ42 was saturated at 1 eq (Fig. 3); this parallels our previous observation that the cooperative binding of Cu2+to Aβ was also saturated at 1 eq (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar). Our results showed that membrane penetration was associated with an increase in α-helicity as determined by CD spectroscopy, whereas the CD spectra of peptide associated with liposomes showing no evidence of MRLC indicated predominantly β-structure (Table I). These results indicated that peptide association with the hydrocarbon region of the lipid bilayer facilitated α-helix formation. Previously published CD studies of the interaction between the Aβ peptides and lipid vesicles of varying composition have suggested that the peptides associated with the lipids are in the β-strand conformation (34Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1346-1350Google Scholar, 35McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Google Scholar, 36Martinez-Senac M.D. Villalain J. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 744-753Google Scholar). Most of these studies were limited to Aβ25–35, a peptide that is too short to be able to span the lipid bilayer in an α-helical conformation. On the other hand, NMR structural studies in SDS micelle systems show that residues 15–36 are α-helical with a kink in the 25–27 region (37Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Google Scholar,38Shao H. Jao S., Ma, K. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 755-773Google Scholar). Calculation of the annular lipid/peptide ratio allows an estimate of the size of the molecule/complex penetrating the membrane. For all the spectra exhibiting MLRC the same value of 4–4.5/1 was obtained, consistent with an α-helical hexameric peptide structure inserted into the bilayer in line with our previous results (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar). The constancy of this ratio over a range of peptide/lipid suggested that formation of multimers occurs at relatively low value of the latter and that their size remains constant with increasing proportion of peptide in the bilayer. Factors influencing the interpretation of the stoichiometry of lipid-protein interactions determined by EPR have been discussed in detail by Marsh and Horváth (39Marsh D. Horváth L.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 767-796Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the ion channels that have been observed in various membrane systems could consist of either strands arranged in a β-barrel conformation or as an α-helical assemblage, probably a tetramer or hexamer (see Refs. 7Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2137-2145Google Scholar, 8Bhatia R. Lin H. Lal R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1233-1243Google Scholar, 9Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Google Scholar, 10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar and the data presented here). It has been shown by Horváth et al. (23Horvath L.I. Brophy P.J. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5296-5307Google Scholar) and Wolfs et al. (40Wolfs C.J.A.M. Horváth L.I. Marsh D. Watts A. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9995-10001Google Scholar), however, that the motion of the MRLC observed with membrane penetrant segments of known β-barrel structure is much more restricted than with α-helical segments. This is because of a slower on-off rate for the lipids in the former case. The on-off rates calculated by simulation in our case are close to those observed for other α-helical systems (20Marsh D. Biol. Magn. Reson. 1989; 8: 255-303Google Scholar). Adding metal ions or lowering the pH are two different methods of aggregating Aβ. In the absence of lipid, metal ions induce amorphous aggregates of Aβ, and these oligomers are different from those formed in the pH-induced oligomerization of Aβ. These have a fibrillar β-sheet structure as shown by Congo Red birefringence (41Yoehiike Y. Tanemura K. Murayama O. Akagi T. Murayama M. Sato S. Sun X. Tanaka N. Takashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32293-32299Google Scholar). In lipid systems, however, both methods of Aβ oligomerization give the same membrane penetrating α-helical structure, suggesting a well defined low energy structure for Aβ in membranes. The observation of an α-helical hexamer is consistent with the results of the atomic force microscopy study by Lin et al. (9Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Google Scholar) that showed that Aβ peptides were able to form hexameric channel-like structures. The greater stability of Aβ42 in the lipid is also consistent with the observation by Bhatia et al. (8Bhatia R. Lin H. Lal R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1233-1243Google Scholar) showing a higher tendency by Aβ42 to form channel-like structures and a greater ability to disrupt cellular Ca2+ regulation than Aβ40. The two extra hydrophobic residues at the C terminus of Aβ42 would result in this peptide having a higher preference for the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. The effect of the extra two hydrophobic residues is amplified in the hexameric unit, as there are 12 extra hydrophobic residues per unit for Aβ42 versus Aβ40. We have shown that Zn2+ will induce Aβ penetration of the lipid with the formation of structures that are similar to the channels proposed by Lin et al. (9Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Google Scholar). However, their results showed that Zn2+ and an antibody directed against the N terminus had an inhibitory effect on Aβ channel activity (9Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Google Scholar). Although our results show that metal ions can induce oligomerization and membrane penetration, the metal-binding site itself is outside the lipid bilayer (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar). The antagonistic action of Zn2+ may be due to its ability to extensively cross-link the three histidine residues of Aβ to form a cap over the channel, physically blocking it. There is a significant reduction in Cu2+-facilitated membrane insertion of Aβ40 at pH values of 7.0 and above, contrasting with Aβ42 that showed consistent membrane insertion across the pH range investigated. Our present and earlier EPR data (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar) indicated that Cu2+ formed type 2 square planar complexes with Aβ peptides. The spectra were independent of the peptide chain length and the presence or absence of lipid, but were influenced by pH. For type 2 complexes the g ∥ andA ∥ values correlated with the types of equatorially coordinated atoms. The decrease ing ∥ (Fig. 2 A and Table II) between pH 6.0 and 5.5 and a further decrease between pH 7.0 and 7.5 indicated a change in the 65Cu2+ coordination sphere over these two pH ranges. This is further illustrated in Fig. 2 Bwhere the Cu2+ molar fraction-dependent line broadening attributed to Heisenberg exchange effects (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar) diminishes with increasing pH, suggesting a change in the coordination sphere such that the Cu2+ atoms are no longer close in space. This would be consistent with reduction in the extent of histidine bridging between Cu2+ centers, although this was not eliminated until pH 8. Such a change in the coordination mode reflects a change in the Cu2+ from a coordination sphere that promotes peptide oligomerization such as with a histidine residue bridging copper atoms (a coordination sphere that resembles the active site of superoxide dismutase) to a mode that does not. Miura et al. (42Miura T. Suzuki K. Kohata N. Takeuchi H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7024-7031Google Scholar) and Suzuki et al. (43Suzuki K. Miura T. Takeuchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 991-996Google Scholar) have shown by using Raman spectroscopy that Cu2+ binds to the N τ of the three His residues of Aβ at pH 5.8, whereas at pH 6.6 and 7.4 it could bind to the N π and an as yet unidentified backbone amide nitrogen. Zn2+, on the other hand, binds to the N τ over the pH range 5.8–7.4. A change in the coordination mode of the Cu2+bound to Aβ at higher pH that also reduces the oligomerization of the peptides would explain the observed reduction of copper-induced MLRC by Aβ40 at these pH values. These observations are consistent with the reduced aggregation of Aβ by copper at higher pH (32Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C. Bacarra N.M.E. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12817-12826Google Scholar). The extra hydrophobic stabilization of Aβ42 versus Aβ40 is able to shift the pH-induced change in equilibrium between the different coordination modes of Cu2+ back to the form that favors membrane penetration and peptide oligomerization; this is a form that resembles the active site of superoxide dismutase as we have shown previously (10Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20466-20473Google Scholar). Zn, which does not undergo a pH-induced change in metal coordination, induces peptide insertion into the membrane with both Aβ40 and Aβ42 over the pH range investigated. However, from the data shown in Fig. 4 it appears that the 1 eq of copper at pH 7.0 will displace the zinc and inhibit Aβ40 insertion into the membrane. Competition between Cu2+ and Zn2+ at this pH for binding to at least one of the histidine residues would explain these results. The different Cu2+ coordination modes and, hence, lipid interactions may explain the increased toxicity normally associated with Aβ42 because this peptide is more stable in the lipid environment. Cholesterol is a major component of mammalian cell membranes and is known to affect the dynamics and thickness of the hydrocarbon region of the membrane. It has been widely reported to modulate Aβ-membrane interactions, and there is strong circumstantial evidence that it has a role to play in AD (27Hartmann H. Eckert A. Muller W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1185-1192Google Scholar, 28Muller W.E. Koch S. Eckert A. Hartmann H. Scheuer K. Brain Res. 1995; 674: 133-136Google Scholar, 29Muller W.E. Eckert G.P. Eckert A. Scheuer K. Cairns N. Maras A. Gattaz W.F. Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1998; 5: 10-15Google Scholar). Increased membrane cholesterol reduces the membrane disordering effects of Aβ, as shown by fluorescence polarization techniques, and inhibits its effects on Ca2+ signaling (35McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Google Scholar). Our results show that enhanced membrane cholesterol has the marked effect of decreasing MRLC formation by Aβ. Penetration of the membrane by the peptides would depend on a balance between the rigidifying effects of cholesterol and the possible better match of the hydrophobic region of the peptide by the increased bilayer thickness. Because the α-helical hydrophobic regions of Aβ peptides span 22–25 residues (37Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Google Scholar), close to the 20–23-residue width of the unexpanded bilayer, it is likely that the rigidifying effects will predominate, resulting in peptide exclusion. Such exclusion in the presence of cholesterol would explain the inhibitory effects of the latter on Ca2+ signaling, because Aβ-induced channels would be destabilized in lipid rich in cholesterol. Overall, the data suggest the location and stability of Aβ peptides within the membrane is delicately balanced, and as such, small changes in pH and lipid composition would be able to affect the stability of the Aβ-lipid interactions. Because neuronal cells are in a dynamic environment, with respect to pH and lipid composition that varies with different sub-cellular membrane fractions, it is not surprising that other workers (44Muller W.E. Kirsch C. Eckert G.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 617-623Google Scholar) have found wide variations in the effects of Aβ on membrane order and fluidity in such fractions. A challenge for the future will be to define the links between the biophysical observations made in these diverse systems with the pathophysiology of AD."

https://openalex.org/W2118928636,"The selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) is an essential antioxidant enzyme known to reduce many compounds in addition to thioredoxin, its principle protein substrate. Here we found that TrxR1 reduced ubiquinone-10 and thereby regenerated the antioxidant ubiquinol-10 (Q10), which is important for protection against lipid and protein peroxidation. The reduction was time- and dose-dependent, with an apparent K(m) of 22 microm and a maximal rate of about 12 nmol of reduced Q10 per milligram of TrxR1 per minute. TrxR1 reduced ubiquinone maximally at a physiological pH of 7.5 at similar rates using either NADPH or NADH as cofactors. The reduction of Q10 by mammalian TrxR1 was selenium dependent as revealed by comparison with Escherichia coli TrxR or selenium-deprived mutant and truncated mammalian TrxR forms. In addition, the rate of reduction of ubiquinone was significantly higher in homogenates from human embryo kidney 293 cells stably overexpressing thioredoxin reductase and was induced along with increasing cytosolic TrxR activity after the addition of selenite to the culture medium. These data demonstrate that the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase is an important selenium-dependent ubiquinone reductase and can explain how selenium and ubiquinone, by a combined action, may protect the cell from oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2080864795,"The importance of Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T antigen)-galectin-3 interactions in adhesion of human breast carcinoma cells to the endothelium under conditions of flow was studied. Highly metastatic cells (MDA-MB-435) expressing high levels of both galectin-3 and T antigen demonstrated significantly increased adhesion to monolayers of endothelial cells compared with their non-metastatic counterpart (MDA-MB-468) in vitro. Within minutes of adhesion, the highly metastatic cells acquire the ability of enhanced homotypic adhesion, leading to the formation of multicellular aggregates at sites of attachment to endothelial cells in vitro.

Confocal microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed redistribution of endothelial galectin-3 to the site of heterotypic intercellular contacts, whereas galectin-3 in MDA-MB-435 cells accumulated at sites of homotypic interaction. MDA-MB-435 cells also exhibited increased adhesion and intravascular retention within the microvessels of transplanted lung allografts in nude mice.

One of the rate-limiting steps in metastatic dissemination is the adhesion of circulating cancer cells to the microvascular endothelium (for review, see Ref. 1Glinsky G.V. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1993; 14: 229-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent experimental evidence identified endothelium-attached blood-born tumor cells as the seeds of secondary tumors (2Al-Mehdi A.B. Tozawa K. Fisher A.B. Shientag L. Lee A. Muschel R.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In the lung, early metastatic colonies were entirely within the blood vessels, and hematogenous metastases originated from the intravascular proliferation of tumor cells anchored to the endothelia (2Al-Mehdi A.B. Tozawa K. Fisher A.B. Shientag L. Lee A. Muschel R.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). These results underscored the significance of intravascular intercellular adhesion in cancer metastasis. Although there is a substantial body of evidence demonstrating the role of various adhesion molecules in tumor cell adhesion (1Glinsky G.V. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1993; 14: 229-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Cooper C. Pienta K. Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis. 2000; 3: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cancer cell adhesion are still often modeled after the dynamics of the leukocyte adhesion cascade. Despite the many physical similarities, interaction of leukocytes and circulating malignant cells with the vascular endothelium are likely to be driven by distinct molecular mechanisms. For example, it is well documented that under conditions of shear force, circulating leukocytes participate in a multi-step cascade of sequential adhesion events involving rolling, adhesion, and transmigration across the vascular wall, where rolling is the first and rate-limiting step ultimately required for stable leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial cells (EC)1 (4Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to leukocytes, published data regarding the rolling and adhesion of tumor cells on vascular endothelium suggest a non-leukocyte-like mechanism (5Thorlacius H. Prieto J. Raud J. Gautam N. Patarroyo M. Hedqvist P. Lindbom L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1997; 83: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Giavazzi R. Foppolo M. Dossi R. Remuzzi A. J. Clin.

Furthermore, it is also not clear whether this step is required for stable adhesion of tumor cells to the endothelium. Leukocyte rolling is mostly mediated by the interaction of the members of C-type lectin family, selectins, with their cognate carbohydrate ligands (4Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 10Sriramarao P. von Andrian U.H. Butcher E.C. Bourdon M.A. Broide D.H. J.

Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have recently shown that another lectin, galectin-3, plays a key role in initiating the adhesion of human breast and prostate cancer cells to the endothelium by specifically interacting with the cancer-associated carbohydrate, T antigen. However, these studies were carried out under static conditions, and the relevance of galectin-3-T antigen interactions in mediating cancer cell adhesion under conditions of flow has not been investigated. Shear forces have an important influence on cell adhesion and other cellular functions, and malignant cell lines appear to possess different adhesive properties under static and dynamic conditions (14Haier J Nicolson G.L. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 126: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,15Haier J Nicolson G.L. Dis. Colon Rectum. 2001; 44: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of intercellular adhesive interactions relevant to breast cancer metastasis, we examined the adhesive behavior of two human breast carcinoma cell lines exhibiting distinct metastatic potential under conditions of flow in vitro and in vivo. Our studies have led to the identification of a novel sequence of T antigen-mediated adhesive events with galectin-3 that occur between breast carcinoma cells (homotypic) as well as between breast carcinoma cells and the vascular endothelium (heterotypic) under conditions of flow. This rapid activation of adhesive properties, resulting in the formation of multicellular aggregates at sites of primary attachment, appears to be unique to highly metastatic breast carcinoma cells, which qualitatively distinguishes their interaction with the endothelium from cells such as leukocytes and other less metastatic cells. These results underscore the potential significance of T antigen-galectin-3 interactions in mediating both homotypic and heterotypic intercellular adhesion of metastatic breast carcinoma cells under conditions of flow. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon, which could play an important role in the establishment of breast cancer micrometastasis, has not been described previously. 5-(and 6)-(((4-Chloromethyl)benzoyl)amino) tetramethylrhodamine (CMTMR), carboxyl fluorescein diacetate (CFDA), and goat Texas Red conjugated anti-rat antibody were obtained from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. The previously described MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 human breast carcinoma cell lines of distinct metastatic potential in nude mice were kindly provided by Dr. Janet E. Price, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX (16Zhang R.D. Fidler I.J. Price J.E. Invasion Metastasis. 1991; 11: 204-215PubMed Google Scholar, 17Price J.E. Polyzos A. Zhang R.D. Daniels L.M.

Hueser C.J. Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Tumor cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin (Invitrogen). Cells were grown to 70–80% confluency, detached from culture flasks using Enzyme Free Cell Dissociation Solution (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ), washed in serum-free Ultraculture media (Specialty Media), and used in adhesion experiments immediately. Simultaneous identification of live and dead cells was performed using acridine orange and ethidium bromide staining (20Parks D.R. Bryan V.M. Oli V.T. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1962-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Viability of cells used in adhesion experiments was 95% or greater. Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) and human lung microvasculature EC (HLMVEC) were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). EC were grown on coverslips pre-coated with poly-l-lysine/fibronectin (10 μg/ml) until 100% confluent in cell type-specific media (Clonetics). To ensure phenotypic stability of cells, only breast carcinoma cells having undergone less than five passages in culture were utilized for the in vitroand in vivo adhesion assays. Rolling and adhesion of infused MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells were assessed in an in vitroparallel plate laminar flow chamber as previously described (21Borgström P. Hughes G. Hansell P. Wolitzky B. Sriramarao P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2246-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Sriramarao P. DiScipio R.G. Cobb R.R. Cybulsky M. Stachnick G. Castenada D. Elices M. Broide D.H. Blood. 2000; 95: 592-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, glass coverslips were coated with poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice. EC (HUVEC or HLMVEC) were grown on the poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips till 100% confluent. The glass coverslips with the EC were then positioned in the bottom of a parallel plate flow chamber (100-μm thickness), where the coverslips were exposed to different flow conditions. Defined levels of flow (increasing wall shear stress) were applied to the coverslip in the flow chamber by perfusing warm media (RPMI containing 0.75 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 0.2% human serum albumin) through a constant infusion syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The flow chamber was next perfused with a single cell suspension of the MDA-MB-435 or MDA-MB-468 cells (5 × 104 cells/ml) for a period of 5 min. The interactions of the injected cells with the EC layer were observed using a Leitz Wetzlar inverted microscope, and the images were video-recorded for subsequent offline video analysis to manually determine the number of interacting cells. Rolling cells demonstrate multiple discrete interruptions and flow slowly, whereas adherent cells remain stationary at a given point for extended periods of time (>30 s) (22Sriramarao P. DiScipio R.G. Cobb R.R. Cybulsky M. Stachnick G. Castenada D. Elices M. Broide D.H. Blood. 2000; 95: 592-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the number of rolling or adherent cells/field (average of four fields). In some experiments, MDA-MB-435 cells were incubated for 15 min with a synthetic low molecular weight non-toxic T-antigen mimicking galectin-3 antagonist lactulosyl-l-leucine (LL) (23Glinsky G.V. Mossine V.V. Price J.E. Bielenberg D. Glinsky V.V. Ananthaswamy H.N. Feather M.S. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 253-267PubMed Google Scholar) or its non-active isomer, lactitol-l-leucine (LT) at a final concentration of 1 mm and infused through the laminar flow chamber at a shear stress of 4 dyn/cm2. In addition, MDA-MB-435 cells were also preincubated with undiluted culture supernatant of monoclonal rat anti-human galectin-3 antibody hybridoma (TIB 166 from ATCC, Manassas, VA) or normal rat IgG (10 μg/ml in RPMI) for 15 min before infusion through the laminar flow chamber. Because galectin-3 belongs to the lactose binding (β-galactosidase) group of proteins/lectins, the ability of lactose (Sigma) to inhibit binding of MDA-MB-435 cells to EC was also tested in this assay. Maltose (Sigma) was used as a control, and both sugars were tested at a final concentration of 10 mm. Dorsal skin-fold chambers in nude mice were prepared as previously described (21Borgström P. Hughes G. Hansell P. Wolitzky B. Sriramarao P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2246-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Lehr H.A. Leunig M. Menger M.D. Nolte D. Messmer K. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1055-1062PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-week-old nude mice (25–30 g) were anesthetized (a mixture of xylazine 10 mg/kg and ketamine 200 mg/kg body weight, (Western Medical Supply, Arcadia, CA)), and one pair of identical titanium frames was implanted into a dorsal skin-fold parallel to the dorsum of the animal so as to sandwich the stretched double layer of skin. One layer of the dorsal skin was completely removed in a circular area of 15-mm diameter, and the remaining underlying skin layer was covered with a coverslip incorporated into one of the frames, after which the animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia. After an additional convalescence period of 2–3 days, sections of murine lung derived from female nude mice were labeled with 5-(and 6)-(((4-chloromethyl)benzoyl)amino) tetramethylrhodamine (CMTMR) (a fluorescent dye that enables visualization of the lung allograft under an intravital video fluorescence microscope) and carefully placed into the chamber over the subcutaneous tissue. The transplanted murine lung allografts demonstrated complete revascularization within the skin chamber after 10–15 days post-transplantation 2L. Sikora, A. Johansson, S. P. Rao, G. K. Hughes, D. H. Broide, and P. Sriramarao, submitted for publication. (25Sriramarao P. Hughes G.K. Johansson A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157 (abstr.): 205Google Scholar). The ability of MDA-MB-435 versus MDA-MB-468 human breast carcinoma cells to interact with the revascularized lung microvasculature within the skin-fold chamber was investigated by intravital fluorescent microscopy. Briefly, 2.5 × 106MDA-MB 435 or MDA-MB-468 cells labeled with CFDA (22Sriramarao P. DiScipio R.G. Cobb R.R. Cybulsky M. Stachnick G. Castenada D. Elices M. Broide D.H. Blood. 2000; 95: 592-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were injected into the tail vein of nude mice. Adhesive interactions of the CFDA-labeled cells within the lung microvasculature in the skin-fold chamber were visualized by stroboscopic epi-illumination using a video triggered xenon lamp and a Leitz Ploemopak epi-illuminator employing an I2 filter block. The images were recorded through a silicon-intensified tube camera (SIT68, Dage MTI, Michigan, IN) using a X10/0.13 water immersion objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and a SVHS video recorder HC-6600 (JVC, Tokyo, Japan). Equal amounts (30 μg) of total cellular protein extracted from MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with a 2% solution of bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, galectin-3 was detected by incubation with monoclonal rat anti-human galectin-3 antibody hybridoma (ATCC) for 1 h at room temperature followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (2 h at room temperature) and developed with Sigma FAST 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma). The membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min each time in a 2% solution of bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline between steps. Samples for the analysis of the cellular distribution of T antigen were prepared as detailed in our previous studies (11Glinsky V.V. Huflejt M.E. Glinsky G.V. Deutscher S.L. Quinn T.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2584-2588PubMed Google Scholar). T antigen expression was analyzed based on binding of biotinylated T antigen-specific peanut agglutinin lectin (Sigma) and detected with neutravidin-Texas Red conjugate (Molecular Probes). Labeled cells were mounted under cover glass and examined by fluorescent microscopy. Samples for the analysis of galectin-3 cellular distribution were prepared as previously described (12Glinsky V.V. Glinsky G.V. Rittenhouse-Olson K. Huflejt M.E. Glinskii O.V. Deutscher S.L. Quinn T.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4851-4857PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were grown to confluence directly on microscope slides using the 4-well Lab-Tec II chamber slide system (NalgeNunc, Naperville, IL). MDA-MB-435 cells (5 × 104 cells/chamber) were added to the monolayer of EC and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, samples were gently rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and permeabilized in 4% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 24 h. Monoclonal rat anti-human galectin-3 (ATCC) and goat Texas Red-conjugated anti-rat antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used to visualize galectin-3. The laser-scanning confocal microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal system. The Z stacks were prepared by obtaining serial sections with 0.5-μm increments and analyzed in orthogonal projections (Y-Z and X-Z sections) using the MetaMorph Imaging System software (Universal Imaging, Hallis, NH). MDA-MB-468 or MDA-MB-435 cells (5 × 104 cells/ml) were passed through the laminar flow chamber containing HUVEC-coated coverslips at 0.8 dyn/cm2. EC and adherent tumor cells were harvested from the coverslips using a non-enzymatic cell dissociation reagent (Specialty Media), and the cells were used for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. For galectin-3 expression, 5 × 105 cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against galectin-3 (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C and washed 2 times with fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer (2% fetal calf serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline). This was followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies. For CD31 expression, phycoerythrin-labeled mAbs against CD31 (Ancell, Bayport, MN) were used. Cells incubated with appropriate isotype-matched, nonspecific phycoerythrin- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies served as the negative control. Fluorescence was analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) according to standard procedures. The ability of two human breast carcinoma cells of differing metastatic potential to roll and subsequently develop firm adhesive interactions with EC under conditions of flow was examined using a parallel plate laminar flow chamber. Single cell suspensions of MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-648 cells were passed through flow chambers containing a monolayer of primary HUVEC adhered to coverslips. Interaction of these cells with HLMVEC was also examined in addition to HUVEC since the MDA-MB-435 cells, which were originally isolated from a pleural effusion of a breast cancer patient (16Zhang R.D. Fidler I.J. Price J.E. Invasion Metastasis. 1991; 11: 204-215PubMed Google Scholar), are known to develop spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo in nude mice (17Price J.E. Polyzos A. Zhang R.D. Daniels L.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 717-721PubMed Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in the ability of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 and the poorly metastatic MDA-MB-468 cell lines to roll on HUVEC or HLMVEC under conditions of flow in vitro (data not shown). In contrast, MDA-MB-435 cells were observed to be 2–4-fold more adhesive to HLMVEC compared with MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 1). Strikingly, highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 cells demonstrated a unique ability to undergo a quick transition from rolling to stable adhesion on EC followed by rapid formation of multicellular tumor cell clumps at the site of firm adhesion, apparently due to enhanced homotypic aggregation. We observed that within a few minutes (<1.5 min) of firm adhesion of a single tumor cell to the EC, it frequently captured other rolling and floating MDA-MB-435 cells and initiated rapid formation of homotypic multicellular tumor cell aggregates at the site of primary attachment (Fig. 2). In contrast, poorly metastatic MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells failed to significantly adhere to the EC and form multicellular aggregates on the EC layer under conditions of flow (data not shown). Thus, homotypic aggregation and multicellular clump formation appears to be a novel phenomenon restricted to the highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 cells.Figure 2Formation of multicellular homotypic tumor cell aggregates by MDA-MB-435 cells. A single cell suspension of MDA-MB-435 cells (5 × 104 cells/ml) was infused through the laminar flow chamber at 0.8 dyn/cm2. The formation of homotypic multicellular clumps by MDA-MB-435 cells on HLMVEC was monitored under an inverted microscope and video-recorded as described under “Experimental Procedures” (n = 6). Soon after the adhesion of a single MDA-MB-435 cell to the EC, it frequently captured other rolling and floating MDA-MB-435 cells and initiated rapid formation of homotypic multicellular tumor cell aggregates at the site of primary attachment. The time taken for the formation of a representative homotypic multicellular MDA-MB-435 cell aggregate is shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, attempts were made to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the adhesion of highly metastatic human breast carcinoma cells to EC. Because rolling and stable adhesion of granulocytes to vascular endothelium is mediated by the engagement of L-selectin and multiple cell surface integrins (α4 or β2 integrins) (4Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 10Sriramarao P. von Andrian U.H. Butcher E.C. Bourdon M.A. Broide D.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 53: 4238-4246Google Scholar, 22Sriramarao P. DiScipio R.G. Cobb R.R. Cybulsky M. Stachnick G. Castenada D. Elices M. Broide D.H. Blood. 2000; 95: 592-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we attempted to determine if these receptors contribute to the adhesive interactions between metastatic human breast carcinoma cells and EC under conditions of flow. Our experiments revealed that pretreatment of MDA-MB-435 cells with function blocking anti-L-selectin, anti-α4, or anti-β2-integrin mAbs failed to inhibit adhesion of these cells to EC under conditions of flow (data not shown). These results suggest that leukocyte rolling and adhesion receptors are unlikely to play a role in mediating adhesive interactions between MDA-MB-435 and EC. Our previous results from static adhesion assays demonstrated that the adhesion of MDA-MB-435 to EC is mediated by the interaction of cancer-associated carbohydrate, T antigen, with the endothelium-expressed β-galactoside-binding protein galectin-3 and could be efficiently blocked by a synthetic low molecular weight compound LL (12Glinsky V.V. Glinsky G.V. Rittenhouse-Olson K. Huflejt M.E. Glinskii O.V. Deutscher S.L. Quinn T.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4851-4857PubMed Google Scholar). LL exerts its biological activity by interfering with the function of galectins (26Glinsky G. Price J.E. Glinsky V.V. Mossine V.V. Kirakova G. Metcalf J.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5319-5324PubMed Google Scholar), particularly galectin-3, by mimicking the essential structural features of T antigen and specifically blocking T antigen-galectin-3 interactions (12Glinsky V.V. Glinsky G.V. Rittenhouse-Olson K. Huflejt M.E. Glinskii O.V. Deutscher S.L. Quinn T.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4851-4857PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether LL could also interfere with the adhesive interactions of MDA-MB-435 cells with human EC under conditions of flow. The incubation of MDA-MB-435 cells with LL at a final concentration of 1 mm before infusion into the flow chamber resulted in a significant inhibition (60–80%, p < 0.05) of tumor cell rolling and adhesion to EC (Fig. 3). Furthermore, treatment with LL also inhibited the homotypic multicellular aggregation and clumping of MDA-MB-435 cells on the EC monolayer (data not shown). In contrast, the non-active isomer, LT, which failed to inhibit T antigen-mediated adhesive interactions under static conditions (12Glinsky V.V. Glinsky G.V. Rittenhouse-Olson K. Huflejt M.E. Glinskii O.V. Deutscher S.L. Quinn T.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4851-4857PubMed Google Scholar) and was used as a control, did not affect either heterotypic or homotypic adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells under conditions of flow. In addition, to confirm the involvement of galectin-3 in mediating tumor cell interactions with the endothelium, MDA-MB-435 cells were pre-incubated with anti-galectin-3 mAb (TIB 166) or lactose, including appropriate controls, before infusion in the laminar flow assay (Fig. 3). Anti-galectin-3 mAb and lactose were found to significantly inhibit (p < 0.05) MDA-MB-435 cell rolling and adhesion to EC, whereas normal rat IgG or maltose, which served as the corresponding controls, failed to alter these interactions. Overall, the flow studies demonstrate that T antigen-galectin-3 interactions may play an important role in intercellular adhesion of metastatic human breast carcinoma cells to human EC. Taken together with previous results that demonstrate that LL efficiently inhibits human breast cancer metastasis (up to 75%) in vivo in nude mice (26Glinsky G. Price J.E. Glinsky V.V. Mossine V.V. Kirakova G. Metcalf J.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5319-5324PubMed Google Scholar), these findings strongly suggest that T antigen-galectin-3 interactions could be important in metastatic dissemination of human breast cancer. Because the adhesion of metastatic MDA-MB-435 cells to EC appeared to be dependent, at least in part, on T antigen-galectin-3 interactions, we examined whether MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells exhibit differences in expression of T antigen and galectin-3. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts with anti-galectin-3 antibody (Fig. 4 A) demonstrated that highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 cells express high levels of galectin-3, whereas poorly metastatic MDA-MB-468 cells were deficient in galectin-3. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy using biotinylated T antigen-specific peanut agglutinin lectin followed by neutravidin-Texas Red conjugate showed that the highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 cells express high levels of T antigen (Fig. 4 B), in contrast to the poorly metastatic MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 4 C). The levels of T antigen expression on these cells was visualized in the pseudocolored images of the fields shown in Fig. 4,B and C (Fig. 4, D and E, respectively), where the different colors (purple,blue, green, and yellow) correspond to the level of T antigen expression, viz. withpurple being the lowest, and yellow being the highest. These results further support the possible role for T antigen and galectin-3 in defining the metastatic potential of breast carcinoma cells. Recent studies have shown that galectins support heterotypic intercellular adhesion such as the adhesion of human cancer cells to EC in static adhesion assays (11Glinsky V.V. Huflejt M.E. Glinsky G.V. Deutscher S.L. Quinn T.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2584-2588PubMed Google Scholar, 12Glinsky V.V. Glinsky G.V. Rittenhouse-Olson K. Huflejt M.E. Glinskii O.V. Deutscher S.L. Quinn T.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4851-4857PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lehr J.E. Pienta K.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Based on findings from the present study, galectin-3 appears to be an adhesion molecule that can conceivably participate in homotypic and heterotypic adhesive interactions under conditions of flow. We utilized confocal microscopy to study the intracellular distribution of galectin-3 during homo- and heterotypic intercellular adhesion of MDA-MB-435 and EC. Confocal microscopy of a homotypic aggregate of the MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells adhered to a HUVEC monolayer using rat anti-galectin-3 followed by goat Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies is shown in Fig. 5 A. Galectin-3 molecules in the MDA-MB-435 and EC were found to exhibit distinct intracellular redistribution. Pseudocolored images of the orthogonal sections through the YZ and XZ planes of the field shown in Fig. 5 A revealed a rapid redistribution of endothelial galectin-3 to the site of heterotypic intercellular contacts (Fig. 5 B), whereas galectin-3 in MDA-MB-435 cells accumulates at the site of homotypic intercellular contacts (Fig. 5 C). Different colors represent different concentrations of galectin-3 (with purple being the lowest, and yellow being the highest). A clustering of the galectin-3 on EC at the sites of their contact with MDA-MB-435 cells (yellow arrows) and on MDA-MB-435 cells at the sites of homotypic contact with other MDA-MB-435 cells (red arrows) was observed. In contrast, a monolayer of EC before adhesion was found to show a uniform, low level basal distribution of galectin-3 (Fig. 5 D). This adhesion-dependent galectin-3 activation appears to be specific since no changes were detected in the intracellular distribution as well as cell surface expression of galectin-1 (data not shown). In the next set of experiments, we examined the cell surface expression of galectin-3 on EC before and after interaction with highly or poorly metastatic human breast carcinoma cells under conditions of flow. Breast carcinoma cells were infused in the flow chamber at low shear rates to facilitate maximal interaction with the endothelial monolayer immobilized on coverslips. Thereafter, both EC and adherent tumor cells were harvested from the coverslip, and the cell surface expression of galectin-3 was determined by flow cytometry. The expression of galectin-3 on breast carcinoma cells remained relatively unaltered before and after interaction with EC (data not shown). In contrast, the expression of galectin-3 on EC (CD31 positive population) increased significantly after interaction with highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 cells but not with the poorly metastatic MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells (Fig. 6). These results support our previously reported observation that T antigen is able to induce galectin-3 mobilization to the cell surface in human EC (12Glinsky V.V. Glinsky G.V. Rittenhouse-Olson K. Huflejt M.E. Glinskii O.V. Deutscher S.L. Quinn T.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4851-4857PubMed Google Scholar). To corroborate that the distinct intercellular adhesive interactions observed in vitro are relevantin vivo, we visualized the adhesive interactions between human breast carcinoma cells of high and low metastatic potential and murine lung microvasculature in vivo by intravital microscopy. To examine this, MDA-MB-435 or MDA-MB-468 cells stained with 5-CFDA were injected into the tail vein of nude mice transplanted with lung allografts derived from female nude mice. Passage of the fluorescently labeled tumor cells within the re-vascularized blood vessels of the transplanted lung allograft in the skin chamber was monitored by intravital fluorescence video microscopy. Analysis of recorded images revealed that metastatic MDA-MB-435 cells have a greater propensity to engage in stable adhesion with the lung microvasculature, whereas only a few non-metastatic MDA-MB-468 cells remained adherent in the revascularized lung microvessels (Fig. 7). The observed differences between MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in their mode of interaction and retention within the lung microvascular endothelium in vivosuggests that the attachment of MDA-MB-435 to microvascular endothelium could be relevant to metastasis and is mediated by specific adhesion mechanisms differentially manifested by the MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Adhesive interactions between human cancer cells (breast and prostate) and EC under static conditions have previously been shown to be mediated at least in part by the galectin-3 expressed on EC and T antigen expressed on cancer cells (12Glinsky V.V. Glinsky G.V. Rittenhouse-Olson K. Huflejt M.E. Glinskii O.V. Deutscher S.L. Quinn T.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4851-4857PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have further expanded on these findings by describing the adhesive interactions of breast carcinoma cells and EC under conditions of flow as well asin vivo in a mouse skin-fold chamber model. Results presented indicate that T antigen-galectin-3 interactions mediate both homotypic intercellular adhesion of metastatic MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells as well as the heterotypic adhesion of these cells to human EC under conditions of flow. Several independent lines of experimental evidence suggest that the T antigen-mediated adhesion mechanisms described herein may be relevant to the metastatic processin vivo. This suggestion is supported by the increased adhesion of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 cells, which expresses high levels of T antigen and galectin-3 (Fig. 4, A–E), to lung mirovasculature in the mouse skin-fold chamber model in vivo in contrast to the poorly metastatic MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 7). LL, the synthetic T antigen-mimicking molecule that has previously been shown to interfere with adhesive interactions between EC and MDA-MB-435 cells in static adhesion assays in vitro (12Glinsky V.V. Glinsky G.V. Rittenhouse-Olson K. Huflejt M.E. Glinskii O.V. Deutscher S.L. Quinn T.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4851-4857PubMed Google Scholar) as well as anti-galectin-3 mAb and lactose were found to inhibit adhesive interactions between EC and MDA-MB-435 cells under conditions of flow, further establishing the functional role of galectin-3 in these interactions. Furthermore, LL is also known to inhibit MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma metastasis in mice (26Glinsky G. Price J.E. Glinsky V.V. Mossine V.V. Kirakova G. Metcalf J.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5319-5324PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the adhesion mechanisms mediated by T antigen-galectin-3 interactions may play an important role in the spread of human breast carcinoma cells from primary orthotopic sites to secondary metastatic sites such as the lungs. This type of carbohydrate-lectin interaction involving certain cancer-associated glycoantigens may play a significant role in promoting adhesion between metastatic cancer cells and human EC under flow conditions as well. Consistent with this idea, poorly metastatic MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells that express significantly reduced levels of both galectin-3 and T antigen (Fig. 4, A–E) failed to induce galectin-3 expression on EC and did not demonstrate enhanced homotypic aggregation after adhesion to EC under flow conditions (data not shown). Based on our results, we propose a model describing the molecular mechanisms involved in T antigen-mediated homo-and heterotypic adhesive interactions of MDA-MB-435 cells and EC under conditions of flow that could be highly relevant to breast cancer metastasis (Fig. 8). According to this model, the initial adhesive interactions mediated by the T antigen expressed on cancer cells and galectin-3 expressed on EC causes a rapid increase in the cell surface expression and intracellular redistribution of endothelial galectin-3 to the sites of heterotypic intercellular contact, whereas galectin-3 in cancer cells accumulates at the site of homotypic intercellular interactions (Fig. 5). Within minutes of the initial adhesive interactions between metastatic cancer cells and the endothelium, the “primed” adhesive hot spots on the endothelium acquire dramatically enhanced adhesive properties and are able to “capture” rolling and floating carcinoma cells. This process results in rapid formation of multicellular homotypic aggregates of cancer cells at the multiple sites of primary attachment on EC under conditions of flow. Initiated by the primary adhesive interaction with the endothelium, homotypic aggregation of cancer cells could facilitate local microcirculatory aberrations and promote intravascular mechanical trapping. In addition, because enhanced homotypic aggregation of metastatic cancer cells has been shown to correlate with their ability to survive and resist apoptosis (18Glinsky G.V. Glinsky V.V. Cancer Lett. 1996; 101: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Glinsky G.V. Glinsky V.V. Ivanova A.B. Hueser C.J. Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,27Glinsky G.V. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the homotypic aggregates of endothelium-attached cancer cells may promote intravascular survival of metastatic cancer cells and serve as the seeds of early metastatic colonies. Consistent with this idea, recent experiments show that metastatic cancer cells exhibit increased resistance to circulatory stress-induced apoptosis in vivoin contrast to poorly metastatic cancer cells (28Wong C.W. Lee A. Shientag Lee Yu J. Dong Y. Kao G., Al- Mehdi A.B. Bernhard E.C. Muschel R.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 333-338PubMed Google Scholar). Presented here is a novel adhesion mechanism adopted by breast carcinoma cells under conditions of flow that is unique to metastatic breast cancer cells, such as MDA-MB-435 cells, and distinct from the adhesive behavior of other cancer cells that have thus far been studied or even leukocytes. Analysis of the adhesive behavior of six human tumor cell lines of different histological origin under conditions of flow indicated that none of the tumor cells rolled on venular endothelium in contrast to the rolling behavior of leukocytes (5Thorlacius H. Prieto J. Raud J. Gautam N. Patarroyo M. Hedqvist P. Lindbom L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1997; 83: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, three of the tumor cell lines tested (HT-29, DLD-1, and HCT-8) were strongly positive for the oligosaccharides Lewis(x), sialyl-Lewis(x), and sialyl-Lewis(a), which are recognized by the endothelial selectins that support leukocyte rolling. Initial microvascular arrest of metastasizing tumor cells was found to be dependent primarily on mechanical factors rather than on receptor-mediated leukocyte-like adhesive interactions (5Thorlacius H. Prieto J. Raud J. Gautam N. Patarroyo M. Hedqvist P. Lindbom L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1997; 83: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In other studies, HT-29 colon carcinoma cells were found to roll on E-selectin-coated surfaces without subsequent adhesion but did not exhibit rolling or adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-coated surfaces under physiological flow conditions. A375M melanoma cells, on the other hand, massively adhered to vascular cell adhesion molecule-coated surfaces but not to surfaces coated with E-selectin (6Giavazzi R. Foppolo M. Dossi R. Remuzzi A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3038-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). More recent studies showed that HT-29 cells also adhere to collagen I using the β1 integrins under flow conditions (8Haier J. Nasralla M.Y. Nicolson G.L. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rolling of KS breast carcinoma cells on vascular endothelium in vivo is mediated by CD24, a small mucin-type glycophosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface molecule, in a P-selectin-dependent manner (7Aigner S. Ramos C.L. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Lawrence M.B. Friederichs J. Altevogt P. Ley K. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Analogous to the differential expression of galectin-3 and T antigen by metastatic (MDA-MB-435) versus non-metastatic (MDA-MB-468) cells observed in the present study, CD24 is also differentially expressed in breast carcinomas (cytoplasmic pattern) versus benign breast lesions (apical pattern), and this differential expression is thought to constitute an important adhesion pathway in cancer metastasis (29Fogel M. Friederichs J. Zeller Y. Husar M. Smirnov A. Roitman L. Altevogt P. Sthoeger Z.M. Cancer Lett. 1999; 143: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). More recently, a cell surface variant rather than the standard form of CD44 has been shown to support in vitro lymphoma rolling on hyaluronic acid substrate and its in vivo accumulation in the peripheral lymph nodes (30Wallach-Dayan S.B. Grabovsky V. Moll J. Sleeman J. Herrlich P. Alon R. Naor D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3463-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, under flow conditions, cells from different tumor types appear to interact with the endothelial surface by different mechanisms, depending on adhesion molecules expressed on the tumor and endothelial cell surface. Hematogenous spread of tumor cells and metastasis formation in secondary organs are insidious aspects of cancer. The two major concepts describing cancer metastasis are based either on the adhesion of cancer cells to the blood vessel endothelia (seed and soil hypothesis) or homotypic cancer cell aggregation (mechanical trapping theory) as a key component of the metastatic cascade (1Glinsky G.V. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1993; 14: 229-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we have shown a unique sequence of homo- and heterotypic adhesive interactions of metastatic cells involving a rapid activation of both homo- and heterotypic adhesion of cancer cells after initial attachment to the endothelial layer under conditions of flow that are dependent on the engagement of galectin-3 and T antigen. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the potential unification of the two major concepts of cancer cell metastasis (seed and soil hypothesis and mechanical trapping theory). Our data provide further justification for application of the anti-adhesion cancer therapy for intravascular targeting of cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2139679033,"We report here that PLC-gamma isoforms are required for agonist-induced Ca2+ entry (ACE). Overexpressed wild-type PLC-gamma1 or a lipase-inactive mutant PLC-gamma1 each augmented ACE in PC12 cells, while a deletion mutant lacking the region containing the SH3 domain of PLC-gamma1 was ineffective. RNA interference to deplete either PLC-gamma1 or PLC-gamma2 in PC12 and A7r5 cells inhibited ACE. In DT40 B lymphocytes expressing only PLC-gamma2, overexpressed muscarinic M5 receptors (M5R) activated ACE. Using DT40 PLC-gamma2 knockout cells, M5R stimulation of ER Ca2+ store release was unaffected, but ACE was abolished. Normal ACE was restored by transient expression of PLC-gamma2 or a lipase-inactive PLC-gamma2 mutant. The results indicate a lipase-independent role of PLC-gamma in the physiological agonist-induced activation of Ca2+ entry."

In the presence of polyamines, both the lag and transition times were significantly shorter. All three polyamines accelerated the aggregation and fibrillization of α-synuclein to a degree that increased with the total charge, length, and concentration of the polyamine.

At the end of the transition phase, α-synuclein formed long fibrils in all cases, although some morphological variations were apparent. In the presence of polyamines, fibrils formed large networks leading ultimately to condensed aggregates. In the absence of polyamines, fibrils were mostly isolated.

Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Google Scholar) but undergoes aggregation leading to fibrillar structures, in which it adopts a β-sheet secondary structure. The conformational transition of α-synuclein into a β-sheet structure and the fibrillization process are believed to occur concurrently (7Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Google Scholar), although the mechanism is as yet unclear. The formation of fibrils with an ordered β-sheet structure from monomeric protein components is associated with many other diseases, including AD, Huntington's disease, diabetes, and prion diseases (8Serpell L.C.

Therefore, understanding the mechanism of fibrillization and the factors modulating the aggregation process is essential for devising therapeutic strategies against these diseases. Depending on the structure of the aggregates formed, they are classified either as amorphous, lacking ordered structures, or as fibrils, exhibiting a β-sheet secondary structure. Both types of aggregates occur in Lewy bodies (13Kim Y.S. Lee D. Lee E.K. Sung J.Y. Chung K.C. Kim J. Paik S.R. Brain Res. 2001; 908: 93-98Google Scholar, 14Ostrerova-Golts N. Petrucelli L. Hardy J.

Based on the amino acid sequence, three distinct domains have been identified in α-synuclein: (i) the N-terminal amphipathic region, rich in amino acids with a high propensity for α-helix formation, and known to be involved in binding to cell membranes and lipids, (ii) the central hydrophobic region (amino acids 61- 95), and (iii) the acidic C-terminal region in which most of the negatively charged amino acids are located (16Davidson W.S.

The recent identification of dopamine and its structural analogs as ligands for α-synuclein that inhibit the formation of mature fibrils (27Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Google Scholar) offers new perspectives for the utilization of small molecules to control the process of α-synuclein aggregation/fibrillization. In this work we studied the aggregation of α-synuclein in the presence of the biogenic polyamines putrescine (H2N(CH2)4- NH2), spermidine (H2N(CH2)3NH(CH2)4NH2), and spermine (H2N(CH2)3NH(CH2)4NH(CH2)3NH2). Polyamines are naturally occurring organic cations involved in a large number of cellular functions, including DNA replication, transcription, and protein synthesis (28Pegg A.E. McCann P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Google Scholar, 29Abraham A.K. Med. Biol. 1981; 59: 368-373Google Scholar). The cellular concentration of spermine is ∼1 mm, with higher concentrations reported for putrescine and spermidine (30Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 285-306Google Scholar, 31Sarhan S. Seiler N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 1279-1284Google Scholar, 32Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Google Scholar). Due to their cationic nature, polyamines interact with polyanionic molecules such as DNA and RNA and induce structural changes dependent on the nucleotide sequence. In addition to their positive charge, the hydrophobicity of the polyamines is another important factor modulating their interaction with other macromolecules. Polyamines are present in neuronal cells (33Slotkin T.A. Bartolome J. Brain Res. Bull. 1986; 17: 307-320Google Scholar, 34Gilad G.M. Gilad V.H. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1986; 4: 195-208Google Scholar). Although systematic function studies of their role are lacking, they are known to play a role in the interaction with neurotransmitter receptors,e.g. the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, and ion channels, e.g. K+ (35Rock D.M.

The polyamine levels in the substantia nigra of diseased human brains of individuals exhibiting neurological disorders, including PD, are not lowered, suggesting that the regulation of the substances is well maintained even in degenerating cells (37Vivo M. de Vera N. Cortes R. Mengod G. Camon L. Martinez E. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 304: 107-111Google Scholar). Spermine may serve to protect neuronal cells from oxidative stress (38Yatin S.M. Yatin M. Varadarajan S. Ain K.B. Butterfield D.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 63: 395-401Google Scholar), a condition known to induce aggregation of the amyloid Aβ peptide, the major component of amyloid deposits associated with Alzheimer's disease. It was also shown in cultured neuronal cells that the Aβ peptide combined with spermine is more toxic than the peptide alone (39Morrison L.D. Cao X.C. Kish S.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 288-294Google Scholar). A possible role for these cations in the aggregation of α-synuclein has not been proposed. Although α-synuclein is present both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neuronal cells, insoluble protein aggregates form exclusively in the cytoplasm (40Kahle P.J. Neumann M. Ozmen L. Mueller V. Jacobsen H. Schindzielorz A. Okochi M. Leimer U. van der Putten H. Probst A. Kremmer E. Kretzschmar H.A. Haass C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6365-6373Google Scholar, 41McLean P.J. Ribich S. Hyman B.T. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 2000; 58: 53-63Google Scholar). Polyamines are present in the cytoplasm at concentrations regulated by biosynthesis and by uptake mediated by the polyamine transport proteins (42Bacharach U. Wand Y. Tabib A. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 106-109Google Scholar, 43Bernstein H.G. Muller M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 57: 485-505Google Scholar, 44Gilad G.M. Balakrishnan K. Gilad V.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 268: 33-36Google Scholar). Thus, an intriguing possibility is that the subcellular co-localization of α-synuclein and polyamines in the cytoplasm may facilitate their interaction. Indeed, our results suggest that polyamines at physiologically relevant concentrations may serve to modulate the aggregation and fibrillization of α-synuclein in vivo. The recombinant plasmid pT7-7, encoding α-synuclein, was kindly provided by the laboratory of Peter Lansbury. The plasmid was transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3), and α-synuclein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cell pellet was collected by centrifugation at 4500 × g, resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol), freeze-thawed three times, and sonicated. DNA was removed by precipitation with streptomycin (10 mg/ml) and centrifugation at 22,000 × g (rotor JA-20, Beckman Avanti J-25 centrifuge) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, incubated in a boiling water bath for 20 min, and centrifuged at 22,000 × g. α-Synuclein was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to the supernatant (final concentration, 361 mg/ml) and centrifuged at 22,000 ×g. The precipitate was resuspended in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, applied to a Poros HQ column of a Biocad gel perfusion chromatographic system (Applied Biosystems), and eluted with a NaCl gradient (final concentration, 300 mm) in the same buffer. The protein fractions were collected, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and concentrated with Millipore Centricon filters. The purity was >95% according to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, and analytical gel filtration. The protein was quantitated spectroscopically using a molar extinction coefficient at 274 nm of 5600 m−1 cm−1 (6Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Google Scholar). α-Synuclein (70 μm) was incubated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C with vigorous stirring (magnetic bar) in glass vials. The polyamines putrescine-2HCl, spermidine-3HCl, and spermine-4HCl were purchased from Sigma. Concentrated stock solutions were prepared in distilled water and diluted into the protein solutions in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The pH of the solution was measured after polyamine addition, and no significant change was observed. Aliquots were removed from the incubation mix at different time intervals and diluted to appropriate concentrations for CD and fluorescence measurements. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. 15 μl of the protein solution, incubated with stirring in buffer alone or in buffer supplemented with polyamines at 37 °C, was diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final volume of 200 μl for CD measurements in cuvettes of 1-mm path length. These diluted samples were not stirred further. The spectra were buffer-subtracted, and three scans were averaged. After incubation, protein solutions were diluted 40-fold with 20 μm thioflavin T (thio T) (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fluorescence was measured on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer in 1-cm path length quartz cuvettes. Emission spectra (470–650 nm) were recorded for excitation at 450 nm, using a 5-nm band-pass for both excitation and emission. The contribution of unbound thio T to the fluorescence was measured on a thio T sample at the same concentration but in the absence of α-synuclein. The 40-fold diluted concentrations of polyamines in the fluorescence assay did not exert an effect on the fluorescence intensity of free thio T. An aliquot was withdrawn from the incubation mixture and placed onto a glow-discharged carbon film attached to an EM grid. Carbon films, 3- to 4-nm thick, were pretreated by glow discharge in the presence of pentylamine vapor (residual pressure, ∼150 millitorr; discharge current, 2–3 mA; duration of discharge, 30 s) as described elsewhere (45Dubochet J. Ducommun M. Zollinger M. Kellenberger E. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1971; 35: 147-167Google Scholar). The adsorption continued for 1–2 min, after which the grids were rinsed with a few drops of 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, blotted with filter paper, and dried. The samples were examined with a Philips CM12 electron microscope. The negatives were scanned with a DuoScan T2500 scanner (Agfa) at 1200 dots per inch. Micrographs were measured using Image software (National Institutes of Health) modified for Windows. For printing, images were flattened using a high pass filter with a radius of 250 pixels and subsequently adjusted for contrast/brightness using Adobe Photoshop. SFM images were acquired on a Digital Instruments Nanoscope III microscope. A 2.5 μmsolution of α-synuclein in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was deposited onto a freshly cleaved mica surface. The SFM head equipped with a fluid cell was placed on the top of the J-Scanner, and more protein solution was added to the fluid cell. Imaging was performed in liquid in tapping mode. Cantilevers (NP-S, Digital Instruments) with a nominal spring constant of 0.32 newtons/m were used at an oscillation frequency of ∼9 kHz. For the imaging of α-synuclein fibrils, 0.5 mm MgCl2 was added to the incubation buffer before imaging. Samples containing polyamines were imaged without added magnesium. Thioflavin T is a weakly fluorescent dye in the free state but strongly fluorescent when bound to amyloidogenic proteins in their aggregated state (25Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Google Scholar, 46LeVine 3rd, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Google Scholar). The fluorescence changes accompanying the binding of thio T to α-synuclein before and after aggregation are depicted in Fig. 1. Thio T fluorescence was very weak when the assay was performed immediately upon initiating the incubation. After a lag time of ∼22 h, the intensity increased and reached a limiting value after ∼52 h (inset). The variation of fluorescence emission intensity of thio T in the presence of α-synuclein incubated with putrescine, spermidine, and spermine is depicted in Fig. 2,A, B, and C, respectively. Putrescine was used at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 mm. In the presence of 1 mm putrescine, the increase in initial intensity occurred after 10 h and reached a plateau at ∼18 h. At higher putrescine concentration, the kinetics of fibrillization was faster, reflected in a decrease in the lag time for the thio T intensity signal (e.g. to 4 h for 10 mmputrescine). Spermidine was more efficient than putrescine in promoting α-synuclein aggregation. An enhanced aggregation rate was observed at a spermidine concentration as low as 100 μm (Fig. 2 B). The lag time decreased with increasing polyamine concentration. At 2 mm spermidine, the lag time was 6 h, and saturation in the binding profile occurred after 9 h with the development of visible turbidity. Spermine was the most effective of the polyamines in inducing the aggregation of α-synuclein (Fig. 2 C). This tetra-cationic polyamine promoted aggregation at a very low concentration (10 μm). For α-synuclein incubated with 100 μm spermine, the lag time was ∼2 h and saturation in the binding profile occurred after 9 h. Aggregation was visible at spermine concentrations ≥100 μm. A qualitative comparison of the efficiency of different polyamines to promote α-synuclein aggregation, characterized by the lag timet 1, the time at which initial increase in thio T intensity was observed, and transition time t 2, the incubation time at which the kinetic profile was saturated, is given in Table I. Because the plateau values in the kinetic curves of α-synuclein aggregated under different conditions were different, t 2 was calculated from individual saturation values. In the absence of polyamines, the increase in thio T fluorescence was complete at ∼52 h with the inception of aggregation at ∼22 h. In the presence of 2 mm spermidine and 100 μm spermine, the lag time decreased to ∼6 and 2 h, respectively, with saturation in the fluorescence signal at ∼9 h.Table IEffect of increasing concentrations of polyamines on the aggregation kinetics of α-synucleinPolyamineConcentrationt 1t 2mmhNone∼22∼52Putrescine1∼10∼185∼5∼1410∼4∼8Spermidine0.1∼10∼260.5∼8∼162∼6∼9Spermine0.01∼10∼260.025∼9∼150.1∼2∼9t 1 and t 2 are the lag and transition times, respectively, determined from the initial increase and saturation of the thio T kinetic profile. Open table in a new tab t 1 and t 2 are the lag and transition times, respectively, determined from the initial increase and saturation of the thio T kinetic profile. The CD spectrum of native α-synuclein was characterized by a strong negative CD band in the 195- to 200-nm region, indicative of a disordered structure. In contrast, the aggregated form had a positive band at ∼200 nm, and a negative band at ∼220 nm corresponding to a β-sheet structure (Fig. 3 A). This transition in secondary structure to a β-sheet is a characteristic structural feature of α-synuclein aggregation and fibrillization (6Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Google Scholar, 25Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Google Scholar). CD studies of native α-synuclein incubated with 10 mmputrescine (Fig. 3 B), 2 mm spermidine, or 100 μm spermine (Fig. 3 C) were carried out at three time points (0, 8, and 24 h). In all three cases, CD spectra measured immediately after addition of the polyamine to the monomeric protein (t = 0 data point) were indistinguishable from the CD spectrum of the protein alone. After 8-h incubation with 10 mm putrescine, the sign of the ellipticity of the band in the 200-nm region changed from negative to positive, with a concurrent increase in negative ellipticity at 220 nm, indicating that a significant fraction of the protein was converted to a β-sheet configuration. After 24 h, the positive ellipticity at 200 nm and the negative ellipticity at 220 nm increased further. No additional CD spectral changes were detected at later times. Incubation of α-synuclein with 2 mm spermidine for 8 h at 37 °C yielded a turbid solution. The CD signal was very weak and noisy, suggesting that the protein had precipitated (data not shown). The spectral properties of the solution after 24 h were similar. The CD spectral changes associated with the aggregation of α-synuclein in the presence of 100 μm spermine are depicted in Fig. 3 C. After incubation for 8 h, the sample was visibly turbid, but the circular dichroism spectrum was still characteristic of a disordered structure, albeit of lower intensity. However, the CD spectrum measured after 24 h showed a spectral pattern characteristic of a β-sheet structure, but with a decreased absolute ellipticity compared with that of the β-sheet conformation achieved in the absence of polyamines, suggesting an increased solubility of the aggregates with time. We conclude that visible aggregates formed at earlier time points may have acted as nucleation centers for fibril formation or, alternatively, that the formation of ordered structures from aggregates proceeded very slowly. The structures of α-synuclein aggregates formed upon incubation with and without polyamines for 6 h, 3 days, and 7 days were examined by EM. Aggregates formed in the absence of any polyamines after a 3-day incubation (Fig. 4 A) were seen as long fibrils (width ∼13 nm), often forming large networks, and distributed rather uniformly on the surface of the carbon film. In the presence of polyamines, the structure of aggregates varied with polyamine nature and incubation time. Fig. 4 (B and C) shows EM images of α-synuclein after a 6-h incubation with 1 mmspermidine and 0.5 mm spermine, respectively. In the presence of spermidine, α-synuclein formed small aggregates of variable size, whereas in the presence of spermine small aggregates co-existed with short fibrils. At long incubation time (3 days), the samples displayed a fibrillar structure regardless of the nature of the polyamine; this structure was qualitatively similar to that formed in the absence of polyamines. However, the nets were slightly larger and more condensed, possibly indicative of an increased adhesiveness of the fibrils. Two examples are shown in Fig. 4 (D andE) corresponding to α-synuclein incubated with 5 mm putrescine and 10 μm spermine, respectively. Incubation for 12 days in 1 mm spermidine led to highly condensed aggregates, unevenly distributed over the carbon surface (Fig. 4 F). We speculate that these aggregates represented stacks of individual fibrils. The structure of protein fibrils is associated with a range of morphologies differing in structural parameters such as fibril length, width, height, twist, and helical periodicity (8Serpell L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Google Scholar, 47Chamberlain A.K. MacPhee C.E. Zurdo J. Morozova-Roche L.A. Hill H.A. Dobson C.M. Davis J.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 3282-3293Google Scholar, 48Fink A.L. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: R9-R23Google Scholar). SFM constitutes a powerful tool for visualizing and studying fibril morphology (47Chamberlain A.K. MacPhee C.E. Zurdo J. Morozova-Roche L.A. Hill H.A. Dobson C.M. Davis J.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 3282-3293Google Scholar, 49Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Google Scholar). In the absence of polyamines and after a long incubation time (48 h), α-synuclein formed isolated fibrils ∼12 nm in height (Fig. 5 A). In samples incubated with polyamines, protein aggregates were seen at time points as early as 4 h. The fibrils formed in the presence of spermidine were isolated, short entities with mean heights of ∼12 nm (Fig. 5 B), whereas spermine induced formation of large aggregates displaying a highly diffuse structure (Fig. 5 C). Similar aggregates formed in the presence of 1 mm spermidine but required longer (24 h) incubation (Fig. 5 D). In 5 mm putrescine α-synuclein formed large aggregates consisting of clearly visible individual short fibrils (Fig. 5,E and F, for 24-h and 4-day incubations, respectively). The aggregation of α-synuclein into ordered fibrils is a kinetically slow process involving the formation of a β-sheet structure by the natively unfolded protein (50Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11604-11613Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that biogenic polyamines may play a role in accelerating this process. α-Synuclein has 24 negatively charged residues, the majority of which are located in the C-terminal domain. The presence of this acidic region and the hydrophobic region located between the C and N termini provide binding targets for cationic and hydrophobic molecules that could enhance the aggregation process. The polyamines are multivalent cations with aliphatic hydrocarbon chains separating the charges, and thus could potentially bind to α-synuclein via both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The potency with which polyamines facilitate aggregation correlates with their cationic charge and the number of aliphatic carbon chains between the amino/imino groups. Thus, the tetracationic spermine with three hydrocarbon chains is more potent than the lower homologs spermidine and putrescine. Presumably, the greater number of charges located further apart by flexible linkers permit more effective interactions with different regions of the same protein or between different proteins. Because hydrophobic interactions are important for holding different β-sheets together and are thus essential features of the aggregation process, molecules that can bind to the hydrophobic region but do not form β-sheets by themselves are being developed and screened as drugs against diseases characterized by the formation of protein aggregates (51Giasson B.I. Murray I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Google Scholar). The model suggested by Uversky et al. (18Uversky V.N., Li, J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Google Scholar) for metal ion-induced fibrillization of α-synuclein is relevant to the present study. As in the case of multivalent metal ions, polyamines may act by bridging the carboxylate groups from the same protein or from different proteins, thereby promoting aggregation. However, the aggregation pathways may be different because the metal ions induce a partially folded conformation of α-synuclein, whereas no such secondary structural transition is observed in the presence of polyamines. The ability of spermine to induce the aggregation, at a concentration of about 1/10 that of spermidine and 1/100 that of putrescine, cannot be explained by simple electrostatic considerations. As discussed above, hydrophobic interactions may be responsible for the higher potential of spermine to promote α-synuclein aggregation at physiologically relevant concentrations. α-Synuclein aggregation is a cooperative process characterized by a significant lag time. In addition to reducing the lag time, polyamines also enhance the cooperativity of the transition. Saturation in the kinetic profile is reached ∼7 h after inception for α-synuclein incubated with 2 mm spermidine or 100 μmspermine, compared with ∼30 h for α-synuclein incubated alone (Fig. 2 and Table I). The enhancement of the aggregation rate in the presence of polyamines reported here may serve to devise faster aggregation assays, a major goal in the screening of large numbers of potential drug molecules for the prevention or inhibition of fibrillization. A competition assay in the presence of a ligand like spermine could be carried out in hours rather than the many days currently required for α-synuclein aggregation in the absence of added ligands. The formation of fibrils from natively unfolded protein is presumed to involve at least four species in the aggregation pathway, which follows the scheme, UN→I→P→FSCHEME1where UN, I, P, and F represent the initial unfolded state, initial nucleation sites containing proteins in a conformation suitable for protein-protein interactions, protofibrils, and the mature fibrils, respectively (52Come J.H. Fraser P.E. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5959-5963Google Scholar, 53Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Google Scholar). The protofibrils are intermediate structures in the protein fibrillogenesis, exhibited by many proteins, and assume different shapes (spherical, annular, and chain protofibrils) often with lengths extending up to 200 nm and 1–10 nm in diameter (8Serpell L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Google Scholar, 47Chamberlain A.K. MacPhee C.E. Zurdo J. Morozova-Roche L.A. Hill H.A. Dobson C.M. Davis J.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 3282-3293Google Scholar, 54Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Google Scholar). Mature fibrils are formed by the association of protofibrils or by further growth of protofibrils by the attachment of monomeric molecules (48Fink A.L. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: R9-R23Google Scholar, 55Teplow D.B. Amyloid. 1998; 5: 121-142Google Scholar). The initial lag phase, the time required to form the nucleation centers, and the propagation phase that leads to the formation of the protofibrils, were affected by the interaction with polyamines. Work on the development of a kinetic scheme incorporating both amorphous and fibrillar aggregates is in progress. The increase in thio T fluorescence and the CD spectral changes corresponding to the transition to the β-sheet secondary conformation occurred simultaneously during α-synuclein aggregation in the absence and presence of putrescine. However, it was unclear from CD spectra whether the aggregates formed in the presence of spermidine or spermine at high concentration possessed a β-sheet structure. The development of turbidity in the sample, and the decrease in CD signal intensity were indicative of precipitation of the protein. Fibrillar structures were seen by SFM as early as 4 h, in the presence of high concentrations of polyamines (Fig. 5, B and C). Examination by EM of the samples obtained under similar conditions after 6 h revealed a significant fraction of aggregates corresponding to that of protofibrils (Fig. 4, B andC). Only larger sized fibrils were present after 3 days of incubation, implying that most of the protofibrils aggregated into mature fibrils. However, the thio T fluorescence did not increase after 8–10 h of incubation, revealing that the transition from protofibrils to fibrils was not associated with structural changes leading to additional thio T binding. A logical conclusion is that the fibrils probably formed by association of protofibrils. Alternatively, the rapid aggregation at high polyamine concentration may reflect the formation of insoluble small amorphous aggregates and the corresponding turbidity at early time points (8 h) as observed for α-synuclein incubated with 100 μm spermine (Fig. 3 C). Upon further incubation (24 h), a substantial fraction of the protein adopts a more soluble β-sheet conformation, giving rise to the characteristic CD spectra. In the case of the amyloid Aβ aggregation, the conversion of amorphous to fibrillar structures and the generation of nucleation sites from amorphous aggregates for the formation of structured fibrils by addition of monomeric Aβ have been proposed (56Huang T.H. Yang D.S. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36436-36440Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and SFM revealed differences in the α-synuclein aggregates formed in the presence or absence of polyamines. In the EM images, the fibrils of α-synuclein formed in the absence of polyamines were evenly distributed on the surface of carbon films, forming networks of individual fibrils, many of which were twisted (Fig. 4). In contrast, the polyamine-mediated aggregates comprised a multitude of fibrils, containing many filaments assembled as large aggregates. The aggregate morphology may be important in toxicity as shown for α-synuclein (13Kim Y.S. Lee D. Lee E.K. Sung J.Y. Chung K.C. Kim J. Paik S.R. Brain Res. 2001; 908: 93-98Google Scholar) and other amyloid aggregates (57Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddel N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M.

Martinez E. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 304: 107-111Google Scholar), although the activities of ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine/spermidine acetyl transferase, the key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of polyamines, increase significantly (39Morrison L.D. Cao X.C. Kish S.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 288-294Google Scholar, 60Morrison L.D. Kish S.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 197: 5-8Google Scholar). Polyamines are scavengers for free radicals and protect cells from free radical-induced oxidative damage, a process that promotes aggregation of α-synuclein (21Butterfield D.A. Kanski J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2001; 122: 945-962Google Scholar, 61Gerlach M. Desser H. Youdim M.B. Riederer P. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 1996; 48: 7-21Google Scholar). Paradoxically, our observation that the polyamines accelerate aggregation suggests that they may also facilitate neurodegeneration. A similar effect has been reported for dopamine, which promotes the formation of α-synuclein protofibrils, considered by some (27Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Google Scholar) to be more neurotoxic than the mature fibrils. In contrast, Levadopa, the precursor of dopamine, is a major drug used against PD (62Ahlskog J.E. Neurol. Clin. 2001; 19: 579-605Google Scholar). An intriguing possibility is that a balance is maintained between the cell protective and degenerative functions of these molecules. This balance would be disrupted upon degeneration by the failure or dysfunction of regulatory mechanisms such as the degradation of aggregates or binding of α-synuclein to membranes, a state stabilizing the protein in an α-helical structure (63Jo E. McLaurin J. Yip C.M., St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34328-34334Google Scholar). We have demonstrated in this study that small molecules like polyamines can modulate the kinetics of fibrillization of α-synuclein. This finding may be important for the development of more efficient bioassays and the identification of drug candidates that inhibit, delay, or reverse aggregation. More fundamental is the possibility that these ubiquitous cations are directly involved in the development of Parkinson's disease."

The NMR structure of the complex reveals a novel recognition mechanism—the WIP ligand, which is far longer than canonical EVH1 ligands, wraps around the domain, contacting a narrow but extended surface. This recognition mechanism provides a basis for understanding the effects of mutations that cause WAS."
https://openalex.org/W2008858433,"Eight human liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells as fusion proteins carrying a short C-terminal extension that ends with 6 histidine residues (His tag). The activity of recombinant UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 was almost fully inhibited by 0.2% Triton X-100. In the case of UGT1A9, however, glucuronidation of α-naphthol and scopoletin was resistant to such inhibition, whereas glucuronidation of entacapone and several other aglycones was sensitive. His-tagged UGT1A9 was purified by immobilized metal-chelating chromatography (IMAC). Purified UGT1A9 glucuronidated scopoletin at a high rate, whereas its glucuronidation activity toward entacapone was low and largely dependent on phospholipid addition. Recombinant UGT1A9 in which the His tag was replaced by hemagglutinin antigenic peptide (HA tag) was also prepared. Insect cells were co-infected with baculoviruses encoding both HA-tagged and His-tagged UGT1A9. Membranes from the co-infected cells, or a mixture of membranes from separately infected cells, were subjected to detergent extraction and IMAC, and the resulting fractions were analyzed for the presence of each type of UGT1A9 using tag-specific antibodies. In the case of separate infection, the HA-tagged UGT1A9 did not bind to the column. When co-infected with His-tagged UGT1A9, however, part of the HA-tagged enzyme was bound to the column and was eluted by imidazole concentration gradient together with the His-tagged UGT1A9, suggesting the formation of stable dimers that contain one His-tagged and one HA-tagged UGT1A9 monomers. Eight human liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells as fusion proteins carrying a short C-terminal extension that ends with 6 histidine residues (His tag). The activity of recombinant UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 was almost fully inhibited by 0.2% Triton X-100. In the case of UGT1A9, however, glucuronidation of α-naphthol and scopoletin was resistant to such inhibition, whereas glucuronidation of entacapone and several other aglycones was sensitive. His-tagged UGT1A9 was purified by immobilized metal-chelating chromatography (IMAC). Purified UGT1A9 glucuronidated scopoletin at a high rate, whereas its glucuronidation activity toward entacapone was low and largely dependent on phospholipid addition. Recombinant UGT1A9 in which the His tag was replaced by hemagglutinin antigenic peptide (HA tag) was also prepared. Insect cells were co-infected with baculoviruses encoding both HA-tagged and His-tagged UGT1A9. Membranes from the co-infected cells, or a mixture of membranes from separately infected cells, were subjected to detergent extraction and IMAC, and the resulting fractions were analyzed for the presence of each type of UGT1A9 using tag-specific antibodies. In the case of separate infection, the HA-tagged UGT1A9 did not bind to the column. When co-infected with His-tagged UGT1A9, however, part of the HA-tagged enzyme was bound to the column and was eluted by imidazole concentration gradient together with the His-tagged UGT1A9, suggesting the formation of stable dimers that contain one His-tagged and one HA-tagged UGT1A9 monomers. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases critical micellar concentration hemagglutinin antigenic peptide immobilized metal-chelating chromatography UDP-glucuronic acid 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)1 are a family of membrane-bound proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum that play an important role in the biotransformation of a large number of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds (for reviews see Refs. 1Burchell B.

The UGTs catalyze glucuronic acid transfer from UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GA) to acceptor compounds, aglycones, that are mostly lipophilic and rather small molecules. Glucuronidation renders the aglycone more water-soluble and facilitates its excretion from the body. Mutations that lead to low expression level or weak activity of UGT1A1 result in poor bilirubin glucuronidation and subsequent development of Crigler-Najjar or Gilbert's Syndromes (6Kadakol A.

Ethell B. Toxicol. Lett. 2000; 113: 333-340Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mutations in UGT1A7 were suggested to increase the risk of colorectal cancer development (8Strassburg C.P. Vogel A. Kneip S. Tukey R.H. Manns M.P. Gut. 2002; 50: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas UGT1A9 was shown to play an important role in the metabolism of certain carcinogenic amines (9Yueh M.-F. Nguyen N. Famourzadeh M. Strassburg C.P. Oda Y. Guengerich F.P. Tukey R.H. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition to xenobiotics, UGTs of the 2B subfamily glucuronidate steroid hormones and bile salts, all of which may have important clinical implications. Hence, gaining deeper insight into the detoxification of carcinogens and metabolism of drugs and several endogenous compounds requires better understanding of the structure and function of UGTs. The human genome contains many UGT genes (including some pseudogenes), most of which are grouped into two main subfamilies, UGT1A and UGT2B. The proteins are made of two large domains, a variable N-terminal half that is encoded by exon 1 of the respected genes, and a highly conserved C-terminal half that is encoded by exons 2–5. Due to exon sharing the C-terminal domain is identical in all the UGTs of the 1A subfamily. The C-terminal halves of the UGT2B enzymes are almost, but not fully, identical to each other, and they are also very similar to that of the UGT1A enzymes. Because all the UGTs employ UDP-GA as the sugar donor, the identity/similarity of the C-terminal half, as well as some experimental evidence, suggests that this domain harbors the UDP-GA-binding site (10Pillot T. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Lafaurie C. Tebbi D. Treat S. Radominska A. Lester R. Siest G. Magdalou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Dispos. 1998; 26: 812-817PubMed Google Scholar). The sugar acceptor specificity may thus be determined primarily by the structure of the N-terminal half (12Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3432-3435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aglycone specificity does vary among the individual UGTs, but large overlaps among them in this respect are well documented (e.g. Ref. 4Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 581-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar and references therein). Furthermore, each UGT can glucuronidate more than one substrate, a promiscuity that may be typical of detoxifying enzymes. Many UGTs are expressed in the liver, and in combination with partial overlapping in substrate specificity and substrate promiscuity, this means that the characterization of individual UGT activities in the native membrane is a very difficult task. The use of recombinant enzymes has thus become a common practice in the field, particularly when testing which UGT isoform glucuronidates a specific substrate of interest (e.g. Refs.1Burchell B. Brierley C.H. Rance D. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The UGTs are bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane so that most of their mass is located on the lumenal side of the membrane. A short trans-membrane segment is present close to the C-terminal of these 50–60-kDa proteins, and the last 20–22 amino acids are exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (2Meech R. Mackenzie P.I. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1997; 24: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Radominska-Pandya A. Czernik P.J. Little J.M. Battaglia E. Mackenzie P.I. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 817-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The single trans-membrane segment is not, however, the only way by which the enzymes bind to the membrane. Recombinant UGTs that carry a stop codon before the beginning of the trans-membrane segment were reported still to be bound to the membrane but to be catalytically inactive (16Meech R. Mackenzie P.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Ouzzine M. Magdalou J. Burchell B. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31401-31409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast to the latter inactivation, however, truncation of UGT2B1 downstream from the trans-membrane segment did not abolish enzyme activity, indicating that the cytoplasmic “tail” is not essential for glucuronic acid transfer (16Meech R. Mackenzie P.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Questions about whether or not the UGTs exist as dimers, either homo- or heterodimers, and what the implications of such arrangements might be have often been raised (18Koiwai O. Aono S. Adachi Y. Kamisako T. Yasui Y. Nishizawa M. Sato H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Meech R. Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol.

It was recently suggested that heterodimers including the guinea pig enzymes UGT2B21 and UGT2B22 might exhibit activity that is either weaker or even undetectable when either of the two participating UGTs is expressed alone (22Ishii Y. Miyoshi A. Watanabe R. Tsuruda K. Tsuda M. Yamaguchi-Nagamatsu Y. Yoshisue K. Tanaka M. Maji D. Ohgiya S. Oguri K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1040-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was reported that UGT1A1 forms homodimers and not heterodimers and that dimers that contain one native and one mutant monomer are partly or completely inactive (23Ghosh S.S. Sappal B.S. Kalpana G.V. Lee S.W. Chowdhury J.R. Chowdhury N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42108-42115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, determination of the oligomeric state of human UGTs, either recombinant or in the native membrane, is not an easy task because of the absence of a good purification procedure that would yield sufficient amount of the pure and active enzyme. If an inactive enzyme turns out to be monomeric, it may be claimed that monomerization during the purification was the cause of activity loss; and if it is found to be oligomeric, then it may be argued that the enzyme aggregated during purification. We have prepared a battery of recombinant human liver UGTs that were expressed as fusion proteins with a C-terminal His tag. Among these UGTs, the activity of UGT1A9 is exceptional in its resistance to inhibition by high concentration of several detergents, at least when glucuronidation of some aglycones is concerned. In addition, our results indicate that the recombinant human UGT1A9 is a stable homodimeric enzyme. α-Naphthol, 4-methylumbelliferone,p-nitrophenol, saccharolactone, scopoletin, umbelliferone, UDP-GA, α-naphthyl-β-d-glucuronide, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide, andp-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucuronide were purchased from Sigma, and 7-hydroxycoumarin glucuronide was from UFC. Radiolabeled [14C]UDP-GA was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Entacapone was kindly provided by Orion Pharma (Espoo, Finland), and entacapone glucuronide was synthesized in our laboratory (24Luukkanen L. Kilpelainen I. Kangas H. Ottoila P. Elovaara E. Taskinen J. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999; 10: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 was purchased from BDH; dodecyl maltoside was from Anatrace, and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine type X-E) were from Sigma. The human UGTs 1A6 and 1A9 were previously cloned and expressed in our laboratory (25Forsman T. Lautala P. Lundström K. Monastyrskaia K. Ouzzine M. Burchell B. Taskinen J. Ulmanen I. Life Sci. 2000; 67: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Complementary DNAs corresponding to 1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B4, 2B7, and 2B15 were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total liver RNA (Invitrogen) as template, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Sigma) for the first strand DNA synthesis, and eitherTaq DNA polymerase (Fermentas), Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), or Herculase blend (Stratagene) for the amplification. Gene-specific oligonucleotides were used in each case (sequences are available upon request). The amplified genes were subcloned into a suitable vector, pGem-T-Easy (Promega) or pUC19, and subjected to a second round of PCR, in which a BamHI site was introduced a few nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation point (the first ATG) and a SalI site immediately upstream from the stop codon. The BamHI-SalI fragment from each cloned UGT was then subcloned into pFastBac derivatives (Fig. 1) containing a short linker encoding an enterokinase cleavage site, 6 His residues, and a stop codon that were inserted into the original plasmid (Invitrogen). The UGTs of the 1A family were subcloned into pFBXHC and the members of the 2B family into pFBXHA. The cloned genes were sequenced within this construct before the generation of recombinant baculovirus. The latter was performed by transposition within Escherichia coli DH10Bac cells, selection of correct colonies, purification of bacmid DNA, and transformation of the SF9 insect cells using the Cellfectin reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For protein production the cells were cultured in suspension in SF900 II medium that was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The optimal infection size for each viral stock was determined by infecting several 5-ml cell suspensions (2 × 106 cells/ml) in 100-ml flasks with different amounts of virus from a given stock, and by assaying activity in the cells that were collected 45–48 h post-infection. Protein production of the different recombinant UGTs was normally initiated by infecting 40–60 ml of cell suspension in a 250-ml flask with the optimal amount of virus from the specific stock and culturing at 27 °C for 45–48 h at 120 rpm. The cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C for up to 2 months. Cells were thawed and suspended in about 1 ml of washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA) per 40 ml of original culture volume and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,700 × g. The pellets were suspended in cold H2O for osmotic lysis so that cells originating from about 80 ml of initial culture volume were eventually mixed with 80 ml of cold H2O. The suspension was stirred for 10 min and centrifuged at 41,000 × g for 2 h. Finally, if the membranes were designated for activity assays, the pellets were suspended in a small amount of buffer, homogenized using a glass Potter homogenizer, divided into aliquots, and stored at −70 °C until use. In case the membranes were designated for enzyme purification, the pellets were suspended in salt-containing and EDTA-free buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl), centrifuged once more as described above, and stored at −20 °C. Assay mixtures contained 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm saccharolactone, 5 mm UDP-GA, 0.15–0.35 mg/ml protein of the membranes containing the appropriate recombinant UGT, or 0.1 mg/ml pooled human liver microsomes (Gentest), and 500 μm aglycone substrate, unless stated otherwise (e.g. Figs. 2 and 5). The detergent tolerance tests were performed at concentrations above the critical micellar concentrations depending on the detergent tested. The concentration of sonicated phospholipids in assays of the purified UGT1A9, when added, was 1 mg/ml. All the UGT activity assays were performed at 37 °C and the reaction time varied, within a linear range, from 15 to 60 min. The reactions were terminated, and the proteins were precipitated by an addition of cold perchloric acid to a final concentration of 365 mm and chilling in an ice bath for 10 min, followed by 5 min of centrifugation at 15,700 × g. Aliquots of the supernatants were analyzed using model 1100 high pressure liquid chromatography (Agilent) under the conditions described in TableI.Figure 5Stimulation of enzymatic activities of purified UGT1A9 by added phospholipids. The scopoletin (A) and entacapone (B) glucuronidation activities were assayed either without added phospholipids (dark shade,no addition), or in the presence of 1 mg/ml phospholipids (light shade,+phospholipids).

Membranes were thawed and suspended in extraction medium (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) at about 1–2 mg of protein/ml. The suspension was mixed for 10 min and centrifuged at 41,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter to remove the remaining particles and loaded onto a nickel-charged His Hi-trap column attached to an ÄKTA prime machine (Amersham Biosciences) that has been pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0,05% Triton X-100, 50 mm imidazole). After extensive washing the bound protein was eluted by imidazole gradient, 50–400 mm, in the presence of NaCl and Triton X-100. The collected fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and selected fractions were pooled and concentrated using Centriplus YM30 filter device (Millipore). Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and transferred to PROTRAN 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) in the Mini PROTEAN 3 apparatus (Bio-Rad). His-tagged recombinant UGTs were detected using Tetra-His monoclonal antibodies (Qiagen) and HA-tagged UGT1A9 with the HA.11 monoclonal antibodies (Covance). The second antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent system (Pierce) was employed for visualization. Protein concentrations were measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) system (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. N-terminal sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 477A/120A automated sequencer, in the gas phase mode (27Baumann M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), following the procedure supplied by the manufacturer. Eight different human UGTs, 1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B4, 2B7, and 2B15 were cloned and expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells as His-tagged proteins. The recombinant enzymes also contain an enterokinase cleavage site (Fig. 1), but due to the good specific activity of the expressed UGTs, and the usefulness of the His tag for immunodetection, enterokinase treatment was omitted. The expression of the different UGTs was aimed at getting a high yield of the active enzyme rather than a high protein production. To this end activity assays in the presence of suitable substrates were used in order to optimize infection with each virus stock and to develop the isolation protocol of the membranes. The outcome of these experiments indicated that in most cases there is an optimal value for the infection size and that the post-infection culturing should be carried out for about 48 h. During the experiments to improve sample preparation methods, we have observed that sonication reduces total activity and that such a treatment to disrupt insect cells that were cultured in suspension is unnecessary. Freezing, thawing, and mild osmotic shock render the cells permeable for both UDP-GA and the aglycone substrates. In line with these observations a total membrane fraction, rather than microsomes, was used for the subsequent activity assays. It may be asked whether or not the recombinant UGTs function like their counterparts in the native tissue, particularly when they are slightly modified. Nevertheless, the overlap in substrate specificity among many of the UGTs, and the expression of all the UGTs that are examined in this work in the liver, renders comparison of the kinetic properties between most recombinant and native UGTs very difficult. In the case of UGT1A9, however, it is feasible to do such a comparison because entacapone, a selective substrate for this enzyme, is poorly glucuronidated by the other liver UGTs (28Lautala P. Ethell B.T. Taskinen J. Burchell B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 1385-1389PubMed Google Scholar). We have thus analyzed the rate of entacapone glucuronidation by human liver microsomes and the recombinant UGT1A9 that carries the C-terminal extension (Fig. 2). The similarity in specific activity between the two preparations is high, but this may partly be coincidental. Nevertheless, it is clear that the two different samples exhibit similar kinetics, including both the high affinity for entacapone as well as the substrate inhibition at high concentrations of the aglycone (Fig. 2). It can thus be concluded that the recombinant His-tagged UGT1A9 that was expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells is a good model for the native enzyme. The lack of a good method to purify individual UGTs in an active form was singled out as the major current hurdle in understanding their structure-function relationships (3Radominska-Pandya A. Czernik P.J. Little J.M. Battaglia E. Mackenzie P.I. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 817-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The recombinant UGTs described in this study carry His tags that should allow fast purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and are thus most suitable for the purification experiments. Being membrane proteins, purification of a UGT requires extraction by a detergent that does not inactivate the enzyme at concentrations above the critical micellar concentration (cmc) for the given detergent. We have tested the effects of 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside on the activity of recombinant UGTs. The effects of both detergents on the glucuronidation of α-naphthol and scopoletin by the different recombinant UGTs were very similar, and the Triton X-100 results are presented in TableII. In the case of both aglycones, UGT1A9 was the only enzyme that is not merely resistant to the detergent-induced inhibition but even stimulated by such treatments. Recombinant UGT1A4 was not tested in these experiments because it does not glucuronidate scopoletin or α-naphthol at measurable rates (not shown). The glucuronidation of 4-aminobiphenyl by recombinant UGT1A4 was, however, almost fully inhibited by Triton X-100.Table IIEffect of Triton X-100 (0.2%, w/v) on the activities of different recombinant UGTsUGTAglycone2-aThe aglycones and UDP-GA concentrations were 0.5 and 5 mm, respectively.Activity% remaining activityNo detergent+Triton X-100pmol·mg −1 ·min −11A1α-Naphthol619.602-bActivity was below detection limit and considered to be nil.0.01A1Scopoletin783.714.01.81A3Scopoletin243.63.31.41A6α-Naphthol2568.99.60.41A6Scopoletin876.50.40.051A9α-Naphthol137.0181.3132.31A9Scopoletin149.8198.7132.72B4α-Naphthol64.33.35.12B7α-Naphthol405.34.91.22B7Scopoletin123.00.50.42B15α-Naphthol30.902-bActivity was below detection limit and considered to be nil.0.02B15Scopoletin6.30.46.3The detergent was added to samples containing the respective membrane-bound UGT just before the onset of the reaction.2-a The aglycones and UDP-GA concentrations were 0.5 and 5 mm, respectively.2-b Activity was below detection limit and considered to be nil. Open table in a new tab The detergent was added to samples containing the respective membrane-bound UGT just before the onset of the reaction. The detergent effects in the inhibition experiments were rather rapid (Tables II and III, and data in the text below), because the detergents were added to the reaction mixture that already contained membranes, and neither preincubation nor centrifugation were performed before the initiation of the enzymatic reactions by substrate addition. The aglycone substrates selected for the initial experiments were α-naphthol and scopoletin because they allow a parallel examination of the different UGTs. The results were somewhat surprising and similar for both the substrates, i.e. UGT1A9 is the only enzyme that is not severely inhibited by Triton X-100 (Table II). The observed detergent-induced stimulation of UGT1A9 activity (Table II) can probably be attributed to membrane disruption that makes previously sealed vesicles fully permeable to UDP-GA. Not every detergent, however, stimulates UGT1A9 activity. The glucuronidation activity of α-naphthol by the membrane-bound UGT1A9 in the presence of 1% (w/v) CHAPS and sodium cholate was about 35 and less than 5%, respectively, of the control rate (no added detergent), and the glucuronidation of scopoletin was almost totally inhibited by 50 mm octyl glucoside.Table IIIEffect of Triton X-100 (0.2%, w/v) on the glucuronidation of different aglycones by recombinant UGT1A9Detergent addition to samples containing membrane-bound UGT1A9 was done just before the onset of the reaction.

Open table in a new tab Detergent addition to samples containing membrane-bound UGT1A9 was done just before the onset of the reaction. The inhibition by detergent addition, where indicated, was almost total. The finding that glucuronidation of scopoletin and α-naphthol by UGT1A9 is not inhibited by Triton X-100 (Table II) was initially believed to suggest that the resistance to detergent inhibition arises solely from the protein structure. However, it soon turned out that this resistance is also dependent on the properties of the aglycone, because the glucuronidation of entacapone by recombinant UGT1A9 was almost fully inhibited by Triton X-100 at a concentration that did not inhibit the glucuronidation of scopoletin and α-naphthol (not shown).

On the other hand, activated host defense cells undergoing the oxidative burst show increased vitamin C accumulation. We analyzed the role of the oxidative burst and the glucose transporters on vitamin C recycling in an in vitro system consisting of activated host-defense cells co-cultured with human cell lines and primary cells. We asked whether human cells can acquire vitamin C by a “bystander effect” by taking up dehydroascorbic acid generated from extracellular ascorbic acid by neighboring cells undergoing the oxidative burst. As activated cells, we used HL-60 neutrophils and normal human neutrophils activated with phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate. As bystander cells, we used immortalized cell lines and primary cultures of human epithelial and endothelial cells. Activated cells produced superoxide anions that oxidized extracellular ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid. At the same time, there was a marked increase in vitamin C uptake by the bystander cells that was blocked by superoxide dismutase but not by catalase and was inhibited by the glucose transporter inhibitor cytochalasin B. Only ascorbic acid was accumulated intracellularly by the bystander cells. Glucose partially blocked vitamin C uptake by the bystander cells, although it increased superoxide production by the activated cells. We conclude that the local production of superoxide anions by activated cells causes the oxidation of extracellular ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid, which is then transported by neighboring cells through the glucose transporters and immediately reduced to ascorbic acid intracellularly. In addition to causing increased intracellular concentrations of ascorbic acid with likely associated enhanced antioxidant defense mechanisms, the bystander effect may allow the recycling of vitamin C in vivo, which may contribute to the low daily requirements of the vitamin in humans.

Although all cells express facilitative glucose transporters, the absolute specificity of these transporters for dehydroascorbic acid is in apparent contradiction to evidence indicating that vitamin C is present in human plasma only as ascorbic acid. Human host defense cells, however, have potent oxidative properties that are greatly enhanced by triggering of the oxidative burst, which leads to increased accumulation of vitamin C by the activated cells (15Vera J.C.

It is believed that the increased vitamin C uptake observed in the activated cells is caused by the oxidation of ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid, which is then rapidly transported intracellularly by the glucose transporters. An important implication of this concept is that the dehydroascorbic acid generated by cells secreting oxidants can be transported intracellularly by any cell present in the immediate area because glucose transporters are present in all cells and tissues. Thus, activated neutrophils participating in inflammatory reactions may provide other cell types with increased antioxidant protection. Using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)1-activated cells (HL-60 neutrophils and normal human neutrophils), we validated the concept that superoxide produced by activated cells does oxidize extracellular ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid. We used co-culture assays to demonstrate that human cells can acquire vitamin C by a “bystander effect,” taking up dehydroascorbic acid generated by superoxide anions produced by activated neighboring cells and subsequently accumulating ascorbic acid. We propose that the bystander effect may allow the cellular recycling of vitamin C by cells.

Strains of normal human mammary epithelial cells (normal breast cells) were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and were cultured using their media and supplements. Fresh normal human neutrophils were isolated by fractionation in Ficoll-Hypaque (15Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Golde D.W. Blood. 1998; 91: 2536-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained from umbilical cords by collagenase digestion, cultured in medium 199, and used within the first three passages (29Montecinos V.P. Aguayo C.

Discarded umbilical cords from full-term normal pregnancies were donated by the Regional Hospital in Concepción. Uptake assays were performed in incubation buffer (15 mmHepes pH 7.6, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2) containing 0.1 μCi of l-[14C]ascorbic acid (8.2 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 50 μm ascorbic acid.

When appropriate, enzymes and inhibitors were added to the uptake assays or the cells were preincubated with them. For the co-culture experiments, the adherent cells were grown in six-well plates until sub-confluent (2 × 105 cells/well). On the day of the experiment, the HL-60 neutrophils or freshly isolated normal human neutrophils were added to plates containing the adherent cells previously washed with incubation buffer, and PMA and radiolabeled ascorbic acid or dehydroascorbic acid were added to the wells for the uptake assays. After uptake, the supernatant was saved and the HL-60 neutrophils (or normal human neutrophils) were recovered by centrifugation and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The adherent cells were also washed, and both sets of samples were processed for scintillation counting (11Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velásquez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol.

For HPLC, the cells were lysed in a solution of 60% methanol-1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) at 4° C, and the extracts were stored at −70 °C. Samples containing vitamin C in solution were adjusted to 60% methanol and 1 mm EDTA and stored at −70 °C. HPLC analyses were performed using a Whatman strong anion exchange reverse-phase column (Partisil 10 SAX, 4.6 mm × 25 cm, 10-μm particle) (15Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Golde D.W. Blood. 1998; 91: 2536-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dehydroascorbic acid eluted at 4.6 min, and ascorbic acid eluted at 9.4 min. The elution of dehydroascorbic acid was monitored by radioactivity, whereas ascorbic acid was monitored by both radioactivity and absorbance at 266 nm. Production of superoxide was quantitated by monitoring the superoxide-dismutase inhibitable reduction of ferricytochromec. Cells were suspended in incubation buffer containing ferricytochrome c at 1 mg/ml and activated by the addition of PMA. The reduction of ferricytochrome c was monitored by determining the change in the absorbance at 550 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 21,000m−1·cm−1. Compared with untreated cells, HL-60 neutrophils treated with PMA and incubated with ascorbic acid showed a markedly increased uptake of vitamin C. At 60 min, PMA-treated cells showed a 60-fold increase in vitamin C accumulation (500 pmol/106cells) compared with control cells (8 pmol/106 cells) (Fig.1 A). Ten μmcytochalasin B, but not Cytochalasin E, blocked vitamin C uptake by the activated cells (Fig. 1 A). Superoxide dismutase blocked the uptake of vitamin C by the PMA-treated HL-60 neutrophils (Fig.1 A), whereas catalase had no effect (Fig. 1 A). Thus, the full effect of PMA on vitamin C uptake by the HL-60 neutrophils can be blocked by a specific inhibitor of the glucose transporters and an enzyme that dismutates superoxide anions. Consistent with the above observations, PMA-treated cells generated substantial amounts of superoxide anions. At 60 min, PMA-treated cells generated 19 pmol/106 cells compared with less than 0.5 pmol/106 cells in control cells (Fig. 1 B). Parallel experiments revealed that neither cytochalasin B nor E, at 10 μm, affected the production of superoxide by the activated cells (Fig. 1 B), thereby confirming the specificity of the inhibitory effect on the glucose transporter. Superoxide dismutase blocked the generation of superoxide by the PMA-treated HL-60 neutrophils, whereas catalase showed no effect (Fig.1 B). Thus, the full effect of PMA on vitamin C uptake by the HL-60 neutrophils can be directly linked to enhanced production of superoxide anions. When the HL-60 neutrophils were treated with PMA in buffers in which the NaCl was replaced with choline chloride, the rate of vitamin C uptake increased in a similar manner and approached a similar plateau in the presence or in the absence of sodium ions, and uptake was again specifically inhibited by cytochalasin B (data not shown). From the above data, we concluded that the PMA-activated HL-60 neutrophils directly transport locally generated dehydroascorbic acid through the glucose transporters. We used HPLC to directly verify the generation of dehydroascorbic acid by the activated HL-60 neutrophils. Treatment of HL-60 neutrophils with PMA resulted in the time-dependent oxidation of extracellular ascorbic acid (Fig. 1 C). At 60 min, ∼40% of the radioactivity eluted in the position corresponding to ascorbic acid, compared with greater than 95% in control samples treated with superoxide dismutase. These experiments revealed the time-dependent generation of two radioactive peaks, a first one eluting at 4.6 min and corresponding to dehydroascorbic acid, and a second one eluting at 11 min, which corresponded to dehydroascorbic acid hydrolysis products (data not shown). We estimated the total amount of dehydroascorbic acid generated in the presence of PMA-treated cells as the sum of the material contained in the HPLC peaks eluting at 4.6 and 11 min, which revealed that more than 60% of the original ascorbic acid present in solution was oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid in 60 min (Fig.1 C). We tested the validity of the “bystander effect” concept in an in vitro model consisting of activated HL-60 neutrophils co-cultured with the human prostate cancer cells DU-145 (the bystander cells). The prostate cells grow in monolayers and adhere to the culture plates and therefore are easily separated from the HL-60 neutrophils that grow in suspension, permitting the determination of the content of vitamin C in each cell type separately. There was some uptake of vitamin C in untreated prostate cells incubated alone, probably because of the presence of low levels of dehydroascorbic acid in the sample of ascorbic acid, and that uptake was not increased by treatment with PMA (Fig.2 A). On the other hand, DU-145 cells incubated in the presence of activated HL-60 neutrophils showed increased uptake of vitamin C (Fig. 2 A). At 60 min, they contained 6 nmol of vitamin C per million cells, an amount 15-fold higher than that accumulated by PMA-treated prostate cells incubated alone. Parallel experiments revealed a similar time-dependent production of superoxide anions (rate: 0.17 nmol/106 HL-60 neutrophils × min) by co-cultures of PMA-treated HL-60 neutrophils and prostate tumor cells compared with cultures of PMA-treated HL-60 neutrophils alone (Fig. 2 B). The DU-145 cells did not produce superoxide anions when cultured under similar conditions (Fig. 2 B). Experiments in which a fixed number of DU-145 cells were co-cultured with variable numbers of HL-60 neutrophils revealed increased uptake of vitamin C by the DU-145 cells as the number of HL-60 neutrophils present in the assay increased (Fig. 2 C). There was a 13-fold increase in vitamin C uptake, from 0.4 to 5.2 nmol per million prostate cells when the number of HL-60 neutrophils in the assay was increased from 0.1 to 5 million cells, but no further increase in uptake was observed when the HL-60 neutrophils were increased up to 30 million per assay. Parallel experiments revealed a similar correlation between the number of activated HL-60 neutrophils added to the co-culture assay and the amount of superoxide anions generated (Fig.2 D). Superoxide dismutase abolished at least 75% of vitamin C uptake by the DU-145 cells co-cultured with activated HL-60 neutrophils, indicating that superoxide is central to vitamin C uptake by the bystander cells (Fig. 2 E). Moreover, cytochalasin B, but not cytochalasin E, inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the uptake of vitamin C by the DU-145 cells co-cultured with activated HL-60 neutrophils, with greater than 95% inhibition observed at 10 μm cytochalasin B (Fig. 2 E). Replacing the NaCl in the medium with choline chloride failed to affect the uptake of vitamin C by the DU-145 cells (data not shown). Both the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin B and the sodium independence of the overall uptake process are consistent with the bystander cells taking up dehydroascorbic acid through glucose transporters. It is therefore possible that the capacity of the DU-145 cells to take up dehydroascorbic acid could be subjected to regulation by the co-culture with HL-60 neutrophils or by activation with PMA. Short uptake experiments revealed that DU-145 cells cultured alone, in the absence of PMA, transported dehydroascorbic acid at a rate of 0.83 nmol/106 cells × min, rate was unchanged in cells treated with PMA and also in cells co-cultured with HL-60 cells with or without PMA (data not shown), indicating that the capacity of the DU-145 cells to transport dehydroascorbic acid was not affected by PMA or the co-culture with HL-60 neutrophils. Long uptake studies to measure accumulation of vitamin C revealed that for all conditions tested, uptake increased in a linear manner for the first 30 min of incubation, with an average uptake rate of 0.55 nmol/106 cells × min and approached saturation at about 60 min (data not shown). Thus, PMA treatment or co-culture with the HL-60 cells did not affect the accumulation of vitamin C by the DU-145 cells. We next identified the chemical form of vitamin C accumulated intracellularly by the DU-145 cells. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of only ascorbic acid accumulated intracellularly, with more than 97% of the radioactivity accumulated by the cells eluting in the position of ascorbic acid (data not shown). We conclude that human prostate tumor cells transport the dehydroascorbic acid that is generated by locally activated cells through the glucose transporters and subsequently accumulate ascorbic acid intracellularly. We tested the general applicability of the bystander effect by co-culturing activated HL-60 neutrophils with a number of human primary cells and cell lines. This group of cells included normal mammary epithelial cells and the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-468. These cells do not express functional ascorbic acid transporters and take up dehydroascorbic acid through glucose transporters (data not shown). When incubated in the presence of activated HL-60 neutrophils, the breast cells showed increased uptake of vitamin C; at 60 min, they contained an amount of vitamin C that was 6- to 20-fold higher than that accumulated by PMA-treated cells incubated alone (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, cytochalasin B, but not cytochalasin E, completely blocked the uptake of vitamin C by the co-cultured bystander cells, with greater than 90% inhibition observed at 10 μmcytochalasin B (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). The bystander effect was also observed when PMA-activated fresh human neutrophils were co-cultured with the human endothelial-like cell line ECV304, the human melanoma cell line GMEL, or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Fig. 3 B). These cells express both ascorbic acid and glucose transporters and therefore transport both oxidized and reduced vitamin C (Ref. 27Spielholz C. Golde D.W. Houghton A.N. Nualart F. Vera J.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2529-2537PubMed Google Scholar, and data not shown). With both cell lines, there was a marked increase in the uptake of vitamin C by the bystander cells, an increase that was blocked by cytochalsin B (Fig.3 B). The fraction of uptake that was not blocked by cytochalasin B was absent when the cells were incubated in medium lacking sodium ions (data not shown) and therefore corresponds to transport of ascorbic acid through sodium-ascorbate cotransporters. Because the bystander effects involves the transport of locally generated dehydroascorbic acid through facilitative glucose transporters, we tested whether glucose, at concentrations within the expected ranges found in vivo, could block the bystander effect by directly competing for the glucose transporters. These experiments revealed that 15 mm glucose decreased by less than 40% the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid by the bystander cells (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the bystander effect occurs efficiently in the presence of physiological concentrations of glucose. This less-than-expected effect of glucose on vitamin C uptake can be explained by the observation that glucose increases the production of superoxide anions by the activated cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal activation of near 100% at 15 mm glucose (Fig. 3 D). The capacity of human neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes to generate oxidants has been widely documented (19Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30McPhail L.C. Strum S.L. Leone P.A. Sozzani S. Coffey R.G. Granulocyte Response toCcytokines. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY1992: 47-76Google Scholar), and these cells accumulate increased amounts of ascorbic acid when incubated under conditions that lead to the activation of the oxidative burst (15Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Golde D.W. Blood. 1998; 91: 2536-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Washko P.W. Wang Y.H. Levine M. J. Biol.

The data have been previously analyzed in the context of the recycling of vitamin C by activated cells, and based on the evidence that the glucose transporters are highly efficient transporters of dehydroascorbic acid, it has been suggested that the increased uptake probably represents the transport of locally generated dehydroascorbic acid (15Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Golde D.W. Blood. 1998; 91: 2536-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Laggner H. Goldenberg H. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The detailed analysis presented here is consistent with this interpretation and furthermore, we argue for a more general role of the oxidative burst in modulating vitamin C availability. Our central proposal is that the dehydroascorbic acid generated by activated cells producing superoxide can be transported by other cells present in the immediate area. We tested this hypothesis using an experimental system consisting of activated cells (HL-60 neutrophils and normal human neutrophils) co-cultured with adherent cells (bystander cells). The co-culture experiments confirmed that activated cells are able to provide vitamin C, as dehydroascorbic acid, to adjacent bystander cells by oxidizing ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid, which is then taken up by the adjacent cells and immediately reduced back to ascorbic acid intracellularly. The triggering of the oxidative burst has been classically linked to the physiological mechanism of host defense that has as its central purpose the elimination of microorganisms by strong oxidants generated by cells of the host defense system (30McPhail L.C. Strum S.L. Leone P.A. Sozzani S. Coffey R.G. Granulocyte Response toCcytokines. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY1992: 47-76Google Scholar). Our present findings indicate that the oxidative burst leads not only to increased accumulation of vitamin C by the activated cells but also by neighboring cells via a novel bystander effect. Because of the ubiquitous expression of glucose transporters, all cells have potentially the capacity to acquire vitamin C through the bystander mechanism described here. Thus, our present findings add an additional level of complexity to previous interpretations by revealing a certain balance between oxidative and anti-oxidative actions in inflammatory reactions whereby extracellular oxidation itself causes increased intracellular concentrations of ascorbic acid. The importance of this concept lies in the fact that oxidants produced by activated phagocytes to kill microorganisms also damage adjacent tissues and cells. Similarly, oxidant damage to tissues resulting from autoimmune reactions is due in part to host defense cell activation. On the other hand, the antioxidative properties of vitamin C make it likely that an increased intracellular content of vitamin C in the adjacent bystander cells enhances their antioxidant defense mechanisms. Thus, the bystander effect links antioxidant cellular defense with extracellular oxidation. Our data directly address the apparent paradox that although all human cells have the capacity to transport oxidized vitamin C, dehydroascorbic acid represents a very small fraction of total ascorbate in vivo (2Rose R.C.

Moreover, in vitrotransport studies with isolated cells have revealed the existence of sodium-ascorbic acid co-transporters in a number of cells of animal origin (4Diliberto Jr., E.J. Heckman G.D.

Two isoforms with the expected properties for sodium-ascorbic acid co-transporters were recently cloned from rat and human RNA, and Northern and in situhybridization analysis revealed the presence of the mRNA in small intestine, liver, kidney, adrenal glands, brain, retina, and other tissues (35Tsukaguchi H.

Using in vitro transport assays under strictly controlled conditions to avoid the uncontrolled oxidation of ascorbic acid, we have shown absence of functional ascorbic acid transporters in a number of cells of human origin (10Vera J.C.

Blood. 1998; 91: 2536-2546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently extended this analysis to normal and neoplastic cells and cells lines derived from human prostate and breast (this study) 2C. I. Rivas, F. J. Nualart, and J. C. Vera, unpublished results. and found that they transport dehydroascorbic acid efficiently through facilitative glucose transporters. Furthermore, our studies in vivosuggest that oxidized vitamin C may cross the blood-brain barrier (16Agus D.B. Gambhir S.S. Pardridge W.M. Spielholz C. Baselga J. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Why, then, if all human cells express dehydroascorbic acid transporters, is there no detectable dehydroascorbic acid in blood? We reason that this may be related to the chemical properties of the different forms of vitamin C. Although ascorbic acid appears to be stable in vivo, in solution dehydroascorbic acid undergoes hydrolysis with an estimated half-life of less than 1 min (10Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Winkler B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 39Bode A.M.

The hydrolysis is an irreversible process, which if it where to occurin vivo, would imply a vast consumption of vitamin C. This is an issue of physiological significance because humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C and must obtain the vitamin from external sources in the diet. The absence of vitamin C in the diet leads to the development of scurvy with its associated problems and ultimately death. Although there has been some controversy regarding the definition of the optimal daily requirements of vitamin C in humans in exact physiological terms (42Young V.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14344-14348Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43Carr A.C. Frei B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 69: 1086-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), it is clear that small daily amounts of vitamin C in the diet are sufficient for the maintenance of a “normal” human physiology. It is therefore evident that the salvage of vitamin C in vivo through continuous recycling could be central to the maintenance of low daily requirements of the vitamin. This is an issue that has been addressed in the case of the recycling of vitamin C by human erythrocytes and its effect on the antioxidant reserve of whole blood (44May J.M. Qu Z.C. Whitesell R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12721-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 45Mendiratta S. Qu Z.C. May J.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Our present data extend these previous observations by indicating that the dehydroascorbic acid generated locally by oxidation of ascorbic acid can be immediately transported intracellularly and reduced back to ascorbic acid by neighboring cells. Moreover, our in vitro data indicate that the bystander effect is operative in the presence of physiological concentrations of glucose, and we have preliminary evidence indicating that the bystander effect may be functional in vivo (46Agus D.B. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4555-4558PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the bystander effect may provide cells with an efficient system for the recycling and salvage of vitamin C. Although the study presented here refers to human cells, its conclusions are generally applicable to cells that express glucose transporters and are involved in oxidative events of the kind described here. A mechanism for the acquisition of vitamin C based in the local oxidation of ascorbic acid is not necessarily restricted to cells of the host defense system. Although the NADPH oxidase of phagocytes has been the most thoroughly studied, there is evidence indicating that non-phagocytic human cells express a membrane oxidase with the capacity to generate superoxide. Endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, retinal epithelial cells, and fibroblasts generate low levels of superoxide, and the activity of the oxidases expressed in these cells is regulated in a cell-dependent manner by growth factors and other cell-specific stimuli (47Jones S.A.

A. 1997; 94: 14483-14488Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the generation of superoxide by non-phagocytic cells may be central to the delivery of signals important for cell function. Based on the results presented here, we propose that the NADPH oxidase present in non-phagocyte cells may play a role in regulating not only their own cellular uptake of vitamin C, but may also potentially modulate the uptake of vitamin C in other cells. Our data may provide useful insights into the underlying role of vitamin C deficiency in human disease. Patients with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus show an impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation that can be restored with vitamin C administration (50Ness A.R. Khaw K.T. Bingham S. Day N.E. J. Hypertens. 1996; 14: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that hyperglycemia may contribute to impaired vascular function through production of superoxide anions (51Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar). Moreover, diabetes and inflammatory disease are often accompanied by a decrease in plasma and intracellular ascorbate levels and by alterations in plasma ascorbate-dehydroascorbate ratios (52Sargeant L.A. Wareham N.J. Bingham S. Day N.E. Luben R.N. Oakes S. Welch A. Khaw K.T. Diabetes Care. 2000; 23: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this context, our data are compatible with the concept that hyperglycemia may lead to decreased intracellular regeneration of ascorbic acid because of irreversible loss of extracellular dehydroascorbic acid. In conclusion, we propose a model for vitamin C recycling that resolves the apparent contradiction that although dehydroascorbic acid is only a minor fraction of the total content of ascorbate in vivo, all human cells express dehydroascorbic acid transporters. In this model, superoxide generated by activated cells undergoing the oxidative burst oxidize extracellular ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid which is then transported through glucose transporters by the activated cells themselves as well as other cells present in the immediate area. The transported dehydroascorbic acid is immediately reduced back to ascorbic acid, which accumulates at high concentrations intracellularly. This recycling model may work as an efficient system for the salvage of vitamin C by avoiding the irreversible hydrolysis of the dehydroascorbic acid produced in inflammatory reactions. Moreover, it provides cells with increased intracellular concentrations of ascorbic acid with its associated antioxidant properties, therefore linking normal oxidative events to the regulation of antioxidant protection of cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2085161624,"We have proposed that hyperglycemia-induced dedifferentiation of β-cells is a critical factor for the loss of insulin secretory function in diabetes. Here we examined the effects of the duration of hyperglycemia on gene expression in islets of partially pancreatectomized (Px) rats. Islets were isolated, and mRNA was extracted from rats 4 and 14 weeks after Px or sham Px surgery. Px rats developed different degrees of hyperglycemia; low hyperglycemia was assigned to Px rats with fed blood glucose levels less than 150 mg/dl, and high hyperglycemia was assigned above 150 mg/dl. β-Cell hypertrophy was present at both 4 and 14 weeks. At the same time points, high hyperglycemia rats showed a global alteration in gene expression with decreased mRNA for insulin, IAPP, islet-associated transcription factors (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1, BETA2/NeuroD, Nkx6.1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α), β-cell metabolic enzymes (glucose transporter 2, glucokinase, mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate carboxylase), and ion channels/pumps (Kir6.2, VDCCβ, and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 3). Conversely, genes normally suppressed in β-cells, such as lactate dehydrogenase-A, hexokinase I, glucose-6-phosphatase, stress genes (heme oxygenase-1, A20, and Fas), and the transcription factor c-Myc, were markedly increased. In contrast, gene expression in low hyperglycemia rats was only minimally changed at 4 weeks but significantly changed at 14 weeks, indicating that even low levels of hyperglycemia induce β-cell dedifferentiation over time. In addition, whereas 2 weeks of correction of hyperglycemia completely reverses the changes in gene expression of Px rats at 4 weeks, the changes at 14 weeks were only partially reversed, indicating that the phenotype becomes resistant to reversal in the long term. In conclusion, chronic hyperglycemia induces a progressive loss of β-cell phenotype with decreased expression of β-cell-associated genes and increased expression of normally suppressed genes, these changes being present with even minimal levels of hyperglycemia. Thus, both the severity and duration of hyperglycemia appear to contribute to the deterioration of the β-cell phenotype found in diabetes.

With the increased demand of insulin resistance and obesity, an adaptation in β-cell mass and secretion can keep glucose levels within a narrow range (3Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Bonner-Weir S.

The failure of β-cells to adequately adapt to increased demand is fundamental to the pathogenesis of all forms of diabetes. We have hypothesized that abnormal β-cell function in diabetes is due to the loss of the unique expression pattern of genes that optimize glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS)1 and insulin synthesis (5Weir G.C. Laybutt D.R. Kaneto H. Bonner-Weir S. Sharma A. Diabetes. 2001; 50 Suppl. 1: 154-159Google Scholar). The development of the endocrine pancreas and the maintenance of β-cell differentiation is regulated by a network of transcription factors, which includes pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1), BETA2/NeuroD, Nkx6.1, and hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs). These factors regulate transcription of the insulin gene and genes involved in β-cell glucose sensing such as GLUT2 and glucokinase (6Waeber G. Thompson N. Nicod P. Bonny C. Mol.

Optimal β-cell function is dependent on expression of these genes and the suppression of other genes, including lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A), hexokinase I, and enzymes required for gluconeogenesis, that can be predicted to interfere with optimal secretion. In this study, we have extended our previous findings examining the influence of the diabetic milieu on β-cell differentiation in the rat partial pancreatectomy (Px) model of diabetes (13Jonas J.C.

Active regeneration is seen during the first 7–10 days following surgery, but by 14 days the morphology of the pancreas has stabilized, appearing similar to what is seen at much later time points. We have found that at the 4-week time point after surgery there is a loss of β-cell differentiation associated with insulin secretory defects and β-cell hypertrophy (13Jonas J.C. Sharma A.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2270-2276Google Scholar). Questions have been raised as to whether this 4-week time point provides a representative view of islet adaptation to the diabetic milieu or whether the findings resulted from some regeneration artifact. For these reasons, islet phenotype and morphology were examined at both 4 and 14 weeks following partial pancreatectomy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY), weighing 90–100 g were submitted to 85–95% Px or sham Px surgery as previously described (13Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H.

For partial pancreatectomy, tissue removal was performed by gentle abrasion with cotton applicators leaving the pancreas within 1–2 mm of the common pancreatic bile duct and extending from the duct to the first part of the duodenum. The proportion of the gastric lob removed was varied to generate 85–95% Px rats that develop different degrees of hyperglycemia (13Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14112-14121Google Scholar). For sham surgery, the pancreatic tissue was only lightly rubbed instead of being removed. Animals were weighed, and blood was obtained in heparinized microcapillary tubes from snipped tails of fed rats (9–10 a.m.) weekly. Whole-blood glucose levels were measured with a portable Medisense Precision QID® glucometer (Abbott Laboratories, Bedford, MA). Rats were classified according to their averaged blood glucose levels from 3 weeks after surgery; low hyperglycemia (LPx) was assigned to Px rats with blood glucose levels less than 150 mg/dl, and high hyperglycemia (HPx) was assigned above 150 mg/dl. To assess the effects of the duration of hyperglycemia on islet gene expression, rats were anesthetized at 4 and 14 weeks after surgery, and their islets were isolated with collagenase digestion of the pancreatic remnant or sham pancreas. Islets were further separated with a Histopaque density gradient (Histopaque-1077; Sigma) and hand-picked under a stereomicroscope. Islets of similar size were used for extraction of RNA. In several cases, it was necessary to pool islets from two Px rats with similar glycemic levels to obtain an islet yield that was sufficient for RNA extraction. Animals were kept under conventional conditions with free access to water and standard pelleted food. All animal procedures were approved by the Joslin Diabetes Center Animal Care Committee. Total RNA was extracted from islets using Ultraspec RNA isolation reagent according to the manufacturer's suggested protocols (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX) and quantified by spectrophotometry. RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in a final reaction solution of 25 μl containing the following: 1× Superscript first strand buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mm KCl, and 3 mmMgCl2) (Invitrogen), 40 units of Rnasin (Promega, Madison, WI), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTP, 50 ng of random hexamers, and 200 units of Superscript II Rnase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription reactions were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, and 10 min at 95 °C. Resultant cDNA products were diluted with 50 μl of H2O to a concentration corresponding to 10 ng of starting RNA per 1.5 μl. PCRs were carried out in a volume of 25 μl consisting of 10 ng of cDNA, 1× GeneAmp PCR Gold buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 1–2 mm MgCl2, 80–160 μm dNTP, 80–600 nmol of oligonucleotide primers (Sigma), 1.25 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Table Ishows specific concentrations of MgCl2, dNTP, and oligonucleotide primers, along with multiplex PCR conditions for each gene tested. Reactions were performed in a 9700 Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in which samples underwent a 10-min initial denaturing step, followed by the number of cycles indicated (Table I), for durations of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at the annealing temperature indicated in Table I, and 1 min at 72 °C. The final extension step was 10 min at 72 °C. Amplimers were resolved by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× Tris borate EDTA buffer. The amount of [α-32P]dCTP incorporated into amplimers was measured with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and quantified with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The average intensity of each product was expressed relative to the internal control gene (ratio of specific product/control gene). These ratios were then used to calculate the percentage of sham expression for each Px animal in the same reverse transcription-PCR. We have previously verified (13Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W.

Open table in a new tab Plasma insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Plasma lipids were measured from samples collected in ETDA/diethyl-para-nitrophenyl phosphate (paraoxan)-coated tubes to avoid activation of lipoprotein lipase by heparin (19Zambon A. Hashimoto S.I. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1021-1028Google Scholar). Plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were measured by a colorimetric method (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). Plasma triglyceride were measured with a triglyceride assay kit (GPO Trinder; Sigma) using glycerol as a standard. To reverse hyperglycemia, Px rats were treated with phlorizin for the final 2 weeks of the 14-week study period. Phlorizin was dissolved in 1,2-propanediol and injected intraperitoneally twice a day (9 a.m. and 9 p.m.) at a dose of 0.8 g/kg/day. Sham animals received similar amounts of 1,2-propanediol as phlorizin-treated Px rats. β-Cell size was measured in sections of pancreas from sham and Px rats stained with glucagon (rabbit anti-bovine glucagon; gift of M. Appel, Worcester, MA) and counterstained with hematoxylin as previously described (17Xu G. Stoffers D.A. Habener J.F. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2270-2276Google Scholar). The number of islet nuclei were counted (nuclei of cells staining for glucagon were excluded), and the area of these cells was quantitated using image analysis software (IP Lab Spectrum). Average cross-sectional β-cell area was determined as the area of the cells divided by the number of nuclei. An average of 725 ± 96 cells/animal were measured. To assess the influence of short term hyperglycemia on islet gene expression in vivo, catheterized rats (∼250 g) were infused for 4 days with glucose (500 g/liter hydrated glucose, McGaw, Irvine, CA) or saline (4.5 g/liter) as described (20Steil G.M.

The glucose infusion rate was regularly adjusted to maintain the blood glucose level at ∼200 mg/dl, with saline infusion adjusted accordingly. At the end of the infusion period, islets were isolated, and RNA was extracted for reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Experiments were performed on islet extracts from rats used in our previous study (21Jonas J.C. Laybutt D.R. Steil G.M. Trivedi N. Pertusa J.G. Van de Casteele M. Weir G.C. Henquin J.C. J. Biol.

Time course changes in blood glucose levels after Px are shown in Fig. 1. As previously described (13Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol.

However, after 14 weeks, the range of blood glucose levels in Px rats had clustered into two distinct groups with either low or high levels of hyperglycemia (Fig. 1). Px rats were classified into groups according to their averaged fed blood glucose levels; LPx below 150 mg/dl and HPx above 150 mg/dl. The time course changes in body weight and fed blood glucose in LPx, HPx, and sham-Px rats are illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described (13Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patane G.

Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1715-1720Google Scholar), weight gain in Px rats was slightly decreased during the first few days after surgery, resulting in significantly lower body weights at 1 week postsurgery. Thereafter, Px rats gained weight at the same rate as sham Px rats. After 8 weeks, LPx rats had body weights not significantly different from age-matched sham rats, whereas HPx rats had lower body weights throughout the study period. Averaged post-3-week fed blood glucose levels ranged from 97 to 111 mg/dl in sham rats, from 108 to 141 mg/dl in LPx rats, and from 220 to 365 mg/dl in HPx rats. The blood glucose levels of HPx rats were significantly increased by 1 week after surgery and remained significantly higher compared with sham and LPx rats throughout the study (p < 0.001). Blood glucose levels of LPx rats were not different from sham at 1 week after surgery; however, the averaged post-3-week blood glucose levels in LPx rats were significantly higher than sham (p < 0.01).Figure 2Time course changes in body weight and fed blood glucose levels in Px rats classified according to their averaged blood glucose levels post-Px. Values are means ± S.E. for sham (open circles, n = 5), LPx (closed circles, n = 6), and HPx (closed squares, n = 11) rats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The expression of islet-associated transcription factors, islet hormones, specialized β-cell metabolic enzymes, and ion channels/pumps along with other normally suppressed metabolic enzymes and stress genes were measured in islets from sham, LPx, and HPx rats sacrificed 4 and 14 weeks after surgery. After normalization of the specific gene to an internal control gene (TBP, α-tubulin, cyclophilin, or 18 S rRNA), mRNA levels in LPx and HPx islets were quantitated as a percentage of sham (Table II). The expression levels of several transcription factors (PDX-1; also known as IDX-1, IPF-1, and STF-1), β-cell E-box trans-activator 2 (BETA2/NeuroD), Nkx6.1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α)) important for pancreas and islet development and the maintenance of β-cell differentiation were assessed in Px islets. After 4 weeks, the mRNA levels of PDX-1, BETA2/NeuroD, Nkx6.1, and HNF1α were unaltered in islets from LPx rats, whereas in HPx rats they were reduced by 50–60% compared with sham (Table II). After 14 weeks, the mRNA levels for PDX-1, Nkx6.1, and HNF1α were significantly reduced in LPx rats (30–40%) and were further reduced in HPx rats (50–60%). Thus, expression levels in LPx rats were unaltered at 4 weeks but significantly reduced after 14 weeks. Therefore, the down-regulation of islet-associated transcription factors after Px showed an association with increasing blood glucose levels and the duration of hyperglycemia. On the other hand, c-Myc is a transcription factor minimally expressed in replicating cells, which is consistent with its low level expression in adult islets (13Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14112-14121Google Scholar, 22Katic M. Hadzija M. Wrischer M. Pavelic K. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1521-1527Google Scholar). After 4 weeks, c-Myc mRNA levels were unaltered in LPx rats but were increased in HPx rats (Table II). After 14 weeks, c-Myc mRNA levels were significantly increased in LPx rats and were increased further in HPx rats compared with sham control rats (p < 0.05 among groups). Therefore, the up-regulation of c-Myc was associated with increasing blood glucose levels and the duration of hyperglycemia.Table IIChanges in islet gene mRNA levels in rats with different degrees of hyperglycemia 4 and 14 weeks after Px4 weeks14 weeksSham (n = 5)LPx (n = 4)HPx (n = 4)Sham (n = 5)LPx (n = 5)HPx (n = 6)Blood glucose (mg/dl)105 ± 2130 ± 52-ap < 0.01versus 4-week sham.282 ± 152-bp < 0.001 versus4-week sham.104 ± 3124 ± 42-cp < 0.01 versus14-week sham.294 ± 152-dp < 0.001 versus14-week sham.Transcription factors PDX-1100 ± 1086 ± 1547 ± 92-ap < 0.01versus 4-week sham.100 ± 463 ± 112-ep < 0.05 versus14-week sham.39 ± 42-dp < 0.001 versus14-week sham.

A comparison with P450 EryF (CYP107A1) reveals a remarkable overall similarity in fold with major differences residing in active site structural elements. The high resolution obtained allows visualization of several unusual aspects. The heme cofactor is bound in two distinct conformations while being notably kinked in one pyrrole group due to close interaction with the proline residue (Pro346) immediately following the heme iron-ligating cysteine (Cys345). The active site is remarkably rigid in comparison with the remainder of the structure, notwithstanding the large cavity volume of 1350 Å3. The region immediately surrounding the distal water ligand is remarkable in several aspects. Unlike other bacterial P450s, the I helix shows no deformation, similar to mammalian CYP2C5. In addition, the positively charged Arg386 is located immediately above the heme plane, dominating the local structure. Putative proton relay pathways from protein surface to heme (converging at Ser279) are identified. Most interestingly, the electron density indicates weak binding of a dioxygen molecule to the P450.

The vast majority of P450s bind and cleave molecular oxygen in a two-step reaction involving delivery of two electrons from a redox partner. In eukaryotic P450s, this is typically the diflavin enzyme NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (4Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). However, in prokaryotes the reducing equivalents are usually supplied via two enzymes: NAD(P)H flavodoxin/ferredoxin reductase and either a ferredoxin or a flavodoxin mediator of electrons to the P450 (5Munro A.W.

Many bacterial P450s are of particular biotechnological and environmental relevance, given their role in degradation of recalcitrant organic molecules for use as energy sources (e.g. Refs. 7Gunsalus I.C.

Bacterial P450s have also proven to be experimentally tractable systems for elucidation of P450 structure and mechanism, due largely to the fact that they are soluble enzymes, as opposed to their eukaryotic membrane-associated counterparts (5Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A breakthrough was made recently with the atomic structure of the first mammalian P450 (a form of P450 2C5). In this case, extensive protein engineering was required to remove the N-terminal membrane anchor peptide, to promote release from the cellular membrane and to prevent aggregation of the resultant solubilized P450 (9Williams P.A.

The genome sequence of Mtb revealed several interesting features, most notably the preponderance of genes involved in lipid metabolism; ∼250 enzymes involved in lipid metabolism have been identified in Mtb (cf. ∼50 for the similarly sized Escherichia coli genome). The importance of lipid metabolism in Mtb may explain the high P450 content, since typical cellular functions for P450s in eukaryotes and other bacteria are as mono-oxygenases for lipophilic fatty acids, polyketides, steroids, and xenobiotics (e.g. see Ref. 2Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 611-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Sterols are rare in bacteria, but the P450 product of the Mtb Rv0764c gene (CYP51) is highly related to eukaryotic sterol demethylases and has been shown to catalyze demethylation of plant and eukaryotic sterols (13Bellamine A. Mangla A.T. Nes W.D. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8937-8942Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Mtb CYP51 was solved in complex with the azole antifungal drug fluconazole (14Podust L.M. Poulos T.L. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3068-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). This structure is of biotechnological importance, given the importance of the eukaryotic CYP51s in physiology and also in view of the fact that the yeast and fungal CYP51 enzymes (lanosterol demethylases) are validated targets for the azole antifungal class of drugs of which fluconazole is a member (15Bille J. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2000; 16: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In recent studies, the potency of these drugs as antibiotics against growth of Mtb's relative Mycobacterium smegmatis and the related actinomycete S. coelicolor has been shown (16McLean K.J. Marshall K.R. Richmond A. Hunter I.S. Fowler K. Kieser T. Gurcha S.S. Besra G.S. Munro A.W. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2937-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The biochemical functions of the remaining P450 enzymes in Mtb are not immediately obvious. This is primarily because of limited similarity to other members of the P450 superfamily with known catalytic properties. Most show highest similarity to other P450 enzymes in Mtb, perhaps suggesting co-evolution as oxygenases of related, complex lipids in the bacterium (17Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). We decided to focus efforts on the product of geneRv2276, a P450 enzyme classified as CYP121 (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2663) Google Scholar). This P450 shows amino acid sequence similarity to a number of polyketide mono-oxygenase P450s, including the structurally characterized P450 EryF (CYP107A1) from Saccharopolyspora erythraea(18Andersen J.F. Tatsuta K. Gunji H. Ishiyama T. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role in polyketide metabolism in Mtb. In addition, the known high affinity of P450 EryF for the azole antifungal class of drugs suggests that CYP121 could be a potential drug target in the pathogen, particularly since the role of CYP51, its validity as a drug target, and whether sterol metabolism is really a feature of the pathogen remain to be established. Indeed, the fact that a ΔCYP51 strain of S. coelicolor is nonlethal (16McLean K.J. Marshall K.R. Richmond A. Hunter I.S. Fowler K. Kieser T. Gurcha S.S. Besra G.S. Munro A.W. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2937-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Lamb D.C. Fowler K. Kieser T. Manning N. Podust L.M. Waterman M.R. Kelly D.E. Kelly S.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that the strain exhibits no significant alteration in sensitivity to azole antifungal drugs (16McLean K.J. Marshall K.R. Richmond A. Hunter I.S. Fowler K. Kieser T. Gurcha S.S. Besra G.S. Munro A.W. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2937-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) confirms that CYP51 is not the target in this actinomycete. Our initial expression and biophysical studies have established that the Mtb P450 CYP121 has properties typical for members of this class (20McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Whereas the physiological role remains unclear, the enzyme binds bulky azole antifungal drugs with high affinity, and the binding constants for these drugs are perturbed by the presence of erythromycin and other large polyketides, suggesting that CYP121 may metabolizes polyketides or bulky polycyclics in vivo. However, what is most remarkable is that in comparison with Mtb CYP51, the binding of a variety of azole antifungal drugs to Mtb CYP121 is tighter and that the order of their K d values correlates well with the minimal inhibitory concentration values for these drugs forM. smegmatis and S. coelicolor (16McLean K.J. Marshall K.R. Richmond A. Hunter I.S. Fowler K. Kieser T. Gurcha S.S. Besra G.S. Munro A.W. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2937-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Since the drugs retain their high potency against a S. coelicolor CYP51 knockout strain, other P450 enzyme(s) must be the true targets in this bacterium; thus, the fact that potency of azole drugsversus mycobacteria correlates with CYP121K d values must make this a prime drug target candidate (20McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have previously reported crystallization of CYP121 (21Mowat C.G. Leys D. McLean K.J. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Munro A.W. Lombardia M.O. Alzari P.M. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Walkinshaw M.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2002; 58: 704-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and in this paper we report the crystal structure of CYP121 to 1.06 Å. This unprecedented level of resolution for a P450 system allows, for the first time, a truly atomic description of the oxygen scission site. The Rv2276gene encoding CYP121 was cloned by PCR from a Mtb chromosomal DNA library (cosmid MTCY339, obtained from Prof. Stewart Cole at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) and cloned into expression plasmid pET11a to produce clone PKM2b, as described previously (20McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The CYP121 protein was produced in E. coli strain HMS174 (DE3) with growth of the culture after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction performed at low temperature (18 °C) to promote production of soluble enzyme. The cells were broken using a French press and sonication, and CYP121 was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation (30–70% fraction retained), followed by successive column chromatography steps on phenyl-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and hydroxyapatite resins, as described (20McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CYP121 crystals belonging to space group P6522 (unit cell dimensions a = 77.81 Å, c = 263.82 Å) were obtained as described previously (21Mowat C.G. Leys D. McLean K.J. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Munro A.W. Lombardia M.O. Alzari P.M. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Walkinshaw M.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2002; 58: 704-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A complete native data set up to 1.06 Å could be measured on a single flash-cooled crystal on ID14–4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Different sections of the crystal were exposed to avoid excessive radiation damage due to the intense beam. Whereas these crystals clearly diffract further, both the long cell axis of 263 Å and the rapid decay of diffraction quality hampered the collection of higher resolution reflections. Data were processed and scaled with the HKL package programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). Despite the availability of several P450 structures, the crystal structure could not be solved using molecular replacement and was solved using a Multiple Isomorphous Replacement with Anomalous Scattering (MIRAS) approach instead. Data were collected on station 14-1 at Synchrotron Radiation Source for two independent heavy metal derivatives. Initial heavy atom sites were found using the program RSPS (23Knight S.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 52: 42-47Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and used for detection of minor sites by difference Fourier analysis. Heavy atom sites were refined using the program MLPHARE (24Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering. Daresbury Study Weekend, Warrington, UK1991Google Scholar), and the weak anomalous signal of the iron was included in the final phase calculations. Data collection and phasing statistics are given in Table I. The program ARP-WARP (25Perrakis A. Morris R.M. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) was used to build an initial model in the solvent flattened maps. This initial model was manually adjusted using TURBO-FRODO (26Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory 86. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) and refined using REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). The structure of the uncomplexed enzyme was refined with anisotropic B-factors for all atoms including a riding hydrogen atom model. With successive rounds of refinement and model building, the entire CYP121 sequence was fitted to the electron density map with the exception of the N-terminal three residues. Multiple conformations were observed for 33 of the 395 residues defined. The final R-factor was 0.132 (R-free = 0.153) for the model consisting of the protein, 800 water molecules, and 3 sulfates per asymmetric unit. The enzyme was complexed with hydrophilic compounds by soaking in the mother liquor (2.3 m ammonium sulfate, pH 6.5) supplemented with a large excess of the ligand. In order to obtain data on complexes with hydrophobic compounds, the crystals were placed in 30% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2m ammonium sulfate, pH 6.5, supplemented with the compound of interest. Only the hydrophilic iodopyrazole proved to bind in the active site, and data were collected for complexed crystals to 1.8 Å.

Open table in a new tab Globally, the CYP121 structure resembles a triagonal prism, as observed for all other P450 structures to date. As with other P450s, there are two distinct structural “domains,” with the heme sandwiched between a smaller β sheet-rich module and a larger helix-rich domain (Fig. 1). The P450s have relatively few definitive amino acid motifs, and evolutionarily distinct P450s may exhibit as little as 15% amino acid identity. However, the cysteine ligand to the heme iron and the region immediately surrounding this amino acid (the “heme-binding” motif) at the C-terminal section of the P450 are strongly conserved (Fig. 2).Figure 2The heme binding motif in M. tuberculosis CYP121 and other cytochromes P450. The heme-binding motif region for Mtb CYP121 (10 amino acids either side of the cysteinate ligand to the heme iron) is shown alignedversus those from prokaryotic and eukaryotic P450s using the ClustalW program (EBI). Four amino acids are conserved throughout, including the cysteine (Cys345 in CYP121), and are highlighted in white against a black background. These identical residues are also indicated by an asteriskat the base of the alignment, and other positions where the amino acid class is retained in each P450 are indicated by dots. Highlighted in gray are those individual amino acids present in 40% or more of the P450s at the respective positions. P450 enzymes are indicated by their formal classification “CYP” numbers (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W.

Given the relative low homology (25.3% identity over 396 amino acids) with P450 EryF (CYP107A1; a macrolide monooxygenase) and the unsuccessful molecular replacement, the high three-dimensional similarity of the substrate-free CYP121 with that of substrate/inhibitor-bound CYP107A1 comes as a surprise (28Cupp-Vickery J.R. Garcia C. Hofacre A. McGee-Estrada K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding this high similarity in fold (Z score 42.3, root mean square deviation 2.6 Å for 379 C-α atoms), several distinct features can be observed in CYP121 for polypeptide stretches lining the active site cavity. Upon comparison of CYP121 with CYP107A1 from N to C terminus, the first region that is drastically different is that immediately following the conserved B helix (Fig. 3). Starting at residue Met62, the polypeptide chain proceeds first with a 310 helix and then with an extended loop forming the dome of the active site relative to the heme plane. This loop proceeds into a second 310 helix that is immediately followed by helices B′ and C. The corresponding polypeptide region in CYP107A1 is longer and bears little or no resemblance, having no regular 310helical structure, whereas helix B′ is separated from C by several residues. The C helix in CYP121 is immediately adjacent to helix B′ and makes a different angle with other conserved structural elements. It is separated from the short D helix by a flexible region that precedes Glu110. From this position onward, both polypeptide chains again assume very similar positions. After helix D and E, the helices F and G are slightly reoriented with respect to the remainder of the structure, and the FG loop that forms a part of the active site dome is bent inward with respect to the CYP107A1 structure. Whereas the CYP121 helix H still occupies a distinct conformation, as does the beginning of helix I, the polypeptide chain trace is once again highly similar to the main part of helix I and remains so for the rest of the structure. Two minor exceptions are the loop following the K helix and the C-terminal region, which are both slightly reoriented and form part of the dome of the active site. These reorganizations in the secondary elements and loops lining the active site cavity result in a slightly increased volume for the CYP121 active site of 1337 Å compared with 1115 Å for the substrate-bound CYP107A1. Whereas in CYP121 the main part of the active site is more compressed due to the closer packing of loops forming the dome of the active site, a significant part of the cavity extends between helices F and G (Fig. 1), accounting for the increased volume in CYP121. As has been observed for the majority of P450 crystal structures (with the notable exceptions of Mtb CYP51 andBacillus megaterium P450 BM3) (14Podust L.M. Poulos T.L. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3068-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 30Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), the active site is apparently inaccessible from the surface in this substrate-free from of the enzyme. This obviously raises the question of how the putative substrate reaches the active site. As has been proposed for other P450s, we envisage the CYP121 structure as oscillating between open and closed conformations whereby the “breathing motions” of the protein, specifically movements of the secondary elements and loops lining the active site, allow for transient exposure of gaps allowing substrate access. It is especially interesting that the active site seems to protrude in between helices F and G, allowing small movements in the relative positions of these helices to open an active site channel (Fig. 1). Similar motions in helices F/G and the interconnecting loop region have been demonstrated to occur for the CYP119 monooxygenase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (31Yano J.K. Koo L.S. Schuller D.J. Li H.Y. de Montellano P.R.O. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31086-31092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As in other P450 enzymes, a cysteine (Cys345) provides the proximal axial ligand to the heme iron, with a well defined water molecule as the distal axial ligand. The Fe-S distance is 2.30 Å, whereas the Fe-O distance is 2.21 Å, both values being highly similar to those in other P450 structures obtained. An unusual aspect of the CYP121 structure is the fact that the heme is clearly bound in one of two distinct conformations, related by a 180° rotation through an axis of symmetry across the Chα-Fe-CHδ atoms of the molecule. In short, the heme is bound either in the “a” or “b” conformer, a phenomenon well known for other heme proteins (e.g.cytochrome b 5) (e.g. see Ref. 32Muskett F.W. Kelly G.P. Whitford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 172-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This mixture of conformers does not otherwise impact on the overall fold of the enzyme. One of the conformers predominates, and the relative occupancy is refined to a 70:30 mixture of the species (Fig. 4 a). In cytochromeb 5, there is dynamic exchange of the heme, such that the proportions of the a- and b-type conformers can be perturbed considerably by temperature (e.g. see Ref. 33Mortuza G.B. Whitford D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The situation is extremely unlikely to be the same in the cytochromes P450, where the heme is bound deep in the protein (not superficially as inb 5) and requires protein denaturation to be released. Whereas insertion of heme and modified hemes into P450 has been demonstrated, this was achieved only very slowly by denaturation of the P450 and refolding by gradual removal of denaturant after the addition of the exogenous heme (e.g. see Ref. 34Modi S. Primrose W.U. Lian L.-Y. Roberts G.C.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The situation is highly unlikely to occur in vivo, and we infer that the heme-binding step in CYP121 (and other P450s) occurs at a relatively early stage in the protein folding process, and the position of the heme as bound commits the P450 to this conformation throughout its lifetime in vivo. One of the four pyrrole rings of the heme is distorted out-of-plane by the close interaction with the side chain of Pro346. The pyrrole is kinked toward the distal face by an angle of ∼30° (Fig. 4 b). Pro346 immediately follows the cysteinate heme ligand (Cys345), and this Cys-Pro motif is found in a number of other cytochrome P450 enzymes, with several of the Mtb P450s having this feature (Fig. 2). This structural perturbation to heme planarity may therefore well be a feature common in other P450 enzymes but previously unrecognized due to the absence of the Cys-Pro motif in P450 structures solved to date. This structural element could indeed be essential to the specific electronic properties of the heme in these oxidases. Recently, we have demonstrated in the P450 BM3 system that a phylogenetically conserved Phe residue (Phe393 located 7 amino acids before the cysteine ligand) that also stacks with both heme plane and packs with the cysteinate ligand exerts a large effect on the heme electronic properties (Fig. 2) (35Ost T.W.B. Miles C.S. Munro A.W. Murdoch J. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13421-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is therefore highly likely that this proline residue, being closer to both heme and cysteinate ligand than even the phenylalanine (Phe338 in CYP121), has a considerable impact on the heme catalytic and thermodynamic properties.

Recent studies on cell apoptosis reveal that cytochromec is responsible for the programmed cell death when it is released from mitochondria to cytoplasm.

An alternative electron-leak pathway of the respiratory chain is suggested to explain how cytochrome c affects on the generation and elimination of O2⨪ and H2O2 in mitochondria. Enough cytochrome c in the respiratory chain is needed for keeping O2⨪ and H2O2at a lower physiological level.

The precursor of H2O2 has been shown to be the superoxide anion formed through a single electron reduction of O2 by the electrons leaked from the substrate side of the respiratory chain (5Loschen G. Azzi A. Richter C. Flohé L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 42: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The rate of H2O2 production in isolated mitochondria under state 4 respiration is 0.6–1.0 nmol·mg−1min−1, which is about 2% of the total oxygen uptake under physiological conditions (1Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar, 4Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4782) Google Scholar). Two sites in the respiratory chain have been found to be responsible for the generation of O2⨪. One of these sites is located in complex I and the other in complex III (2Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 7Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). O2⨪ production is probably via autooxidation of the reduced flavin mononucleotide of NADH dehydrogenase in complex I (2Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Two components, the ubisemiquinone (8Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and the reduced cytochrome b (9Loschen G. Azzi A. Flohé L. FEBS Lett. 1973; 33: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have been suggested to be the autooxidizable factors causing O2⨪ production in complex III. Using the purified succinate-cytochrome c reductase, Zhang et al. (10Zhang L., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33972-33976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) confirmed that the exact site leaking electrons to generate O2⨪ in complex III is in the Q-cycle. O2⨪ is a short-lived ion that can rapidly evolve to H2O2 along three pathways: 1) the catalysis of superoxide dismutase; 2) chemical dismutation; and 3) HOO., in equilibrium with O2⨪, reacting with membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids to produce heat and H2O2 (11Bielski B.J.H. Arudi R.L. Sutherland M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4759-4761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both O2⨪ and H2O2 are potentially dangerous if they are not removed in time. Therefore, a mechanism to protect respiration enzymes from the damage of the generated ROS is needed around the respiratory chain.In our early studies on the purified succinate-cytochrome creductase, we found that the electrons transferred from succinate to cytochrome c can be further delivered to the extra added H2O2 (12Xu J-X. Abstracts of the 2nd Japan-China Bilateral Symposium on Biophysics, Kyoto, Japan, May 16–20, 1988. Biophysical Society of Japan, Japan1988: 79-80Google Scholar). An alternative electron leak pathway of respiratory chain was later suggested (13Xu J-X. Prog. Biochem. Biophys. (Chinese). 1995; 22: 179-180Google Scholar, 14Xu J-X. Li X. Zhang Y-X Shang H-Y. Proceedings of the Interntional Symposium on Native Antioxidants: Molecular Mechanism and Health Effects. AOCS Press, Champaign, Illinois1996: 530-539Google Scholar). In this study, using the cytochrome c-depleted Keilin-Hartree heart muscle preparation (c-dHMP), we show that the alternative electron leak pathway may acted on the scavenging of O2⨪ and H2O2 in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.DISCUSSIONIt is well established that mitochondria are the main source of ROS generation in cell. An antioxidative role of cytochromec in vivo has been suggested (25Forman H.J. Azzi A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 374-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Skulacheve V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In the living cell, a compound generated in a metabolic step is always eliminated in the next step of the metabolic reaction chain. The oxygen radicals also obey the rule of metabolism. It has been well accepted that the generation of O2⨪ and H2O2 in the substrate side of respiratory chain is a result of electron leakage of the chain. In this study, an alternative electron-leak pathway is suggested to explain the elimination of the generated O2⨪and H2O2. Based on the scheme shown in Fig. 3, the level of O2⨪ and H2O2 is in a balanced state between generation in the substrate side of respiratory chain and elimination in the oxygen side cytochrome c. The lower content of cytochrome c in the respiratory chain causes the higher level of O2⨪ and H2O2accumulated.The experimental results demonstrate that cytochrome cstrongly affects the generation and elimination of O2⨪ and H2O2 in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The amount of O2⨪ and H2O2 generated in the c-dHMP is 7–8 times higher than that in normal preparations. The reconstitution of cytochrome c to the c-dHMP causes O2⨪ and H2O2 generation to decrease exponentially. This result implies that sufficient cytochromec in the respiratory chain is needed for both the high activity of respiration and the low generation of O2⨪ and H2O2. This property of cytochrome cis facilitated to the mitochondria for keeping reactive oxygen species at a normal physiological level. The release of cytochrome c from the respiratory chain will cause a dramatic increase of O2⨪ and H2O2generation.The exponential decay curves of the O2⨪ and H2O2 generation were all simulated as an equation having one constant term and two exponential terms. The following three mechanisms might be involved in the effect of cytochrome c on the generation and elimination of O2⨪ and H2O2. First, the reconstitution of cytochrome c facilitates the electron transfer of the respiratory chain, thus the leakage of electrons reduced and the decreased generation of O2⨪ and H2O2. This mechanism may correspond to the constant term of the simulation formula. Second, the O2⨪ generated by the electron leakage can be oxidized by ferricytochrome c directly based on the reaction mentioned by Forman and Fridovich (23Forman H.J. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 158: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Third, the H2O2 can be scavenged by the cytochromec-mediated electron delivery shown in Fig. 3. The second two mechanisms may correspond to the two exponential terms of the simulation formula. The cytochrome c not only affects the generation of O2⨪ and H2O2 by making the electron transfer of the respiratory chain more fluent, but also eliminating the generated O2⨪ and H2O2through a cytochrome c-mediated electron-leak pathway.The O2⨪ and H2O2 generation in cytochrome c-depleted HMP and KCN-inhibited HMP are quite difference. The level of H2O2 in KCN-HMP is only 60% of that in c-dHMP. This result reflects that the cytochromec in KCN-HMP scavenges about 40% H2O2 through the cytochromec-mediated electron-leak pathway. Once the O2⨪ is generated in the substrate side of the respiratory chain, one portion is dismutated to H2O2 and another portion is rapidly scavenged by ferricytochrome c directly. This could be the reason that O2⨪ is not accumulated in preparations containing cytochrome c. The more cytochrome cthat is reconstituted to the c-dHMP, the less O2⨪ and H2O2 are accumulated. These results support that the alternative electron-leak pathway mediated by cytochromec is working in mitochondria.Cytochrome c is strongly involved in cell apoptosis (26Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4435) Google Scholar). Two groups of cytochrome c in mitochondria are suggested: the bound cytochrome c in the outer face of the inner membrane of mitochondria and the free cytochrome c in the space of inner and outer membrane (27Skulacheve V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 28Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 91: 1259-1263Crossref Scopus (777) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the reconstituted cytochrome c is in the loosely bound state with the HMP membrane, therefore the loosely bound cytochromec may have an antioxidative effect in mitochondria. It is revealed that a dramatic increase of O2⨪ and H2O2 in mitochondria appears at the same time that cytochrome c leaves the respiratory chain. Therefore, the involvement of electron leakage in cell apoptosis is an interesting project. The burst of O2⨪ and H2O2happens earlier than that of cytochrome c arriving at the precaspase-stimulating position, suggesting that ROS may act as a kind of apoptogen in the very early stage of apoptosis.Cytochrome c is a small, very stable hemoprotein containing covalently bound heme c as a prosthetic group. The primary recognized function of cytochrome c is to transfer electrons from complex III (QH2-cytochrome c reductase) to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in the respiratory chain. The finding of cytochrome c starting cell apoptosis implies that the cytochrome c has a different function in different locations in the cell. The observations in this study lead us to propose that cytochrome c may act as an antioxidative factor to regulate the O2⨪ and H2O2 level of mitochondria, and this is involved in programmed cell death. Mitochondria represent a primary source of ROS1 in most aerobic mammalian cells (1Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar, 2Turrens J.F.

The H2O2 concentration in liver cells has been estimated to be 10−7–10−9mol/liter and that of superoxide anion to be about 10−11 mol/liter (1Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem.

Clark E.A. Filbin M. Gordon S. Jones Y. Kehrl J.H. Kelm S., Le Douarin N. Powell L. Roder J. Schnaar R.L. Sgroi D.C. Stamenkovic K. Schauer R. Schachner M. van den Berg T.K. van der Merwe P.A. Watt S.M. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: vGoogle Scholar). There are at least 11 bona fide members in humans and potentially 8 in mice, all of which are type 1 membrane proteins, containing an N-terminal sialic acid-binding V-set Ig domain and varying numbers of C2-set Ig domains (2Angata T. Hingorani R. Varki N.M. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45128-45136Google Scholar). Apart from myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG, Siglec-4), which is found uniquely in the nervous system, Siglecs are expressed predominantly in the hemopoietic and immune systems and appear to mediate both adhesive and signaling functions (3Crocker P.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 609-615Google Scholar). Siglecs can be divided into two subgroups based on sequence similarity in the extracellular and intracellular regions. Sialoadhesin (Siglec-1), CD22 (Siglec-2), and MAG constitute one subgroup, share ∼25–30% sequence identity in the extracellular region, and have divergent cytoplasmic tails. The second subgroup is made up of the CD33-related Siglecs that include CD33 (Siglec-3) and the recently discovered human Siglecs 5–11 (reviewed in Ref. 3Crocker P.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 609-615Google Scholar). These proteins share 50–80% sequence similarity and have two highly conserved tyrosine-based motifs in their cytoplasmic tails. In humans, the CD33-related Siglec genes are clustered on chromosome 19q13.3–4 and are separate from the genes encoding CD22, MAG (19q13.1), and sialoadhesin (20p). Recent studies using specific monoclonal antibodies have shown that the CD33-related Siglecs are expressed in a partially overlapping manner on all major leukocytes of the innate immune system, suggesting a role for these proteins in regulation of leukocyte function. This is further supported by the finding that human CD33-related Siglecs have two conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-like sequences, which in all cases studied can interact with the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 following tyrosine phosphorylation (4Paul S.P. Taylor L.S. Stansbury E.K. McVicar D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 483-490Google Scholar, 5Ulyanova T. Shah D.D. Thomas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14451-14458Google Scholar, 6Whitney G. Wang S.L. Chang H.

Recent studies of CD22 (Siglec-2) have also illustrated the importance of sialic acid recognition and specificity in triggering biological functions mediated by Siglecs (9Jin L. McLean P.A. Neel B.G. Wortis H.H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1199-1205Google Scholar, 10Kelm S. Gerlach J. Brossmer R. Danzer C.P. Nitschke L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1207-1213Google Scholar, 11Lanoue A. Batista F.D. Stewart M. Neuberger M.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 348-355Google Scholar). To date, structural information on the Siglecs is limited to the V-set domain of sialoadhesin (Siglec-1) in complex with 3′-sialyllactose (12May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Google Scholar). A 1.8-Å crystal structure revealed the basis for recognition of the terminal sialic acid. This mode of recognition is likely to be common to all Siglecs. However, the structure did not give insights into the differential specificity for sialic acid linkages exhibited by the Siglecs. Furthermore, the low sequence similarity shared between sialoadhesin and the CD33-related Siglecs is an obstacle to interpreting mutagenesis data in a structural framework. It would therefore be desirable to obtain the structure of at least one member of the CD33-related subgroup, which could be used as a template for modeling other CD33-related Siglecs as well as for gaining molecular insights into sialic acid linkage recognition in the Siglec family. In this context, Siglec-7 is of particular interest since it is the major Siglec expressed by natural killer cells (13Falco M. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Vitale M. Sivori S. Augugliaro R. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 793-801Google Scholar, 14Nicoll G., Ni, J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34089-34095Google Scholar) and possesses a unique preference for α(2,8)-linked disialic acids over α(2,6)- and α(2,3)-linked sialic acids (15Yamaji T. Teranishi T. Alphey M.S. Crocker P.R. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6324-6332Google Scholar). When cross-linked at the cell surface in a redirected killing assay, Siglec-7 was capable of inhibiting the cytotoxicity toward cell targets and is therefore a potential natural killer cell inhibitory receptor (13Falco M. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Vitale M. Sivori S. Augugliaro R. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 793-801Google Scholar). Similar to CD22 on B cells, glycan recognition by Siglec-7 is likely to be directly linked to its function in modulating the activation of natural killer cells. Siglec-7 is closely related to Siglec-9 with 80% overall sequence identity (2Angata T. Hingorani R. Varki N.M. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45128-45136Google Scholar, 16Zhang J.Q. Nicoll G. Jones C. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22121-22126Google Scholar). However, Siglec-9 cannot bind α(2,8)-linked disialic acids and prefers α(2,3)- and α(2,6)-linked terminal sialic acids (2Angata T. Hingorani R. Varki N.M. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45128-45136Google Scholar, 15Yamaji T. Teranishi T. Alphey M.S. Crocker P.R. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6324-6332Google Scholar, 16Zhang J.Q. Nicoll G. Jones C. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22121-22126Google Scholar). Using protein chimeras, this difference in sialic acid linkage preference was recently shown to reside in a 6-amino acid stretch within the C-C′ loop of Siglecs-7 and -9 (15Yamaji T. Teranishi T. Alphey M.S. Crocker P.R. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6324-6332Google Scholar). In the present study, we have obtained the first crystal structure of the Siglec-7 V-set domain, in two crystal forms refined to 1.75 and 1.9 Å. Comparison of Siglec-7 with a model of Siglec-9 shows that differences in residues in the tip of the C-C′ loop may explain the preference of Siglec-7 for α(2,8)-linked disialic acids. The Siglec-7 structure also reveals a fully ordered N-linked glycan and interesting crystallographic packing interactions within the ligand-binding site. The structure will provide a useful template for modeling other CD33-related Siglecs. The Siglec-7 V-set domain was PCR-amplified from CD33-like HDPUW68 in the pSPORT vector (Invitrogen) (14Nicoll G., Ni, J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34089-34095Google Scholar) using the forward primer (5′-ACTTCTAGAGCACCTCCAACCCCAGATATG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ACTGGATCCTTATGTCACGTTCACAGAGAGCTG-3′). The amplified gene was inserted into the pDEF mammalian expression vector viaXbaI and BamHI restriction sites introduced by the primers (bold). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Chinese hamster ovary Lec1 (CHO Lec1) cells using FuGENE (Roche Pharmaceuticals). The CHO Lec1 cells stably expressing the Siglec-7 V-set domain were selected in the presence of hygromycin and cultivated in α-MEM containing 5% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin mix (Invitrogen). Secreted protein was harvested and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and then passed over an 8-ml anti-Siglec-7 polyclonal antibody column. This was prepared by coupling affinity-purified sheep anti-Siglec-7 IgG to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) at 5 mg/ml. Protein was eluted from the antibody affinity column using 8-ml aliquots of 0.1m glycine buffer, pH 2.5, followed by immediate neutralization with 10% 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Resulting fractions were buffer-exchanged into 0.025 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl. Further purification was achieved using a Superdex 75 16/60 column on an Akta Purifier system (AmershamBiosciences). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The protein was concentrated for crystallization to 5 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 10-kDa cutoff spin concentrator (Vivascience). Crystallization experiments were carried out at 20 °C using hanging drop vapor diffusion. Crystallization conditions were found using a sparse matrix sampling approach with Crystal Screens I and II from Hampton Research. A drop of 0.5 μl of protein (5 mg/ml in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) was mixed with 0.5 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 250 μl of reservoir solution. Small crystals appeared after 2 days in Screen I conditions 9 (0.2 mammonium acetate, 0.1 m trisodium citrate, pH 5.6, 30% polyethylene glycol 4000) and 28 (0.2 m sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 30% polyethylene glycol 8000). The initial crystals (crystal form 1, Sig7a) from condition 9 were cryoprotected using solution 9 from Cryo Screen (Hampton Research) and frozen in a nitrogen stream. Subsequently, a second crystal form (Sig7b) was found in conditions identical to those for Sig7a. These crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant consisting of 30% polyethylene glycol monomethylether 5000, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and then frozen in a nitrogen stream. X-ray data for Sig7a were collected at beamline ID14-EH2 European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) on an ADSC Quantum4 CCD at a temperature of 100 K (see Table I). Data for Sig7b were collected at beamline ID29 (ESRF) on an ADSC Q210 CCD at a temperature of 100 K (see Table I). All data were processed and scaled with the HKL suite of programs (17Otwinowski Z.

All measured data were included in structure refinement. Open table in a new tab Values between brackets are for the highest resolution shell. All measured data were included in structure refinement. The Sig7a structure was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) using the sialoadhesin structure (Protein Data Bank entry: 1QFO (12May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Google Scholar)) as a search model. A single solution was found with an R-factor of 0.505 (correlation coefficient = 0.337). The resulting model phases were used as input for Arp/wARP (19Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Google Scholar), which built 82 out of 127 residues. This was followed by refinement with CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) interspersed with model building in O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Five percent of the data were set aside for calculation of R free (22Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Google Scholar). After several rounds of refinement, the model was incomplete. No electron density was observed for the B-C and the C-C′ loops (residues 53–57 and 68–74, respectively) and the N terminus (residues 18–23). This structure was used as a search model in AMoRe against 8–4-Å diffraction data collected on Sig7b. A single solution was found with anR-factor of 0.386 (correlation coefficient = 0.723). This was followed by refinement in CNS and manual model building with O. A well defined density for the complete glycan structure attached to Asn-105 was observed (see Fig. 1). In general, the Sig7b electron density maps, although calculated from lower resolution data, were of higher quality than those for Sig7a and allowed building of the flexible loops and extension of the N terminus, resulting in a model with a final R-factor of 0.210 (R free= 0.255, see Table I). A model of Siglec-9 was produced by homology modeling with WHAT IF (23Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Google Scholar) using the Sig7b structure as a template. A model of the Siglec-7/9 interaction with disialic acid was produced through superposition of the sialoadhesin-sialyllactose structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1QFO(12May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Google Scholar)) of the Siglec-7/9 structures followed by superposition of disialic acid (from Protein Data Bank entry 1FV2 (24Fotinou C. Emsley P. Black I. Ando H. Ishida H. Kiso M. Sinha K.A. Fairweather N.F. Isaacs N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32274-32281Google Scholar)) using the coordinates for the first sialic acid. The structure of the Siglec-7 V-set ligand-binding domain was solved by molecular replacement in two crystal forms (Sig7a and Sig7b) and refined to 1.75 Å (r = 0.223, R free = 0.249) and 1.9 Å (r = 0.210, R free = 0.255) resolution, respectively (TableI). The Sig7a structure is incomplete, with loops B-C, C-C′, and the 6 N-terminal residues missing. The Sig7b structure is complete from residue 18 to 144 and includes a fully ordered N-linked glycan with a truncated structure as defined by the CHO Lec1 cell line used (discussed below). All analyses described here are based on the Sig7b structure, although all figures shown here include the side chain conformation of Arg-124 (a key ligand-binding residue) as seen in the Sig7a structure. The Sig7b Ramachandran plot calculated with PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) shows that 98.3% of non-glycine residues are in the most favorable and additionally allowed regions. Two residues, Gln-19 and Asp-93, are in disallowed regions, which are located in disordered regions of the map. CHO Lec1 mammalian cells cannot synthesize complex oligosaccharides (26Stanley P. Narasimhan S. Siminovitch L. Schachter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3323-3327Google Scholar) due to a point mutation in theN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI), resulting in homogenous glycosylation with the structure Man5-GlcNAc2 (27Puthalakath H. Burke J. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27818-27822Google Scholar)). This is advantageous for protein crystallography studies, which can be hampered by glycan heterogeneity. The crystal structure of Sig7b reveals a complete Man5-GlcNAc2 glycan N-linked to Asn-105 that is well defined in the electron density maps (Fig. 1). This high degree of order can be attributed to crystal packing. There are 3 hydrogen bonds between the glycan and the protein and an additional 16 hydrogen bonds between the glycan and symmetry-related protein molecules (Fig. 1). Thus, a total of 19 hydrogen bonds tether the glycan within the crystal lattice. Siglec-7, given its higher sequence identity with other members of the Siglec family as compared with sialoadhesin (Fig. 2), may provide a more suitable template for interpretation of structure-function relationships in the whole Siglec family. Despite the low sequence identity of Siglec-7 with sialoadhesin (Fig. 2), the structures share many common features and superpose with a root mean square deviation of 1.04 Å using 100 Cα atoms (Fig. 3). Siglec-7 shows an Ig-like fold based on a β-sandwich formed by two β-sheets consisting of strands A′GFCC′ and ABED, respectively. The G strand is split (forming G and G′), as is the A strand (to give A and A′). As with sialoadhesin, an intra-sheet disulfide is present (between Cys-46 and Cys-106), replacing the inter-sheet disulfide more commonly observed in other Ig-like folds (28Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Google Scholar). The cysteine on strand F is replaced by Phe-123, which lies 10 Å from Cys-46, farther than the 6–8-Å distance observed in other Ig domains (28Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Google Scholar). This results in a widening of the cleft between the sheets, exposing residues that may interact with ligand. The largest differences between the sialoadhesin and Siglec-7 structures occur in the flexible loops on the outside of the protein, namely the B-C and C-C′ loops, the latter of which is different in length (Figs. 2 and 3). The C-C′ loops of both Siglec structures extend away from the main body of the protein (Fig. 3).Figure 3Comparison of sialoadhesin, Siglec-7, and Siglec-9 structures. The crystal structures of sialoadhesin in complex with sialyllactose (Protein Data Bank entry 1QFO), the crystal structure of Siglec-7 (described here), and a model for Siglec-9 are shown in two representations. In A, the backbones are shown as ribbons with the side chains surrounding the ligand-binding site shown as sticks with orangecarbons. The C-C′ loop is highlighted in magenta. The two pyranose sugars from the sialyllactose ligand are shown assticks with green carbons. Hydrogen bonds with the protein are shown as black dotted lines.

For sialoadhesin, the two pyranose sugars of the ligand are shown in a sticks representation. The surface area corresponding to the C-C′ loop is highlightedby dashed circles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Despite repeated attempts with a range of ligands, either by soaking or by co-crystallization, a crystal of a Siglec-7-ligand complex could not be obtained. Although the structure of Sig7b was solved without a ligand in the binding site, comparison of the sialoadhesin structure with 3′-sialyllactose-bound (12May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Google Scholar) provides a model of the interactions that may occur and identifies the residues essential for specificity. The ligand-binding site lies between strands A and G (Figs. 3 and 4). As discussed previously, the partial opening of the β-sandwich, caused by the absence of the inter-sheet disulfide, provides a large flat surface onto which the ligand binds in the sialoadhesin structure (12May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Google Scholar). Compared with sialoadhesin, this surface has a more basic character in Sig7b, resulting from the additional basic residues Arg-23, Arg-120, and Lys-135 (Fig. 3). The additional positive charge presented by the binding face of Siglec-7 may provide a further docking site for a negatively charged sugar, possibly explaining the Siglec-7 preference for disialylated ligands. Comparison of the sialic acid-binding site of Siglec-7 and sialoadhesin show that many of the residues important in the interaction with sialic acid are conserved (Figs. 2 and 4). An arginine (Arg-124), conserved in all Siglecs, interacts with the carboxyl group on the terminal sialic acid sugar (Fig. 4). Trp-132 provides a hydrophobic interaction with the glycerol moiety. Protein backbone hydrogen bonding with the glycerol and N-acetyl groups seen in the sialoadhesin complex are also possible in the Siglec-7-binding site. However, there are some key differences. Sialoadhesin Trp-2 forms a hydrophobic contact with theN-acetyl methyl group. This tryptophan is replaced by Tyr-26 in Siglec-7, which could potentially hydrogen-bond with theN-acetyl carbonyl. In Siglec-9, this residue is absent. In sialoadhesin, mutation of the equivalent Trp-2 revealed that the hydrophobic interaction is important for N-acetyl neuraminic acid interactions (12May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Google Scholar). This could also explain why sialoadhesin cannot interact with N-glycoylneuraminic acid since the additional oxygen atom in the latter form of sialic acid would be expected to result in a steric clash (Fig. 4). Apart from sialoadhesin and MAG, all other siglecs examined so far, including hCD22, hCD33, and Siglec-6 (29Brinkman-Van der Linden E.C.M. Sjoberg E.R. Juneja L.R. Crocker P.R. Varki N. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8633-8640Google Scholar), can bind both N-acetyl andN-glycoylneuraminic acid, suggesting that the hydrophobic contact with the N-acetyl neuraminic acid may not be required for sialic acid recognition in all cases. This could also explain why Siglec-9 mediates robust sialic acid binding in the absence of an equivalent aromatic residue (2Angata T. Hingorani R. Varki N.M. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45128-45136Google Scholar, 15Yamaji T. Teranishi T. Alphey M.S. Crocker P.R. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6324-6332Google Scholar, 16Zhang J.Q. Nicoll G. Jones C. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22121-22126Google Scholar). An important aspect of Siglec function is the differential linkage specificity displayed by members of this family. This issue was recently addressed in a domain-swapping experiment between Siglec-7 and -9 (15Yamaji T. Teranishi T. Alphey M.S. Crocker P.R. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6324-6332Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this experiment showed that a single stretch of 6 amino acids in the tip of the C-C′ loop could confer Siglec-9-like binding specificity on Siglec-7. The comparison of sialoadhesin with Siglec-7 shows that in the latter, the C-C′ loop is longer and extends farther away from the body of the protein, offering the potential for more interactions with additional sugars (Figs. 3 and 4). In particular, the absence of an equivalent of sialoadhesin Tyr-44 in Siglec-7 creates a larger cavity and exposes the basic Lys-75 (Fig. 4). Sequence alignment shows that the C-C′ loop is variable in the Siglec family, and it is thus possible that interactions with specific side chains that extend toward the binding site for the second sugar are responsible for binding selectivity. For Siglec-7, these residues are represented by Asn-70, Ile-72, and Lys-75, whereas the equivalent residues in Siglec-9 are Ala-66, Thr-68, and Asp-71. Thus, from a structural point of view, it is possible that the linkage specificity displayed by Siglecs is due to the interaction of side chains in the C-C′ loop with subterminal sugars. Although Siglec-7 was crystallized in the absence of any carbohydrate ligands, the binding pocket is not empty. Expansion of the space group symmetry shows that the pocket is occupied by the A′-B loop and C terminus of a symmetry-related protein molecule (Fig. 5), burying a total surface area of 200 Å2. Comparison with sialic acid binding in sialoadhesin shows that the amide of Gln-37 mimics the interaction with the sialic acid glycerol side chain (Fig. 5). Met-40 has hydrophobic interactions with the Cβ of Lys-131 and Cα of Trp-132. In addition, there are several water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5). Although the interactions with the symmetry-related loop are not extensive, this is one of the few examples of a peptide occupying a carbohydrate-binding pocket (30Johnson M.A. Pinto B.M. Aust. J. Chem. 2002; 55: 13-25Google Scholar) and perhaps represents a first step toward a peptide-based Siglec-7 inhibitor. Interesting examples of a such peptide inhibitors have been described recently for family 18 chitinases (31Houston D.R. Shiomi K. Arai N. Omura S. Peter M.G. Turberg A. Synstad B.

Our results support previous predictions that sialic acid recognition by Siglecs is based on a common template and provide insights into the molecular basis of sialic acid linkage specificity exhibited by different Siglec family members. The structure presented here could be used as a template for the design of specific inhibitors, which could be used to dissect the precise role of CD33-related Siglecs in the regulation of leukocyte activation. Future studies will be aimed at elucidating the precise structural basis for sialic acid recognition by this family of mammalian lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1993274829,"In the present study, we have determined the nature and the kinetics of the cellular events triggered by the exposure of cells to non-fibrillar amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). When cortical neurons were treated with low concentrations of soluble Aβ (1–40), an early reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent cytoskeleton disruption precedes caspase activation. Indeed, caspase activation and neuronal cell death were prevented by the microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol. A perturbation of the microtubule network was noticeable after being exposed to Aβ for 1 h, as revealed by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Microtubule disruption and neuronal cell death induced by Aβ were inhibited in the presence of antioxidant molecules, such as probucol. These data highlight the critical role of ROS production in Aβ-mediated cytoskeleton disruption and neuronal cell death. Finally, using FRAP (fluorescence recoveryafter photo bleaching) analysis, we observed a time-dependent biphasic modification of plasma membrane fluidity, as early as microtubule disorganization. Interestingly, molecules that inhibited neurotubule perturbation and cell death did not affect the membrane destabilizing properties of Aβ, suggesting that the lipid phase of the plasma membrane might represent the earliest target for Aβ. Altogether our results convey the idea that upon interaction with the plasma membrane, the non-fibrillar Aβ induces a rapid ROS-dependent disorganization of the cytoskeleton, which results in apoptosis.

Alzheimer's disease amyloid-β 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole phosphate-buffered saline 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl))-sphingomyelin analysis of variance day in vitro, AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin fluoromethyketone 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein A common feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD),1the most common form of dementia, is the accumulation and the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), a 39- to 43-amino acid peptide derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (1Yankner B.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 921-932Google Scholar, 2Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399 Suppl. 6738: A23-A31Google Scholar). Although Aβ represents a key factor in AD (3Selkoe D.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 53: 438-447Google Scholar), the nature of the toxic form of Aβ early involved in AD pathology remains unclear. Whether it is the fibrillar or the non-fibrillar peptides that are the more deleterious remains a controversial issue (4Drouet B. Pincon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. Pillot T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 705-715Google Scholar). The amyloid cascade hypothesis causally links AD clinico-pathological process and neuronal cell death to the aggregation and deposition of Aβ (5Anderson A.J., Su, J.H. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1710-1719Google Scholar, 6Estus S. Tucker H.M. van Rooyen C. Wright S. Brigham E.F. Wogulis M. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7736-7745Google Scholar, 7Morishima Y. Gotoh Y. Zieg J. Barrett T. Takano H. Flavell R. Davis R.J. Shirasaki Y. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7551-7560Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis has been challenged by recent evidences indicating that the non-fibrillar Aβ also plays a major role in AD (8Michikawa M. Gong J.S. Fan Q.W. Sawamura N. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7226-7235Google Scholar, 9Mucke L. Masliah E., Yu, G.Q. Mallory M. Rockenstein E.M. Tatsuno G., Hu, K. Kholodenko D. Johnson-Wood K. McConlogue L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4050-4058Google Scholar). A recent elegant study has demonstrated that the fibrils from AD brain are composed of amyloid peptide moieties arranged at right angles to the backbone of the amyloid P protein wrapped in glycosaminoglycans (10Inoue S. Kuroiwa M. Kisilevsky R. Brain Res Rev. 1999; 29: 218-231Google Scholar). Thus, the fibrils are not simply made of chains of self-aggregated Aβ and do not comprise long chains of multimeric Aβ, similar to those used to evaluate the neurotoxicity of the fibrillar Aβ in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the synaptic loss in AD brain has been correlated with the soluble pool of Aβ peptides rather than the fibrillar one, implying that the non-fibrillar Aβ may be a crucial pathological factor in AD (11McLean C.A.

Several studies, based on the use of transgenic mice, have demonstrated that neurodegeneration and specific spatial learning deficits might occur without amyloid plaque formation (14Koistinaho M.

These results emphasize the necessity to clarify the initial response of neurons to the non-fibrillar Aβ and to identify the cellular targets involved in non-fibrillar Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Tailing with these observations, our studies and others rely on the hypothesis of a close association between neuronal loss and a proapoptotic effect of soluble forms of Aβ (18Pillot T. Drouet B.

Indeed, it has been established that the amphiphilic non-aggregated Aβ may intercalate into the plasma membrane of neurons, directly altering membrane activities and inducing neuronal cell death (18Pillot T.

Accumulative evidences have laid emphasis on the critical role of an oxidative stress in AD and in the neurotoxicity induced by Aβ (26Varadarajan S. Yatin S. Aksenova M. Butterfield D.A. J Struct Biol. 2000; 130: 184-208Google Scholar, 27Miranda S. Opazo C. Larrondo L.F. Munoz F.J. Ruiz F. Leighton F. Inestrosa N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 62: 633-648Google Scholar). However, most of the molecular mechanisms involved in the neuronal cell death induced by non-fibrillar forms of Aβ are yet to be characterized. The aim of the present paper was to identify the primary targets of the non-fibrillar Aβ and the chronology of the early cellular events involved in apoptotic neuronal cell death upon Aβ exposure. Microtubules fulfill a plethora of cellular functions, including axonal and dendritic growth and stability (28Sheetz M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 392-396Google Scholar, 29Baasm P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 29-36Google Scholar). We have proved recently that the non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40) induces apoptosis to rat cortical neurons (18Pillot T. Drouet B. Queillé S. Labeur C. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Pinçon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Google Scholar, 22Drouet B. Pinçon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. Pillot T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 758-769Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated whether the microtubule network could be an early cellular target for the non-fibrillar Aβ. We have demonstrated the following sequence: low concentrations of soluble Aβ (1–40), or of its shorter (29–40) C-terminal domain, induce apoptotic neuronal cell death by perturbing the fluidity of the plasma membrane, leading to a disruption of the neurotubule network depending on the induction of an early oxidative stress. Aβ (1–40), Aβ (29–40), the caspase substrate, and inhibitor peptides were purchased from Bachem, and DCFH-DA was from Molecular Probes. Unless otherwise indicated, materials used for cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen. The drug stabilizing cytoskeleton, taxol, and all other chemicals were of high purity grade from Sigma. To overcome problems of amyloid peptide solubility at high concentrations, fresh peptide stock solutions were prepared at 5 mg × ml−1 in hexafluoro-2-propanol (Sigma) as described previously (30Pillot T. Goethals M. Vanloo B. Talussot C. Brasseur R. Rosseneu M. Vandekerckhove J. Lins L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28757-28765Google Scholar). For the incubation of the peptides with the neurons, aliquots of peptide stock solution were quickly dried under nitrogen and directly solubilized at the experimental concentrations into the culture medium. Peptide solutions were then applied onto the cells. Under those conditions, all the amyloid peptides remained soluble for the determination of their neurotoxic properties (18Pillot T. Drouet B. Queillé S. Labeur C. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Pinçon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Google Scholar). Cortical neurons from embryonic day 16–17 Wistar rat fetuses were prepared as described previously (18Pillot T. Drouet B. Queillé S. Labeur C. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Pinçon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated cells were plated at 4.5–5.0 104cells/cm2 in plastic dishes pre-coated with poly-l-ornithine (1.5 μg × ml−1; Sigma). The cells were cultured in a chemically defined Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 medium free of serum (Invitrogen) and supplemented with insulin (5.10−7m), putrescine (60 μm), sodium selenite (30 nm), transferrin (100 μm), progesterone (1.10−7m), and 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin. Cultures were kept at 35 °C in a humidified 6% CO2atmosphere. After six to seven DIV, cortical population was determined to be at least 95% neuronal by immunostaining as described previously (18Pillot T. Drouet B. Queillé S. Labeur C. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Pinçon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Google Scholar, 31Keller J.N. Pang Z. Geddes J.W. Begley J.G. Germeyer A. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 273-284Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on six to seven DIV neurons. Cell viability was first determined by morphological observation and cell counting after 5 min of trypan blue staining (0.4%; Sigma) to evaluate membrane integrity, and the metabolic activity was assessed by the MTT reduction assay (18Pillot T. Drouet B. Queillé S. Labeur C. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Pinçon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Google Scholar, 22Drouet B. Pinçon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. Pillot T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 758-769Google Scholar). Moreover, the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium was assessed using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Cell nuclei were visualized using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). The cells, grown on a glass coverslips, were washed in PBS, incubated at room temperature for 10 min with DAPI (0.1 μg × ml−1), washed with PBS, and examined under a microscope equipped for epifluorescence. To evaluate the percentage of apoptotic cells, five independent fields of microscope were counted (around 100 cells) in three separate experiments, with two determinations each. Under control conditions, neuronal cells exhibited 12–15% of apoptotic cells at nine DIV. For experiments in the presence of caspase inhibitors, cells were incubated 2 h with 50 or 100 μm inhibitors before and throughout Aβ peptide exposure. Alternatively, DNA fragmentation was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of oligonucleosomes using a kit form purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Briefly, cortical neurons were plated in 24-well dishes (around 200.000 cells per well) and treated at seven DIV for 24 h with Aβ. After having been washed, the cells were lysed directly on wells, and oligonucleosomes were determined according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The caspase activities were measured by means of the cleavage of the substrates DEVD-pNA, YVAD-pNa, LEHD-AMC, and IEPD-AMC (Bachem). Briefly, at the indicated time points following peptide treatments, the cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 20 min on ice in a buffer of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin and leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm and assayed for protein by Bradford (Bio-Rad). 50 μg of proteins were incubated for 2 h with 100 μm caspase substrates initially dissolved in Me2SO. The cleavage of the caspase substrates was monitored by absorbance measurements at 405 nm for DEVD-pNA and YVAD-pNa and by fluorescence emission at 460 nm after exciting LEHD-AMC and IEPD-AMC at 360 nm, using a Fluostar reader plate (BMG-Labtechnologies). The measurement of cell oxidation is based on the oxidation of the non-fluorescent compounds, DCFH-DA, to a fluorescent derivative, DCF, in a peroxidase-mediated reaction. Increases in fluorescence emission reflect enhanced cellular oxidative stress. Briefly, treated cortical neurons were loaded with 100 μm DCFH-DA for 45 min. Before analysis, cells were washed three times in PBS, and DCF fluorescence was recorded directly on culture dishes by a Fluostar reader plate (BMG-Labtechnologies), using 488-nm excitation and 510-nm emission filters. Cortical neurons were fixed for 2 h at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% tannic acid in 0.1m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Then the neurons were postfixed for 2 h at 4 °C in 2% osmic acid in phosphate buffer. After having been dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, the samples were embedded in Epon resin (Poly/Bed 812; Polysciences, Warrington, PA), and ultra thin sections (70-nm) were obtained using a Reichert Ultracut. Thin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate, and lead citrate and examined with a Jeol 100CX microscope. For immunofluorescence studies, the neurons were cultured on glass coverslips that had been coated overnight with 15 μg/ml poly l-ornithine. Following the treatments, the neurons were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 made up in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and then incubated with a monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (1:500) (Chemicon) for 1 h under constant agitation. After several washes in PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1: 250) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed with PBS, labeled with DAPI as described above, and mounted in Fluoprep (BioMérieux). The microtubules were visualized with a Nikon microscope using a PlanFluor X40/1.3 objective. For semiquantitative analysis of microtubule organization, at least five microscope fields/condition were imaged using a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera, and microtubule organization in 100–120 cells/field was classified as normal, mildly disrupted, or severely disrupted. The cells were incubated for shorter times with Aβ (1–40) in Hanks' balanced salt solution at room temperature and loaded with 4 μm NBD-SM (1 mg/ml stock solution in chloroform). In the case of longer treatments (up to 24 h), the neurons were incubated with Aβ (1–40) in normal culture conditions, then rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and stained with the fluorescent lipid, and analyzed 10 min thereafter. The measurement of the lateral diffusion of the molecules in the membrane by means of FRAP (fluorescence recoveryafter photo bleaching) has already been described (32Blonk C.G. Don A. Van Aalst H. Birmingham J.J. J. Microscopy. 1992; 169: 363-374Google Scholar). A fluorescent probe, here a labeled lipid, was incorporated into the cell membranes. When a small defined area of the labeled membrane was photobleached by a high powerful laser pulse, the intensity of fluorescence was reduced immediately. As the fluorescent probe present in the vicinity underwent a constant diffusion motion, it diffused into the bleached area, gradually increasing the fluorescence intensity after bleaching. Thus, the kinetics of the fluorescent recovery depends on the diffusion rate of the probe, measured as the diffusion coefficient, D 20,w. Analyses were performed at 37 °C with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. We used the 488-nm line of a 25-milliwatt argon laser with a Zeiss C-Apochromat, ×63, numerical aperture 1.2, oil-immersion objective. The pinhole diameter was set to 1 airy unit, which correspond to a 1.2-μm depth of field, to reduce the contribution of cytoplasm fluorescence as much as possible. The area of bleaching was defined as a circle of 3.0-μm diameter, centered on an apical body cell membrane. The area was photobleached at full laser power (100% power, 100% transmission) for 230 ms. The extent of the bleaching typically reached 50 to 80%. Before bleaching, five images were monitored to define the initial fluorescence. The post-bleached images were scanned at 0.6% transmission with a delay of 100 ms during the last 60 s, resulting in a total acquisition of 80 points for 90 s, the time required to complete the maximum recovery of fluorescence. No photobleaching was observed during recovery. The sets of scans in which the fraction mobile of fluorophore was less than 65% or more than 110% and bleaching less than 35% were discarded. Cells presenting debris, heterogeneous labeling, or movements during scanning were not used for FRAP measurements.D 20,w parameters were calculated according to the method described by Kubitscheck et al.(33Kubitscheck U. Wedekind P. Peters R. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 948-956Google Scholar). STAT VIEW computer software was used for the statistical analysis. Most of the data were from three separate experiments with three to four determinations each. Values were expressed as means + S.E. Differences between control and treated groups were analyzed using Student's t test. Multiple pairwise comparisons among the groups of data were performed using ANOVA followed by a Scheffe's post hoc test. Statistical differences were determined at p < 0.05. To investigate the kinetics of microtubule network disorganization, cortical neurons were exposed to 5 μmsoluble Aβ (1–40) for short incubation times at the end of which no morphological feature of apoptosis (e.g. membrane bleeding, cell shrinkage, and chromatin condensation) was detected (see Figs.1 and 2). After a 3-h Aβ (1–40) exposure, we observe a dramatic perturbation of the neurotubule network in most of the neurites of the treated neurons (Fig. 1 c), as compared with the control cells in which neurotubules elongated within the neurites normally, in a parallel organization (Fig. 1 a). Similar results were obtained using the shorter Aβ (29–40) which displays also membrane perturbing properties (data not shown). These observations made through electron microscopy were confirmed using immunocytochemistry. In the control cells, a dense and constant microtubule network radiates from the cell bodies to the periphery (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast, in the cortical neurons treated with 5 μmnon-fibrillar Aβ (1–40) for 1 and 3 h (Fig. 2, C andD, respectively), we observed a peripheral fragmentation and loss of microtubules without any fragmentation or condensation of nuclear DNA (Fig. 2 C). Despite this severe microtubule disruption, the treated cells maintained their spreading shape, implying that the non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40) did not affect neurofilaments. Higher peptide concentrations or longer incubation times resulted in a more extensive and rapid loss of the microtubule network (not shown).Figure 2The non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40) peptide disrupts neuronal microtubules.Cortical neurons were incubated in the absence (A andB) or in the presence of 5 μm soluble Aβ (1–40) (C and D) for 1 and 3 h, respectively. The microtubule organization was visualized using immunofluorescence with an anti β-tubulin monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the kinetics of onset of the early microtubule perturbations induced by the non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40) and of the apoptotic neuronal cell death, we investigated the effects of taxol, a microtubule-stabilizing drug, on Aβ-induced cytoskeleton disruption and neurotoxicity. Cortical neurons incubated with 100 nm taxol only displayed a typical microtubule organization (Fig. 1, b and b′) as described previously (34Michaelis M.L. Ranciat N. Chen Y. Bechtel M. Ragan R. Hepperle M. Liu Y. Georg G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1623-1627Google Scholar). Interestingly, the non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40) was unable to disrupt the neuronal microtubule network in the cells preincubated for 2 h with 100 nm taxol before Aβ (1–40) addition (Fig. 1 D). These results have been confirmed using immunocytochemistry and with taxol being added to the cortical neurons at the same time as Aβ (1–40) (not shown). We next investigated the effects of taxol on non-fibrillar Aβ-induced neuronal cell death. As described previously (18Pillot T. Drouet B. Queillé S. Labeur C. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Pinçon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Google Scholar), the treatment of cortical neurons with 5 μm Aβ (1–40) resulted in a time-dependent decrease in cell viability monitored by the MTT assay (Fig. 3 A). Upon a 6-h exposure to Aβ (1–40), the MTT reduction level decreased significantly to 18.3% (p < 0.05) compared with the control level. Interestingly, whereas taxol alone displayed no effect on MTT even after 48 h of treatment, its presence protected the neurons against Aβ (1–40)-induced neurotoxicity (Fig. 3 A). After a 48-h exposure to Aβ in the presence of 100 nm taxol, the MTT reduction level remained at 82% of control, whereas the protective effects of taxol diminished after prolonged incubations. Moreover, the presence of taxol in the culture medium inhibited the release of lactate dehydrogenase after a 48-h Aβ (1–40) treatment (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that the stabilization of the microtubule organization by taxol prevents Aβ-induced neuronal cell death. In agreement with these morphological and biochemical observations, we demonstrated that taxol inhibited apoptosis induced by low concentrations of non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40). The apoptotic nuclei were visualized and quantified after DAPI staining of cultures treated with 5 μm Aβ (1–40) in the absence and presence of 100 nm taxol. Upon Aβ exposure, cortical neurons shared a time-dependent increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei, which was statistically different from control after 24 h of incubation and reached 58.6 + 3.1% (p < 0.001) after 48 h of incubation (Fig. 4 A). The presence of taxol in the culture medium almost completely inhibited the apoptotic cell death induced by Aβ (1–40) after a 24-h incubation, and the effects persisted for up to 48 h (23.4 + 2.5% of apoptotic nuclei) (Fig. 4 A). To further improve our results, we quantified the cytoskeleton perturbation induced by the non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40) using immunocytochemistry with an anti-β-tubulin antibody. The Aβ-induced microtubule disruption was time-dependent (Fig. 4 B). As early as 1 h after the addition of 5 μm soluble Aβ (1–40) to the cells, we observed a greater number of neurons exhibiting a mild disruption of microtubules (25.2 + 1.8%, p < 0.01). After a 3-h incubation, the microtubule network was mildly or severely disrupted in 35.2 + 3.5% (p < 0.001) of the treated cells, and almost all the neurons displayed disturbed microtubules after a 24-h incubation (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, the presence of taxol completely abolished microtubule perturbation induced by the non-fibrillar Aβ peptide (Fig. 4 B). These data strongly emphasize that early cytoskeleton disruption is required in the neuronal cell death induced by non-fibrillar Aβ peptide. Moreover, Fig. 4 C showed only few cells exhibiting both disorganized microtubules and apoptotic nuclei. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that microtubule perturbations precede, and might be involved in, a pathway leading to apoptosis upon soluble Aβ exposure. In a previous report, we demonstrated that the caspase 3 inhibitor, DEVD-CHO peptide, reduced neuronal cell death induced by the non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40) significantly (18Pillot T. Drouet B. Queillé S. Labeur C. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. Pinçon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Google Scholar). Here, we clearly show that the apoptotic cell death induced by non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40) requires the activation of caspases 3 and 9 by directly measuring caspase-like activity in the lysates of the treated cells (Fig. 5). The activity of caspases 3 and 9 increased significantly (p < 0.05 as compared with the control cells) after a 6-h incubation with 5 μm Aβ (1–40) (Fig. 5, A and D, respectively), whereas the activation of caspases 1 and 8 was not detected (Fig. 5,B and C, respectively). To establish a causative relationship between microtubule disruption and caspase activation, we performed kinetic experiments of microtubule perturbation in the absence and presence of caspase inhibitors (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 A demonstrates that both caspase inhibitors markedly reduced apoptosis induced by 5 μm non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40). However, unlike taxol, the caspase inhibitors had no effect on the early cytoskeleton perturbations induced by Aβ (1–40), even after a prolonged incubation (Fig. 6 B). Moreover, the presence of 100 nm taxol during Aβ exposure inhibited the activation of caspases 3 and 9 significantly (not shown). These results suggest that the microtubule perturbation might occur before caspase activation under treatment with non-fibrillar Aβ (1–40).Figure 6Effects of caspase inhibitors on soluble Aβ (1–40)-induced apoptosis and microtubule disruption. Cortical neurons were preincubated or not for 2 h with 100 μm caspase inhibitors and then treated for the indicated incubation time with 5 μmnon-fibrillar Aβ (1–40). Apoptotic nuclei were visualized and quantified after DAPI staining (A), and microtubule perturbations were quantified by immunofluorescence using an antibody against β-tubulin (B). Data are means (± S.E.) of three different experiments with four determinations each and are normalized to the effect of vehicle, designated as 100% (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001).

Studies showing that PCNA interacts with mispair-binding protein complexes, MSH2·MSH3 and MSH2·MSH6, and that PCNA enhances MSH2·MSH6 mispair binding specificity suggest PCNA may be involved in mispair recognition. Here we show that PCNA and MSH2·MSH6 form a stable ternary complex with a homoduplex (G/C) DNA, but MSH2·MSH6 binding to a heteroduplex (G/T) DNA disrupts MSH2·MSH6 binding to PCNA. We also found that the addition of ATP or adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) restores MSH2·MSH6 binding to PCNA, presumably by disrupting MSH2·MSH6 binding to the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA. These results support a model in which MSH2·MSH6 binds to PCNA loaded on newly replicated DNA and is transferred from PCNA to mispaired bases in DNA.

A number of potential functions of these sliding clamps have been postulated, although their exact role in MMR is not understood. The recognition of mispaired bases by the MutS family of proteins in vivo may be more complex than mispair recognition in vitro. Using MMR-defective mutants inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, one can calculate from spontaneous mutation rates in coding sequences like CAN1 andURA3, or even in rare hypermutable sequences, that MMR likely has the ability to recognize a single mispaired base per genome of ∼107 base pairs (4Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 9Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol.

It seems unlikely that a ∼30-fold affinity difference for mispairs versus base pairs can alone account for this in vivo MMR specificity. There are several other mechanisms that may contribute to the specificity of MMR. First, the MutS family of proteins forms complexes with other MMR proteins, and these complexes could have increased mispair specificity. Examples include the interaction of MSH2 with EXO1 (24Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Second, mispair binding by the MutS family proteins could drive mispair-specific conformational changes required for MMR. Examples include the assembly of MutL onto MutS at a mispair (6Schofield M.J.

Finally, the interaction between the MutS family proteins and either PCNA or the β clamp subunit of DNA polymerase III has suggested that MMR may be coupled to replication (25Clark A.B. Valle F.

Walker G.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Such coupling could occur either by targeting MMR proteins to regions of replicating DNA or by incorporating MMR proteins as part of the replication machinery. PCNA has been suggested to function in MMR at both an early step and during the DNA resynthesis step (35Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 36Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). One role of PCNA in MMR may be mediated by interactions between PCNA and the MSH2·MSH6 and MSH2·MSH3 complexes through PCNA interaction motifs present in MSH6 and MSH3 (25Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat.

Mutations that alter amino acids in these PCNA interaction motifs cause a partial MMR defect in vivo and eliminate the in vitro interaction between PCNA and the MSH2·MSH6 and MSH2·MSH3 complexes (25Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations in the gene encoding PCNA that cause MMR defects often eliminate thein vitro interaction between PCNA and the MSH2·MSH6 complex (26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Lau P.J. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6669-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PCNA increases the in vitromispair binding specificity of the MSH2·MSH6 complex, and this is eliminated by amino acid substitutions in PCNA that cause MMR defects (26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These results suggest PCNA may play a role in MMR at the mispair recognition step. To further understand the role of PCNA in mispair recognition, we investigated the mispair binding properties of the PCNA·MSH2·MSH6 complex. The results presented here demonstrate that the PCNA·MSH2·MSH6 complex can form a ternary complex with fully base-paired DNA, but when a mispair is present PCNA is excluded from the complex. These results suggest an in vivo model of mispair recognition whereby MSH2·MSH6 binds to PCNA on the DNA and is then transferred to the mispair. The DNA duplexes used in this study have been described previously (9Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol.

The annealed products were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography using a GEN-PAK FAX column (Waters Corp.) and then 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase if necessary. MSH2·MSH6 was purified using aS. cerevisiae overexpression system as described previously (8Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Marsischky G.T.

Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). All protein preparations were greater than 98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. Sedimentation analysis was performed as described previously (26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Lau P.J. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6669-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In brief, protein samples (80 μl) were loaded onto the top of 4-ml, 15–30% glycerol gradients and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 h in a Beckman SW60 rotor. Thirty-one fractions were collected from the bottom of each gradient. The amount of radioactivity present in 15 μl of each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Aliquots (12.5 μl) of selected fractions were used for subsequent Western blot analysis. Alternatively, 127 μl of each fraction was concentrated using a Microcon YM 30 Centrifugal Filter (Millipore Corp.) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4–15% gradient gels, which were subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue. The following amounts of proteins or DNAs (individually or mixtures thereof) were incubated on ice for 30 min and sedimented through the gradients: 7.5 μg of MSH2·MSH6, 2.5 μg of PCNA, 680 ng of G/C DNA plus 3.7 ng of γ-32P-labeled G/C DNA, 680 ng of G/T DNA plus 3.7 ng of γ-32P-labeled G/T DNA. PCNA was biotinylated according to the ECL protein biotinylation kit (Amersham Biosciences). MSH2·MSH6 (1.5 pmol of heterodimer) and biotinylated PCNA (1.5 pmol of homotrimer) was mixed with either no DNA, G/T DNA, or G/C DNA in buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% (octylphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol (Sigma)) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The total reaction volume was 40 μl, and the amounts of DNA added are indicated in individual experiments. For each reaction, 80 μl (40 μl of settled resin) of streptavidin-agarose (Novagen) was washed once in buffer A and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 1 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the reaction mixture was added to the streptavidin-agarose. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min with gentle mixing every 5 min. The agarose beads were then washed three times by centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min at 4 °C followed by resuspension in 40 μl of buffer A. After the last resuspension, SDS loading buffer was added to the mixture, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 95 °C. 15 μl of the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For the precipitation experiments with and without nucleotide, MSH2·MSH6 (1.5 pmol of heterodimer) and biotinylated PCNA (1.5 pmol of homotrimer) was mixed with either no DNA, G/T DNA (7.5 pmol), or G/C DNA (7.5 pmol) in buffer A or buffer A supplemented with either ATP (250 μm) or ATPγS (250 μm). Protein samples were transferred to immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol and analyzed by Western blotting essentially as described previously using polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against either full-length MSH2, MSH6, or PCNA (26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and the ECL Plus protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting films were quantified by densitometry. Using sedimentation analysis, earlier studies showed that the MSH2·MSH6 protein complex interacted with wild-type PCNA but did not interact with several MMR-defective mutant PCNAs to the extent seen with wild-type PCNA (26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Lau P.J. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6669-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we studied the interactions between MSH2·MSH6, PCNA, and either homoduplex or heteroduplex DNA. As observed previously (26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Lau P.J. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6669-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the addition of PCNA to MSH2·MSH6 caused MSH2·MSH6 to sediment further into the gradient (lower fraction numbers) than MSH2·MSH6 alone (Fig. 1 A). PCNA alone was found in fractions 17 and above, whereas addition of MSH2·MSH6 caused PCNA to sediment further into the gradient such that PCNA was now observed in the same fractions as the shifted MSH2·MSH6 (Fig. 1 B). This shift of MSH2·MSH6 and PCNA to larger sedimentation coefficients is consistent with the formation of a MSH2·MSH6·PCNA complex (26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Lau P.J. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6669-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Addition of either homoduplex (G/C) or heteroduplex (G/T) DNA to MSH2·MSH6 caused both MSH2·MSH6 and the DNA to sediment at a larger sedimentation coefficient than either MSH2·MSH6 (Fig. 1 A) or the DNA alone (Fig. 1, C and D) (the peak fraction for each DNA sedimented alone was fraction 25). This is consistent with previous observations that MSH2·MSH6 can bind to oligonucleotide duplexes that do or do not contain mispaired bases (7Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R.

The addition of PCNA to either homoduplex (G/C) or heteroduplex (G/T) DNA did not alter the sedimentation of either PCNA (Fig. 1 B) or the DNA (Fig. 1, C and D). This is consistent with the observation that PCNA does not stably bind to linear DNA (26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When MSH2·MSH6, PCNA, and the homoduplex (G/C) DNA were combined and sedimented, MSH2·MSH6 (Fig. 1 A), PCNA (Fig. 1 B), and the homoduplex (G/C) DNA (Fig. 1 C) all sedimented further into the gradient than observed with any combination of two. These results suggest that MSH2·MSH6, PCNA, and the homoduplex (G/C) DNA can form a stable complex. Interestingly, the same results were not seen when MSH2·MSH6, PCNA, and the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA were combined and sedimented. Under these conditions, MSH2·MSH6 (Fig. 1 A) and the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA (Fig. 1 D) co-sedimented to the same position as the preformed MSH2·MSH6·heteroduplex (G/T) DNA complex, while all of the PCNA appeared to sediment to the same position as PCNA alone. Moreover, no PCNA was observed in the fractions containing the MSH2·MSH6·heteroduplex (G/T) DNA complex (as observed by staining with Coomassie Blue). The inability to observe co-sedimentation of PCNA with the MSH2·MSH6·heteroduplex (G/T) DNA complex was independent of the order of addition of the proteins and DNA, including preincubation of MSH2·MSH6 with PCNA prior to the addition of the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA (data not shown). These results suggest that when an MSH2·MSH6·PCNA complex binds to the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA, PCNA is excluded from the complex. To substantiate these findings, Western blotting was used to provide more sensitive detection of PCNA (Fig. 2). After sedimentation and fractionation of reactions that contain PCNA, MSH2·MSH6, and a DNA (either G/C or G/T), peak fractions (fractions 11 and 12) that contain MSH2·MSH6 and DNA were analyzed to detect PCNA. The same fractions from reactions containing PCNA mixed with MSH2·MSH6 or PCNA mixed with either the homoduplex (G/C) or the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA were analyzed as controls. PCNA was present in the two fractions when MSH2·MSH6 or MSH2·MSH6 and the homoduplex (G/C) DNA were incubated with PCNA prior to sedimentation. However, PCNA was not detected when either the homoduplex (G/C) DNA alone, the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA alone, or MSH2·MSH6 with the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA were incubated with PCNA prior to sedimentation. This strengthens the above finding that PCNA forms a complex with MSH2·MSH6 and homoduplex (G/C) DNA but not with MSH2·MSH6 and heteroduplex (G/T) DNA. Co-precipitation experiments were performed to analyze the formation of MSH2·MSH6·PCNA·DNA complexes. Biotinylated PCNA was incubated with MSH2·MSH6 and either no DNA or increasing amounts of the homoduplex (G/C) DNA or the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA. The resulting complexes were then precipitated with streptavidin-agarose, and the bound proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The addition of the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA caused a large decrease in the amount of MSH2 and MSH6 that co-precipitated with the biotinylated PCNA (Fig. 3 A); the amount of MSH2 and MSH6 bound was reduced by ∼70% compared with the levels observed when no DNA was added. In contrast, the addition of the homoduplex (G/C) DNA caused a small ∼10% decrease in the amount of MSH2 and MSH6 that co-precipitated with the biotinylated PCNA compared with no added DNA (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that the addition of the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA causes MSH2·MSH6 to partition into MSH2·MSH6·DNA complexes thus inhibiting the formation of MSH2·MSH6·PCNA complexes, whereas the addition of homoduplex DNA does not appear to inhibit the formation of MSH2·MSH6·PCNA complexes to the same extent. Co-precipitation experiments were also used to examine the effect of ATP and ATPγS on the interactions between PCNA and MSH2·MSH6 in the presence or absence of a DNA. When there was no DNA present, the addition of ATP or ATPγS caused only a small ∼10% decrease in the amount of MSH2 and MSH6 that co-precipitated with the biotinylated PCNA when compared with samples with no nucleotide added (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of the homoduplex (G/C) DNA, the addition of ATP and ATPγS caused a small ∼15 or 19% increase, respectively, in the amount of MSH2 or MSH6 bound to PCNA compared with reactions with no nucleotide added (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA, the addition of ATP or ATPγS caused a larger increase, ∼70 and ∼90%, respectively, in the amount of MSH2 and MSH6 that co-precipitated with the biotinylated PCNA compared with samples with no nucleotide added. It has been shown that addition of ATP or ATPγS to MSH2·MSH6 in the presence or absence of PCNA causes MSH2·MSH6 to dissociate from heteroduplex DNA (7Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R.

Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the idea that when ATP or ATPγS is added to mixtures containing MSH2·MSH6, PCNA, and the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA, MSH2·MSH6 has a lower affinity for the heteroduplex (G/T) DNA thereby increasing the MSH2·MSH6 available to complex with PCNA. In the present study, we observed that MSH2·MSH6 and MSH2·MSH6·PCNA complexes each formed a complex with homoduplex (G/C) DNA and that MSH2·MSH6 formed a complex with heteroduplex (G/T) DNA. In contrast to the results observed with homoduplex (G/C) DNA, when MSH2·MSH6, PCNA, and heteroduplex (G/T) DNA were incubated together, only an MSH2·MSH6·heteroduplex (G/T) DNA complex was obtained. Consistent with this, heteroduplex (G/T) DNA inhibited the formation of a co-precipitable MSH2·MSH6·PCNA complex, whereas homoduplex (G/C) DNA had essentially no effect on the formation of a co-precipitable MSH2·MSH6·PCNA complex. These results indicate that the MSH2·MSH6·PCNA complex can bind nonspecifically to DNA, but when MSH2· MSH6 binds to a mispair, binding of PCNA to MSH6 is disrupted. This suggests that either binding to a mispair alters the conformation of MSH2·MSH6 such that MSH6 cannot strongly interact with PCNA or that the position of the mispaired DNA within the MSH2·MSH6 ring may exclude PCNA from the complex. To gain further insight into this observation, we are developing approaches to analyze the structure of MSH2·MSH6· PCNA·DNA complexes and are analyzing the effect of other MMR proteins on complex formation. In previous studies using gel mobility shift assays, we observed that addition of PCNA to MSH2·MSH6 increased mispair binding specificity of MSH2· MSH6 but did not alter the mobility of the mispair·MSH2·MSH6 complex, whereas the nonspecific protein·DNA complexes formed often had a somewhat reduced mobility and a more heterogeneous nature (see Fig. 3E of Ref. 26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the conformational changes that occur during the transition between the nonspecific MSH2·MSH6·PCNA·DNA complex and the MSH2·MSH6·mispair complex in which PCNA is excluded may modestly improve mispair binding specificity. A number of studies have shown that the MSH2·MSH6 and MSH2·MSH3 heterodimers bind to PCNA through a conserved motif found in MSH6 and MSH3 and that these interactions are important for MMR (25Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These observations provide molecular insights into how PCNA might function at an early step in MMR and suggest that PCNA may play a role in mispair recognition. Three different types of models have been proposed for how PCNA might function early in MMR (25Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat.

Biol. 2002; 22: 6669-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). First, it has been suggested that because a PCNA trimer has three distinct protein docking sites, PCNA may assemble a higher order complex containing both MMR and replication proteins at replicating regions of DNA. However, analysis of the interaction of multiple proteins with PCNA has indicated that one PCNA-interacting protein displaces a second from PCNA rather than assembling into a complex with more than one protein bound to PCNA (39Levin D.S.

A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Second, it has been suggested that MSH2·MSH6 and MSH2·MSH3 form sliding clamps at mispairs that migrate to the replication DNA polymerase and induce dissociation of the replication complex (27Kleczkowska H.E. Marra G. Lettieri T. Jiricny J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Constraints on this model are that it needs a mechanism by which the MSH2·MSH6 and MSH2·MSH3 clamps can catch up to the rapidly progressing DNA polymerase and then overcome the structural barrier of encountering PCNA on the opposite face on which it is thought to bind (28López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 44Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Finally, because PCNA is naturally loaded onto 3′-primer termini in replication intermediates and is then left on the DNA when replication proteins dissociate (45Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), PCNA would be expected to decorate replicating regions of DNA. This could then target MSH2·MSH6 and MSH2·MSH3 to replicating regions of DNA (26Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) as has been suggested for other proteins (46Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 236-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism would target the MSH2·MSH6 and MSH2·MSH3 mispair recognition proteins to newly replicated regions of DNA where mispaired bases would normally be found. Our findings support this latter hypothesis and are consistent with a model where MSH2·MSH6 associates with PCNA that is tethered to DNA to form a nonspecific PCNA·MSH2·MSH6·PCNA complex, and once this complex encounters a mispair, the MSH2·MSH6 is transferred from PCNA to the mispair, thus activating MMR. Such a mechanism would increase the intracellular mispair recognition affinity of MSH2·MSH6 at newly replicated DNA.

From most sources, the enzyme is composed of two polypeptide subunits, α (35–44 kDa) and β (24–28 kDa), which combine to form an α2β2 tetramer (for review, see Refs. 1Allende J.E. Allende C.C.

CKII recognizes Ser/Thr (or in exceptional cases Tyr) (5Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Google Scholar) in an acidic environment (2Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Google Scholar). CKII phosphorylates a broad spectrum of endogenous substrates involved in transcription, translation, signal transduction, and other functions. Cdc37 was initially isolated in a genetic screen for mutants defective in progression through Start (6Reed S.I. Genetics. 1980; 95: 561-577Google Scholar). Cdc37 function is required for the proper association of Cdc28 (yeast CDK1) with both G1 and mitotic cyclins, thus demonstrating a role for Cdc37 in G2/M progression as well (7Gerber M.R. Farrell A. Deshaies R.J. Herskowitz I. Morgan D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4651-4655Google Scholar). Additional cdc37mutants generated by Dey et al. (8Dey B. Lightbody J.J. Boschelli F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1405-1417Google Scholar) arrest in both G1 and G2/M when shifted to restrictive temperature. CDC37 interacts genetically with several different protein kinases that are involved in diverse cellular roles. The list of genetic interactors of CDC37 includeCDC28 (7Gerber M.R. Farrell A. Deshaies R.J. Herskowitz I. Morgan D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4651-4655Google Scholar), KIN28 (9Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 535-544Google Scholar), mammalian v-Src when expressed in yeast (8Dey B. Lightbody J.J. Boschelli F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1405-1417Google Scholar), MPS1 (10Schutz A.R. Giddings T.H., Jr. Steiner E. Winey M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 969-982Google Scholar), STE11 (11Abbas-Terki T. Donze O. Picard D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 111-116Google Scholar), and CAK1 (12Farrell A. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 749-754Google Scholar). Consistent with the genetic results in yeast, mammalianCDC37 was found to encode the p50 subunit of an Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex that exhibits specificity for protein kinases (13Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Google Scholar). Although Hsp90 recognizes a diverse collection of client proteins, including steroid receptors, protein kinases, and others, Cdc37/Hsp90 complexes appear to interact exclusively with the catalytic subunit of protein kinases, with one notable exception (14Fliss A.E. Fang Y. Boschelli F. Caplan A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2501-2509Google Scholar, 15Silverstein A.M. Grammatikakis N. Cochran B.H. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20090-20095Google Scholar). Binding sites for the protein kinase client and for Hsp90 have been mapped to the N- and C-terminal regions of Cdc37, respectively (13Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Google Scholar, 15Silverstein A.M. Grammatikakis N. Cochran B.H. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20090-20095Google Scholar,16Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Google Scholar), providing further support for the notion that Cdc37 functions as a kinase-targeting co-chaperone of Hsp90. Cdc37 has also been demonstrated to possess chaperone activity on its own, independent of Hsp90 (17Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Google Scholar). We show here that the CKII/Cdc37 connection is unique among the known interactions between Cdc37 and protein kinases because the highly conserved N terminus of Cdc37 contains an evolutionarily conserved CKII consensus site that is phosphorylated by CKII in vivo. Further, CKII and Cdc37 constitute a positive feedback loop. Although Hsp90 inhibition reduces CKII function in vivo, Cdc37 and not Hsp90 is the limiting factor in maintaining CKII function. We also present genetic evidence that CKII-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc37 is essential for the ability of the latter to maintain the activity of multiple protein kinases involved in diverse cellular functions. This reveals a previously unsuspected role for CKII in regulating the activity of diverse protein kinases (via Cdc37 phosphorylation). S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast strains were grown in rich glucose medium (YPD: 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or in supplemented minimal medium (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar) at different temperatures as indicated in figure legends. Eviction ofURA3-marked plasmids was accomplished by plating cells on supplemented minimal medium containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (Diagnostic Chemicals Ltd.). Sporulation was carried out in liquid sporulation medium (1% potassium acetate, 0.1% yeast extract, and 0.5% glucose). Geldanamycin (GA),1 purchased from Sigma, was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to warm medium soon after autoclaving. Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Clontech) was grown in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin.Table IS. cerevisiae strainsStrainGenotypeSourceYDH6MAT a ade2-101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys2-801 trp1-Δ1 ura3-52 cka1-Δ1∷HIS3 cka2-Δ1∷TRP1 [pRS315CKA2](28Hanna D.E.

Open table in a new tab The temperature-sensitive strain YDH13 (Table I) was transformed via the spheroplast method (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar) with 10–20 μg of an S. cerevisiae genomic library in multicopy vector YEp24 (19Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Google Scholar) and plated on CM medium lacking uracil and leucine. Plates were incubated at 23 °C for 24 h to allow accumulation of gene products expressed from YEp24 and then placed at 35 °C (2 °C above the maximum permissive temperature of YDH13). YEp24-based suppressor plasmids were isolated by transforming E. coli strain SK1108 to ampicillin resistance with DNA-containing extracts prepared from each suppressor strain (20Strathern J.N. Higgins D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 319-329Google Scholar). That suppression was plasmid-linked was confirmed by retransformation of YDH13, and the relevant gene was identified by similarly testing various subclones. Among the genes identified in the screen was CDC37. The correct assignment in this case was confirmed by constructing a frameshift mutation (an additional GATC sequence) at theBglII site in the CDC37 open reading frame. This construct is predicted to encode a severely truncated product of 120 residues and fails to suppress YDH13. Site-directed mutations in CDC37 were prepared by the general method of Deng and Nickoloff (21Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar). A 3.3-kbBamHI/KpnI fragment containing the gene was subcloned into pUC19 to serve as a template. cdc37-S14,17Awas prepared using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) according to instructions from the manufacturer; cdc37-S14A, cdc37-S17A, andcdc37-S14,17E were prepared using the equivalent Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The four mutagenic oligonucleotides were: cdc37-S14,17A, 5′-GGATAAAATTGAACTAGCAGATGATGCTGATGTCGAGG-3′; cdc37-S14A, 5′-GGATAAAATTGAACTAGCAGATGATTCTGATGTCG-3′; cdc37-S17A, 5′-GAACTATCAGATGATGCTGATGTCGAGGTGC-3′; cdc37-S14,17E, 5′-GGATAAAA- TTGAACTAGAAGATGATGAAGATGTCGAGGTGCA-3′. The nucleotide changes for each mutation are underlined. The entire coding region of each mutant was sequenced to confirm that only the desired mutation was introduced. For expression in yeast, the wild-type and each mutant insert (BamHI/KpnI fragment) were subcloned into BamHI/KpnI-digested single-copy vectors pRS314 (TRP1) and pRS316 (URA3) (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) and multicopy vector pRS426 (URA3) (23Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Google Scholar). Strains carrying the above mutations as the only CDC37allele were constructed as follows. CDC37 (in pRS316) was introduced into a diploid yeast strain (gift from David Morgan) carrying a LEU2-marked deletion in one copy of theCDC37 gene (7Gerber M.R. Farrell A. Deshaies R.J. Herskowitz I. Morgan D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4651-4655Google Scholar). The resultant strain was sporulated, and haploid progeny that were auxotrophic for leucine and uracil (i.e. cdc37 null and rescued by wild-typeCDC37 on pRS316) were selected for further manipulation. After selection of a haploid strain with the a mating type, cells were transformed with CDC37, cdc37-S14,17A,cdc37-S14A, cdc37-S17A, andcdc37-S14,17E (all on pRS314). Transformants were plated twice in succession on minimal medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to evict the URA3-marked plasmid, yielding strains YSB11 through YSB15, respectively (Table I). All strains were tested for growth at a range of temperatures from 23 to 38 °C. The α and β subunits of Drosophila melanogaster CKII were expressed from the single-copy vector pBM272 under control of theGAL1,10 promoter, as described previously (24Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Google Scholar). Overexpression of Hsc82 or Hsp82 was achieved with multicopy YEp24 plasmids (gift of Kevin Morano) expressing each gene under control of its own promoter (25Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Google Scholar). Five A 600 units of cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended to a total volume of 100 μl by addition of sterile deionized water, and stored at −80 °C. Thawed cell suspensions were mixed rapidly with 100 μl of boiling 2× SDS sample buffer, vortexed, and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. After heat treatment, the samples were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min, and the clarified supernatants were stored at −20 °C. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon). Immunodetection was performed using the Amplified Alkaline Phosphatase Immun-Blot kit (Bio-Rad). Mouse monoclonal anti-Cdc37 (gift from Avrom Caplan, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) was used at 1:1500 dilution, rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdc37 at 1:3000 dilution (gift of Steve Reed, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:1000 dilution, and rabbit anti-Fpr3 (gift from Jeremy Thorner, University of California, Berkeley, CA) at 1:1500 dilution. Strains were grown in YPD to mid-log phase at 26 °C, and aliquots containing 5A 600 units of cells were removed, labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (500 μCi/sample) for 2.5 h at 26 or 37 °C, harvested, and washed in water. Protein extracts were prepared as above, except that extracts were adjusted to 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate (to trap SDS in mixed micelles) prior to incubation with 1 μl of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against Cdc37 (gift of David Morgan, University of California, San Francisco, CA) (7Gerber M.R. Farrell A. Deshaies R.J. Herskowitz I. Morgan D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4651-4655Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described by Cardenas et al. (26Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%), and labeled Cdc37 was visualized with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Strains were grown to mid-log phase at 23 °C and fixed by addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 3.7%. Cell morphology was visualized using Nomarski optics. For generation of growth curves, saturated cultures of the relevant strains were inoculated into fresh YPD at a starting concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml. Cultures were grown at 23 °C with vigorous shaking at 450 rpm. To determine cell number, aliquots were removed at the indicated times, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and counted in a hemacytometer. Steady-state Tyr phosphorylation of Fpr3 in the absence of Ptp1 function was used as an assay for CKII activity in vivo (5Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Google Scholar). Deletion ofPTP1 was carried out by the PCR method of Wach et al. (27Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Google Scholar). Two primers were used to amplify the kanamycin resistance gene from pFA-6A (gift of Peter Philippsen, Biozentrum, Switzerland) together with flanking sequences derived from the immediately upstream and downstream regions of PTP1. The forward primer used was 5′-CAAGAAAAGCGTTTGTTAGTAGTAGTTTGCGACAGTGGAGCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC-3′, and the reverse primer used was 5′-TATTGAAAAAATGCACAATTAGGAACTTTTATATAGCTGTATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG-3′ (PTP1 flanking sequences underlined). Disruptions were verified by PCR. To assay steady-state Tyr phosphorylation of Fpr3, isogenic wild-type and mutant strains were routinely grown in minimal medium to mid-log phase at 23 °C. For experiments involving GAL-regulated overexpression of Drosophila CKII, strains were grown at 30 °C in 2% raffinose medium lacking uracil. Early log phase cultures were shifted to 37 °C for 3 h, adjusted to 2% galactose to induce CKII expression, and incubated for an additional 3 h. To assay Tyr phosphorylation of Fpr3 at different cell cycle stages, cultures of YSB48 (Table I) were first grown in YPD to mid-log phase at 25 °C. Cultures were then adjusted to 10 μg/ml α-factor (4 h), 0.1 m hydroxyurea (5 h), or 30 μg/ml benomyl (4 h) to promote arrest in the G1, S, or G2/M phases of the cell cycle, respectively. Tyr-phosphorylated Fpr3 was detected by Western blotting as described above. To identify genes which interact genetically with CKII inS. cerevisiae, we utilized strain YDH13 (TableI) to screen for multicopy suppressors of the temperature-sensitive cka2 allele,cka2-13 ts (28Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Google Scholar). The screen was carried out at the minimum restrictive temperature of 35 °C, and one of the suppressor plasmids identified encoded the protein kinase-specific (co-)chaperone, Cdc37 (Fig. 1 A). MulticopyCDC37 also suppressed the slow growth rate at permissive temperature and flocculation displayed by YDH13 (data not shown).CDC37 suppressed four othercka2 ts alleles (data not shown), as well as two alleles of the CKA1 gene, encoding the α subunit ofS. cerevisiaeCKII. 2A. Rethinaswamy and C. V. C. Glover, unpublished data. Because Cdc37 has been shown to act as a chaperone either by itself (17Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Google Scholar) or in concert with Hsp90 (13Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Google Scholar), we assessed the effect(s) of GA, an Hsp90-specific inhibitor, on cka2-13 mutants. GA is a member of the benzoquinoid ansamycin family of antibiotics that binds Hsp90 within a conserved pocket that constitutes the nucleotide binding site of Hsp90, and inhibits Hsp90 ATPase activity (29Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Google Scholar, 30Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P.

GA has been shown to indirectly inhibit a variety of oncogenic tyrosine kinases and other substrates of Hsp90 including mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor (32Uehara Y. Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Kawai S. Virology. 1988; 164: 294-298Google Scholar, 33Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G., De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Refolding of denatured firefly luciferase by the Hsp90 chaperone complex is also inhibited by treatment with ansamycins (37Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Google Scholar). GA has been shown to inhibit Hsp90 function in vivo in yeast as well (25Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Google Scholar). In contrast to human cell lines, which are sensitive to GA at nanomolar concentrations, the growth of wild-type yeast is unimpaired even at concentrations of 2 mm GA (25Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Google Scholar). We have also found similar results with strains wild-type for CKII activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 B, cka2-13 mutants were sensitive to 35 μm GA at 23 °C (permissive temperature). Moreover, this sensitivity was suppressible byCDC37 overexpression. As might be expected, overexpression of the yeast homologs of Hsp90, HSC82 or HSP82(which are the targets of GA in yeast; Refs. 25Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Google Scholar and 31Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Google Scholar), also suppressed the GA sensitivity of cka2-13 mutants. A mutant allele of the yeast heat shock factor, hsf1–583, was marginally sensitive to GA at this temperature (used as a positive control) (25Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Google Scholar), whereas yeast that are wild-type for CKII were unaffected. CDC37 overexpression suppressed the GA sensitivity of cka2-13 mutants at temperatures from 21 to 34 °C (lowest and highest temperatures tested; data not shown). The minimum restrictive temperature for cka2-13 mutants is 35 °C, and the fact that they do not grow even at 21 °C in the presence of GA emphasizes the importance of Hsp90 function for the survival of cka2-13 mutants. Consistent with the reported effects of GA on protein kinases in mammalian cells, treatment ofcka2-13 cells with GA was found to cause decreased steady-state levels of CKII-dependent phosphorylation of Fpr3 (Fig. 1 C; see below for a discussion of this assay). We therefore conclude that, upon prolonged incubation ofcka2-13 cells with GA, CKII activity drops below a critical threshold causing these cells to die. CDC37 overexpression has been shown to suppress the temperature-sensitivity of hsp90 mutants in an allele-specific manner (17Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Cdc37 enhances Hsp90 function in vivo in S. cerevisiae. Alternatively or in addition, Cdc37 might function independently of Hsp90 to protect one or more critical targets from denaturation in anhsp90 mutant background. Given the GA sensitivity ofcka2-13 mutants, we sought to determine whether suppression of cka2-13 by CDC37 was mediated via Hsp90. To explore the general relationship between Cdc37 and Hsp90 in yeast, we made use of the previously reported observation thathsf1–583 cells are sensitive to GA because of reduced Hsp90 expression (25Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Google Scholar, 38Morano K.A. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5953-59562Google Scholar). If Cdc37 enhances Hsp90 function, CDC37overexpression might be expected to suppress the GA sensitivity of anhsf1–583 mutant. As shown in Fig. 2 A, overexpression ofCDC37 did not enhance the ability of hsf1–583mutants to grow in the presence of GA at either 25 or 30 °C. This result suggests that CDC37 overexpression does not enhance Hsp90 function (or expression) in vivo. To determine whether the ability of CDC37 to suppress the GA sensitivity ofcka2-13 mutants might be mediated via an increase in Hsp90 function, we tested whether direct overexpression of HSC82or HSP82 could rescue the temperature sensitivity of acka2-13 strain. As shown in Fig. 2 B, neither gene is able to suppress this mutant under conditions where CDC37is an effective suppressor. The above results make it unlikely that CDC37 overexpression suppresses the GA sensitivity of a cka2-13 strain by enhancing Hsp90 function. One possibility is that Cdc37 is itself an independent chaperone of CKII, a conclusion consistent with the ability of purified Cdc37 to protect CKII activity in vitro (17Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Google Scholar). However, this interpretation does not explain the fact thatcka2-13 mutants are sensitive to GA (Fig. 1 B), which implies that Hsp90 function is required for CKII activity. An alternative possibility is thus that Hsp90 and Cdc37 are both required for CKII activity, possibly as a functional complex, but that Cdc37 is the limiting component (overexpression of Cdc37 but not Hsp90 suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a cka2-13 strain). A similar conclusion has been reached regarding the nature of the Cdc37/Hsp90 relationship with a temperature-sensitive mutant of the Hck kinase in human cells (39Scholz G. Hartson S.D. Cartledge K. Hall N. Shao J. Dunn A.R. Matts R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6984-6995Google Scholar). Because our results were consistent with the possibility that Cdc37 is the limiting factor in the maintenance of CKII function, we decided to characterize further the nature of the CKII/Cdc37 relationship. Alignment of Cdc37 sequences from diverse organisms revealed an evolutionarily conserved CKII phosphorylation motif near the N terminus of the protein (see Fig. 4 A). All available Cdc37 sequences conserve a potential CKII phosphorylation site at Ser-14 (S. cerevisiae numbering), and the fungal sequences share a second potential site at Ser-17. Residue 17 represents the important +3 determinant of the Ser-14 site, and this is potentially satisfied by a phospho-Ser residue in the fungal species or by a glutamate in the others. Consistent with these facts, yeast Cdc37 has been shown to be a substrate of mammalian CKIIin vitro (17Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Google Scholar). The above data suggest that Cdc37 may be an in vivosubstrate of CKII. To test this possibility, we examined Cdc37 phosphorylation in vivo via metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation in wild-type versus CKII-deficient strains. Western blotting revealed that these strains had comparable Cdc37 levels (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 (lanes 1–4), Cdc37 is radiolabeled in vivo in wild-type cells and also in acka1Δ CKA2 strain, at b"

As a step toward further elucidating the mechanism of action of these cytokines in T-cell biology, we compared the gene expression profiles of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 in T cells using cDNA microarrays. IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 each induced a highly similar set of genes, whereas IL-4 induced distinct genes correlating with differential STAT protein activation by this cytokine. One gene induced by IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 but not IL-4 was dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5). In IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells, we show that IL-2-induced ERK-1/2 activity was inhibited by wild type DUSP5 but markedly increased by an inactive form of DUSP5, suggesting a negative feedback role for DUSP5 in IL-2 signaling. Our findings provide insights into the shared versus distinctive actions by different members of the γc family of cytokines. Moreover, we have identified a DUSP5-dependent negative regulatory pathway for MAPK activity in T cells.

Nature Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These cytokines have both redundant and distinctive actions on lymphocytes. IL-2 is a growth and survival factor for activated T lymphocytes and is also essential for activation-induced cell death (AICD) and the prevention of T cell anergy, processes involved in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance (3Van Parijs L. Abbas A.K. Science. 1998; 280: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). IL-4 is also a T-cell growth factor and is necessary for the development of Th2 cells (4Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar), which regulate humoral immune responses, whereas IL-7 is required for the development and growth of T lymphocytes but can also support the growth of peripheral T lymphocytes (5Chazen G.D.

IL-15 has overlapping functions with IL-2, but, unlike IL-2, IL-15 is essential for NK-cell differentiation and is more important than IL-2 in the generation of CD8+ memory T cells (8Waldmann T.A. Dubois S. Tagaya Y. Immunity. 2001; 14: 105-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although transgenic expression of IL-9 causes thymomas, suggesting that IL-9 can regulate lymphocyte growth (9Renauld J.C. van der Lugt N. Vink A. van Roon M. Godfraind C. Warnier G. Merz H.

Based onin vitro studies, IL-21 has potential roles for T-cell, B-cell, and NK-cell biology (11Parrish-Novak J. Dillon S.R. Nelson A. Hammond A. Sprecher C. Gross J.A. Johnston J. Madden K. Xu W.

Only limited information is available regarding the genes that are activated by γc-dependent cytokines. To investigate the basis for overlapping and distinctive actions of γc-dependent cytokines, we used the “Lymphochip” microarray, a specialized cDNA array enriched for genes expressed in lymphocytes (12Alizadeh A. Eisen M. Davis R.E. Ma C. Sabet H. Tran T. Powell J.I. Yang L. Marti G.E. Moore D.T. Hudson Jr., J.R. Chan W.C. Greiner T. Weisenburger D. Armitage J.O. Lossos I. Levy R. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Staudt L.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), to identify genes regulated by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 in peripheral blood T lymphocytes. IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 regulated most genes in a similar manner, whereas the pattern seen with IL-4 was more distinctive. Although most γc-dependent genes are redundantly regulated by various stimuli, certain cytokine-specific patterns of gene expression were noted. One gene induced by IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 but not IL-4 was dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5) (13Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Michieli P. Kelley C.A. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29897-29902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Kwak S.P. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1156-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). IL-2 is known to activate several signaling pathways, including Ras-MAP kinase, Jak-STAT, and phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt/p70 S6 kinase pathways (15Lin J.X. Leonard W.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and we now provide evidence for a role for DUSP5 as part of a negative feedback loop that controls IL-2-induced MAPK activity in T cells. This is the first demonstration of a role for DUSP5 in T-cell biology and identifies a mechanism by which IL-2-mediated MAPK activation can be controlled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation, stimulated for 18 h with phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 2 μg/ml), and expanded for 2 weeks in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (complete RPMI medium) supplemented with PHA (500 ng/ml) and IL-2 (50 units/ml). The cells were washed twice and resuspended in complete medium without PHA or IL-2 for 3 days. The purity of T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry, and only cultures with >95% CD3+ T cells were used for further studies. Cells were then not stimulated or stimulated with IL-2 (100 units/ml), IL-4 (100 units/ml), IL-7 (200 units/ml), or IL-15 (200 units/ml) for 4 h. We also separately performed more detailed time course experiments (0.5, 2, 4, 6, or 8 h) with IL-2 and IL-4. In some instances, PBMCs were stimulated for 1, 3, 6, or 24 h with phorbol 2-myristate 3-acetate (PMA) (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1.5 μm) (PI). B lymphocytes (>98% pure by flow cytometry) were isolated from PBMCs by negative magnetic selection using StemCell Technologies human B-cell enrichment mixture and cultured for 0, 1, 3, 6, or 24 h at 5 × 106 cells/ml in complete RPMI medium containing 50 μg/ml anti-IgM (Jackson Laboratories). Cell lines (Jurkat, Ramos, SUDHL10, L428, MCF-7, and PC-3) were cultured in complete RPMI medium. OCI-Ly8 cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 20% human plasma and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. CLL cells were obtained from untreated patients, and CD19+cells were purified by magnetic selection. For cDNA microarray analyses, mRNA was prepared using the Fast-Track kit (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Microarray analysis was performed as described in the “Microarray Procedures” section under “Methods” in Ref. 16Alizadeh A.A. Eisen M.B.

RNA samples from cytokine-stimulated T cell cultures were reverse transcribed, labeled with Cy5, and these probes were hybridized to microarrays together with Cy3-labeled probes generated from nonstimulated control cultures. Cy5-labeled probes were also generated from T cells stimulated with IL-2 or IL-4 for various time periods, PBMCs activated with PI, B-cells stimulated with anti-IgM beads, and cell lines and CLL cells. These were hybridized together with Cy3-labeled cDNA generated from a common reference mRNA pool (16Alizadeh A.A. Eisen M.B. Davis R.E. Ma C. Lossos I.S. Rosenwald A. Boldrick J.C. Sabet H. Tran T.

Microarrays were analyzed on a GenePix scanner (Axon Instruments), and data files were entered into a custom data base maintained at the National Institutes of Health (nciarray.nci.nih.gov). We used a standard global normalization approach for our expression data analogous to that previously used (16Alizadeh A.A. Eisen M.B. Davis R.E. Ma C. Lossos I.S. Rosenwald A. Boldrick J.C. Sabet H.

We extracted data for clustering analysis (programs “Cluster” and “TreeView”) (19Sporri B. Kovanen P.E. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Leonard W.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) that fulfilled the following requirements: spot size of at least 25 μm, minimum intensities of 100 relative fluorescent units (RFU) in the Cy3 and Cy5 channels or minimum intensity of at least 1000 RFU in one of the two channels. The 100 RFU criteria are as previously used for the Lymphochip and Axon 4000A scanner (17Rosenwald A. Alizadeh A.A. Widhopf G. Simon R. Davis R.E. Yu X. Yang L. Pickeral O.K. Rassenti L.Z. Powell J.

Unless stated otherwise, the expression of a gene was considered induced or repressed if the median induction or repression was at least 2-fold with any one cytokine in at least two of three experiments (five experiments were done with IL-2, three with IL-4, four with IL-7, and 3 three with IL-15). Total RNA (15 μg/lane) was northern blotted using PCR-amplified inserts of the following IMAGE clones: 176940, 203132, 1336478, 714453, 342378, 1304437 for Mal, TRAIL, MAPKAPK3, IL-4Rα, DUSP5, and TSC-22R, respectively, as well as probes for IL-2Rα (X01075), and pHe7 (which corresponds to a housekeeping gene). Real time PCR was performed using a Light Cycler. 10 ng of total RNA was amplified for 40 cycles with either DUSP5 (sense 5′-AAAGGGGGATA TGAGACTTTC-3′, antisense 5′-TTGGATGCATGGTAGGC ACTT-3′) or β-actin (Clontech)-specific primers. A standard curve was prepared by amplifying different amounts of total RNA prepared from IL-2-stimulated PBMCs. Results obtained with DUSP5-specific primers were normalized against β-actin. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For IL-2 receptor reconstitution experiments, cells were transfected in 10-cm plates with plasmids containing cDNAs for IL-2Rβ (2 μg), γc(0.5 μg), Jak3 (0.25 μg), and with control vector pRV (3 μg), wild type DUSP5 (3 μg), or inactive mutant of DUSP5 (C263S mutant) (3 μg) or the constitutively active MEK1 (3 μg) using EffecteneTM transfection reagent (Qiagen). For stable transfections, CTLL-2 cells were grown in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 50 units/ml of IL-2 and electroporated (5 × 106 cells, 170 V, 960 μF) with Myc-epitope tagged DUSP5 wild type or mutant cDNAs (36 μg) as well as with pBabe-puro (4 μg) to confer puromycin resistance. Transfected cells were plated on 6-well plates, and puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) was added the next day. The cDNAs for Myc-epitope tagged wild type and mutant (C263S) DUSP5, human Jak3, and constitutively active MEK1 were kindly provided by Jack E. Dixon, John O'Shea, and Silvio Gutkind, respectively. For Western blotting, cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. 15 μg of protein per lane was Western blotted. For immunoprecipitations, 150 μg of protein lysate was used. ERK-1/2 kinase activity was determined using Elk-1 as a substrate and the p44/42 MAP kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling). We used antibodies to phosphorylated ERK-1/2, phosphorylated-MEK1, ERK-1/2, phosphorylated Stat5 (all from Cell Signaling), MEK1 (Transduction Laboratories), Myc-epitope (9E10), IL-2Rβ phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-β-actin (AC-15, Sigma). DUSP5 anti-serum was a gift from Dr. Jack E. Dixon. Using cDNA microarrays, we identified 137 genes that were induced at least 2-fold by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, or IL-15 in preactivated T lymphocytes (genes induced or repressed at least 2-fold are in Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and will be made available at llmpp.nih.gov/cytokines). A one-sample t test was performed on the log ratios to evaluate the significance of the observed fold changes. We observed that 99% of IL-2-regulated (five experiments), 100% of IL-7-regulated (four experiments), 74% of IL-4-regulated (three experiments), and 54% of IL-15-regulated (three experiments) genes were differentially expressed to a degree that achieved statistical significance (two-sided p < 0.05). We hypothesize that the lower significance for the IL-4 and IL-15 groups results in large part from the lower power associated with having only three experiments for each of these cytokines. The induced genes (Figs. 1 and 2) included many genes previously known to be regulated by IL-2, such as those encoding the IL-2Rα chain, cyclin D2 (15Lin J.X. Leonard W.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), SOCS1 (19Sporri B. Kovanen P.E. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Leonard W.J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 17615-17620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the validity of our analysis. IL-4Rα was also induced by IL-4, as reported previously (22Ohara J. Paul W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8221-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We also identified 34 repressed genes (Fig. 3). Although the use of 2-fold induction criteria is common, smaller changes in gene expression levels can also be biologically significant, and certain known IL-2-induced genes were not identified by the 2-fold criteria. We therefore searched the microarray data for genes whose expression was induced or repressed by more than 40% (based on microarray analysis) in at least any 8 of the 15 experiments. 95 additional genes fulfilled these less stringent criteria (data not shown but will be made available at llmpp.nih.gov/cytokines). This group included c-myc (15Lin J.X. Leonard W.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and Bcl-XL(23Akbar A.N. Borthwick N.J. Wickremasinghe R.G.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), genes whose expression levels are known to be regulated by IL-2. Thus, it is important to evaluate genes whose mRNA levels are changed less than 2-fold as well.Figure 2Analysis of expression patterns of cytokine-induced genes in PI-stimulated PBMCs ( PBMC Act.), B cells after anti-IgM crosslinking (B-cell Act.), proliferating cell lines, and CLL cells.

D, genes induced >2-fold with BCR cross-linking of B cells but not induced by PI. E, genes specifically induced by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, or IL-15. Cytokine-inducible genes were assigned to this cluster based on lack of induction by PI stimulation of PBMCs or BCR cross-linking of B cells and variable expression cell lines and CLL samples. In panels A andB the blue circles correspond to genes whose expression was also studied by Northern blotting (Fig. 4). The time-course for PI stimulation and BCR cross-linking was 0, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h.

Gene expression data for highly induced genes after 4 h of stimulation with IL-2 (five experiments), IL-7 (four experiments), IL-15 (three experiments), and IL-4 (three experiments) and corresponding measurements in three time course experiments (two IL-2 experiments and one IL-4 experiment) at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. The genes were ranked by their average up-regulation in response to IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15. Data from the 20 most induced genes are shown. F, genes induced more than 2-fold by IL-4 that, in addition, were at least 2-fold more highly induced by IL-4 than by IL-2, IL-7, or IL-15. Inpanels B–D the “gene tree” on theleft indicates the degree of similarity in gene expression across all the experiments. The blue circlescorrespond to genes whose expression was also studied by Northern blotting in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The gene expression data were analyzed using average linkage hierarchical clustering (the Pearson correlation coefficient was used as the distance metric) (18Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13263) Google Scholar), yielding dendrograms that group experiments and genes based on the degree of similarity of their expression patterns (see Fig. 1). We separately analyzed genes that were induced by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, or IL-15 (Fig. 1 A), and the expression profiles seen with IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 were very similar (see for example Fig. 1, B–D). Some genes were induced in a similar fashion by all four cytokines (Fig. 1 B). A number of genes were strongly induced by IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 but not induced or only weakly induced by IL-4 (Fig. 1 C). A third set of genes was preferentially induced by IL-4 (Fig. 1 D). To determine whether the differences between the gene expression profiles for IL-2 and IL-4 represented differences in the kinetics of gene expression between the cytokines rather than induction of different genes, we studied gene expression 0.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after cytokine treatment (Fig. 1, E and F). In the four panels on the left, multiple experiments are shown at the 4-h time point for IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-4, whereas in the three panels on the right data are shown for two time courses for IL-2 and one for IL-4. Most genes showed increased expression in a cytokine-restricted manner between 0.5 and 2 h, and this increase was sustained for at least 8 h. For example, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and biliary glycoprotein were induced by IL-2 at 30 min but were not induced by IL-4 at any time point (second and third rows from the top in Fig. 1 E). Most of the genes we identified have not been previously linked to cytokine responses and many are functionally uncharacterized. One strategy for finding clues to the functions mediated by these genes is to define expression “signatures” characterizing cellular processes. One such expression signature is defined by a set of genes whose expression correlates with cell proliferation in that they are highly expressed in proliferating cell lines (Fig. 2 A, third panel from the left, lanes A–G) but are expressed at a low level in CLL cells (lanes H–L) which are relatively quiescent in their growth properties (16Alizadeh A.A. Eisen M.B. Davis R.E. Ma C. Lossos I.S. Rosenwald A. Boldrick J.C. Sabet H. Tran T. Yu X. Powell J.I. Yang L. Marti G.E. Moore T. Hudson Jr., J. Lu L. Lewis D.B. Tibshirani R. Sherlock G. Chan W.C.

Staudt L.M. et al.Nature. 2000; 403: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (8076) Google Scholar). ∼20% of the genes induced by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and/or IL-15 fulfilled these criteria. We sought to identify a set of genes that could distinguish a γc-dependent cytokine response from other activation events, and we compared genes induced or repressed by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 with those regulated in PBMCs (>70% T cells) by PI and in B cells after antigen receptor cross-linking (Fig. 2). We found that 73% of the genes induced by the cytokines were also induced in PI-stimulated PBMCs (Fig. 2,A–C, first column of panels from the left). The induction typically occurred within 1 h, minimizing the possibility that PI-dependent cytokine production was responsible for the PI effect. BCR stimulation of B cells induced less overlapping (41%) gene expression profiles (Fig. 2,A and B versus C andD, compare first and second panels from the left), consistent with the use of nonshared signaling pathways or lineage-specific differences in expression. 23% of the γc-dependent genes showed a more restricted expression pattern, as they were not up-regulated by either PI treatment of PBMCs or BCR cross-linking of B cells. We also identified 34 genes that were consistently repressed by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and/or IL-15 (Fig. 3), most of which were also repressed in PBMCs treated with PI or B cells treated with anti-IgM. Analogous to many of the activated genes being poorly expressed in CLL cells, many of the repressed genes were more highly expressed in CLL cells than in highly proliferating cell lines (Fig. 3, third panel from the left,lanes H–L versus A–G), suggesting a correlation between the expression of these genes and establishing or maintaining a more quiescent state. We confirmed the induction or repression of select genes (those encoding IL-2Rα, TRAIL, MAPKAPK3, DUSP5, Mal, IL-4Rα and TSC-22R;blue circles in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). IL-2Rα, TRAIL, and DUSP5 were more potently induced by IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 than by IL-4. Mal and IL-4Rα were most strongly induced by IL-4. MAPKAPK3 was induced by all four cytokines, and TSC-22R was repressed by all of the cytokines. One of the genes induced by IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 but not by IL-4 was that encoding DUSP5, a dual-specificity phosphatase originally cloned from mammary epithelial (13Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P.

Bottaro D.P. Michieli P. Kelley C.A. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29897-29902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DUSP5 can hydrolyze proteins at both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues, and recombinant DUSP5 can decrease the catalytic activity of purified ERK-1 protein in vitro(13Ishibashi T.

Because IL-2 can activate ERK-1/2 as well as induce DUSP5 expression, we hypothesized that DUSP5 induction might be part of a negative feedback loop controlling IL-2-induced MAPK activity. We first confirmed that IL-2 could induce ERK-1/2 phosphorylation in the T cells (Fi"

The purified enzyme showed N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase activity, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of polyamines in plants and bacteria. N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase activity was confirmed by identification of two of the three occurring products, namely putrescine and ammonia. In contrast, no enzymatic activity could be detected when applying various compounds including nitriles, amines, and amides as well as other N-carbamoyl compounds, indicating the specificity of the enzyme forN-carbamoylputrescine.

Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1344-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) describing a protein superfamily whose members are all involved in the cleavage of C-N bonds but display only moderate homology (12–24% amino acid identity). Members of this family are found from bacteria to man and can be classified into 13 branches (2Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 12: 775-782Google Scholar,3Brenner C. Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 2002; 12: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The family includes the following: (i) nitrilases (and cyanide hydratases) and aliphatic amidases, which hydrolyze nitriles (−CN) or amides (−CONH2), respectively, to the corresponding carboxylic acids; (ii) β-alanine synthases (also calledβ-ureidopropionases), which produce β-alanine from N-carbamoyl-β-alanine (β-ureidopropionic acid); and (iii) other amidohydrolases whose natural substrates are largely unknown. The genome ofArabidopsis thaliana encodes eight C-N hydrolases: (i) four nitrilases, one of which (NIT4) was identified asβ-cyanoalanine hydratase/nitrilase (4Piotrowski M. Schönfelder S. Weiler E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2616-2621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); (ii) oneβ-alanine synthase involved in pyrimidine catabolism (5Walsh T.A. Green S.B. Larrinua I.M. Schmiter P.R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); and (iii) three other nitrilase-like proteins (NLPs)1 whose function is yet unknown. One of these, provisionally called NLP1, shows high homology to a recently characterized protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the function of which was defined asN-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase, involved in polyamine biosynthesis in this species (6Nakada Y. Jiang Y. Nishijyo T. Itoh Y. Lu C.-D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6517-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Polyamines are low molecular mass polycations of vital function for all living organisms. A key intermediate in polyamine biosynthesis is putrescine (H2N(CH2)4NH2), which is already a polyamine and is further converted to higher polyamines like spermidine and spermine. In principle, two different biosynthetic pathways lead to the formation of putrescine: (i) the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) pathway through the decarboxylation of ornithine by ODC; and (ii) the arginine decarboxylase (ADC) pathway through the successive reactions of arginine decarboxylase (producing agmatine from arginine), agmatine iminohydrolase (producingN-carbamoylputrescine from agmatine), and finallyN-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (producing putrescine from N-carbamoylputrescine). Both pathways are described as occurring in plants (reviewed in Ref. 7Kumar A. Altabella T. Tayler M.A. Tiburcio A.F. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (332) Google Scholar), but recently it was shown that in A. thaliana no ODC gene exists and that the ornithine decarboxylating activity found in extracts of this plant was non-enzymatic (8Hanfrey C. Sommer S. Mayer M.J. Burtin D. Michael A.J. Plant J. 2001; 27: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This stresses the importance of the ADC-pathway for plants, at least with respect to A. thaliana. Many genes of plant polyamine biosynthesis have been cloned (for review see Ref. 9Bagni N. Tassoni A. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2001; 20: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), but until now the genes of the ADC-pathway encoding agmatine iminohydrolase and N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase were not known. We will show here that the C-N hydrolase NLP1 of A. thaliana encodes a functional N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase. Synthesis ofN-carbamoylputrescine·HCl was done according to Smith and Garraway (10Smith T.A. Garraway J.L. Phytochemistry. 1964; 3: 23-26Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Purification of N-carbamoylputrescine was performed as follows. After removal of the side productN,N-dicarbamoylputrescine by filtration, the filtrate was evaporated to dryness. The residue was extracted with ethanol, and the extract again was evaporated to dryness. The residue was then dissolved in 50 ml of water, neutralized using 2 mHCl, and loaded on a column (25 cm × 1.5 cm) of Dowex 50 X 8 (Li-form). Elution was done with 3-aminopropyl-1,3-diaminopropane (0.2m, neutralized with 2 m HCl). The eluting fractions were tested by thin layer chromatography for ninhydrin-positive substances. Fractions showing only one ninhydrin-positive spot were combined, evaporated to dryness, and recrystallized from 96% (v/v) ethanol. The final product (165 mg) showed a melting point of 186–187 °C (reported melting point ofN-carbamoylputrescine, 185–186 °C). NLP1 was received as an EST clone (70G11T7, GenBankTM accession number AA586100) from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) and cloned into the pET-21b(+)-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) using the same strategy as described for the four nitrilases ofA. thaliana (11Vorwerk S. Biernacki S. Hillebrand H. Janzik I. Müller A. Weiler E.W. Piotrowski M. Planta. 2001; 212: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In brief, the NLP1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using the EST plasmid DNA as a template, simultaneously introducing an NdeI restriction site (including the start codon CATATG) at the 5′-end and aSalI restriction site instead of the stop codon at the 3′-end. The PCR product was then cloned into the NdeI andXhoI sites of the pET-21b(+)-vector. Expression was done inEscherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After purification of the His6-tagged NLP1 using Ni2+-chelate chromatography (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), the purified protein was desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Protein concentrations were between 8 and 12 μg/μl. The purified protein was shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The standard reaction contained 1 μg of protein in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, in a final volume of 1 ml. Substrates were added at a final concentration of 1–3 mm. Reactions were carried out for 1–2 h at 37 °C or, for determination of the kinetic parameters of NLP1, for 30 min at 30 °C. Ammonia production was measured using the Berthelot reaction as described elsewhere (4Piotrowski M. Schönfelder S. Weiler E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2616-2621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Production of putrescine was shown qualitatively and semiquantitatively by thin layer chromatography. Aliquots (5 μl) of the sample were spotted on silica plates (Polygram SIL G/UV254, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), which were subsequently developed in ethanol/NH4OH (25% (v/v)) 1:1.N-Carbamoylputrescine and putrescine were visualized with ninhydrin. A standard reaction as described above usingN-carbamoylputrescine as the substrate was performed with the modification that the buffer concentration was reduced to 5 mm. After 2 h, a 100-μl aliquot was withdrawn, and 400 μl of ethanol were added. After boiling for 10 min, the denatured protein was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 13,000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge), and the supernatant evaporated to dryness. The residue was resuspended in 500 μl of 0.5 mmpentadecafluorooctanoic acid, and insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation (15 min, 13,000 rpm). The soluble supernatant was diluted 10-fold in 0.5 mm pentadecafluorooctanoic acid and infused at 5 μl/min into a Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) with the following settings: capillary, 3000 V; cone voltage, 25 V; collision energy, 5 eV; collision gas off. Blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Schägger et al. (12Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) for soluble proteins using a 4–15% (w/v) separating gel. Fifty-five amino acid sequences of C-N hydrolases, therein 31 nitrilases (including two cyanide-hydratases), three aliphatic amidases, fourβ-alanine synthases (β-ureidopropionases), one N-carbamoyl-d-amino acid amidohydrolase, one putative N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase, and 15 C-N hydrolases of yet unknown substrate-specificities were aligned using the DNAMAN software (version 5.2.2, Lynnon Biosoft, Vaudreuil, Quebec, Canada), and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the same software with a maximum likelihood algorithm and 100 bootstrap trials. Leaves (∼1 g) were incubated on a potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.8) or on a buffer that included sorbitol (0.4 m) for 12 h under constant illumination. Extraction of RNA, formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, blotting on Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (AmershamBiosciences), and hybridization to radiolabeled probes was done following standard protocols (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments of the arginine decarboxylase genes 1 and 2 were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the sequences published in GenBankTM (accession numbers U52851 and AF009647, respectively) as described (14Soyka S. Heyer A.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were synthesized using the High Prime DNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics) and [α-32P]dATP (110 TBq mmol−1, Amersham Biosciences). In the course of our studies on plant nitrilases (4Piotrowski M. Schönfelder S. Weiler E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2616-2621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Vorwerk S. Biernacki S. Hillebrand H. Janzik I. Müller A. Weiler E.W. Piotrowski M. Planta. 2001; 212: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) we detected genes from A. thaliana coding for proteins homologous to nitrilases, which we subsequently called provisionally nitrilase-like proteins. 2M. Piotrowski, unpublished results. Of the three NLPs existing in A. thaliana (NLP1, gene At2g27450; NLP2, gene At4g08790; and NLP3, gene At5g12040), NLP1 is annotated as a putative nitrilase and shows high homology to an EST clone from tomato, which is annotated as β-alanine synthase (88% identity, GenBankTM accession number Y19104). However, NLP1 showed noβ-alanine synthase activity2 (vide infra), and recently the real β-alanine-synthase fromA. thaliana was cloned (5Walsh T.A. Green S.B. Larrinua I.M. Schmiter P.R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of a large number of C-N hydrolases revealed that NLP1, together with the above mentioned C-N hydrolase from tomato, lies on one branch withβ-alanine synthases and anN-carbamoyl-d-amino acid amidohydrolase fromAgrobacterium sp. (AspDCase in Fig. 1). These enzymes have in common the fact that they hydrolyze N-carbamoyl compounds, and it could therefore be speculated that the natural substrate for NLP1 and its tomato homolog is also an N-carbamoyl compound. Recently, the gene of a N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase fromP. aeruginosa was identified (6Nakada Y. Jiang Y. Nishijyo T. Itoh Y. Lu C.-D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6517-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (PaCPA in Fig. 1), and the coded amino acid sequence shows high similarity to NLP1 (67% identity). This is not only in line with the above mentioned hypothesis but moreover points to N-carbamoylputrescine as a possible substrate of NLP1. PaCPA belongs to the same family (family 11) of C-N hydrolases (as classified by Pace and Brenner, Refs.2Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 12: 775-782Google Scholar and 3Brenner C. Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 2002; 12: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) as NLP1. The function of the members of this family was formerly unknown, but it now seems to emerge that they are involved in polyamine biosynthesis (Ref. 6Nakada Y. Jiang Y. Nishijyo T. Itoh Y. Lu C.-D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6517-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, and vide infra). The cDNA of NLP1 was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center as an EST clone and was subsequently sequenced. It contains a proposed complete open reading frame of 900-bp coding for 299 amino acids and 31 bp of the 5′-UTR. The open reading frame, which is 100% identical to the published sequence derived from the genome data (GenBankTM accession number NM_128305) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET-21b(+)-vector. NLP1 was expressed as His6-tagged protein in E. coli and purified using Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography to apparent homogeneity as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The purified enzyme displayed N-carbamoylputrescine activity as shown by different methods as follows. (i) By thin layer chromatography it could be shown that N-carbamoylputrescine vanished during the time course of the reaction while a product, showing the same Rf value as authentic putrescine, was formed (Fig. 2 A). (ii) This product could be identified as putrescine by mass spectrometric analysis, because it showed the same ESI-TOF spectrum as authentic putrescine (Fig. 3). (iii) In addition to putrescine, NH4+ was formed as shown by the indophenol blue method (Fig. 2 B).Figure 3Mass spectrometric identification of the reaction product as putrescine.

Activity was measured as ammonia-producing activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” N.D., not detectable. This is the first time that cloning of an in vitro activeN-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase is reported. This enzyme is of vital importance for A. thaliana, because putrescine biosynthesis via the ODC pathway (vide supra) does not occur in A. thaliana because of the absence of ornithine decarboxylase (8Hanfrey C. Sommer S. Mayer M.J. Burtin D. Michael A.J. Plant J. 2001; 27: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Using BLAST search (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) sequences for homologues of NLP1 can be found for many plant species, indicating that the ADC pathway of putrescine biosynthesis may be widespread among higher plants (data not shown). To completely uncover the putrescine biosynthesis pathway of A. thaliana, cloning a functional agmatine iminohydrolase (agmatine deiminase) is necessary. NLP1 showed maximal activity at ∼40 °C and between pH 8 and 9. Determination of kinetic parameters revealed that NLP1 showed no Michaelis-Menten kinetics toward N-carbamoylputrescine (Fig. 4, dotted line). The v/s graph was found to be sigmoid and could be described by the Hill equation v = (V max·[S]h)/(K + [S]h). Non-linear regression of the data to this equation (Fig. 4, solid line) gave a Hill coefficient (h) of 2.2, indicating positive cooperative binding of the substrate, and a V max value of 86 nanokatals (mg of protein)−1. Half maximal velocity was reached at 135 μm substrate. Cooperative binding of the substrate with comparable h values was also found for β-alanine synthases of man and rat (16Sakamoto T. Sakata S.F. Matsuda K. Horikawa Y. Tamaki N. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 2001; 47: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Tamaki N. Mizutani N. Kikugawa M. Fujimoto S. Mizota C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), enzymes showing high similarity to NLP1 (see Fig. 1). A reason for cooperative substrate binding may be allosterism of the enzyme. Most C-N hydrolases studied so far are forming homomultimers ranging from tetramers to hexadecamers. We tested the multimeric structure of NLP1 using blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). NLP1 showed a native molecular mass of 279 kDa, indicating that it consists of eight monomers. A fainter band corresponding to a molecular mass of 432 kDa, indicative of a dodecamer, could not be detected in all preparations and may be a contaminating protein of E. coli. Further studies regarding allosteric behavior of NLP1 are currently underway.Figure 5Native molecular mass of NLP1.

Emory K.K. Piatak R.M. Malmberg R.L. Plant J. 1998; 13: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in different organs by Northern-blot analysis (Fig. 6 A). Flowering plants were divided into roots, stems, rosette leaves, and complete flowers. In all organs investigated, the mRNA of ADC1, ADC2, and NLP1 was detectable. The highest expression for all three genes was found in the roots and the flowers, whereas expression in stems and leaves was lower. These results are in contrast to those shown by Soyka and Heyer (14Soyka S. Heyer A.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), who found only weak expression ofADC1 and ADC2 in roots and a strong expression ofADC1 in rosette leaves. However, the stronger expression of ADC pathway genes in roots compared with rosette leaves and stems shown here is in agreement with the ∼2-fold higher putrescine levels of roots compared with shoots reported by Watson et al. (18Watson M.B. Emory K.K. Piatak R.M. Malmberg R.L. Plant J. 1998; 13: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is also worth mentioning that most of the A. thaliana EST clones coding for NLP1 were made from root mRNA. We next investigated the expression of NLP1 in leaves under osmotic stress, which leads to a strong increase of putrescine levels inA. thaliana, concomitant with an increase of ADC activity caused by a strong induction of the ADC2 gene (14Soyka S. Heyer A.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Feirer R.P. Hocking K.L. Woods P.J. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 153: 733-738Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As expected, we could show a strong induction of theADC2 gene upon osmotic stress treatment (Fig. 6 B), whereas the expression of ADC1 was very low in buffer-treated leaves and reached comparable levels in stressed leaves and freshly harvested leaves. The expression of NLP1kept constant under the conditions tested, indicating thatN-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase is not the rate-limiting enzyme in osmotic stress-induced putrescine biosynthesis. The expression of NLP1 was found to be very low; we did not detect the protein in crude extracts of leaves by use of anα-NLP1 antibody, nor could we showN-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase activity using the NH3 assay (data not shown). “NLP1” was only a provisional name based on the homology of this enzyme to nitrilases. Because enzyme names defined by function are preferable, we propose to call this enzyme CPA (forN-carbamoylputrescineamidohydrolase). We could also show that the tomato NLP, which was annotated as β-alanine-synthase, is a functional CPA (data not shown).

Murre C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mice missing any one of these transcription factors show complete block in B cell development at the pro-B cell stage (2Zhuang Y. Sorian P. Weintraub H.

Although the expression of EBF and Pax5 are relatively restricted to the B cell lineage, E2A is found to be much broadly expressed. Both biochemical and genetic analyses have indicated that E2A is the most upstream regulator among the three transcription factors and is continuously involved in regulating the expression of B cell-specific genes through the later stages of B cell development (6Quong M.W. Harris D.P. Swain S.L. Murre C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6307-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,7Herblot S. Aplan P.D. Hoang T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 886-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is not clear how E2A controls the broad array of tissue-specific and stage-specific gene expression during B cell development. E2A is a founding member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 transcription factor family, which plays an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating the differentiation events in various tissue types including B lymphocytes in mammals (8Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 827-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The E2A gene encodes two bHLH transcription factors, E12 and E47, which are generated through differential splicing to two adjacent exons that encode the bHLH domains (9Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). The bHLH domains are required for protein dimerization and DNA binding (10Voronova A. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4722-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Two transactivation domains (AD) are mapped to the amino terminus of the E2A proteins (11Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Aronheim A. Shiran R. Rosen A. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8063-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). E2A proteins form homodimers or heterodimers through HLH interactions with other broadly expressed bHLH transcription factors such as HEB (13Barndt R.J. Dai M. Zhuang Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6677-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or with tissue-restricted bHLH transcription factors such as MyoD (14Lassar A.B. Murre C. Davis R.L. Voronova A. Wright W.E. Baltimore D. Kadesch T. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). These bHLH protein dimers bind to DNA at the consensus sequence CANNTG, designated as the E-box. Functional E-box sites are found in the promoters and enhancers of a wide variety of tissue-specific genes including immunoglobulin genes in B cells (15Bain G. Gruenwald S. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3522-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The ubiquitously expressed histone acetyltransferases (HATs) p300, CBP, and PCAF are transcription co-activators that interact with a broad spectrum of tissue-specific and nonspecific transcription factors (16Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection experiments have demonstrated that p300 can associate with the bHLH region (17Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and the amino-terminal region (18Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) of E2A proteins. Studies in yeast further postulate that E2A mediates transcriptional activation through a recruitment of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gen5-acetyltransferase)-like chromatin remodeling complex, which contains a HAT (19Massari M. Grant P. Pray-Grant M. Berger S. Workman J. Murre C. Molecular Cell. 1999; 4: 63-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, no study thus far has addressed directly the functional significance of HAT-E2A interaction in B cell development. Here, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence to show that the HATs p300, CBP, and PCAF are regulators of E2A activity in B lymphocytes and the regulation is important for proper B cell development. The B cell lines REH and NALM6 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 5 mmHEPES. The cell line 293T was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate transfection method. For transfections, a Myc-tagged E2–5 was generated by adding six repeats of Myc tag to the amino terminus of E2–5. E2–5 is a version of human E2A cDNA that contains the E47 bHLH domain (20Wilson R.B. Kiledjian M. Shen C.P. Benezra R. Zwollo P. Dymecki S.M. Desiderio S.V. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6185-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Individual plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged PCAF, Myc-tagged p300, Myc-tagged p300DY, and FLAG-tagged CBP were generated as described (21Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao TP. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). High and low molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences) were resuspended in AG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) and run through the Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) using an FPLC apparatus (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min to generate a standard curve. For each cell line, nuclear extract amounts of 2.5–5 mg were loaded onto the column in a total volume of 250 μl and run at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 500-μl intervals and assigned numbers from 1 to 40. Upon fraction collection, proteins present in each fraction were precipitated by adding 4–8 volumes of HPLC grade acetone to each fraction. Recovered protein samples were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with protein G-Sepharose under conditions described previously (22Bannister A. Koezarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were monoclonal anti-E2A (13641A, Pharmingen), polyclonal anti-p300 (sc-585, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-CBP (sc-583, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-PCAF (sc-6300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and monoclonal anti-acetylated lysine (AKL5C1 (23Komatsu, Y., Yukutake, Y., and Yoshida, M. (2002) J. Immunol. Methods, in pressGoogle Scholar)). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by liquid transfer to nitrocellulose and immunostaining of the blot according to standard procedure (24Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S., La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 373: 691-694Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies for Western blot analysis as described previously were used at a 1:4000 dilution. Each HAT expression plasmid (5 μg) was transfected into 293T cells via the calcium phosphate method. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and HAT proteins were purified from transfected 293T cells using either FLAG (FLAG-CBP, FLAG-PCAF) or Myc (Myc-p300, Myc-p300DY)-conjugated agarose. HAT recovery was verified by colloidal staining and Western blotting of purified protein. Equivalent amounts (1 μg) of each HAT protein were used for each experiment. GST-tagged E2–5 and the deletion mutants were cloned into the PGEX-1 vector and were expressed inEscherichia coli per the instructions of the supplier (Amersham Biosciences). The N′ truncation was generated by deleting sequence upstream from the internal NotI site at the position corresponding to amino acid 401 of E2–5. TheC′ truncation was generated by deleting sequence downstream of the bHLH domain at position corresponding to amino acid 513 of E2–5. Acetyltransferase assays were carried out as described (22Bannister A. Koezarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of GST-E2–5 was added to 1 μg of HAT protein purified from transfected 293T cells in 1× HAT buffer with the addition of [1-14C]acetyl coenzyme A (AmershamBiosciences, catalog no. CFA729, 10 μCi (370 kBq)). Equivalent loading of GST proteins was established by running samples on a SDS-PAGE and visualizing the protein bands by colloidal staining (Invitrogen). DNA (2–5 μg) coding for Myc-E2A and each individual HAT was transfected into 293T cells via the calcium phosphate method. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and Myc-E2A protein was purified from transfected 293T cell extract by Myc-conjugated agarose using the standard immunoprecipitation protocol with the addition of Trichostatin H (5 μm). Immunoprecipitated samples were washed and run on an SDS-PAGE for separation. After protein transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the presence of acetylation was detect with the aid of an anti-acetylated lysine antibody. All blots were stripped and reprobed for the presence of E2A. The expression of HAT protein was verified by Western blot. Both the dual luciferase and chloramphenicol reporter assays were conducted according to manufacturer's specifications (Promega). For each assay, 1–3 μg of E2A was co-transfected with 2 μg of HAT and 1 μg of each reporter into 3T3 fibroblast cells. Both reporter constructs contained four repeats of E-box sequence from the muscle creatine kinase gene and the minimal TK promoter, also known as 4R-TK (17Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). A Renillaconstitutive expression vector and a constitutive β-galactosidase expression vector were used as transfection controls for the luciferase and chloramphenicol reporter assays, respectively. Human 293T cells were transferred to glass coverslips and transfected as described previously (25Soutoglou E. Katrakilli N. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Once fixed and blocked, the cells were immunostained with anti-E2A antibodies followed by a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Anti-fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes) was used to mount a coverslip, and slides were examined for FITC fluorescence under a fluorescent microscope. Mice heterozygous for E2A (2Zhuang Y. Sorian P. Weintraub H. Cell. 1994; 79: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) or p300 (26Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) were maintained on a 129/sv and BL/6 mixed background. Compound heterozygous mice were obtained through intercrosses of these single heterozygous mice. Phenotypic analysis was conducted on 126 neonates and 26 adult mice. Bone marrow and thymus samples were prepared by suspending the macerated tissue in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% fetal bovine serum. For each sample, 20,000 cells were scored on a BD Pharmingen FACScan analyzer and analyzed by CellQuest (BD Pharmingen). The following antibodies were used in the experiment: B220-APC, CD19-PE, IgM-FITC, CD8-APC, CD4-PE, CD5-FITC, and CD43-PE (Caltag). Cell viability was determined by the exclusion of 7AAD staining (Molecular Probes). We first used a biochemical approach to evaluate E2A-containing protein complexes in HeLa cells transfected with a Myc-tagged E2–5, a fully functional human E2A cDNA (20Wilson R.B. Kiledjian M. Shen C.P. Benezra R. Zwollo P. Dymecki S.M. Desiderio S.V. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6185-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Size exclusion gel filtration of nuclear extract from E2A-transfected HeLa cells eluted E2A-containing complexes in fractions corresponding to molecular sizes greater than the molecular mass of an E2A dimer, ∼160 kDa. Monomeric E2A protein in whole cell extract was detected by the anti-Myc antibody 9E10 to have a molecular mass of ∼80 kDa (Fig. 1 A). Western blot analysis indicated that E2A proteins were detected in eluted fractions corresponding to molecular masses as large as 1 MDa and remained present in fractions that eluted down to the monomeric protein molecular weight. These results indicate that E2A is present in complexes consisting of more than just a dimer. This result prompted us to evaluate further the endogenous E2A proteins present in pre-B cells. Fractions eluted from size exclusion analysis of the human pre-B cell line NALM6 nuclear extract were analyzed by Western blotting for E2A and the histone acetyltransferases p300, CBP, and PCAF. The results indicated that a significant percentage of endogenous E2A is found in a high molecular weight range. The HATs p300, CBP, and PCAF were found co-eluted with E2A in a broad spectrum of molecular mass ranging up to 1 MDa in size (Fig. 1 B). On denaturing gels, monomeric E2A, p300, CBP, and a subunit of PCAF were detected with molecular masses of ∼70, 300, 300, and 95 kDa, respectively. The detection of E2A and HATs in the same eluted fractions is consistent with previous transfection studies in which E2A was shown to interact with p300 (17Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fractionation data suggest that E2A has the potential to interact specifically with each of the three HATs, p300, CBP, and PCAF, in B cells. To investigate this possibility, E2A was immunoprecipitated from the nuclear extract of two pre-B cell lines, NALM6 and REH, using a monoclonal antibody against E2A. After SDS-PAGE analysis of the pull-down products, polyclonal antibodies detected p300, CBP, or PCAF in NALM6 nuclear extract pull-downs (Fig. 2, lane 3) and CBP or PCAF in REH nuclear extract pull-downs (Fig. 2,lane 4). A direct comparison of the band intensities derived from the pull-down products (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and4) and crude nuclear extracts (Fig. 2, lanes 1and 2) indicated that approximately one-fiftieth (1/50) of the HAT protein present in the NALM6 nuclear extract was associated with E2A. To confirm the presence of E2A in the pull-down samples, all blots were stripped and reprobed with an anti-E2A antibody to verify the presence of E2A (data not shown). As a negative control, an antibody against the GST protein was not able to pull down each HAT from the two cell lines (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). These results indicate that fractions of E2A are associated with p300, CBP, or, PCAF in pre-B cells. Because HATs are known to acetylate lysine residues present in histone and non-histone proteins (16Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar), in vitro acetylation assays were employed to determine whether an enzymatic interaction occurs between E2A and each HAT. Three GST-E2A fusion proteins, the full-length E2–5, a carboxyl-terminal truncation, and an amino-terminal truncation, were used in the acetylation assay (Fig. 3 A). GST and GST-p53 were used as a negative and a positive control, respectively. The size and equivalence of loading for each GST fusion protein were demonstrated by colloidal blue staining (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–3). Western analysis further confirmed that an anti-E2A antibody could recognize all three versions of GST-E2A proteins (Fig. 3 B,lanes 5–7). The acetylation assay shows that p300, CBP, and PCAF can acetylate bacterially expressed E2–5 (Fig. 3 C,lanes 2, 8, and 14) and the carboxyl-terminal deleted E2–5 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4, 10, and 16) but not the amino-terminal deleted E2–5 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3, 9, and 15). The ability of each HAT to autoacetylate itself demonstrates that the HAT proteins are fully functional and are equally loaded based on band intensities (Fig. 3 C, upper panel). Acetylation was also found in several protein degradation products from the E2–5 full-length and carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs (Fig. 3 C, bands marked with *). It is consistent with the notion that the amino terminus of the E2–5 is acetylated because these protein fragments were recovered from the GST pull-down and thus contain the amino part of the E2–5 proteins. In the same tests, we show that GST-p53 was acetylated (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5 and 11) and that GST alone (Fig. 3 C,lanes 1, 7, and 13) or E2A without the presence of HAT (Fig. 3 C, lanes 6 and12) was not acetylated. Altogether, this assay demonstrates that the amino half of E2A is a direct target for the acetylation by HATs in vitro. To further investigate HAT-mediated E2A acetylation, we preformed an in vivo analysis to determine whether each HAT could acetylate E2A. Antibodies against acetylated lysine were used to determine the acetylation status of E2A in a transfection assay. Myc-tagged E2A proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies before being used in the Western analysis (Fig. 4). We show that E2A co-transfection with wild-type p300 and CBP in human 293T cells significantly increased E2A acetylation in comparison with E2A alone (Fig. 4 A). In addition, the acetylation of E2A by p300 was dependent upon the acetyltransferase activity of p300, as an acetylase-deficient mutation (DY) derived from a human tumor mutation (21Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao TP. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) failed to induce E2A acetylation (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). Under this assay condition, we did not detect a significant level of acetylation by PCAF even though PCAF was expressed in the transfected cells (Fig. 4 B). This experiment did not rule out the possibility that each HAT may interact with E2A in a cell type-specific manner. A role for p300 in stimulating the transcription activity of E2A has been shown previously (17Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We wanted to evaluate further whether CBP and PCAF could similarly enhance E2A-mediated transcription. Reporter constructs containing four repeats of the E2A binding site (17Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) were used in two separate transient transfection assays. Consistent with the earlier findings, figure 5 shows that co-transfection of E2A with p300 (lanes 6 and 14) in 3T3 fibroblast cells increases reporter gene expression over E2A alone (lanes 5and 13). Similar to p300, CBP (lanes 7 and15) and PCAF (lanes 8 and 16) can also enhance E2A-mediated transactivation of the reporter genes. These results indicated that p300, CBP, and PCAF may play similar roles in modulating E2A activity. Studies indicate that acetylation can affect nuclear retention of transcription factors (25Soutoglou E. Katrakilli N. Talianidis I. Mol.

Low levels of endogenous E2A expression in 293T cells produced an undetectable background of E2A staining (Fig. 6, A1). In contrast, nuclear and cytoplasmic dispersal of E2A are clearly visible after transfection with E2–5 expression vector (Fig. 6, A2). Co-expression of p300 (Fig. 6, A3) or CBP (Fig. 6, A5) significantly increased the amount of E2A retained in the nucleus. Co-transfection of PCAF mildly increased nuclear retention of the transiently expressed E2A protein (Fig. 6, A6). Enhanced nuclear retention of E2A was not observed in 293T cells co-transfected with the enzymatic inactive mutant p300DY (Fig. 6, A4). The greatest increase in nuclear retention was observed in cells co-transfected with either E2A and CBP or E2A and p300, which accounted for ∼65 and 55%, respectively, of E2A-positive cells (Fig. 6 B). Cells co-transfected with E2A and PCAF demonstrated enhanced nuclear retention in ∼35% of the E2A-positive cells. In contrast, only 1–2% of the cells showed nuclear retention in transfections with E2A alone or E2A and p300DY, respectively. Expression of individual HAT proteins in transfected cells was verified independently by Western blot assay (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that acetylation of E2A or acetylation of a protein that associates with E2A increases nuclear retention. It has been shown that mice heterozygous for E2A produce fewer B cells than wild-type controls (2Zhuang Y. Sorian P. Weintraub H. Cell. 1994; 79: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). This phenotype can be enhanced further by mutations in functionally related genes when tested in the compound heterozygous mice (26Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27O'Riordan M. Grosschedl R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A study of p300 heterozygous mice has also revealed a gene dosage effect of p300 on embryonic development (28Yao T.P., Oh, S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T., Li, E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). To determine whether a functional interaction between E2A and the histone acetyltransferase p300 is required for normal B cell development, we analyzed bone marrow B cells from littermates of a cross between mice that were heterozygous for either E2A or p300. Phenotypic analysis of bone marrow cells of 6–10-day-old littermates demonstrated that E2A and p300 double heterozygous mice had a greater reduction of total B lineage cells (CD19+B220+) and mature B cells (IgM+B220+) than either of the single heterozygous littermates (Fig. 7,A and B, left panel (Neonates)). This additive effect on bone marrow B cell development seems restricted to neonates. Analysis of 3–16-month-old adult mice shows a consistent reduction of B cell numbers in E2A heterozygous mice, but the phenotype is not exacerbated in the double heterozygous mice (Fig. 7 B, right panel (Adults)). Both neonates and adults show no defect in T cell development (Fig. 7 A and data not shown), indicating that the genetic interaction between E2A and p300 is somewhat restricted to the B cell lineage. Previous studies have indicated that the HAT p300 may interact with E2A at multiple, independent sites including AD1 (18Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Massari M. Grant P. Pray-Grant M. Berger S. Workman J. Murre C. Molecular Cell. 1999; 4: 63-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), AD2 (18Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the bHLH domain (17Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It is generally hypothesized that these interactions allow the enhancer-bound E2A to recruit p300, which subsequently facilitates transcription through acetylation of either histones or the general transcription apparatus (17Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell.

Molecular Cell. 1999; 4: 63-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the significance of this interaction in regulating E2A function is still undetermined for normal tissues under physiological conditions. In a series of biochemical studies we have shown that the endogenous E2A proteins interact with p300, CBP, and PCAF acetyltransferases in pre-B cells. We have shown further that E2A is also a target of the enzymatic activity of these HATs. Although the effect of acetylation on E2A function remains to be determined fully, our data suggest that this modification can increase E2A-mediated transcription, which may in part be the result of increased nuclear retention of E2A. Finally, we have provided genetic evidence to show that E2A and p300 interaction is important for normal B lymphocyte development in the bone marrow. The work presented here is the first to show that E2A is acetylated by three functionally related HATs: p300, CBP, and PCAF. This acetylation of E2A is apparently independent of AD1 because the E2–5 cDNA used in this study lacks the AD1 domain. Using deletion mutants of GST-E2–5, we have determined that the amino half of E2–5 is acetylated by p300, CBP, or PCAF. The amino terminus of E2–5 contains multiple, isolated lysine residues and a cluster of lysine residues at position 80–84 (KKVRK). This lysine cluster along with the nearby sequences is highly conserved between Caenorhabditis elegansand man. However, mutagenesis conversion of these lysine residues to arginine did not prevent E2–5 from been acetylated by HATs (data not shown). Although acetylation of a protein frequently occurs at a site of multiple lysine residues (24Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S., La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 373: 691-694Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 29Sartorelli V. Puri P. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J. Kedes L. Mol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), the potential for individual lysine residue involvement can not be ruled out. Further mutagenesis combinations involving individual lysine residues might aid in determining the site of acetylation. HAT-mediated acetylation of a transcription factor may alter its DNA binding activity, ability to interact with other proteins, nuclear localization, and protein stability. For example, the acetylation of p53 and GATA1 leads to an increase in sequence-specific DNA binding and transcription activity (31Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar, 32Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar); acetylation of MyoD leads to a conformational change affecting its ability to recruit coactivators (29Sartorelli V. Puri P. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar); acetylation of HNF-4 leads to increased nuclear localization (25Soutoglou E. Katrakilli N. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar); and acetylation of E2F1 leads to an increase in DNA binding and protein stability (30Martinez-Balbas M. Bauer U. Nielsen S. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). We found that acetylation of E2A did not alter its ability to bind to E box-specific DNA (data not shown). Through transfection experiments we provided two points of evidence that HAT-E2A interaction affects E2A function. First, co-transfection of E2A with each HAT increases E2A-mediated transcription of a reporter gene. Second, transfection experiments have shown that E2A nuclear retention is substantially increased in the presence of HATs. For p300, this increased nuclear retention is dependent on the acetylation activity of p300. This result is consistent with the notion that nuclear retention of E2A may be affected by acetylation. However, our study did not formally rule out the possibility that nuclear retention of E2A is mediated by an unknown protein that is the target of acetylation by HAT. In fact, a moderate increase in E2A nuclear retention was observed with PCAF, which does not show significant acetylation activity toward E2A in transfected 293T cells. It is also possible that E2A may be acetylated at several sites by multiple HATs. Each acetylation may affect E2A function in a different way and in a cell type-dependent manner. Although the current work provided important clues, further investigations are required to determine which interaction and modification of E2A is directly relevant to B cell development. Genetic studies have shown that bone marrow B cells in E2A heterozygous mice are reduced to half the number maintained in wild-type littermates (2Zhuang Y. Sorian P. Weintraub H. Cell. 1994; 79: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Mice heterozygous for p300 demonstrate a similar gene dosage effect in embryogenesis, differentiation, and cell proliferation (28Yao T.P., Oh, S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T., Li, E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Our study has now shown a genetic interaction between these two genes in bone marrow B cell development. A similar type of genetic test has been used previously to confirm functional interaction between E2A and several other transcription factors present in B cells, including HEB, E2–2, and EBF (26Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27O'Riordan M. Grosschedl R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In all cases, a strong correlation between protein interaction and genetic interaction is observed. Although the dosage-dependent phenotype persists from neonates to adult for E2A heterozygous mice, the genetic interaction between E2A and p300 in the compound heterozygous mice was observed only in neonates and not in adults. One explanation for the recovery of B cell numbers in adult compound heterozygotes is the possible compensation for the loss of p300 by other histone acetyltransferases such as CBP, which shares considerable functional and sequence homology with p300 (33Kung A.L. Rebel V.I. Bronson R.T. Ch'ng L.E. Sieff C.A. Livingston D.M. Yao T.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 272-277PubMed Google Scholar). It has been recognized that lymphopoiesis in fetal and neonatal life is regulated differently than in the adult (34Rolink A Haasner D Nishikawa S. Melchers F. Blood. 1993; 81: 2290-2300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that although E2A is required for B cell development in both young and adult mice, its activity and specificity in regulating B cell-specific gene expression may be modulated by association with different HATs. The data provided in our study suggest that E2A interact with multiple HATs in B cells. It is conceivable that an individual HAT may be preferentially required for a certain aspect of E2A function at a certain stage of B cell development. It remains a challenge to determine the specificity of these HATs in regulating E2A activities in the context of specific E2A target genes during B cell development. The genetic data presented in this report provide not only the first physiological evidence that E2A and p300 collaboratively regulate bone marrow B cell development but also, more importantly, clues for where and when E2A and p300 interaction might have occurred in live animals.

This process involves multiple endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic steps (see Fig. 1 B) and is largely carried out in the nucleolus. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, enzymes directly involved in these reactions include the endonucleases RNase MRP and Rnt1p, the 5′ → 3′ exonuclease Rat1p, and 3′ → 5′ exonucleases, including the exosome complex, Rex1p, and Rex2p (1, 2; reviewed in Refs. 3Kressler D.

Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In addition to the RNA processing enzymes, around 110 other factors are known to be required for normal pre-rRNA processing in yeast. These include several small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) particles, putative RNA helicases, GTPases, and many other assembly factors (5Fatica A. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). It is very likely that these act to promote correct folding of the pre-rRNA, assembly of the ∼80 ribosomal proteins, and assembly/disassembly of the processing complexes, with processing inhibition arising as a secondary consequence of defects in the structure of the pre-ribosomal particles (see Refs. 3Kressler D.

Rnt1p, the exosome, and Rex proteins generate the 3′-ends of small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs (snRNAs and snoRNAs), whereas Xrn1p and Rat1p produce 5′-ends of intron-encoded and polycistronic snoRNAs (2van Hoof A.

Otherwise strains were grown in YPD medium. The lsm-Δ strains were pre-grown at 23 °C and transferred to 37 °C. RNA was extracted as described previously (38Tollervey D. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Northern hybridization and primer extension were as described previously (39Tollervey D.

Standard 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde and 6% acrylamide/urea gels were used to analyze the high and low molecular weight RNA species, respectively. For RNA hybridization and primer extension, the following oligonucleotides were used: 001 (27SA-2), 5′-CCAGTTACGAAAATTCTTG; 002 (20S-2), 5′-GCTCTTTGCTCTTGCC; 003 (27SA-3), 5′-TGTTACCTCTGGGCCC; 004 (20S), 5′-CGGTTTTAATTGTCCTA; 006 (27SB), 5′-GGCCAGCAATTTCAAGTTA; 007 (25S+40), 5′-CTCCGCTTATTGATATGC; 008 (18S+34), 5′-CATGGCTTAATCTTTGAGAC; 011 (18S+186), 5′-TCTCTTCCAAAGGGTCG; 013 (RNA2.1), 5′-AGATTAGCCGCAGTTGG; 017 (5.8S+30), 5′-GCGTTGTTCATCGATGC; 020 (ITS2–5′B), 5′-TGAGAAGGAAATGACGCT; 022 (25S/3′ETS), 5′-GAAATAAAAAACAAATCAGAC; 026 (5′ETS+911), 5′-CCAGATAACTATCTTAAAAG; 029 (18S+1785), 5′-TAATGATCCTTCCGCA; 030 (18S+668), 5′-TTGGAAATCCAGTACACG; 033 (5′ETS+278), 5′-CGCTGCTCACCAATGG; 053 (3′ETS+180), 5′-TGGTACACTCTTACACAC; 471 (SmX3), 5′-ACGCCTACACGATGGTTGACCAGGCCTTTGAGGA. Whole cells extracts were prepared as described (37Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B.

Affinity purification of TAP-tagged Lsm3p protein was performed as described (37Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar) with rabbit IgG-agarose beads (Sigma). Untagged isogenic strain (YJV140) was utilized as control. Immunoprecipitation from lysates of the HA::Lsm1 and isogenic wild-type (BMA64) strains was performed using rat monoclonal anti-HA high affinity Ab (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) bound to Protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Copurified RNAs were recovered by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Precursors and mature RNAs were identified by Northern hybridizations and primer extension analysis. Metabolic labeling of RNA was performed as described previously (41Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Carmo-Fonseca M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). TheGAL::lsm3 strain was pre-grown in galactose minimal medium lacking uracil and transferred to glucose minimal medium for 8.5 h. The isogenic WT strain (YJK53) was grown directly in glucose minimal medium. Cells at 0.3A 600 nm were labeled with [3H]uracil for 1 min followed by a chase with excess unlabeled uracil for 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 60 min. Pre-rRNA processing (Fig. 1) was assessed by pulse-chase labeling with [H3]uracil in theGAL-lsm3 strain in which expression of the essential Lsm3p was under GAL control. Cells were labeled with [3H]uracil for 1 min followed by a chase with excess unlabeled uracil for the times indicated (Fig. 2). Overall incorporation into pre-rRNA and rRNA was strongly reduced in the Lsm3p-depleted strain. Labeling was performed following growth on glucose medium for 8.5 h, prior to the appearance of any clear growth defect (27, 35, and data not shown), so the reduced incorporation is unlikely to be a simple consequence of growth inhibition. Early steps in pre-rRNA processing were strongly retarded in the Lsm3p-depleted strain, leading to substantial accumulation of the 35S pre-rRNA (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7–12). This was accompanied by a delay in the synthesis of the 27S and 20S pre-rRNAs. Little 27SA2 pre-RNA was synthesized in the mutant, so the 27SB pre-rRNA was presumably generated largely by cleavage at sites A3 and B1L. Mature 18S and 25S rRNAs were synthesized with considerable retardation, but their relative ratio was not clearly altered. Synthesis of the mature 5.8S rRNA was also strongly retarded in the GAL::lsm3strain (Fig. 2 B). The aberrant 23S RNA was detected together with other aberrant RNA intermediates (marked with asterisksin Fig. 2, A and B; see Fig. 1 C for the identities of aberrant pre-rRNA species seen in Lsm-depleted strains). We conclude that the depletion of Lsm3p inhibits pre-rRNA processing. The 35S pre-rRNA was present even after 60-min chase (Fig. 2 A, lane 12) and in other experiments was shown to persist at 2-, 4-, 6-, and 12-h chase time points (data not shown). This is probably a consequence of degradation of the labeled pre-rRNA and rRNAs in the Lsm3p-depleted strain, with subsequent re-incorporation of the labeled nucleotides, which cannot be chased by exogenous uracil. As previously reported (35Kufel J. Allmang C. Verdone L. Beggs J. Tollervey D. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2002; 22: 5248-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), synthesis of tRNAs was also retarded in the strain depleted of Lsm3p. Pre-rRNA processing was analyzed in more detail by Northern hybridization (Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). The essential Lsm proteins, Lsm2–5p and Lsm8p, were placed underGAL control (strainsGAL::lsm2,GAL::lsm3,GAL::lsm4,GAL::lsm5, andGAL::lsm8) (27Mayes A.E. Verdone L. Legrain P. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4321-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and depleted by transferring the strains from permissive RSG medium (0-h samples) to repressive glucose medium. The genes encoding non-essential Lsm proteins, Lsm1p and Lsm6–7p, were deleted, giving rise to temperature-sensitive strains (strains lsm1-Δ,lsm6-Δ, and lsm7-Δ) (27Mayes A.E. Verdone L. Legrain P. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4321-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which were grown in glucose medium at 23 °C (0-h samples) and transferred to the non-permissive temperature of 37 °C. Depletion of the essential Lsm proteins leads to depletion of the U6 snRNA and the inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing (19Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Lührmann R.

Inhibition of rRNA processing inlsm strains can potentially arise as a result of the splicing defect. Many r protein genes contain introns, and reduced r protein synthesis leads to the inhibition of ribosome synthesis (42Rosbash M. Harris P.K. Woolford J.L.J. Teem J.L.

G–I, comparison of low molecular weight pre-rRNA processing and accumulation of unspliced pre-U3 RNA (U3-int) and mature U3 in GAL-lsm3 (lanes 1–5) and GAL-syf3 strains (lanes 6–10). Strains were grown and RNA was prepared as described for Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Clear pre-rRNA processing defects were seen in theGAL::lsm2 to lsm5 andGAL::lsm8 strains at early times of depletion (shown for GAL::lsm3 in Fig. 3, the complete set of strains are shown for low molecular weight pre-rRNAs in Fig. 5). Even on galactose medium some elevation was seen in the level of the 35S pre-rRNA in theGAL::lsm3 strain, but other processing intermediates were present at wild-type levels. Processing was clearly defective 6 h after transfer to glucose medium, before the appearance of any detectable growth defect (27, 35, and data not shown). The 35S primary transcript was further elevated, accompanied by the appearance of the aberrant 23S RNA and depletion of the 27SA2 and 20S pre-rRNAs (Fig. 3, A–C). This phenotype is characteristic of the inhibition of pre-rRNA processing at sites A0 to A2. The level of the 27SB pre-rRNA was less strongly reduced at 6 h but was clearly reduced at later time points (Fig. 3 D), as were the mature 25S and 18S rRNAs (Fig. 3 E). In addition to the loss of the normal pre-rRNA processing intermediates, there was a dramatic accumulation of aberrant pre-rRNAs in the Lsm3p and other Lsm-depleted strains. These included the 23S and 21S RNAs, which have been seen in several other pre-rRNA processing mutants, as well as many unusual intermediates, some of which are indicated in Fig. 1 C. These included fragments extending from the 5′-end of the transcript to site D (5′ETS-D), from A1 to B1, and from site D to the 3′-end of the 25S rRNA (d-B2) (Fig. 3; see also Fig. 1 C). None of these species have been observed in the wild-type or reported for previously characterized pre-rRNA processing mutants. The appearance of these RNAs indicates that processing events in the 5′-ETS, ITS1, and ITS2 do not occur in the normal order following depletion of the Lsm complex. Additionally, a set of truncated and heterogeneous pre-rRNA-derived species, which are presumed to be degradation intermediates, strongly accumulated upon depletion of each of the essential Lsm proteins (bracketed and indicated with an asterisk in Fig. 3). Degradation intermediates were readily observed with probes directed against each of the pre-rRNA spacer regions, and the total signal for these heterogeneous species was equal to or greater than the pre-rRNAs in the wild-type strain, indicating substantial degradation of all regions of the pre-rRNA (Fig. 3 and data not shown). In addition, probes against the mature 18S and 25S rRNAs detected fragments apparently derived from their breakdown (Figs.3 E and 4). Following transfer of the GAL::prp45(data not shown) or GAL::syf3 strain (Fig. 3) to glucose medium, the time course and degree of pre-mRNA splicing inhibition was comparable to the Lsm3p-depleted strain (see Fig. 5 I below) and pre-rRNA processing was inhibited, with accumulation of 35S, 23S, and 21S species and reduced levels of 27SA2 20S pre-rRNAs. However, the pre-rRNA processing defect was distinctly different from that seen on Lsm3p depletion. In particular, no accumulation of aberrant intermediates or breakdown products was observed in the GAL-syf3 strain, and levels of the 20S pre-rRNA and mature rRNAs were not strongly reduced, probably because growth is inhibited for other reasons allowing a reduced rate of ribosome synthesis to maintain normal rRNA levels at the reduced growth rate. Depletion of Lsm1–7p (but not Lsm8p) also reduces 5′ degradation of cytoplasmic mRNA (32Tharun S., He, W. Mayes A.E. Lennertz P. Beggs J.D. Parker R. Nature. 2000; 404: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Strains carrying thexrn1-Δ or dcp1-Δ mutations, which also inhibit mRNA 5′ degradation (16Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), have been extensively studied and do not result in pre-rRNA processing defects that resemble those seen in the Lsm-depleted strains (46, 47, and data not shown).

Cell. 2000; 102: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), which is simultaneously inhibited for splicing and mRNA turnover, also failed to show such defects (data not shown). We conclude that the inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA turnover does not generally lead to the pre-rRNA turnover defects seen upon Lsm protein depletion. It remains formally possible that specific defects"
https://openalex.org/W2016786613,"Iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) is a cytosolic RNA-binding protein that is a regulator of iron homeostasis in mammalian cells. IRP-1 binds to RNA structures, known as iron-responsive elements, located in the untranslated regions of specific mRNAs, and it regulates the translation or stability of these mRNAs. Iron regulates IRP-1 activity by converting it from an RNA-binding apoprotein into a [4Fe-4S] cluster protein exhibiting aconitase activity. IRP-1 is widely found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here, we report the biochemical characterization and regulation of an IRP-1 homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans(GEI-22/ACO-1). GEI-22/ACO-1 is expressed in the cytosol of cells of the hypodermis and the intestine. Like mammalian IRP-1/aconitases, GEI-22/ACO-1 exhibits aconitase activity and is post-translationally regulated by iron. Although GEI-22/ACO-1 shares striking resemblance to mammalian IRP-1, it fails to bind RNA. This is consistent with the lack of iron-responsive elements in the C. elegans ferritin genes, ftn-1 and ftn-2. While mammalian ferritin H and L mRNAs are translationally regulated by iron, the amounts of C. elegans ftn-1 and ftn-2 mRNAs are increased by iron and decreased by iron chelation. Excess iron did not significantly alter worm development but did shorten their life span. These studies indicated that iron homeostasis in C. elegans shares some similarities with those of vertebrates.

These studies indicated that iron homeostasis in C. elegans shares some similarities with those of vertebrates. iron regulatory protein iron-responsive element untranslated region nematode growth medium ferric ammonium citrate deferoxamine green fluorescent protein Iron is an essential element required for growth and survival of most organisms. The importance of iron is implicit in the role it plays in oxygen transport and heme synthesis as well as its ability to serve as a cofactor for enzymes involved in a variety of biological processes including DNA synthesis, energy production, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Abnormally high concentration of cellular iron is toxic due to its ability to catalyze the generation of free radicals that damage DNA, lipids, and proteins. In humans, the accumulation of excess cellular iron can result in cirrhosis, arthritis, cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and increased risk of cancer and heart disease. To provide adequate iron for cellular needs yet prevent the accumulation of excess iron, the concentration of iron within cells is tightly controlled. In vertebrates, the iron regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP-1 and IRP-2)1 regulate iron homeostasis. IRPs are cytosolic RNA-binding proteins that regulate the translation or the stability of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in iron and energy homeostasis (1Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Google Scholar, 2Eisenstein R.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 627-662Google Scholar, 3Schneider B.S. Leibold E.A. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2000; 3: 267-273Google Scholar, 4Theil E.C. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40659-40662Google Scholar). IRPs bind to RNA stem-loop structures, known as iron-responsive elements (IREs), that are located in either the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of specific mRNAs. These mRNAs encode proteins involved in iron storage (ferritin), iron utilization (erythroid aminolevilunate synthase and mitochondrial aconitase), and iron transport (transferrin receptor and divalent metal transporter-1). When iron is scarce, IRP binding to the 5′ IRE in ferritin mRNA represses translation, whereas IRP binding to the 3′ IREs in the transferrin receptor mRNA stabilizes this mRNA. When iron is abundant, IRPs lose affinity for the IREs, leading to enhanced ferritin synthesis and to the rapid degradation of transferrin receptor mRNA. By regulating the amount of iron taken up by transferrin receptor and the amount of iron sequestered by ferritin, cellular iron concentration is maintained, and iron toxicity is avoided. Iron regulates the RNA binding activity of IRP-1 and IRP-2, but the mechanism of regulation differs. In the presence of iron, a [4Fe-4S] cluster assembles in IRP-1, converting it from an RNA-binding protein into a cytosolic aconitase. Aconitases are [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins that are found in the cytosol, mitochondria, and glyoxysomes and catalyze the reversible isomerization of citrate and isocitrate viacis-aconitate (5Gruer M.J. Artymiuk P.J. Guest J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 3-6Google Scholar). Despite information regarding the role of aconitase in mitochondria and in the glyoxylate cycle in microorganisms and plants, the function of cytosolic aconitase in higher eukaryotes is not clear. Unlike IRP-1, IRP-2 lacks a [4Fe-4S] cluster and consequently lacks aconitase activity (6Guo B., Yu, Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Google Scholar). Rather, iron regulation of IRP-2 involves iron-induced IRP2 degradation by the proteasome (7Guo B. Phillips J.D., Yu, Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Google Scholar, 8Iwai K.

For example, mammalian IRP-1s are >90% identical and are highly homologous to IRP-1s from other organisms, includingCaenorhabditis elegans (64% identity) (16Muckenthaler M. Gunkel N. Frishman D. Cyrklaff A. Tomancak P. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 230-237Google Scholar),Arabidopsis thaliana (59% identity) plants (13Peyret P. Perez P. Alric M. J. Biol.

In contrast, IRP-1s share only ∼20% amino acid identity to mitochondrial aconitases. Although these IRP-1s show striking similarity to mammalian IRP-1 and in most cases exhibit aconitase activity, only vertebrate and insect IRP-1s (18Rothenberger S. Mullner E.W. Kühn L.C.

Exceptions are Bacillus subtilisand Plasmodium falciparum IRP-1s, where studies show that these proteins are capable of binding to a mammalian consensus IRE (11Alen C. Sonenshein A.L. Proc. Natl.

Blood. 2001; 15: 2555-2562Google Scholar). Here, we report on the biochemical properties and regulation ofC. elegans cytosolic aconitase (GEI-22/ACO-1). C. elegans is a multicellular organism that shares many basic cellular mechanisms with vertebrates, and consequently, it has been used to study development, neurobiology, stress, and aging. Many of the same genes that are involved in iron and energy homeostasis in vertebrates are conserved in C. elegans, including aconitases, ferritin, divalent metal transporter-1, frataxin, and iron sulfur cluster assembly proteins, suggesting that iron and energy homeostasis are also conserved. These features prompted us to characterize the biochemical properties and the regulation of GEI-22/ACO-1 and mechanisms regulating iron homeostasis in C. elegans. Wild-type C. elegans (variety Bristol, strain N2) were cultivated on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates or in large scale liquid cultures seeded with E. coli strain OP50 at 22 °C (23Sulston J.E. Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 95-104Google Scholar). For large scale cultures, mixed stage worms were placed in complete S-basal medium (500 ml) containing OP50 bacteria (15 g) and grown until the bacteria were gone. S-basal medium was supplemented with 0.003–6.6 mg/ml ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) or 100 μm deferoxamine (DF), an iron chelator. Because FAC lowered the pH of S-basal medium, it was adjusted to pH 7.0. Worms were grown for 4 days with gentle shaking at 180 rpm and were collected and washed free of bacteria by sucrose flotation. The toxic concentration of FAC and DF was determined by iron toxicity assays (see below) and by growth of worms in different DF concentrations followed by assaying worm survival. RNA for Northern blots was made from L4 worms prepared by alkaline hypochlorite of gravid adults (24Sulston J. Hodgkins J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 603-605Google Scholar). Embryos were grown on NGM agar plates (12 × 60-mm plates) supplemented with FAC (0.003–6.6 mg/ml) and adjusted to pH 7.0 or DF (100 μm) for 4 days at 22 °C. DF-supplemented plates were prepared by seeding NGM plates with 0.1 ml of OP50 bacteria (380 mg/ml) to which 100 μmDF was added. For iron toxicity life span analysis, 10 L4 larval stage worms were placed on NGM agar plates supplemented with FAC (0.03–6.6 mg/ml) at 22 °C. Each day, the worms were moved to a new plate and were scored as dead if they failed to move when provoked or lacked pharyngeal pumping. Three distinct experiments were carried out, with 10 worms in each experiment. Statistical comparisons were made using a Cox regression model testing for trend in survival explained by the dose of iron. C. elegans gei-22/aco-1 cDNA was synthesized from RNA isolated from mixed stage worms using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed usingPfu polymerase and an upstream primer containing aKpnI site followed by the first 18 nt of thegei-22/aco-1 coding sequence (5′-GCGCGGTACCGCCATGCGTTTCAACAACCTT-3′) and a downstream primer containing the last 18 nt of gei-22/aco-1 coding region in frame with a FLAG epitope, a stop codon, and anXbaI site (5′-GCGCTCTAGATTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTTGGATCAACTTTCTGATCAT-3′). These primers were chosen based on the alignment of the GEI-22/ACO-1 amino acid sequence predicted from the ZK455.1 with those of other IRP-1s using the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment program (Fig. 1). The 2.9-kb fragment was cloned into the KpnI-XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), yielding the mammalian expression construct pACO-1FLAG. A translational green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct GEI-22/ACO-1::GFP was constructed by digesting ZK455.1 withEco47III-NruI and inserting the 3,895-bp fragment into the SmaI site of the promoterless GFP reporter vector pPD95.77 (Dr. Andrew Fire). This construct contained 939 nt of 5′ regulatory sequences and 2.9 kb of gei-22/aco-1coding and intronic sequences (7 introns) fused in frame to GFP. The construct lacks sequences encoding the last 110 amino acids of GEI-1/ACO-1 and the 3′-UTR, resulting in a nonfunctional protein. pGFP-ACO-1 (30 ng/μl) was co-injected with pRF4 DNA (30 ng/μl) containing a dominant mutant gene for rol-6 allele, and transformed worms were selected by their rolling behavior. Four transgenic worms were generated, and all showed the same GFP expression pattern. A His8 tag was cloned onto the N terminus of pACO-1FLAG, and the insert was subcloned into theKpnI-XbaI sites of pYes2 (Invitrogen), yielding the yeast expression construct pYhis-ACO-1FLAG. pYhis-ACO-1FLAG was transformed into yeast strain JEL1 (25Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Google Scholar). Yeast were grown overnight in synthetic complete medium minus uracil (SC-Ura−) containing 2% dextrose. Yeast were then diluted 1:100 into SC-Ura− containing 3% glycerol, 2.0% lactic acid and grown to an A 600 of 0.8. 2% galactose was added to the culture for 10–18 h to induce GEI-22/ACO-1 expression. Yeasts were harvested, and the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml/g, wet weight, lysis extraction buffer (0.3 m NaCl, 0.05m NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were disrupted by vortexing with glass beads, and the lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × gfor 30 min. The lysate was mixed with 2.0 ml of equilibrated Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The slurry was poured into a column and was washed with column buffer (0.3 m NaCl, 0.05 mNaH2PO4, pH 8.0) containing 0.07 mimidazole. GEI-22/ACO-1 was eluted with column buffer containing 0.2m imidazole, and fractions containing GEI-22/ACO-1 were dialyzed against assay buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.3, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). For antibody preparation, GEI-22/ACO-1 was further purified by preparative 8% SDS-PAGE. The protein was visualized using a cold solution of 2.5m KCl, and the band containing GEI-22/ACO-1 was excised and used to inject rabbits. The polyclonal antibodies detected a band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa, which corresponds to the size of the predicted gene product ofgei-22/aco-1 mRNA. Preimmune serum did not detect this band. A 10-cm plate of HEK 293 cells was cotransfected with 8 μg of pACO-1FLAG and 2 μg of pEGFP (Clontech) DNAs. The cells were equally split after 5 h to six 35-mm plates, and duplicate plates received either FAC (50 μg/ml) or DF (50 μm) or no addition. The cells were incubated for 16 h and then harvested in 0.125 ml of lysis buffer (0.02 mHEPES, pH 7.6, 0.025 m KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was assayed for protein using the Coomassie Blue Plus Protein Reagent (Pierce). Worms were harvested from 500-ml cultures containing 0.33 mg/ml FAC or 100 μm DF. The worms were washed free of bacteria by sucrose flotation and suspended in a 2× volume of homogenization buffer (0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.32 m NH4SO4) containing a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysates were homogenized on ice using a Brinkmann Instruments Polytron homogenizer at full power for 15 s, repeated seven times. The homogenates were centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatants were assayed for protein using the Coomassie Blue Plus protein reagent (Pierce). RNA-binding assays were performed as described (26Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Google Scholar), using protein (12 μg) from yeast, HEK 293 cells, or C. elegans lysates and a32P-labeled rat ferritin L-IRE (R. norvegicus fer-l) (25Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Google Scholar) or a C. elegans ferritin-2 (ftn-2) RNA. The ftn-2 RNA was synthesized from DNA that corresponded to 530 nt 5′ to the start codon offtn-2 gene (C. elegans cosmid D1037.3). The forward primer contained a T7 promoter sequence (19 nt) followed by 20 nt of ftn-2 sequence (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGTTGAAGCATAATACTATTACG-3′), and the reverse primer contained the first 20 nt 5′ to the start site inftn-2 (5′-GGTAGTTTGTGGCTGGTAAG-3′). After incubation of the RNA-protein complexes for 20 min, RNase T1 (1 unit) was added to the reaction for 5 min followed by the addition of 1.5 μg of heparin (50 mg/ml) for 5 min. A 5% native polyacrylamide gel was used to resolve the RNA-protein complexes. Aconitase assays were performed using lysates obtained from worms and from HEK 293 cells transfected with pcACO-1FLAG. Aconitase activity was assayed by the addition of cis-aconitate (0.2 mmfinal concentration) to 50 μg of protein in 0.5 ml of aconitase buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl) (27Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Google Scholar). The disappearance of cis-aconitate was measured at 240 nm over time. For aconitase assays in worms, four separate experiments were carried out. The differences between FAC- and DF-treated worms were determined by paired Student's t test, andp < 0.05 was considered significant. Protein from HEK 293 cells (50 μg), yeast (20 μg), and worms (50 μg) was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and the protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-FLAG (Sigma) (1:5,000), rabbit anti-GEI-22/ACO-1 (1:5,000), mouse anti-GFP (1:2,000), chicken anti-Rattus norvegicus IRP-1 (1:6,000) (6Guo B., Yu, Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Google Scholar), and rabbit anti-R. norvegicus IRP-2 (1:8,000) (6Guo B., Yu, Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Google Scholar). The appropriate goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) were used at 1:10,000. Antibodies were visualized using the Renaissance detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total RNA was isolated from age-synchronized L4 worms grown on FAC (0.003–6.6 mg/ml)-supplemented or DF (100 μm)-supplemented NGM plates for 4 days. Worms (∼100 mg) were homogenized in TRIzol (1 ml) using a Dounce homogenizer. Total RNA (25 μg) was resolved using a 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled C. elegans ftn-1, ftn-2, gei-22/aco-1, andact-1 DNA probes prepared by the amplification of worm genomic DNA. DNA templates for amplification were prepared by washing worms in PCR lysis buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween 20, 0.01% gelatin). The worms were placed in 25 μl of lysis buffer containing proteinase K (1 mg/ml) for 1 h at 65 °C followed by a 15-min incubation at 95 °C. The lysate (1 μl) was added to a PCR (50 μl) containing 20 μm of the appropriate forward and reverse primers. Forward and reverse primers, respectively, for PCR were obtained from sequences of the following C. elegans cosmid clones: ftn-1(C54F6.14), 5′-ACGTAGAACTCTACGCCTCC-3′ and 5′-CTCCGAGTCCTGGGCCGG-3′; ftn-2 (D1037.3), 5′-TCCGAGGTTGAAGCTGCC-3′ and 5′-CGGAAAAGTGTTCCTTATCG-3′; andact-1 (TO4C12.6), 5′-GACAATCCATCCGGAATGTGCAAGGCC-3′ and 5′-GAAGCACTTGCGGTGAATGGAT-3′. A probe forgei-22/aco-1 was obtained by excising the DNA insert from pACO-1FLAG. PCRs were resolved on 1% agarose gels, and the DNA bands were purified and 32P-labeled using the RadPrime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen). 32P-Labeled DNA was hybridized with membranes for 18 h at 42 °C and washed with 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 50 °C. Band intensity was normalized toact-1 and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. The C. elegans genome possesses two aconitase genes, which are designatedgei-22/aco-1 and aco-2. gei-22/aco-1 encodes a protein that shares ∼63% identity with mammalian IRP-1 (16Muckenthaler M. Gunkel N. Frishman D. Cyrklaff A. Tomancak P. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 230-237Google Scholar), D. melanogaster IRP-1A and 1B (16Muckenthaler M. Gunkel N. Frishman D. Cyrklaff A. Tomancak P. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 230-237Google Scholar), and A. thaliana (13Peyret P. Perez P. Alric M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8131-8137Google Scholar) and T. brucei(17Saas J. Ziegelbauer K. von Haeseler A. Fast B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2745-2755Google Scholar) IRP-1s while sharing only ∼24% identity to porcine (28Zheng L. Andrews P.C. Hermodson M.A. Dixon J.E. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2814-2821Google Scholar) andC. elegans mitochondrial aconitases (Fig. 1). aco-2 encodes a protein that shares ∼74% identity to human and porcine mitochondrial aconitases. To study the iron homeostasis in C. elegans, agei-22/aco-1 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using sequences obtained from the C. elegans cosmid clone ZK455.1. GEI-22/ACO-1 contains all 24 active-site residues required for aconitase activity, including the 3 cysteines that serve as ligands for the [4Fe-4S] cluster (29Robbins A.H. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3639-3643Google Scholar, 30Robbins A.H. Stout C.D. Proteins. 1989; 1989: 289-312Google Scholar, 31Lauble H. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Stout C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2735-2748Google Scholar). GEI-22/ACO-1 also contains residues that are similar to those identified in mammalian IRP-1 implicated in RNA binding, including amino acids 121–130, 685–689, and 732–737 (32Basilion J.P. Rouault T.A. Massinople C.M. Klausner R.D. Burgess W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 574-578Google Scholar, 33Kaldy P. Menotti E. Moret R. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6073-6083Google Scholar). The expression pattern of GEI-22/ACO-1 in living worms was determined using GFP-reporter fusions constructs. Agei-22/aco-1::GFPtranslational fusion gene was made that contained ∼1 kb of 5′ regulatory sequences and 2.9 kb of coding and intronic sequences ofgei-22/aco-1 fused in-frame to gfp(Fig. 2 A). This construct lacks 3′-UTR sequences and those encoding the last 110 amino acids GEI-22/ACO-1. Transgenic embryos, L2 larval stage, and adult animals carrying the reporter construct showed high levels of cytosolic GFP expression in the hypodermal seam cells and in the intestine (Fig. 2,B–D). No significant GFP expression was observed in muscle cells or in neurons. Mammalian IRP-1 exhibits the mutually exclusive activities of RNA binding and aconitase. Iron causes IRP-1 to switch from an RNA-binding apoprotein form to a non-RNA binding aconitase form containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The switch between these forms occurs without changes in IRP-1 protein levels. Since GEI-22/ACO-1 shows significant amino acid identity with mammalian IRP-1, we questioned whether GEI-22/ACO-1 binds RNA. The 5′ sequences flanking the C. elegans genes encoding ferritin-1 (C. elegans FTN-1) and ferritin-2 (C. elegans FTN-2), succinate dehydrogenase, and ACO-2 were inspected for IREs, since 5′ IREs are found in homologous genes in other organisms (19Kohler S.A. Henderson B.R. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30781-30786Google Scholar, 34Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7335-7341Google Scholar, 35Hentze M.W. Caughman S.W. Rouault T.A. Barriocanal J.G. Dancis A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1987; 238: 1570-1573Google Scholar, 36Zheng L. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Zalkin H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 356-360Google Scholar). No consensus IREs was identified in these genes. It was possible, however, that nonconsensus IREs might be present in the 5′-UTRs of these genes. To test for this, IRE binding activity was measured in extracts of worms grown in FAC or the iron chelator DF using 32P-labeled RNAs corresponding to sequences located ∼500 nt upstream of the start site of the ftn-1, ftn-2, aco-2, and succinate dehydrogenase genes. Since C. elegans exons and introns are generally shorter than in vertebrates (37Blumenthal T. Steward K. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. Elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 117-145Google Scholar), we reasoned that if these genes harbor 5′-IREs, then they should be present within these sequences. Worms were grown in FAC- or DF-supplemental medium, because previous studies showed that FAC and DF can decrease and increase, respectively, IRP-1 RNA binding activity (1Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Google Scholar, 2Eisenstein R.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 627-662Google Scholar, 4Theil E.C. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40659-40662Google Scholar). The concentration of FAC and DF was chosen based on testing the growth of worms in different concentrations of FAC and DF (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3 B shows that no specific RNA binding activity was detected in worm extracts by RNA-band shift gels with the 32P-labeled ftn-2RNA or with other 32P-labeled C. elegans RNAs (data not shown), although GEI-22/ACO-1 was detected in these extracts by immunoblotting using an anti-GEI-22/ACO-1 antibody (Fig. 3 C). As controls, HEK 293 cells were treated with FAC or DF, and IRP RNA binding activity was measured using the32P-labeled R. norvegicus fer-l IRE (Fig. 3 A). DF increased IRP RNA binding activity as expected, whereas FAC had little effect on IRP RNA binding activity due to the high iron concentration in these cells. No RNA-protein complexes were formed with a 32P-labeled R. norvegicus fer-l IRE in worm extracts (Fig. 3 A). C. elegans extracts spiked with R. norvegicus IRP-1 showed that 32P-labeled R. norvegicus fer-l IRE bound to R. norvegicus IRP-1, indicating that an inhibitor of RNA binding activity was not present in these extracts (data not shown). To confirm that GEI-22/ACO-1 lacks RNA binding activity, we expressed His/FLAG-tagged GEI-22/ACO-1 in yeast using a galactose-inducible promoter. The advantage of yeast is that they do not express endogenous IRPs, which might interfere with the detection of small amounts of RNA binding activity. As controls, yeast strains expressing His-taggedR. norvegicus IRP-1 and IRP-2 were also assayed for RNA binding activity. Galactose induced the expression of GEI-22/ACO-1,R. norvegicus IRP-1, and R. norvegicus IRP-2, but only R. norvegicus IRP-1 and R. norvegicus IRP-2 bound to the R. norvegicus fer-l IRE (Fig. 4, A and B). Taken together, these data indicate that GEI-22/ACO-1 does not bind to a mammalian consensus IRE or to C. elegans RNAs that might be expected to harbor functional IREs. The data indicate that GEI-22/ACO-1 lacks RNA binding activity. The 24 active sites in mitochondrial aconitases (29Robbins A.H. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3639-3643Google Scholar, 30Robbins A.H. Stout C.D. Proteins. 1989; 1989: 289-312Google Scholar, 31Lauble H. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Stout C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2735-2748Google Scholar) are present in GEI-22/ACO-1, suggesting that GEI-22/ACO-1 is an aconitase. To determine whether GEI-22/ACO-1 exhibits aconitase activity and whether it is regulated by iron, total aconitase activity was measured in HEK 293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged GEI-22/ACO-1 or pcDNA3 control. Some cells were treated with either FAC or DF for 16 h before assaying aconitase activity. Cells transfected with FLAG-tagged GEI-22/ACO-1 showed a ∼2-fold increase in total aconitase activity compared with pcDNA3-transfected cells (Fig. 5 A). When cells were treated with FAC, total aconitase activity increased ∼4-fold in GEI-22/ACO-1-transfected cells compared with pcDNA3- transfected cells. Endogenous aconitase activity did not significantly increase in pcDNA3-transfected cells treated with FAC, indicating that these cells are iron-sufficient, and that the majority of IRP-1 is in the aconitase form. In contrast, DF dramatically reduced aconitase activity in GEI-22/ACO-1- and pcDNA3-transfected cells. The decreased aconitase activity observed in pcDNA3-transfected cells is due to decreased endogenous cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitase activities. GEI-22/ACO-1 was expressed at similar levels in all extracts, suggesting that the change in aconitase activity was due to the post-translational conversion of the apoprotein form to the [4Fe-4S] form (Fig. 5 B). The fact that iron caused a ∼3-fold increase in aconitase activity in GEI-22/ACO-1-transfected cells compared with GEI-22/ACO-1-untreated cells suggested that iron is limiting under conditions of overexpression.

Each A-tubule of the doublet contains a specialized “ribbon” of three protofilaments composed of tubulin and other proteins postulated to specify the three-dimensional arrangement of the various axonemal components. The interdoublet links hold the doublet microtubules together and limit their sliding during the flagellar beat. In this study on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we cloned a cDNA encoding a 71,985-Da polypeptide with three DM10 repeats, two C-terminal EF-hand motifs, and homologs extending to humans. This polypeptide, designated as Rib72, is a novel component of the ribbon compartment of flagellar microtubules. It remained associated with 9-fold arrays of doublet tubules following extraction under high and low ionic conditions, and anti-Rib72 antibodies revealed an ∼96-nm periodicity along axonemes, consistent with Rib72 associating with interdoublet links. Following proteolysis- and ATP-dependent disintegration of axonemes, the rate of cleavage of Rib72 correlated closely with the rate of sliding disintegration. These observations identify a ribbon-associated protein that may function in the structural assembly of the axoneme and in the mechanism and regulation of ciliary and flagellar motility.

Encyclopedia of Life Sciences. 2000; (http://www.els.net)Google Scholar). In mice and humans, mutations affecting cilia lead to a variety of phenotypes, including abnormalities in left-right axis development (e.g. situs inversus), blindness, male sterility, polycystic kidney disease, polydactyly, and respiratory and liver diseases (2Nonaka S.

This study describes a flagellar microtubule-associated protein that has been contemporaneously discovered and studied by three laboratories. The timely and detailed studies of this previously unknown protein now shed light on its role in the structural assembly of the ciliary axoneme and in the mechanism and regulation of motility. Cilia and flagella are composed of ∼250 different polypeptides, whose assembly is nucleated by a modified centriole, the basal body, to form a membrane-bound axoneme (6Dutcher S.K. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 398-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The three-dimensionally precise and complex structure of the axoneme is essential to its function,e.g. the propagation of regular bending waves. In most eukaryotes, the axoneme is composed of nine outer doublet microtubules, two central singlet microtubules, and numerous axoneme-associated components. Outer dynein arms, inner dynein arms, radial spokes, and interdoublet links are bound at precise points both around and along the A-microtubule, with axial spacings characteristic of each of the different components and species. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, outer dynein arms are attached to docking sites with axial repeats of 24-nm intervals (7Takada S. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Takada S. Wilkerson C.G. Wakabayashi K. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13 (K.): 1015-1029KCrossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Radial spokes and inner dynein arms have more complex subspacings, but have an overall axial repeat of 96 nm (9Goodenough U.W. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Mastronarde D.N. O'Toole E.T. McDonald K.L. McIntosh J.R. Porter M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1145-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These spacings are multiples of the 8-nm tubulin dimer repeat; however, it is unlikely in Chlamydomonas, with only one isoform each of α- and β-tubulin (11Silflow C.D. Chisholm R.L. Conner T.W. Ranum L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 12James S.W. Silflow C.D. Stroom P. Lefebvre P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 209-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that the tubulin lattice alone provides the three-dimensional spatial information for the binding of all the different axonemal components. How the evolutionarily conserved and precise structure of the axoneme is formed remains an intriguing and important question. This question has been partially addressed by evidence implicating a unique feature of the A-microtubule as a scaffold for the three-dimensional architecture of the axoneme. In organisms as divergent as protists (Chlamydomonas), echinoderms, and mollusks, extraction of doublet microtubules with the detergent Sarkosyl causes the breakdown of A-microtubules into “ribbons” of three adjoining protofilaments, as seen by electron microscopy (13Meza I.

S. A. 1992; 89: 8567-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Chen R. Perrone C.A. Amos L.A. Linck R.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 909-918PubMed Google Scholar, 21Norrander J.M. Perrone C.A.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8912-8918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chemical cross-linking studies demonstrated that three polypeptides, tektins A, B, and C, remain as extended ≤5-nm diameter filaments after extraction of the ribbons with 2 m urea (23Pirner M.A. Linck R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31800-31806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies indicated that a tektin polymer forms one of the protofilaments of the ribbons and A-microtubules, approximately in the section of the wall to which the radial spokes and inner B-tubule wall are attached (24Nojima D. Linck R.W. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 158-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Other studies indicated that tektin A, which has a dramatic steady-state turnover rate in ciliated epithelia, may assemble into the ribbon of pre-existing doublet microtubules (25Stephens R.E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Tektins and ribbons have observed and/or predicted axial periodicities of 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 nm (17Linck R.W. Miller K.R. Advances in Cell Biology. Jai Press Ltd., London1990: 35-63Google Scholar, 21Norrander J.M. Perrone C.A. Amos L.A. Linck R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Nojima D. Linck R.W.

Suppl. 1986; 5: 55-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations led to the hypothesis that tektin filaments act as molecular rulers that relay spatial information for the binding of axonemal components within the axoneme. Associated with the ribbons ofChlamydomonas flagella are polypeptides of 43 and ∼70 kDa. The Rib43a protein and RIB43a gene have been characterized (18Norrander J.M. deCathelineau A.M. Brown J.A. Porter M.E. Linck R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rib43a has homologs in species ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila to human; and although it does have a coiled-coil structure similar to half a tektin subunit, it has no primary sequence homology to tektins. Further studies of ribbons and their components will likely provide important insights into the assembly and function of cilia and flagella. Ciliary and flagellar beating is based on localized sliding between adjacent outer doublet microtubules that oscillate back and forth within a certain distance (27Brokaw C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1201-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, the outer doublets, while remaining connected to each other, must have the freedom to undergo shearing motion over a limited length. The classic experiment by Summers and Gibbons (28Summers K.E. Gibbons I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) showed that, when ATP is added to fragmented axonemes of sea urchin sperm after brief trypsin treatment, axonemes disintegrate via sliding of the outer doublet microtubules. Subsequent work by Sale and Satir (29Sale W.S. Satir P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the dynein-mediated sliding occurs in a polar minus-end direction. Summers and Gibbons (28Summers K.E. Gibbons I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) suggested that trypsin disrupts the structure connecting adjacent outer doublet microtubules while leaving the force generator dynein functionally intact. An interdoublet microtubule connection was thought to have the function of limiting the sliding distance and thus converting sliding to bending; proteolytic disruption of this structure presumably allows limitless sliding. In fact, electron microscope studies indicated that interdoublet links and radial spokes are rapidly lost due to the proteolysis, whereas dynein persists for some time (30Summers K.E. Gibbons I.R. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 58: 618-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The interdoublet links, also called nexin links, seem to be more fundamental than radial spokes for axoneme function because later studies with Chlamydomonas mutants indicated that axonemes can beat without radial spokes under certain conditions (31Huang B. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J.L. Cell. 1982; 28: 115-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 32Omoto C.K. Yagi T. Kurimoto E. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 33: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We may thus expect that the interdoublet links are essential both for maintaining the axonemal structure and for producing regular bending waves. However, despite the expected functional importance of interdoublet links, little is known about their molecular identity and properties. Some studies suggest that the link is highly elastic and stretchable (33Warner F.D. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 20: 101-114PubMed Google Scholar, 34Olson G.E. Linck R.W. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1977; 61: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas other studies suggest that it can reversibly detach from the outer doublets and thus is not necessarily elastic (35Warner F.D. Cell Motil. 1983; 3: 321-332Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Bozkurt H.H. Woolley D.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additional studies indicated that adjacent outer doublets are indeed connected by an elastic component (37Yagi T. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38Minoura I. Yagi T. Kamiya R. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and yet the connection can reversibly detach from the outer doublets (38Minoura I. Yagi T. Kamiya R. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Clearly, more information must be obtained regarding the molecules that constitute the interdoublet link. The study reported here started independently in our two laboratories, one aiming at characterizing the ∼70-kDa ribbon component and the other aiming at a protein constituting or associated with the interdoublet links. To our surprise, our laboratories arrived at the same protein. We report here the characterization of a 72-kDa ribbon-associated protein that potentially functions in the structural assembly of the axoneme and in maintaining the linkage of the nine outer doublet microtubules during dynein-mediated sliding and flagellar beating. Our results extend those of Patel-King et al. (39Patel-King R.S. Benashski S.E. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34271-34279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), who also reported the predicted structure of the 72-kDa protein and postulated it to be a regulatory subunit of a nucleoside-diphosphate kinase. The cell strains used in this study were C. reinhardtii wild-type 137c, oda1lacking the outer arm dynein (40Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and pf14 lacking the radial spokes (41Piperno G. Huang B. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 21 or 25 °C in Tris acetate/phosphate medium (42Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) with aeration under a 12/12-h light/dark cycle or in rich medium containing sodium acetate and additional potassium phosphate under continuous light (43Witman G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 44King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Flagellar axonemes were isolated by the dibucaine method of Witman et al. (45Witman G. Plummer J. Sander G. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) or by the pH shock method of Witman et al. (14Witman G.B. Carlson K. Berliner J. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 54: 507-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 15Witman G.B. Carlson K. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 54: 540-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Flagella were demembranated to yield axonemes by extraction with Nonidet P-40 in HMDEK solution (30 mm HEPES, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mmDTT,1 1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.4) or in HSSD solution (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm SrCl2, 4% sucrose, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5). Axonemes were finally resuspended in HMDEK solution or purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation (14Witman G.B. Carlson K. Berliner J. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 54: 507-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 43Witman G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 44King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and resuspended in HSSD solution. Flagellar axonemes were extracted with high ionic strength solution (HMDEK solution plus 0.6 m KCl) for 30 min at 4 °C. The suspension was then dialyzed overnight against low ionic strength solution (2 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mmDTT, pH 7.4). The integrity of the extracted axonemes was observed by dark-field microscopy. The extracted axonemes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the pellet and supernatant for SDS-PAGE analysis. Axonemes were fractionated into protofilament ribbons as previously described (18Norrander J.M. deCathelineau A.M. Brown J.A. Porter M.E. Linck R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with the modifications described under “Results.” Sliding disintegration of axonemes was induced by a method based on the method of Summers and Gibbons (28Summers K.E. Gibbons I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Protease (trypsin, elastase, or nagarse) and ATP (final concentration of 0.1 mm) were added to an axonemal suspension at room temperature. These proteases have been shown to be effective in inducing disintegration of Chlamydomonasaxonemes (46Okagaki T. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The protein ratio of protease to axonemes was varied between 1:2000 and 1:50. In some experiments, the progression of disintegration was monitored using a dark-field microscope equipped with a 100-watt mercury arc lamp and SIT camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The progress of sliding disintegration was quantified by measuring the number of apparently intact axonemesversus those that underwent disintegration. Because the axonemes were not first fragmented, the outer doublet microtubules remained held together at the base even after disintegration took place. This condition facilitated the measurement of the numbers of disintegrated axonemes. In other experiments, the progression of disintegration was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the turbidity of the samples at 350 nm after addition of ATP and protease. For protein analysis of the disintegrating axonemes, aliquots of samples were transferred at regular intervals to SDS-PAGE sample buffer and immediately boiled for 3 min. This procedure was modified from that of Kinter and Sherman (47Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Wiley-Interscience, New York2000: 153-157Google Scholar) and conducted at room temperature except when stated otherwise. The relevant protein band was cut from the gel and cut into pieces of ∼1 mm3. Gel pieces were extracted with 200 μl of 50% methanol and 5% acetic acid overnight and again for 3 h. A 5-min incubation with 200 μl of acetonitrile was carried out to dehydrate the gel pieces. The acetonitrile was discarded, and dehydration was completed by centrifugation under vacuum for 3 min. Gel pieces were rehydrated by incubation for 30 min in 30 μl of 10 mm DTT in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The DTT solution was discarded, and 30 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added with incubation for 30 min. The iodoacetamide solution was discarded, and the gel pieces were dehydrated with acetonitrile as described above. After discarding the acetonitrile, the gel pieces were rehydrated with 200 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 10 min. The ammonium bicarbonate was discarded, and the gel pieces were dehydrated with acetonitrile as described above. After discarding the acetonitrile, dehydration of the gel pieces was completed by centrifugation under vacuum for 3 min. 30 μl of trypsin reagent (20 μg/ml of ice-cold 50 mmammonium bicarbonate) was added to the sample, and the gel pieces were allowed to rehydrate on ice for 10 min with occasional vortexing. The gel pieces were centrifuged for 30 s, and excess trypsin solution was removed. 5 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to the sample, and the sample was vortexed. Digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C. 30 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to the digest, and the sample was extracted for 10 min with occasional gentle vortexing. The gel pieces were centrifuged for 30 s, and the peptide-containing supernatant was transferred to a plastic microcentrifuge tube. This extraction was repeated two more times, and the supernatants were combined. The volume of the extract was reduced to <20 μl in a vacuum centrifuge. 1 μl of peptide extract was manually injected onto a ThermoHypersil BetaBasic18 C18 microbore column (50 × 0.18 mm, 150-Å pore size) running at 2 μl/min. A linear gradient from 100% solution A (95% acetonitrile/water with 1% formic acid) to 40% solution B (5% acetonitrile/water with 1% formic acid) was run for 40 min with direct nanoelectrospray into a Finnigan LCQ ion trap. Data-dependent tandem mass spectra were acquired by automatic switching between mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry mode by the instrument (described in the instrument documentation) and were searched using Sequest software (48Eng J. McCormack A. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5314) Google Scholar) against the latest version of the expressed sequence tag data bases filtered for Chlamydomonas. Clones AV396026 and AV626093 were sequenced by the DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility of Iowa State University (Ames, IA). Sequence assembly and analysis were performed using the Wisconsin Package Version 10.2 of Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI). Molecular mass and pI predictions were performed using the Compute pI/MW Program of ExPaSy. 2Available at www.us.expasy.org. Pattern and profile searches were performed using ScanProsite, ExPaSy, and BLAST through the NCBI Protein Database. 3Available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. For determination of a partial sequence of the 72-kDa protease-sensitive axonemal protein, axonemes obtained from a 5-liter culture of pf14 were extracted with high ionic strength solution, followed by dialysis against low ionic strength solution. The extracted axonemes were concentrated by centrifugation and separated by SDS-PAGE. The relevant band was excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the method of Rosenfeld et al. (50Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by addition of 10% trifluoroacetic acid. The polypeptides were eluted from the gel by soaking twice with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile for 40 min at room temperature and fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography on an RPC C2C18 column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Fractions of four discrete peaks were collected and subjected to sequencing on an ABI 494 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the National Institute for Basic Biology Center for Analytical Instruments (Okazaki, Japan). Two sets of degenerate primers were designed from two peptide sequences (EQGGPLPYPGDPVDVYR and TFEPLEADEYTLTYMENYK) and used to PCR-amplify fragments of genomic DNA. A cDNA library (a gift from Dr. P. A. Lefebvre, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN) was screened with the genomic fragments. Clones that hybridized with both probes were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA sequence was completed using 5′- and 3′-RACE (5′-RACE system, Invitrogen). To obtain a clone covering the entire coding region, reverse transcription-PCR was carried out on total RNA using primers designed from the end sequences determined by RACE (Superscript II reverse transcriptase, Invitrogen). Total RNA was prepared from wild-type vegetative cells by the TRIzol regent method (Invitrogen) every 10 min after deflagellation induced by pH shock (43Witman G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The RNA samples were separated on a formaldehyde-containing 1.5% agarose gel (51Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and transferred to a Biodyne B membrane (Nihon Pall, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). An ∼500-bp RIB72 cDNA fragment was labeled with 32P and used as a probe. Hybridization was performed according to standard methods (51Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RSP14(formerly CRY-1), a clone coding for the S14 ribosomal protein that is not involved in flagellar assembly (52Nelson J.A. Savereide P.B. Lefebvre P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), was used as a loading control in certain experiments. The coding region of the cDNA was amplified by PCR with primers BE1 (CATGCCATGGCTGGCGGGGCGCCTCCG) and BE2 (CGCGGATCCGAGCCCCAGCAGGCCCAG), which contain the recognition sites (underlined) for NcoI andBamHI, respectively. The PCR product was ligated into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the bacterial expression vector pQE60 (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), resulting in a fusion protein containing a His tag sequence at its C terminus. The expression of the fusion protein was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a logarithmically growing culture of Escherichia coli to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The cells were suspended in Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate and 0.6 m NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme, incubated on ice for 30 min, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 400,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences). After the column was washed with Buffer A containing 75 mm imidazole, the recombinant protein was eluted with Buffer A containing 0.5m imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 500 volumes of HMDEK solution containing 0.6 m KCl for 3 h at 4 °C. The dialysis solution was then exchanged three times with HMDEK solution, each time with a lower KCl concentration (0.3, 0.1, and 0 m). Bacterially expressed Rib72 was used as the antigen for production of anti-Rib72 antibody. Recombinant protein was dialyzed against PBS and emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant (Naralai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Two rabbits were immunized hypodermically twice with a 3-week interval. Serum was obtained 1 week after the second injection. Antibody was blot-purified (53Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Rib72 from pf14axonemes. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with a 7 or 7.5% acrylamide gel or 5–20% acrylamide gradient gels by the method of Laemmli (54Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Serva Blue R or silver (55Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). For quantitation, gels were loaded with protein and stained with Serva Blue in the linear region of protein-dye binding, scanned on a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad), and analyzed by Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot procedures were modified from those of Towbin et al. (56Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). In the first method, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), incubated with blocking buffer (0.05% Tween 20 and 3% skimmed milk in PBS, pH 7.4), and probed with primary antibodies diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer. Immunoreactive bands were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cappel Research Products, Durham, NC) and a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). In the second method, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, and 10% methanol at 24 mA for 30 min using a Genie Blotter (Idea Scientific, Minneapolis, MN). Transferred proteins were stained with 0.02% Ponceau S (Sigma) in 3% trichloroacetic acid. Blots were blocked with SuperBlock® (Pierce) in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were diluted 1:10 in SuperBlock, washed with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, and detected using SuperSignal® WestPico® chemilum"

The transcription factors driving MYCN expression in neuroblastomas are unknown. In transient-transfection assays, E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 activate aMYCN reporter construct dependent on the presence of several putative E2F-binding sites. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 bind to the proximal MYCN promoter in vivo, specifically in neuroblastoma cell lines expressing MYCN. Inhibition of E2F activity in MYCN-amplified cells by the overexpression of p16INK4A reduced MYCN expression. In addition, we provide evidence that E2F proteins are involved in the negative regulation of MYCN by TGF-β and retinoic acid. These data suggest that E2F transcription factors are critical for both the full activation and the repression of MYCN in neuroblastomas.

Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Google Scholar). Overexpression of the MYC genes as a result of chromosomal translocation, gene amplification, or loss of negative transcriptional control plays a prominent role in the etiology of many types of tumors. The evidence for a contribution of the MYCgenes to tumorigenesis and the functional consequences ofMYC overexpression have been the focus of several recent reviews (2Lutz W. Leon J. Eilers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 61-71Google Scholar, 3Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2023-2030Google Scholar). Support for a critical role of MYC in cancer comes from several transgenic mouse models of MYC-induced tumorigenesis in which MYC expression can be reversibly switched off after tumors have developed (4Pelengaris S. Littlewood T. Khan M. Elia G. Evan G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 565-577Google Scholar, 5Felsher D.W. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 199-207Google Scholar, 6D'Cruz C.M. Gunther E.J. Boxer R.B. Hartman J.L.

Switching offMYC expression in the tumors resulted in tumor regression, suggesting that a tumor cell requires continuous MYCexpression, although secondary genetic changes can obliterate thisMYC dependence. The MYCN gene is found amplified in several types of childhood tumors of mostly neuroendocrine origin, including about 25% of neuroblastomas (7Savelyeva L. Schwab M. Cancer Lett. 2001; 167: 115-123Google Scholar). Amplification results in overexpression ofMYCN and distinguishes a subset of aggressive tumors with a poor prognosis (8Brodeur G.M. Seeger R.C. Schwab M. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Science. 1984; 224: 1121-1124Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that blockingMYCN expression may be beneficial for neuroblastoma patients. However, the development of a therapy based on this concept is hampered by our lack of understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the MYCN gene in neuroblastomas (9Strieder V. Lutz W. Cancer Lett. 2002; 180: 107-119Google Scholar). Several signals that trigger neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, including pharmacological concentrations of all-transretinoic acid, cause a repression of MYCN (10Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P. Israel M.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 404-406Google Scholar). This down-regulation of MYCN expression is essential for differentiation because ectopic expression of MYCN blocks differentiation (11Peverali F.A. Orioli D. Tonon L. Ciana P. Bunone G. Negri M. Della-Valle G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 457-462Google Scholar). Neither the transcription factors nor the regulatory elements mediating the response to these signals have been identified as yet. The E2F transcription factors are important regulators of cell-cycle progression, and their activity is negatively controlled by the pRb pathway, which is deregulated in the majority of human cancers (for review, see Refs. 12Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E65-E67Google Scholar and 13Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Google Scholar). Recent DNA microarray analyses have identified a large number of genes that are regulated by one or more of the E2F proteins (14Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F.

The products of these target genes regulate diverse cellular processes including cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, differentiation, and DNA repair. There are six E2F family members that can be classified into different subgroups based on their structure, affinity for different members of the pRb family, and putative function. Members of one of these subgroups, which consists of E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3, associate predominantly with pRb and, when overexpressed in serum-starved immortalized cells, are sufficient to induce progression into S-phase. E2F-4 and E2F-5, which form a second subgroup, bind to all pRb family proteins and are impaired in their ability to induce S-phase in quiescent cells. Whereas members of the first subgroup function predominantly in transcriptional activation, members of the second subgroup have been implicated in transcriptional repression. Although neither mutations in the RB gene nor any of the other genetic alterations known to inactivate the pRb pathway in different types of tumors have been detected in neuroblastomas, recent evidence suggests that E2F activity in neuroblastomas may nevertheless be deregulated (20Takita J. Hayashi Y. Nakajima T. Adachi J. Tanaka T. Yamaguchi N. Ogawa Y. Hanada R. Yamamoto K. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3137-3143Google Scholar, 21Lasorella A. Noseda M. Beyna M. Yokota Y. Iavarone A. Nature. 2000; 407: 592-598Google Scholar). A region of 200 bp immediately upstream of the multiple transcription start sites is highly conserved in the MYCN genes of man and mouse and controls basal promoter activity (22Hiller S. Breit S. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 969-977Google Scholar). DMS1 in vivo-footprinting of this region revealed several sites that were either hypersensitive or protected from modification by DMS in neuroblastoma cells expressing MYCN but were absent in cells that do not express MYCN (23Lutz W. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 303-315Google Scholar). One of the protected regions corresponded to two inversely oriented and overlapping E2F binding sites, indicating that members of the E2F family of transcription factors regulate MYCN expression in neuroblastomas. We therefore tested whether the MYCN gene is indeed regulated by E2F proteins in neuroblastomas. We show that the transcription factors E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 bind the MYCNpromoter in human neuroblastoma cells in vivo, and that blocking E2F acitivity in neuroblastoma cells via overexpression of p16INK4A reduces MYCN mRNA levels in a neuroblastoma cell line with amplification of MYCN. In addition, we show that TGF-β represses the MYCN gene through the E2F-binding sites, and that all-trans retinoic acid induced down-regulation of MYCN is associated with changes in E2F binding to the MYCN promoter. The human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-EP, IMR-32, LA-N-5, and Kelly were a gift of Manfred Schwab and were cultured as described (23Lutz W. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 303-315Google Scholar). HaCaT were kindly provided by Norbert Fusenig and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Drugs and growth factors were added to the cell culture medium at the following concentrations: all-trans retinoic acid, 50 μm; TGF-β (R&D Systems), 2.5 ng/ml. Cells were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum using calcium phosphate precipitation in BBS buffer (50 mmBES, pH 6.95, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4). For transient reporter assays, cells in 6-cm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of DNA (4 μg of reporter construct, 0.5 μg of CMV enhancer/promoter-based expression vectors for both DP1 and E2F, 2 μg of an eGFP expression vector, and 3 μg of Bluescript). Cells were lysed in 100 mm potassium phosphate/0.2% Triton X-100, followed by three freeze/thaw cycles. Reporter assays were performed according to standard procedures. Luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of a co-transfected lacZ reporter construct for the assays in HaCaT cells, or to total protein of the lysates as determined by Bradford assay for the experiments involving overexpression of E2F proteins. In these cases, the percentage of cells expressing eGFP was determined microscopically before harvesting the cells to exclude differences in the relative transfection efficiencies. No significant differences in the number of eGFP-positive cells were observed between different samples. The luciferase reporter constructs have been described (23Lutz W. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 303-315Google Scholar). The following CMV-based E2F expression vectors were used: pCMV-E2F-1 (24Lukas J. Petersen B.O. Holm K. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1047-1057Google Scholar); pCMV-E2F-2 (25Lees J.A. Saito M. Vidal M. Valentine M. Look T. Harlow E. Dyson N. Helin K. Mol. Cell.

Human IMR-32 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the ecotropic receptor, and G418-resistant cells were pooled for infection with ecotropic retroviruses based on pBabehygro-p16. Recombinant retroviruses were generated and used as described (30Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hanel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Google Scholar). Infected cells were selected with 100 μg/ml hygromycin and analyzed immediately without further passaging. The p16 construct was obtained by inserting the p16 cDNA derived from pXp16ink4 into pBabehygro (31Schulze A. Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Henglein B. Jansen-Durr P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3475-3482Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis, transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and Western blotting were performed according to standard procedures using 50 μg of the whole-cell lysates prepared for reporter assays. Cdk2 was used to control for equal loading. The antibodies used were: α-HA, clone 16B12 (MMS-101P, BABCO); α-E2F1, C-20 (sc-193, Santa Cruz); α-E2F-2, C-20 (sc-633, Santa Cruz); α-Cdk2, M2 (sc-163, Santa Cruz). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed according to published procedures with some modifications. Cross-linking of the cells as well as preparation and sonication of chromatin were carried out as described by Boyd (32Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and reversal of cross-links was done according to Takahashi (33Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, twelve 15-cm dishes of subconfluent cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm Pipes pH 8, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cells were then ruptured in a Dounce homogenizer, and nuclei were pelleted, washed once in lysis buffer, and resuspended in sonication buffer (10 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). After 10 min, on ice the solution was sonicated with a Bandelin Sonoplus carrying a MS73 tip at 30% maximum power for six to ten 10-s pulses on ice. The chromatin solution was cleared for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. After thawing, the solution was microcentrifuged as before and then pre-cleared by the addition of a mixture of protein A and protein G-Sepharose (previously blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA in sonication buffer at 4 °C overnight) for 4 h. Aliquots of the pre-cleared chromatin were incubated with 2 μg of each antibody overnight at 4 °C. One aliquot was incubated without antibody. The supernatant of this sample was later processed in parallel with the immunoprecipitates starting with the RNase A and proteinase K digest (this sample is referred to as “Input”). Immune complexes were captured with 40 μl of blocked protein A/protein G-Sepharose, washed seven times with cold washing buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.7% deoxycholate and protease inhibitors) and once with TE, and then resuspended in 200 μl of TE. Both the immunoprecipitates and the input sample were digested with 10 μg each of RNase A and proteinase K at 55 °C for 3 h. After incubation at 65 °C overnight, the Sepharose was pelleted, and the supernatant containing the co-precipitated DNA was applied to a PCR purification column (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The purified DNA was eluted in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris. 1 μl of the eluted DNA was used for PCR. The following antibodies were used: anti-Gadd-45 (sc-H165; Santa Cruz), anti-acetylated H3 and H4 (06–599 and 06–866; Upstate Biotechnologies); the antibodies specific for E2F family members and pocket proteins have been used for chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments before (33Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref Google Scholar). The following primers were used:MYCN: 5′-AATGACAAGCAATTGCCAGGC-3′ and 5′-AGGCGCCAAGGCTTTCGCG-3′; GAP-43: 5′-GGGGCTGGGGGAAGTGATTAGTC-3′ and 5′-CCCCCTCTCCACCTCTTTTCTGC-3′;p107 (33Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref Google Scholar); α-prothymosin (34Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Google Scholar). Thep107 and α-prothymosin PCRs were run for 36 cycles and the GAP-43 PCR for 38 cycles. In the case of theMYCN primers, the PCR was run for 30 cycles with DNA from Kelly and IMR-32, and for 36 cycles for DNA from SH-EP, to compensate for the amplification of the MYCN locus in Kelly and IMR-32. The PCRs for the chromatin immunoprecipitation with pocket protein-specific antibodies were performed on an ABI 7000 using SYBR Green. First, the mean cycle threshold (Ct) values of triplicate reactions of the input samples were analyzed. Chromatin preparations were only used when the input samples showed a Ct difference of 0.5 or less. Then, the Ct values of PCR reactions using the immunoprecipitated chromatin as a template were subtracted from the Ct values of the PCR reactions with the negative control sample (immunoprecipitation of chromatin in the absence of antibody; when the Ct values of the α-Gadd-45 samples were used as negative-control samples, very similar results were obtained). The mean values of these ΔCt values of triplicate PCR reactions were than compared between untreated and retinoic acid-treated samples. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and 1 μg was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II and random primers. An aliquot of cDNA first strands corresponding to 50 ng of RNA was used for the PCR amplification. Pilot experiments established that the PCR conditions used are within the linear range of amplification. Selective results were confirmed with real-time PCR on an ABI 7000 using SYBR Green. Primer sequences are available upon request. To test whether transcription factors of the E2F-family are able to activate the MYCN promoter in neuroblastoma cells, we transiently co-transfected human neuroblastoma cells with E2F expression vectors and a reporter construct in which luciferase expression is controlled by 230 base pairs of the humanMYCN gene, which encompass the major transcription start sites and three closely spaced putative E2F-binding sites, two of which overlap (Fig. 1 A). In SH-EP cells lacking amplification and expression of MYCN, this reporter construct was activated 3- to 5-fold by E2F-1, 2- to 3-fold by E2F-2, and 8- to 10-fold by E2F-3 (Fig. 1 A). E2F-4 and E2F-5 did not influence the activity of the MYCN promoter in this assay. Similar results were obtained with two neuroblastoma cell lines with amplified MYCN, IMR-32, and Kelly (data not shown). Western blotting showed high levels of E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, and E2F-4 in the transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). E2F-5 was expressed at about 20% of E2F-3 and E2F-4, respectively. A point-mutant reporter construct lacking the two overlapping E2F-sites was not activated by E2F-1 but was still responsive to E2F-3 (Fig. 1 C). A construct lacking all three E2F-sites was only weakly activated by E2F-3 compared with the wild-type construct. Therefore, the proximal promoter of the MYCN gene in neuroblastoma cells is activated by E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3, but not E2F-4 and E2F-5, and this activation is largely dependent on intact E2F-binding sites. If E2F proteins do play a role in the maintenance of MYCNexpression in neuroblastoma, they should bind to the MYCNpromoter in MYCN-expressing neuroblastoma cells. To test this prediction, ChIP assays with antibodies specific for E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, and E2F-4 were performed with cross-linked chromatin from three neuroblastoma cell lines. Co-precipitated chromatin was used as template for PCR amplification using primers that amplify a 190-base pair fragment of the proximal MYCN promoter, including all three E2F binding sites. In the two cell lines Kelly and IMR-32, which show amplification and overexpression of MYCN, E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 but not E2F-4 bound to the proximal MYCN promoter (Fig. 2). In contrast, in SH-EP cells lacking detectable MYCN expression, no association of any of the E2F proteins with the MYCN promoter could be detected. Binding of E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 to the promoter of another E2F-responsive gene, p107 (RBL1), was readily detected in all three cell lines including SH-EP. No product for any of the imunoprecipitated chromatin samples was obtained with primers amplifying part of intron 1 of the PTMA gene encoding α-prothymosin, which harbors a MYC-responsive E-box motif but no E2F-binding site. There were marked differences in the abundance of different E2F proteins at the MYCN promoter in Kellyversus IMR-32 cells, with E2F-1 being the predominant E2F-binding activity in Kelly, whereas E2F-1–E2F-3 were present in equal amounts in IMR-32. From these data, we conclude that members of the E2F family bind the proximal MYCN promoter in vivo specifically in neuroblastoma cells with strongMYCN expression. Having demonstrated binding of E2F proteins to theMYCN promoter in vivo, we next asked whether blocking E2F activity would cause a reduction of endogenousMYCN expression. Overexpression of p16INK4a, an inhibitor of Cdk4 and Cdk6, leads to the accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRb and G1 arrest (35Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Google Scholar). IMR-32 cells do not produce detectable amounts of p16INK4a protein (20Takita J. Hayashi Y. Nakajima T. Adachi J. Tanaka T. Yamaguchi N. Ogawa Y. Hanada R. Yamamoto K. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3137-3143Google Scholar). We generated pools of IMR-32 cells expressing the ecotropic receptor and subsequently infected these cells with pBABEhygro-p16INK4A, an ecotropic retrovirus driving expression of p16INK4a, or an empty control virus. RNA was isolated from hygromycin-selected cell populations and used for RT-PCR analysis. Cells that had been infected with thep16INK4A-containing retrovirus strongly expressed p16INK4A compared with cells that had been infected with the control virus (Fig. 3). p16INK4A caused a down-regulation of both CCNE1 and MYCN (Fig. 3). These results were confirmed by real-time PCR (data not shown). We conclude that E2F activity is required for maximum expression ofMYCN in neuroblastomas. Retinoic acid (RA) triggers neuronal differentiation of some neuroblastoma cell lines including LA-N-5, which carry amplified MYCN. Morphological differentiation, which is completed after about 10 days of treatment, is preceded by a reduction of MYCN expression as early as 6 h after addition of RA (10Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P. Israel M.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 404-406Google Scholar). During the differentiation process, the amount of E2F-1 protein remains constant and the amount of E2F-4 increases sharply (36Raschella G. Tanno B. Bonetto F. Amendola R. Battista T., De Luca A. Giordano A. Paggi M.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 297-303Google Scholar). The repression of MYCN through RA has been mapped to the proximal promoter, which, however, lacks a sequence resembling a retinoic acid response element (37Wada R.K. Seeger R.C. Reynolds C.P. Alloggiamento T. Yamashiro J.M. Ruland C. Black A.C. Rosenblatt J.D. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 711-717Google Scholar). To test whether the E2F-binding sites contribute to the RA-mediated down-regulation ofMYCN, LA-N-5 cells were treated with RA or the solvent control ethanol for 12 days and subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation with a panel of E2F-specific antibodies. At this time, most of the cells had extended long cellular processes indicative of neuronal differentiation, and MYCN mRNA levels were reduced (data not shown). ChIP assay showed that in untreated LA-N-5 cells, like in Kelly and IMR-32, E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3, were associated with the MYCN promoter (Fig. 4 A). In contrast to Kelly and IMR-32 cells, E2F-3 was the predominant E2F species in LA-N-5 (compare Figs. 2 and 4 A). Furthermore, unlike Kelly and IMR-32, E2F-4 was detected at the MYCN promoter in untreated LA-N-5 cells. In differentiated cells, there was virtually no binding of E2F-2 and E2F-4 to the MYCN promoter, and the binding of E2F-3 was drastically reduced. In contrast, the binding of E2F-1 to theMYCN promoter was unaltered. The loss of binding of E2F-2, E2F-3, and E2F-4 to the MYCN promoter was accompanied by a reduction in the acetylation of histones H3 and H4, consistent with a drop in transcriptional activity of the MYCN gene (Fig. 4 A). To exclude the possibility that the chromatin from the RA-treated cells in general produced less signal despite a similar intensity of the input lanes, the proximal promoter of theGAP-43 gene, which is up-regulated during neuronal differentiation, was also analyzed. Acetylation of the histones H3 and H4 at the GAP-43 promoter was unchanged upon RA treatment. As expected, no binding of any of the E2F proteins was detected. E2F proteins can repress target genes by associating with pocket proteins and recruiting a variety of co-repressor complexes (38Ferreira R. Naguibneva I. Pritchard L.L. Ait-Si-Ali S. Harel-Bellan A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3128-3133Google Scholar). To test whether pocket proteins are bound to the MYCN promoter in undifferentiated or differentiated LA-N-5 cells and to exclude the possibility that masking of the antibody epitopes on the E2F proteins by associated pocket proteins in RA-treated cells prevented their detection in the ChIP assay, we performed another chromatin immunoprecipitation with a panel of pocket-protein-specific antibodies, which have previously been shown to detect repressive E2F complexes in ChIP assays (33Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref Google Scholar). We detected low levels of pRb, p107, and p130 at theMYCN promoter in undifferentiated cells (Fig. 4 B). In differentiated cells there were no changes in binding of p107 and p130; in contrast, binding of pRb increased upon differentiation. Thus, down-regulation of MYCN transcription in the course of RA-triggered differentiation of neuroblastoma cells is accompanied by a loss of binding of E2F-2, E2F-3, and E2F-4, a reduction in histone acetylation, and recruitment of pRb. TGF-β has been shown to down-regulate MYCNexpression (39Serra R. Moses H.L. Development. 1995; 121: 3057-3066Google Scholar). E2F-binding sites can confer TGF-β responsiveness to a promoter (40Zhang H.S. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 53-61Google Scholar). In addition to several E2F-binding sites, theMYCN promoter also contains a putative TGF-β-inhibitory element (TIE; consensus sequence: GnnTTGGnG) (41Kerr L.D. Miller D.B. Matrisian L.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 267-278Google Scholar) that partly overlaps the third E2F-binding site (Fig. 5 A). To determine whether either the E2F-binding sites or the TIE are required for the regulation of MYCN by TGF-β, HaCaT human keratinocytes were transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant MYCNpromoter-dependent luciferase constructs and then either treated with TGF-β for 26 h or left untreated. The wild-typeMYCN promoter was repressed 5-fold by TGF-β in HaCaT cells (Fig. 5 B). A promoter lacking the two overlapping E2F-binding sites showed a reduction in basal activity compared with the wild-type construct, and this residual activity was not reduced further by TGF-β. In contrast, a promoter with a mutation destroying both the TIE and the third E2F-binding site was almost as active as the wild-type promoter and was repressed by TGF-β to the same extent as the wild-type promoter. Thus, in HaCaT cells, the two overlapping E2F-binding sites of the MYCN promoter mediate the major part of the promoter activity as well as its responsiveness to TGF-β, whereas neither the putative TIE nor the third E2F-binding site contribute to promoter activity or TGF-β responsiveness. We have shown here that E2F proteins regulate MYCNtranscription and are required for full activity of the MYCNpromoter in neuroblastomas. This conclusion is based on the following observations: first, the activating members of the E2F family, E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3, activate the MYCN promoter in transient transfections in an E2F-site-dependent manner; second, E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 bind to the MYCN promoter in vivo specifically in neuroblastoma cells exhibitingMYCN expression; third, inhibition of E2F activity through overexpression of p16INK4A reduces MYCN mRNA levels; fourth, several signals known to down-regulate MYCNexpression either require intact E2F-binding sites for their regulation of the MYCN gene or are associated with changes in the binding of E2F proteins to the MYCN promoter. These data support the existence of a positive feedback loop linking E2F and N-Myc, which may at least in part explain the maintenance ofMYCN expression in aggressive neuroblastomas (for discussion, see Ref. 9Strieder V. Lutz W. Cancer Lett. 2002; 180: 107-119Google Scholar). The status of the pRb pathway in neuroblastomas and its role in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis is far from clear. Mutations inRB itself or other genes implicated in the pathway are rare in neuroblastomas. There is, however, evidence that the pRb pathway may become inactivated in neuroblastomas by other means. One is the inactivation of CDKN2A (p16ink4A) by promoter methylation in some neuroblastomas (20Takita J. Hayashi Y. Nakajima T. Adachi J. Tanaka T. Yamaguchi N. Ogawa Y. Hanada R. Yamamoto K. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3137-3143Google Scholar). However, other neuroblastomas contain large amounts of p16INK4A (42Easton J. Wei T. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2624-2632Google Scholar, 43Diccianni M.B. Omura-Minamisawa M. Batova A., Le, T. Bridgeman L. Yu A.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 145-154Google Scholar). This observation may be explained by the overexpression in neuroblastomas of Id2, which has been suggested to sequester and inactivate pRb and thus bypass p16INK4A (21Lasorella A. Noseda M. Beyna M. Yokota Y. Iavarone A. Nature. 2000; 407: 592-598Google Scholar). IMR-32 is one of the cell lines that, because of the direct transcriptional activation of ID2 by N-Myc, produce large amounts of Id2 (21Lasorella A. Noseda M. Beyna M. Yokota Y. Iavarone A. Nature. 2000; 407: 592-598Google Scholar). However, IMR-32 also lacks detectable p16INK4Aprotein (20Takita J. Hayashi Y. Nakajima T. Adachi J. Tanaka T. Yamaguchi N. Ogawa Y. Hanada R. Yamamoto K. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3137-3143Google Scholar). If overexpression of Id2 were indeed a way of blocking pRb function in neuroblastomas, one would expect that overexpression of p16INK4A, which controls pRb upstream of Id2, would not be able to reestablish negative control over E2F activity. In U2OS osteosarcoma cells, Id2 can indeed reverse the cell-cycle arrest induced by p16INK4A (44Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2570-2578Google Scholar). We tested whether this is also true for neuroblastoma cells by introducing p16INK4A into IMR-32 by retroviral infection and found that p16INK4A repressed both CCNE1 andMYCN, suggesting that overexpressed Id2 is not able to relieve negative control of E2F activity in neuroblastoma cells. This is consistent with the observation that the majority of primary neuroblastomas do not express detectable amounts of p16INK4A protein and that the lack of p16INK4Ain primary neuroblastomas is associated with a poor prognosis (20Takita J. Hayashi Y. Nakajima T. Adachi J. Tanaka T. Yamaguchi N. Ogawa Y. Hanada R. Yamamoto K. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3137-3143Google Scholar). The MYC promoter is the target of multiple mitogenic and antimitogenic signals, some of which regulate MYC expression via an E2F site in the MYC promoter (45Johansen L.M. Iwama A. Lodie T.A. Sasaki K. Felsher D.W. Golub T.R. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3789-3806Google Scholar, 46Wong K.K. Zou X. Merrell K.T. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Chellappan S. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6535-6544Google Scholar). Our results provide evidence that the E2F-binding sites in the MYCNpromoter are also involved in the response to different signals. The conservation of E2F-binding sites in the proximal promoter regions of both MYC and MYCN and the shared role of these E2F-binding sites in repressing promoter activity in response to external signals points to similarities in the regulatory logic of the two genes despite their very different spatiotemporal expression profiles. We hypothesize that after duplication of the ancientMYC gene into MYC and MYCN, the preservation in both genes of the regulatory elements required for tight negative control was essential, given their oncogenic potential. If true, the E2F-binding sites in the MYC genes could be regarded as central negative control elements to restrictMYC/MYCN expression in a dominant fashion. Down-regulation of MYCN by TGF-β may be mediated by E2F-4-containing repressor complexes, which have been shown to form at E2F target promoters in response to TGF-β in keratinocytes (47Iavarone A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 916-922Google Scholar). Yet, the finding that TGF-β represses MYCN via the E2F binding sites is unexpected in light of several previous reports mapping the repressive effect of TGF-β on the MYC promoter to a TGF-β inhibitory element (TIE), because a putative TIE is also present in the MYCN promoter (48Chen C.R. Kang Y. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 992-999Google Scholar, 49Yagi K. Furuhashi M. Aoki H. Goto D. Kuwano H. Sugamura K. Miyazono K. Kato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 854-861Google Scholar). Very recently, the TIE in the MYC promoter was redefined as a noncanonical Smad-binding site, 5′-GGCT-3′, adjacent to the E2F-binding site (50Chen C.R. Kang Y. Siegel P.M. Massague J. Cell. 2002; 110: 19-32Google Scholar). It was shown that both the E2F and Smad-binding sites are required for repression of MYC transcription by TGF-β and that they form a composite regulatory element that binds a repressor complex containing Smad3, Smad4, E2F-4/5, DP1, and p107. Notably, the overlapping E2F sites in the MYCN promoter are flanked by putative Smad-binding sites. Recently, advanced-stage primary neuroblastomas were reported to express strongly reduced levels of the TGF-β type III receptor (51Iolascon A. Giordani L. Borriello A. Carbone R. Izzo A. Tonini G.P. Gambini C. Della Ragione F. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 1171-1176Google Scholar). In addition, whereas ganglioneuroblastomas, which show a more differentiated phenotype than neuroblastomas, express TGF-β, a majority of primary neuroblastomas do not (52McCune B.K. Patterson K. Chandra R.S. Kapur S. Sporn M.B. Tsokos M. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 49-58Google Scholar). Together, these observations indicate that neuroblastomas may escape negative growth control by TGF-β. E2F-binding sites, for example in the cdc25A gene, have previously been implicated in mediating regulation by TGF-β (47Iavarone A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 916-922Google Scholar, 53Bouzahzah B., Fu, M. Iavarone A. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Pestell R.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4531-4537Google Scholar). Neither this site nor the E2F-binding sites in other E2F target genes such as B-myb and E2F1 contribute to the activity of the promoter in the context of transient assays in HaCaT cells, indicating that these E2F-binding sites function exclusively in transcriptional repression (54Li J.M., Hu, P.P. Shen X., Yu, Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4948-4953Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, the E2F-binding sites of the MYCN promoter are important for promoter activation, accounting for roughly 80% of the promoter activity in HaCaT cells in the absence of TGF-β. TGF-β blocks only the E2F site-dependent activity but not the residual E2F site-independent activity of the promoter. In contrast to the down-regulation by TGF-β, the negative regulation of MYCN by retinoic acid cannot involve an E2F-4/p107 complex because we observed a reduction rather than an increase of binding of E2F-4 to the MYCN promoter during differentiation. The reduction in binding of E2F-4 to theMYCN promoter could simply be a result of reduced protein levels in the course of differentiation. However, the amount of E2F-4 in LA-N-5 cells has previously been shown to increase during RA-induced differentiation (36Raschella G. Tanno B. Bonetto F. Amendola R. Battista T., De Luca A. Giordano A. Paggi M.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 297-303Google Scholar). The observation that E2F-1, unlike E2F-2 and E2F3, remained associated with the MYCN promoter during differentiation together with the increased binding of pRb suggests that in the course of differentiation an E2F-1/Rb complex rather than an E2F4/p107 complex contributes to the repression of theMYCN gene. This would indicate that in response to different signals, distinct E2F/pocket protein complexes mediate down-regulation of MYCN. The ChIP results show differences in the relative binding of different E2F proteins to the MYCN promoter in various neuroblastoma cell lines, with E2F-1 being predominant in Kelly cells, whereas E2F-3 predominated in LA-N-5. Because MYCN is strongly expressed in all of these cell lines, E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 appear to be redundant with regard to the activation of the MYCNpromoter. We have no explanation for the association of E2F-4 with theMYCN promoter in undifferentiated, MYCN amplified LA-N-5 cells. The results with the other MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines Kelly and IMR-32, however, show that E2F-4, although it can be found associated with the MYCN promoter, is not required for the expression of MYCN in these cells. In summary, we have identified E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 as the first transcription factors known to regulate MYCN expression in neuroblastomas. An understanding of the events that accompany activation and repression of the MYCN gene at these E2F-binding sites may eventually suggest means of blocking expression of MYCN in the tumor cells.

In the present study, an essential 14-amino acid (aa 335–348) sorting signal was defined on the cytoplasmic tail of Asbt with two potential phosphorylation sites motifs for casein kinase II (335SFQE) and protein kinase C (PKC) (339TNK). Two-dimension NMR spectra analysis demonstrated that a tetramer, 340NKGF, which overlaps with the potential PKC site within the 14-mer signal sequence, adopts a type I β-turn conformation. Replacement of the potential phosphorylation residue Ser335 and Thr339 with alanine or deletion of either the 4 (335SFQE) or 10 aa (338–348, containing339TNKGF) from the C terminus of Asbt resulted in a significantly decreased initial bile acid transport activity and increased the basolateral distribution of the mutants by 2–3-fold compared with that of wild type Asbt. Deletion of the entire last 14 amino acids (335–348) from the C terminus of Asbt abolished the apical expression of the truncated Asbt. Moreover, replacement of the cytoplasmic tail of the liver basolateral membrane protein, Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, with the 14-mer peptide tail of Asbt redirected the chimera to the apical domain. In contrast, a chimera consisting of the 14-mer peptide of Asbt fused with green fluorescent protein was expressed in an intracellular transport vesicle-like distribution in transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney and COS 7 cells. This suggests that the apical localization of the 14-mer peptide requires a membrane anchor to support proper targeting. The results from biological reagent treatment and low temperature shift (20 °C) suggests that Asbt follows a transport vesicle-mediated apical sorting pathway that is brefeldin A-sensitive and insensitive to protein glycosylation, monensin treatment, and low temperature shift.

During the past decade, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of mechanisms by which bile acids enter and exit liver and intestinal cells. By contrast, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity and membrane localization of these ion transporters remain poorly understood. Recent cloning of several key genes, whose protein products are integral to the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, has provided an opportunity to investigate the cellular and molecular control of this important metabolic and physiologic pathway. The ileal apical sodium bile acid transporter (Asbt)1 plays a major role in the recovery of bile acids from the intestinal lumen (1Inoue M. Kinne R. Tran T. Arias I.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2Shneider B.L. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1995; 20: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding this transporter have been cloned from several species (3Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.-M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat Asbt contains seven potential transmembrane domains, localizes to apical surface of ileal enterocytes, and transports conjugated bile acids in a Na+-dependent fashion. Sequence analyses of Asbt revealed that there are three conserved domains in the 40-amino acid cytoplasmic tails across species. In addition, there are two potential phosphorylation sites, one for casein kinase II (CK II,335SFQE) and another for protein kinase C (PKC,339TNK), in the last 14 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of rat Asbt. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that deletion of the 40-amino acid cytoplasmic tail from the carboxyl terminus of rat Asbt results in a total loss of bile acid transport function (5Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the cytoplasmic tail of Asbt is important for protein localization and/or transport function. The mechanisms underlying the basolateral sorting of membrane proteins have been recently defined and have been associated with sorting signals in the cytoplasm tail of these proteins. A β-turn structure has been found in several proteins as part of the sorting signal for the basolateral membrane targeting (6Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Dargemont C., Le Bivic A. Rothenberger S. Iacopetta B. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the apical targeting signals are less well defined and are of diverse molecular nature. Up to now, no conformational data are available for the apical sorting signals. In the present study, we have constructed a series of truncated, mutated, and chimeric rat Asbts to analyze the targeting signals of this apical membrane transporter. A novel 14-mer apical plasma membrane sorting signal has been identified on the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of Asbt. The potential secondary structure of this apical sorting signal has been evaluated by two-dimensional NMR of a synthesized peptide. The results demonstrate that a tetrapeptide,340NGKP, which overlaps with a potential PKC phosphorylation site in this 14-mer sequence, adopts a type I β-turn structure. As far as we know, this is the first structural data for an apical targeting signal that contains an apparent β-turn conformation. In addition, we have also examined the sensitivity of the apical sorting of Asbt to drug treatment and low temperature shift. These experiments provide new information regarding the residues and mechanisms that contribute to the protein localization and the apical sorting of Asbt. Cell culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. [3H]Taurocholic acid (2.1–3.47 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled taurocholate was purchased from Sigma. Subcloning reagents, enzymes, and competent cells were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), Invitrogen, and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).

The 14-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of rat Asbt was constructed by PCR using a forward primer 5′-GCAAGCTTTCATTCCAGGAGACAAAC-, which is designed to anneal to 5′-end coding sequence (Thr1118 to Cys1135) of 14 amino acids of rat Asbt cDNA with aHindIII restriction site (boldface), and a reverse primer 5′-CCCGGATCCTTTCTCATCTGGTTGAAATC CCTTGT-TTGT1133-, containing codons that anneal to sequences 3′-end region of rat Asbt cDNA with aBemHI restriction site (underlined). These restriction sites were compatible with the polylinker of pEGFP C3 vector. The PCR products were gel-purified, digested at sites incorporated at the ends of PCR products, and ligated directly to pEGFP C3 vector digested with the same restriction enzymes to produce the GFP-fused 14-amino acid tail of rat Asbt chimera. Potential sorting determinant residues were examined by site-specific mutagenesis. The QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to convert codons for potential sorting determinant residues to alanine residues according to manufacturer's directions with minor modification as described previously (8Sun A.-Q. Arresa M.A. Zeng L. Swaby I.K. Zhou M.M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6825-6833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). (mutation at potential CK II phosphorylation residue Ser335) The rat Asbt was used as template. A S335A substitution was made using a forward primer 5′-1104TGGACCCCATGCCAGCATTCCAGGAG1129-3′, which annealed to the coding sequence in the Ser335 region, and a compatible reverse primer, in place of the codon for Ser335 was converted to alanine residue (underlined). The rat Asbt was used as template. A T339A substitution was made using a forward primer 5′-1119CATTCCAGGAGGCAAACAAGGGATTTCAACC1149-3′, which annealed to the coding sequence in the Thr339 region, and a compatible reverse primer, in place of the codon for Thr339 was converted to alanine residue (underlined). The Ser335 and Thr339 double mutant was constructed by using T339A primers and Asbt-S335A mutant construct as template. GFP-fused transporters were constructed using similar PCR-based strategies. The full-length cDNA-coding sequences of wild type or mutant transporters were used as templates. The PCR-generated mutant and wild type transporter cDNA products were subcloned into a GFP vector, pEGFPN2 (Clontech), using standard techniques. The coding sequences of wild type and mutant transporters were fused with HindIII site at N-end and BamHI site at C-end and amplified by PCR using full-length cDNA as template. These restriction sites were compatible with the pEGFP N2 polylinker. The PCR products were gel-purified, digested at sites incorporated at the ends of PCR products, and ligated directly to pEGFP N2 digested with the same restriction enzymes to produce chimeras. All plasmid constructs were checked for correct orientation by restriction digestion analysis. The positive clones containing the wild type or mutant cDNA inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. COS 7 (SV40-transformed monkey kidney fibroblast) cells were maintaining in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine). Transient DNA transfection was carried out by LipofectinTM-mediated transfection (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. MDCK II cells were maintained in complete MEM-E medium that was supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Stable DNA transfection was carried out by LipofectinTM-mediated transfection (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, 5–10 × 105 cells were plated on a 100-mm tissue culture dish. The next day, cells were ∼50% confluent and were transfected with 5 μg of DNA per 100-mm tissue culture dish. On the following day, transfected MDCK cells were split at 1:3 ratios in complete medium, and the transfected cell lines were selected by growth in the antibiotic G418 (900 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). 10–15 days after transfection, large, healthy colonies were picked by cloning cylinders and transferred to 12-well plates. The expression of the transporters was assayed initially by taurocholate influx assay and confocal microscopy (see below). All of the cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2atmosphere. The Na+-dependent taurocholate (TC) influx assay was done as described previously (8Sun A.-Q. Arresa M.A. Zeng L. Swaby I.K. Zhou M.M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6825-6833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Transwell filter system (Costar, Cambridge, MA) was used for the study of polarity of taurocholate influx. Transfected and untransfected cells were grown to confluence for 5–7 days on 0.45-μm pore size Transwell filter inserts. Formation of a tight seal between the upper and lower chambers was measured by transepithelial transport of [14C]mannitol, which was <10%, as described previously (5Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). Taurocholate uptake was performed at 37 °C for 10 min. The confluent cell monolayers grown on Transwell filters were washed twice with warm uptake buffer (116 mm NaCl (or choline), 5.3 mm KCl, 1.1 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 11 mmd-glucose, 10 mm Hepes, at pH 7.4), and each well was incubated from the apical (0.2 ml) or basolateral (0.6 ml) side with uptake buffer containing 10 μm [3H]taurocholate at the final concentrations. Following 10 min of incubation, the influx assays were terminated by aspirating the medium, and the filters were successively dipped into three beakers, each of which contained 100 ml of ice-cold uptake buffer. The filters were excised from the cups, and the attached cells were solubilized in 0.2 ml of 1% SDS and transferred into scintillation vials with 4 ml of Optifluor (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The level of protein expression of wild type and various deleted and mutated transporters in transfected cells was normalized by total protein concentrations. The protein was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. In the inhibition studies, taurocholate influx in the absence of competitor was set as 100%, and all values were graphed relative to this level. The final concentration of each inhibitor was 100 μm or indicated in figure legends. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy for Asbt was carried out as described previously (10Sun A.-Q. Swaby I.K., Xu, S.-H. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1305-G1313PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy of GFP-fused chimeras was performed on a confluent monolayer of transfected cells cultured on glass coverslips. Glass coverslip-grown cells were rinsed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 7 min in 100% methanol at −20 °C, and rinsed 4 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then mounted with Aquamount (BDH). Fluorescence were examined with a Leica TCS-SP (UV) 4-channel confocal laser scanning microscope in the Imaging Core Facility, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The 488 nm wavelength line of an argon laser and the 568 nm wavelength line of a krypton laser were used. The cell monolayer was optically sectioned every 0.5 μm. Image resolution using a Leica ×63 and/or ×100 Neofluor objective and Leica TCS-SP software was 512 × 512 pixels. All NMR spectra were acquired at 20 and 30 °C on a Bruker DRX-600 NMR spectrometer. The NMR sample of the 20-mer peptide (2.5 mm) derived from the cytoplasmic tail of rat ileal bile acid transporter was prepared in a 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm sodium chloride in 90% H2O and 10% 2H2O. The two-dimensional homonuclear TOCSY (36 ms), NOESY (300 ms), and ROESY (300 ms) spectra were acquired with 256 and 2048 complex points in ω1 and ω2, respectively (11Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 117-129Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using the NMRPipe (12Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W.

A 20-mer peptide, dmdpmpsfqetnkgfqpdek, corresponding to the sequence from Asp329 to Lys348 on the cytoplasmic tail of rat Asbt was synthesized by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The crude peptide was purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a YMC C-18 column. The peak fractions were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and analytical high pressure liquid chromatography. The effects of biological agents on delivery of these transporters to the cell surface were performed as described previously (14Alonso F.V. Compans R.W. J.

Treatment of tunicamycin that abolishes the glycosylation of viral glycoproteins was performed as described previously (8Sun A.-Q. Arresa M.A. Zeng L. Swaby I.K. Zhou M.M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6825-6833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Asbt-GFP glycosylation by tunicamycin treatment was confirmed by Western blotting. Most of the results were expressed as mean value ± S.E. and examined by Student's t test. When two or more tests were performed in an experiment, the mean is used for the group statistics. Results of different groups or categories were compared using the unpaired t test. Previous studies (5Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar) from our laboratory have demonstrated that a apical sorting motif is located on the cytoplasmic tail of Asbt and may transferable and capable of redirecting a protein normally sorted to the basolateral surface to the apical domain of MDCK cells. There are three domains (amino acids 309–318, 324–328, and 338–348) that are conserved in the 40-aa carboxyl-terminal tail of ileal transporters from the rat, hamster, mouse, and human (Fig. 1 A). To identify further the potential sorting motif in the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus, a series of sequentially shorter cytoplasmic tails of Asbt protein was generated. These truncated transporters were then transfected into COS 7 and MDCK cells. The transport activity of these mutant transporters was analyzed by a TC influx assay in a Transwell culture system. The results show that compared with wild type Asbt, deletions of 14 (aa 334–348), 25 (aa 322–348), and 40 (aa 309–348) amino acid residues in the carboxyl tail of Asbt did not change the Na+dependence of taurocholate transport function but decreased the initial rates of TC transport activity by ∼50, ∼82, and >95%, respectively, in transfected COS 7 and MDCK cells (Fig. 1 Band Fig. 2). Moreover, in stably transfected MDCK cells, deletion of the 14 and 25 amino acid residues resulted in the mutant proteins being randomly sorted to both apical and basolateral domains (Fig. 2). These results suggested that an apical sorting determinant is present within the last 14 amino acids of Asbt cytoplasmic tail.Figure 2Polarity of sodium-dependent taurocholate influx by stably transfected MDCK cells grown on Transwell filters. The rat Asbt and truncated mutants-transfected MDCK II cells were incubated in 10 μm [3H]TC (with Na+ buffer) at 37 °C for 10 min. Data are presented as cpm per Transwell insert and represent the mean values ± S.E. of two to four independent experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether the cytoplasmic tail is involved in substrate binding specificity, the effects of several bile acid analogs and organic anions on taurocholate transport activity of truncated mutants were tested. The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μm unlabeled bile acids or other organic anion competitors. Taurocholate influx in the absence of a competitor was set at 100%, and all values were measured relative to this level of activity. Fig. 3 shows that the competitive inhibitor, cholate, inhibited to a similar degree the initial rate of TC influx in COS 7 cells expressing the wild type or truncated transporters. In contrast, the noncompetitive inhibitor bromosulfophthalein (BSP) and taurodehyrocholate demonstrated various effects on the initial rate of TC influx in COS 7 cells transfected with truncated transporters or with wild type Asbt. Compared with the wild type Asbt (BSP inhibited the TC influx ∼20%), BSP had no effect or stimulated TC influx by about 20% in Del14 and Del25 transfected cells, respectively. Moreover, taurodehyrocholate had no significant effect on wild type Asbt-transfected cells but stimulated the TC influx more than 40% in the Del14-transfected cells. These results suggest that the competitive and non-competitive substrates may interact with Asbt differently, and the cytoplasmic tail of Asbt may be important for the substrate binding specificity and plasma membrane delivery in the nonpolarized COS 7 cells. There are two potential motifs for casein kinase II (CK II, 335SFQE) and protein kinase C (PKC, 339TNK) phosphorylation sites in the last 14 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of Asbt. Previous studies (17Grüne S. Engelking L.R. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17734-17741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that PKC could inhibit taurocholate influx in rat hepatocytes. In addition, a potential CK II phosphorylation site at the extreme carboxyl terminus of CMV-glycoprotein B has been reported (18Tugizov S. Maidji E. Xiao J. Zheng Z. Pereira L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7374-7386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is involved in internalization and basolateral membrane localization. In order to further identify the apical sorting signal and follow the sorting of a wild type and mutant Asbt in a cell culture model, GFP-fused wild type and a series of mutant rat Asbts were created. To examine whether the potential PKC and CK II sites are involved in the apical targeting of Asbt, we first mutated the potential phosphorylation residues Ser335 and Thr339. Three mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to replace the Ser335 (S335A-GFP), Thr339 (T339A-GFP), and both Ser335 and Thr339 (ST/AA-GFP) with alanines. Then these point mutated, and wild type Asbts were fused with the amino terminus of GFP in order to follow the intracellular localization of these proteins in transfected COS 7 and MDCK II cells. Northern and Western blotting were used to verify the cellular expression of the GFP-fused proteins (data not shown).

KIF1A particles moved anterogradely along the neurites with an average velocity of 1.0 μm/s. The movements of KIF1A were highly processive, with an average duration of persistent anterograde movement of 11 s.

The anterograde movement of KIF1A, however, did not lead to a detectable accumulation of KIF1A in the periphery of neurons, suggesting that there are mechanisms inhibiting the peripheral accumulation of KIF1A.

Targeted deletion of the KIF1A gene in mice causes a similar accumulation of clear small vesicles in the cell body of neurons as well as marked neuronal death (5Yonekawa Y. Harada A. Okada Y.

Biochemically, KIF1A associates with membrane organelles containing synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, and Rab3A (1Okada Y. Yamazaki H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Hirokawa N.

A number of important questions on KIF1A, however, remain to be addressed. Does KIF1A mediate a fast and processive transport in vivo? EGFP-tagged synaptic vesicle and plasma membrane proteins including synaptophysin often show bidirectional movements in living neurons (6Kaether C. Skehel P. Dotti C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Nakata T. Terada S. Hirokawa N. J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10324-10337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Does KIF1A also move bidirectionally? If so, what are the underlying mechanisms? What happens to KIF1A when it reaches its destination? A recent description of the movements of Unc104 in living C. elegans neurons provided direct evidence that Unc104 mediates a fast and processive neuronal transport in vivo (10Zhou H.M. Brust-Mascher I. Scholey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3749-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Along with the previous measurement of kinesin-II movement in chemosensory neurons of living C. elegans (11Orozco J.T. Wedaman K.P. Signor D. Brown H. Rose L. Scholey J.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 674Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), this is a significant progress in that C. elegans is an important model system for the study of intracellular sorting and transport (12Koushika S.P. Nonet M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, there seem to be additional complexities in mammalian homologues of Unc104. There are four known mammalian homologues of Unc104: KIF1A, KIF1B, KIF1C, and KIF1D (1Okada Y. Yamazaki H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Hirokawa N.

Information from genomic sequences indicates that the estimated number of kinesins in mammals (∼45–50) exceeds that inC. elegans (∼20–25) (20Goldstein L.S.B. Trends Cell. Biol. 2001; 11: 477-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, no direct visualization of any of the ∼50 mammalian kinesins has been made. Therefore, comparative analysis of the motor movements from living C. elegans and mammalian neurons may help us understand whether fast and processive in vivo movements of kinesins are conserved across the species. In the present study, we characterized the movement of EGFP1-tagged full-length KIF1A, a well studied mammalian KIF1 family protein with a high overall amino acid sequence identity (∼55%) to Unc104, in living cultured hippocampal neurons. Analysis of time-lapse images of the neurons expressing EGFP-tagged KIF1A revealed that KIF1A exhibits fast and processive anterograde movement with intermittent retrograde (bidirectional) movement in living cultured hippocampal neurons. To generate a mammalian expression construct containing EGFP-tagged KIF1A (KIF1A-EGFP), an XbaI site was created in GW1 KIF1A 2H. Shin and E. Kim, unpublished observations. by converting Ser-680 (TCC) and Arg-681 (AGG) of KIF1A into Ser (TCT) and Arg (AGA) by the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Subsequently, a PCR-amplified EGFP (Clontech) was subcloned in frame into GW1 KIF1A digested with XbaI. A KIF1A-EGFP mutant with a point mutation (Thr312 into Met) in the motor domain (KIF1A-EGFP-T312M) was generated using GW1 KIF1A-EGFP as a template. KIF1A-EGFP-ΔMD (aa 366–1695) was generated by inverse PCR using KIF1A-EGFP as a template. The EGFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (1167) has been described previously (21Choi J., Ko, J. Park E. Lee J.R.

Other antibodies used in the present study are as follows: microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2; Sigma), neurofilament-H (Sigma), KIF1A (1131) (a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against aa 657–937 of KIF1A 3H. Shin and E. Kim, manuscript in preparation. ) and liprin-α (1127) (a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against aa 818–1202 of liprin-α13). Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from rat embryonic brain (embryonic day 18) as described previously (22Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991Google Scholar). Briefly, dissected hippocampi were dissociated with trypsin and plated on coverslips (25 mm) coated with poly(l-lysine) (Mr30,000–70,000) in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, and 25 μm glutamate (plating medium). After 2–3 h of incubation, the plating medium was changed with a growth medium (plating medium minus glutamate). Cultured hippocampal neurons (DIV 10–12) were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (23Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence staining, cultured hippocampal neurons, after 2–3 days of transfection, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilzed in 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by incubation with EGFP (1167, 3 μg/ml), KIF1A (3 μg/ml), MAP2 (1:500), and neurofilament-H (1:500) primary antibodies. Transfected neurons on coverslips (25 mm diameter) were set on a perfusion chamber with a thermostat (37 °C) and maintained in phenol red-free minimum essential medium supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate and 60 μm N-acetyll-cysteine during the observation as described previously (8Burack M.A. Silverman M.A. Banker G. Neuron. 2000; 26: 465-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Time-lapse images of moving KIF1A-EGFP were captured using a 63×/1.4 numerical aperture Plan-Apochromat objective and a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510) under the following settings: 30% intensity of argon laser to minimize bleaching and damage to neurons; maximum pinhole opening (7.5 μm) to cover most of the thickness of neurites; and 2–3× digital zoom for better viewing. One image of 512 × 512-pixel resolution was taken every 4.5 s (1.5 s of scanning + 3-s interval). The interval of 3 s was used to minimize laser-induced neuronal damages. Image analysis and generation of video clips were performed using the MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Statistical significance was assessed using the Student'st test. COS7 cells were transfected with combinations of GW1 KIF1A, GW1 KIF1A-EGFP, and pMT HA-liprin-α1 using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, COS cells were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, incubated with hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (Hoffmann-La Roche) followed by precipitation using the protein A-Sepharose resin (AmershamBiosciences). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with KIF1A (1131) and liprin-α (1127) antibodies. The microtubule (MT)-binding assay was performed as described previously (24Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Briefly, human embryonic kidney 293T cells transfected for 48 h with various KIF1A-EGFP constructs were solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES/KOH, 115 mm K+CH3COO−, 5 mm Na+CH3COO−, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, pH 7.2). After removing insoluble materials by centrifugation of the lysates at 50,000 rpm in the TLA 100.2 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was added with 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate (final concentration, 2.5 mm), paclitaxel (Taxol; 20 μm), and paclitaxel-stabilized MTs (0.5–1 mg/ml). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the mixture was overlaid on top of a lysis buffer bed (1/4 volume) containing 10% sucrose and 20 μm paclitaxel and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm in the SW55Ti rotor at 22 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was carefully removed and mixed with 2× SDS loading buffer. The precipitates were then washed with lysis buffer and paclitaxel and resuspended in 1× SDS loading buffer. The supernatants and precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with EGFP (1167) antibodies. To visualize the movements of KIF1A in living neurons, we generated a construct containing EGFP-tagged full-length KIF1A (KIF1A-EGFP). The EGFP domain was inserted into the site (between aa 680 and 681) in the middle of KIF1A around the N-terminal boundary of the liprin-α-binding domain (Fig. 1 A), a putative domain that binds to the multi-domain protein liprin-α.3Insertion of the EGFP domain to the N- or C-terminal end of KIF1A was not attempted because the insertion might have interfered with the function of the motor domain or potential cargo binding. Because the site of EGFP insertion in KIF1A was near the liprin-α-binding domain, we tested whether this insertion affected the interaction between the liprin-α-binding domain and liprin-α by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1 B). In COS cells doubly transfected with KIF1A (untagged or EGFP-tagged) and liprin-α1, both untagged and tagged KIF1A showed a similar coimmunoprecipitation with liprin-α1. We further tested whether the EGFP insertion affected the MT binding of KIF1A. When human embryonic kidney 293T cell lysates singly transfected with untagged KIF1A or KIF1A-EGFP were incubated with purified MTs, the proteins showed similar MT binding (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that the EGFP insertion does not affect the association of KIF1A with liprin-α or MTs. We next determined whether the subcellular distribution of KIF1A in neurons is affected by the EGFP insertion. When expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons, KIF1A-EGFP distributed to both MAP2-positive dendrites (Fig. 1 D) and neurofilament-H-positive axons (Fig. 1 E), which is similar to the distribution pattern of untagged exogenous KIF1A (data not shown) and endogenous KIF1A (Fig. 1 F) in cultured neurons. The localization of endogenous KIF1A in both dendrites and axons was further confirmed by the electron microscopic analysis of KIF1A distribution in rat brain neurons.3 Moreover, these results were consistent with the movements of Unc104 observed in both dendrites and axons of livingC. elegans neurons (10Zhou H.M. Brust-Mascher I. Scholey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3749-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In further support of the minimal effects of the EGFP insertion, EGFP-KIF1A moved processively along the neurites of living neurons at the high velocity of 1.0 μm/s (see below for more details), which is comparable with that of purified KIF1A in the in vitro gliding assay (1.2 μm/s) (1Okada Y. Yamazaki H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1995; 81: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and thein vivo movements of Unc104 in living C. elegansneurons (1.02 μm/s) (10Zhou H.M. Brust-Mascher I. Scholey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3749-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that KIF1A-EGFP possesses functional characteristics comparable with those of untagged exogenous and endogenous KIF1A. When expressed and visualized in living cultured hippocampal neurons, KIF1A-EGFP was primarily associated with fluorescent particles of various sizes and shapes (round or tubulovesicular) (Fig. 2,A–C). Because it was reported that overexpression of exogenous Unc104 in wild-type C. elegans neurons seems to interfere with normal Unc104-driven transport (10Zhou H.M. Brust-Mascher I. Scholey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3749-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we obtained time-lapse images of KIF1A movements only from neurons that expressed a moderate amount of KIF1A, with KIF1A particles sparsely dispersed over the neuronal processes. Quantitative analysis on these neurons indicated that the expression levels of EGFP-KIF1A were ∼40% of those of endogenous KIF1A; the average fluorescence intensity of EGFP-KIF1A-transfected neurons revealed by KIF1A antibodies was 140 ± 16% (n = 10) that of neighboring untransfected neurons (Fig. 2 D). These results suggest that the expression of EGFP-KIF1A is unlikely to exert dominant-negative effects in transfected neurons. When time-lapse images of transfected neurons were analyzed, prominent KIF1A movements were mainly observed in thin and distal neurites (Figs.3 A and 4, A andB), although KIF1A movements were also detected in thick and proximal neurites (Fig. 3 B), which may represent dendrites. The KIF1A particles in thick neurites, however, were mostly stationary. The stationary nature of KIF1A particles in proximal dendrites was further confirmed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, in which we observed limited movements of KIF1A in bleached regions (data not shown). The overall direction of KIF1A movements was anterograde (moving away from the cell body) (Fig. 3, A andB; supplementary movies 1 and 2), although retrograde movements were observed in 17.1% of particles observed (n = 293) (Fig. 4,A and B). Some KIF1A vesicles changed their direction of movement multiple times during observation (Fig. 4 B; supplementary movie 3). Importantly, the fluorescence intensity of moving KIF1A particles did not change significantly (95%,n = 20) during periods of retrograde movements, compared with that during anterograde movements, suggesting that KIF1A particles change their direction of movement, whereas KIF1A proteins remain associated. The average velocity of KIF1A particles during their persistent anterograde movements was 1.00 ± 0.61 μm/s (mean ± S.D., n = 243) (Fig. 5 A), whereas that of retrograde movement was 0.72 ± 0.27 μm/s (n = 50) (Fig. 5 B). The average durations of persistent anterograde and retrograde movements were 11.0 ± 7.1 s (n = 131) (Fig. 5 C) and 8.17 ± 3.72 s (n = 56) (Fig. 5 D), respectively.Figure 4Bidirectional movements of KIF1A.

Rose D.J. Gilbert S.P. Saxton W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31506-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 A). When these mutant KIF1As were expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons, most of the KIF1A particles exhibited little or no movement and mainly distributed to the region around the cell body (Fig. 6 A). Quantitative analysis showed that the number of moving KIF1A particles was significantly reduced in both KIF1A mutants (0.20 ± 0.31, n = 5, p < 0.0001 in ΔMD; 1.11 ± 0.74,n = 4, p < 0.001 in T312M; Student'st test) compared with the wild-type KIF1A (3.99 ± 1.16, n = 12) (Fig. 6 B), indicating that the observed movements of KIF1A are driven by the motor domain activity. In the present study, direct visualization of the movement of KIF1A enabled us to analyze the characteristics of KIF1A movements in living mammalian neurons. Several in vitro and in vivo assays were employed to determine the velocity and processivity (the distance that a motor protein moves along MTs before detaching) of movements for the KIF1 family proteins. In living C. elegans neurons, EGFP-tagged Unc104 moves at the high speed of 1.02 μm/s over distances of 5 μm along MTs before pausing (10Zhou H.M. Brust-Mascher I. Scholey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3749-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Scholey J.M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 515-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrated that DdUnc104 from Dictyostelium discoideummediates a processive (5–6 μm) transport of liposomes and native vesicles at 2.0–2.1 μm/s (26Scholey J.M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 515-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 27Klopfenstein D.R. Tomishige M. Stuurman N. Vale R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the same assay, truncated Unc104 proteins (aa 1–653, termed CeU653) displayed minimal transport activities, but fusion of the PH domain from D. discoideum(PHDdUnc104) to the C terminus of CeU653 dramatically stimulated cargo transports (processivity of 5–6 μm at 1.5–1.6 μm/s) (27Klopfenstein D.R. Tomishige M. Stuurman N. Vale R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, it has been recently reported that CeU653 can form a dimer and show a fast and processive unidirectional movement at high motor concentrations in the single-molecule fluorescence assay (processivity of 1.47 μm at 1.73 μm/s), suggesting that Unc104 may dimerize into a processive motor (28Tomishige M. Klopfenstein D.R. Vale R.D. Science. 2002; 297: 2263-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the case of murine KIF1A, the single motor assay with a KIF1A construct containing the catalytic core of the motor domain (aa 1–356) moved along MTs by a biased one-dimensional diffusion at the much slower speed of 0.14 μm/s, but with a high processivity (∼0.85 μm for 6.1 s) (29Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Science. 1999; 283: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). A longer KIF1A construct (aa 1–693) that is equivalent to CeU653 also exhibited fast (1.12 μm/s) and processive movements at higher motor concentrations in the single-molecule fluorescence assay (28Tomishige M. Klopfenstein D.R. Vale R.D. Science. 2002; 297: 2263-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In a conventional multi-motor gliding assay, both truncated and full-length KIF1A proteins showed movements of high velocity (1.2 μm/s) (1Okada Y. Yamazaki H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1995; 81: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 29Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Science. 1999; 283: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although these results are highly informative, the assays employed to measure KIF1A movements have some limitations, in that they do not measure the transport of KIF1A in association with cargoes and, more importantly, provide little information on in vivo transport, where a number of additional regulatory influences are integrated. Our data demonstrate that KIF1A moves processively (11 μm for 11 s) along the neurites of living neurons at a high velocity of 1.0 μm/s. The velocity and processivity of moving KIF1A in living neurons was comparable with that of Unc104 in living C. elegansneurons (10Zhou H.M. Brust-Mascher I. Scholey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3749-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that of KIF1A from in vitro assays (1Okada Y. Yamazaki H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1995; 81: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 28Tomishige M. Klopfenstein D.R. Vale R.D. Science. 2002; 297: 2263-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,29Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Science. 1999; 283: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). These results suggest that KIF1A mediates fast and processive neuronal transport in vivo and that the fast and processivein vivo movements are conserved in various KIF1/Unc104 family kinesin motors. One of the most prominent differences between the movements of KIF1A and Unc104 is that KIF1A showed limited movement in dendrites (Fig. 3 B), whereas Unc104 exhibited fast and processive movement in dendrites (10Zhou H.M. Brust-Mascher I. Scholey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3749-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A possible source of the limited movements of KIF1A in dendrites is the bidirectional nature of the MTs in the proximal dendrites of hippocampal neurons, which is in contrast to the unidirectional (plus-end-distal) polarity of axonal MTs (30Baas P.W. Deitch J.S. Black M.M. Banker G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8335-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). However, because we occasionally observed fast and processive anterograde movements in proximal dendrites (Fig. 3 B), additional mechanisms seem to regulate the movements of KIF1A in this region. In this regard, the active movements of Unc104 in C. elegansdendrites may reflect a different polarity of MTs in this region, or the presence of molecular mechanisms allowing fast and processive motor movements. KIF1A particles often move bidirectionally along neurites. Along with the previously reported bidirecitonal movements of Unc104 in living C. elegansneurons (10Zhou H.M. Brust-Mascher I. Scholey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3749-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results suggest that the KIF1/Unc104 family of kinesin motors exhibit bidirectional movements in vivo. What are the underlying molecular mechanisms? Because we measured KIF1A movements mostly in thin neurites, which are probably axons, the frequent retrograde movements of KIF1A are unlikely to be caused by the bidirectional orientation of MTs, but rather by the intrinsic properties of the KIF1A particles. It is generally accepted that moving organelles or vesicles associate with antagonizing populations of motors, the balance of which determines their direction of movement (31Goldstein L.S.B. Yang Z. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 39-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that KIF1A particles contain, in addition to KIF1A, other functionally antagonizing motors. In support of this hypothesis, KIF1A particles move bidirectionally at two different velocities: anterograde (1.0 μm/s) and retrograde (0.72 μm/s). Assuming that KIF1A particles contain antagonizing motors, a factor that may regulate their balance would be the attachment or detachment of antagonizing motors to and from their cargoes. Alternatively, the activities of antagonizing motor proteins may be regulated, whereas both motors remain associated with their cargoes, as suggested previously (31Goldstein L.S.B. Yang Z. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 39-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that KIF1A particles do not significantly change their fluorescence during periods of retrograde movements, suggesting that KIF1A particles may change their direction of movement by mechanisms other than the attachment/detachment of KIF1A proteins. A possible mechanism for the regulation of KIF1A activity is phosphorylation, which has been shown to regulate the motor activity and perhaps vesicle association of kinesin and dynein molecules (31Goldstein L.S.B. Yang Z. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 39-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar,32Sheetz M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). What is the fate of KIF1A at its destination? We demonstrated that the overall direction of KIF1A movements was in the anterograde direction. However, we did not observe any detectable accumulation of KIF1A in the periphery of neurons. A possible explanation for these results is that KIF1A is destroyed at its destination by the local machinery for protein degradation (31Goldstein L.S.B. Yang Z. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 39-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, previous studies in the peripheral nervous system have shown that plus-end-directed motor proteins targeted to the synapse do not return (33Yang Z. Goldstein L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Yamazaki H. Nakata T. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that KIF1A motors, in a diffuse form, may move back to the cell body by retrograde transport, as demonstrated previously for the cytoplasmic dynein-dependent retrograde transport of the anterograde kinesin-II motor in chemosensory neurons of C. elegans(37Signor D. Wedaman K.P. Orozco J.T. Dwyer N.D. Bargmann C.I. Rose L.S. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results, along with the previous report on Unc104 movement (10Zhou H.M. Brust-Mascher I. Scholey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3749-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), support the hypothesis that the KIF1/Unc104 family motors mediate fast and processive transport in living neurons of various species. Identification of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the intermittent retrograde movements of KIF1A and the minimal peripheral accumulation of KIF1A would be interesting directions for further study. Finally, the assay measuring motor movements in living neurons may be used in the future for identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate the motor activity and cargo association of KIF1A in vivo.

Similarities exist not only at the primary and secondary structure level but also at the tertiary structure level, as revealed by comparison of the respective DIS and A site crystal structures. Gel shift, inhibition of lead-induced cleavage, and footprinting experiments showed that paromomycin and neomycin specifically bind to the kissing-loop complex formed by the DIS, with an affinity and a geometry similar to that observed for the A site. Modeling of the aminoglycoside-DIS complex allowed us to identify antibiotic modifications likely to increase the affinity and/or the specificity for the DIS.

Due to a highly variable genome leading to rapid selection of mutations that confer resistance to enzymatic inhibitors, there is a strong need for targeting new viral molecules. New potential targets such as viral and cellular proteins involved in viral adsorption, fusion, and integration have been proposed (1De Clercq E. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Functional sites within the genomic RNA, such as the Tat-responsive element (2Wang S. Huber P.W. Cui M. Czarnik A.W. Mei H.Y.

Another interesting viral RNA target is the dimerization initiation site (DIS) of HIV-1 genomic RNA.

We recently solved the crystal structures of the DIS kissing-loop complexes of HIV-1 subtypes A and B (17Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that, unexpectedly, these structures are very similar to the ribosomal aminoacyl decoding site (A site) complexed with paromomycin (18Carter A.P. Clemons W.M. Brodersen D.E. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 19Vicens Q. Westhof E. Structure Fold Des. 2001; 9: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (344) Google Scholar), an aminoglycoside antibiotic interfering with translation in bacteria. Based on this similarity, we modeled a DIS kissing-loop complex binding two paromomycin molecules. This model is strongly supported by gel shift, inhibition of lead-induced cleavage, and RNA footprinting experiments that demonstrate the ability of the DIS to bind aminoglycosides in a highly sequence-specific manner. The model was obtained by superimposing residues involved in antibiotic binding in the paromomycin-A site crystal structure (19Vicens Q. Westhof E. Structure Fold Des. 2001; 9: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (344) Google Scholar) on their counterparts within the DIS kissing-loop complex crystal structure (17Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Using the program O (20Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), the sugar pucker of ribose 271 of the DIS structure was changed from C2′-endo to the C3′-endo conformation observed in the A site to prevent the steric clash with paromomycin. No other modification was required on the kissing-loop DIS crystal structure to obtain a conformation identical to that of the paromomycin-bound A site crystal structure (19Vicens Q. Westhof E. Structure Fold Des. 2001; 9: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Chemically synthesized 23-mer RNA fragments, corresponding to DIS subtypes A, B, and F, as well as A280U and U275C mutants of subtype A (7Paillart J.C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5572-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), were purchased from Dharmacon (Boulder, CO) and purified by ion-exchange chromatography using a Dionex PA-100 column as described (21Ennifar E. Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Kissing-loop complexes were obtained as follows: RNA was diluted to 6 μm in water, heat-denatured at 90 °C for 5 min, and then immediately cooled on ice for 5 min. Pure DIS extended duplex form was obtained by crystallization as described (21Ennifar E. Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and crystals were then dissolved in water. For band shift assays, after the addition of the dimerization buffer (final concentration: 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mmsodium cacodylate, 25 mm KCl) and antibiotic at different concentrations, the DIS was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Alternatively, the antibiotic was added before dimerization buffer with this protocol leading to the same result. Native 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C in TBM buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 0.1 mmMgCl2). RNA was revealed by staining with ethidium bromide. The U275C mutant, which cannot dimerize as a kissing-loop complex (7Paillart J.C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5572-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), was used as a monomer control. Tested aminoglycosides (purchased from Sigma) are shown in TableI. For lead probing, the DIS kissing-loop complex was incubated in acetate dimerization buffer (2 mmMgOAc2, 20 mm sodium cacodylate, 25 mm KOAc) for 25 min at 30 °C in the presence of 5 mm PbOAc2. The cleavage position was verified using 5′[γ32P]ATP-labeled RNA and an RNase T1 ladder (not shown).

The experiments in which the addition of the aminoglycoside had no effect are indicated by (−) and those showing a clear RNA bandshift or a footprint are indicated by (++). Chemical footprinting experiments were performed after the dimerization procedure on either wild-type or mutant 1–615 RNAs (400 nm) as described previously (22Paillart J.C. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNAs were allowed to dimerize in the dimerization buffer (50 mmsodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2) for 15 min at 37 °C. Then, antibiotics were added at various concentrations, and incubation was continued for 15 min. Chemical modification was carried out in the presence of 2 μg ofEscherichia coli total tRNA by the addition of dimethyl sulfate (Fluka) (0.8 μl, 1:20 dilution in ethanol) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 and 10 min. Reactions were stopped by precipitation in ethanol. Chain scission at methylated G-N7 was performed by aniline treatment as described (22Paillart J.C. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For each reaction, a control without alkylating reagent was treated in parallel. Modified/protected bases were detected by extension with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Q-biogene) of a 5′[γ32P]ATP-labeled primer complementary to residues 294 to 311 of the HIV-1 RNA as described (22Paillart J.C. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Lead probing was performed in acetate dimerization buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc2) by incubating RNA 1–615 for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mm PbOAc2. The subtype A RNA (23-mer) was diluted to 1.12 μm in 500 μl of water, heat-denatured at 90 °C for 4 min, and then immediately cooled at 0 °C for 10 min. After 15 min and incubation at 37 °C in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, the antibiotics were added to 5 or 50 μm in a final volume of 540 μl, and the incubation was continued for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were degassed and transferred in UV spectrometer cells. The fusion and cooling cycles were done on a Biotek UVIKON-XL spectrometer at 260 nm and a Biotek Peltier thermosystem. The heating or cooling rate of 0.5 °C/minute between 15 and 90 °C was driven by the LifePowerTm Junior 1.1 application. The melting curves were processed by using Mathematica 4.1 (Wolfram research). The raw data were processed with a double-step smoothing procedure, allowing us to retrieve more accurate information than by ordinary methods. Essentially, the method is based upon low pass Fourier filtering applied, first, on the melting curve itself (to suppress most of the point-to-point high frequency noise) and, second, on the much less noisy numerical derivative of the smoothed melting curve. Care was also taken to suppress totally the usual “Gibbs phenomenon” affecting both ends of a reconstructed curve by a Fourier series. Sequence specificity of aminoglycoside antibiotics (especially paromomycin) binding to the prokaryotic ribosomal A site has been extensively studied by mutagenesis and footprinting analysis (23Recht M.I.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3133-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and by surface plasmon resonance (26Wong C.H. Hendrix M. Priestley E.S. Greenberg W.A. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). First insights of the A site complexed with antibiotics were obtained by NMR (27Fourmy D. Recht M.I. Blanchard S.C. Puglisi J.D. Science. 1996; 274: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 28Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Puglisi J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6437-6448Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Recently, a more detailed view was provided by the crystal structures of paromomycin bound to the A site of the complete 16 S rRNA (18Carter A.P. Clemons W.M. Brodersen D.E. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) or to a small RNA fragment containing the A site (19Vicens Q. Westhof E. Structure Fold Des. 2001; 9: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Primary and secondary structure comparisons showed that the ribosomal A site (residues 1406–1410/1490–1495) is surprisingly similar to the dimeric HIV-1 DIS (residues 278–282/270–275). This fortuitous similarity holds true for the kissing-loop complex and duplex forms of the DIS since both topologies lead to identical base-pairing patterns (Fig. 2 a). However, some differences are observed depending on the considered HIV-1 subtype: residue 273 is a G (and not an A) in subtype A, and the 275–278* base pair (the asterisk represents the second molecule of the dimer) is either UA or CG for subtypes A and B, respectively, instead of the universally conserved UU mismatch in the A site. Notably, the kissing-loop complex formed by the subtype F DIS, having both A273 and U275 residues, is the closest to the A site (Fig. 2 A). In addition to these sequence similarities, the paromomycin-bound ribosomal A site and the HIV-1 DIS kissing-loop complex share an analogous three-dimensional structure essentially characterized by two consecutive bulged-out adenines stacked on each other across from an unpaired adenine stacked inside the helix (17Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Carter A.P. Clemons W.M. Brodersen D.E. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 19Vicens Q. Westhof E. Structure Fold Des. 2001; 9: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (344) Google Scholar). A superimposition of the two structures shows that most of the atomic sites engaged in antibiotic binding are conserved in the DIS with a 0.9-Å root mean square deviation (Fig. 2 B). The only steric conflict between the DIS and a bound antibiotic would occur between ribose 271 and the antibiotic ring I (Fig. 2 B). This ribose is in a C2′-endo conformation in the DIS but in C3′-endo in its A site counterpart (G1491). Since residue 271 is located at the end of a helical part and followed by two bulged-out residues, its ribose pucker is by no means restricted due to the very low energetic barrier between the two conformations (29Levitt M. Warshel A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 2607-2613Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and can thus easily return to the more usual C3′-endopucker. Supporting this view, there are many examples of mixed C2′-endo-C3′-endo conformations in NMR and crystal structures (e.g. (21Ennifar E. Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 30Girard F. Barbault F. Gouyette C. Huynh-Dinh T. Paoletti J. Lancelot G. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1999; 16: 1145-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, model building showed that only minor conformational changes of the bulged-out A272–R273 are required for the DIS to adopt an exact A site conformation (Fig. 3 a). Due to the difference in topology between the DIS kissing-loop complex and the A site duplex, only two nonspecific contacts between phosphate 1493 with the O4′ of ring I and the N3 of ring II of paromomycin are expected to be lost. Similarly, for subtype B, the presence of a C275*-G278 base pair would induce the loss of a direct contact between the O4(U275*) and the N1 of paromomycin ring II (Fig. 3 B). However, the presence of a guanine instead of an adenine at position 273 of the subtype A DIS has no influence on a putative antibiotic binding due to the bulged-out conformation of this residue. Notably, the three-dimensional similarities described above are not found in a previous NMR structure of the DIS kissing-loop complex (31Mujeeb A. Clever J.L. Billeci T.M. James T.L. Parslow T.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) due to the non-standard geometry of the interstrand loop-loop helix and the bulged-in unpaired purines (A272, A273) occluding the potential antibiotic binding pocket. Furthermore, the G271–C281 base pair (Fig. 2 A), whose homologue (C1409–G1491) is important for antibiotic binding in the A site, is not formed in the NMR structure. We first checked the binding of a collection of aminoglycosides by band shift experiments on 23-nucleotide fragments representative of minimal DIS of subtypes A, B, and F (Table I). Besides these natural sequences, we introduced two point mutations in the subtype A DIS: U275C, which inhibits kissing-loop complex formation (7Paillart J.C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5572-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and A280U, since this position corresponds to the A site A1408 and its mutation is expected to prevent antibiotic binding (23Recht M.I. Fourmy D. Blanchard S.C. Dahlquist K.D. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) but not dimerization. Among all tested antibiotics, only neomycin and paromomycin, differing only by a 6′NH3+ or 6′OH group (Table I and Fig. 4 a), yielded a significant band shift of the DIS kissing-loop complexes (Fig. 4 A and Table I). This band shift was observed whether the antibiotic was added before or after dimer formation. That the band shift was partial might possibly result from a dissociation of the complex under electrophoresis conditions. Importantly, binding was restricted to subtypes A and F (Fig. 4 A and Table I), indicating a sequence- and ligand-specific interaction. As expected from the model, mutant A280U did not bind neomycin (Fig. 4 A). We also checked antibiotic binding on dissolved crystals (21Ennifar E. Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) of the subtype A DIS duplex form. Interestingly, although this form corresponds to the A site topology (Fig. 2 A), we did not observe any antibiotic binding, even at millimolar concentrations (Fig. 4 A). This is in perfect agreement with two independent observations. First, the crystal structure of the DIS duplex form (21Ennifar E. Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) shows a G273*-A280 base pair (not observed in the kissing-loop complex topology (17Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)) closing the antibiotic pocket. Second, an A1493G mutation in the A site abolishes antibiotic binding (23Recht M.I. Fourmy D. Blanchard S.C. Dahlquist K.D. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), most likely by allowing formation of an A1408–G1493 base pair equivalent to G273*-A280 observed in the DIS duplex form. Finally, both paromomycin and neomycin are unable to dissociate the preformed kissing-loop complex (Fig. 4 A). As aminoglycosides were reported to modulate ribozyme cleavage by displacing metal ions (for a review, see Ref. 32Walter F. Vicens Q. Westhof E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we further checked antibiotic binding to the minimal DIS fragment, taking advantage of the strong lead-induced cleavage specifically observed for subtype A DIS (22Paillart J.C. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the absence of antibiotic, one strong cleavage was observed in the minimal DIS fragment between A272 and G273residues (Fig. 4 B) in the vicinity of the expected antibiotic binding site (Fig. 3 A). Even using a 5 mm Pb2+ concentration, cleavage was strongly reduced upon the addition of 15 μm paromomycin and abolished in the presence of 7.5 μm neomycin (Fig. 4 B). These aminoglycoside concentrations are 3 orders of magnitude lower than those required for inhibition of the tRNAPhe lead-induced cleavage (33Mikkelsen N.E. Johansson K. Virtanen A. Kirsebom L.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), indicating a highly specific antibiotic-DIS interaction. We then tested the DIS-antibiotic interactions in a much larger RNA context (Fig. 1) by using a 1–615 RNA fragment containing the whole 5′-untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome (Fig. 1). First, we verified that paromomycin and neomycin (but not tobramycin) also inhibit lead-induced cleavage of this RNA (Fig. 5 a and Fig. 6). Second, we noticed that the ribosomal A site and the HIV-1 DIS kissing-loop complex share a similar pattern of chemical modifications by alkylating agents (DMS and diethylpyrocarbonate) (Fig. 6) (22Paillart J.C. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 23Recht M.I. Fourmy D. Blanchard S.C. Dahlquist K.D. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 24Recht M.I. Douthwaite S. Dahlquist K.D. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 34Purohit P. Stern S. Nature. 1994; 370: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 35Miyaguchi H. Narita H. Sakamoto K. Yokoyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3700-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Such a similar pattern is well accounted for by the DIS kissing-loop crystal structure (17Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) but not by the corresponding NMR structure (31Mujeeb A. Clever J.L. Billeci T.M. James T.L. Parslow T.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, we probed antibiotic binding to 1–615 RNA using chemical footprinting. As expected from the model derived from our crystal structure (Fig. 3 A), we did observe strong protections against DMS modification of N1(A280) and N7(G274) positions in subtype A and F DIS upon the addition of neomycin and paromomycin (Figs. 5 (B and C) and 6, and Fig. S1 of the supplementary material). No other significant alteration of the chemical modification pattern was observed in the tested region (nucleotides 150–300) (Fig. S1 of the supplementary material). Interestingly, the minimal antibiotic concentrations necessary for maximal protection are comparable with those necessary for the same protection on the A site within the complete 16 S rRNA (24Recht M.I. Douthwaite S. Dahlquist K.D. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, again as expected from our model, only very weak protections of the subtype B DIS sequence were observed at 100 μmneomycin or paromomycin (Fig. 6, and Fig. S1 of the supplementary material), in agreement with the absence of band shift (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, no footprinting was observed on U275C (not shown) and A278G (Fig. S1 of the supplementary material) DIS mutants that are unable to dimerize (7Paillart J.C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5572-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The results concerning these two mutants will be discussed later. Finally, no protection was observed on any DIS sequences with the other antibiotics tested in agreement with our band shift experiments (Table I) and with their 10–100-fold weaker affinity for the ribosomal A site (26Wong C.H. Hendrix M. Priestley E.S. Greenberg W.A. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Figure 6Summary of the chemical modifications of the ribosomal decoding region (A site) and DIS kissing-loop complexes (subtypes A, F, and B). Nucleotides that are modified by DMS are indicated by a circle (position N1-A) or a square(position N7-G). Nucleotides protected from DMS modification by aminoglycoside antibiotics are indicated by open triangles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Notably, chemical probing did not reveal any increased accessibility of the DIS loop sequence upon binding of the antibiotics (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6), suggesting that it does not induce dissociation of the kissing-loop complex. Accordingly, both paromomycin and neomycin are unable to dissociate a preformed kissing-loop complex or to prevent dimerization even at 100 μm concentration (Fig. 4 A). Recently, neomycin was reported to bind to a monomeric DIS-containing 176-nucleotide fragment corresponding to the encapsidation region of subtype B HIV-1 genomic RNA (36McPike M.P. Sullivan J.M. Goodisman J. Dabrowiak J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2825-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The latter study seems to contradict our present results in which we show that neomycin does not bind either to a monomeric DIS mutant (Fig. S1 in the supplementary material) or to a subtype B DIS RNA (Table I and Fig. 4 A, and Fig. S1 of the supplementary material). However, the very low salt conditions used in the study by McPike et al. (36McPike M.P. Sullivan J.M. Goodisman J. Dabrowiak J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2825-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0), and especially the absence of divalent cations, might be responsible for this discrepancy. To gain some insight into the effect of antibiotic binding on kissing-complex stability, we performed a preliminary UV melting study of the subtype A DIS (23-mer) either alone or with a specific binder (neomycin or paromomycin). For negative control, we have also used the DIS with an unspecific binder (tobramycin). We did not use magnesium to limit the spontaneous hydrolysis of RNA during the high temperature conditions. In low salt conditions, adding any of the tested binders resulted in an important shift of the T m of the DIS from 55.3 °C to higher temperatures (79, 75.6, and 76.2 °C for 5 μm neomycin, paromomycin, and tobramycin, respectively), similar to the shift observed from the addition of 50 μmspermidine (73.5 °C) (not shown). In the presence of 100 mm NaCl, where the T m of the DIS alone increased to 65.6 °C, we noticed a smaller but fully significant stabilization by 6.4 °C for neomycin, a marginal one (1.7 °C) for paromomycin, and an insignificant one (0.7 °C) for tobramycin (Fig. 7). We interpret the effect of any of these positively charged molecules in low salt conditions as resulting from aspecific ionic interactions, whereas in more stringent salt conditions, only neomycin and, to a lesser extent, paromomycin showed a stabilizing effect. This can be correlated with the fact that neomycin also protects better than paromomycin against lead cleavage, whereas tobramycin does not protect at all (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, our present results on large RNA fragments strongly support the model (Fig. 3 A) that led to the experiments and the relevance of the crystal structure from which it was derived. Indeed, the antibiotic-bound A site crystal structures and the corresponding model for the DIS (Fig. 3 A) account for important features. First, that the A278–U275* pair present in subtypes A and F, but not in subtype B, is important for neomycin and paromomycin binding is consistent with the fact that the conserved U1406–U1495 pair in the A site can be changed to AU without affecting antibiotic binding (23Recht M.I. Fourmy D. Blanchard S.C. Dahlquist K.D. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 24Recht M.I. Douthwaite S. Dahlquist K.D. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Wong C.H. Hendrix M. Priestley E.S. Greenberg W.A. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, a U1495C mutation (thus making the A site closer to the subtype B DIS) led to a loss of antibiotic binding (24Recht M.I. Douthwaite S. Dahlquist K.D. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, our model shows that only U275* (U1495 in the A site) is engaged in antibiotic binding, whereas A278 is not (Fig. 3). Second, since the kissing-loop complex contains two identical copies of the A site motif (Fig. 1), it should bind two antibiotic molecules per kissing-loop complex. The model shows that this is possible without any steric conflict between the two ligands (Fig. 3 A). Experimentally, this is strongly supported by almost complete protections against lead-induced cleavage (Fig. 4 B) and DMS modification (Figs. 5 (B and C) and 6) upon antibiotic binding. Notably, binding of either neomycin or paromomycin to subtype A DIS should displace a magnesium cation that is bound through water molecules to the 275UGCA278 sequence in the loop-loop helix and that is important for a stable dimerization (17Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the subtype B DIS, which does not require magnesium for dimerization, does not bind magnesium on the corresponding 275CGCG278 sequence (17Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It thus appears that the presence of an H-bond donor amino group on C275, instead of an O4 H-bond acceptor as on U275, explains the lack of binding of both antibiotic and magnesium to the subtype B DIS. Finally, as residue 278 seems neutral for antibiotic binding, the lack of footprinting on the monomeric A278G DIS mutant suggests that neomycin and paromomycin binding is restricted to dimeric species. We have shown that, due to an unexpected resemblance to the prokaryotic ribosomal A site, subtypes A and F DIS kissing-loop complexes bind neomycin and paromomycin, likely displacing a magnesium ion. The binding of these aminoglycosides does not prevent dimerization and even provides further stabilization of the dimer. Since neomycin shows micromolar binding affinity to the DIS, neomycin-based aminoglycosides can be viewed as lead molecules for targeting the DIS in view of overstabilizing the dimer. One might anticipate that DIS binders might interfere with recognition of the DIS by the RNA encapsidation machinery and with the late stages of reverse transcription. However, it is necessary to test whether neomycin or paromomycin actually affect viral replication through their interaction at the level of the DIS. Experiments are in progress to address this point. Notably, neomycin has already been shown to inhibit the viral production of HIV-1 up to 85% in a dose-dependent fashion in U1 cells, although this was interpreted as the result of the inhibition of the Rev-RRE interaction by this aminoglycoside (3Zapp M.L. Stern S. Green M.R. Cell. 1993; 74: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Another important issue, not addressed in this study, is a possible adverse effect of the basic nucleocapsid protein on antibiotic binding. Molecular modeling of the DIS-antibiotic complex, based on solid facts and very minor assumptions, suggests guiding lines for a rational drug design aimed at improving ligand affinity or modifying its specificity. In particular, one would expect viral escape mutants to arise by adopting a subtype B DIS self-complementary sequence, which is insensitive to drugs tested in this study. This concern could be addressed by targeting the subtype B DIS sequence, which would require, for instance, the substitution of the hydroxyl group for the ammonium N1 group of ring II (Fig. 3 B). Another obvious improvement suggested by our model would be the use of symmetrical molecules, obtained by covalently linking the two drugs in interaction with the kissing-loop complex (Fig. 3 A). The link should involve the N1 (ring II) groups of each molecule, which are only 5.6 Å apart. As only rings I and II appear to be essential for binding, the size of such a symmetric drug could be reduced by suppressing rings III and IV,i.e. using a neamine core for symmetrization. Novel antibiotics that bind to the ribosomal A site were recently designed using such a neamine core and a drug design strategy (37Haddad J. Kotra L.P. Llano-Sotelo B. Kim C. Azucena E.F., Jr. Liu M. Vakulenko S.B. Chow C.S. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3229-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), thus showing that a rational approach for modifying and optimizing aminoglycosides is feasible. We are well aware, however, that these optimistic considerations should be moderated by keeping in mind the difficulties always encountered on the way from a potential antiviral molecule to a drug amenable to therapeutic use.

TrkA-GFP becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to NGF and is capable of initiating signaling cascades leading to prolonged MAPK activation and differentiation in PC12 nnr5 cells. TrkA constructs, progressively truncated in the carboxyl-terminal domain, were prepared as GFP chimerae in order to identify which part of the receptor intracellular domain is involved in its trafficking. Immunofluorescence observations show that TrkA-GFP is found mainly in cell surface membrane ruffles and in endosomes. Biochemical analysis indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of TrkA is not necessary for correct maturation and cell surface translocation of the receptor. An antibody against the extracellular domain of TrkA (RTA) was used as ligand to stimulate internalization and phosphorylation of TrkA.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1145-1154Google Scholar). Signaling by these proteins is believed to be mediated by binding to the neurotrophin receptor p75NTRand/or to one member of the Trk family. p75NTR binds to each neurotrophin with similar affinity. By contrast, Trk receptors exhibit differential affinity toward neurotrophins: TrkA binds preferentially to NGF,1 TrkB to BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophicfactor) and NT4–5, and TrkC to NT-3 (2Barbacid M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 442-458Google Scholar, 3Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 3: 262-267Google Scholar). Trk family members are tyrosine kinase receptors. Signaling by the NGF-TrkA complex is the best characterized. Upon NGF binding to the receptor, the tyrosine kinase domain of TrkA is activated, resulting in the autophosphorylation of two major tyrosines in the intracellular domain of the receptor (4Gryz E.A. Meakin S.O. Cunningham M.E. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 417-430Google Scholar). These phosphotyrosines are docking sites for several adaptor proteins that are involved in signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase C-γ (5Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Google Scholar). By contrast, p75NTR does not present any known catalytic activity in its cytoplasmic domain. Recent studies have reported the identification of several proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of p75NTR (6Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Google Scholar, 7Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Google Scholar, 8Chittka A. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl.

Depending on the interactor considered, binding of a given effector to p75NTR has been shown to be either enhanced or decreased by NGF binding. The precise roles of these proteins in the mediation of NGF signaling remain to be elucidated. In the case of neurons, additional specific spatial constraints for neurotrophin receptor signaling must be considered. The neurotrophin hypothesis postulates that the source of NGF for neurons is restricted to the target field of innervation (10Reynolds A.J. Bartlett S.E. Hendry I.A. Grimes M.L. Beattie E. Mobley W.C. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 169-178Google Scholar). Most often, cell bodies of neurons are located far from their target cells. Thus, neurotrophin is available only at the growth cone of the neuron. NGF-induced survival requires transmission of a signal from the axon tip to the cell body where transcriptional modifications are induced. Numerous studies indicate that the transmission of this NGF survival effect in neurons of the peripheral nervous system is supported by retrograde transport of NGF-TrkA complexes from the neurite tip to the cell body (11Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Google Scholar, 12Yano H. Lee F.S. Kong H. Chuang J. Arevalo J.

Science. 1997; 277: 1097-1100Google Scholar). This points to the importance of intracellular trafficking of neurotrophin receptors in the implementation of a response to their ligands. Indeed, NGF neuronal responsiveness is highly dependent upon NGF receptor targeting to where the growth factor is provided, namely the axon tip. Once complexed to its ligand, activated receptor is transported back to the cell body. Some of the intracellular trafficking steps underlying this process have been elucidated. Retrograde transport is initiated by internalization via the coated pit pathway (11Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5671-5678Google Scholar). After this step, TrkA is believed to undergo a microtubule-supported vesicular retrograde transport to the cell body (10Reynolds A.J. Bartlett S.E. Hendry I.A. Grimes M.L. Beattie E. Mobley W.C. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 169-178Google Scholar, 12Yano H. Lee F.S. Kong H. Chuang J. Arevalo J. Perez P. Sung C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC125Google Scholar). Internalization by coated pits appears to require trafficking motifs in the intracellular domain of internalized proteins. Two major trafficking motifs have been identified (18Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Google Scholar, 19Rohn W.M. Rouille Y. Waguri S. Hoflack B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2093-2101Google Scholar). These motifs are short stretches of amino acids corresponding to either the dileucine type (two adjacent leucines or a leucine and an isoleucine) or to the tyrosine-based type (YXXφ or NPXY type, whereX is any amino acid, and φ is a hydrophobic amino acid). In addition to their involvement in the internalization processes, these trafficking motifs appear to mediate the recruitment of a receptor along numerous trafficking pathways ranging from targeting to specific cell surface domains to accumulation in defined intracellular sites (19Rohn W.M. Rouille Y. Waguri S. Hoflack B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2093-2101Google Scholar, 20Holman G.D. Sandoval I.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 173-179Google Scholar, 21Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 379-389Google Scholar). Signal-mediated protein targeting is believed to be supported by recognition of these motifs by members of the adaptor complex family. The aim of the present study was to gain insight into TrkA trafficking steps prior to and during exposure to NGF and the resulting differentiation process. The intracellular domain of TrkA contains numerous potential trafficking motifs of the tyrosine-based and dileucine types. Involvement of these motifs in TrkA trafficking has been investigated using receptor chimerae designed with TrkA progressively truncated from the carboxyl terminus in phase with GFP. Data are presented indicating that fusion of GFP to full-length TrkA does not modify the expected functioning of the receptor. Cell surface translocation together with NGF-induced internalization of receptor chimera have also been analyzed to ascertain which parts of the TrkA cytoplasmic domain are involved in trafficking of the receptor. Confocal time-lapse analysis of TrkA-GFP trafficking during NGF-induced differentiation was undertaken to visualize and evaluate the kinetics of the actual trafficking of the receptor. A description of TrkA localization at different phases of differentiation is presented together with the major fluxes occurring between cellular compartments during this process. Sulfo-NHS-biotin and streptavidin-agarose were purchased from Pierce. Anti-TrkA extracellular domain (RTA) was prepared as described previously (22Clary D.O. Weskamp G. Austin L.R. Reichardt L.F.

NGF from mouse submaxillary glands was from Quality Controlled Biologicals. Protein A-Sepharose 4 fast flow was from Amersham Biosciences. K252-a was fromCalbiochem, and Polybrene was from Sigma. DC971 retroviral vector encoding rat neuronal TrkA has been described (22Clary D.O. Weskamp G. Austin L.R. Reichardt L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 549-563Google Scholar). An EGFP insert was prepared by PCR reaction using GFP-ol5′ and GFP-ol3′ primer, allowing the introduction of ClaI site in 3′ of EGFP stop codon and StuI and NsiI site in 5′ of EGFP start codon (GFP-ol5′, 5′-ATAGGCCTTG ATGCATATGGTGAGCA AGGGCGAGG-3′;GFP-ol3′, 5′-CCATCGATTT ATCTAGATCC GGTGGATC-3′). The Δ1 chimera is the result of EGFP ligation between the ClaI andStuI sites of DC971. This ligation create an in-frame fusion between the EGFP amino terminus and a truncated TrkA carboxyl terminus missing 4 amino acids of TrkA carboxyl terminus. Full-length TrkA-EGFP fusion (Δ0) was reconstituted by ligating prehybridized End1 and End2 complementary oligonucleotides between the NsiI andStuI sites of Δ1 (End1, 5′-CCTTGGCACA GGCGCCACCG AGTTACCTGG ACGTTCTGGG CATGCA-3′; End2, 5′-TGCCCAGAAC GTCCAGGTAA CTCGGTGGCG CCTGTGCCAA GG-3′). Other truncated constructs were produced using the kit Erase-a-Base (Promega).ExoIII digestion was performed on anNsiI/StuI-digested Δ0 plasmid, and all subsequent steps were performed following user guide instructions. Kinase-dead Δ0 (Δ0-KD) corresponds to a Δ0 construct carrying a point mutation, K547N, which inactivates the kinase activity of TrkA. This construct was obtained by mutating pLNCX-Δ0 using the Transformer mutagenesis kit (Clontech) with the following primers:Select-ol, 5′-CATCATTGGAA AACGCGTTTC GGGGCGAAAA CTC-3′;K547N-ol, 5′-GCTGGTGGCT GTCAACGCAC TGAAGGAGAC ATC-3′. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing (ABI Prism kit, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). pcDNA3-ΔECTO was generously provided by Dr. A. Pandiella (Instituto de Microbiologia Bioquimica, Salamanca, Spain). ΔECTO insert was extracted from pcDNA3 vector and subcloned into the pIRES-2 EGFP vector from Clontech. Intact cells were incubated for 45 min in ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin. Cells were then washed four times in PBS supplemented with 2 mm lysine to remove unbound reactive biotin. After cell surface biotinylation, proteins were extracted using ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mmβ-glycero-phosphate, 6 mm sodium-fluoride). The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Cleared lysate was then subjected to precipitation with streptavidin-agarose beads to obtain the cell surface fraction. In TrkA-GFP immunoprecipitation experiments, cleared lysates were precipitated using the JL-8 antibody directed against EGFP. Immunocomplexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose beads and eluted by boiling for 10 min in sample buffer. Proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Cells were collected at 37 °C in PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm EDTA. After centrifugation cells were resuspended in culture medium and subjected to 50 ng/ml NGF treatment at 37 °C on a rotating wheel. Cells were then washed twice in ice-cold PBS and used as “live intact cells” for immunolabeling. All of the subsequent labeling steps were performed on ice. Cells were washed twice in blocking buffer (PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide) and incubated for 30 min in the same buffer containing an antibody directed against RTA. After two washes in blocking buffer, cells were exposed to phycoerythrin-labeled secondary antibody for 30 min and washed three more times. Cells were then analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with an argon ion laser tuned to 488 nm. Emission fluorescence was measured with a 585-42-nm dichroic filter (phycoerythrin fluorescence) or a 530-30 bandpass filter (EGFP fluorescence). Data acquisition and analysis were performed with CellQuestTM software (BD Biosciences). Internalization efficiency was calculated from the amplitude of the shift in the geometric mean of the phycoerythrin signal between treated and untreated GFP-positive cells. PC12 cells, PC12 nnr5 cells (obtained from Dr. P. Barker; Montreal Neurological Institute), and PC12 6–24 cells over-expressing human neuronal TrkA (provided by Dr. D.

Cosset, Lyon, France) were transfected with retroviral vector encoding TrkA-GFP constructs and selected with G418 for 3 weeks. Stably transfected helper cells, in the exponential phase of growth, were incubated for 12–16 h in complete PC12 cell medium. Vectors were prepared by filtering the medium on a 45-μm filter. PC12 nnr5 or HeLa cells were pretreated for1 h with 12 μg/ml Polybrene and then incubated for 8 h in the presence of filtered vector. After three rounds of infection, cells were selected for neomycin resistance. PC12 cells were transfected with TrkA-GFP vector. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were spread on collagen poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (24Urdiales J.L. Becker E. Andrieu M. Thomas A. Jullien J. van Grunsven L.A. Menut S. Evan G.I.

At 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed for 10 min in PBS, 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized for 1 min in PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100. After being washed with PBS, cells were blocked with PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody for 30 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated for an additional 30 min with secondary antibody. After washing, cells were mounted in Moviol. Scanning fluorescence images were acquired using the MRC1000 confocal laser unit (Bio-Rad) coupled to a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a Zeiss X40, C-APO, 1.3 NA oil immersion objective. Confocal time-lapse fluorescence images were acquired using the MRC1000 confocal laser unit (Bio-Rad) coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with a Zeiss X40, C-APO, 1.3 NA oil-immersion objective. Cells were maintained at 37 °C, and analyses were performed in a CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) to avoid medium acidification in a CO2-free atmosphere. GFP bleaching experiments were performed using the photobleaching module of LSM 510 software (Zeiss) with a 488-nm argon laser set to 100% power. In vesicle tracking experiments, pinholes of the confocal unit were set so that the optical slice obtained encompassed the entire thickness of the structure studied. Unless specified, pinhole settings were ∼1 airy/unit. A TrkA-GFP chimera, named Δ0, was engineered by the addition of EGFP to the carboxyl terminus of rat neuronal TrkA (Fig.1 A). Deletion mutants of TrkA-GFP with sequential truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor were constructed to test the potential involvement of the dileucine and tyrosine-based motifs in trafficking of TrkA (Fig.1 A). Fig. 1 B indicates the terminal amino acid of each TrkA deletion mutant, the potential trafficking motif that was removed with respect to the previous construct, the theoretical kinase activity based on published information on structure activity, and finally, the tyrosine involved in the known signaling pathways still present in the construct. In the following presentation, TrkA-GFP will be used to refer to all of the truncated chimeric receptors, whereas Δn will refer to the fusion of GFP with a specific truncated TrkA mutant missing n potential trafficking motifs (Fig.1 A). The expression and cellular localization of the various constructs were initially characterized in the absence of NGF. Particular attention was given to the analysis of cell surface targeting of TrkA because this event is crucial in determining cellular responsiveness to NGF. Confocal microscopy observations indicate that Δ0 is targeted essentially to two cellular locations at steady state in the absence of NGF. Δ0 accumulates mainly at an internal perinuclear location and is also found at the cellular periphery in the form of discrete bright punctate structures (arrows in Fig. 2,D,G, and J, respectively). Double labeling experiments with the endoplasmic reticulum marker calreticulin indicate that the relatively faint diffuse intracellular TrkA labeling corresponds to receptors located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (arrows in Fig. 2, A–C). The intracellular perinuclear compact labeling of Δ0 may be attributed, at least in part, to an endosomal location, as shown by co-localization with the endosomal marker Tnf-R (Fig. 2, D–F). Cell surface TrkA has been detected by immunolabeling unpermeabilized cells with an antibody directed against the TrkA extracellular domain. The cell surface TrkA labeling co-localizes with peripheral Δ0-positive dots (Fig. 2,G–I). Thus, it appears that the Δ0 peripheral labeling reflects the localization of cell surface TrkA. These discrete Δ0 cell surface structures also appear to co-localize with peripheral actin, a well known marker of membrane ruffles (Fig. 2,J–L). The same kind of confocal microscopy analysis was undertaken with TrkA-GFP deletion constructs. Characteristic patterns of distribution are presented in Fig. 3. Δ0 and kinase-dead Δ0 (Δ0-KD) exhibit strong endosomal expression, Δ2 more diffuse cellular endoplasmic reticulum distribution, and Δ8 very weak endosomal location with strong membrane expression. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table I. This study shows that Δ0, Δ1, and ΔECT appear to accumulate in the perinuclear endosomal compartment at much higher levels than other constructs. It appears that all of the truncated TrkA constructs, with the exception of ΔTM and ΔECT, are targeted to the cell surface membrane ruffles of PC12 cells. A biochemical study was undertaken to analyze the maturation and cell surface targeting of TrkA constructs at a molecular level.Figure 3Cellular localization of TrkA-GFP chimera. Intracellular localization of TrkA was investigated in transiently transfected PC12 cells by confocal microscopy.

In PC12 cells, synthesis and cell surface translocation of TrkA involve the sequential production of two forms of the receptor. The receptor is synthesized initially in the rough endoplasmic reticulum as a 110-kDa form, which contains a 30-kDa N-linked sugar moiety (25Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Google Scholar,26Watson F.L. Porcionatto M.A. Bhattacharyya A. Stiles C.D. Segal R.A. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 323-336Google Scholar). During the time course of receptor targeting to the cell surface, this gp110TrkA precursor is matured to a 140-kDa form, gp140TrkA (Fig.4 A) The additional apparent 30-kDa molecular mass shift between mature and precursor forms of TrkA is believed to be the result of modification in the carbohydrate moiety of the receptor (54Jullien J. Guili V. Reichardt L.F. Rudkin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38700-38708Google Scholar). Synthesis and maturation of TrkA-GFP chimerae were evaluated by Western blot (Fig. 4 A). All of the constructs tested, with the exception of the soluble ΔTM mutant, exhibited two different molecular mass forms of the receptor. The molecular mass of the smallest forms appears to be about 30 kDa higher than the calculated molecular mass of the polypeptide backbone. This difference is similar to that observed for the endogenous TrkA of PC12 cells, suggesting that these extra 30 kDa correspond to theN-linked oligosaccharides normally added to the receptor. The molecular mass difference between the two forms of a chimeric receptor also appears to be close to 30 kDa, which is also comparable with the difference seen between gp110TrkA and gp140TrkA. These data suggest that synthesis and maturation of the TrkA-GFP chimera are similar to that observed with the wild type receptor. Pulse-chase analysis confirmed the precursor to mature protein relationship between the two forms of each chimeric receptor (not shown). It can be noted further from this experiment and from Western blot analysis that no preferential cleavage of GFP from the chimeric receptor was observed. These observations confirm the fidelity of GFP as a tag to follow the expression and fate of the TrkA receptor. Cell surface targeting of TrkA-GFP constructs was observed by both flow cytometric analysis and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figs. 2and 4 C). Cell surface localization of TrkA-GFP chimerae was observed at the molecular level by cell surface biotinylation. In PC12 cells, the mature form of wild type TrkA is the only form translocated to the cell surface (Fig. 4 B,left panel). As shown in Fig. 4 B, Δ0, Δ1, Δ2, Δ4, and Δ8 are also correctly targeted to the plasma membrane because only the mature forms of the chimeric receptors are labeled by biotinylation of cell surface proteins. Thus, neither exogenous receptor expression nor the addition of the GFP tag appear to affect maturation and cell surface targeting of TrkA in PC12 cells. Intracellular trafficking of TrkA-GFP in response to NGF was analyzed. NGF binding to wild type TrkA induces internalization and degradation of the receptor. Flow cytometric analysis of NGF-induced internalization of TrkA-GFP chimerae from the cell surface was performed in transiently transfected PC12 nnr5 cells. Fig. 4 C shows that the chimeric receptors can be separated into three categories with regard to NGF-induced internalization. The first category, which includes Δ0 and Δ1, demonstrated internalization properties similar to those of wild type TrkA. Δ2, Δ3, Δ4, and Δ6 showed slightly enhanced NGF-induced internalization as compared with the first group. Finally, the most deleted construct (Δ8) has greatly reduced internalization capability. This observation suggests that there are at least two kinds of trafficking determinants in the cytoplasmic domain of TrkA, which regulate NGF-induced internalization. A negative regulator of this phenomenon is lost in the Δ2-Δ6 mutants, whereas a positive regulator of NGF-induced internalization is lost in Δ8. Following internalization of the NGF-TrkA complex, the receptor is targeted to the lysosome for degradation (11Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Google Scholar, 54Jullien J. Guili V. Reichardt L.F. Rudkin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38700-38708Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 D, NGF-induced degradation of transiently transfected receptor is restricted to the Δ0 and Δ1 chimeric receptors and to wtTrkA. It suggests that the process of NGF-induced TrkA degradation requires trafficking information in the carboxyl terminus of the receptor, which is missing in the Δ2–Δ8 constructs. We tested the ability of TrkA-GFP chimerae to promote signaling events upon binding of NGF. In PC12 cells, NGF treatment induces autophosphorylation of endogenous TrkA (Fig. 5 A). PC12 nnr5 cells, a variant cell line devoid of TrkA receptor, do not respond to NGF (27Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Google Scholar, 28Eveleth D.D. Bradshaw R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 291-299Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of TrkA-GFP chimerae was tested in PC12 nnr5 cells stably expressing TrkA-GFP constructs. As shown in Fig.2 A, NGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the mature form of Δ0 and Δ1 chimerae. As expected, the Δ2 construct, which is lacking crucial amino acids in the catalytic domain of the kinase, is not phosphorylated in response to the growth factor. This observation suggests that the NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Δ0 and Δ1 is indeed the result of autophosphorylation of the receptor rather than a transphosphorylation of the chimera by an NGF-activated endogenous kinase. The kinetics of NGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation was also investigated. Fig. 5 A shows that in PC12 cells, phosphorylation o"

Flt3, a receptor tyrosine kinase closely related to PDGF receptors and c-Kit is, however, not inhibited by STI-571. Sequence alignments of different kinases and indications from the crystal structure of the STI-571 Abl kinase complex revealed amino acid residues that are probably crucial for this activity profile. It was predicted that Flt3 Phe-691 in the β5 strand may sterically prevent interaction with STI-571. The point mutants Flt3 F691T and PDGFβ-receptor T681F were constructed, and kinase assays showed that the Flt3 mutant but not the PDGFβ-receptor mutant is inhibited by STI-571. Docking of STI-571 into computer models of the PDGFβ-receptor and Flt3 kinase domains and comparison with the crystal structure of the STI-571 Abl kinase complex indicated very similar binding sites among the three nonphosphorylated kinases, suggesting corresponding courses of their Asp-Phe-Gly motifs and activation loops. Accordingly, we observed reduced sensitivity of preactivated compared with nonactivated PDGFR-β for the inhibition by STI-571. Courses of the activation loop that collide with STI-571 binding explain its inactivity at other kinases as the insulin receptor. The binding site models of PDGFR-β and Flt3 were applied to predict structural approaches for more selective PDGFβ-receptor inhibitors.

Because of its pharmacological profile and therapeutic potential, the phenylaminopyrimidine STI-571 (GleevecTM, formerly CGP57148B) has received much attention. This compound inhibits Abelson tyrosine kinases (c-Abl, BCR-Abl) platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) α- and β-receptor and c-Kit kinase activity with similar potency (4Buchdunger E. Cioffi C.L.

Based on inhibition of BCR-Abl, STI-571 has recently been introduced successfully into the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (5Mauro M.J. O'Dwyer M. Heinrich M.C. Druker B.J. J. Clin.

Further clinical applications of STI-571 may rest on the inhibition of c-Kit and PDGF receptors and on the established role of these kinases in certain forms of cancer. Two crystal structures of the murine Abl kinase in complex with STI-571 and with a smaller variant (6Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J.

Flt3 may, therefore, be a suitable target for therapy of Flt3-dependent leukemias. Despite its close homology to PDGF receptors, Flt3 kinase is not inhibited by STI-571.Multiple sequence alignments and the three-dimensional structure of the Abl kinase STI-571 complex (6Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar) indicate possible reasons for selectivity. In some chronic myelogenous leukemia patients who responded initially to STI-571 but then relapsed, the resistance to the drug was associated with a single T315I mutation in the β5 strand of the Abl kinase domain (18Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L. Science. 2001; 293: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). The side chain of Thr-315 is assumed to form a critical O–HN hydrogen bond with the pyrimidinylamino group of STI-571. Replacement of Abl Thr-315 by IRK Met-1076 has been suggested as responsible for the inactivity of the drug at the nonphosphorylated insulin receptor kinase (6Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, the selectivity of the ATP site inhibitor PP1/AGL1872 to p60c-Src versus v-Src kinase is related to the replacement of p60c-Src Thr-338, which corresponds to Abl Thr-315, by a v-Src Ile residue (19Liu Y. Bishop A. Witucki L. Kraybill B. Shimizu E. Tsien J. Ubersax J. Blethrow J. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Abl Thr-315 is equivalent to Thr-681 in the PDGFβ receptor kinase and to Phe-691 in Flt3. Considering the 23 residues within 3 Å around STI-571 in the Abl kinase crystal structure, 1iep (20Nagar B. Bornmann W.G. Pellicena P. Schindler T. Veach D.R. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar), this Thr → Phe replacement in β5 is indeed the only significant difference between the STI-571 binding kinases, Abl and PDGFR, on the one hand, and the nonbinding kinase Flt3, on the other hand. To investigate whether sterical hindrance by the Phe-691 side chain prevents inhibition of Flt3 by the drug, cross-wise amino acid exchanges between Flt3 and PDGFR-β were performed and analyzed for inhibitor sensitivity in the present study. Computer models of the STI-571 kinase complexes, based on sequence alignments and homology modeling using crystal structures of four different tyrosine kinases, provided further details of the binding mechanism.

Flt3 (Flk2, STK1) is structurally closely related to the PDGF receptor kinases and c-Kit. It is overexpressed in various types of leukemia, including B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia as well as T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis cells (15Carow C.E.

Flt3 may, therefore, be a suitable target for therapy of Flt3-dependent leukemias. Despite its close homology to PDGF receptors, Flt3 kinase is not inhibited by STI-571. Multiple sequence alignments and the three-dimensional structure of the Abl kinase STI-571 complex (6Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar) indicate possible reasons for selectivity. In some chronic myelogenous leukemia patients who responded initially to STI-571 but then relapsed, the resistance to the drug was associated with a single T315I mutation in the β5 strand of the Abl kinase domain (18Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L. Science. 2001; 293: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). The side chain of Thr-315 is assumed to form a critical O–HN hydrogen bond with the pyrimidinylamino group of STI-571. Replacement of Abl Thr-315 by IRK Met-1076 has been suggested as responsible for the inactivity of the drug at the nonphosphorylated insulin receptor kinase (6Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, the selectivity of the ATP site inhibitor PP1/AGL1872 to p60c-Src versus v-Src kinase is related to the replacement of p60c-Src Thr-338, which corresponds to Abl Thr-315, by a v-Src Ile residue (19Liu Y. Bishop A. Witucki L. Kraybill B. Shimizu E. Tsien J. Ubersax J. Blethrow J. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Abl Thr-315 is equivalent to Thr-681 in the PDGFβ receptor kinase and to Phe-691 in Flt3. Considering the 23 residues within 3 Å around STI-571 in the Abl kinase crystal structure, 1iep (20Nagar B. Bornmann W.G. Pellicena P. Schindler T. Veach D.R. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar), this Thr → Phe replacement in β5 is indeed the only significant difference between the STI-571 binding kinases, Abl and PDGFR, on the one hand, and the nonbinding kinase Flt3, on the other hand. To investigate whether sterical hindrance by the Phe-691 side chain prevents inhibition of Flt3 by the drug, cross-wise amino acid exchanges between Flt3 and PDGFR-β were performed and analyzed for inhibitor sensitivity in the present study. Computer models of the STI-571 kinase complexes, based on sequence alignments and homology modeling using crystal structures of four different tyrosine kinases, provided further details of the binding mechanism.

In plants and bacteria, the first and the third steps of methionine and threonine biosynthesis are catalyzed by isoforms of the bifunctional enzyme, aspartate kinase (AK) 1The abbreviations used are: AK, aspartate kinase; TD, threonine deaminase, HSDH, homoserine dehydrogenase 1The abbreviations used are: AK, aspartate kinase; TD, threonine deaminase, HSDH, homoserine dehydrogenase(EC 2.7.2.4)-homoserine dehydrogenase (HSDH) (EC 1.1.1.3) (1Cohen G.N.

In Escherichia coli, the expression of one of these bifunctional enzymes is repressed by methionine (3Zakin M.M. Duchange N. Ferrara P. Cohen G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3028-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the expression of the other enzyme is repressed by threonine (4Katinka M. Cossart P. Sibilli L. Saint-Girons I. Chalvignac M.A. Le Bras G. Cohen G.N. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5730-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The activity of this later bifunctional isoform is also inhibited by threonine. The threonine-sensitive isoform has been extensively characterized in bacteria (5Falcoz-Kelly F. Janin J. Saari J.C.

Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3512-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is a homotetramer containing two threonine-binding sites per monomer (5Falcoz-Kelly F. Janin J. Saari J.C. Véron M.

Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3512-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the two threonine-binding sites of the bacterial enzyme have not yet been identified, preliminary work has demonstrated that the regulatory domain of the bacterial enzyme is located in the intermediary region (amino acids segment 316–447) between the AK catalytic domain (amino acids segment 1–315) and the HSDH catalytic domain (amino acids segment 448–812) (7Fazel A.

Komatsubara S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 959-965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, internal sequence comparisons carried out on the E. coli enzyme indicated that the intermediary region corresponding to the regulatory domain is composed of two homologous subdomains (316–366 and 397–447) sharing 47% of amino acid identities (9Ferrara P. Duchange N. Zakin M. Cohen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3019-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In plants, two genes encoding bifunctional AK-HSDH were also found (12Weiseman J.M. Matthews B.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Ghislain M.

The corresponding isoforms exhibit high homologies with the bacterial threonine-sensitive AK-HSDH. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the genes encoding the two AK-HSDH are located on chromosome 1 (13Ghislain M. Frankard V. Vandenbassche D. Mattews B.F. Jacobs M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number trEMBL Q9SA18) and on chromosome 4 (GenBanktmaccession number trEMBL O81852). As a first step toward a structural characterization of the bifunctional threonine-sensitive AK-HSDH in plants, we reported previously (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) on the purification to homogeneity of one isoform from A. thaliana (trEMBL O81852). In the present paper the organization of the regulatory domain ofA. thaliana AK-HSDH is examined. Comparisons of predicted secondary structures of the biosynthetic threonine deaminase (TD) and AK-HSDH as well as the knowledge of TD three-dimensional structure (17Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Xiai G. Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Chinchilla D. Eisenstein E. Structure. 1998; 6: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,18Wessel P. Graciet E. Douce R. Dumas R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15136-15143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) allowed us to point to two amino acids in the AK-HSDH regulatory domain sequence potentially involved in the two threonine-binding sites of the enzyme. These amino acids were mutated, and the kinetic behavior of the mutants was determined and compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. Results indicate that the position of the amino acid in the threonine-binding sites was predicted correctly. Moreover, steady-state kinetics allow us to propose a structural model for the mechanism of control of AK and HSDH activities by threonine. New England Biolabs supplied restriction endonucleases. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals and amino acids by Sigma. Oligonucleotides used for PCR amplifications and site-directed mutageneses were obtained from Genome Express (Meylan, France). Chicken liver malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) was purchased from Sigma. Site-directed mutageneses were carried out on the previously constructed pET23/AK-HSDH vector (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides were designed to replace Gln443 and Gln524 of the A. thalianaAK-HSDH by alanine and to modify the restriction enzyme digestion profile for identification of mutants. Sequencing of the mutants was performed (Genome Express) and showed no mutations other than those desired. Overproduction and purification of the A. thaliana mutants were carried out as published previously for the wild-type AK-HSDH enzyme (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). AK activity was assayed in the forward direction by the hydroxamate method (19Bryan P.A. Cawley R.D. Brunner C.E. Bryan J.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 41: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was expressed as micromoles of aspartyl-P produced per min−1per mg−1 of protein using an ε505 nm of 750m−1cm−1. The assay mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mmhydroxylamine-KOH, pH 8.0, 0–50 mm aspartate-KOH, pH 8.0, 0–40 mm ATP-KOH, pH 8.0, 20 mmMgCl2, and 150 mm KCl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of AK-HSDH enzyme (final volume, 1 ml) and was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of a 0.5-ml solution of 0.37 mFeCl3, 20% trichloroacetic acid, and 0.72m HCl. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 505 nm. Aspartate semialdehyde is not available as a commercial product. Therefore, HSDH activity was first assayed in the nonphysiological direction (aspartate semialdehyde synthesis from homoserine and NADP+). Enzyme activity was expressed as micromoles of NADPH produced per min−1 per mg−1 of protein using an ε340 nm of 6250m−1·cm−1. The mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 0–1 mm NADP+, and 0–50 mm homoserine. The reaction was initialized by the addition of AK-HSDH enzyme (final volume, 1 ml) and was carried out at 37 °C. Enzyme activity was visualized by monitoring absorbance changes at 340 nm. HSDH activity was also measured in the forward direction. In this case, aspartate semialdehyde was produced from aspartate and ATP using monofunctional aspartate kinase and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.11). Aspartate semialdehyde was produced extemporaneously in a medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mmaspartate-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm ATP-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm NADPH, and 100 mml-malate-KOH, pH 8.0. Production of aspartate semialdehyde was initiated by the addition of 30 μg of pure A. thaliana monofunctional AK (overproduced and purified in our laboratory) 2G. Curien, unpublished result. and 70 μg of pure A. thaliana aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (20Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Regeneration of NADPH was driven by the addition of 25 μg of commercial chicken liver malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C in a volume of 250 μl. Protein was then eliminated by centrifugation on Nanosep 10K (Pall Filtron). Aspartate semialdehyde concentration in the eluate was then determined enzymatically with an excess of NADPH and AK-HSDH. Enzyme activity was expressed as micromoles of NADPH transformed per min−1 per mg−1 of protein using an ε340 nm of 6250m−1·cm−1. The mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 0–1 mm NADPH, and 0–5 mm aspartate semialdehyde. The reaction was initiated by the addition of AK-HSDH enzyme (final volume, 250 μl) and was carried out at 37 °C. Enzyme activity was visualized by monitoring absorbance changes at 340 nm. Molecular mass determinations were carried out on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex S 200 (AmershamBiosciences) column equilibrated in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol (v/v) with (5 mm) or without threonine. SDS-PAGE were performed according to Chua (21Chua N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 434-436Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured either by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211941) Google Scholar) (for crude extracts only) with bovine γ-globulin as standard or by measuringA 205 as described by Scopes (23Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were fitted with the appropriate theoretical equations by using the KaleidaGraph program (Abelbeck software). Secondary structure analyses were carried out with the program SOPM available on the Expasy web site (24Gourgeon C. Deléage G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A search of homologies was carried out with the Pfam protein data base (25Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). It was previously shown by internal sequence comparison that the E. colithreonine-sensitive AK-HSDH regulatory domain is composed of two homologous subdomains (9Ferrara P. Duchange N. Zakin M. Cohen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3019-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This feature is also found for A. thaliana threonine-sensitive AK-HSDH (Fig. 1). Indeed, subdomain 1 (residues 414–453) and subdomain 2 (residues 495–534) of the plant AK-HSDH exhibit 33% of identity at the amino acid level (Fig. 1). To characterize more deeply the regulatory domain of the plant enzyme, and in particular the sites where threonine potentially binds, we analyzed the predicted secondary structure of the subdomains. As shown in Fig. 1, each subdomain of the regulatory domain of AK-HSDH is predicted to exhibit a common loop-αhelix-loop-β strand-loop-β strand motif (loop-α-loop-β-loop-β motif). The primary sequence of the regulatory domain of TD does not exhibit homology with that of the regulatory domain of AK-HSDH. However, the structure of the E. coli TD crystallized in the absence of effector (17Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Xiai G. Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Chinchilla D. Eisenstein E. Structure. 1998; 6: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) clearly shows that the regulatory domain of TD is also composed by a pair of loop-α-loop-β-loop-β motifs as predicted in the AK-HSDH regulatory domain (Fig. 1). Thus, although the primary sequences of TD and AK-HSDH are different, the regulatory domains of these enzymes probably have more similar folds (Fig. 2). In our study of A. thaliana TD we showed that each subdomain of the regulatory domain of TD possesses an effector-binding site (18Wessel P. Graciet E. Douce R. Dumas R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15136-15143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, the amino acid residue located at the C-terminal extremity of the first βstrand (underlined in the motif) of each loop-α-loop-β-loop-β motif belongs to an effector-binding site (Figs. 1 and 2) (18Wessel P. Graciet E. Douce R. Dumas R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15136-15143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These amino acid residues are Tyr449 and Tyr543 in A. thaliana TD (Figs. 1 and 2) (18Wessel P. Graciet E. Douce R. Dumas R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15136-15143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because of the structural similarity between TD and AK-HSDH regulatory domains, the locations of the putative amino acids involved in the threonine-binding sites in AK-HSDH regulatory domain can thus be predicted. The putative amino acids selected for mutagenesis studies were chosen as follows. First, the amino acids selected must be conserved between subdomain 1 and subdomain 2 of the regulatory domain of AK-HSDH. Second, these amino acids must be located at the end of the first β strand of the loop-α-loop-β-loop-β motif found in each subdomain. We selected at this step three amino acids in each subdomain. These amino acids were Ile441, Ser442, and Gln443 for subdomain 1 and Ile522, Ser523, and Gln524 for subdomain 2. Third, the amino acids selected must be conserved between plant and bacterial threonine-sensitive AK-HSDH sequences. From this last selection, only Ile441and Gln443 for subdomain 1 and Ile522 and Gln524 for subdomain 2 are conserved between various plants and bacterial threonine-sensitive AK-HSDH. Therefore, these amino acids were selected for mutagenesis and replacement by alanine residues. Mutation of Ile or Gln of each subdomain leads to large modifications of the threonine sensitivity of the mutant enzymes. However, the strongest effects were observed for Gln443 and Gln524 mutants. As a consequence, we choose to report under “Results” only data concerning the mutagenesis of Gln443 and Gln524. Site-directed mutageneses were carried out on vector pET23/AK-HSDH (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and two mutants were constructed (pET23/AK-HSDH(Q443A) and pET23/AK-HSDH(Q524A)). Overproduction and purification to homogeneity were carried out for each mutant as described for the wild-type A. thaliana enzyme (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Solubility and yield of the two purified mutants were similar to those obtained for the wild-type AK-HSDH (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (not shown). For each mutant, aK 0.5 value for threonine was determined for the inhibition of AK and HSDH activities. Kinetic parameters for AK activity and both directions of HSDH reversible reaction were also determined. In the wild-type enzyme the inhibition of AK activity by threonine originates from an increase in the apparent K m values for ATP and aspartate (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At saturation of aspartate and ATP, threonine inhibits AK activity (Fig. 3 A) in a cooperative manner (K 0.5 = 500 μm;n H of 1.95). Inhibition is virtually 100% at saturation of threonine. Fig. 3 A shows that the mutation of the residue in subdomain 1 (Q443A) or in subdomain 2 (Q524A) leads to different effects on the inhibition pattern. AK activity of the mutant Q443A becomes completely insensitive to threonine inhibition (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, mutation of residue Gln524does not modify the K 0.5 value for inhibition of the activity of AK by threonine (K 0.5 = 368 μm) (Fig. 3 A). We demonstrated previously for the wild-type enzyme (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that the inhibition of HSDH activity by threonine in the reverse direction can be fitted by a hyperbolic equation (see Fig. 3 B). The concentration of threonine required to inhibit 50% of wild-type HSDH activity in the reverse direction is high (K 0.5 = 60 mm) compared with that required for 50% inhibition of wild-type AK activity (K 0.5 = 500 μm). As reported previously, the inhibition of wild-type HSDH activity in the reverse direction results from an increase in the apparentK m values for NADP+ and homoserine (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At saturation of threonine a maximum inhibition of 85% of the reverse reaction of HSDH activity is reached. Fig. 3 B shows that mutation of the residue in subdomain 1 (Q443A) or in subdomain 2 (Q524A) leads to similar effects on the inhibition of HSDH activity in the reverse direction by threonine. Indeed, theK 0.5 value for inhibition of the HSDH reverse reaction by threonine was increased by a factor of approximately 6 for both mutants Q443A (K 0.5 = 347 mm) and Q524A (K 0.5 = 335 mm) (Fig. 3 B). This contrasts with the results obtained when AK activity of these mutants was measured (only mutation Q443A led to modification of the inhibition pattern). Although theK 0.5 value for inhibition by threonine of the reverse reaction of HSDH does not correspond to a physiological value, mutations of Gln443 and Gln524 led in both cases to an alteration of the apparent affinity for threonine. These results clearly demonstrate the existence of two nonequivalent threonine-binding sites per monomer. To characterize the inhibition of HSDH activity in the forward direction, aspartate semialdehyde was produced using purified monofunctional aspartate kinase and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3 C shows that the inhibition of the forward reaction of wild-type HSDH activity by threonine can be fitted by a hyperbolic equation. A K 0.5 value of 12 mm was calculated. This value is 5-fold lower than that obtained for the reverse reaction (Fig. 3 C). As observed for HSDH activity in the reverse direction, threonine does not lead to a complete inhibition (80% of inhibition) of the forward reaction of the wild-type HSDH. Mutation of residues from subdomain 1 (Q443A) or subdomain 2 (Q524A) leads to a similar decrease in the apparent affinity for threonine. Indeed, the K 0.5 value for inhibition of HSDH activity in the forward direction was increased by a factor of approximately 10 for both mutants. A value of 119 mm was indeed calculated for the Q443A mutant and 92 mm for the Q524A mutant (Fig. 3 C). The same conclusions as those given above for the reverse direction can thus be drawn from the more delicate measurements of the reaction in the forward direction. The effects of the mutations on the kinetic parameters (V max,K m) were also determined for each mutant. The maximal velocity of AK and HSDH reactions was not modified for mutants Q443A and Q524A compared with that determined for the wild-type enzyme (see Tables I andII). The effects of the mutations on theK m values of substrates and cofactors of both AK and HSDH were also determined. As shown in Table I, mutation of Gln443 or Gln524 does not modify the kinetic parameters of the forward and reverse reactions of HSDH. By contrast and as shown in Table II, the kinetic properties of AK for aspartate and ATP were found to be slightly modified for mutants Q443A and Q524A compared with the wild-type enzyme. Indeed, the K mvalue for aspartate was increased by factors of 2 and 5 for mutants Q443A and Q524A, respectively. The K m value for ATP was decreased by a factor of approximately 5 for mutants Q443A and Q524A.Table IKinetic constants for HSDH activities of the wild-type and mutant AK-HSDH enzymesEnzymeReverse reactionForward reaction1-bThe mixture containing aspartate semialdehyde also contained NADPH.

Open table in a new tab We observed previously that elution of the wild-type AK-HSDH on Superdex S 200 (HiLoad 1.6 × 60) is modified on addition of threonine (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Indeed, when gel filtrations were carried out without threonine, wild-type AK-HSDH was eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 470 kDa (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) corresponding to an oligomer with a size larger than that of a tetramer (Fig. 4). However, in the presence of 5 mm threonine, the wild-type enzyme behaved as a tetramer with an apparent molecular mass of 320 kDa (16Paris S. Wessel P. Dumas R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine whether threonine had an effect on the quaternary structure of the AK-HSDH mutants, gel filtration experiments were carried out with the mutant enzymes in the presence or the absence of the effector. By contrast with the wild-type enzyme, elution of mutants Q443A and Q524A is not modified by the addition of threonine (5 mm) (Fig. 4). Indeed, the mutant enzymes were eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 470 kDa with or without threonine (Fig. 4). Previous binding experiments have demonstrated that each monomer of AK-HSDH is able to bind two threonine molecules (5Falcoz-Kelly F. Janin J. Saari J.C. Véron M. Truffa-Bachi P. Cohen G.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 28: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Bearer C.F. Neet K.E. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3512-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the location of the two binding sites was unknown. Our work allowed the identification of two amino acid residues (Gln443 and Gln524) belonging to two threonine-binding sites on each monomeric unit of threonine-sensitive AK-HSDH. Kinetic measurements of threonine inhibition on mutants Q443A and Q524A demonstrated clearly that these two sites are nonequivalent. Indeed, mutation of Gln443 changes the inhibition by threonine for both AK and HSDH activities, whereas mutation of Gln524 only alters the inhibition by threonine for HSDH activities. Kinetic experiments showed that mutation of Gln524 in subdomain 2 leads to an increase in theK 0.5 threonine value for inhibition of HSDH activities (forward and reverse directions). This result suggests therefore that binding of threonine on subdomain 2 is involved in the inhibition of HSDH activity (Fig. 5). Furthermore, because the mutation of subdomain 2 does not modify theK 0.5 threonine value for inhibition of AK activity, this result also indicates that binding of threonine on subdomain 2 controls exclusively HSDH activity. Analysis of kinetic experiments carried out on mutant-modified subdomain 1 is more complex. Indeed, modification of subdomain 1 (Q443A) completely suppressed the ability of threonine to inhibit AK (Fig. 3). This result suggests that binding of threonine on subdomain 1 is responsible for inhibition of AK activity (Fig. 5). Mutagenesis of subdomain 1 also induces a modification of the K 0.5 threonine for inhibition of HSDH activities. Because HSDH inhibition was shown to be dependent on threonine binding on subdomain 2, an interpretation of this result is that in addition to preventing threonine binding on subdomain 1, mutation of subdomain 1 also hinders the binding of threonine on subdomain 2. Thus, a coupling between subdomain 1 and subdomain 2 exists, but the communication is not reciprocal. From the observations of the effect of threonine on the kinetics of wild-type and mutant enzymes, one can propose that Gln443 is a high affinity binding site for threonine, whereas Gln524 is a low affinity binding site for the effector. Our results suggest therefore that interaction of threonine with the high affinity binding site Gln443 would lead to a loss of AK activity (Fig. 5). At the same time, threonine interaction with this high-affinity site would also induce a modification of the conformation of subdomain 2, allowing the second binding site with lower affinity (Gln524) to interact with a second threonine (Fig. 5). The binding of this second threonine would lead to the inhibition of HSDH activity (Fig. 5). Final validation of this model will be obtained with the determination of crystallographic structure of the wild-type and mutant enzymes with and without threonine. In a previous study that combined kinetic and binding experiments we showed that subdomain 1 of TD (containing Tyr449) is a high affinity binding site for isoleucine, whereas subdomain 2 (containing Tyr543) is a low-affinity binding site for isoleucine (18Wessel P. Graciet E. Douce R. Dumas R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15136-15143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that interaction of subdomain 1 of TD with a first isoleucine induces 1) a modification of conformation of the catalytic domain of TD leading to a slight activation of enzyme activity, and 2) a conformational modification of subdomain 2 leading to an enhancement of the affinity of subdomain 2 for isoleucine. Finally, isoleucine interaction with subdomain 2 induces conformational modifications of the catalytic domain leading to final inhibition of the enzyme (18Wessel P. Graciet E. Douce R. Dumas R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15136-15143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our present results on AK-HDSH mutants suggest therefore that the mechanism of control of AK-HSDH by threonine is similar to the mechanism of control of TD by isoleucine as described above. Indeed, for AK-HSDH and TD, mutation of subdomain 2 leads only to a decrease in the affinity of subdomain 2 for the effector, whereas mutation of subdomain 1 leads to a decrease in the affinity of both subdomains for the effector. Thus, one can propose that in the wild-type AK-HSDH and TD, interaction of a first effector on subdomain 1 induces conformational modification leading to or facilitating the binding of a second effector on subdomain 2 (Fig. 5). In parallel to the loss of sensitivity toward threonine inhibition, the apparent molecular mass of mutants Q443A and Q524A also becomes insensitive to threonine addition (at the concentration of threonine used in the experiment). This result shows that binding of threonine on the wild-type AK-HSDH induces conformational modifications that cannot occur in the mutant enzymes. Because the Q524A mutant still binds threonine on subdomain 1 (Gln443), one can propose that binding of threonine in subdomain 2 is responsible for the shift in the apparent molecular weight observed when wild-type enzyme is gel-filtered in the presence of threonine. Further work is required to characterize the effect of threonine binding on the quaternary structure of the enzyme. As described above, the amino acid residues located between the C-terminal extremity of the first β strand and the last loop of the loop-α-loop-β-loop-β motif of each subdomain of AK-HSDH belong to an effector-binding site. Additional mutations (I441A and I522A) carried out in the end of the first β strand of each subdomain of AK-HSDH disclose that Ile441 and Ile522 also belong to the two effector-binding sites (results not shown). As observed for mutant Q443A, mutation of Ile442 (and not Ile522) by alanine leads to a loss of threonine sensitivity for the AK activity (results not shown). In agreement with the behavior of the mutants Q443A and Q524A, mutation of Ile442 and Ile522 by alanine leads to a decrease of threonine sensitivity for inhibition of HSDH activities (results not shown). Additional mutations and crystallographic determination of the structure in the presence of the effector will be required to define accurately all the amino acid residues conferring the specificity of the effector-binding site of each subdomain. A main issue of the characterization and comparison of the different mechanisms of control of allosteric enzymes is to determine whether general mechanisms can be uncovered and therefore used to predict function from the analysis of the amino acid sequences. To determine whether the loop-α-loop-β-loop-β motif found in AK-HSDH and TD is present in other allosteric proteins, homology search was carried out using the Pfam protein families data base (25Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The search showed that this motif is annotated as an “ACT domain.” Interestingly and as described recently (26Chipman D.M. Shaanan B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), this motif can be found in a great many allosteric proteins involved in amino acid or purine biosynthesis. As shown in the Pfam protein families data base (25Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and as reported recently (26Chipman D.M. Shaanan B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the ACT domain can be found in one copy or in duplicate (in the case of AK-HSDH or TD). As demonstrated by the work carried out on TD (18Wessel P. Graciet E. Douce R. Dumas R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15136-15143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and AK-HSDH (this article) the existence of a pair of ACT domains would lead to the creation of two nonequivalent binding sites allowing complex regulatory patterns of various protein activities.

PI3Ks are divided in three major classes according to substrate specificity, amino acid sequence, and homology of their lipid kinase domains. Class IA PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), PtdIns 4-phosphate, and PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate and are active as heterodimers consisting of regulatory and catalytic subunits. Activation of class 1A PI3K occurs by receptor-tyrosine kinases like the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor either by direct binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated pYMXM and pYXXM motifs of the IGF-1 receptor β-chain and insulin receptor substrates (IRS) (1Fruman D.A.

There are multiple regulatory and catalytic subunits of class 1A PI3K. These regulatory subunits are derived from three different genes and can be classified according to their molecular structure. The full-length regulatory subunits are derived from distinct genes, thePik3r1 (p85α) and Pikr2 (p85β) genes and are comprised of an NH2-terminal SH3 domain and a BCR homology region flanked by two proline-rich sites (1Fruman D.A.

Recent studies indicate a complex regulation of PI3K activity by regulatory isoforms. In the classical model, p85α serves as an adaptor and activator of heterodimeric PI3K holoenzyme by binding to phosphorylated receptor-tyrosine kinases and IRS proteins (1Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 2Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin.

Recently, we have shown that monomeric regulatory subunits not associated with catalytic subunits may exist and thus act as inhibitors of PI3K activation (10Ueki K. Algenstaedt P. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8035-8046Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Ueki K. Fruman D.A. Brachmann S.M. Tseng Y.H. Cantley L.C. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, a reduction of the amount of either p85α or p85β may result in increased activation of PI3K. The targeted deletion of full-length p85α with preserved expression of p50α and p55α results in increased insulin sensitivity (12Terauchi Y. Tsuji Y. Satoh S. Minoura H. Murakami K. Okuno A.

A similar phenotype of increased insulin sensitivity is also observed in mice lacking p85β (13Ueki K. Yballe C.M. Brachmann S.M. Vicent D. Watt J.M. Kahn C.R. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Likewise, mice with a heterozygous-targeted deletion of all three isoforms of the Pik3r1 gene p85α, p55α, and p50α exhibit improved insulin signaling and protection from the development of diabetes (14Mauvais-Jarvis F.

These results suggest an inhibitory action of PI3K regulatory subunits upon PI3K activation, which may be explained by formation of p85α monomers, allosteric inhibition of catalytic isoforms by regulatory subunits, and tyrosine phosphorylation of p85α at tyrosine 688 (16Yu J.

In summary, current models of PI3K activation suggest a dual role for p85α as a positive and negative regulator of p85α/p110α heterodimeric PI3K depending upon the relation of regulatory and catalytic isoforms in a given cell type. These results prompted us to examine signaling by IGF-1 in embryonal stem (ES) cells with a heterozygous and homozygous deletion in the Pik3r1 gene coding for p85α, p55α, and p50α. We characterized ES cells as a model of low expression of p85α compared with catalytic subunits resulting in the virtual absence of monomeric regulatory isoforms. Loss of p85α in ES cells induced increased PI3K activation associated with p85β, increased apoptosis and alterations in cell cycle, but no defects in differentiation. However, when ES cells with a loss of p85α were differentiated, they partially lost their ability for compensatory signaling at the level of PI3K.

Reagents for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA), cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany), and all other chemicals were from Sigma. ES cells lines were grown as previously described (19Dani C. Smith A.G. Dessolini S. Leroy P. Staccini L. Villageois P. Darimont C. Ailhaud G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, non-essential amino acids, 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified (5% CO2, 95% air) atmosphere. Genotypes of wild type (+/+), heterozygous knockout (+/−), and homozygous knockout (−/−) ES cells were verified by PCR with primers for the wild type and mutated alleles (15Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L. Yu J.F. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 103 in 96-well plates, grown for 24 h in regular medium, washed once with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and subsequently starved for 24 h. They were then stimulated with IGF-1 for 24 h in DMEM medium without serum. During the last 6 h of stimulation, 20 μl of a BrdUrd solution was added, and the ELISA (20Huong P.L. Kolk A.H. Eggelte T.A. Verstijnen C.P. Gilis H. Hendriks J.T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 140: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was performed as suggested by the manufacturer. To determine the frequency of apoptosis, ES cells were grown for 48 h in 24-well plates, starved for 24 h, and then stimulated for 24 h. Cells were lysed, DNA was precipitated, and 10 μg of DNA were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. 10 μg of total RNA was separated in a 1.5% denaturing agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by capillary transfer. Northern blots were hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probes as previously described (21Kerouz N.J. Hörsch D. Pons S. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 3164-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed in 2× saline sodium citrate (SSC), 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2× 20 min at room temperature, and then in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2× 10 min at 55 °C. Blots were exposed overnight with intensifier screens. The generation of cDNA probes for PI3K regulatory and catalytic isoforms was as described previously (9Hörsch D. und Kahn C.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 415: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Kerouz N.J. Hörsch D. Pons S. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 3164-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). ES cells were grown to 60% confluence, washed once with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with IGF-1 for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were gently trypsinized and fixed in 70% ethanol for 2 h and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline. DNA was stained by the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μg/ml DNase-free RNase, and 20 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cell cycle detection was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACS SCAN cell counter at 488-nm wavelength excitation and 600-nm detection. Data were analyzed with Cell Quest and ModFitLT V2.0 software. ES cells were grown to 80% confluence, trypsinized, and subsequently grown in normal DMEM with the addition of LIF in bacterial grade dishes with gentle shaking for 48 to achieve the formation of aggregates termed embryoid bodies. Embryoid bodies were then replanted onto cell culture dishes and cultivated in DMEM without LIF and the addition of 2 nm triiodothyronine and 85 nm insulin as previously described (19Dani C. Smith A.G. Dessolini S. Leroy P. Staccini L. Villageois P. Darimont C. Ailhaud G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 14 days, cells were harvested or stained with oil red for the detection of adipocytes. ES cells were grown for 48 h in normal medium in 6-well plates until they reached 60–80% confluency. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, transfected with luciferase reporter gene (pFR-Luc), and either Elk1 (pFA-2-Elk1) or CREB (pFA2-CREB) transactivator domains (all from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by lipid-based transfection (Pfx-6) for 8 h in DMEM without serum. Subsequently, cells were grown in normal DMEM and then stimulated for 16 h in DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 10 nm IGF-1. Cells were lysed in luciferase assay buffer (Stratagene), and luciferase activity was determined (22Trümper A. Trümper K. Trusheim H. Arnold R. Göke B. Hörsch D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). ES cells were starved for 12 h and were then equilibrated for another 12 h in indicated glucose concentrations. One hour prior to stimulation, the stimulation medium was changed. Cells were lysed after stimulation in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.5 mg/ml benzamidine, and 34 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated for 15 s, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, 5 μg of antibodies and 40 μl of a 50% protein G-agarose slurry were added to 500–1000 μg of proteins for 12 h. The washed immunoprecipitates or 50–100 μg of protein lysate were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, Western-transferred on nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted as previously described (21Kerouz N.J. Hörsch D. Pons S. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 3164-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified using Gelscan 3D software (BioSciTec, Marburg, Germany; Ref.22Trümper A. Trümper K. Trusheim H. Arnold R. Göke B.

Immune complexes were incubated in a 55-μl reaction mixture containing 440 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 μg of phosphatidylinositol for 20 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition 20 μl of 8 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3/methanol (1:1). The organic phase was removed by centrifugation and applied to silica gel thin layer chromatography plates, developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The band representing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was quantified as described (21Kerouz N.J. Hörsch D. Pons S. Kahn C.R. J. Clin.

The ES cells were then serum-starved for 12 h and subsequently subjected to various assays. ES cells contain an easily detectable amount of p85α by immunoblotting in wild type (+/+) cells, and this was reduced by 50% in heterozygous knockout (+/−) cells and was undetectable in homozygous knockout (−/−) ES cells (Fig. 1 A). The alternatively spliced isoforms p55α and p50α were not detected in wild type and the heterozygous or homozygous p85α knockout ES cells (Fig. 1 A). IRS-1, IRS-2, PI3K regulatory subunit p85β (data not shown), all p110 catalytic isoforms p110α, p110β, and p110γ (p110pan; Fig. 1 B), and p110β (data not shown) demonstrated no apparent alterations in expression levels between the different cell lines as did CREB, MAPKs p42/p44, PKB, GSK-3, cdc42, and Rb (data not shown). Northern blotting with a cDNA probe specific for mouse p85β (9Hörsch D. und Kahn C.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 415: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) revealed a slight decrease of p85β transcripts in (−/−) cells (Fig. 1 C). The stoichiometric balance of regulatory and catalytic subunits of PI3K influences signaling in a given cell type (10Ueki K. Algenstaedt P. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8035-8046Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Ueki K. Fruman D.A. Brachmann S.M. Tseng Y.H. Cantley L.C. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the stoichiometry of regulatory and catalytic isoforms in ES cells stimulated with IGF-1 by serial immunoprecipitations with antibodies to p85α and p110α/β. A serial immunoprecipitation of ES cell lysates with antibodies to p85α resulted in the almost complete depletion of p85α by the third immunoprecipitation round in wild type cells (Fig. 1 D), which was accompanied by a concomitant depletion of phosphorylated IRS isoforms (data not shown). Similar results were obtained by serial immunoprecipitations using a mixture of p110α and p110β antibodies depleting completely p85α (Fig. 1 E) and phosphorylated IRS proteins (not shown). In contrast, serial immunoprecipitation of p110 was incomplete in the third round (Fig. 1 F), suggesting that levels of p110α and p110β exceed the level of p85α, which is low in ES cells with virtual no expression of monomeric p85α and no residual association of p85α with IRS proteins. Activation of PI3K by IGF-1 occurs following phosphorylation of IRS isoforms and association of the PI3K regulatory isoforms with phosphotyrosines residues. We performed immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine antibodies after immunoprecipitation with antibodies for pY, IRS-1, and IRS-2. No alterations were detected in phosphorylated IRS isoforms following stimulation with IGF-1 (Fig. 2 A). As expected, in ES cells with a reduction or deletion of p85α, binding of phosphorylated IRS proteins to p85α (Fig. 2 B), and also p110α/β catalytic isoforms was reduced (data not shown). These results indicated diminished binding of PI3K heterodimer to phosphorylated IRS proteins in ES cells with a deletion in the Pik3r1 gene. To verify these results, we examined the binding of p85α to IRS proteins and p110 catalytic isoforms by immunoprecipitations with specific antibodies followed by anti-p85α immunoblots (Fig. 2 C). In analogy to the previous experiments, we found that a deletion of p85α resulted in reduced binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, IRS-1, IRS-2, p110α, and p110β (Fig. 2 C). These results indicated that phosphorylation of IRS proteins by IGF-1 was unaltered in the different cell lines. However, a reduction in the amount or p85α by heterozygous and homozygous deletion of the Pik3r1gene resulted in reduced binding of regulatory and catalytic subunits to phosphorylated IRS isoforms. To directly examine the effects of a deletion of the Pik3r1gene upon PI3K activation by IGF-1, lipid kinase activity associated with pY, IRS proteins, and the various regulatory and catalytic subunits of PI3K was determined. Surprisingly, in all cell lines, basal and IGF-1-stimulated PI3K activity associated with pY, IRS-1, and IRS-2 was not different between wild type, +/− and −/− cell lines (Fig. 3, A–C) while IGF-1 failed to stimulate PI3K activity associated with Gab-1 in all cells (Fig. 3 D). As expected, PI3K activity associated with p85α was largely reduced in −/− cells, but a small signal persisted possibly due to minor cross reaction of the p85α antibody with p85β (Fig. 3 E). ES cell with a heterozygous deletion in thePik3r1 gene showed only a modest reduction in PI3K activity associated with p85α. Conversely, PI3K activity associated with the closely related p85β was up-regulated in +/− and −/− cells (Fig. 3 F). There were no alterations in lipid kinase activity associated with catalytic subunits p110α and p110β (Fig. 3,G and H). Thus, increased p85β-associated PI3K activity appears to compensate for the deletion of the p85α at the level of PI3K. Phosphorylated PtdIns generated by PI3K have been shown to act as second messengers upon a number of downstream signaling molecules. To elucidate whether a disruption in the Pik3r1gene induced alterations in downstream signaling by PI3K, phosphorylation of PKB, cdc42, GSK-3, and the transcription factor CREB was examined. Although p85β appeared to compensate for deletion of p85α at the level of PI3-K, phosphorylation of PKB in response to IGF-1 stimulation in +/− and −/− ES cells was reduced at serine 473 and threonine 308 corresponding to activation of the serine-threonine kinase (24Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) compared with wild type ES cells (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating that p85β was less efficient in stimulating these targets than p85α. In contrast to the phosphorylation pattern of PKB, phosphorylation of its downstream target GSK3α/β by IGF-1 was comparable in all cell types (Fig. 4 C). Another target of PKB is the transcription factor CREB, which is activated by phosphorylation at serine 133. Interestingly, both basal and IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylation of CREB was increased in +/− and −/− cells (Fig. 4 E). A similar pattern of elevated phosphorylation and activation in knockout cells was also observed at the level of MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 4 D). The increased activation of CREB and MAP kinases was also elucidated with an increased activation of CREB and Elk-1 in +/− and −/− cells by a luciferase-based transactivation system (Fig. 4 G). These results indicate a differential dependence of downstream targets of PI3K by a deletion in the Pik3r1 gene. No difference in expression (Fig. 4 F) and phosphorylation of PTEN at serine 308/threonine 382/threonine 383 (data not shown) was observed in all three cell types implying that PTEN is not involved in compensatory signaling in cells with a deletion in the Pik3r1 gene. Since one of the major functions of PI3K is the regulation of cellular growth and protection from apoptosis, we examined proliferation rate, frequency of apoptosis, and regulation of cell cycle in ES cells with a deletion in the Pik3r1 gene. The deletion of the p85α gene caused a reduction in basal and IGF-1-stimulated rate of DNA synthesis in p85α +/− and −/− cells (Fig. 5 A). Conversely, we observed elevated frequency of apoptosis in p85α +/− und −/− ES cells, demonstrated by increased DNA laddering (Fig. 5 B) and elevated cleavage of PARP (Fig. 5 C). Analysis of basal and IGF-1-stimulated ES cells revealed that these alterations were due to complex changes in cell cycle regulation in the different cell lines. Non-stimulated wild type ES cells are rapidly dividing with ∼45% in S-phase. This was increased in +/− cells to 54% and reduced to 39% in −/− cells. In wild type ES"
https://openalex.org/W2024295712,"Activation of prothrombin, as catalyzed by the prothrombinase complex (factor Xa, enzyme; factor Va and phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing membranes, cofactors), involves production and subsequent proteolysis of two possible intermediates, meizothrombin (MzIIa) and prethrombin 2 plus fragment 1.2 (Pre2 & F1.2).V max, K m, orV max/K m for all four proteolytic steps was determined as a function of membrane-phospholipid concentration. Proteolysis was monitored using a fluorescent thrombin inhibitor, a chromogenic substrate, and SDS-PAGE. The kinetic constants for the conversion of MzIIa and Pre2 & F1.2 to thrombin were determined directly. Pre2 & F1.2 conversion was linear in substrate concentration up to 4 μm, whereas MzIIa proteolysis was saturable. First order rate constants for formation of MzIIa and Pre2 & F1.2 could not be determined directly and were determined from global fitting of the data to a parallel, sequential model, each step of which was treated by the Michaelis-Menten formalism. The rate of direct conversion to thrombin without release of intermediates from the membrane-Va-Xa complex (i.e.“channeling”) also was adjusted because both the membranes and factor Va have been shown to cause channeling.k cat, K m, ork cat/K m values were reported for one lipid concentration, for which all Xa was likely incorporated into a Xa-Va complex on a PS membrane. Comparing previous results, which were obtained either with factor Va (Boskovic, D. S., Bajzar, L. S., and Nesheim, M. E. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 28686–28693) or with membranes individually (Wu, J. R., Zhou, C., Majumder, R., Powers, D. D., Weinreb, G., and Lentz, B. R. (2002)Biochemistry 41, 935–949), with results presented here we conclude that both factor Va and PS-containing membranes induce similar rate increases and pathway changes. Moreover, we have determined: 1) factor Va has the greatest effect in enhancing rates of individual proteolytic events; 2) PS-containing membranes have the greatest role in increasing the preference for the MzIIa versus Pre2 pathway; and 3) PS membranes cause ∼50% of the substrate to be activated via channeling at 50 μm membrane concentration, but factor Vaextends the range of efficient channeling to much lower or higher membrane concentrations."

Previously, we cloned two MaxiK channel isoforms, named rbslo1 and rbslo2, from rabbit renal cells. rbslo1 has a 58-amino acid insertion after the S8 hydrophobic domain, whereas rbslo2 is truncated and cannot be activated. Here we use the sequence differences between the two variants to examine their plasma membrane processing. Plasma membrane localization of rbslo1 and 2 expressed in HEK293 cells was assayed by electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and biochemistry studies. Consistent with its functional silence, rbslo2 localized primarily within the cytoplasm, presumably in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi region. Coexpression with MaxiK β subunits did not alter the cellular localization of either rbslo1 or rbslo2. When rbslo1 and 2 are cotransfected in non-polarized cells, they colocalized primarily within the cell with only rbslo1 detected at the plasma membrane. When transfected into polarized, medullary-thick ascending limb (mTAL) cells, rbslo1 is expressed at the apical membrane whereas the majority of rbslo2 localized throughout the cytoplasm.

MaxiK channels play a fundamental role in many physiological processes, including action potential repolarization, modulation of calcium signals, hormone release, and regulation of vascular tone (28Robitaille R. Charlton M.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 297-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lancaster B. Nicoll R.A. Perkel D.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nelson M.T.

MaxiK channels from different cell types vary in their calcium sensitivity, unitary conductance, and gating kinetics (5Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The interaction of the MaxiK α-subunit with the modulatory β-subunits or other accessory proteins partially explains their overall functional diversity. More importantly, the function variation of MaxiK channels comes from the alternative splicing of its α-subunit (17Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 22Toro L. Wallner M. Meera P. Tanaka Y. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 112-117PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lai G.J. McCobb D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7722-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). So far, ten splice sites have been reported with most of them localized in the intracellular C terminus. The renal MaxiK channel is distributed in glomeruli, thin limbs of Henle's loop, cortical and medullary ascending limbs of Henle's loop, cortical collecting tubules, and outer and inner medullary collecting ducts (9Morita T. Hanaoka K. Morales M.M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F615-F624PubMed Google Scholar). Renal MaxiK channels function in cell volume regulation and flow-mediated K+ secretion (12Woda C.B. Bragin A. Kleyman T.R. Satlin L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F786-F793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the cloning of two isoforms of the MaxiK channel α-subunit from a rabbit medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) cell line (9Morita T. Hanaoka K. Morales M.M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F615-F624PubMed Google Scholar). The longer one, rbslo1 (NCBI accession number AF201702), is highly homologous to MaxiK channels from other species such as mslo, hslo, and cslo and has an additional 58-amino acid (aa) exon insert between the S8 and S9 regions. The other isoform, rbslo2, is truncated at position Gly781 with a unique 15-aa sequence appended at the end (see Fig. 1 below). Using electrophysiological techniques, we have shown that rbslo1 functions in a voltage- and Ca2+-dependent way, whereas rbslo2 cannot be activated at all. The objectives of the present study were to determine at the protein level why rbslo2 is functionally silent. To this end we examined the electrophysiology, assembly, and intracellular localization of rbslo1, rbslo2, and several deletion mutants in cultured mammalian cell lines. Using whole cell current recordings, confocal microscopy, and cell surface biotinylation, we report here that the cytoplasmic tail present in rbslo1 but missing in rbslo2 is critically involved in apical cell membrane expression of the MaxiK channel in renal cells. The MaxiK channel has seven transmembrane domains (S0–S6, Fig. 1) with an extracellular N terminus and a large cytoplasmic tail. The wild type rbslo1 and rbslo2 cDNAs, i.e. wt-rbslo1 and wt-rbslo2 (see Fig. 1), were prepared as described before (9Morita T. Hanaoka K. Morales M.M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F615-F624PubMed Google Scholar). All the myc-tagged constructs were created by PCR amplification using the wild type rbslo1 or 2 as the template. The PCR primers were synthesized to flank the desired DNA sequence with a BamHI (for forward primer) orSalI (for reverse primer) enzyme digestion site at the end. The PCR products were purified, double-digested by restriction enzymesBamHI and SalI, and ligated into pCMV-TAG3 (Stratagene) vector. To make the GFP-tagged rbslo2 construct, the coding region of wt-rbslo2 was isolated by double digestion using restriction enzymes HindIII and XbaI. The fragment was subcloned into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) vector. All the rbslo1 and 2 constructs were sequenced to verify that the correct insert and the coding sequences were in-frame with the tag. All vectors contained the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter to obtain better transfection rates and higher expression level in mammalian cells. The wt-rbslo1 was investigated by a rabbit polyclonal antibody against its C terminus. For other experiments, we chose to add myc or GFP tag in-frame at the N terminus of the signal sequence of rbslo1 and 2. The fusion proteins were investigated by using antibodies against the corresponding tag peptide. To determine whether the 58-aa insertion in rbslo1 and the unique C terminus of 15 aa in rbslo2 may have some function to the channel's property, two truncated DNA constructs designated myc-rbslo1-Del and myc-rbslo2-Del were generated from their corresponding DNA myc-rbslo1 and myc-rbslo2, respectively. Both of the deletion constructs stop at a Gly residue (Gly839 in wt-rbslo1 or Gly781 in wt-rbslo2, respectively). The MaxiK β3 and β4 subunits were cloned from human kidney library (Clontech) using PCR technique according to their published sequences (NCBI accession numbers AF170916 and AF160967 for β3 and β4, respectively). The PCR products were then subcloned into pEGFP-C3 vector and sequenced as described above. Both HEK293 and mTAL cells were grown in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and passaged twice weekly through exposure to 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA. For transfection, HEK293 cells were transferred to poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) when 90% confluent. For electrophysiology, GFP plasmid was cotransfected with either rbslo1 or 2 DNA. To increase the transfection rates in polarized mTAL cells, the DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture was added immediately after the cells were seeded on the 12-mm Transwell (0.4-μm pore size, Corning Inc.). Remaining transfection steps were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty eight to seventy two hours after transfection, the cells were used for electrophysiological studies or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and, if desired, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 3 min for immunofluorescent experiments. Currents were measured using a conventional tight seal whole cell recording at room temperature. The GFP plasmid was used to identify green fluorescent cells, which were likely cotransfected with the rbslo1 or 2 constructs, using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted fluorescence microscope intrinsic to the current recording system. GFP-positive cells were superfused with an extracellular solution containing (in mm): 135 sodium aspartate, 10 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 0.1 niflumic acid, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with Tris). Aspartate-rich solution and niflumic acid were used to prevent the activation of endogenous currents. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 135 potassium aspartate, 15 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with Tris). Extracellular solution containing 10 or 30 μm ionomycin was puff-applied using a nearby pipette of 30- to 35-μm diameter. pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments) was used to sample and analyze data. The access conductance was monitored in the trace of capacitate surge. To minimize the voltage errors due to the lower access conductance, results that showed the amplitude of the current above 1 nA were obtained from the experiments showing the access conductance over 70 nanosiemens. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were obtained at 100 ms of each voltage step from a holding potential of −80 mV. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against C terminus of rbslo1 was from Alomone Laboratories; mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) for myc and rabbit polyclonal antibody for ZO-1 were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; antibody for GFP (rabbit) was from Clontech; antibody for CD4 (mouse) was from Calbiochem; chicken anti-myc antibody was from Aves Laboratories Inc.; mouse anti-KDEL antibody was from StressGen; mouse anti-γ-adaptin antibody was from Transduction; mouse anti-mannose 6-phosphate receptor antibody was from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. The lowest concentration of antibody giving the highest signal was used in these studies. In all experiments, negative controls were performed by either: 1) transfecting cells with DNA vectors or no DNA or 2) pre-adsorbing each antibody with the corresponding antigenic peptide or both as appropriate. For double-labeling experiments, single-stained specimens were examined under the other fluorescent channel to assure minimized bleed-through. Moreover, the intensity of the two dyes in double-stained specimens was balanced to reduce artifacts. No antibodies from the same species were used in any of the double-stained specimens. For immunostaining, the fixed cells were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h, washed with PBS three times, and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3 fluorescent dye (Sigma) for 1 h. After staining, the coverslips (for HEK293) or Transwells (for mTAL) were washed in PBS and mounted using Prolong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Cells transiently transfected with DNA constructs encoding rbslo1 or rbslo2 fusion proteins were lysed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1 tablet per 50-ml solution). The lysates were spun at 6000 ×g for 5 min to pellet the insoluble material, and the proteins from supernatant were quantified using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit. After mixing in Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) and incubating at 37 °C for 15 min, the protein sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The probing with specific antibodies and subsequent detection with ECL plus system (Amersham Biosciences) was performed according to standard procedure as described previously (33Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R., Li, M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The fluorescence label was examined with UltraView confocal imaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Images were generated using the manufacturer's software suite. Contrast and brightness settings were chosen to ensure that all pixels were within the linear range. To obtain three-dimensional images of the cell, each XY plane of the sample with a depth of 0.4 μm in Z direction was scanned by the confocal laser, and the picture serials along the Z-axis were combined, reconstructed, and presented as XZ and YZ cross-section images using the Volocity software package (Improvision Ltd.) Images were prepared for publication with Adobe Photoshop. HEK293 cells were grown on six-well plates for 48–72 h after DNA transfection. Cell surface biotinylation was carried out by overlaying 1.0 ml of Sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) (1.0 mg/ml in PBS buffer) on the cells. The sample was incubated for 45 min on ice with gentle shaking. Cold PBS buffer (1 volume, 1.0 ml) containing 100 mm glycine was then added to stop the reaction. After an additional 20-min incubation, the cells were collected and lysed as described above. The biotinylated proteins from the cell surface were recovered from lysates by incubation with 100 μl of immobilized streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce). Bound proteins were eluted from the beads in Laemmli buffer, and the unbound samples were also saved. All the protein samples were quantified and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the wt-rbslo1 and GFP plasmid. Outward currents were observed in cells selected for positive GFP expression (Fig. 2 A). These outward currents were also time-dependent. Five seconds after treatment of the same cell with ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore, outward currents were observed at lower voltage steps (Fig. 2, A andB). A prolonged treatment with ionomycin (> 15 s) resulted in the activation of an inward current at −100 mV and an almost linear I-V relation (data not shown) with a reversal potential of −70 mV, suggesting the high sensitivity of wt-rbslo1 channel to Ca2+ (34Hanaoka K. Wright J.M. Cheglakov I.B. Morita T. Guggino W.B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed in eight of eight cells tested. These features in cells expressing wt-rbslo1 are similar to previous measurements in rbslo1-expressing Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells (9Morita T. Hanaoka K. Morales M.M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F615-F624PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, cells expressing GFP only did not show any similar current activity (five cells, data not shown). When wt-rbslo1 was tagged with myc at the N terminus (myc-rbslo1) and cotransfected with GFP into HEK293 cells, current activities similar to those with wt-rbslo1 were observed in 9 cells tested (Fig. 2,E and F). These data suggested that the myc tag at the N terminus does not affect the channel function of rbslo1. A G839X truncation mutant, myc-rbslo1-Del, which lacks the cytoplasmic tail of rbslo1, did not generate any time-, voltage-, and Ca2+-dependent currents when coexpressed with GFP (Fig. 2, G and H). In contrast to wt-rbslo1 channel, when cells were transfected with wt-rbslo2, no time-, voltage-, and Ca2+-dependent current activities were observed (10 cells tested, Fig. 2, C and D). Similar results were obtained using myc-rbslo2 (five cells tested, Fig. 2,I and J), GFP-rbslo2 (eight cells tested, data not shown), or the G781X mutant, myc-rbslo2-Del (four cells tested, data not shown), which lacks the C-terminal unique tail of 15 aa in rbslo2. These data suggest the cytoplasmic tail of the rbslo1 is essential for the generation of plasma membrane currents. Like the other potassium channels, functional MaxiK channels formed by the tetramerization of monomers (35Coetzee W.A. Amarillo Y. Chiu J. Chow A. Lau D. McCormack T. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Ozaita A.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether both rbslo1 and 2 exist as oligomers using non-reduced electrophoresis and immunoblotting techniques. HEK293 cell lysates containing the exogenously expressed rbslo1 or 2 proteins were pretreated with non-mercaptoethanol containing Laemmli buffer. An immunoblot with mouse anti-myc antibody (Fig. 3 A) shows that the monomer, as well as various oligomers, were present in all samples,i.e. myc-rbslo1, myc-rbslo1-Del, myc-rbslo2, and myc-rbslo2-Del. The stoichiometry of the oligomers was initially determined by comparing the apparent molecular weight of each band to its respective theoretical value. For example, bands labeled withone to four stars for myc-slo1 have calculated apparent molecular masses of about 146, 262, 314, and 431 kDa, respectively. They were designated monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer, respectively. Because membrane and soluble proteins have different hydrodynamic properties, soluble molecular weight markers may not provide an accurate estimate of the molecular mass of a hydrophobic protein (37Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further tested our proposed multimeric state of each band by plotting the relative migration (Rf) of each band against the putative number of subunits they represent (Fig. 3 B). The linear relationship in each of the four plots indicates that the relative mobility of each band corresponds to its assigned subunit stoichiometry, suggesting that rbslo1 and 2 monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer existed (38Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 39Raab-Graham K.F. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19699-19707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results in Fig. 3indicate that both rbslo1 and 2 proteins retain the ability to assemble as oligomers and that the cytoplasmic tail of rbslo1 is not necessary for rbslo1 or 2 channel assembly. To see if the lack of rbslo2 channel currents was due to its misdistribution in the cell, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with various rbslo1 or 2 constructs. After 48 h, the cells were examined under indirect immunofluorescent confocal microscopy using rabbit polyclonal anti-rbslo1 antibody for wt-rbslo1 and mouse monoclonal anti-myc antibody for myc-rbslo1 (Fig. 4, A and B). Both wt-rbslo1 and myc-rbslo1 displayed a clear cell surface distribution. Therefore, as suggested by our electrophysiological studies, rbslo1 protein traffics to the cell surface and the N terminus myc-tag does not interfere with the localization of the channel proteins. We also compared the effects of myc and GFP tags by cotransfecting both myc-rbslo2 and GFP-rbslo2 into the HEK293 cells (Fig. 4,C–E). We found that when coexpressed in one cell, myc-rbslo2 (C, Cy3-labeled secondary antibody) and GFP-rbslo2 (D) proteins have the same distribution as indicated by the yellow in the merged image(E). Thus neither N-terminal myc nor GFP tag disturbs the characteristics of rbslo channels. Fig. 4 suggests that the majority of rbslo2 is localized inside the cell. To see if some of the rbslo2 proteins are able to reach the cell surface, we compared the expression of rbslo2 constructs with the endogenous or transfected cell membrane markers ZO-1 (40Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H. Ismailov I.I. Guggino W.B. Langford G.M. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21759-21768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and CD4 (41Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), respectively. Fig. 5 shows either membrane marker, ZO-1 (A) or CD4 (D), in red and rbslo2 ingreen (B and E). A merge of the images (C and F) shows no regions of overlap (yellow) at the cell surface, indicating that rbslo2 was almost exclusively confined to the cytoplasmic region of the cell. In a separate experiment to verify the surface presentation of rbslo1 and rbslo2 proteins, we conducted cell surface biotinylation experiments (Fig. 6). The data showed that a large amount of rbslo1 proteins was biotinylated, indicating its strong cell surface expression. On the contrary, for rbslo2, only a negligible amount of the protein was biotinylated. The Western blotting results for rbslo2 were similar to GFP, a control protein that does not express at the cell surface. Taken together with our immunofluorescent data, these results confirm that the majority of rbslo1, but not rbslo2, is delivered to the cell surface region. To further pursue the intracellular localization of rbslo1 and 2 proteins, we double-labeled rbslo1- or rbslo2-expressing cells with antibodies against channel proteins and markers of intracellular organelles. Both rbslo1 and 2 appear (Fig. 7, Aand D, respectively) in green, and the ER, as detected by an anti-KDEL antibody, appears in red. Regions of overlap appear in yellow. Whereas rbslo1 is expressed primarily at the plasma membrane, some rbslo1 did colocalize with the ER marker. In contrast, rbslo2 resides predominately in the ER region. Using the anti-γ-adaptin antibody (Cy3-labeled secondary) to label the Golgi apparatus, it can be seen that only rbslo2 colocalized with Golgi marker, whereas the colocalization signal of rbslo1 and Golgi marker was very weak (Fig. 7, B and E). Endosomal compartments were labeled by anti-mannose 6-phosphate receptor antibody (Fig. 7, C and F). Only a negligible amount of rbslo1 or rbslo2 localized within the endosomal compartments of the cell. Importantly, both myc-rbslo1-Del and myc-rbslo2-Del have intracellular ER and Golgi localization similar as rbslo2, again pointing out the role of the C-terminal domain in the trafficking of rbslo1 (Fig. 7, G–L). To study whether the MaxiK β subunits play a role in the intracellular trafficking of rbslo1 and 2, we cotransfected either rbslo1 or rbslo2 with the MaxiK β3 or β4 subunit (Fig. 8). In the presence of the β subunit in HEK293 cells, rbslo1 was still located at the cell surface (Fig. 8, A–C and G–I), whereas rbslo2 remained mostly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8, D–F and J–L). Comparing these results with those in Figs. 5 and 7, it can be seen that the subcellular distribution of rbslo2 did not change after coexpression with MaxiK β subunits. To study the possible effect of rbslo1 on the intracellular trafficking of rbslo2, we cotransfected both rbslo1 and 2 into HEK293 cells. When coexpressed, rbslo1 and 2 colocalized most intensely within the c"

Three of the five human MARs and the single mouse MAR recruit heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP-A1) in vivo during transcriptional up-regulation of the major histocompatibility complex class II genes. The timing of this recruitment correlates with a rise in mature TAP1 mRNA. Two of the human MARs bind hnRNP-A1 in vitro directly within a 35-bp sequence that shows over 90% similarity to certain Alu repeat sequences.

Matrix attachment regions (MARs) 1The abbreviations used are: MARs, matrix attachment regions; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MRS, the matrix recognition signature; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; RT, reverse transcriptase; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HREs, hormone-response elements; LIS, lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; rec, recombinant; AFM, atomic force microscopy are short DNA sequences that bind to the ribonucleoprotein network that is generally referred to as the nuclear matrix or scaffold (1Boulikas T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162: 279-388Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A subset of MARs is believed to mediate the organization of chromatin into a higher order structure consisting of multiple topologically constrained loops attached at their bases to the matrix (2Razin S.V. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 2001; 6: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar). A role for MARs in DNA replication has been proposed because many MARs contain origins of replication, and newly replicated DNA is anchored to the nuclear matrix (3Pemov A. Bavykin S. Hamlin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mapping of MARs to 5′-regulatory regions of certain genes, to actively transcribing genes, and to sites for binding activator, repressor, and demethylation proteins suggests that MARs also play a role in gene regulation (1Boulikas T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162: 279-388Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 4Bode J. Benham C. Knopp A. Mielke C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 2000; 10: 73-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MARs flanking individual genes or gene clusters in several species have been shown to act as insulator or boundary elements shielding genes within the domain from adjacent regulatory elements (5Namciu S.J. Blochlinger K.B. Fournier R.E.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2382-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MARs are identified biochemically by their selective retention in nuclear matrix preparations, which are derived from nuclei depleted of histones and most of the DNA. A set of characteristic motifs has been associated with MARs, including DNA unwinding elements, AT tracts, and DNase I-hypersensitive sites (1Boulikas T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162: 279-388Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 6Bode J. Schlake T. Rios-Ramirez M. Mielke C. Stehgert M. Kay V. Klehr-Wirth D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162: 389-454Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Binding of MARs to the matrix has not been assigned to unique DNA sequences but rather to sequences dispersed over several hundred base pairs. Recently, a unique bipartite sequence element was found in a large proportion of MARs, called the “MAR/SAR recognition signature” (MRS) (7van Drunen C.M. Sewalt R.G. Oosterling R.W. Weisbeek P.J. Smeekens S.C. van Driel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2924-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The MRS was reported to predict correctly the positions of MARs/SARs in several species from their genomic sequence alone. In this study, we examined the role of MARs adjacent to theLMP/TAP gene cluster in the class II region of the human MHC. This genomic region was chosen as a model as both its sequence, transcription, and function have been well characterized (8The MHC Sequencing Consortium Nature. 1999; 401: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar,9van Endert P.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cluster consists of four genes, LMP2 andTAP1 at the centromeric end which share a bidirectional promoter, and LMP7 and TAP2 at the telomeric end (10Beck S. Kelly A. Radley E. Khurshid F. Alderton R.P. Trowsdale J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The LMP gene products (“low molecular mass polypeptide”) enhance the degradation of cytosolic antigens into peptide fragments in the multisubunit proteasome in preparation for binding at the cell surface to MHC class I molecules (11Driscoll J. Brown M.G. Finley D. Monaco J.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). TheTAP gene products (“transporter associated with antigen processing”) are involved in the transport of these peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum where they bind newly synthesized MHC class I molecules (12Momburg F. Hämmerling H.G. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 68: 191-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the LMP and TAPgenes can be up-regulated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), resulting in an increase in processing and presentation of MHC class I-associated antigens (13Tanaka K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We used the MRS in conjunction with a pattern finding and clustering program to predict the positions of five MARs in non-coding DNA centromeric to the LMP/TAP gene cluster. Biochemical analysis confirmed that they do indeed bind the nuclear matrix and that three of these MARs recruit the mRNA processing protein hnRNP-A1 in vivo during transcriptional up-regulation. We identified a 35-bp sequence in two of these MARs that is able to bind hnRNP-A1 directly in vitro. Similar findings in the homologous region of the mouse genome suggest a conserved role for these MARs in regulation of gene expression. The MRS proposed recently (7van Drunen C.M. Sewalt R.G. Oosterling R.W. Weisbeek P.J. Smeekens S.C. van Driel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2924-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as a recognition signature for MARs has a pattern of two nucleotide motifs separated by 200 bp or less. The match required for MAR prediction is 15 of 16 bases in motif 1, AWWRTAANNWWGNNNC, and 8 of 8 bases in motif 2, AATAAYAA (IUB-IUPAC incompletely specified nucleotide code (www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iubmb/misc/naseq.html): W = A or T; R = A or G; Y = C or T; N = A C G or T). Each motif can be present in either forward or reverse orientation, and clusters of more than one example of either motif within the constraint of the pattern are regarded as a single MRS. An iteration of the Nucleotide Interpretation Program (14Staden R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar) was used to identify such MRS patterns, the output being parsed by a simple PERL script, pars_nip, to identify clusters of motifs. Entering the output into the chromosome 6 data base (6ace) allowed visualization of the MRS patterns within their genomic environment and the determination of the positions shown in Figs. 1 and 9. This procedure successfully confirmed the seven MRS patterns described in the human globin locus (GenBankTMaccession number U01317) (7van Drunen C.M. Sewalt R.G. Oosterling R.W. Weisbeek P.J.

These fractions were used in the subsequent PCR assay as templates. Positive and negative internal controls were carried out with total genomic DNA and pBR322 templates, respectively, for each sequence. Two non-MAR sequences from the same gene region were tested for their nuclear matrix binding ability as a control for assay specificity. The PCR products were separated in a 1.5% agarose gel.C, R values for the sequences binding to the nuclear matrix were estimated as in Fig. 2 B.

In experiments with up-regulated MRC5 cells, 200 units/ml IFN-γ (recombinant human IFN-γ, R & D Systems, Oxon, UK) was added to the medium for 24 h (15Pederson T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In some experiments mouse embryo monolayer NIH3T3 cells were used. These were grown and treated with IFN-γ as for MRC5 cells; however, E4 medium was used instead of RPMI 1640. The B-lymphoblastoid cell line AHB, which constitutively expresses the classical MHC and the LMP/TAP genes at high levels, was grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. In experiments to inhibit MHC class II gene expression, PGE2 was added into the culture medium for 20 h as described previously (16Roper R.L. Ludlow J.W. Phips R.P. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 154: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The nuclear matrix-attached (M) and the matrix-independent or loop (L) DNA fractions from MRC5 cells, IFN-γ up-regulated MRC5 cells, AHB and NIH3T3 cells were isolated as described previously (17Donev R.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 214: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Extractions with 25 mm LIS, 0.65m ammonium sulfate, or 2 m NaCl were employed in these separations. A PCR assay was used to identify specific DNA sequences in M- and L-fraction chromatin (18Kramer J.A. Krawetz S.A. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The M- and L-DNA fractions, 50 ng each as determined by spectrophotometric measurement, were used as templates for amplification with corresponding PCR primer pairs (Table I). In all assays, the quantity of PCR products was maintained within the linear range (increasing the concentration of template or the number of cycles proportionally increased the signal). Aliquots of the PCR products were then electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and quantified densitometrically using Labworks 3.0 software. A control ratio between the sum of intensities of the M- plus L-fractions and the band intensity of PCR product using total genomic DNA as an internal control with the same primer pair as used in the M- and L-fractions was estimated. This ratio was always ∼1 ± 0.021, confirming the equivalent efficiency of the PCR in the M- and L-fractions and in total genomic DNA. All PCR experiments were carried out in triplicate for three independent M- and L-fraction separations. Similar results were obtained and summarized in histograms.Table IPrimers, annealing temperature, and expected PCR products for amplified probesSequence namePrimersT annealingProduct length°CbpMAR15′-CCCTGTTGTTTGGTGCATACA-3′ (F)1-aF indicates forward primer, and R indicates reverse primer.522765′-AGCGAGACTCCGTCTCAAAAA-3′ (R)MAR25′-CACATCGAACTATGCCTGACT-3′ (F)521675′-GACCTATTCAAGCTGTCAGCT-3′ (R)MAR35′-ACCACCCTAGTATTCCAAGGA-3′ (F)521445′-TGATTGCACCACTGCATTTCG-3′ (R)MAR45′-CAATGCTGGTCTTGAACTCCT-3′ (F)523105′-CCAGATGGTTTCACAGATGAG-3′ (R)MAR55′-TTTAGGGAGTGGTAGAGGAAG-3′ (F)501525′-CACCCAACCCTATATAGGTAT-3′ (R)Human5′-AAAGGTGGTGACCTCCTTCGG-3′ (F)54464Non-MAR15′-GCTCAGCAGCAGAAGGAGAGA-3′ (R)Human5′-CTTCCTCCGCCTACTGTGAAG-3′ (F)54267Non-MAR25′-CCATGCCAGACTTGGAGTACG-3′ (R)Mouse MAR15′-GGTTCCCTTTGTGTGGATGCT-3′ (F)541085′-CAGATCAGCATGCCCTTCCAT-3′ (R)Mouse5′-GACCGTGAACTGGCAGCTTCA-3′ (F)54216Non-MAR15′-TGAAGGACCGGACTTCCATGG-3′ (R)Mouse5′-AACCACTGGGACTCTGGCTCT-3′ (F)54201Non-MAR25′-GGTTCTGAGCCACAAGGCAGT-3′ (R)Probe 15′-CACATCGAACTATGCCTGACT-3′ (F)53715′-CCTGGGCAACATAATGAGACC-3′ (R)Probe 25′-GCTGGTCTTGAACTC-3′ (F)50355′-GGAGGATCGCTTGAG-3′ (R)Probe 35′-TGCCTGGCCTCCTTCCCAAAA-3′ (F)54615′-GACCTATTCAAGCTGTCAGCT-3′ (R)Probe 45′-GCTGGTCTTGAACTC-3′ (F)50355′-GGAGGATCGCCTGAG-3′ (R)Probe 55′-CACCTCGGCCTCCCAGTATTA-3′ (F)542715′-CCAGATGGTTTCACAGATGAG-3′ (R)a F indicates forward primer, and R indicates reverse primer. Open table in a new tab Nuclear extracts from MRC5 cells, IFN-γ up-regulated MRC5 cells, and AHB cells were prepared. The cells were collected and washed in Buffer A (146 mmsucrose, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2). The pellet was then resuspended in Buffer A, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. After 5 min of incubation on ice, the nuclei were collected by centrifugation. The pellet was then resuspended in Buffer C (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 26% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT) to 1 × 108 nuclei/ml, and NaCl was added to a final concentration of 300 mm. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the nuclear extracts were separated from the debris by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The extracts were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The pull-down of proteins specifically binding the MARs of interest was carried out as described previously (19Nordhoff E. Krogsdam A.M. Jorgensen H.F. Kallipolitis B.H. Clark B.F. Roepstorff P. Kristiansen K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The MARs were amplified from total genomic DNA by PCR using sets of specific primers (Table I) where the reverse primers were previously biotinylated by Biotin-Chem-Link kit (Roche Diagnostics). Approximately 80 pmol of each MAR was immobilized onto 400 μg of streptavidin magnetic particles (Roche Diagnostics) following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The pull-down was performed in a final volume of 550 μl containing 100 μg of nuclear protein extract, 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 μg/μl poly[d(I-C)] (Roche Diagnostics), and 1 μg/μl sonicated salmon sperm DNA, protease inhibitor (Sigma). The reaction mixture was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature; 400 μg of streptavidin magnetic particles with attached MARs was added and the mixture incubated for a further 25 min on a rotator. After magnetic separation, the particles were washed three times with 400 μl of washing buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmDTT). The first washing buffer included 0.1 μg/μl poly[d(I-C)]. The magnetic particles were resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 7 m urea, and the eluted proteins were separated in a 12% Tris glycine pre-cast gel (Invitrogen). The gels were either silver-stained (Silver Xpress, Invitrogen) or Coomassie-stained, and proteins of interest were cut out and processed further for mass spectrometry as described previously (20Pappin D.J.C. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). By using specific primer pairs (Table II) for RT-PCR, hnRNP-A1 and the cdk inhibitor, p21, were amplified from their start to stop codons from cytoplasmic RNAs isolated from MRC5 fibroblasts and MRC5 treated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 1 h, respectively. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment of fibroblasts was necessary to up-regulate the p21 expression level in MRC5. The amplified cDNAs were cloned in the pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen). They were then transfected transiently into MRC5 fibroblast cells by SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen Ltd., UK) as suggested by the supplier. The expressed recombinant hnRNP-A1 was purified by Xpress System Protein Purification (Invitrogen), and the N-terminal fusion tag was removed by Enterokinase Max (Invitrogen).Table IIPrimers, annealing temperature, and expected RT-PCR products for amplified probesSequence namePrimersT annealingProduct length°CbphnRNP-A1 cDNA for cloning5′-ATGTCTAAGTCAGAGTCTCCTAAAGAG-3′ (F)2-aF indicates forward primer, and R indicates reverse primer.569635′-TTAAAATCTTCTGCCACTGCCATAGCT-3′ (R)p21cDNA for cloning5′-ATGTCAGAACCGGCTGGGGAT-3′ (F)534955′-TTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGATAAGA-3′ (R)hnRNP-A1mature mRNA5′-AAAGCTTAGCAGGAGAGGAGAGCCAGA-3′ (F)562795′-GCAATCAACAGCATGGGGTGC-3′ (R)rec-hnRNP-A15′-AATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ (F) (T7 primer)422325′-ATGAGAACCCCCCATGGTTT-3′ (R)TAP1 mature mRNA5′-GGGATCCTGTGACCATTGGGGCTGTAAGC-3′ (F)569995′-CTCTAGAGGTTATTCTGGAGCATCTGCAGGAGC-3′ (R)LMP2mature mRNA5′-CCGGTACCCATGCTGCGCGCGGGAGCACCAACCGGG-3′ (F)567965′-CTCTAGAGGTTACTCATCATAGAATTTTGG-3′ (R)TAP1 (intron 1) pre-mRNA5′-ACACAAGGGGACTGGGACAG-3′ (F)551705′-ATGGAGCCCAGAACCTCTGG-3′ (R)LMP2 (intron 1) pre-mRNA5′-GGCCAGAGCTGACTGTCAGT-3′ (F)551905′-CCTGTAGGAGCCTCATCTCC-3′ (R)Mouse Lmp2mature5′-TTTTGGCAGCTCATCTCCCAG-3′ (F)541115′-ATCACTCTGGCCATGAACCGA-3′ (R)Mouse Tap1mature5′-GGGAATCTTCTCCCTGTTGGT-3′ (F)542645′-GGACGACTGTTCCAGTACAGT-3′ (R)a F indicates forward primer, and R indicates reverse primer. Open table in a new tab Nuclear protein extracts and nuclear matrix protein extracts from hnRNP-A1 transfected MRC5 cells were isolated at 24-h intervals up to 96 h. The proteins were separated in a 12% Tris glycine pre-cast gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using an electroblotting apparatus XCell SureLockTM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Further procedures for detecting the recombinant hnRNP-A1 containing Xpress tag followed instructions of the Anti-XpressTM-horseradish peroxidase antibody supplier (Invitrogen). Signal detection was performed by membrane incubation in Chemiluminescence Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The MRC5 cells were transfected transiently with rec-hnRNP-A1 as described above. After 48 h of growth in culture, half of the cells were treated with IFN-γ at 200 units/ml for a further 24 h to up-regulated MHC gene expression. IFN-γ-treated and -untreated cells were collected (∼5 × 108 cells each) and fixed in tissue culture medium containing 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. All further steps of this assay were as described previously (21Orlando V. Paro R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1187-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Chromatin sonication was performed to produce DNA fragments in the range of 400–700 bp (electrophoretically determined in 1.5% agarose). The immunoprecipitation was performed with Anti-XpressTM antibody recognizing the Xpress tag in rec-hnRNP-A1. CHIP was similarly performed on AHB cells, MRC5 cells, IFN-γ up-regulated MRC5 cells, and mouse NIH3T3 with and without IFN-γ treatment for 24 h, using goat polyclonal antibody against endogenous hnRNP-A1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). In control CHIP experiments, normal goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) replaced the anti-hnRNP-A1 antibody. The naked co-immunoprecipitated DNAs were then used as templates in semi-quantitative PCR assays (50 ng of DNA/reaction) for MAR sequence detection. Primer pairs used for MAR sequence detection are given in Table I. The quantity of PCR products was again maintained within the linear range. Subsequently, aliquots of the PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and quantified densitometrically using Labworks 3.0 software. The intensities of MAR fragments amplified from co-immunoprecipitated DNA were divided by the intensity of MAR fragments amplified from total genomic DNA (50 ng of DNA/reaction) using the same primer pairs. The calculated ratio (relative binding) indicates the enrichment of co-immunoprecipitated DNA in corresponding MAR sequences, compared with their number in the same amount of genomic DNA. All PCR experiments were carried out in quadruplicate for three independent CHIP analyses. Similar results were obtained and summarized in histograms. Control real time quantitative PCR experiments were performed for human MAR4 and the single mouse MAR1 as described below.

Open table in a new tab Cytoplasmic RNAs isolated from different cell types (MRC5 and NIH3T3, MRC5 and NIH3T3 IFN-γ treated for 24 h, MRC5/rec-hnRNP-A1 transfected for 72 h, and MRC5/rec-hnRNP-A1 transfected for 72 h, and IFN-γ treated for 24 h, and AHB and AHB cells PGE2-treated for 20 h) were used as starting templates for RT-PCR to monitor the levels of mature mRNAs. To assess the levels of pre-mRNAs, total nuclear RNAs isolated from the above human cell lines were examined. Cytoplasmic and total nuclear RNAs were isolated as described previously (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.6-7.12Google Scholar). The subsequent semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using specific primers shown in Table II and Qiagen® One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) following the supplier's recommendations. Control experiments with β-actin were carried out using standard primers (Promega). Aliquots of the RT-PCR products were separated in a 1.5% agarose gel, ethidium bromide-stained, and quantified densitometrically using Labworks 3.0 software. All RT-PCR experiments were carried out in triplicate for two independent RNA isolations. Similar results were obtained and summarized in histograms. Each relative expression value represents a ratio between the densities of specific mRNA transcripts to corresponding β-actintranscripts. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs were isolated from MRC5 cells and MRC5 transfected with p21 for 20 h and treated with IFN-γ for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. They were used as starting templates for real time quantitative RT-PCR. Aliquots of the RNAs were reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and Multiscribe reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), taking into account intron/exon boundaries to ensure specific amplification of cDNA (Table III). Primers were designed to β-actin as an internal control for normalization of starting cDNA levels. Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems), with the exception that 25-μl reaction volumes were used, with 45 cycles of amplification. Each of the primer pairs was optimized to ensure amplification of the specific product and absence of primer dimers (Table III). PCR was performed on the Taqman 7700 (Applied Biosystems). Following amplification, RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels to check for the correctly sized product. The real time PCR results were analyzed using the sequence detection system software version 1.9 (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression levels were calculated using the comparative Ct method (ΔΔCt). ΔΔCt validation experiments showed similar amplification efficiency for all templates used (difference between line slopes for all templates less than 0.1). Expression levels of the genes were normalized to those in MRC5 cells without IFN-γ treatment. At least two independent experiments were performed for each gene. Similar results were obtained and summarized in histograms. hnRNP-A1 recruitment in vivo to human MAR4 was examined by CHIP at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after the start of IFN-γ treatment of MRC5 cells and p21-transfected MRC5 cells. Immunoprecipitated DNAs were used as templates in subsequent real time quantitative PCR experiments. Levels of protein recruitment were calculated according to the ΔΔCt method. Similar amplification efficiencies were shown for all templates used. Recruitment levels to MAR4 were normalized to that in MRC5 cells without IFN-γ treatment. Two independent experiments were carried out. Similar results were obtained and summarized in histograms. Recruitment of hnRNP-A1 to the single mouse MAR1 was examined in NIH3T3 cells 0 and 24 h after IFN-γ treatment. Results were analyzed as for the human MAR4. Direct hnRNP-A1 binding to the MARs was investigated by examining DNA-protein complexes by AFM topography imaging as described previously (23Donev R.M. Doneva T.A. Bowen W.R. Sheer D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 233: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and by EMSA. Sets of specific primer pairs were used for amplification of the probes for EMSA (Table I). Probes 1–5 were labeled with horseradish peroxidase using the North2South Direct horseradish peroxidase labeling and detection kit (Pierce). Each probe (80 ng) was incubated with 100, 200, or 300 ng of hnRNP-A1 for 50 min in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol), containing either 0.1 μg/μl poly[d(I-C)] or 0.1 μg/μl poly[d(I-C)] combined with 1 μg/μl sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Labeled probes 1–5 and those from the incubation reactions were separated in a 2% agarose gel. The DNA signal was detected by chemiluminescence. The coordinates for each human MAR and gene CDS (Fig. 1) in the nucleotide sequence GenBankTMaccession number X87344 are as follows: MAR1 (81997–82190), MAR2 (84791–84899), MAR3 (90295–90323), MAR4 (90593–90800), MAR5 (93872–93977), LMP2 (94885–100219), TAP1(100813–109220), LMP7 (110036–113708), and TAP2(116217–127095). The schematic of the mouseLmp/Tap region (Fig. 9 A) is derived from GenBankTM accession numbers U35323 (24Peleraux A. Karlsson L. Chambers J. Peterson P.A. Immunogenetics. 1996; 43: 204-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and AF027865. The single MAR is located 168 bases downstream of Lmp2 which is transcribed in the negative orientation (telomere to centromere). Sequences used to design primers for cloning of hnRNP-A1 and the cdk inhibitor, p21, from their start to stop codons were NM_002136 and NM_000389, respectively. A total number of 323 clustered MRS-containing genomic fragments were found in the MHC (Fig. 1). Five of these fragments immediately centromeric of theLMP/TAP gene cluster in the MHC class II region were then studied in detail. The ability of these five fragments and two random fragments from the same region, which do not contain the MRS, to bind to the nuclear matrix and therefore to function as MARs was tested by PCR (18Kramer J.A. Krawetz S.A. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The level of relative binding (R) of each DNA fragment to the nuclear matrix was determined as described previously (17Donev R.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 214: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cell types with different profiles of MHC class II gene expression were used to determine whether transcriptional status in the region is relevant to the functioning of these MAR sequences. The human fibroblast cell line MRC5 expresses theLMP/TAP genes at low levels and does not express the classical MHC class II genes. Expression of all these genes is greatly increased when MRC5 cells are treated with IFN-γ for 24 h (25Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar). The B-lymphoblastoid cell line AHB constitutively expresses these genes at high levels. We found that all five genomic fragments containing the MRS from theLMP/TAP gene region bound to the nuclear matrix, regardless of the extraction method used (Fig. 2). These fragments were thus designated MAR1–5. In all three cell types extracted with lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate (LIS) and ammonium sulfate, MARs-1, -3, -4, and -5 were detected in nuclear matrix fraction only (R = 100%). In contrast, MAR2 showed substantially different levels of matrix binding in cells with different levels of MHC gene expression. Around 40% of MAR2 sequences were found in the nuclear matrix fra"
https://openalex.org/W1998060777,"Telomeres protect the ends of linear chromosomes from abnormal recombination events and buffer them against terminal DNA loss. Models of telomere replication predict that two daughter molecules have one end that is blunt, the product of leading-strand synthesis, and one end with a short G-rich 3′-overhang. However, experimental data from proliferating cells are not completely consistent with this model. For example, telomeres of human chromosomes have long G-rich 3′-overhangs, and the persistence of blunt ends is uncertain. Here we show that the product of leading-strand synthesis is not always blunt but can contain a long C-rich 5′-tail, the incompletely replicated template of the leading strand. We examined the presence of G-rich and C-rich single-strand DNA in fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Although there were no significant changes in the length distribution of the 3′-overhang, the 5′-overhangs were mostly present in S phase. Similar results were obtained using telomerase-negative fibroblasts. The amount and the length distribution of the 5′ C-rich tails strongly correlate with the proliferative rate of the cell cultures. Our results suggest that, contrary to what has commonly been supposed, completion of leading-strand synthesis is inefficient and could well drive telomere shortening."
https://openalex.org/W2087587258,"Mutation of the cyanide-insensitive terminal oxidase of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> leads to pleiotropic effects. A <i>cio</i> mutant and strains, including the wild-type, carrying the <i>cioAB</i>genes on a multicopy plasmid were temperature-sensitive and had a cell division defect, leading to the formation of non-septate, multinucleated filaments. Such strains of this intrinsically antibiotic-resistant bacterium were more sensitive to a range of antibiotics including chloramphenicol, β-lactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. The effect of <i>cio</i> mutation on Δp-dependent accumulation of chloramphenicol suggested that antibiotic sensitivity resulted from loss of or damage to a multidrug efflux pump. The ability of reducing agents and catalase to suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype and of catalase to partially suppress antibiotic sensitivity suggested that increased levels of reactive oxygen species might be the cause of the observed phenotypes. Consistent with this was the increased sensitivity of strains to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and their increased protein carbonyl content, an indicator of oxidative protein modification. The temperature-dependent synthesis of a specific catalase was absent in the <i>cio</i> mutant and in strains carrying multiple plasmid-borne copies of <i>cioAB</i>. We propose that reduced catalase levels result in oxidative modification and consequent loss of function of proteins involved in a range of cellular functions. How mutation or overexpression of the cyanide-insensitive terminal oxidase leads to a loss of catalase activity is unknown at present."
https://openalex.org/W2111631249,"In the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, the polypeptides stored in secretory dense core granules (DCGs) are generated by proteolytic processing of precursors, and the mature products assemble as a crystal. Previous observations suggested that this maturation involves precise cleavage at distinct motifs by a small number of enzymes. To test these inferences, we analyzed the determinants for site-specific processing of pro-Grl1p (Granule lattice protein 1) by complete gene replacement with modified alleles. Contrary to the predictions of previous models, none of the component amino acids in a putative processing motif was necessary for targeted cleavage. Indeed, cleavage at a range of alternative positions near the native site was consistent with normal DCG assembly. Furthermore, substitution of other classes of processing site motifs did not perturb DCG structure or function. These results suggest that processing can be catalyzed by multiple proteases, for which substrate accessibility may be the prime determinant of site specificity. Consistent with this, inhibition of either subtilisin or cathepsin family proteases resulted in delayed processing of pro-Grl1p. In the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, the polypeptides stored in secretory dense core granules (DCGs) are generated by proteolytic processing of precursors, and the mature products assemble as a crystal.

Tooze S.A. Barr F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1358: 6-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells, pro-insulin is cleaved by subtilisin-related enzymes called prohormone convertases (PCs), to generate mature active insulin (see Ref. 2Steiner D.F. Nature. 1973; 243: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 3Rouille Y. Duguay G.J. Lund K. Furuta M. Gong Q. Lipkind G. Oliva A.A., Jr. Chan G.J. Steiner D.F. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 322-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This is also linked to structural transitions; whereas proinsulin will dimerize in the trans-Golgi network and immature granule compartments, only processed insulin forms the crystal core of mature DCGs (4Brange J.

The PCs recognize and cleave substrates following paired basic residues, which may be presented in the context of defined local structures (6Bailyes E.M. Shennan K.I. Seal A.J. Smeekens S.P.

The enzyme activities are sensitive to both pH and calcium concentration, with the result that processing occurs in specific sub-compartments of the secretory pathway (9Davidson H.W. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Nature. 1988; 333: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). PCs are not the only class of enzymes involved in proprotein processing in secretory granules. A variety of less well characterized enzymes appear to play roles in metazoans (10Che F.Y. Yan L., Li, H. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An orthologous set of granule cargo proteins in Paramecium tetraurelia are the trichocyst matrix proteins (tmps) (18Steers E., Jr. Beisson J. Marchesi V.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1969; 57: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Tindall S.H. DeVito L.D. Nelson D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 441-447PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shih S.J. Nelson D.L. J.

In both organisms, the granule cores consist of highly organized protein crystals that undergo spring-like expansion upon exocytosis. This mechanism propels the granule cargo into the environs of the cells. Each T. thermophila cell contains several thousand DCGs, virtually all of which are docked at the plasma membrane, so cargo release upon exocytic stimulation is massive and synchronous (22Satir B. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1977; 1: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Proprotein processing within immature DCGs in ciliates appears closely linked with organization and function of the granule cores. First, only processed proteins can be detected within the crystallizing cores (23Hausmann K. Fok A.K. Allen R.D. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1988; 99: 213-225Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Shih S.J. Nelson D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 349-361PubMed Google Scholar). Second, defects in proprotein processing and core assembly are strictly correlated in mutants (25Adoutte A. Garreau de Loubresse N. Beisson J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 1065-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Turkewitz A.P. Madeddu L. Kelly R.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Gautier M.-C.

Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Third, mutants defective in core assembly are also defective in rapid extrusion of DCG cargo upon exocytosis (29Chilcoat N.D. Melia S.M. Haddad A. Turkewitz A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally, while the precise structural basis for the spring mechanism is unknown, a conformational transition in processed Grl1p is correlated with expansion but does not occur in the proprotein (17Verbsky J.W. Turkewitz A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that, as in neuroendocrine cells, proprotein processing is an essential regulatory mechanism for assembly of functional DCGs in ciliates. However, neither the processing enzymes themselves nor the processing determinants within the proproteins are known. Candidates for the latter have been deduced by comparing Grl and tmp sequences.As a family the Grls/tmps share less than 20% amino acid identity, but regions of limited sequence similarity flank the known proteolytic processing sites and have therefore been tentatively identified as targets for processing proteases (17Verbsky J.W. Turkewitz A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Madeddu L. Gautier M.C., Le Caer J.P. Garreau de Loubresse N. Sperling L. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). At least some of the Grls/tmps are cleaved twice to yield two mature peptides, and a single proprotein can contain a different motif at each of two processing sites. The simplest model is that, as for proinsulin, each of the motifs is recognized by a distinct endopeptidase whose activity is regulated by substrate availability and compartmental conditions. Alternatively, a single enzyme may recognize multiple motifs but with different affinities (30Vayssie L. Garreau De Loubresse N. Sperling L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 875-886PubMed Google Scholar).We have now characterized the activities responsible for Grl1p processing in vivo by generating Grl1p variants with substitutions at residues surrounding the known cleavage site. By using complete replacement of the wild type gene with these modified alleles, we could test the relevance of the putative recognition motifs for processing site specificity and granule assembly. To extend this analysis we asked whether the cleavage of different putative motifs was dependent on their position within the polypeptide. We demonstrate that cleavage does not depend on any residues in the putative processing motifs. The precise locus of cleavage can be subtly shifted in these variants, but this does not compromise the assembly or function of the resulting cores. These results, supported by protease inhibition experiments, strongly suggest that this system depends on multiple proteases that can collectively cleave at a wide variety of peptide bonds.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated.Cell CultureCell cultures were gently swirled at 30 °C in SPP (2% proteose peptone, 0.2% yeast extract (both from Difco) with 0.009% ferric EDTA). T. thermophila strain CU428.1 (mpr1-1/mpr1-1 (mp-s, VII)) was provided by Peter Bruns (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The strain is wild type with respect to regulated exocytosis. Genetic nomenclature for T. thermophila can be found in Ref. 31Allen S.L. Altschuler M.I. Bruns P.J. Cohen J. Doerder F.P. Gaertig J. Gorovsky M. Orias E. Turkewitz A. Genetics. 1998; 149: 459-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar.Site-directed MutagenesisIn general, variants of Grl1p were generated by inverse PCR using as template pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing theKpnI-BglII fragment of the GRL1genomic sequence. Expand High Fidelity Polymerase was used (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by a 5-min polish with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to remove 3′ As. Several variants (details on primers accessible at home.uchicago.edu/∼nelselde) were generated using the Quick Change Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Clones were sequenced across the entire insert using M13.F and M13.R primers and the Big Dye sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Inserts were then shuttled into a vector containing GRL1 cDNA sequence carrying a silent mutation (C249G,T250C,A252G) that introduces a PstI site and 1100 bases of 3′- and 500 bases of 5′-genomic flank. The NEO2 cassette, which confers resistance to paromomycin sulfate inT. thermophila, was inserted in the XhoI site 500 bases downstream. In cases where novel sequences were inserted, we chose the codons used most frequently in highly expressedT. thermophila genes (32Wuitschick J.D. Karrer K.M. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1999; 46: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the case of the exchange of the GRL1 sequence with those from GRL3,GRL5, and GRL7, we used the exact coding sequence from the respective genes.Transformation and Gene ReplacementParticle-mediated transformation of T. thermophila was as described (33Cassidy-Hanley D. Bowen J. Lee J.H. Cole E. VerPlank L.A. Gaertig J. Gorovsky M.A. Bruns P.J. Genetics. 1997; 146: 135-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were bombarded with 15 μg of DNA digested with BamHI and SacI and were recovered in SPP containing 100 μg/ml paromomycin sulfate. Cell lines were transferred every 2nd day to media of increasing drug concentration until the mutant construct had replaced all macronuclear copies of wild type Grl1p. Complete replacement was confirmed by Southern blotting of genomic DNA digested with PstI and HindIII, using a probe corresponding to the GRL1 gene.Western BlottingSDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) was performed according to Ref. 34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (205903) Google Scholar. Antibody blotting on nitrocellulose membranes was according to Ref. 35Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44696) Google Scholar, and antibodies were visualized using signal substrate (Pierce). The rabbit antiserum specific for Grl1p (called anti-p40) has been described (26Turkewitz A.P. Madeddu L. Kelly R.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Isolation of DCG cargo was performed by dibucaine stimulation (see below) followed by differential centrifugation, as described in Ref. 36Turkewitz A.P. Chilcoat N.D. Haddad A. Verbsky J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 2000; 62: 347-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar.Exocytosis AssaysTwo different secretagogues induce massive regulated exocytosis in T. thermophila. Exposure to dibucaine triggers rapid secretion of granule contents, which can subsequently be isolated in a highly purified form (16Maihle N.J. Satir B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7566-7570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure to Alcian blue similarly triggers global fusion of DCGs, but this dye also precipitates the DCG contents as they are being secreted, with the result that cells become instantaneously encapsulated (37Tiedtke A. Naturwissenschaften. 1976; 63: 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such capsules are easily detected by light microscopy (×100–400). The first assay can therefore be used to assess the exocytic competence of a culture, whereas the second is useful for judging the competence of individual cells.Cells were grown to stationary phase (∼106/ml), washed once, and then starved overnight in DMC, a 1:10 dilution of Dryl's medium (1.7 mm sodium citrate, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.5 mmCaCl2) with additional 100 μmMgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (38Orias E. Flacks M. Satir B.H. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 64: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated by vigorous addition of Alcian blue 8GX (1%) to 0.025%. Following light agitation for 30 s, the cells were diluted with at least 10 volumes of 0.25% proteose peptone, 0.5 mm CaCl2. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 45 s in a clinical centrifuge and fixed with formalin, and the fraction of encapsulated cells was determined.N-terminal SequencingCells grown to stationary phase in 2% proteose peptone, 0.2% yeast extract, 0.003% iron EDTA were stimulated to secrete with 2.5 mm dibucaine, and the secreted material was purified. In the final step, the secreted protein was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min to yield a flocculent pellet whose volume was estimated. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to 10%, and the sample was heated at 55 °C for 30 min. Under these conditions, virtually all mature Grl1p remains soluble, whereas most other polypeptides form aggregates. 2A. Turkewitz, unpublished data. Samples were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide, 0.09% bisacrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Osmonics, Westboro, MA). The strong band(s) corresponding to mature Grl1p were excised and subjected to 5 cycles of N-terminal sequencing by automated Edman degradation (Carol Beech, Macromolecular Structure Analysis Facility, University of Kentucky).Biosynthetic LabelingCells grown to stationary phase were pelleted and starved for 2 h in DMC. They were stimulated with Alcian blue, as above, and then resuspended for 1 h in DMC. 2 × 106 cells/ml were labeled for 15 min with 0.1 mCi/ml [3H]lysine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in DMC. Cells were then separated from the labeling medium by pelleting through a pad of 5% Ficoll in DMC with 2 mg/ml lysine and resuspended in DMC with 2 mg/ml lysine at 106 cells/ml. At each time point, 106 cells were withdrawn and lysed by addition of 1/4th volume of 5× NDET (NDET is 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 66 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) with protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 12.5 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml E-64, 10 μg/ml chymostatin). Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, after which the insoluble fraction was pelleted at 17,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were pre-cleared with Sepharose CL4B and then incubated with protein A-conjugated Sepharose that had been preincubated with anti-p40 antibody. For experiments done in the presence of protease inhibitors, cells were treated as above with the following variations. Following stimulation cells were allowed to settle to remove the small fraction of cells trapped in capsules. Cells were incubated for 1 h following stimulation in DMC supplemented with protease inhibitors as follows: 20 μm subtilisin inhibitor III (Calbiochem), 10 μm cathepsin inhibitor III(Calbiochem), 50 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-CH2F (gift of Jim Miller, University of Chicago), and all subsequent steps prior to detergent lysis were done in the presence of inhibitors.MicroscopyFor electron microscopy, cells were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde, 1% osmium tetroxide, as described (26Turkewitz A.P. Madeddu L. Kelly R.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence images of regranulating cells were obtained by stimulating 50 ml of a 2-h starved culture with Alcian blue, as described above. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.25% proteose peptone, 0.5 mm CaCl2. The cells were allowed to settle for ∼10 min until a clear separation was visible between the settled blue-stained secreted material and free swimming cells that concentrated at the meniscus. These were collected and diluted to 20 ml with DMC. At each time point, 4 ml were pelleted and fixed in ice-cold 50% EtOH, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, pelleted, and resuspended in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. DCGs were detected using monoclonal antibody 4D11 (39Turkewitz A.P. Kelly R.B. Dev. Genet. 1992; 13: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a gift of Marlo Nelsen and Joe Frankel, University of Iowa.RESULTSFrom earlier studies, pro-Grl1p is known to be cleaved following Lys188, and the surrounding region can be aligned with sequences flanking cleavage sites in two other Grl proproteins (17Verbsky J.W. Turkewitz A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,29Chilcoat N.D. Melia S.M. Haddad A. Turkewitz A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). First, each cleavage site lies downstream of a small zone of basic residues (schematic in Table II). Short positively charged regions upstream of cleavage sites are conspicuous in proteins that are otherwise highly acidic. Close upstream of each cleavage site lies a cluster of hydrophobic residues at moderately conserved positions (Table I). The P′3 position (the residue 3 positions downstream of the cleaved peptide bond) is generally occupied by a hydrophobic residue, and there is always at least one hydrophobic residue in the first three positions following the cleavage site. Most significantly, the P1 position (that immediately preceding the cleaved peptide bond) is always occupied by a basic residue. Some or all of these shared features are potentially important for cleavage site specificity and are therefore indirect determinants of lattice assembly during granule biosynthesis. Alternatively, the role played by these features may be secondary to specificity based on accessibility in an otherwise tightly folded polypeptide. Only in the first instance would modifying these putative motifs be likely to interfere with pro-Grl1p processing and DCG formation.Table IIGRL1 mutant allelesModified sequences are aligned vertically with respect to the wild type sequence shown at the bottom. The arrow indicates the position of the peptide bond between Lys188 and Glu189 that is cleaved in the wild type. Sequenced N termini of the mutant proteins are shown in boldface. In cases where alternative cleavages generated two mature polypeptides, the sequence determined from the smaller product is underlined. N termini that were inferred based on gel mobility shifts are indicated in italics. The single exception is construct 10 (ΔLys188,Glu189), for which we concluded that the cleavages occur somewhere within the 4 downstream residues following Glu187, based on the mobility of the products. Names of constructs are based on the single letter code for amino acids. Open table in a new tab Table IConserved motifs in proGrlps and tmpsThe N-terminal residue of the mature processed peptides, as determined by Edman degradation, are shown in boldface in A–C. Amino acids that are relatively conserved are boxed. A, alignment of sequences in which cleavage occurs following a single basic residue. B, alignment of sequences at which cleavage occurs following a glycine residue. C, alignment of sequences in which cleavage occurs following a single asparagine residue. Open table in a new tab To test the physiological importance of these features, we replaced all expressed (macronuclear) copies of GRL1 with variants altered in sequence at or around the cleavage site. In general, these variants of Grl1p, shown in Table II, fall into four classes as follows: 1) deletion of large regions around the cleavage site; 2) replacement of Lys188; 3) alteration of the hydrophobic residues flanking the cleavage site; and 4) up- or downstream translocation of residues immediately flanking the cleavage site. The products of such gene replacements are cells in which the variant genes are expressed at the endogenous locus, with the bacterial gene (NEO2) that confers neomycin resistance inserted in the downstream flank. The insertion of NEO2 allowed us to drive complete gene replacement (40Gaertig J. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9196-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To confirm that the insertion of the heterologous gene did not itself interfere with Grl1p processing or granule assembly, we first replaced the wild type gene with an identical copy flanked by NEO2. The resulting drug-resistant transformants were indistinguishable from wild type in all DCG-related phenotypes. Complete replacement by the novel alleles could be distinguished by virtue of an engineered silent mutation that introduced a novel restriction site, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Remarkably, each of the Grl1p variants in the four classes was processed to yield a product whose mobility approximated that of the wild type mature peptide (Fig. 1). The samples in Fig. 1 represent protein released within seconds following stimulation of cell cultures with the secretagogue dibucaine, indicating that both wild type and variant proteins were stored in functional DCGs. Under these conditions, protein release from one mutant with a large upstream deletion, Δ161–187, was markedly less than in wild type (not shown). The processing also appeared to be roughly as precise as that of the wild type protein, since the products appeared as a single band or a closely spaced doublet. However, the gel mobilities also indicated that alternative cleavage sites were being used in some variants. To understand how these were specified and thereby gain insight into site selection in the wild type protein, we analyzed each of these four classes in detail. An underlying question was, why are residues surrounding the cleavage site conserved if their substitution does not affect pro-Grl1p processing?The Role of the P1 Residue in Site SelectionPrecise target recognition may be determined in large part by the P1 residue, as a result of the physical restrictions of the substrate-binding pocket. The potential importance of Lys188 as a determinant was also reinforced by preliminary analysis of one of the variants. N-terminal sequencing of proteins isolated from stimulated cell supernatants allowed precise determination of the cleavage sites in the altered proteins. In Δ161–187 the 27 amino acids upstream of Lys188 were deleted, which includes the stretch of basic amino acids (Table II, line 1). Nonetheless the N-terminal residue of the mature polypeptide remained identical to that in the wild type, Glu189. This implied that processing takes place following Lys188, the identical residue targeted in the wild type protein. This result suggested that target site selection is not designated in any straightforward manner by the amino acid sequence upstream of the P1 residue and, in particular, that the basic region is not an essential determinant.We therefore focused on the potential role of the single basic residue at the P1 position, by replacing Lys188 with a variety of other amino acids (Table II, lines 3–9). The conservative substitution of Lys188 with Arg had no effect, but replacement with either negatively charged or uncharged residues led to small shifts in the processing site. Substitutions by Ala (K188A) or Pro (K188P) shifted the processing site one residue downstream, to Glu189. Substitution with either Asp (K188D), Glu (K188E), or Trp (K188W) led to cleavage following Glu187. A basic residue in the wild type protein may therefore be part of the preferred substrate for the processing protease, but the locus of cleavage, as defined within the range of a single residue, must be determined by other features. A striking outcome of these results was the implication that processing, which takes place after a basic residue in the wild type protein, can also occur following negatively charged residues. In addition, a hydrophobic residue at the P′1 position is acceptable.One possibility was that charge density rather than the particular charges was important for site determination, since the wild type sequence is Glu187–Lys188–Glu189and the variants above maintain at least two charged residues. Accordingly, we deleted both Lys188 and Glu189(ΔLys188, Glu+) (Table II, line 10). Processing was also seen in this variant, producing a doublet of products whose mobility indicated that the cleavages had almost certainly occurred within the first three or four residues, none of which is charged. While the precise N termini were not determined for these products, results below directly demonstrate that a variety of downstream residues can be accommodated and confirm the premise that no flanking charged residues are required.Replacement of Adjacent Hydrophobic Residues Leads to a Change in Site SelectionSince the residues at, or immediately adjoining, the cleavage site are apparently not essential for specificity, we focused on potential structural cues. In particular, we asked whether flanking residues somewhat more distal to the cleavage site were involved in creating a 2° element, such as a flexible exposed loop, which could be targeted by a protease. As noted above, the cleavage site is flanked by nearby hydrophobic residues that could anchor and thereby define a short loop. We therefore replaced these residues both up- and downstream of Lys188.We substituted the downstream residues Tyr190 and Val191 with acidic residues to generate Y190D,V191E (TableII, line 12). This resulted in a minor change in processing specificity. We observed two products, which were generated by alternative cleavage following Glu187 and Lys188. To be certain that this change did not result from the presence of charged residues as opposed to the absence of hydrophobic residues, we replaced Tyr191, Val192 with alanines (Y191A,V192A) (Table II, line 11). Similar cleavage products were obtained. These results suggest that if local 2° structure orients cleavage specificity, it does not depend on these downstream residues. However, the presence of two alternatively processed products hinted that these residues m"
