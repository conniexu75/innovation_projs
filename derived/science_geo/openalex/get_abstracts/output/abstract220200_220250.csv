https://openalex.org/W2020093054,"We present a simple and intuitive picture, an electromagnetic analog of molecular orbital theory, that describes the plasmon response of complex nanostructures of arbitrary shape. Our model can be understood as the interaction or ""hybridization"" of elementary plasmons supported by nanostructures of elementary geometries. As an example, the approach is applied to the important case of a four-layer concentric nanoshell, where the hybridization of the plasmons of the inner and outer nanoshells determines the resonant frequencies of the multilayer nanostructure."
https://openalex.org/W2137440275,"We have previously shown correction of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID-X1, also known as gamma chain (gamma(c)) deficiency] in 9 out of 10 patients by retrovirus-mediated gamma(c) gene transfer into autologous CD34 bone marrow cells. However, almost 3 years after gene therapy, uncontrolled exponential clonal proliferation of mature T cells (with gammadelta+ or alphabeta+ T cell receptors) has occurred in the two youngest patients. Both patients' clones showed retrovirus vector integration in proximity to the LMO2 proto-oncogene promoter, leading to aberrant transcription and expression of LMO2. Thus, retrovirus vector insertion can trigger deregulated premalignant cell proliferation with unexpected frequency, most likely driven by retrovirus enhancer activity on the LMO2 gene promoter."

We used QDs to track individual glycine receptors (GlyRs) and analyze their lateral dynamics in the neuronal membrane of living cells for periods ranging from milliseconds to minutes. We characterized multiple diffusion domains in relation to the synaptic, perisynaptic, or extrasynaptic GlyR localization. The entry of GlyRs into the synapse by diffusion was observed and further confirmed by electron microscopy imaging of QD-tagged receptors."

The near K-edge spectroscopy of carbon using synchrotron x-ray inelastic scattering reveals that half of the pi-bonds between graphite layers convert to sigma-bonds, whereas the other half remain as pi-bonds in the high-pressure form. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the high-pressure form is consistent with a distorted graphite structure in which bridging carbon atoms between graphite layers pair and form sigma-bonds, whereas the nonbridging carbon atoms remain unpaired with pi-bonds. The high-pressure form is superhard, capable of indenting cubic-diamond single crystals."

https://openalex.org/W2156396074,"Local, controlled induction of angiogenesis remains a challenge that limits tissue engineering approaches to replace or restore diseased tissues. We present a new class of bioactive synthetic hydrogel matrices based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and synthetic peptides that exploits the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) alongside the base matrix functionality for cellular ingrowth, that is, induction of cell adhesion by pendant RGD-containing peptides and provision of cell-mediated remodeling by cross-linking matrix metalloproteinase substrate peptides. By using a Michael-type addition reaction, we incorporated variants of VEGF121 and VEGF165 covalently within the matrix, available for cells as they invade and locally remodel the material. The functionality of the matrix-conjugated VEGF was preserved and was critical for in vitro endothelial cell survival and migration within the matrix environment. Consistent with a scheme of locally restricted availability of VEGF, grafting of these VEGF-modified hydrogel matrices atop the chick chorioallontoic membrane evoked strong new blood vessel formation precisely at the area of graft-membrane contact. When implanted subcutaneously in rats, these VEGF-containing matrices were completely remodeled into native, vascularized tissue. This type of synthetic, biointeractive matrix with integrated angiogenic growth factor activity, presented and released only upon local cellular demand, could become highly useful in a number of clinical healing applications of local therapeutic angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2171220265,"Aqueous solutions are generally assumed to be superior electrolytic conductors because of the unique dielectric and fluid properties of water. We show that their conductivities can be matched by liquid electrolytes that contain no solvent. These are proton transfer salts that are liquid at ambient temperature. The high conductivities are due to the high fluidity and ionicity rather than some sort of Grotthus mechanism, although in certain cases a mobile proton population may make a non-negligible contribution. The highest conductivities have been obtained when both cations and anions contain protons. At 25 degrees C, values of >150 millisiemens per centimeter (mS x cm(-1)) appear possible; at 100 degrees C, 470 mS x cm(-1) has been measured. Because of the combination of high ionicity and proton exchange kinetics with low vapor pressure, the systems we describe also make excellent fuel cell electrolytes."
https://openalex.org/W2164396922,"The Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) Rac1 and Rac2 are critical signaling regulators in mammalian cells. The deletion of both Rac1 and Rac2 murine alleles leads to a massive egress of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC/Ps) into the blood from the marrow, whereas Rac1 –/– but not Rac2 –/– HSC/Ps fail to engraft in the bone marrow of irradiated recipient mice. In contrast, Rac2, but not Rac1, regulates superoxide production and directed migration in neutrophils, and in each cell type, the two GTPases play distinct roles in actin organization, cell survival, and proliferation. Thus, Rac1 and Rac2 regulate unique aspects of hematopoietic development and function."
https://openalex.org/W2046332655,"Digital elevation models of the Northern and Southern Patagonia Icefields of South America generated from the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission were compared with earlier cartography to estimate the volume change of the largest 63 glaciers. During the period 1968/1975-2000, these glaciers lost ice at a rate equivalent to a sea level rise of 0.042 +/- 0.002 millimeters per year. In the more recent years 1995-2000, average ice thinning rates have more than doubled to an equivalent sea level rise of 0.105 +/- 0.011 millimeters per year. The glaciers are thinning more quickly than can be explained by warmer air temperatures and decreased precipitation, and their contribution to sea level per unit area is larger than that of Alaska glaciers."
https://openalex.org/W2058106363,"The c-Myc protein is a transcription factor that is a central regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Thr-58 is a major phosphorylation site in c-Myc and is a mutational hotspot in Burkitt's and other aggressive human lymphomas, indicating that Thr-58 phosphorylation restricts the oncogenic potential of c-Myc. Mutation of Thr-58 is also associated with increased c-Myc protein stability. Here we show that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity with lithium increases c-Myc stability and inhibits phosphorylation of c-Myc specifically at Thr-58 in vivo. Conversely, overexpression of GSK-3α or GSK-3β enhances Thr-58 phosphorylation and ubiquitination of c-Myc. Together, these observations suggest that phosphorylation of Thr-58 mediated by GSK-3 facilitates c-Myc rapid proteolysis by the ubiquitin pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GSK-3 binds c-Myc in vivo and in vitro and that GSK-3 colocalizes with c-Myc in the nucleus, strongly arguing that GSK-3 is the c-Myc Thr-58 kinase. We found that c-MycS, which lacks the N-terminal 100 amino acids of c-Myc, is unable to bind GSK-3; however, mutation of Ser-62, the priming phosphorylation site necessary for Thr-58 phosphorylation, does not disrupt GSK-3 binding. Finally, we show that Thr-58 phosphorylation alters the subnuclear localization of c-Myc, enhancing its localization to discrete nuclear bodies together with GSK-3.

Finally, we show that Thr-58 phosphorylation alters the subnuclear localization of c-Myc, enhancing its localization to discrete nuclear bodies together with GSK-3. The c-myc proto-oncogene encodes a short-lived nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in multiple cellular processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Expression of c-myc is rapidly induced by mitogens and is down-regulated during differentiation (1Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-Myc activity is sufficient to drive cells into the cell cycle in the absence of growth factors (2Eilers M. Schirm S. Bishop J.M.

Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3004-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The c-Myc protein is a basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine-zipper (bHL-HZip) transcription factor that, together with its dimerization partner Max, binds specific E-box sequences and up-regulates gene transcription. Additionally, c-Myc represses the transcription of specific genes through inhibition of activators (6Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 7Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 81-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). c-Myc is thought to exert its oncogenic effects through regulation of genes involved with growth and proliferation. Rapid proteolysis of c-Myc occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (10Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 11Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. The EMBO Journal. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In most cell types examined, c-Myc has an extremely short protein half-life, usually 15–30 min. However, in Burkitt's lymphoma cells, c-Myc is substantially stabilized, exhibiting a half-life of up to 2 h (10Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell.

The extended half-life of c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells is associated with mutation at or near a major phosphorylation site within c-Myc, Thr-58, suggesting that Thr-58 phosphorylation accelerates c-Myc proteolysis. Indeed, mutation of Thr-58 causes an increase in c-Myc stability (10Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 11Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) 1The abbreviations used are: GSK-3glycogen synthase kinase-3DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCMVcytomegalovirusHAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered saline. is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase that was initially identified as the kinase that phosphorylates glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogen metabolism. There are two mammalian isoforms of GSK-3 encoded by different genes, GSK-3α (51 kDa) and GSK-3β (47 kDa), which are highly homologous and share substrate specificity in vitro. In resting cells, GSK-3 is constitutively active and is inactivated by various hormonal and mitogenic signaling pathways (18Woodgett J.R. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE12Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19Manoukian A.S. Woodgett J.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). GSK-3 phosphorylates a broad range of substrates including a number of important growth regulators such as β-catenin (20Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), cyclin D1 (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has long been known that GSK-3 is capable of phosphorylating c-Myc at Thr-58 in vitro (17Pulverer B.J. Fischer K. Vousden K. Littlewood T. Evan G. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that phosphorylation of Thr-58 by GSK-3α in vitro requires prior phosphorylation of Ser-62, which is also a requirement for Thr-58 phosphorylation of c-Myc in vivo (23Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, kinases that phosphorylate c-Myc in vitro have often proven not to be bona fide c-Myc kinases in vivo (24Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Only recently has it been reported that GSK-3 acts upstream of c-Myc in vivo, resulting in Thr-58 phosphorylation (13Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). glycogen synthase kinase-3 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cytomegalovirus hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline. In this study, we sought to determine whether GSK-3 controls c-Myc proteolysis and whether GSK-3 directly phosphorylates c-Myc at Thr-58 in vivo. We report compelling evidence that GSK-3 is the bona fide c-Myc Thr-58 kinase. We found that phosphorylation of Thr-58 in vivo depends on GSK-3 activity and that c-Myc binds to GSK-3 both in vivo and in vitro. We also demonstrate that GSK-3 regulates ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of c-Myc. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of Thr-58 by GSK-3 alters the subnuclear localization of c-Myc, enhancing its localization to discrete nuclear bodies. These observations may help to explain the increased oncogenicity associated with Thr-58 mutation of c-Myc. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells and COLO320 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, high glucose; Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (Hyclone). Daudi, PA687, and Wilson Burkitt's lymphoma cells (obtained from M. Zajac-Kaye, NCI, National Institutes of Health) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). Medium was supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For transfection, COS-7 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish the day prior to transfection and were transfected with 2–5 μg of the indicated plasmid by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (25Spotts G.D. Patel S.V. Xiao Q. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells were used for analysis 42–48 h later. Plasmids and Antibodies—Construction of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven murine c-myc expression plasmids, CMV-c-Myc2 (26Hann S.R. Dixit M. Sears R.C. Sealy L.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), have been described previously. The CMV-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged GSK-3 expression plasmids, CMV-GSK-3α-HA and GSK-3β–HA, were obtained from R. Wisdom (University of California, Davis, CA). The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal c-Myc antibodies, anti-MycFL (against full-length murine c-Myc) and avian-specific anti-av-Myc12C (against C-terminal avian c-Myc peptide), were generated as described previously (25Spotts G.D. Patel S.V. Xiao Q. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The c-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody C-33 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) was obtained from A. Reynolds (Vanderbilt University). The phosphospecific c-MycThr-58 antibody (anti-Myc58P) was generously provided by Upstate USA. The mouse monoclonal antibody to ubiquitin-protein conjugates (FK2) was purchased from Affiniti Research Products. The rabbit polyclonal antibody to human Ki67 antigen was purchased from Dako. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Cells were lysed in cold antibody lysis buffer (27Hann S.R. Abrams H.D. Rohrschneider L.R. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1983; 34: 789-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with 20 units/ml aprotinin (Sigma) followed by sonication. For radiolabeled cells, the amount of radiolabel incorporated into cellular proteins was determined by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts from each cellular lysate were adjusted to equal volumes with antibody buffer. For unlabeled cells, following lysis and sonication, equal amounts of total protein, as determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), were adjusted to equal volumes with antibody buffer. For coimmunoprecipitation analysis, cells were lysed in high stringency coimmunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 20 units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm Na3VO4) followed by brief sonication, and equal amounts of total protein were adjusted to equal volumes with high stringency coimmunoprecipitation buffer. Lysates were then precleared with Staphylococcus aureus membranes (Pansorbin; Calbiochem), clarified by centrifugation, and incubated with 2 μg of the indicated antibody for 1–2hat4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with Pansorbin for 20 min, washed three times with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (27Hann S.R. Abrams H.D. Rohrschneider L.R. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1983; 34: 789-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and incubated at 95 °C for 3 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography or Western blot analysis. For direct Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and equal amounts of lysate (100 μg total protein) were boiled for 3 min in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For Western blots, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell) followed by blocking in milk buffer (3% milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5) and incubation with the indicated primary antibody at 1–5 μg/ml in milk buffer overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed using Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and proteins were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:50,000 or sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:50,000, as appropriate, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence using Western Lightning reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Band intensities were measured by scanning densitometry of autoradiographs using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Pulse-Chase Analysis—Cells were treated with either 20 mm KCl or 20 mm LiCl, as indicated, for 30 min prior to pulse-chase. Cells were labeled with 200–500 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Trans35S-label; ICN Biomedicals) per 1 × 107 cells in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 10 min (pulse). The cells were then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and incubated in complete medium at 37° for the indicated amount of time (chase). Either 20 mm KCL or 20 mm LiCl was included in both the labeling and chase media. Cells were subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. Band intensities were measured by scanning densitometry (Quantity One; Bio-Rad) of autoradiographs. Phosphopeptide Mapping—Transfected COS-7 cells were labeled with 2 mCi of 32P-orthophosphate (ICN Biomedicals) per 1 × 107 cells in phosphate-free DMEM (Cellgro) containing 3% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 1 h. 32P-Labeled c-Myc was immunoprecipitated using anti-av-Myc12C, fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. c-Myc was digested off the membrane with 10 μg of thermolysin (Worthington), followed by performic acid oxidation and repeated lyophilization. The digested peptides were separated on thin layer cellulose plates (EM Science), in the first dimension by electrophoresis using a Hunter thin layer electrophoresis chamber in pH 1.9 buffer (1.5 kV, 20 min) and separated in the second dimension by ascending chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer (15 h) as described previously (23Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Transfected COS-7 cells were seeded on 1 × 25-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes in DMEM containing 10% calf serum ∼24 h after transfection. Approximately 18 h later, a time at which the cells were ∼50% confluent, coverslips were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Cells were permeabilized for 10 min using 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS and blocked for 15 min in 3% milk/PBS. Cells were incubated for 30 min with the indicated primary antibody at a dilution of 1–5 μg/ml. Cells were then incubated with the appropriate fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody, AlexaFluor488 goat anti-mouse IgG or AlexaFluor594 goat anti-rabbit IgG from Molecular Probes, at a dilution of 1:1000. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiophot inverted microscope equipped with a ×63 objective and the appropriate excitation filters from Chroma. Images were captured using a Princeton Instruments Micromax CCD digital camera and Electronic Photography software (Biological Detection, Inc.)

To determine whether GSK-3 activity is necessary for rapid c-Myc proteolysis in vivo, cells were treated with LiCl, which acts as a potent inhibitor of both mammalian GSK-3 isoforms (32Stambolic V.

Following treatment, pulse-chase analysis of c-Myc protein turnover was performed. As shown in Fig. 1, the half-life of c-Myc protein in COLO320 cells and in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Daudi, which express wild-type c-Myc (33Rabbitts T.H. Hamlyn P.H. Baer R. Nature. 1983; 306: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), was increased ∼2-fold by treatment with LiCl. However, LiCl treatment had no significant effect on the half-life of c-Myc in the Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, PA682 and Wilson (Fig. 1), which harbor mutations of c-Myc Thr-58 (34Niklinski J. Claassen G. Meyers C. Gregory M.A. Allegra C.J. Kaye F.J. Hann S.R. Zajac-Kaye M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5276-5284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results suggest that GSK-3 facilitates c-Myc proteolysis through Thr-58. As we have demonstrated previously that c-Myc proteolysis occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (10Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that GSK-3 enhances ubiquitination of c-Myc. To test this hypothesis, a c-Myc expression plasmid was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, together with empty vector or with a HA-tagged GSK-3 expression plasmid. To assess the extent of c-Myc ubiquitination, c-Myc was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates and subjected to Western blot analysis utilizing the monoclonal antibody FK2, which specifically recognizes ubiquitin-protein conjugates (35Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (upper panel), both GSK-3α and GSK-3β significantly increased the amount of wild-type c-Myc-ubiquitin conjugates detected but had no effect on c-Myc with a Thr-58 to Ala mutation (T58A). Prolonged film exposures reveal that ubiquitinated species of c-MycT58A are detectable (data not shown). Lysates were subjected to direct Western blot analysis to verify expression of c-Myc and GSK-3 (Fig. 2, middle panels). These data suggest that GSK-3 enhances the efficiency of c-Myc ubiquitination, likely through Thr-58 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr-58 by GSK-3—To initially address the question of whether GSK-3 phosphorylates Thr-58 of c-Myc in vivo, an antibody specific for Thr-58-phosphorylated c-Myc was utilized in Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 (lower panel), coexpression of either GSK-3α or GSK-3β significantly increased c-Myc reactivity with the phosphospecific antibody. The antibody showed no reactivity with c-MycT58A, verifying its specificity. To further confirm that GSK-3 controls Thr-58 phosphorylation, an additional technique, phosphopeptide mapping, was utilized. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with c-Myc and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence or absence of the GSK-3 inhibitor, LiCl. c-Myc was then immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates and subjected to two-dimensional thermolytic peptide mapping. Our previous mapping analysis (23Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) determined the migration positions of the c-Myc thermolytic peptides that contain single phosphorylation at Ser-62 (S62) and double phosphorylation at both Thr-58 and Ser-62 (T58/S62), indicated on the maps shown in Fig. 3. Because phosphorylation of Thr-58 requires prior phosphorylation of Ser-62, there is no peptide that contains phosphorylation at Thr-58 only (23Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 (upper left panel), the map of c-Myc from untreated cells reveals a high level of Thr-58/Ser-62 relative to Ser-62. Inhibition of GSK-3 by LiCl significantly increased Ser-62 relative to Thr-58/Ser-62 (Fig. 3, upper right panel). This is consistent with inhibition of Thr-58 phosphorylation, which leads to an increase in the amount of c-Myc phosphorylated at Ser-62 alone. Conversely, cotransfection of GSK-3α or GSK-3β with c-Myc caused disappearance of Ser-62 (Fig. 3, lower panels), suggesting that all c-Myc phosphorylated at Ser-62 alone has become additionally phosphorylated at Thr-58. Association of c-Myc with GSK-3 in Vivo and in Vitro—The results presented above argue that GSK-3 is likely the c-Myc Thr-58 kinase; however, they do not rule out the possibility that a kinase acting downstream of GSK-3 phosphorylates c-Myc Thr-58. Thus, we wanted to determine whether interaction between c-Myc and GSK-3 could be detected in vivo. To this end, c-Myc and GSK-3α GSK-3β were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and cellular lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-c-Myc, followed by Western blotting for the HA epitope on GSK-3. As shown in Fig. 4A (upper panel), GSK-3α (51 kDa) and GSK-3β (47 kDa) were observed in c-Myc immunoprecipitates derived from cells co-transfected with GSK-3 isoform and c-Myc but not from mock-transfected cells or from cells transfected with c-Myc or GSK-3 alone. In the inverse experiment, GSK-3 was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates using anti-HA, followed by Western blotting for c-Myc. Consistent with the results described above, c-Myc coprecipitated with both GSK-3α and GSK-3β when c-Myc was coexpressed (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Expression of c-Myc and GSK-3 was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4, A and B, lower panels). It is worth noting that the immunoprecipitations were performed under relatively stringent conditions (1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.05% SDS) indicating a strong interaction between c-Myc and GSK-3. These results, however, do not prove that c-Myc and GSK-3 interact directly, as the interaction could occur indirectly through an ancillary protein. To determine whether interaction between c-Myc and GSK-3 could occur in vitro, GSK-3α and/or c-Myc were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine, followed by immunoprecipitation of c-Myc. As shown in Fig. 4C, GSK-3α coprecipitated with c-Myc. Taken together, these results suggest that c-Myc directly binds to GSK-3 in vivo and that GSK-3 is the c-Myc Thr-58 kinase. We next wanted to examine what elements of the c-Myc protein are required for GSK-3 binding by using immunoprecipitation analysis. Thus, empty vector, full-length c-Myc, c-MycS, or one of several mutated versions of c-Myc was cotransfected into COS-7 cells with GSK-3α. GSK-3α was then immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates followed by Western blotting with anti-c-Myc. As shown in Fig. 4D (upper panel), c-MycS, which lacks the first 100 amino acids of c-Myc including highly conserved Myc Box I, failed to coprecipitate with GSK-3α, demonstrating that the first 100 amino acids are necessary for GSK-3 binding. Conversely, c-Mycd106–43, which is missing highly conserved Myc Box II, efficiently coprecipitated with GSK-3. Central and C-terminal c-Myc deletion mutants, with deletions covering amino acids 145–433, efficiently coprecipitated with GSK-3α (data not shown). Furthermore, GSK-3 was found to be capable of phosphorylating an N-terminal fragment consisting of the first 167 amino acids of c-Myc in vivo (data not shown), verifying that the N-terminal 167 amino acids of c-Myc are sufficient for recognition by GSK-3. These results suggest that the binding determinants for GSK-3 lie in the first 100 amino acids of c-Myc. It is reasonable to speculate that, because phosphorylation of c-Myc Thr-58 requires prior phosphorylation of Ser-62 (23Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), Ser-62 phosphorylation facilitates interaction with GSK-3. However, c-Myc with a Ser-62 to Ala (S62A) mutation efficiently coprecipitated with GSK-3α (Fig. 4D, upper panel). In fact, after normalization for c-Myc expression (lower panel), ∼2-fold more c-MycS62A coprecipitated with GSK-3 compared with wild-type c-Myc. This suggests Ser-62 phosphorylation is unimportant for GSK-3 binding. Similar to S62A, c-MycT58A efficiently coprecipitated with GSK-3α. This suggests that the effects of GSK-3 on c-Myc are not merely a consequence of GSK-3 binding to c-Myc but are because of phosphorylation of Thr-58. Regulation of c-Myc Localization to Nuclear Bodies by GSK-3— Phosphorylation by GSK-3 has been shown to affect the subcellular localization of proteins such as β-catenin (20Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) and cyclin D1 (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). To determine whether GSK-3 affects the subcellular localization of c-Myc, immunofluorescence analysis was performed on COS-7 cells cotransfected with c-Myc and empty vector or either GSK-3 isoform. As shown in Fig. 5A, two distinct c-Myc localization patterns were observed. In the first, c-Myc is evenly dispersed throughout the nucleus, excluding nucleoli (left panel). In the second, c-Myc is localized throughout the nucleus but is also concentrated in discrete nuclear bodies (right panel), generally one to four per cell. A very similar localization pattern was seen in live cells utilizing a green fluorescent protein-tagged c-Myc, indicating that the nuclear bodies observed are not artifacts of the immunostaining procedure (data not shown). Cotransfection with either GSK-3α or GSK-3β increased the number of cells in which c-Myc is localized to nuclear bodies (Fig. 5B). Conversely, a Thr-58 to Ala mutation dramatically reduced c-Myc localization to nuclear bodies (Fig. 5B), regardless of GSK-3 coexpression, resulting in a predominant nuclear disperse pattern (as in Fig. 5A, left panel). As c-Myc localized to nuclear bodies that are similar in appearance to nucleoli, we wanted to examine whether c-Myc colocalized with nucleolar markers. Thus, COS-7 cells transfected with"

Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar). Mevalonate-derived products include ubiquinone, heme, and the farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups that become attached to many proteins, directing them to membranes. HMG-CoA reductase is subject to tight regulation by a multivalent feedback mechanism mediated by nonsterol and sterol end products of mevalonate metabolism (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 2l: 505-5l7Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). These end products decrease reductase activity by inhibiting transcription of the reductase gene, blocking translation of the reductase mRNA, and accelerating degradation of the reductase protein. The transcriptional effects are mediated through the action of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), membrane-bound transcription factors that enhance transcription of genes encoding cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes and the low density lipoprotein receptor (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). The translational effects are mediated by nonsterol mevalonate-derived isoprenoids, which act by an undefined mechanism (4Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

The accelerated degradation of reductase is mediated both by sterols and nonsterol end products of mevalonate metabolism (4Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Hamster HMG-CoA reductase is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident glycoprotein of 887 amino acids and consists of two distinct domains (8Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 522-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain of 339 amino acids contains eight membrane spanning regions separated by short loops (9Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); it anchors the protein to ER membranes. The COOH-terminal domain of 548 amino acids projects into the cytoplasm and exerts all of the catalytic activity (8Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 522-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence indicate that the membrane domain is crucial for sterol-accelerated degradation of the enzyme: 1) the truncated cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain, expressed by transfection, retains full catalytic activity and exhibits a long half-life that is not shortened by sterols (10Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar); and 2) the transmembrane domain of reductase fused to soluble β-galactosidase exhibits sterol-regulated degradation in a manner similar to wild-type reductase (11Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sterol-accelerated degradation of reductase occurs in the ER and is blocked by inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome, which lead to the accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of the enzyme (6Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ravid T. Doolman R. Avner R. Harats D. Roitelman J. J. Biol.

A series of studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae support a role for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the control of HMG-CoA reductase degradation (12Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). HMG2p, one of two reductase isozymes expressed in yeast, undergoes accelerated degradation when flux through the mevalonate pathway is high (12Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 13Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Degradation of HMG2p is dependent upon a membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase complex that interacts with HMG2p and mediates its ubiquitination in response to degradative signals (14Gardner R.G. Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although accelerated degradation of mammalian reductase and that of yeast HMG2p seem similar, major differences exist. Although the membrane domain of yeast HMG2p includes multiple membrane spanning segments (13Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), it bears no primary sequence resemblance to that of mammalian reductase (8Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L.

Chem. 1985; 260: 10271-10277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, accelerated degradation of HMG2p in yeast is triggered maximally by a nonsterol isoprenoid (16Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), although maximal degradation of reductase in mammalian cells requires sterols plus nonsterol isoprenoids (4Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent clues to the mechanism of degradation of mammalian HMG-CoA reductase have emerged from the study of the transcriptional axis of sterol regulation as mediated by SREBPs. The key discovery was SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a polytopic membrane protein that resembles the reductase by virtue of eight membrane spanning segments. SCAP is a sterol-responsive escort protein that forms a complex with SREBPs and escorts them from the ER to the Golgi where SREBPs are proteolytically released from membranes, thereby allowing transcriptionally active fragments to enter the nucleus where they activate the reductase gene (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar, 17DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.-P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J.

Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Sterols block SREBP activation by preventing the exit of SCAP-SREBP complexes from the ER, leading to decreased synthesis of cholesterol and other lipids. The block in SREBP export is achieved through sterol-induced binding of SCAP to one of a pair of ER retention proteins called Insig-1 and Insig-2 (19Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The binding site for Insig in SCAP has been localized to a ∼170-amino acid segment that comprises transmembrane segments 2–6. These segments show significant sequence similarities to helices 2–6 of the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase, and this region has been termed the sterol-sensing domain (21Hua X. Nohturfft A.

The resemblance between the sterol-sensing domains of SCAP and HMG-CoA reductase led us to test the possible role of Insig-1 in the sterol-regulated degradation of the reductase (26Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). When reductase is overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the enzyme is no longer degraded rapidly in response to sterol treatment. Overexpression of Insig-1 restores regulated degradation of overexpressed reductase, and this degradation can be inhibited by overexpressing the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP, suggesting that reductase and SCAP compete for limiting amounts of Insig when sterol levels are high. Although both proteins bind to Insig-1, the binding leads to markedly different consequences: binding leads to ER retention of SCAP and to accelerated degradation of reductase. How Insigs orchestrate seemingly discordant modes of cellular regulation requires further knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the sterol-mediated effects on reductase and SCAP. In this paper, we explore the role of Insigs, sterols, and nonsterol isoprenoids in regulating degradation of reductase.

Lysine mutations (K89R, K248R, and K89R/K248R) and sterol sensing-domain mutations (Y75A, Y77A, Y75A/Y77A, I76A, F78A, I76A/F78A, and YIYF-(75–78) to AAAA) in pCMV-HMG-Red-T7 and pCMV-HMG-Red-T7(TM1–8) were generated with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The integrity of all plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing of their open reading frames and ligation joints. Cell Culture—Monolayers of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were maintained in tissue culture at 37 °C in 8–9% CO2. Stock cultures of CHO-K1 cells were maintained in medium A (1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). Monolayers of SV-589 cells, an immortalized line of human fibroblasts expressing the SV40 large T antigen (30Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Stock cultures of SV-589 cells were maintained in medium B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% FCS. SV589/pMev cells are derivatives of SV-589 cells stably expressing pMev, a cDNA encoding a mutated monocarboxylate transporter that confers efficient uptake of mevalonate from tissue culture medium (28Kim C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23113-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SV-589/pMev cells were generated as follows. On day 0, SV-589 cells were set up at 2 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish in medium B supplemented with 10% FCS. On day 1, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of pRc/CMV7S-Mev using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described below. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were switched to selection medium that consisted of medium B supplemented with 10% LPDS, 50 μm sodium compactin, 200 μm sodium mevalonate, and 700 μg/ml G418. Fresh medium was added every 2–3 days until colonies formed after about 10 days. Individual colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders, and pMev expression was assessed by the ability of exogenous mevalonate to induce reductase degradation. Once stably transfected cell lines were established, they were each maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in medium B containing 10% LPDS, 50 μm sodium compactin, 200 μm sodium mevalonate, and 500 μg/ml G418. Sterols were added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 0.1 or 0.2% (v/v) ethanol. Transient Transfection, Cell Fractionation, and Immunoblot Analysis—Transfections were performed as described (31Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

For each transfection, FuGENE 6 DNA transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) was added to 0.2 ml of medium A at a ratio of 3 μl of FuGENE-6 per 1 μg of DNA. Conditions of incubation are described in the figure legends. At the end of the incubation, dishes of cells were harvested and pooled for analysis. Pooled cell pellets were used to isolate either nuclear extracts, 2 × 104-g membrane fractions (26Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol.

On day 2, the cells were transfected as described in the legend to Fig. 5, after which they were harvested for preparation of a 1.6 × 104-g membrane pellet, which was solubilized with 1% (w/v) digitonin and centrifuged as described (19Yang T.

A second aliquot of the 20,000 × g supernatant was mixed with SDS-containing buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. RNA Interference—The protocol was adapted from Elbashir et al. (33Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Duplexes of small-interfering RNA (siRNA) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). siRNA sequences targeting human Insig-1 and human Insig-2 (GenBank™ accession numbers AY112745 and AF527632, respectively) corresponded to the following nucleotide positions relative to the first nucleotides of the start codons, respectively: Insig-1, 691–711; and Insig-2, 324–344. The siRNA sequence targeting an irrelevant control gene, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), was reported (34Moon Y.-A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7335-7343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). On day 0, SV-589 cells were set up at a density of 5 × 104 cells per 60-mm dish in medium B supplemented with 10% FCS. On day 1, the cells were transfected with siRNA using a ratio of 6 μl of OligofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen) to 400 pmol of siRNA duplexes per dish as described by the manufacturer. Cells were washed once with 2 ml of medium B (without antibiotics) and refed with 1.6 ml of medium B (without antibiotics). The siRNA/OligofectAMINE mixture (in a total volume of 0.4 ml) was added to each dish and incubated at 37 °C. After 6 h, the cells received a direct addition of 1 ml of medium B containing (final concentrations) 10% FCS, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 1 mm sodium mevalonate, and 20 μm sodium oleate, and were then incubated at 37 °C. On day 3, the cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes as described above. Six hours after the final transfection, the cells received a direct addition of 1 ml of medium B containing (final concentration) 10% LPDS, 50 μm sodium compactin, and 50 μm sodium mevalonate. On day 4, the cells were treated as described in the figure legends, and harvested for analysis. Real-time PCR—The protocol was identical to that described by Liang et al (35Liang G. Yang J.

Immunoprecipitation of labeled reductase was carried out with 30 μg of a polyclonal antibody directed against the 60-kDa COOH-terminal domain of human reductase (36Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9261-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose filters. Dried filters were exposed to an imaging plate at room temperature and scanned in a Fuji X Bas 1000 Phosphorimager. Ubiquitination of HMG-CoA Reductase—Conditions of incubations are described in the figure legends. At the end of the incubation, cells were harvested, and immunoprecipitations with either polyclonal antibody against endogenous human reductase (see above) or monoclonal anti-T7 IgG-coupled agarose beads (Novagen) against transfected reductase were carried out as described (26Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) with two modifications: the lysis buffer used to harvest the cells was supplemented with 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide and the pelleted beads were washed three times (30 min each). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5–12% gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The experiment in Fig. 1 was designed to examine the relationship between ubiquitination and sterol-accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. SV589 cells, a line of SV-40-transformed human fibroblasts, were depleted of sterols by incubation for 16 h in LPDS containing the reductase inhibitor, compactin, and a low level of mevalonate (50 μm), which is the lowest level that assures viability. Cells were then treated for either 2 or 5 h with a mixture of sterols (1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μg/ml cholesterol) and a high concentration of mevalonate (10 mm) in various combinations.

https://openalex.org/W2017066841,"Despite a central circadian role in Drosophila for the transcriptional regulator Timeless (dTim), the relevance of mammalian Timeless (mTim) remains equivocal. Conditional knockdown of mTim protein expression in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) disrupted SCN neuronal activity rhythms, and altered levels of known core clock elements. Full-length mTim protein (mTIM-fl) exhibited a 24-hour oscillation, where as a truncated isoform (mTIM-s) was constitutively expressed. mTIM-fl associated with the mammalian clock Period proteins (mPERs) in oscillating SCN cells. These data suggest that mTim is required for rhythmicity and is a functional homolog of dTim on the negative-feedback arm of the mammalian molecular clockwork."
https://openalex.org/W2024936138,"Activity of heterologously expressed NKCC1 was analyzed under basal and activated conditions in the presence and absence of binding of Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK). Mutant NKCC1 that lacks the ability to bind to this kinase showed K+ transport function identical to wild-type NKCC1. Thus, preventing the binding of the kinase to the cotransporter does not affect cotransporter function. In contrast, several experiments suggest a possible role for SPAK as a scaffolding protein. First, Western blot analysis revealed the presence, and in some tissues abundance, of truncated forms of SPAK and OSR1 in which the kinase domains are affected and thus lack kinase activity. Second, a yeast two-hybrid screen of proteins that interact with the regulatory (binding) domain of SPAK identified several proteins all involved in cellular stress pathways. Third, p38, one of the three major MAPKs, can be coimmunoprecipitated with SPAK and with NKCC1 in an activity-dependent manner. The amount of p38 coimmunoprecipitated with the kinase and the cotransporter significantly decreases upon cellular stress, whereas the interaction of the kinase with NKCC1 remains unchanged.

These findings suggest that cation-chloride cotransporters might act as “sensors” for cellular stress, and SPAK, by interacting with the cotransporter, serves as an intermediate in the response to cellular stress. Cation-chloride cotransporters, which mediate the tightly coupled, electroneutral movement of cations (Na+ and K+) together with Cl–, can be divided into Na+-dependent transporters, such as Na-K-2Cl cotransporters (NKCC1–2) and the Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC), and Na+-independent K-Cl cotransporters (KCC1–4). All of these transporters have a well conserved topology with large intracellular amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal tails and 12 transmembrane spanning domains. The core protein shares some homology to amino acid permeases (for reviews see Refs. 1Delpire E. Mount D.B. Annu. Rev.

At the molecular level, the activation-deactivation of these cotransporters mostly involves phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms, the details of which are still the subject of intense investigation. To identify proteins that directly interact and regulate cation-chloride cotransporters, we recently performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the cytosolic amino-terminal tail of KCC3. We identified two closely related kinases that bind to KCC3, NKCC1 and NKCC2 (13Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These kinases belong to the group of Ste20 kinases that function as regulators of MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMAP2microtubule-associated protein 2PVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridePBSphosphate-buffered salineGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinAATYKapoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase. cascades (14Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The first kinase, SPAK (Ste-20 related proline-alanine-rich kinase, or PASK, as the rat homologue), is highly expressed in epithelia and neurons (15Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Its gene is located on human chromosome 2q31.1. The second kinase, OSR1, which is named based on a 30% homology to an oxidative stress response kinase, has much higher homology to SPAK (67%). The OSR1 gene is located on human chromosome 3p22-p21.3 (16Tamari M. Daigo Y. Nakamura Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There are orthologues of OSR1 in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. Inactivation of the Drosophila ortholog, fray, results in a phenotype with axonal ensheathment deficits (17Leiserson W.M. Harkins E.W. Keshishian H. Neuron. 2000; 28: 793-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). mitogen-activated protein kinase microtubule-associated protein 2 polyvinylidene difluoride phosphate-buffered saline glial fibrillary acidic protein apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase. The catalytic (kinase) domains of SPAK and OSR1 are located at the amino terminus, and the regulatory domains are at the carboxyl terminus (14Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the binding with cation-chloride cotransporters takes place at the extreme carboxyl termini of SPAK and OSR1 (13Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The two kinases bind to peptides with a minimum of 9 residues with the following initial consensus sequence: (R/K)FX(V/I). This motif was found twice in the amino terminus of NKCC1, and each sequence was shown to interact with the kinases. Recently, Dowd and Forbush (18Dowd B.F. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27347-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) proposed a regulatory role of SPAK (PASK) on the activity of NKCC1. They showed that overexpression of a dominant negative PASK (inactive kinase) resulted in a lack of activation of NKCC1 upon lowering the intracellular Cl–. They also demonstrated that inactive SPAK failed to phosphorylate NKCC1 upon activation. Whether or not the kinase directly phosphorylated and activated the cotransporter still remains unclear. In the present study, we show that preventing the interaction of SPAK and OSR1 with NKCC1 fails to influence the activity of the cotransporter under basal or activated conditions. Our results therefore suggest that binding of the kinase to the two SPAK binding domain is not required for NKCC1 activation. We demonstrate that SPAK, besides colocalizing with cation-chloride cotransporters, interacts with additional proteins that are involved in the response of the cell to stress. Furthermore, we show that the ability of SPAK to coimmunoprecipitate p38 changes upon extracellular stress. Thus, we propose that the kinase serves as a scaffolding protein, gathering stress-response proteins in the vicinity of the cotransporters. NKCC1 Function in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—The open reading frame of the mouse NKCC1 (3.7 kb) was ligated into pBF, a vector suitable for expression in amphibian oocytes. The cDNA was linearized with MluI and transcribed into cRNA using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 transcription system from Ambion. cRNA was quantitated by measurement of its absorbance at 260 nm, and its quality was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% agarose, 0.693% formaldehyde). A small NarI-NcoI fragment was subcloned into the vector pBluescript (pBSK+) for site-directed mutagenesis. Complementary sense and antisense oligonucleotides containing specific mutations were synthesized and used to amplify the subclone inserted in pBSK+ (QuikChange, Stratagene). The parental DNA was digested with DpnI, a restriction enzyme that recognizes and cleaves methylated GATC sequence. After DpnI treatment, a 1-μl aliquot of the PCR was transformed into Escherichia coli. Several clones were isolated and sequenced between NarI and NcoI to verify proper sequence and mutation. The fragment was then re-inserted into the original NKCC1 clone in pBF and transcribed. Stages V–VI X. laevis oocytes were isolated as described previously (19Strange K. Singer T.D. Morrison R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C860-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained at 16 °C in modified L15 medium (Leibovitz's L15 solution diluted with water to a final osmolarity of 195–200 mosm and supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and 44 μg of gentamicin). Oocytes were injected the following day with 27.5 ng of cRNA. 86Rb uptakes were performed 3 days post-injection. Groups of 20 oocytes were washed once with 3 ml of isosmotic saline (96 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) and preincubated for 20 min in 1 ml of isosmotic saline containing 1 mm ouabain. The solution was then aspirated and replaced with isosmotic or hyperosmotic solutions complemented with 2–5 μCi of 86Rb. The composition of the hyperosmotic solution was identical to the isosmotic solution but with an additional 50 mm sucrose. Two aliquots of 5 μl of flux solution were sampled at the beginning of the uptake and used as standards. After 1 h of uptake, the radioactive solution was aspirated, and the oocytes were washed 4 times with 3 ml of ice-cold isosmotic or hypertonic solution. Preliminary experiments have shown that the flux is linear over a 3-h period. NKCC1 flux is expressed in picomoles of K+/oocyte/h. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test and analysis of variance. Surface Expression of NKCC1 in X. laevis Oocytes—Groups of 20 oocytes were injected with 27.5 ng of wild-type NKCC1 or deletion mutant NKCC1 cRNA and kept at 16 °C for 3–4 days in modified L15 medium. Then, oocytes were washed with isosmotic saline (see above) and incubated for 1 h in 1 ml of isosmotic saline containing 1 mm EZ-link sulfo-NHS biotin (Pierce). After the incubation period, oocytes were washed three times with 3 ml of isosmotic saline and lysed (20 μl/oocyte) in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Lysis was achieved by incubating the oocytes for 10 min on ice in the lysis buffer, followed by trituration with a pipette, an additional 15 min of incubation on ice, and a final centrifugation step of 15,000 × g for 15 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was saved for protein assay (Bradford, BioRad), and an equal amount of protein sample was diluted with lysis buffer to a final volume of 1 ml. Streptavidin (50 μl) was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle rotation. The samples were then spun and washed three times. After the final wash, streptavidin beads were resuspended into 65 μl of sample buffer containing 4% β-mercaptoethanol, heated at 50 °C for 20 min, and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Preparation of an OSR1-specific Antibody—Alignment of SPAK and OSR1 proteins reveals a small region within the carboxyl terminus with very low amino acid conservation (9% identity, see Fig. 1A of our previous publication (13Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)). Thus, we selected a small fragment within that particular region to create an OSR1-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody. A 74-amino acid peptide (residues 363–436) of the mouse OSR1 was PCR-amplified from IMAGE clone 5341146 and fused to glutathione S-transferase. The fusion protein was grown in E. coli and purified with glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads. Polyclonal antibodies were produced by subcutaneous injections of the entire fusion protein into two New Zealand White rabbits (Covance, Denver, PA). The antiserum from the last production bleed was affinity-purified as described previously (20Pearson M. Lu J. Mount D.B. Delpire E. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 483-493Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The binding domain of SPAK to cationchloride cotransporters (amino acids 461–556) was amplified by PCR from mouse IMAGE clone 2135848 using a sense primer containing an EcoRI site and an antisense primer containing a stop codon, followed by a BamHI site. The fragment was then ligated downstream of the Gal4 binding domain in pGBDUc2 (yeast two-hybrid vector) and transformed into PJ69-4A cells (21James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SPAK-containing yeast cells were subsequently transformed with a mouse brain library in pACTII (Clontech), and a total number of 18.9 × 106 clones were screened as described previously (13Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To test for interaction between SPAK and the amino terminus of NKCC1, the entire amino terminus of the cotransporter was PCR-amplified and ligated into pGBDUc2. For the mutants, NarI-SacI fragments were isolated from full-length NKCC1 mutants in pBF and exchanged with the wild-type NarI-SacI fragment in pGBDUc2. Immunofluorescence—Two adult C57BL6 mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with ice-cold PBS for 5 min and with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min. Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2–4 h at 4 °C. Brains were then incubated in 30% sucrose for 24–48 h at 4 °C. After cutting 10-μm sections and thaw-mounting them on Superfrost Plus slides, sections were air-dried for 1 h and stored at –80 °C. For immunolabeling, slides were warmed up on a 37 °C heating plate and further processed as described previously (22Lu J. Karadsheh M. Delpire E. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 558-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were permeabilized in 1% SDS in PBS containing 8% β-mercaptoethanol, blocked with PBS, 1% bovine serum, 4% goat serum (blocking solution), and incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution containing SPAK-purified polyclonal antibody (1:200; for preparation of SPAK-specific antibody see Ref. 13Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). After washing in high salt PBS and PBS and blocking in blocking solution, sections were exposed to the secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG); Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:1600 for 1 h. After washing in high salt PBS and PBS, sections were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For double labeling experiments, sections coming out of the washing steps were blocked in blocking solution and then incubated at 4 °C overnight at a concentration of 1:200 with either anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; ICN clone GA-5) to identify astrocytes or anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2; clone A20, Roche Applied Science) to identify neurons. These antibodies were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1600; Jackson ImmunoResearch). The same protocol as for single labeling was used. We have demonstrated recently (13Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) the specificity of the SPAK antibody by Western blot analysis. As negative controls, immunolabeling of adjacent sections was performed omitting the first antibody, or both antibodies. The latter revealed a punctate staining in the cytosol of some cells, which we just excluded as a sign for a SPAK-positive structure. Sections were analyzed on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope equipped with a Photometrics CoolsnapCf CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) connected to a G4 Apple computer. Tissue Distribution Analysis—Tissues from two adult C57BL6 mice were promptly isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen. One gram of tissue was homogenized in 10 ml of solution sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA) with a Teflon pestle. The homogenates were spun at 3000 rpm for 20 min, 9000 rpm for 20 min, and 32,000 rpm for 45 min. The high speed pellet consisting of microsomal protein was resuspended in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 2 mm EDTA. After protein quantitation using a Bio-Rad Bradford assay, equal amounts of protein were denatured, resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Mouse brains (∼400–500 mg) were dissected on ice and cut sagitally into two halves. The first half was homogenized promptly in 5 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.2), and protease inhibitors) with a Teflon pestle and kept on ice, and the second half was cut into small chunks and incubated in oxygenated aCSF for 30 min. The composition of aCSF was as follows (in mm): 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 17 sucrose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Because the thickness of the chunks prevents oxygen diffusion, the brain tissue becomes ischemic as demonstrated by the 10–20-fold activation of phospho-p38. After incubation, the chunks were homogenized in lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min. Brain homogenates were then centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was recovered. Coimmunoprecipitations were performed by incubating 1 ml of brain lysate aliquots with 10–20 μl of immunopurified antibodies (rabbit polyclonal NKCC1 (23Kaplan M.R. Plotkin M.D. Brown D. Hebert S.C. Delpire E. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), SPAK (13Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), p38 against residues 341–360 of human p38 MAPK (from Calbiochem), and mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-p38 MAPK Thr-180/Tyr-182 (Cell Signaling), under gentle rotation, overnight at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 30 μl of protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. After three washes in lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitate-agarose beads complexes were resuspended in loading buffer and denatured at 50 °C for 20 min. After brief centrifugation, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (TBST, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Tween 20 [polyoxyethylene-sorbitan monolaurate]). Membranes were then subjected to affinity-purified NKCC1, SPAK antibodies (1:1000) in TBST, 5% non-fat dry milk overnight at 4 °C, washed extensively in TBST, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking solution (1:4000). After extensive washing, protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). NKCC1 Mutants—As indicated in Fig. 1, two SPAK binding domains can be found in the amino terminus of NKCC1. The first domain, RFQVDPESV, is located 76 residues downstream of the start methionine. The second motif, RFRVNFDPA, is located 48 residues downstream of the first motif and overlaps with a putative PP1-binding motif (24Darman R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). By using the yeast two-hybrid method, we demonstrated that these two minimal motifs constitute sites of interaction with the kinases SPAK and OSR1 (13Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated previously that mutations of the phenylalanine residue at position 2 or the valine residue at position 4 to alanine completely abolished the interaction. Note that the SPAK/OSR1-binding sites are located far upstream of the threonine residue (Thr-211 for mouse NKCC1) essential for transport (25Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). By using site-directed mutagenesis, we produced several NKCC1 mutants and tested their function in X. laevis oocytes. The first mutant inactivates the first SPAK binding domain by replacing the Phe residue with Ala. Fig. 2A shows that this manipulation did not affect NKCC1 function, as measured as 86Rb+ fluxes in isotonic (195 mosm) or hypertonic (265 mosm) solutions. For the second mutant, we mutated RV into AA, a mutation that prevents SPAK interaction and also affects PP1 binding (24Darman R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This second manipulation also failed to affect NKCC1 transport activity, which was in this case assessed in isotonic, hypertonic, and low Cl– conditions (Fig. 2B). Because the binding of SPAK to a single motif might be sufficient to regulate NKCC1, we created a double mutant (Phe → Ala and RV → AA mutations in the first and second motif, respectively). When SPAK interaction with NKCC1 is prevented, the fluxes in isotonic, hypertonic, and low Cl– are still identical to the ones obtained with wild-type NKCC1 (Fig. 2C). To confirm that the double mutant results in a loss of SPAK-cotransporter interaction, we performed separate yeast two-hybrid tests with SPAK and the wild-type NKCC1-NT, the two single mutants, and the double mutant. As shown in Fig. 3, all clones but the double mutant showed interaction with the stress kinase. In contrast to the double mutant, a deletion of a large fragment containing both SPAK/OSR1 binding domains as well as a long polyalanine stretch inbetween significantly reduced NKCC1 activity (60% decrease) under isotonic, hypertonic, and low Cl– conditions. However, the percent activation by hypertonicity and low Cl– compared with wild type was unchanged (Fig. 2D). To assess whether the observed overall decrease in NKCC1 activity results from a decrease in NKCC1 trafficking, we injected groups of 20 oocytes with wild-type NKCC1 and deletion mutant NKCC1. Three days post-transfection, the oocytes were biotinylated, washed, and lysed. Western blot analysis of biotinylated protein (surface protein) with NKCC1 antibody revealed a higher number of cotransporter in the membrane for the mutant cotransporter, compared with wild-type NKCC1 (see Fig. 4). Effects of the single and double mutations were also tested while coexpressing mouse SPAK cDNA in X. laevis oocytes to ensure that the level of endogenous OSR1 is not a limiting factor. As with the uptakes shown in Fig. 2, there were no significant differences between the activity of mutants and wild-type NKCC1 proteins in SPAK coexpressing oocytes (data not shown). These data indicate that preventing SPAK/OSR1 interaction with NKCC1 by preventing the binding has no effect on NKCC1 transport activity. Therefore, our data point to a function for SPAK/OSR1 interaction with NKCC1, other than modulation of cotransporter activity.Fig. 2Activity of NKCC1 and NKCC1 mutants in X. laevis oocytes.A, comparison between water-, NKCC1-, and NKCC1[F>A]-injected oocytes incubated in isotonic (gray bars) or hypertonic (black bars) solutions. B, comparison between NKCC1- and NKCC1[RV>AA]-injected oocytes incubated in isotonic, hypertonic, or low internal Cl– (white bars) conditions. C, comparison between water-, NKCC1-, and NKCC1 double mutant-injected oocytes incubated in isotonic, hypertonic, or low internal Cl– conditions. D, K+ uptakes in wild-type and deletion mutant NKCC1 measured in isotonic, hypertonic, or low internal Cl– conditions. a and b, K+ uptake in NKCC1-injected oocytes is significantly different from the one measured in water-injected oocytes (analysis of variance between isosmotic conditions: p < 0.001); c, K+ flux in deletion mutant is significantly smaller than in wild type (t test, p < 0.0001). Fluxes are expressed in pmol of K+ per oocyte per h. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E. (n = 20 oocytes). Each panel represents a typical experiment, and each experiment was repeated at least once. Absolute K+ uptake values vary from experiment to experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Effect of NKCC1 mutations on SPAK binding, as revealed by yeast two-hybrid analysis.A, the positive interaction between SPAK and the amino terminus of NKCC1 promotes growth of the yeast in plates lacking histidine, leucine, and uracil and containing 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.

Biotinylated (surface) proteins were isolated using streptavidin beads and separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Experiment was repeated once with identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tissue Distribution of SPAK and OSR1—The tissue distribution of OSR1 and SPAK was examined by Western blot analysis using an OSR1-specific polyclonal antibody and a SPAK polyclonal antibody (13Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, SPAK and OSR1 are expressed in all tissues examined, with the exception of the salivary gland that failed to show OSR1 immunoreactivity. Several observations can be made from this tissue distribution. 1) both SPAK- and OSR1-specific antibodies react with two major bands: a band of ∼50 kDa molecular size and a larger band of ∼60 kDa. 2) The high SPAK band is generally more abundant than the lower SPAK band, and the reverse is observed for OSR1 with the lower molecular weight band frequently being more abundant than the higher one. 3) Tissues such as brain, testis, stomach, and salivary gland express SPAK in higher abundance than lung, kidney, liver, muscle, and heart. In contrast, the tissues with highest OSR1 protein were lung, muscle, and testis when compared with brain, kidney, stomach, heart, and salivary gland. The predicted molecular size of OSR1 (58.3 kDa, 527 residues) is smaller than the calculated molecular size of SPAK (60.3 kDa, 556 residues). To establish that the presence of two major reactive bands observed on Western blots with the SPAK and OSR antibodies is not due to antibody cross-reactivity, we separated kidney proteins on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto nylon membrane, and cut the membrane right in the middle of the loaded lane.

https://openalex.org/W2136749710,"A reduction in L-arginine availability has been implicated in the impairment of endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). However, the mechanisms contributing to dysregulation of the L-arginine pool remain unknown. Because endothelial cells can metabolize L-arginine via two major enzymes, that is, NO synthase (NOS) and arginase, we hypothesized that up-regulation of arginase during I/R reduces L-arginine availability to NOS and thus impairs NO-mediated vasodilation. To test this hypothesis, a local I/R was produced in the porcine heart by occlusion of a small branch of left anterior descending artery for 30 min, followed by reperfusion for 90 min. Arterioles (60-110 microm) isolated from non-ischemic and ischemic regions of subepicardium were cannulated and pressurized without flow for in vitro study. Vessels from both regions developed similar levels of basal tone. Although the dilation of I/R vessels to endothelium-independent agonist sodium nitroprusside was not altered, the endothelium-dependent NO-mediated dilations to adenosine and serotonin were attenuated. I/R not only inhibited arteriolar production of NO but also increased arteriolar arginase activity. Arginase inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine enhanced NO production/dilation in normal vessels and also restored the NO-mediated function in I/R vessels. Treating I/R vessels with L-arginine also restored vasodilations. Immunohistochemical data revealed that I/R up-regulated arginase but down-regulated NOS expression in the arteriolar endothelium. Pretreating the animals with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prevented I/R-induced arginase up-regulation and also preserved NO-mediated vascular function. These results suggest that one mechanism by which I/R inhibits NO-mediated arteriolar dilation is through increased arginase activity, which limits the availability of L-arginine to NOS for NO production. In addition, the inability of arginase blockade or L-arginine supplementation to completely restore vasodilatory function may be attributable to the down-regulation of endothelial NOS expression."
https://openalex.org/W2099270619,"Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 are increased in human choroidal neovascularization (CNV) occurring during the exudative most aggressive form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but their precise role and potential interactions remain unclear. To address the question of MMP-2 and MMP-9 functions, mice deficient in the expression of MMP-2 (MMP-2 KO), MMP-9 (MMP-9 KO), and both MMP-2 and MMP-9 (MMP-2,9 KO) with their corresponding wild-type mice (WT) underwent CNV induction by laser-induced rupture of the Bruch's membrane. Both the incidence and the severity of CNV were strongly attenuated in double deficient compared with single gene deficient mice or corresponding WT controls. The reduced neovascularization was accompanied by fibrinogen/fibrin accumulation. Furthermore, overexpression of the endogenous MMP inhibitors TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 (delivered by adenoviral vectors) in WT mice or daily injection of a synthetic and gelatinase selective MMP inhibitor (Ro 26-2853) significantly decreased the pathological reaction. These findings suggest that MMP-2 and MMP-9 may cooperate in the development of AMD and that their selective inhibition represents an alternative strategy for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W1987556650,"Modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) plays an important role in the function, compartmentalization, and stability of target proteins, contributing to the regulation of diverse processes. SUMO-1 modification can be regulated not only at the level of conjugation; it may also be reversed by a class of proteases known as the SUMO-specific proteases. However, current understanding of the regulation, specificity, and function of these proteases remains limited. In this study, we characterize aspects of the compartmentalization and proteolytic activity of the mammalian SUMO-specific protease, SENP1, providing insight into its function and regulation. We demonstrate the presence of a single nonconsensus nuclear localization signal within the N terminus of the protein, the mutation of which results in pronounced cytoplasmic accumulation in contrast to the nuclear accumulation of the parental protein. In addition, we observe that the N terminus of the protein may be essential for the correct regulation of the protease, since expression of the core domain alone results in limited expression and loss of SUMO-1, indicative of constitutive catalytic activity. Consistent with the prediction that the protease is a member of the cysteine family of proteases, we mutated a key cysteine residue and observed that expression of this catalytic mutant had a dominant negative phenotype, resulting in the accumulation of high molecular weight SUMO-1 conjugates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SENP1 may itself be a target for SUMO-1 modification occurring at a nonconsensus site. Finally, we demonstrate that SENP1 localization is influenced by expression and localization of SUMO-1-conjugated target proteins within the cell.

Post-translation modification of proteins plays a crucial role in altering protein function, localization, and turnover. Modification includes not only chemical modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation but also the conjugation of proteins to target substrates. Ubiquitination is a well studied example whereby ubiquitin is covalently coupled to the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues on particular target proteins. Although ubiquitination is generally regarded to target a protein for degradation, it is now clear that certain types of ubiquitin modifications may have other regulatory effects (for a review, see Ref. 1.Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A further class of post-translational modification that has attracted considerable attention is the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like proteins. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO-1) 1The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; NLS, nuclear localization signal; WT, wild type; HDAC, histone deacetylase; BES, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; aa, amino acids; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. modification, unlike ubiquitination, does not target a protein for degradation and in some circumstances may function to antagonize protein degradation. Moreover, SUMO-1 modification has itself been shown to be an important strategy for the regulation of protein function, with many key proteins, including PML, p53, Ik-Bα, and c-Jun, now shown to be targets for SUMO-1 regulation (2.Müller S.

SUMO-1 is conjugated to proteins through a pathway that shares many similarities to that of ubiquitin (for a review, see Ref. 6.Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Significant progress on understanding the SUMO-1 conjugation system has been made during the past few years, and several key proteins involved in the pathway have been identified (7.Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 8.Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SUMO-1 conjugation involves the utilization of ATP to adenylate the carboxyl terminus of a processed form of SUMO-1, which is then transferred to a cysteine residue in the E1 enzyme complex (SAE1-SAE2) and then to a cysteine residue in the E2 enzyme Ubch9 (7.Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, although SUMO proteins can be transferred from the Ubch9 complex directly to some target proteins in vitro, a number of SUMO E3 enzymes such as Ran-BP2 and the PIAS family of proteins have recently been identified (10.Johnson E.S.

These components enhance the conjugation reaction and are likely to provide substrate specificity in the transfer of the SUMO-1 moiety to the ϵ-lysine group of specific target proteins. The covalent modification of proteins by SUMO-1 is reversible and is mediated by SUMO-specific proteases. These proteases are thought to have dual roles. They are responsible first for the initial processing of SUMO-1 by cleavage of the precursor peptide at the carboxyl terminus of the protein, generating a C-terminal diglycine motif, and second for the subsequent processing and cleavage of high molecular weight SUMO-1 conjugates, releasing SUMO-1 and reducing the conjugation status of the target proteins. A number of SUMO-specific proteases have been predicted based on homology to the first identified protease yeast Ulp1, the Smt3 (SUMO-1 homologue) deconjugating enzyme (15.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), and are thought to be members of the general family of cysteine proteases. Those that have been studied to date include two proteases in yeast, Ulp1 and Ulp2 (15.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 16.Li S.J.

A number of other proteins predicted to be SUMO-specific proteases have been proposed based on homology within of a core domain (15.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 23.Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), but functional activity in SUMO-1 processing has not been shown. The proteases identified thus far possess some interesting features. They all contain a core domain within which are the conserved amino acids (cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid) that make up the catalytic triad. In addition, the proteases possess a large N-terminal domain, with little conservation between the members. It is noteworthy that the subcellular localization of a number of the proteases has been reported to be different, suggesting that this may be an important factor in the regulation and specificity of the proteases. Despite this progress, however, our understanding of the proteases and their regulation remains limited. We have previously reported that a SUMO-1-specific protease, SENP1, co-localizes with a herpesvirus protein ICP0 during early infection and proposed that this colocalization may be involved in the ICP0-induced loss of SUMO-1-modified PML in infected cells (24.Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we report further characterization of the localization and regulation of SENP1. We map a basic motif within the N terminus of the protein that is critical for efficient nuclear localization of SENP1 and show that the N-terminal region may also be important in modulating SENP1 activity. We show that alteration of a single cysteine residue within the predicted catalytic core inactivates SENP1, resulting in a dominant negative effect and accumulation of SUMO-1-conjugated species tightly associated with the inactive SENP1. Interestingly, our results also indicate that the protease may itself be a target for SUMO-1 modification. We further demonstrate that SENP1 localization may also be influenced by the expression of proteins that are targets of SUMO-1 modification, such as HDAC4 and PML, which affect the relative levels and localization of SUMO-1 conjugates within the cell. Cells—HEp2 and COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Construction and selection of HEp2-SUMO and HeLa-SUMO cell lines has been recently described (24.Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing SUMO-1 were selected and passaged in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Construction of Plasmids—The construction of the FLAG epitope-tagged wild type (WT) SENP1 construct and the epitope-tagged SUMO-1 expression vector have been previously described (24.Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additional mutants and deletion variants of SENP1 were constructed using PCR mutagenesis, by overlapping PCR, or by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene). The SENP1 NLS1 mutant containing the additional SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) (PKKKRK) was constructed by annealing two oligonucleotides (ctagcccaaagaaaaagagaaaggtcggatccg and ctagcggatccgacctttctctttttctttggg) and inserted into the NheI site of the SENP1 NLS1 mutant, to generate an in-frame SV40 NLS in the N terminus of SENP1, downstream of the FLAG epitope tag. This construct is referred to as SV40 SENP1 NLS1.M1. The plasmid expressing PML ΔSUMO was created by PCR mutagenesis and was derived from a construct expressing PML560 (25.O'Rourke D. Elliott G. Papworth M. Everett R. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This construct contains lysine to arginine substitutions at positions 160 and 490, which are the main sites for SUMO-1 modification. As a result, PMLΔ SUMO is not subject to SUMO-1 modification in vivo. The construct expressing HDAC4-GFP was created from a full-length cDNA clone (ha061161) for HDAC4, provided by Osamu Ohara and Takahiro Nagase of the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (26.Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Note that the clone contained a known point mutation, which was corrected by PCR mutagenesis, and the coding region was then inserted in-frame into pEGFP-N1, to create plasmid pHDAC4-EGFP. Constructs were verified by restriction digestion and by DNA sequencing. Transfections—Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure modified by the use of BES-buffered saline (pH 7.06) as previously described (27.Batchelor A.H. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3573-3582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA was equalized to 2 μg with pUC19 DNA. Immunofluorescence Studies—Approximately 40 h after transfection, cells, plated on glass coverslips, were washed in PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol. Primary antibodies, diluted in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum, were anti-c-Myc 9E10 (1:400; Roche Applied Science) for the Myc tag; anti-GMP-1 (1:1000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or anti-sentrin (1:200; Chemicon) for SUMO-1, and anti-FLAG M2 (1:2000; Stratagene) for the FLAG tag. The anti-PML DB75 rabbit polyclonal antibody has been previously described (24.Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorochrome Alexa 488 or Alexa 543 dyes (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum. Following washing in PBS, cells were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Images for each channel were captured sequentially with 8-fold averaging. Composite illustrations, representative of many images gathered for each test construct and condition, were prepared using Adobe software. Western Blot Analysis—After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% dried nonmilk fat. The membranes were incubated (1 h) with primary antibody in PBST plus 5% dried milk, washed three times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and incubated for a further 1 h in PBST plus 5% dried milk containing the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Following further washing in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, membranes were processed with chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce). Primary antibodies used for immunoblot were anti-c-Myc 9E10 (1:1000; Roche Applied Science), anti-GMP-1 (1:1000), and anti-FLAG M5 (1:5000; Sigma). Immunoprecipitations—Immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged SENP1 from whole cell extracts was performed as follows. A dish (35 mm) of COS-1 cells were transfected with the appropriate construct, and the monolayer was harvested by lysis with IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science). Extracts were bound to FLAG-M2 affinity resin for 3 h and then washed thoroughly with TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Bound protein was eluted from the beads using 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0, and the sample was neutralized with one-tenth volume of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Mapping of a Determinant Required for SENP1 Nuclear Localization—To facilitate our understanding of the regulation and dynamics of SUMO-1 modification, we have been characterizing the mammalian SUMO-1-specific protease, SENP1, an enzyme about which we currently have relatively little information. We previously reported on the construction of a cDNA expression vector for human SENP1 (24.Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), isolated from a human testis cDNA library. Enzymic activity was demonstrated, showing removal of SUMO-1 from the nucleus of target cells and loss of high molecular weight SUMO-1 conjugates. We and others also reported that SENP1 itself displays a mainly nuclear staining pattern, with accumulation in punctate or speckled foci (18.Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 24.Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since compartmentalization of the protease is likely to play a major role in its regulation and substrate specificity, we wished to pursue determinants involved in its localization. A related SUMO-specific protease, SENP2, has recently been reported to exhibit nuclear localization (22.Zhang H. Saitoh H. Matunis M.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6498-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) with a nuclear localization signal identified close to the extreme N terminus between residues 1 and 63. However, sequence alignment analysis of SENP1 and SENP2 indicates that this region is not conserved between the two proteases, prompting us to investigate the sequences of SENP1 that are required for nuclear localization. The schematic in Fig. 1a illustrates certain features of SENP1. The protein possesses a long N-terminal region that is poorly conserved among the SUMO-specific proteases, whereas the more highly conserved core domain (shaded) is located close to the C terminus. The core domain contains the residues HDQC that are predicted to be essential for the formation of the catalytic site (18.Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). SENP1 does not appear to contain any consensus mono- or bipartite NLS. However, the locations of three regions that from computer analysis of signature motifs show a relationship to potential NLSs are indicated. NLS2 (aa 574-577, KKRK) and NLS3 (aa 628-634, PYFRKRM) are putative NLSs that were identified from the Swiss-Prot annotation of the SENP1 sequence. From additional computational analysis based on an algorithm utilizing theoretical NLS prediction (28.Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), we identified a third putative site, NLS1 (aa 171-177, PKKTQRR). While not formally identified as NLSs, these putative sites have been labeled NLS on the schematic for clarity. We constructed a deletion mutant of SENP1 containing the N-terminal 440 residues and lacking the core domain. This construct contains NLS1 but lacks NLS2 and NLS3 and was almost exclusively nuclear, indicating that an NLS was likely to reside within the N terminus of the protein, (or that this smaller variant passively localized to the nucleus, but see below). Attempts at expressing the C terminus of SENP1 in order to examine localization of the isolated core domain and the presence of an NLS within this region were relatively unsuccessful. Possible reasons for the inefficient expression of the C-terminal domain in isolation are discussed in more detail below. We next performed site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted N-terminal NLS (NLS1) in the context of full-length SENP1 by substituting the basic amino acids for glycine residues (PKKQTRR to PGGQTGG). The results indicated a very clear phenotype with the variant (SENP1.NLS1.M1) now accumulating predominantly in the cytoplasm, although minor and variable amounts of the protein could be observed in the nucleus (Fig. 1b). These results indicate that residues within the predicted NLS1 region around positions 170-180 are critical for the nuclear localization of SENP1 and that there appears to be no other independent functional NLS, including those predicted within the C terminus. In an attempt to confirm that this region was the critical NLS responsible for nuclear localization, we fused residues 171-177 to the N terminus of pyruvate kinase, a reporter construct that is usually restricted to the cytoplasm (29.Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 481-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, by this analysis, neither the short motif nor the complete N terminus of SENP1 (aa 1-440) was able to redirect pyruvate kinase to the nucleus (Fig. 1c). These results indicate that whereas the residues around NLS1 are important, they may not be sufficient and that there may be some context sensitivity in the ability of this nonconventional sequence to independently direct a protein to the nucleus. One explanation for the lack of nuclear localization of SENP1.NLS1.M1 was that the mutation affected some global aspect of, for example, protein folding and that this was indirectly responsible for the failure to accumulate in the nucleus. To address this, we constructed a version of SENP1.NLS1.M1, in which we attached a conventional NLS (from SV40 T-antigen) to the N terminus of the protein. We anticipated that this version should now locate to the nucleus and, if active, promote the loss of SUMO-1. This is exactly what was observed. As previously shown for WT SENP1 (24.Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (this paper; e.g. see Fig. 4), the SV40 NLS-containing variant of SENP1.NLS1.M1 located to the nucleus and promoted the loss of SUMO-1 (Fig. 1d). This result provides robust evidence that the lack of nuclear localization of SENP1.NLS1.M1 was not due to some indirect effect affecting overall folding and function of the protein. Thus, both from the observation that this region is identified from homology searching as a putative, although nonclassical NLS, and from the unambiguous results of the effects of substitution of the basic residues, we believe that the NLS1 region is the major determinant for nuclear localization of SENP1. Expression of the SENP1 Core Domain—In an attempt to examine the expression and localization of the C-terminal core domain, we constructed a variant comprising residues 436-644 of SENP1 but found it extremely difficult to detect the protein both by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. Whereas other explanations were possible, one explanation for the poor expression was the possible hyperactivity of the catalytic core of the protease. By analogy with other cysteine proteases, it is generally accepted that the default state of the proteases is one of low activity and that their conversion into the active form is highly regulated. The SUMO-specific proteases possess a well conserved core domain, whereas their N-terminal domains are highly varied in primary sequence and size (23.Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 30.Schwienhorst I. Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 31.Taylor D.L. Ho J.C. Oliver A. Watts F.Z. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1113-1122PubMed Google Scholar). One role of the N-terminal regions of these proteases (in addition to the proposed role above in nuclear localization) could be in regulating activity and substrate selectivity. The interpretation of the result for SENP1 lacking the N terminus is that the core domain may be constitutively active and lack specificity. Constitutive activity may then have had either an intrinsic cytotoxicity or, since many SUMO-1 modified proteins are involved in transcriptional regulation (32.Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), may have affected expression within the transfected cells. In a further attempt to demonstrate catalytic activity of the core domain in mammalian cells, we expressed the SENP1 436-644 construct in cells constitutively expressing higher levels of SUMO-1 (24.Bailey D. O'Hare P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), in which SUMO-1 is more readily assayable. Hep2-SUMO cells were transiently transfected with the SENP1 436-644 construct, fixed, and stained for SENP1 or SUMO-1. Again, consistent with our initial attempts, SENP1 436-644 expression proved difficult to detect, although expression was observed in a minority of cells (less than 1 in 200 cells). However, whereas only low levels of SENP1 436-644 expression could be detected, it was clear that in the cells expressing the SENP1 436-644 core domain, SUMO-1 was significantly reduced (Fig. 2; two representative panels are shown). Although these results do not necessarily indicate that constitutive activity of the core domain accounted for low numbers of positive cells, they do indicate that the core domain was able to promote the loss of SUMO-1. Results below, using a mutant core domain, demonstrate that loss of SUMO-1 was not a nonspecific event and required an intact catalytically active core domain. Localization of a Catalytic Site Mutant of SENP1—A number of residues within the core domain show complete conservation and are predicted to form part of the catalytic site of the enzyme and be involved in isopeptide bond cleavage (Fig. 1a). The cysteine residue at position 603 is predicted to be a part of this catalytic site, and we next examined localization and activity of a mutant (cysteine 603 to serine) that, from known information on the cysteine protease family, would be predicted to be catalytically inactive (Fig. 3a). A variant containing the single cysteine to serine substitution at position 603 was transfected, and localization was examined in parallel with that of the parental WT protein. The results demonstrated that localization of SENP1 C603S was largely similar to the WT SENP1, with both proteins present in a nuclear diffuse pattern together with punctate staining. However, we noted a reproducible difference between the proteins in that whereas WT SENP1 could be readily observed in the cytoplasm, particularly when expressed at higher levels (Fig. 3b, SENP1, long arrows), SENP1 C603S was exclusively nuclear (Fig. 3b, short arrows). This effect was not due to overall difference in expression between the proteins. Both the WT SENP1 and C603S mutant were expressed at similar levels as judged by Western blot (see below). Particularly when analyzing the highest expressing cells on an individual basis, it was clear that WT SENP1 could be detected in the cytoplasm, whereas the C603S mutant was always exclusively nuclear. Although not further investigated here, this difference may be significant, since it has been suggested that SUMO-1 may be involved in nuclear import processes (14.Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 33.Stade K. Vogel F. Schwienhorst I. Meusser B. Volkwein C. Nentwig B. Dohmen R.J.

This raises the possibility that SENP1 may also be involved in this process and/or may be shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. An explanation for the exclusively nuclear accumulation of the catalytically inactive mutant arises from the results below.

https://openalex.org/W2132587070,"Resveratrol (3,4',5-trans-trihydroxystilbene), a phytoalexin present in grapes and red wine, is emerging as a natural compound with potential anticancer properties. Here we show that resveratrol can induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231, a highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cell line, in concomitance with a dramatic endogenous increase of growth inhibitory/proapoptotic ceramide. We found that accumulation of ceramide derives from both de novo ceramide synthesis and sphingomyelin hydrolysis. More specifically we demonstrated that ceramide accumulation induced by resveratrol can be traced to the activation of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the key enzyme of de novo ceramide biosynthetic pathway, and neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase), a main enzyme involved in the sphingomyelin/ceramide pathway. However, by using specific inhibitors of SPT, myriocin and L-cycloserine, and nSMase, gluthatione and manumycin, we found that only the SPT inhibitors could counteract the biological effects induced by resveratrol. Thus, resveratrol seems to exert its growth inhibitory/apoptotic effect on the metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 by activating the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1969724362,"Failure of acute inflammation to resolve leads to persistence of the inflammatory response and may contribute to the development of chronic inflammation. Thus, an understanding of inflammatory resolution will provide insight into the etiology of chronic inflammation. In an acute pleurisy, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were found to predominate at the onset of the lesion but decreased in number by undergoing apoptosis, the principal mechanism by which PMNs died in this model. PMNs were progressively replaced by monocytes, which differentiated into macrophages. As with PMNs, macrophages also underwent programmed cell death leading to an abatement of the inflammatory response and eventual resolution. It was found that apoptosis of both these inflammatory cell types was mediated by pro-resolving cyclooxygenase 2-derived 15deoxyDelta12-14PGJ2, which is uniquely expressed during active resolution. Although PMN programmed cell death is well understood, the observation that macrophages apoptose during resolution of acute inflammation is less well described. These results provide insight into the mechanisms that switch off acute inflammation and prevent complications of wound healing and potentially the development of immune-mediated chronic inflammation."

In addition, Tom1 was found to be capable of binding to clathrin heavy chain through a typical clathrin-binding motif. Fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that green fluorescent protein-Tom1 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas its mutant with deletion of the clathrin-binding motif had a diffuse localization throughout the cell.

Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) as well as an N-terminal VHS domain. Proteins in the second, including Hrs and Vps27, each contain a VHS domain, an FYVE (Fab1b, YOTB, Vac1p, and EEA1) domain that can bind to membrane lipid, a coiled-coil domain that can bind with STAM, a UIM, and a clathrin-binding motif (clathrin box) that is recognized by clathrin (8Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 9Lafer E.M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The third group consists of GGA proteins that each contain a VHS domain, a GAT (for GGA and Tom1) domain that shows homology to the GAT domain of Tom1 protein and binds with ARF (a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein), a flexible hinge region that contains clathrin boxes, and a C-terminal γ-adaptin ear domain with homology to the ear domain of γ-adaptin. The fourth group consists of proteins with an N-terminal VHS domain alone or with other additional domains.

Among the VHS domain-containing proteins, STAM and Hrs bind with each other through their coiled-coil domains to form a complex, and this complex is capable of binding ubiquitin through their UIMs and functions as a sorting factor for ubiquitinated membrane proteins at the endosome (10Polo S.

In addition, GGA proteins recognize the acidic cluster-dileucine motifs present in mannose 6-phosphate receptors through their VHS domains and have been implicated in the sorting of these receptors at the trans-Golgi network (15Dell'Angelica E.C.

Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By means of interactions with these sorting receptors, ARF, and clathrin, GGA proteins play critical roles in the transport of soluble proteins from the trans-Golgi network to the endosome/lysosome. Thus, the above VHS domain-containing proteins have been proposed to function as adaptor proteins in the intracellular trafficking and sorting of plasma membrane proteins and newly synthesized proteins, but the functions of other VHS proteins such as Tom1 have not yet been elucidated. The gene for Tom1 was initially identified as a specific target of retroviral oncogene v-myb (20Burk O. Worpenberg S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This protein has an N-terminal VHS domain (21Lohi O. Lehto V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), followed by a short GAT domain (15Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the VHS domains of Tom1 (22Misra S. Beach B.M. Hurley J.H.

Nature. 2002; 415: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) have been determined, and their structures were found to be composed of a right-handed super helix of eight helices. Although their global structures are similar, the VHS domains of GGA1 and GGA3, but not those of Tom1 and Hrs, have a specific recognition pocket for the acidic cluster-dileucine sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (24Misra S. Puertollano R. Kato Y. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 25Shiba T. Takatsu H. Nogi T. Matsugaki N. Kawasaki M. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Earnest T. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nature. 2002; 415: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the GAT domain of GGA1 has recently been reported to be composed of a three-helix bundle with a long N-terminal helical extension, and this helical extension, which is not conserved in the GAT domain of Tom1, was found to be indispensable for the association of GGA1 with ARF (26Collins B.M. Watson P.J. Owen D.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Suer S. Misra S. Saidi L.F. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2002; 10: 386-393Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, the structure-function relationships in the VHS and GAT domains of GGA proteins have been extensively elucidated, but those of Tom1 have not yet been determined. To determine the functions of Tom1, we searched for proteins that interact with Tom1; by yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified two proteins, Tollip, which has been isolated as a component of the interleukin-1 signaling pathway (29Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and ubiquitin, as Tom1-binding proteins. In this study, we found that Tom1 directly associates with Tollip to form a complex and that Tom1, as well as Tollip, is capable of directly binding with polyubiquitin chains. We also found that Tom1 binds with clathrin heavy chain through its clathrin box. Based on the above findings, we propose that Tom1 functions as a factor that links polyubiquitinated proteins to clathrin. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, HEK293, and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid Construction—The open reading frames of mouse Tom1 and Tollip both containing EcoRI and SalI sites were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR fragments were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Truncated mutants of Tom1 and Tollip were generated by PCR. To generate the expression plasmids, the respective PCR fragments that had been digested with EcoRI and SalI were inserted into the EcoRI and SalI sites of mammalian expression vectors, pCI-neo-T7 (Promega) and pSF1, that had been generated by inserting a fragment encoding three copies of Flag epitope amplified by PCR from the p3xFlag vector (Sigma) into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(–) vector (Invitrogen). The pSF1 vector was prepared by Dr. Y. Saeki in our laboratory. For yeast two-hybrid screening, the PCR fragment encoding the C-terminally truncated mutant of Tom1, Tom1-(1–310), was subcloned into the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). For expressing GST fusion proteins, the PCR fragments encoding full-length Tom1, Tom1-(180–492), and full-length Tollip were subcloned into the pGEX6P1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 cells transformed with the pGBKT7-Tom1-(1–310) plasmid and an NIH3T3 MATCHMAKER cDNA library in the pACT2 vector (Clontech) were plated onto media that lacked tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and had been supplemented with 20 mm 3-amino-1,2,4,-triazole (Sigma). Approximately 1.4 × 105 yeast transformants were screened according to the instructions from the manufacturer. cDNAs derived from positive clones were extracted using a Yeast Plasmid Minipreparation kit (Zymoprep) and subjected to nucleotide sequence determination. Isolation of Recombinant Proteins and Preparation of Polyclonal Antibodies—Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the pGEX6P1-Tollip, pGEX6P1-Tom1, and pGEX6P1-Tom1-(180–492) expression plasmids were cultured overnight at 37 °C in LBA medium (Luria Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin), transferred to a 20-fold volume of LBA medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After the cells had been chilled in water, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the cells at the final concentration of 0.1 μm and the cells were incubated at 20 °C for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed by Y-PER (Pierce) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After the lysate had been centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min, the resulting supernatant was mixed with glutathione-immobilized agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, and the beads were extensively washed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and the complete protease inhibitor mixture). GST fusion proteins were then eluted from the beads with 50 mm glutathione. Alternatively, PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the beads and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight to allow the protease to cleave the specific site between GST and the respective protein. The proteins thus formed were then eluted from the beads and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare anti-Tom1 and anti-Tollip antibodies, the thus purified Tom1-(180–492) and Tollip, respectively, were emulsified with Titer Max Gold (CytRx) and injected subcutaneously into rabbits followed by several booster injections. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HEK293T cells were treated with 50 μm MG132 (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) for 6 h to inhibit proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with buffer B containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and the protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was incubated with protein G- or protein A/G-immobilized agarose beads (Santa Cruz) that had been preloaded with anti-Tom1 antibody, and the immunocomplex produced was extensively washed with buffer B. For detection of interaction between endogenous Tom1 and endogenous clathrin, immunoprecipitation with anti-Tom1 antibody was carried out as described above except for lysis with buffer C containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor mixture, and washing with buffer C including 1% Nonidet P-40. Alternatively, the extracts of HEK293T cells that had been transiently transfected with the indicated expression plasmid using FuGENE 6 and incubated for 36–40 h were prepared as described above and were then incubated with anti-Flag M2 antibody-immobilized agarose beads (Sigma). The immunocomplex produced was extensively washed with buffer B. For two sequential immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-Flag antibody-immobilized beads, the first immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above. SDS-loading buffer was added to the beads recovered by the first immunoprecipitation, and the beads were boiled for 5 min and diluted 10-fold with buffer B including 1% Nonidet P-40. The supernatant recovered by centrifugation was again mixed with anti-Flag antibody-immobilized beads and was then subjected to the second immunoprecipitation as described above. For Western blotting, the whole cell lysate and the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were immunoblotted with anti-Tom1, anti-Tollip, anti-GST (Santa Cruz), anti-T7 (Novagen), anti-Flag M2 (Sigma), anti-ubiquitin (Sigma), anti-polyubiquitin chain (FK2) (30Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and anti-clathrin heavy chain (BD Transduction Laboratories) antibodies and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences), followed by detection with ECL immunoblotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Filtration—HEK293 cells were lysed with buffer B and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The resulting supernatant (200 μl) was applied on a column (1 × 30 cm) of Superdex 200 HR (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with buffer B. Fractions (each 400 μl) were collected, and the aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-Tom1 and anti-Tollip antibodies. The molecular mass was estimated by using thyroglobulin (669 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa) as standards. GST Pull-down Assay—Glutathione-immobilized agarose beads that had been preloaded with GST-Tollip were incubated with 2 μg of Tom1 at 4 °C for 2 h in buffer A containing 5% skim milk. Alternatively, the beads that had been preloaded with GST-Tom1 or GST-Tollip were incubated with a mixture consisting of 2 μg of ubiquitin (Sigma) and 1 μg of polyubiquitin chains composed of 2–4 ubiquitin molecules (Affiniti) at 4 °C for 2 h in buffer A containing 5% skim milk. In both cases, after extensive washing, the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then to Western blotting with anti-Tom1, anti-GST, or anti-ubiquitin antibody. Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—HEK293T cells transfected with the Flag-tagged Tom1 expression plasmid were cultured for 36–40 h, and the cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag M2 antibody-immobilized agarose beads as described above. Flag-tagged Tom1 and its associating proteins in the immunocomplex produced were eluted from the beads with 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 3.0, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The thus separated proteins on the gel were excised, washed three times with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 25 mm NH4HCO3, and vacuum-dried. Ten μg/ml trypsin (Promega) in 45 mm NH4HCO3 was added to dried gel pieces, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptide fragments produced by trypsin digestion were extracted with 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid and concentrated to a volume of 10 μl. To the peptide solution, 1 μl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid was added to give a final concentration of 0.5%, and the mixture was desalted using ZipTip (Millipore). The peptides were then eluted into a matrix solution containing 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. After calibration using a Peptide Mass Standard kit (PerSeptive Biosystems), mass spectra of peptides were measured by a Voyager-STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) and the peptide mass fingerprints were analyzed using the software program Protein Prospector (available at prospector.ucsf.edu/). Fluorescence Microscopy—NIH3T3 cells expressing GFP-Tom1 fusion protein and GFP-Tom1 mutant fusion protein were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing with the saline, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min at room temperature. Fluorescence caused by GFP and DAPI was observed under a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Identification of Tollip and Ubiquitin as Tom1-binding Proteins—By screening a yeast two-hybrid NIH3T3 MATCHMAKER cDNA library with the pGBKT7-Tom1-(1–310) plasmid, we obtained 27 positive clones from 1.4 × 105 independent ones. After sequencing, we found that they encode 13 different proteins. One of the positive clones encodes Tollip, which has been identified as an intermediate in interleukin-1 signaling (29Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Tollip has a CUE domain, which has recently been found to be a ubiquitin-binding motif (31Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 32Donaldson K.M. Yin H. Gekakis N. Supek F. Joazeiro C.A.P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 258-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and has been demonstrated to bind with ubiquitin (31Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Three other positive clones encode two ubiquitin-ribosomal protein fusion proteins and a polyubiquitin. Thus, our yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that Tollip and ubiquitin are candidates for Tom1-binding proteins. Tom1 Binds with Tollip to Form a Complex inside the Cell—To obtain definitive evidence of interaction between Tom1 and Tollip, we co-expressed Flag-tagged Tom1 and T7-tagged Tollip in HEK293T cells, and the extracts of transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag tag antibody and then to Western blotting with anti-T7 tag antibody to detect interaction (Fig. 1A). Tom1 was found to interact with Tollip. Next, to determine whether endogenous Tom1 interacts with endogenous Tollip inside the cell, the extract of HEK293T cells was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Tom1 antibody and then to Western blotting with anti-Tollip antibody to detect interaction (Fig. 1B). It was again found that endogenous Tom1 interacts with endogenous Tollip. We next carried out gel filtration analysis to elucidate the formation of a Tom1-Tollip complex inside the cell. The extract of HEK293 cells was applied on a Superdex 200 HR column, and each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-Tom1 and anti-Tollip antibodies (Fig. 1C). Both Tom1 and Tollip were eluted at almost the same fraction with a molecular mass of ∼350 kDa. Because the molecular masses of Tom1 and Tollip are 60 and 30 kDa, respectively, the complex formed is thought to be a multimer composed of Tom1 and Tollip or a multimer that binds with other proteins. It should be noted that Tom1 also exists in a higher molecular mass complex that lacks Tollip. Because Tom1 forms a complex with Tollip inside the cell, we carried out an experiment to determine whether Tom1 interacts directly with Tollip. Recombinant Tom1 was subjected to a GST pull-down assay after adding GST-Tollip fusion protein (Fig. 1D). Subsequent Western blotting with anti-Tom1 antibody revealed that Tom1 interacts directly with Tollip. Taken together, these results suggest that Tom1 binds with Tollip to form a complex in vivo and in vitro. Determination of Domains of Tom1 and Tollip Required for Their Interactions—Because Tom1 can bind directly with Tollip, we carried out an experiment to determine their domains that are indispensable for their interactions. We constructed various Flag-tagged truncated mutants of Tom1 and Tollip shown in Fig. 2 (A (right panel) and B (right panel), respectively), and co-expressed the respective Flag-tagged truncated mutant and T7-tagged full-length Tom1 or Tollip in HEK293T cells. The extracts of transfected cells were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag tag antibody and then to Western blotting with anti-T7 tag antibody to detect interaction (Fig. 2, left panel). As shown in Fig. 2A, Tollip was found to bind efficiently with full-length Tom1 and truncated mutants of Tom1, Tom1-(1–310) and -(180–492), both containing a GAT domain, but failed to bind with Tom1-(1–180), -(311–492), and -(Δ181–310), indicating that the GAT domain of Tom1 is indispensable for its interaction with Tollip. On the other hand, Tom1 was found to bind with full-length Tollip and C-terminally truncated mutants of Tollip, Tollip-(1–151) and -(1–54), but failed to interact with Tollip-(55–274) (Fig. 2B), indicating that the N-terminal region of Tollip is required for its interaction with Tom1. These domain analyses provide definitive evidence of interaction between Tom1 and Tollip. Tom1 Is a Novel Ubiquitin-binding Protein—Because the results of yeast two-hybrid screening suggested that there is interaction between Tom1 and ubiquitin, we next carried out an experiment to determine whether Tom1 can bind with a ubiquitin and/or polyubiquitin chain. We expressed Flag-tagged Tom1 in HEK293T cells, and the extracts of transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag tag antibody and then to Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody to detect interaction between Tom1 and polyubiquitinated proteins that had been endogenously produced (Fig. 3A, 1st). Endogenous polyubiquitinated proteins were found to be co-immunoprecipitated with Flag-tagged Tom1. To rule out the possibility that the above result might be the result of the polyubiquitination of Tom1 itself, the immunoprecipitates, formed from the lysates of Flag-tagged Tom1-tranfected cells with anti-Flag antibody-immobilized beads, were treated/denatured with 1% SDS to allow them to dissociate into Tom1 and polyubiquitinated proteins. Denatured Tom1 was treated with 1% Nonidet P-40 in a 10-fold volume and again subjected to the second immunoprecipitation and then to Western blotting as described above (Fig. 3A, 2nd). Signals caused by the polyubiquitin chains were undetectable in the second immunoprecipitation, although the signal caused by Flag-tagged Tom1 was detectable. Thus, these results rule out the possibility of polyubiquitination of Tom1 under the conditions used. It should be noted that monoubiquitinated Tom1 (Ub-Tom1 in Fig. 3A) was detected by Western blotting with anti-Flag tag antibody in the first and second immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3A, right panel), indicating that Tom1 i"

HHV8 encodes for a viral FLICE-inhibitory protein (vFLIP), designated K13, which resembles the prodomain of caspase-8 in structure and has been shown to protect cells against death receptor-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In this report, we present evidence that HHV8 vFLIP also possesses the unique ability of transforming Rat-1 and Balb/3T3 fibroblast cells, which is not shared by other vFLIPs. Rat-1 cells expressing HHV8 vFLIP form colonies in soft agar and form tumors in nude mice. The transforming ability of HHV8 vFLIP is associated with the activation of the NF-κB pathway and is blocked by molecular and chemical inhibitors of this pathway. Our results suggest that vFLIP K13 has activity beyond its role as an inhibitor of death receptor signaling and may play a causative role in the pathogenesis of HHV8-associated malignancies. Furthermore, inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway may have a role in the treatment of malignancies linked to HHV8 infection.

Kaposi's sarcoma human herpes virus 8 viral FLICE-inhibitory protein inhibitor of κB primary effusion lymphoma viral G-protein-coupled receptor. Despite the increasing evidence linking the presence of HHV8 with KS and lymphoproliferative disorders, the mechanism by which this virus leads to a transformed phenotype is not entirely clear. Although HHV8 is known to encode for homologs of several cytokines and their receptors, none of them is expressed in latently infected PEL cell lines or KS spindle cells (6Schulz T.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1573-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). HHV8 is also known to encode for a viral FLICE-inhibitory protein (vFLIP), encoded by the open reading frame K13 (orf-K13; also called orf71). HHV8 vFLIP is one of the few viral proteins to be expressed in latently infected KS spindle cells and PEL cell lines (6Schulz T.F. J. Gen.

HHV8 vFLIP resembles the prodomain of caspase-8 (also called FLICE) in structure and, like it, contains two homologous copies of a death effector domain (10Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K.

We have previously demonstrated that the HHV8 vFLIP possesses the unique ability of activating the NF-κB pathway in both solid tumor and lymphoid cell lines, which is not shared by the E8 and MC159L vFLIPs (13Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 14Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation by vFLIP K13 was recently independently confirmed by several investigators (15Field N. Low W. Daniels M. Howell S. Daviet L. Boshoff C. Collins M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16An J. Sun Y. Sun R. Rettig M.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3371-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since the abnormal activation of the NF-κB pathway has been previously implicated in the cellular transformation induced by several viruses (17Mosialos G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), in this study we have investigated the ability of HHV8 vFLIP to induce cellular transformation and analyzed the contribution of the NF-κB to this process. Cell Lines and Culture—Rat-1 cells were obtained from Dr. Robert Ilaria (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), and BALB/3T3 clone A31 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. 293T cells were obtained from Dr. David Han (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Phenylarsine oxide, arsenic trioxide, and aspirin were purchased from Sigma. Lactacystin was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Retrovirus and Adenovirus Constructs—Retrovirus constructs containing C-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged HHV8 vFLIP (K13-FLAG) and EHV2 vFLIP (E8-FLAG) and molluscum contagiosum virus vFLIP (MC159L-FLAG) were generated in MSCV neo-based retroviral vector, and amphotropic viruses were generated and used for infection as described previously (14Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cells were selected in the presence of 1000 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen). Adenoviral vectors encoding β-galactosidase and IκB superrepressor (DN-IκBα) were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Gaynor (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (14Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Primary antibody dilutions used in these experiments were FLAG (sc-807, 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), actin (sc-1616, 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-IκBα (SC-371, 1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and p-IκBα (9241S, 1:1000; Cell Signaling). Soft Agar Assays—Rat-1 cells expressing an empty vector or vFLIP K13 were overlaid as a single cell suspension of 1500 cells in 1 ml of 0.4% Bacto-agar onto a 3.5-cm tissue culture dish containing a 0.6% agar base. All agar media were made with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin. Triplicate plates were prepared for each tested cell line and inspected for colony formation after incubation at 37 °C for 14 days. To test the effect of inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway on anchorage-independent growth, Rat-1 vFLIP K13 cells were plated at a density of 1500 cells per 3.5-cm plate in soft agar in the presence of inhibitor or Me2SO alone, and colony number was scored on day 14. Tumorgenicity Assays—Rat-1 cells expressing the empty vector and vFLIP K13 were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. 5 × 106 (200 μl) cells were injected in the flanks of 8–10-week-old female nude mice (NCr/nu/nu, Taconic Farm, Germantown, NY). Mice were monitored for 6 weeks following injection, at which time they were sacrificed, and the tumors were resected for histological examination. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed essentially as described previously (14Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assay—Rat-1 cells stably expressing empty vector or different vFLIP were transiently transfected with an NF-κB/luciferase reporter construct and a synthetic Renilla luciferase reporter vector (phRL-TK; Promega, Madison, WI) by using LipofectAMINE PLUS™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were lysed using the Renilla luciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and assayed for firefly and luciferase activities. Firefly luciferase activity was performed as described previously (18Chaudhary P.M. Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Kumar A. Liu L. Hood L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4451-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and Renilla luciferase assay was performed using the Renilla luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized relative to the Renilla luciferase activity to control for the difference in the transfection efficiency. The NF-κB reporter assay in 293T cells was performed essentially as described previously (18Chaudhary P.M. Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Kumar A. Liu L. Hood L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4451-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Southern Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and digested with EcoRI, which cuts once within the retroviral vector. Southern blot analysis was performed using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The blot was hybridized with32P-labeled, full-length K13 probe according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of Rat-1 Cells with Stable Expression of vFLIPs—In order to study the effect of HHV8 vFLIP on cellular transformation, we used retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to generate a polyclonal population of Rat-1 cells with stable expression of FLAG epitope-tagged HHV8 vFLIP (K13-FLAG) or an empty vector. Following infection with the respective retroviruses, colonies were selected with G418 (Geneticin) and pooled to generate a polyclonal population of cells. In addition to HHV8 vFLIP, we also generated Rat-1 cells expressing equine herpes virus 2-encoded vFLIP E8 and molluscum contagiosum virus-encoded vFLIP MC159L to serve as controls. Expression of the transduced proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis with the FLAG antibody (Fig. 1). HHV8-encoded vFLIP K13 Affects Cellular Growth and Proliferation—We next studied the effect of expression of vFLIPs on the in vitro growth and proliferation of Rat-1 cells. For this purpose, we plated an equal number of vector and vFLIP K13-expressing cells and estimated cellular proliferation by measuring daily cell count. As shown in Fig. 2A, we obtained ∼1.6-fold more vFLIP K13 cells 5 days after plating as compared with the vector-expressing cells. We next used flow cytometry to study the effect of K13 expression on cellular size. Consistent with the higher proliferation rate of Rat-1 K13 cells, we observed a decrease in their cell size as compared with the vector-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). HHV8-encoded vFLIP K13 Induces Cellular Proliferation— One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is the ability to overcome growth-inhibitory stimuli. As such, we tested whether expression of vFLIP K13 confers on Rat-1 cells the ability to overcome contact-mediated block to cellular proliferation. As shown in Fig. 3A, Rat-1 cells expressing empty vector showed contact inhibition upon reaching confluence, whereas HHV8 vFLIP K13-expressing cells piled up and formed colonies beyond the cell monolayer, a feature of transformed cells. This transformed phenotype was unique to the HHV8 vFLIP K13-expressing cells and was not seen in those expressing the E8 and MC159L vFLIPs (data not shown). Anchorage-independent growth is another characteristic feature of the transformed cells. We used a soft agar colony formation assay to test the ability of various vFLIPs to confer anchorage-independent growth. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, Rat-1 cells transduced with the empty vector failed to form any colony in soft agar, whereas those expressing HHV8 vFLIP K13 formed large colonies with high frequency. Rat-1 cells expressing E8 and MC159L vFLIPs failed to form any colony in soft agar (Fig. 3C), suggesting once again that the transforming property is unique to the HHV8-encoded vFLIP. In order to rule out the possibility that the transformed phenotype of vFLIP K13 expressing Rat-1 cells is due to insertional mutagenesis/secondary mutation during the selection of a stable population of cells, we infected Rat-1 cells with retroviruses encoding an empty vector, vFLIP K13, or vFLIP E8 and after 24 h plated them in a soft agar assay without prior drug selection. As shown in Fig. 3D, Rat-1 cells infected with vFLIP K13 readily formed colonies in soft agar, whereas those infected with empty vector or vFLIP E8 failed to do so. In order to provide additional evidence that the transformed phenotype of Rat-1 K13 cells is not due to insertional mutagenesis and overgrowth of a mutant clone, we used Southern blot to analyze the site(s) of proviral integration in the mass population of Rat-1 K13 cells as well as three independent subclones isolated from soft agar colonies (Fig. 3E). This analysis revealed multiple sites of integration of the provirus in the mass population of Rat-1 cells. Furthermore, the three independent soft agar colonies demonstrated distinct sites of provirus integration, indicating that they arose from distinct clones. Taken together, the above results strongly argue against the possibility that transformed phenotype of Rat-1 K13 cells is due to insertional mutagenesis/secondary mutation followed by selection and overgrowth of a mutant clone. Tumorigenic Potential of Rat-1 Cells Expressing HHV8 vFLIP K13—After confirming the in vitro transforming ability of HHV8 vFLIP, we were interested in testing whether expression of this protein confers tumorigenic potential on cells in vivo. For this purpose, Rat-1 cells expressing an empty vector or HHV8 vFLIP K13 were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, and their ability to form tumors was analyzed. We observed tumor formation in all five mice injected with Rat-1 vFLIP K13 cells, whereas none of the mice injected with the Rat-1 vector cells developed tumors (Fig. 4, A and B). Expression of vFLIP K13 was readily detected in the freshly dissected tumors (Fig. 4C). The tumors had histomorphological features of fibrosarcoma and were composed of plump spindle cells with relatively abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 4, D and E). Cells had atypical morphology with vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant mitotic figures. Taken together with the in vitro studies, the above results demonstrate that HHV8 vFLIP is an oncogene that triggers intracellular signaling pathways leading to cell transformation and tumorigenicity. It is conceivable that the tumorigenic potential of vFLIP K13-expressing Rat-1 cells is due to their ability to block death receptor-induced apoptosis. Therefore, in an independent experiment, we compared the tumorigenic potential of Rat-1 vFLIP K13 cells with those expressing vFLIP E8, which is known to block death receptor-induced apoptosis (10Thome M.

As shown in Table II, whereas Rat-1 cells infected with vFLIP K13 readily formed tumors in nude mice, those infected with an empty vector or vFLIP E8 failed to do so. Furthermore, a Southern blot analysis revealed multiple sites of provirus integration in the tumor-derived cells (Fig. 3E). Collectively, the above results argue against the possibility that the tumorigenic potential of Rat-1 cells expressing vFLIP K13 is due to insertional mutagenesis/secondary mutation followed by overgrowth of a mutant subclone.Table IITumor formation by Rat-1 cells infected by vFLIP-encoding retrovirusesVirus typeNo. of injected miceaRat-1 cells were infected with retroviruses encoding an empty vector, vFLIP K13, or vFLIP E8.

Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 19Keller S.A. Schattner E.J. Cesarman E. Blood. 2000; 96: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated constitutive NF-κB activation in HHV8-infected PEL cell lines. We have also demonstrated that HHV8-encoded vFLIP K13 can activate the NF-κB pathway, whereas the E8 and MC159L vFLIPs lack this property (13Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 14Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in checking whether the differential ability of these vFLIPs to induce cellular transformation could be attributed to their differential ability to activate the NF-κB pathway in Rat-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated significant NF-κB-binding activity in Rat-1 cells expressing vFLIP K13 as compared with those expressing an empty vector or vFLIPs E8 and MC159L. Constitutive NF-κB activation in vFLIP K13-expressing Rat-1 cells was further confirmed by transfection of an NF-κB luciferase reporter construct. As shown in Fig. 5B, this assay demonstrated significant NF-κB transcription activity in Rat-1 cells expressing HHV8 vFLIP as compared with those expressing empty vector or vFLIP E8 and MC159L. NF-κB is usually present in the cytoplasm of cells in association with a family of inhibitory proteins, called IκB (20Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5551) Google Scholar, 21Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). Cytokine-inducible phosphorylation of the IκB proteins leads to their rapid ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, which releases NF-κB from their inhibitory influence (20Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5551) Google Scholar, 21Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). Consistent with the increased NF-κB-binding activity in vFLIP K13-expressing Rat-1 cells, we also observed an increase in the phosphorylated IκBα and a decrease in the total IκBα protein in these cells as compared with those expressing empty vector and E8 (Fig. 5C). In addition, we observed an increase in phosphorylated IκBα and a decrease in total IκBα in two subclones of K13-expressing Rat-1 cells generated from soft agar colonies (Fig. 5C). HHV8 vFLIP Induces Cellular Transformation via the NF-κB Pathway—In order to test the hypothesis that vFLIP K13 induces cellular transformation via the activation of the NF-κB pathway, we took advantage of known inhibitors of this pathway. As shown in Fig. 6A, infection of Rat-1 vFLIP K13-expressing cells with an adenovirus encoding a phosphorylation-resistant dominant-negative form of IκBα (IκBα superrepressor), which is known to block NF-κB activation via diverse stimuli (22Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 23Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar), led to significant inhibition of soft agar colony formation. We also studied the effect of various chemical inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway on cellular transformation induced by vFLIP K13. Lactacystin is a proteasome inhibitor that block NF-κB activation by blocking the degradation of IκB (24Grisham M.B. Palombella V.J. Elliott P.J. Conner E.M. Brand S. Wong H.L. Pien C. Mazzola L.M. Destree A. Parent L. Adams J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 345-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas aspirin, phenylarsine oxide, and arsenic trioxide are believed to block NF-κB activation by blocking the IKK complex (25Estrov Z. Manna S.K. Harris D. Van Q. Estey E.H. Kantarjian H.M. Talpaz M. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 1999; 94: 2844-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, significant inhibition of colony formation was seen upon treatment with all of the above compounds. Furthermore, treatment with phenylarsine oxide significantly blocked the focus formation and transformed phenotype of Rat-1 K13 cells grown in monolayer culture (Fig. 6C). Taken together with the inhibitory effect of DN-IκBα, the above results support an essential role of the NF-κB pathway in cellular transformation induced by vFLIP K13. Transforming Ability of HHV8 vFLIP Correlates with Its Ability to Activate the NF-κB Pathway—We used site-directed mutagenesis to mutate several amino acids in the first death effector domain of vFLIP K13 that are conserved among the various death effector domain-containing proteins (Fig. 7A). The amino acid residues 58–60 and 67–69 were replaced with alanine residues in the constructs 58ECL/AAA and 67DLL/AAA, respectively (Fig. 7A). Transient transfection of these constructs into 293 cells along with an NF-κB reporter construct revealed that mutant 67DLL/AAA retained ∼20% of the NF-κB activity of the wild-type protein, whereas mutant 58ECL/AAA has completely lost this activity (Fig. 7B). We next compared the ability of the wild-type and mutant K13 constructs to induce cellular transformation of Rat-1 cells using the soft agar colony formation assay. For this purpose, Rat-1 cells were infected with retroviruses encoding the various constructs and subsequently plated in soft agar. As shown in Fig. 7, C and D, Rat-1 cells infected with the wild-type K13 virus gave rise to a large number of colonies, most of which consisted of more than 100 cells. In contrast, an ∼10-fold decrease in colony number was seen in cells infected with retroviruses encoding the 67DLL/AAA mutant protein (Fig. 7C). These colonies were also small in size as compared with those formed by the wild-type K13 protein (Fig. 7D). Finally, no significant soft agar colony formation was detected in cells infected with the mutant 58ECL/AAA, which lacks NF-κB activity (Fig. 7, C and D). Collectively, the above results demonstrate a strong correlation between the transforming ability of vFLIP K13 and its mutants with their ability to activate the NF-κB pathway and further support the hypothesis that NF-κB pathway may play an essential role in cellular transformation induced by this protein. HHV8 vFLIP K13 Transforms Balb/3T3 Cells—We were next interested in finding out whether the transforming ability of vFLIP K13 was limited to Rat-1 cells. In order to test whether vFLIP K13 can transform additional cell lines, we used retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to generate a mass population of mouse Balb/3T3 cells with stable expression of an empty vector or vFLIP K13 (Fig. 8A). As shown in Fig. 8, B and C, Balb/3T3 cells expressing vFLIP K13 could form colonies in soft agar, whereas those an expressing empty vector failed to do so. Consistent with our previous results with Rat-1 cells, expression of vFLIP K13 in Balb/3T3 cells was also associated with constitutive activation of the NF-κB pathway as determined by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 8D). In this report, we present evidence that HHV8 vFLIP K13 possesses several characteristics of oncogenes, such as the ability to promote increased cellular proliferation, loss of contact inhibition, anchorage-independent growth, and formation of tumors in nude mice. In addition to vFLIP, the HHV8 genome is known to encode for several transformation-related genes, such as K1, K9, K12, LANA, vIRF1, and G-protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) (6Schulz T.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1573-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). HHV8-encoded K1 protein is known to immortalize primary T cells and induce lymphoproliferative disease in a transgenic mouse model (26Prakash O. Tang Z.Y. Peng X. Coleman R. Gill J. Farr G. Samaniego F. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similarly, vGPCR has been shown to stimulate both cellular proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro and in transgenic mice (27Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 28Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Gerhengorn M.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Although HHV8 possesses a number of potential oncogenes, the transforming activity of the complete virus is relatively modest. A possible explanation for the above discrepancy may lie in the fact that a majority of HHV8-encoded oncogenes are not expressed in the cells latently infected with this virus (6Schulz T.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1573-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Importantly, vFLIP K13 is expressed in latently infected PEL cell lines and KS spindle cells, making it a good candidate for the transforming ability of HHV8 (6Schulz T.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1573-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 7Sturzl M. Hohenadl C. Zietz C. Castanos-Velez E. Wunderlich A. Ascherl G. Biberfeld P. Monini P. Browning P.J. Ensoli B. J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 5915-5921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is conceivable that vFLIP K13 cooperates with the viral oncogenes expressed during the lytic phase in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoproliferative syndromes observed in patients infected with HHV8. We and others (14Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 19Keller S.A. Schattner E.J. Cesarman E. Blood. 2000; 96: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that HHV8-infected primary effusion lymphoma cell lines have constitutive NF-κB activation. In the present study, we demonstrate a key role of the NF-κB pathway in vFLIP K13-induced cellular transformation. The NF-κB pathway is also involved in the protective effect of K13 against growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis (29Sun Q. Matta H. Chaudhary P.M. Blood. 2003; 101: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Abnormal NF-κB activation has been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of several lymphoid malignancies. For example, Tax and latent membrane protein 1 are believed to play a key role in the transforming ability of the human T-cell leukemia virus-1 and Epstein-Barr virus, respectively, and abnormal NF-κB activation has been demonstrated to play a critical role in cellular transformation by both these proteins (17Mosialos G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that as in the case with Tax and latent membrane protein 1, vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation plays an important role in lymphoproliferative disorders seen in association with HHV8 infection. The exact mechanism of cellular transformation induced by vFLIP K13 is not known at present. However, the NF-κB pathway is known to activate a number of genes involved in cell cycle progression and protection against apoptosis, such as cyclin D1, bcl2, bclxL, cell inhibitors of apoptosis protein, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (30Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M55-M62PubMed Google Scholar), and it is conceivable that some or all of these genes are involved in vFLIP K13-induced transformation. Furthermore, it is possible that vFLIP K13-induced NF-κB activation cooperates with additional signaling pathways activated by this protein as well as other HHV8-encoded proteins (e.g. K1, K9, K12, vIRF1, LANA, and vGPCR) to induce cellular transformation. At the time of their discovery, it was speculated that the main biological function of vFLIPs is to function as inhibitors of caspase-8 activation and thereby protect the virally infected cells from apoptosis induced by the death receptors (10Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Fickenscher H. Meinl E. Neipel F. Mattmann C. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Tschopp J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9621-9624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It can be argued that the tumorigenic potential of vFLIP K13 is not related to its transforming ability but is due to increased apoptotic resistance against the residual immune system of nude mice. However, several lines of evidence argue against this hypothesis. First, the tumorigenic potential of vFLIP K13 expressing cells in nude mice is associated with several in vitro properties commonly seen in transformed cells, such as increased cellular proliferation, lack of contact inhibition, and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. It is highly unlikely that the above attributes of K13-expressing cells are due to its antiapoptotic property. Second, the ability of vFLIP K13 to transform Rat-1 cells is not shared by other vFLIPs. For example, E8 and MC159L, two vFLIPs known to block death receptor-induced apoptosis, failed to induce cellular transformation and/or form colonies in nude mice. Third, we have demonstrated that K13-induced cellular transformation is associated with NF-κB activation, a signaling pathway that, as discussed above, has been implicated in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis by a number of other viral proteins (17Mosialos G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fourth, we have previously demonstrated that, unlike cFLIP, vFLIP K13 has no significant protective effect against death receptor-induced apoptosis (29Sun Q. Matta H. Chaudhary P.M. Blood. 2003; 101: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Matta H. Eby M.T. Gazdar A.F. Chaudhary P.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study found that vFLIP K13 primarily interacts with proteins involved in NF-κB activation and did not detect any interaction with proteins involved in death receptor-induced caspase activation (15Field N. Low W. Daniels M. Howell S. Daviet L. Boshoff C. Collins M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, taken together, our data suggest that vFLIP K13 can induce cellular transformation and tumorigenesis via activation of the NF-κB pathway and independent of its effect on death receptor-induced apoptosis. Recent studies, based on the genetic and molecular analysis of the processes of cell division and apoptosis, suggest that cell proliferation and apoptosis are coupled; the tendency of cells to undergo apoptosis is a normal consequence of engaging the cell's proliferative machinery (32Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 33Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2665) Google Scholar). Thus, cellular transformation by a number of oncogenes is frequently coupled to increased sensitivity to apoptosis. For example, whereas both MYC and adenoviral E1A protein promote cellular proliferation, they are also powerful inducers of apoptosis, especially under conditions of stress, depleted survival factors, and genotoxic stress (32Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 34Evan G. Harrington E. Fanidi A. Land H. Amati B. Bennett M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

It is believed that this innate apoptotic potential of oncogenes serves as an in-built foil to their tumorigenic capacity and limits the potential size of tumors induced by them (32Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 33Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2665) Google Scholar). In this context, we point out that we recently demonstrated that HHV8 vFLIP possesses the unique ability to protect TF-1 leukemia cells against growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of several antiapoptotic proteins (29Sun Q. Matta H. Chaudhary P.M. Blood. 2003; 101: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This protective effect was dependent on NF-κB activation and independent of its protective effect against death receptor-induced apoptosis (29Sun Q. Matta H. Chaudhary P.M. Blood. 2003; 101: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that in addition to inducing cellular transformation, the K13-induced NF-κB pathway might also promote tumor growth by protecting the transformed cells against apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of antiapoptotic genes. Consistent with the above hypothesis, expression of HHV8 vFLIP in murine B lymphoma cells was shown to promote tumor development and progression when injected into immunocompetent mice, thereby establishing it as a new class of tumor progression factor (37Djerbi M. Screpanti V. Catrina A.I. Bogen B. Biberfeld P. Grandien A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, HHV8 vFLIP might contribute to the multistep process of tumorigenesis at several stages, as a transforming protein during tumor initiation and as an inhibitor of growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis during tumor progression. In the present study, we have demonstrated the ability of inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway to block K13-induced cellular transformation. A number of NF-κB inhibitors are in various stages of clinical development or in clinical use for the treatment of hematological malignancies (25Estrov Z. Manna S.K. Harris D. Van Q. Estey E.H.

(never in mitosis, gene A) was originally identified in Aspergillus nidulans as a serine/threonine kinase critical for cell cycle progression. Temperature-sensitive mutants of NIMA or overexpression of dominant-negative forms of NIMA cause cells to arrest in G2 with uncondensed DNA and interphase microtubules (1Osmani A.H. McGuire S.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 283-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of NIMA in fungus as well as in mammalian cells leads to the early onset of mitotic events including chromatin condensation and depolymerization of microtubules (2Lu K.P. Hunter T. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 187-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the appropriate degradation of NIMA is required for mitotic exit (3Pu R.T. Osmani S.A.

The sequencing of the human genome has revealed a relatively divergent family of 11 mammalian Neks. The Neks are most closely related to NIMA in their N-terminal catalytic domain sequences, but each diverges substantially from NIMA in its non-catalytic C-terminal tail. Nek1 is highly expressed in meiotic germ cells and was proposed to play roles in meiotic events (4Letwin K. Mizzen L. Motro B. Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3521-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Position cloning studies revealed Nek1 as the gene altered in polycystic kidney disease, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown (5Upadhya P. Birkenmeier E.H. Birkenmeier C.S. Barker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nek2 was the first human Nek shown to play a role in mitotic progression. Nek2 probably plays a role in centrosome duplication but is dispensable for cell cycle entry (6Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Endogenous Nek2 associates with centrosomes, and overexpression of Nek2 causes a striking splitting of centrosomes but does not prevent cells from entering mitosis. The functions of other Neks are largely unknown. Recently Nek6 and the closely related Nek7 were shown to phosphorylate the protein kinase p70 S6 kinase on Thr-412 within a hydrophobic motif in the activation loop (7Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, studies to determine the substrate specificity of Nek6 using peptides derived from annotated phosphorylation sites in human proteins suggested that Nek6 does not phosphorylate p70 S6 kinase either in vitro or in vivo (8Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Morrice N. Kieloch A. Hastie C.J. Dong L. Schutkowski M. Reimer U. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). More recently, Nercc1 (also termed Nek8 in Ref. 9Holland P.M. Milne A. Garka K. Johnson R.S. Willis C. Sims J.E. Rauch C.T. Bird T.A. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16229-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was identified by association with Nek6 and Nek7. Microinjection of anti-Nercc1 antibodies in prophase causes spindle abnormalities and/or chromosomal misalignment suggesting that Nercc1, and possibly also Nek6 and Nek7, may play a role in mitotic regulation (10Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, we find that Nek6 kinase activity is up-regulated in M phase. Expression of an inactive Nek6 mutant arrested cells in M phase and interfered with chromosome segregation. Depletion of endogenous Nek6 protein using siRNA resulted in M phase arrest followed by apoptosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that Nek6 is required for cell cycle progression through mitosis and demonstrate that loss of Nek6 function leads to defective mitosis and apoptosis. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Cycle Synchronization—HeLa, HeLa Tet-On, and MDA-MB231 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA duplex transfection was performed using OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A lamin siRNA was used as control. The following oligonucleotides were used. Lamin A/C, 5′-CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACAdTdT (11Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8107) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides were used as siRNA specific for Nek6: 5′-GAUCGAGCAGUGUGACUACdTdT and 5′-GCUCGGUGACCUUGGUCUGdTdT. All siRNA duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon Research. To synchronize the cells for cell cycle studies, HeLa cells were seeded at 60% confluency and cultured for 24 h, and then 2 mm thymidine was added for another 14 h. After washing the cells, the medium was replaced, and the cells were allowed to continue the cell cycle for 11 h. Aphidicolin (1 μg/ml) was added to the cells for 14 h. The cells were then washed, released to grow in fresh medium, and then harvested every 2 h to monitor the different cell cycle stages. Plasmid Constructs and Establishment of Stable Tumor Cell Lines— Wild type Nek6 was obtained by PCR using an expressed sequence tag clone (accession number, NM_014397) as template. The resulting cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pCAN-HA vector (a pcDNA3 backbone plasmid with a HA tag N-terminal of the fusion protein). Two point mutations were made in the wild type Nek6 cDNA, K74M and K75M (KK/MM), to generate a kinase-inactive mutant. The KK/MM mutant was made with the following oligonucleotides using a QuikChange PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene): GACAGTGGCGTTGATGAAGGTGCAGATC and GACAGTGGCGTTGATGATGGTGCAGATCTTTGAG. Nek6 wild type and mutant (KK/MM) cDNAs were subcloned into the pBabe-puro retroviral vector as a blunted HindIII and NotI fragment. pBabe-Nek6 constructs were co-transfected into 293 cells with amphotropic retroviral packaging vectors (12Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5110-5113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6. Viral supernatants were used to infect HeLa and MDA-MB231 cell lines. Puromycin-resistant pools were generated, and individual clones were grown out of the pools to screen for higher expression of the Nek6 constructs. Wild type and KK/MM Nek6 HindIII and NotI fragments were also cloned into a pRevTRE vector (Clontech). The virus particles were collected as described above and used to infect HeLa Tet-On cells (Clontech). The expression of Nek6 wild type and the KK/MM mutant was under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter. Hygromycin B was used to select for stable clones. The experiments described in the figures were done using at least three individual cell clones. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assays—Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times and harvested. Cell pellets were incubated with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml AEBSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and E-64 as protease inhibitors) at 4 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected as whole cell lysate. Anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5 at 1:1000 dilution) or Nek6 N-serum (1:500) was incubated with cell lysate at 4 °C for 2 h, and 20 μl of prewashed protein-G-agarose was added and incubated for 1 h. The beads were then washed with lysis buffer five times and then with kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The washed beads were then suspended in the kinase buffer supplemented with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of 5 μg of myelin basic protein or 1 μg of peptide/reaction. The beads were then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to stop the reaction, and half of the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE to separate the proteins on the gel. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed. The other half of the sample was subjected to Western blot analysis. Antibodies and Time-lapse Microscopy—A mixture of the two peptides corresponding to the N-terminal domain of Nek6 (MAGQPGHMPHGGSSNNLCHTLG and QRHPNTLSFRCSLADFQIEK, amino acids 1–22 and 30–49, respectively) was used to obtain polyclonal antibodies (Nek6 N-serum). PBOS-H2BGFP vector was purchased from Pharmingen and transfected into HeLa Tet-On cells expressing wild type or kinase-dead Nek6 upon doxycycline induction. Time-lapse recording was set up by monitoring green fluorescence, and the images were captured every 7 min for 30 h. FACS Analysis and Apoptosis Assays—For FACS assays, cells were trypsinized and harvested, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline several times, gently fixed with 85% cold ethanol, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Fixed cells were spun down, resuspended in DNA staining solution (1 mg/ml RNase A, 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.05 mm EDTA), and subjected to flow cytometry. For apoptosis assays, sub-G1 cells of propidium iodide staining were assayed by FACS. An annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (Oncogene Research) was also used to monitor apoptosis according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nek6 Kinase Activity Is Cell Cycle-regulated—NIMA mRNA and protein levels peak at G2/M phase, and NIMA kinase activity is activated by multiple phosphorylations upon entry into mitosis (1Osmani A.H. McGuire S.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 283-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Osmani S.A. May G.S. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 14Ye X.S. Xu G. Pu R.T. Fincher R.R. McGuire S.L. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 986-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because of the structural relationship between Nek6 and NIMA, we asked also whether Nek6 activity was cell cycle-regulated. First we sought to identify suitable peptide substrates to assay Nek6 kinase activity. Nek6 was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected cells and used to screen a peptide library that contained 96 distinct peptides with potential sites for serine or threonine phosphorylation. Several peptides were found to be good Nek6 substrates, and one of these was used in further Nek6 kinase assays (Fig. 1A). Wild type Nek6 efficiently phosphorylated myelin basic protein as well as the selected peptide, whereas a mutant of Nek6 in which critical residues within the ATP binding region were mutated (Nek6-KK/MM) had no detectable activity. To follow endogenous Nek6 kinase activity through the cell cycle, Nek6 antibodies were used to precipitate endogenous Nek6 protein from the lysate of HeLa cells that had been synchronized at the G1/S boundary by thymidine and aphidicolin double blocks. At various time points after release from the block, samples were collected to obtain cells enriched in S, M, and G1 phases of the cell cycle. To verify proper synchronization, samples were labeled with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). The results of the in vitro kinase assay revealed that Nek6 autophosphorylation and kinase activity toward the peptide substrate are highest in the G2/M phase. Nek6 protein levels did not change significantly during the cell cycle (Fig. 1B, panel 3). We did, however, observe reduced electrophoretic mobility of Nek6 from mitotic cells probably because of phosphorylation modification of Nek6 protein. To determine whether this slower mobility was because of phosphorylation, we used lysate from nocodazole-treated cells to arrest cells in mitotic phase to perform kinase assays and Western analysis. Lysates were prepared from the mitotic-arrested population as well as from the interphase cells, and endogenous Nek6 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and assayed for kinase activity. The immune complex was also treated with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1C, lane CIAP) to examine the phosphorylation state of endogenous Nek6 (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1B, Nek6 from mitotic cells had increased kinase activity. In addition, a fraction of the isolated Nek6 had reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE. Upon treatment with alkaline phosphatase, the slower mobility band disappeared indicating that the observed band shift is because of phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, phosphatase treatment abolished the kinase activity indicating that phosphorylated Nek6 behaves as an active form to contribute its kinase activity during the M phase. We noticed a different amount of modified Nek6 between nocodazole-treated cells and thymidine-aphidicolin double block synchronized cells; this is probably because of the different synchronization methods. HeLa cells were released to grow in fresh media after thymidine-aphidicolin double blocks, and most of the cells are in the same M phase stages at the 8-h time point. While using nocodazole to block cells in the M phase, a fraction of cells were expected to undergo apoptosis because of disruption of the microtubule organization; therefore a smaller fraction of total cell lysate contains active phosphorylated Nek6. Nocodazole is thought to target microtubules to arrest cells in M phase. It is also possible that the microtubule disorganization has caused less active Nek6 in M phase; however, whether microtubule structure plays a role in Nek6 activity still needs to be investigated more carefully. These results indicate that Nek6 kinase activity is cell cycle-regulated and suggest that Nek6 may play a role in the regulation of mitotic progression. Nek6 Kinase Activity Is Required during Mitosis—Because we have shown that Nek6 kinase activity is cell cycle-regulated, we were interested in determining whether Nek6 activity is critical in entry, progression, or exit from mitosis. To this end, we overexpressed wild type Nek6 or inactive Nek6-KK/MM in MDA-MB231 cells. We first performed proliferation assays to determine whether Nek6 had a general effect on the cell cycle. Fig. 2A shows the results from colorimetric assays (left panel) as well as direct cell counting (right panel). Wild type Nek6 and vector control stable clones had similar proliferation curves, although stable clones expressing kinase-dead Nek6 exhibited a slower proliferation rate. Next, MDA-MB231 stable clone cells were seeded at 60% confluency, cultured for 2 days, and harvested to determine cell cycle profile by FACS analysis (Fig. 2B). The results showed that MDA-MB231 cells expressing wild type Nek6 had cell cycle profiles comparable to that of parental MDA-MB231 cells (3–5% apoptotic cells, 6–13% G2/M phase cells, 5–11% S phase cells, and 75–85% G1 cells). In contrast, MDA-MB231 cells expressing kinase-dead Nek6 showed an accumulation in G2/M phase, together with a reduction of the G1 population (30–35% G2/M phase cells, 8–12% S phase cells, and 30–40% G1 cells). In addition, cells expressing inactive Nek6-KK/MM showed a significant increase in the sub-G1 population, indicative of apoptosis. In repeated experiments we typically observed 20–28% apoptotic cells as determined by propidium iodide staining. Three individual clones were used to repeat the results for each experiment. Similar results were also observed when HeLa stable clones were used (data not shown). These results demonstrate that expression of kinase-dead Nek6 arrests cells in G2/M phase and leads to apoptosis. To determine whether cells expressing Nek6-KK/MM arrest in G2 or in M phase, we used time-lapse microscopy. HeLa Tet-On stable clones in which expression of wild type or Nek6-KK/MM can be induced by the addition of doxycycline were used in these experiments. Fig. 3A shows induction of both wild type and kinase-inactive Nek6 proteins in response to doxycycline. In vitro kinase assays confirmed that the induced wild type protein is active. As expected, no kinase activity was detected for Nek6-KK/MM protein isolated from HeLa Tet-On cells. To visualize the chromosomal DNA in live cells, HeLa Tet-On stable cell lines were transfected with an expression plasmid for green fluorescent protein-histone 2B, which incorporates into chromosomal DNA and allows observation of chromosome actions during cell cycle progression (15Kanda T. Sullivan K.F. Wahl G.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Expression of wild type Nek6 in HeLa cells did not result in any obvious defects during mitosis (data not shown). However, expression of kinase-dead Nek6 caused multiple defects (Fig. 3B). Most of the mitotic cells showed normal chromosome condensation and alignment but were unable to complete mitosis. Time-lapse experiments showed that these cells accumulated at the metaphase stage and were unable to perform chromosome segregation. This failure during mitotic progression frequently leads to the induction of apoptosis. Fig. 3C shows the quantitation from multiple time-lapse experiments with cells overexpressing wild type Nek6 or kinase-dead Nek6-KK/MM. In contrast to wild type-expressing cells, which only showed occasional mitotic defects and apoptosis, almost half of the Nek6-KK/MM-expressing cells apoptosed during mitosis. Careful examination of the video recordings showed that most of the cells undergoing apoptosis had been arrested at the metaphase stage. A smaller fraction of cells initiated apoptosis during anaphase or telephase. Together, the results demonstrate that Nek6 activity is required for progression through mitosis and, in particular, for metaphase-anaphase transition.Fig. 3Time-lapse recording shows that kinase-dead Nek6 inhibits chromosome segregation during mitosis. Stable clones of either wild type or kinase-dead Nek6 in HeLa Tet-On cells were established. Green fluorescent protein-histone 2B DNA was transfected into these stable clones. 18 h after expression of Nek6 was induced with doxycycline (DOX), the cells were used for time-lapse recording for 30 h. A, HeLa tetracycline-inducible cells were induced by the addition of doxycycline. 40 μg of protein of whole cell lysates from stable clones of either wild type or kinase-dead was loaded into each well to perform SDS-PAGE. Anti-HA and anti-α-tubulin Western analysis showed successfully induced Nek6 proteins and a relative similar amount of proteins loaded in each well. Nek6 kinase assays showed Nek6 protein activity after induction. B, mitotic failure and apoptosis of a representative HeLa cell expressing kinase-dead Nek6. The sequence of images shows chromosome condensation and progression to metaphase, which is followed by apoptosis. C, expression of kinase-dead, but not of wild type (WT), Nek6 induces mitotic catastrophe. HeLa cells expressing wild type or kinase-dead Nek6 with or without doxycycline (Dox) induction were followed through mitosis and recorded by time-lapse microscopy. The results shown are the mean (± S.D.) of three independent experiments corresponding to 20 individual cell events in each experiment. Cells that exhibited anaphase, telephase, and metaphase blocks that were followed by apoptosis were scored as mitotic death events; cells that exhibited chromosome fragmentations and apoptosed were scored as other death events.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Knockdown of Endogenous Nek6 by RNA Interference Arrests Cells in M Phase and Triggers Apoptosis in Human Tumor Cells—As the expression of kinase-dead Nek6 induced mitotic arrest and apoptosis, we wished to determine whether there were similar effects upon depletion of endogenous Nek6 protein in cells. We used RNAi as a means of reducing the endogenous level of Nek6 mRNA and protein (11Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8107) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNAs corresponding to two distinct Nek6 coding sequences were chosen to target Nek6, and a lamin A/C RNAi was selected as a nonspecific control. Transfection of either of the two Nek6 siRNAs, but not the control siRNA in HeLa cells, resulted in a significant reduction in Nek6 protein levels as shown in Fig. 4A. HeLa cells transfected with Nek6 siRNA or control siRNA were harvested at different time points and subjected to FACS analysis to assay for DNA contents. Similar to cells expressing kinase-dead Nek6, a knockdown of Nek6 protein by siRNA resulted in a G2/M phase arrest (Fig. 4B). In addition, we observed an increase in the sub-G1 population, indicative of enhanced apoptosis. To further confirm this observation, we assayed induction of apoptosis following transfection of siRNAs over a period of 11 days. Apoptotic cell populations were quantitated in parallel by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining and by propidium iodide staining (Fig. 4C). The data clearly show that depleting Nek6 from the cells induces apoptosis. To confirm that the observed G2/M phase accumulation is due to arrest in M phase, we determined the mitotic index of transfected cells. RNAi-transfected cells were harvested and fixed, then stained with Hoechst to visualize chromosomal DNA. Cells with different nuclear figures were scored and are summarized in Fig. 4, D and E. Consistent with the FACS profile (Fig. 4B) we observed a significant increase in apoptosis in cells transfected with Nek6 siRNA compared with the siRNA control. In addition, we found an increase in the mitotic index, suggesting that the increase in the G2/M cell population observed by propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis is largely because of an accumulation of mitotic cells. In cells transfected with control siRNA, we observed cells in all stages of mitosis (prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telephase). In cells transfected with Nek6 siRNA, however, most of the mitotic cells were in prometa- or metaphase (Fig. 4D). In repeated experiments we rarely found mitotic cells that were in anaphase or telephase (Fig. 4D). Depletion of Nek6 by siRNA also resulted in a significant increase in cells with two or more nuclei, again, suggesting a defect in the proper completion of mitosis (Fig. 4E). Taken together, we conclude that similar to the effects seen with the kinase-dead allele, depletion of endogenous Nek6 induced mitotic arrest and apoptosis. These results further suggest that Nek6 is required for mitotic progression. Mitosis is a critical step within the cell cycle to ensure the accurate distribution of the duplicated chromosomes to the daughter cells. Progression into and through mitosis is associated with distinct patterns of protein phosphorylation and is regulated by various protein kinases and phosphatases. Transition from G2 into M phase requires the activation of the CDK family member Cdc2 (16Draetta G. Beach D. Cell. 1988; 54: 17-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 17Guadagno T.M. Newport J.W. Cell. 1996; 84: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Other kinases with important functions during mitosis are Polo-, Aurora-, and NIMA-related kinases. The results presented here demonstrate that the NIMA-related kinase Nek6 is required for cell cycle progression through mitosis and that loss of Nek6 function results in cell apoptosis. Our results add to the list of serine/threonine kinase families that are required for mitotic progression. Although NIMA has been shown to affect mammalian cell cycle regulation by overexpression, it has not been clear whether functional homologs of NIMA exist in metazoans (18O'Connell M.J. Norbury C. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4926-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Lu K.P. Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 81: 413-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Among the previously characterized mammalian Nek kinases, only Nek2 has been shown to play a role during mitosis, although Nek2 seems mainly to be involved in centrosome separation and does not seem to be required for entry or progression through mitosis (6Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The results presented here establish Nek6 as a mitotic kinase. Its activity is specifically up-regulated during the M phase. Increased activity is also associated with Nek6 phosphorylation, which could be autophosphorylation or activating phosphorylation by an upstream kinase. Furthermore, Nek6 kinase activity is required for progression through mitosis. Blocking Nek6 function, either by expression of an inactive mutant or by siRNA knockdown, resulted in mitotic arrest. The results further demonstrate that Nek6 activity is required after the G2/M phase transition, suggesting a function distinct from NIMA or Nek2, as overexpression of kinase-dead Nek6 did not interfere with chromosome condensation. In time-lapse experiments we observed that cells expressing Nek6-KK/MM were arrested at the metaphase stage. This suggests that Nek6 kinase activity is required for completion of metaphase or for the initiation of anaphase. To ensure the accurate distribution of the sister chromatids, the mitotic checkpoint is activated until all chromosome kinetochores are attached to spindle microtubules. Once this is accomplished, activation of the anaphase-promoting complex then mediates the separation of the sister chromatids, allowing anaphase to proceed (20Musacchio A. Hardwick K.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 21Hoyt M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 909-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is likely that Nek6 kinase activity is required for the recruitment or phosphorylation of mitotic checkpoint components. Several mitotic checkpoint proteins have been shown to regulate mitosis by phosphorylation (22Abrieu A. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Kahana J.A. Peter M. Castro A. Vigneron S. Lorca T. Cleveland D.W. Labbe J.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). At the present time, however, we do not yet know the identity of the critical Nek6 substrate(s) that is required to mediate its effects. It was reported that Nek6 can phosphorylate p70 S6 kinase, but more recent findings suggest that p70 S6 kinase is not an in vivo substrate (7Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Morrice N. Kieloch A. Hastie C.J. Dong L. Schutkowski M. Reimer U. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27839-27849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, Roig et al. (10Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Nek6 forms a complex with Nercc1 (Nek9). Inhibition of Nercc1 by antibody microinjection caused multiple mitotic defects. Dependent on the cell lines examined, inhibition of Nercc1 resulted in spindle abnormalities and mis-segregation of chromosomes or prolonged prometaphase arrest. It is possible that Nek6, as a component of the Nercc1 complex, is involved in some of the Nercc1-dependent effects. Here it should be noted that loss of the entire Nek6 protein, by siRNA transfection, arrested cells earlier than expression of kinase-dead Nek6. siRNA-mediated knockdown predominantly caused cells to be blocked in prometaphase, similar to the reported effect of anti-Nercc1 antibody injection. It is possible that the loss of Nek6 protein interferes with the proper function of the Nercc1 complex or Nercc1 itself. When bound to Nercc1, Nek6 may play a structural role, as expression of kinase-dead Nek6 did not lead to significant prometaphase arrest. As mentioned above, Nek6 kinase activity seems to be critical for metaphase-anaphase transition. It has not yet been established whether the entire pool of cellular Nek6 is in a complex with Nercc1, and the possibility remains that Nek6 also might have Nercc1-independent roles during mitosis. Immunofluorescence with anti-Nek6 or anti-Nercc1 antibodies did not reveal obvious localization of either protein to spindle microtubules or chromosomal structures such as kinetochores (10Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results could indicate that Nek6 and Nercc1 modulate the function of mitotic regulators that do not directly associate with the spindle or the chromosomes. The anti-cancer drug Taxol induces cell apoptosis by stabilizing the spindle microtubules and causing mitotic arrests at the metaphase stage (23Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar). Mitotic block of tumor cells leads to Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation at multiple serines, and Bcl-2 phosphorylation also coincides with the onset of apoptosis by Taxol treatment (24Haldar S. Chintapalli J. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1253-1255PubMed Google Scholar). Several other serine/threonine kinases such as Raf1 and p34cdc2 also have been reported to play a role in mitotic death regulation (25Blagosklonny M.V. Giannakakou P. el-Deiry W.S. Kingston D.G. Higgs P.I. Neckers L. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lee S. Yang W. Lan K.H. Sellappan S. Klos K. Hortobagyi G. Hung M.C. Yu D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5703-5710PubMed Google Scholar). Interfering with Nek6 function not only resulted in mitotic arrest but also induced apoptosis in human tumor cell lines. This was the case for both siRNA transfection and overexpression of kinase-dead Nek6. In siRNA-transfected cells we also observed a significant increase in multinucleated cells indicating that the cells exited mitosis without cell division. These results further demonstrate the requirement for Nek6 in mitosis. Time-lapse microscopy demonstrated that apoptosis occurred as a consequence of the mitotic arrest. Cells arrested by overexpression of Nek6-KK/MM most frequently died after being arrested at the metaphase stage. These observations underscore the fact that human tumor cells cannot tolerate prolonged absence of Nek6 activity. It remains to be determined whether the mitotic arrest produced by interfering with Nek6 function coincides with Bcl-2 or other serine kinase phosphorylation to induce apoptosis. In summary, our data demonstrate that Nek6 kinase activity is up-regulated during the M phase of cell cycle progression. Interference with Nek6 function blocks chromosome segregation at the metaphase-anaphase transition and triggers cell apoptosis. Our studies demonstrate for the first time a critical role for Nek6 in progression through mitosis."

Characterization of the drug binding and ATPase activities of the protein have made it the paradigm ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter. P-glycoprotein has been imaged at low resolution by electron cryo-microscopy and extensively analyzed by disulphide cross-linking, but a high resolution structure solved ab initio remains elusive. Homology models of P-glycoprotein were generated using the structure of a related prokaryotic ABC transporter, the lipid A transporter MsbA, as a template together with structural data describing the dimer interface of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). The first model, which maintained the NBD:transmembrane domain (TMD) interface of MsbA, did not satisfy previously published cross-linking data. This suggests that either P-glycoprotein has a very different structure from MsbA or that the published E. coli MsbA structure does not reflect a physiological state. To distinguish these alternatives, we mapped the interface between the two TMDs of P-glycoprotein experimentally by chemical cross-linking of introduced triple-cysteine residues. Based on these data, a plausible atomic model of P-glycoprotein could be generated using the MsbA template, if the TMDs of MsbA are reoriented with respect to the NBDs. This model will be important for understanding the mechanism of P-glycoprotein and other ABC transporters."

https://openalex.org/W2167827899,"Two-way communication exists between the endocrine and immune systems using molecules such as hormones and cytokines. Here we describe a new pathway by which C3a, a complement-derived cytokine, stimulates anterior pituitary hormone release and activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, a reflex central to the stress response and to the control of inflammation. We show that C3a receptors are expressed in pituitary hormone secreting and non-hormone secreting (folliculostellate) cells and that both C3a and C3adesArg (a non-inflammatory metabolite) stimulate pituitary cell cultures to release prolactin, growth hormone, and adrenocorticotropin. Serum levels of these hormones, together with adrenal corticosterone, increase dose dependently with recombinant C3a and C3adesArg administration in vivo. Pertussis toxin blocks the response to C3a but not C3adesArg, which indicates the presence of two receptors, only one of which is coupled to Galphai-proteins. We propose that the complement innate immune molecules (cytokines) modulate tissue-specific and systemic inflammatory responses through communication with the endocrine pituitary gland."
https://openalex.org/W2057847302,"Cholesterol efflux, an important mechanism by which high density lipoproteins (HDL) protect against atherosclerosis, is initiated by docking of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a major HDL protein, to specific binding sites followed by activation of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and translocation of cholesterol from intracellular compartments to the exofacial monolayer of the plasma membrane where it is accessible to HDL. In this report, we investigated potential signal transduction pathways that may link apoA-I binding to cholesterol translocation to the plasma membrane and cholesterol efflux. By using pull-down assays we found that apoA-I substantially increased the amount of activated Cdc42, Rac1, and Rho in human fibroblasts. Moreover, apoA-I induced actin polymerization, which is known to be controlled by Rho family G proteins. Inhibition of Cdc42 and Rac1 with Clostridium difficile toxin B inhibited apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux, whereas inhibition of Rho with Clostridium botulinum C3-exoenzyme exerted opposite effects. Adenoviral expression of a Cdc42(T17N) dominant negative mutant substantially reduced apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux, whereas dominant negative Rac1(T17N) had no effect. We further found that two downstream effectors of Cdc42/Rac1 signaling, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), are activated by apoA-I. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK but not p38 MAPK decreased apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux, whereas anisomycin and hydrogen peroxide, two direct JNK activators, could partially substitute for apoA-I in its ability to induce cholesterol efflux.

HDL is believed to carry cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for eventual elimination from the body in a process referred to as “reverse cholesterol transport” (1von Eckardstein A.

Biol. 2001; 21: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Cholesterol efflux, in which excess cellular cholesterol is released from cells and transferred to HDL particles, is the first step of reverse cholesterol transport. HDL seems to stimulate cholesterol efflux by two distinct mechanisms (3Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Assmann G. Nofer J.-R. Annu. Rev. Med. 2003; 54: 321-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). One mechanism involves unspecific passive diffusion of cholesterol to the HDL particle. The second mechanism is mediated by interaction of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), either on HDL or as a free apoprotein, with specific binding sites that in turn directly mobilize cholesterol from both intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane.

How exactly HDL or apoA-I activate ABCA1 and thereby initiate cholesterol efflux remains a matter of debate. By analogy to other agonists, cellular signaling responses generated as a result of interaction of apoA-I with cells could provide a link to ABCA1 activation and mobilization of intracellular cholesterol. HDL was shown previously to induce a variety of cellular signals, none of which, with the exception of protein kinase C, could be unequivocally shown to be associated with removal of cellular cholesterol (8Theret N.

Adenoviral Transfection of Fibroblasts—The adenoviral stocks Ad-N17Rac1, Ad-N17Cdc42, and Ad-β-Gal were the generous gifts from Dr. Anne Ridley (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Royal Free and University College School of Medicine, London, UK). The adenoviruses were transfected into 293HEK cells, which express E1 to allow purification of adenoviral particles. The titer of adenoviral stocks was determined by a plaque assay with an anti-hexon antibody (Chemicon). Confluent fibroblasts were infected with Ad-N17Rac1, Ad-N17Cdc42, and Ad-β-Gal at a multiplicity of infection of 6 in medium containing 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. After 90 min of incubation, 0.5 ml of serum-supplemented DMEM was added per 24-well plate, and the incubation was continued for an additional 24 h. Assay for Actin Polymerization—Actin polymerization was quantified as described by Ha and Exton (17Ha K. Exton J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with agonists and fixed with 4% formaldehyde containing 2.5% octyl glucopyranoside for 15 min on ice. Cells were then stained with 0.6 ml/well of 15 nm BODIPY-phalloidin for 30 min, and bound BODIPY-phalloidin was extracted with 0.1 ml of methanol for 1 h on ice. The fluorescence intensity measurements were performed using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorimeter with excitation and emission wavelengths of 505 and 515 nm, respectively. Fluorescence Microscopy—Fibroblasts grown on coverslips were treated with agonists for 5 min. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with BODIPY-phalloidin as described above. Coverslips were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Leica) equipped with an excitation filter (470-490 nm), a dichroic mirror (505 nm), and an emission filter (515 nm). Pull-down Assay for Cdc42, Rac1, and Rho Activation—Stimulated fibroblasts were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 8 mmol/liter EGTA, 8 mmol/liter EDTA, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter orthovanadate, and the Complete® protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were homogenized by three thaw-freeze cycles, cleared by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 4 °C), and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 μg/sample of GST-PBD beads for Cdc42 or Rac1 precipitation or with GST-rhotekin beads for Rho precipitation. The beads were collected by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 4 °C) and washed, and captured proteins were removed by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to Western blotting with antibodies against Cdc42, Rac1, and Rho. Measurement of GTP/GDP Exchange—Measurement of GTP/GDP exchange was performed in permeabilized fibroblasts as described by de Vries-Smits et al. (18de Vries-Smits A.M. van der Voorn J. Downwatd J. Bos L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and Downward (19Downward J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, confluent and serum-starved fibroblasts were stimulated with apoA-I (10 μg/ml) or LPA (20 μg/ml) for 1 min (Cdc42) or 10 min (Rac1). Cells were then cooled rapidly by addition of ice-cold buffer containing 150 mmol/liter glutamate, 20 mmol/liter PIPES, 2 mmol/liter EGTA, 2 mmol/liter EDTA (pH 7.0), and exposed to streptolysin O (100 haemolytic units/ml) in the same buffer containing ATP (2.2 mmol/liter) and Mg2+(1 mmol/liter) for 10 min at 4 °C. Permeabilization by streptolysin O was induced by addition of buffer containing free Ca2+ (15 μmol/liter) at 37 °C. GTPγ[35S] (2.5 μCi/ml) was added immediately thereafter for 30 min. Cells were washed and lysed, and lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight with monoclonal antibodies against Cdc42 and Rac1 or with irrelevant antibody (2 μg/probe). GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac1 were eluted from immunoprecipitates with Laemmli buffer at 68 °C for 20 min. Recovered radioactivities were measured by scintillation counting. Data were normalized to protein content of each sample. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed exactly as described previously (14Nofer J.-R. Levkau B. Wolinska I. Junker R. Fobker M. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34480-34486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). For each blot with anti-phosphospecific antibodies loading controls were performed using an antibody against a ubiquitously expressed protein (α-actin). PAK-1 Immunoprecipitation—Fibroblasts were incubated in phosphate-free Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 0.1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h at 37 °C and stimulated with agonists. Cells were then scraped into 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 2 mmol/liter EGTA, 25 mmol/liter NaF, 10 mmol/liter Na4P2O7, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete® protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with protein A/G-agarose. The immunoprecipitation with 1-2 μg of anti-PAK-1 antibody/500 μg of protein was performed overnight, and the phosphorylation of PAK-1 was analyzed by autoradiography after proteins were captured by incubation for 2 h with protein A/G-agarose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated PAK-1 protein were confirmed by Western blotting. Efflux of Cellular Cholesterol—Cholesterol efflux was measured according to established methods. Briefly, [3H]cholesterol (1 μCi/well) was added to cells grown in 24-well plates for 24 h. Cells were washed and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with DMEM containing BSA (0.2%, v/v) and apoA-I at desired concentrations. The efflux medium was collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Cells were solubilized in 0.1 m NaOH. Radioactivity in efflux media and cell lysates was determined by scintillation counting. The results are reported as percentage of efflux relative to the radioactivity fraction present in efflux medium in the absence of apoA-I. General Procedures—Data are presented as means ± S.D. form three separate experiments or as representative immunoblots for at least three repetitions, unless indicated otherwise. ApoA-I Induces Actin Polymerization in Human Fibroblasts—Rho family G proteins (Cdc42/Rac/Rho) regulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to extracellular signals. Therefore, we first examined the effect of apoA-I on the actin polymerization. Actin polymers were visualized with a BODIPY-phalloidin and observed under a fluorescence microscope. No polymerized actin could be seen in serum-starved cells (Fig. 1A). However, exposure of fibroblasts to 10 μg/ml apoA-I was accompanied by the appearance of intracellular actin fibers. The changes were evident after 1 min and reached maximum after ∼5 min. LPA, a compound inducing actin polymerization in various cell systems, evoked similar morphological changes as apoA-I (Fig. 1A). To investigate the time and concentration dependence of apoA-I-induced actin polymerization, BODIPY-phalloidin bound to actin fibers was extracted, and the fluorescence was measured. ApoA-I rapidly increased the intracellular content of polymerized actin with a maximum at 5 min after stimulation. The levels decreased steadily afterward and reached basal levels after 30 min. The maximal stimulation was seen at an apoA-I concentration of ∼5 μg/ml. ApoA-I stimulated actin polymerization about half as effectively as 20 μg/ml LPA. ApoA-I Activates Small G Proteins Cdc42 and Rac1—The induction of actin polymerization in the presence of apoA-I suggested the involvement of Cdc42/Rac/Rho proteins in this process. To assess directly whether apoA-I affects the activity of the Rho family G proteins, we examined the amount of activated Cdc42 and Rac1 in fibroblasts treated with apoA-I. The GST-PBD beads precipitated only marginal amounts of Cdc42 and Rac1 from unstimulated fibroblasts. By contrast, exposure of cells to 10 μg/ml apoA-I caused a strong increase in the amounts of both active Cdc42 and Rac1. However, both GTPases showed clearly distinctive activation kinetics. Whereas maximal activation of Cdc42 was detectable after 5-10 min of apoA-I exposure, Rac1 activation reached its maximum 30 min after stimulation. The comparison of the apoA-I-induced Cdc42/Rac1 response with that of 20 μg/ml LPA showed that apoA-I was able to cause a substantial stimulation of G proteins. The activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 is regulated either by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which catalyze exchange of GDP into GTP and mediate activation, or may result from inhibition of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate GTP hydrolysis leading to inactivation. To investigate the possible involvement of GEFs and GAPs in apoA-I-induced Cdc42 and Rac1 activation, we investigated the GTP loading of Cdc42 and Rac1 after stimulation with apoA-I. Permeabilized fibroblasts were incubated with non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, GTPγS, in the presence apoA-I (10 μg/ml) or LPA (20 μg/ml), and Cdc42 or Rac1 was immunoprecipitated afterward. As shown in Fig. 1C, the exposure of fibroblasts to apoA-I for 1 or 10 min markedly increased the amount of GTPγS associated with Cdc42 or Rac1, respectively. Similar but more pronounced effects were seen after treating fibroblasts with LPA. These results indicate that apoA-I promotes guanine nucleotide exchange in Cdc42 and Rac1. The results described above indicated the possibility that apoA-I activated Ser/Thr kinase PAK-1, which is known to associate with and to be activated by GTP-bound Cdc42 and/or Rac1. Therefore, we extended our investigation to measure the activity of PAK-1 in apoA-I-stimulated cells. To this end, we exploited the property of PAK-1 to autophosphorylate upon activation by extracellular signals. As shown in Fig. 1D, exposure of fibroblasts to apoA-I led to phosphorylation of PAK-1, which was detectable 1 min after stimulation. The apoA-I-induced PAK-1 activation was concentration-dependent reaching a maximum at an apoA-I concentration of 10 μg/ml. Involvement of ApoA-I-induced Cdc42 and Rac1 Activation in Cholesterol Efflux—To test whether apoA-I-induced activation of G proteins could be involved in cholesterol efflux, we used C. difficile toxin B, an enzyme that inactivates the Rho family G proteins by glycosylating them at a critical threonine residue. As sensitivity toward toxin B varies considerably among various cell lines, we first performed controls to assess whether toxin B effectively inhibited GTPases under our experimental conditions. Fig. 2A shows that preincubation of fibroblasts for 2 h with 50 ng/ml toxin B markedly reduced the apoA-I-induced activation of both Cdc42 and Rac1 as well as PAK-1 autophosphorylation. To verify these results with an independent method, we measured apoA-I-induced actin polymerization and found that it was suppressed in toxin B-pretreated cells (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined whether a similar pretreatment with toxin B could affect the apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux. As shown in Fig. 2B, addition of apoA-I for 4 h to human fibroblasts led to a concentration-dependent efflux of cellular cholesterol into the cell medium. The maximal efflux was observed at an apoA-I concentration of 10 μg/ml. In the absence of apoA-I, toxin B treatment did not affect cholesterol efflux. However, toxin B significantly mitigated the apoA-I-evoked cholesterol efflux; in five experiments ∼70% reduction in the overall response was observed. As toxin B inhibits both Cdc42 and Rac1, it does not allow the discrimination between the effects of each of these G proteins. To estimate the contribution of Cdc42 and Rac1 to apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux, we used metabolically inactive dominant negative mutants, which specifically inhibit different subclasses of small G proteins. As shown in Fig. 2C, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Cdc42(T17N) and Rac1(T17N) led to complete inhibition of apoA-I-induced Cdc42 and Rac1 activation, respectively. In cells overexpressing dominant negative Cdc42(T17N), the reduction of apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux corresponded to an ∼60% decrease in the overall response. By contrast, adenoviral introduction of the dominant negative Rac1(T17N) into fibroblasts had no impact on the apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux. Lack of Involvement of Rho Activation in ApoA-I-induced Cholesterol Efflux—In addition to Cdc42 and Rac1, Rho proteins were shown to participate in actin polymerization by extracellular signals. Therefore, we next examined the influence of apoA-I on Rho activation. As shown in Fig. 3A, only small amounts of active Rho could be precipitated by rhotekin-GST beads from lysates of untreated fibroblasts. By contrast, exposure of cells to apoA-I (10 μg/ml) led to a marked increase in the amount of active Rho, which was detectable 1 min after addition of an agonist and persisted throughout the entire length of stimulation. Activated Rho has been demonstrated to inhibit the myosin light chain phosphatase thereby causing phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLC). To provide further evidence for apoA-I-induced activation of Rho, we examined the effect of apoA-I on MLC phosphorylation. Fig. 3A demonstrates that the exposure of fibroblasts to apoA-I led to MLC phosphorylation in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. The maximal MLC phosphorylation was detected at 10 μg/ml apoA-I. Next, we evaluated whether apoA-I-induced Rho activation and MLC phosphorylation are related to the efflux of intracellular cholesterol. To this goal, we used C. botulinum C3-exoenzyme that specifically inactivates Rho but not Cdc42 or Rac1. In addition, we used compound Y27632, an inhibitor of MLC phosphorylation. First, the efficiency of both inhibitors in our experimental system was verified. As shown in Fig. 3B, treatment of cells with 5 μg/ml C3-exoenzyme for 12 h substantially reduced the amount of activated Rho, which could be precipitated from apoA-I-stimulated fibroblasts. Similarly, preincubation of fibroblasts for 30 min with 10 μmol/liter Y27632 abolished apoA-I-induced MLC phosphorylation. The effect of both compounds on apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux is shown in Fig. 3B. Increasing concentrations of C3-exoenzyme enhanced whereas increasing concentrations of Y27632 had no effect on apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux. Effect of ApoA-I on Activation of JNK and p38 MAPK—The downstream effectors linked to the activation Cdc42 and Rac1 include several hierarchically organized kinases as follows: phosphorylation of MKK4 activates JNK, which in turn phosphorylates transcription factor c-Jun, whereas phosphorylation of MKK3/6 induces consecutive phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAPK and transcription factor Elk-1. The transcription factor ATF-2 is phosphorylated by both JNK and p38 MAPK. We were interested to examine whether apoA-I-induced activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 is associated with activation of JNK and p38 MAPK signaling cascades in human fibroblasts. The activation status of the signaling elements in both cascades was examined by using antibodies specifically reacting with phosphorylated epitopes. As shown in Fig. 4A, exposure of fibroblasts to 10 μg/ml apoA-I led to a phosphorylation/activation of both MKK4/JNK/c-Jun and MKK3/6/p38 MAPK/Elk-1 signaling cascades with the onset of activity at 1 min and the maximum at 10-30 min after stimulation. In addition, apoA-I stimulated phosphorylation of ATF-2. The effect of apoA-I on kinase activation was concentration-dependent with the phosphorylations detectable at 1 μg/ml apoA-I. To determine whether apoA-I-induced activation of JNK and p38 MAPK was causally linked to Cdc42/Rac1 activation, we examined the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK after inhibition of Rho family small G proteins with toxin B. As shown in Fig. 4B, apoA-I-induced phosphorylations of JNK and p38 MAPK were both markedly attenuated in fibroblasts pretreated with 50 ng/ml toxin B. We next investigated whether signaling via JNK or p38 MAPK was related to apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux. To this end, we pretreated fibroblasts for 30 min with increasing concentrations of the following inhibitors: JNKI-2 to selectively block JNK, SB202190 to inhibit p38 MAPK, and PD169316, an inhibitor with dual selectivity for both JNK and p38 MAPK. As shown in Fig. 4C, JNKI-2 and PD169316 at concentrations 10 and 50 μmol/liter, respectively, completely blocked JNK activation by 10 μg/ml apoA-I. ApoA-I-induced p38 MAPK activation was effectively blocked by 10 μmol/liter SB202190. In the applied concentration ranges, JNKI-2 exerted no effects on p38 MAPK activation, and SB202190 exerted no effects on JNK activation (not shown). PD169313 effectively inhibited p38 MAPK activation at concentrations 10 times lower than those required for the inhibition of JNK (not shown). The examination of the effect of inhibitors on apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux revealed that pretreatment of fibroblasts with JNKI-2 or PD169316 in concentrations found to block apoA-I-induced JNK activation led to an ∼50-60% decrease in cholesterol efflux. By contrast, SB202190 at a concentration inhibiting apoA-I-induced p38 MAPK activation exerted no effect on cholesterol efflux (Fig. 4C). Effect of Direct JNK Activation on Cholesterol Efflux—The potential role of JNK in cholesterol efflux was further examined using anisomycin and hydrogen peroxide, two compounds commonly used to directly activate JNK. As shown in Fig. 5A, stimulation of fibroblasts with anisomycin or hydrogen peroxide led to a time- and concentration-dependent activation of JNK. Within the same concentration range, both compounds induced cholesterol efflux (Fig. 5B). To test whether stimulatory effects of anisomycin and hydrogen peroxide were indeed related to JNK stimulation, we examined the effect of both compounds on JNK activation and cholesterol efflux in fibroblasts pretreated with 10 mmol/liter JNKI-2 or 50 μmol/liter PD169316. As shown in Fig. 5C, both inhibitors effectively blocked JNK activation and cholesterol efflux evoked by exposure of fibroblasts to 50 μmol/liter anisomycin or 0.5 mmol/liter hydrogen peroxide. HDL has been shown to activate a multitude of intracellular signaling pathways including kinases (i.e. protein kinase C, ERK1/2, and Akt) (8Theret N. Delbart C. Aguie G. Fruchart J.D. Vassaux G.

Whereas much effort has been focused on sugars and amino acids, the identification of other significant metabolites is equally important for comprehensive characterization of metabolic interactions between plants and biotrophic fungal pathogens. Employing a strategy of targeted gene disruption, we generated a mutant strain (gpdhΔ) defective in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in a hemibiotrophic plant pathogen, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f.sp. malvae. The gpdhΔ strain had severe defects in carbon utilization as it could use neither glucose nor amino acids for sustained growth.

This study provides strong evidence for a role of glycerol as a significant transferred metabolite from plant to fungal pathogen. Considerable attention has been focused on nutrient uptake in a wide variety of biotrophic associations between plants and microbes (1.Mendgen K. Hahn M. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2.Parniske M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To address this topic, several experimental approaches have been pursued, most involving either the axenic culturing of fungal pathogens to examine the requirements of particular nutrients, or the feeding of the plant host with radiolabeled metabolites followed by analysis of label distribution in the pathogen (3.Mendgen K. Phytopathology. 1981; 71: 983-989Crossref Google Scholar). Efforts to date have identified amino acids and sugars as basic carbon requirements for pathogen metabolism (4.Stables R.C. Ledbetter M.C.

Recent progress on the molecular cloning of hexose and amino acid transporters localized in the haustorial plasma membrane of rust have further advanced our understanding of the mechanistic details of fungal nutrient uptake (10.Stables R.C. Trend Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 496-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11.Hahn M. Neef U. Struck C. Gottfert M. Mendgen K. Mol.

A. 2001; 98: 8133-8813Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, uncertainty still exists as to what other metabolites also serve as significant carbon and energy sources in sustaining biotrophic fungal growth. The filamentous ascomycete Colletotrichum is a large group of fungi, which cause serious anthracnose disease in many plant species (13.Agrios G.N. Plant Pathology, 4th Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997Google Scholar). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f.sp. malvae is a hemibiotrophic pathogen that is biotrophic for a period of time before causing necrosis to its host, the round-leaved mallow (Malva pusilla). During vegetative growth, conidiation is initiated, beginning with the production of aerial conidiophores that eventually bud to give rise to the conidia. During the infection process, C. gloeosporioides conidia germinate on the host surface and form an elaborate and highly specialized infection structure called the appressorium. The appressorium employs a turgor-based mechanical force that mediates the direct penetration of a narrow penetration peg through the host cuticle and epidermal layer (14.Mendgen K. Hahn M. Deising H. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1996; 34: 367-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). After hyphal penetration of an epidermal cell, the fungus develops intracellular infection vesicles that produce large primary hyphae (LPH). 1The abbreviations used are: LPH, large primary hyphae; GPDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Gly-3-P, glycerol 3-phosphate; PDA, potato dextrose agar; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; hpi, hours post-inoculation. The LPH ramify throughout the apoplast of the leaf tissue, giving rise to the thin secondary hyphae. This generation of thin secondary hyphae from LPH has been associated with the conversion from biotrophic growth to necrotrophic infection by C. gloeosporioides. A necrotic lesion develops, and under conditions of high humidity, C. gloeosporioides produces acervuli that erupt into the cuticle and release conidia to reinitiate the infection cycle (15.Wei Y.D. Byer K.N. Goodwin P.H. Mycol. Res. 1997; 101: 357-364Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unlike obligate biotrophic pathogens, a C. gloeosporioides culture can be readily established in media, displaying robust growth and a normal conidiation process. C. gloeosporioides is amendable to gene disruption and thus to studying fungal metabolism and pathogenicity. In the present study, we set out to investigate the metabolic and developmental significance of C. gloeosporioides glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) (l-glycerol-3-phosphate: NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8), which catalyzes the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate using NADH as a reducing equivalent to form glycerol 3-phosphate (Gly-3-P). Disruption of the GPDH gene (Cg-GPDH) in C. gloeosporioides resulted in an altered morphology of fungal hyphae and a failure to initiate conidiation when cultured on medium plates. The gene disruption strain was unable to use either glucose or pyruvate as the sole carbon source, and utilized amino acids poorly in defined culture medium plates. However, glycerol as a carbon source efficiently sustained the growth of the mutant on minimal medium. Conidia derived from gpdhΔ grown on glycerol-supplemented plates, once inoculated into plants, developed normal appressoria and displayed normal pathogenicity in plants. Most significantly, in planta, gpdhΔ was fully capable of initiating conidiation. We provide several lines of evidence in this study for a hitherto unknown role of glycerol as a nutrient transferred from plant to pathogen. Fungal Strains and Growth Conditions—C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. f.sp. malvae, kindly provided by Dr. Karen Bailey, was maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). Fresh PDA plates were inoculated with mycelial plugs of 3-mm diameter and incubated for 8 days at 24 °C to promote conidiation. Growth tests on plates were carried out on fungal minimal media modified from Czapek's medium (0.2% NaNO3, 0.1% K2HPO4, 0.05% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05% KCl, 0.001% FeSO4, and 1.5% agar) and carbon sources were added at final concentrations of 10 mm unless indicated otherwise. In bioassays of rhythmic growth, plugs of 2-mm diameter were cut from the margins of actively growing colonies and were then used to inoculate the center of PDA plates in 9-cm diameter Petri dishes. The cultures were entrained to a 12:12-h light/dark cycle. The rhythmic periods were determined by monitoring daily colony growth from positions marked on the reverse of the plate. Bacterial Strains and Functional Complementation Study—Escherichia coli gpsA strain BB20-14 (gpsA20 glpD phoA8χ) was kindly provided by Dr. John Cronan Jr., Department of Microbiology and Biochemistry, University of Illinois. Standard recombinant DNA experiments were carried out using E. coli strain DH5α. Growth of the BB20-14 strain is dependent on supplementation of Gly-3-P or glycerol. The minimal medium used for the E. coli BB20-14 strain was M9 (16.Morbidoni H.R. de Mendoza D. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5899-5905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid preparation and mass conversion of the phage library to the plasmid library were performed according to standard protocols (17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids generated from a cDNA library constructed using mRNA isolated from mallow leaves infected with C. gloeosporioides at 72 h post-inoculation (18.Wei Y. Periappuram C. Datla R. Selvaraj G. Zou J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 39: 841-848Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were introduced into E. coli BB20-14 cells, and transformed cells were grown on M9 basal medium plates in the presence of 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Colonies that gained the ability to grow on M9 medium were isolated, purified, and used for further analysis. Nucleic Acid Isolation, Manipulation, and Hybridization—Fungal conidia and mycelia grown on PDA plates from 15-day-old cultures were scraped and stored at -80 °C. Mallow leaves infected with C. gloeosporioides were harvested at 3 days post-inoculation and used for isolation of DNA and RNA. Fungal and plant materials were ground under liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. Genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted according to Ausubel et al. (19.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

A Laboratory Guide to RNA: Isolation, Analysis, and Synthesis. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 21-41Google Scholar), respectively. DNA hybridization probes were prepared using the Random Primer-It kit (Stratagene). Southern and Northern blotting and hybridizations were carried out according to the methods of Sambrook et al. (17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI377 automated sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA/protein sequence data bases were searched using the BLAST algorithm via the World Wide Web. Fungal Transformation and Gene Disruption—Conidia from 6-day-old cultures grown on PDA plates were transferred to distilled water with a bacterial loop, washed twice, and harvested by centrifugation. Conidia were transferred and resuspended in a 250-ml flask with 100 ml of liquid medium (0.25% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.27% KH2PO4, 0.1% peptone, 0.1% yeast extract, and 1.0% sucrose) (21.Redman R.S. Rodriguez R.J. Exp. Mycol. 1994; 18: 230-246Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and grown for 48 h at 22 °C with constant agitation (120 rpm). Mycelia incubated in liquid medium for 48 h were harvested by filtration through two layers of cheesecloth, washed with 0.6 m MgSO4, and used for fungal protoplast preparation. Competent protoplasts were prepared from mycelia of C. gloeosporioides by a modification of the method of Yelton et al. (22.Yelton M.M. Hamer J.E. Timberlake W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mycelia from liquid medium were resuspended in osomotic medium (5 ml/g of mycelium) (22.Yelton M.M. Hamer J.E. Timberlake W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing Novozyme 234 (20 mg/g of mycelium) and β-glucuronidase (0.2 ml/g of mycelium). The cells were digested on a rotary shaker at 80 rpm for 1.5–3 h at 30 °C. The suspension was transferred to a centrifuge tube, overlaid gently with 5 ml of ST buffer, and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protoplasts were withdrawn with a widebore pipette, and subsequently washed and resuspended in STC buffer (22.Yelton M.M. Hamer J.E. Timberlake W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a concentration of 1 × 108 ml-1. Plasmid pCg-GPDH, pBluescript™ SK containing the cDNA insert of the C. gloeosporioides Cg-GPDH bearing an internal BglII site, was linearized by digestion with BglII, and Klenow enzyme was used to create blunt ends. Plasmid pAN7-2 (23.Punt P.J. van den Hondel C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), which contains a hygromycin-B resistance cassette comprised of the coding sequence of hygromycin-B phosphotransferase (hph) from E. coli, the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA promoter sequence, and the A. nidulans trpC terminator sequence, was digested with BglII and HindIII. The excised fragment was blunt-ended and subsequently ligated into the linearized plasmid pCg-GPDH to create plasmid pGPDHΔ. The vector DNA (10 μg in 20 μl of STC) linearized by digestion with XbaI was added to 200 μl of competent protoplasts, mixed, and incubated on ice for 20 min. The protoplast/DNA combination was mixed with 150 μl of PEG solution (20% PEG 6,000, 1 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm CaCl2) and incubated on ice for 10 min. 1 ml of PEG solution was added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for a further 5 min. 200-μl aliquots from each transformation experiment were mixed with 5 ml of 45 °C molten top complete medium (27.4% sucrose, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.2% Bacto-casitone and 0.8% agarose) and overlaid onto 20-ml complete medium plates. Plates were incubated at 25 °C overnight, then overlaid with 5 ml of complete medium containing hygromycin-B at 100 μg/ml and incubated at 25 °C for 5 to 10 days. Hygromycin-B-resistant colonies were monitored and subcultured onto PDA medium amended with 100 μg/ml hygromycin-B. Lipid Analysis—Fungal mycelia developed on PDA plates with and without 10 mm glycerol were harvested for total lipid extraction (24.Foch J.M. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TLC separation of phospholipid species, and fatty acid composition analysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were performed as described (25.Zheng Z. Zou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41710-41716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Glycerol 3-Phosphate and Glycerol Content Analysis—Gly-3-P content in trichloroacetic acid extracts (26.Jelitto T. Sonnewald U. Willmitzer L. Hajirezeai M. Stitt M. Planta (Basel). 1992; 188: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was measured enzymatically using glycerophosphate dehydrogenase as described by Lang (27.Lang G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. VI. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 525-531Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture containing 0.5 m glycine, 0.4 m hydrazine buffer (pH 9.5), 1 mm NAD+, and 1 unit of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma). Glycerol content analysis was performed using a glycerol determination kit from Roche Diagnostics. Assay for Appressorium Turgor—50-μl droplets of conidial suspensions, at concentrations of 105 ml-1, of wild-type (wt) and the gpdhΔ mutant harvested from PDA plates supplemented with 250 mm glycerol, were placed on the surface of plastic coverslides (Fisher Scientific) and left in a humid environment at 25 °C. Mature appressoria at 48 h postincubation were employed for measuring appressorial turgor pressure using a cytorrhysis assay as described by Howard et al. (28.Howard R.J. Ferrari M.A. Roach D.H. Money N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11281-11284Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and Dixon et al. (29.Dixon K.P. Xu J.R. Smirnoff N. Talbot N.J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2045-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Inoculation and Pathogenicity Test—Round-leaved mallow (M. pusilla), the host plant for C. gloeosporioides f.sp. malvae, was grown in a growth chamber at 25 °C. The third leaves from the top of one-month-old plants were excised and used for the pathogenicity assay. The detached leaves were inoculated with 15 μl of the conidial suspension (5 × 105 conidia ml-1) and incubated on moist filter paper in a plastic box at 25 °C in the dark. The inoculated leaves were monitored daily for 7 to 10 days. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Droplets of PDA medium were placed on plastic coverslides (Fisher Scientific) and allowed to dry under a sterile flow of air, forming a thin film. 15 μl of the conidial suspensions of the wild-type strain and the gpdhΔ mutant harvested from PDA plates supplemented with 250 mm glycerol were placed on the centers of the PDA films. These slides bearing inoculated PDA films were incubated in Petri dishes at 25 °C for 3–7 days. The fungus grown on the film was fixed in an ethanol/acetic acid (1:1) solution at room temperature overnight. The fixed material was subjected to S.E. ± mean examination. Light Microscopy—Leaf tissues were fixed and decolorized in an ethanol/acetic acid (1:1) solution at room temperature overnight. Visualization of germlings and infection hyphae on/in the leaf surface was facilitated by staining for 5 min with 0.1% aniline blue in lactoglycerol (lactic acid/glycerol/water (1:1:1)) followed by a brief rinse in lactoglycerol. The stained leaf sections were then mounted in lactoglycerol for microscopy. Molecular Cloning of a GPDH cDNA from C. gloeosporioides—We adapted a complementation-based screening procedure to isolate the GPDH cDNA from C. gloeosporioides using an E. coli mutant strain, BB20-14, which is unable to synthesize Gly-3-P because of a loss-of-function mutation in the gpsA gene encoding an NAD(P)H-dependent GPDH, and cannot grow on basal medium without glycerol or Gly-3-P supplement (18.Wei Y. Periappuram C. Datla R. Selvaraj G. Zou J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 39: 841-848Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A cDNA library was constructed with mRNA prepared from infected mallow leaves at 72 h post-inoculation with C. gloeosporioides. The library thus contains cDNA populations derived from both the plant tissue and the pathogen (30.Wei Y. Shih J. Li J. Goodwin P.H. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2149-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Plasmids excised in vivo from the phage library were used to transform the E. coli BB20-14 strain. Twenty-one colonies that gained the ability to grow on basal medium without glycerol supplementation were isolated. Southern blot analysis and PCR amplification using gene specific primers confirmed that a group of plasmids, designated as pCg-GPDH (deposited into EMBL under accession number AY331190) was derived from the fungus. The Cg-GPDH transcript encodes a protein of 420 amino acid residues, contains a predicted NAD+ binding domain, and shows a high degree of homology to a recently reported GPDH (GPD1) sequence from A. nidulans (31.Fillinger S. Ruijter G. Tamás M.J. Visser J. Thevelein J.M. d'Enfert C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The sequence information and the functional complementation result led us to conclude that Cg-GPDH corresponds to a GPDH gene from C. gloeosporioides. Southern blot analysis of C. gloeosporioides with the full-length Cg-GPDH cDNA as a probe revealed only a single hybridization band in EcoRI, EcoRV, and HindIII-digested genomic DNA (Fig. 1A), suggesting Cg-GPDH is a single copy gene. Northern blot analysis identified a 1.7-kb transcript of approximately equal abundance in mycelia and spores harvested from PDA plates (Fig. 1B). A transcript of the same size was also detected from total RNA extracted from infected mallow leaves (data not shown). Therefore, Cg-GPDH is expressed at all stages of C. gloeosporioides development. Targeted Gene Disruption in Cg-GPDH Affects Fungal Morphology and Disrupts Conidiation under Standard Culture Conditions—To determine the functional significance of Cg-GPDH in C. gloeosporioides, a gene disruption strategy was employed. An XbaI-linearized gene disruption vector, pGPDHΔ, containing a hygromycin-resistance gene cassette flanked by 5′ and 3′ ends of the Cg-GPDH cDNA (Fig. 2, A and B) was introduced into the wild-type strain and HygR transformants were selected. Among 180 HygR transformants, two (GDDH41Δ and GDDH63Δ) were confirmed by PCR analysis to have the endogenous Cg-GPDH gene disrupted. There was an increase in the amplicon size from 601 bp for the uninterrupted gene to 4.5 kb for the interrupted version (Fig. 2C). This was also confirmed by Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA of the two mutants digested with several restriction enzymes (data not shown). The strain GDDH41Δ, hereafter referred to as gpdhΔ, was used for further study. The targeted gene disruption abolished Cg-GPDH expression as shown by the lack of Cg-GPDH transcript in mycelia (Fig. 2D). The PDA plate provides a standard culture medium sufficient for all stages of C. gloeosporioides development (30.Wei Y. Shih J. Li J. Goodwin P.H. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2149-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). During early stages of growth, the gpdhΔ strain displayed a slightly slower mycelial growth rate and poorly developed aerial hyphae on PDA plates as compared with wild-type. Colonies of the wild-type strain and gpdhΔ could also be distinguished based on pigmentation. Heavy melanization caused increased pigmentation and hence a darker appearance in gpdhΔ. Microscopic examination revealed abnormal hyphae along the edge of the gpdhΔ colony, which displayed swelling in the branching regions similar to the phenotype described previously in the A. nidulans gfdA mutant (31.Fillinger S. Ruijter G. Tamás M.J. Visser J. Thevelein J.M. d'Enfert C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On PDA plates, the wild-type strain readily developed conidiophores and produced abundant conidia that appeared pink in color (Fig. 3A, a). The gpdhΔ strain, however, was unable to conidiate on the same rich medium even after prolonged culture (Fig. 3A, b). To further investigate this developmental defect, gpdhΔ and the wild-type strains were cultured on dried PDA droplets on plastic coverslides incubated in a Petri dish (for 3 days), and subjected to scanning electron microscopic examination. In contrast to the wild-type strain, which generated acervuli with abundant conidia, the gpdhΔ strain produced aborted acervuli as indicated by the presence of lone setae with no conidia (Fig. 3B). The gpdhΔ Strain Has Reduced Gly-3-P and Glycerol Content and Altered Fatty Acid Composition of Glycerolipids—A lack of GPDH is expected to have a direct impact on Gly-3-P generation. Because GPDH is also coupled to glycerol metabolism, the mutation may also affect glycerol production. We thus analyzed glycerol and Gly-3-P content of gpdhΔ and wild-type mycelia grown on PDA medium. As shown in Fig. 4A, deletion of the Cg-GPDH gene resulted in a severe reduction of the cellular Gly-3-P level. Accordingly, the glycerol content of the gpdhΔ strain was also diminished to about one-eighth of that of the wild-type strain (Fig. 4B). The low levels of glycerol and Gly-3-P detected in the mutant strain are most likely attributable to the composition of the PDA culturing medium. Gly-3-P is an obligatory substrate for the synthesis of glycerolipids from which phospholipids are formed by the addition of one of several polar head groups. The most abundant phospholipid species are PC and PE. In the A. nidulans mutant defective in GPDH activity, it was reported that there was no change in the cellular ratio of phospholipid species. However, a limited Gly-3-P provision would likely reduce the overall rate of glycerolipid assembly, and not affect the relative proportions of different phospholipid species. More likely, reduced glycerolipid biosynthesis, and hence a reduced incorporation of fatty acids into lipid species, would permit the fatty acids of the fatty acyl-CoA pool to be further modified, such as an increase in desaturation. Such a change could be detected through analysis of the fatty acid composition of the abundantly existing phospholipids. We thus purified PC and PE from the gpdhΔ and wild-type strains grown on PDA medium and analyzed their fatty acid compositions. Observed were decreased proportions of stearic acid (18:0) and linolenic acid (18:3), and a corresponding increase in linoleic acid (18:2). The most dramatic change, however, was seen at the level of Δ11-oleic acid (18:1Δ11). PC and PE from the wild-type strain contained only trace amounts of 18:1Δ11, at a level of less than 1%. Significantly, the molar ratio of this fatty acid, although still a minor component, was severalfold higher in gpdhΔ as compared with the wild-type strain. This fatty acid change can be ascribed to a lack of cellular Gly-3-P because the 18:1Δ11 content in PC and PE of gpdhΔ growing on PDA plates supplemented with glycerol was reduced to a level close to that of the wild-type (Fig. 4C). Mycelium Growth of the gpdhΔ Strain on Minimal Medium Requires a Glycerol/Gly-3-P Supplement—We investigated the growth of the gpdhΔ strain on chemically defined minimal media containing various carbon sources, because the GPDH reaction is only one step away from the glycolytic pathway and may therefore affect carbon source utilization. Glucose (12.Voegele R.T. Struck C. Hahn M. Mendgen K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8133-8813Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and amino acids (2.Parniske M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) are two confirmed carbon sources significant in biotrophic nutrition. When glucose, pyruvate, glycine, glutamate, and histidine were each provided at a concentration of 10 mm, as the sole carbon source in a minimal medium, the wild-type strain showed an optimum growth rate with glucose, and slightly reduced growth rates with all other carbon sources. None of the aforementioned carbon sources could sustain colony growth of the gpdhΔ strain (Fig. 5). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate was also tested as a carbon source, but it could be utilized by neither the wild-type nor mutant strains. Contrary to what was reported regarding A. nidulans (31.Fillinger S. Ruijter G. Tamás M.J. Visser J. Thevelein J.M. d'Enfert C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the presence of an osmotic stabilizer (1 m NaCl) in the medium did not have any impact on carbon source utilization in the gpdhΔ strain. Strikingly, both wild-type and the gpdhΔ strain grew robustly on minimal media plates containing 10 mm glycerol. Gly-3-P can be utilized by the wild-type strain to support growth at an optimum concentration of 1 mm, beyond which a significant reduction in growth rate is observed. At the optimum concentration of 1 mm, Gly-3-P could also support gpdhΔ growth, but at a rate dramatically lower than that of the wild-type strain. We further examined the concentration of glycerol required to support fungal growth by performing growth assays for both the wild-type and mutant strains on minimal medium supplied with various concentrations of glycerol. No significant difference in the growth rate (colony diameter/incubation period) was observed on plates containing between 10 and 1 mm glycerol for either of the strains. We also found that glycerol at as low as 100 μm in the medium supports a substantial growth of the fungus, but at a markedly reduced rate. Glycerol Is a Metabolite That Restores Conidiation and Rhythmic Growth of the gpdhΔ Strain on PDA Plates—Although mycelia of the gpdhΔ strain were able to propagate on PDA plates, there were two noticeable growth and developmental defects: they failed to conidiate (Fig. 6A), and the growth was ar"
https://openalex.org/W2143147838,"The severity of allergic asthma is dependent, in part, on the intensity of peribronchial inflammation. P-selectin is known to play a role in the development of allergen-induced peribronchial inflammation and airway hyperreactivity. Selective inhibitors of P-selectin-mediated leukocyte endothelial-cell interactions may therefore attenuate the inflammatory processes associated with allergic airway disease. Novel P-selectin inhibitors were created using a polyvalent polymer nanoparticle capable of displaying multiple synthetic, low molecular weight ligands. By assembling a particle that presents an array of groups, which as monomers interact with only low affinity, we created a construct that binds extremely efficiently to P-selectin. The ligands acted as mimetics of the key binding elements responsible for the high-avidity adhesion of P-selectin to the physiologic ligand, PSGL-1. The inhibitors were initially evaluated using an in vitro shear assay system in which interactions between circulating cells and P-selectin-coated capillary tubes were measured. The nanoparticles were shown to preferentially bind to selectins expressed on activated endothelial cells. We subsequently demonstrated that nanoparticles displaying P-selectin blocking arrays were functionally active in vivo, significantly reducing allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity and peribronchial eosinophilic inflammation in a murine model of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2009361993,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is known to inhibit renin gene expression in juxtaglomerular cells, which are the main source of renin in vivo. In the present study we aimed to characterize the intracellular mechanisms of TNFα signaling to renin gene in the mouse juxtaglomerular cell line As4.1. TNFα was found to activate NFκB, which is one of the principal intracellular mediators of TNFα signal transduction. Constitutive activation of NFκB suppressed renin gene transcription, but NFκB appeared not to target the NFκB binding sites in the renin promoter. Thus, NFκB, but not the canonical NFκB binding sequences in the renin promoter, seemed to be involved in the suppression of renin transcription by TNFα. Deletion/mutation analysis revealed that the effect of TNFα on renin gene is transmitted by a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) located at -2697 to -2690. Mobility shift/supershift assays evidenced for the presence of NFκB proteins in the complex that binds to mouse renin CRE. Our results strongly suggest that NFκB mediates the effect of TNFα on renin transcription targeting a CRE in the mouse renin promoter.

Renin, synthesized in the JG cells of the kidney, is the limiting factor that determines the activity of plasma RAAS (1.Hackenthal E. Paul M. Ganten D. Taugner R. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1067-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Therefore renin production is under the strict control of multiple input signals. These could be divided into systematic factors including sodium load, blood pressure, sympathetic tone, plasma concentration of catecholamines and ATII, and local factors including the macula densa signal, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, endothelins, and cytokines (2.Wagner C.

Med. 2000; 78: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the regulatory sequences driving the developmental tissue and cell-specific expression of renin gene have been investigated intensively. However, the intracellular signaling cascades that are utilized by (patho)physiological extracellular factors to regulate the expression of renin gene are still not well understood. It is established that protein kinase A is involved in the stimulation of renin synthesis. Activated protein kinase A phosphorylates CREB/ATF transcription factors that target a cis-acting CRE to trigger renin transcription. Functional CREs were identified in the promoters of human and mouse renin genes (8.Ying L. Morris B.J. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2412-2420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9.Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q. Jones C.A. Petrovic N. Loudon J. Kane C. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol.

Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, there is still relative deficient knowledge about the intracellular signaling and the corresponding cis-regulatory elements, which confer inhibitory signals to renin gene. It is reported that ATII, which is one of the major humoral regulators of renin production, targets the proximal 2.8 kb of the mouse renin promoter to inhibit renin transcription in a protein kinase C-dependent manner (11.Müller M.W.H. Todorov V. Krämer B.K. Kurtz A. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

The orphan nuclear receptor Ear2 was identified (13.Liu X. Huang X. Sigmund C.D. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as a negative regulator of retinoid-induced renin promoter activity also in As4.1 cells. Recently (14.Fuchs S. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. J. Hypertens. 2003; 21: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a calcium-dependent inhibition of renin gene via negative calcium response element in human renin promoter was described. We have reported that TNFα is a physiologically relevant inhibitor of renin gene transcription (15.Todorov V. Müller M. Schweda F. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R1046-R1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The effect of TNFα on renin synthesis seems to be of fundamental importance in the regulation of blood pressure, because enhanced production of TNFα is part of the response of the organism to hypertension (16.Kapadia S.R. Oral H. Lee J. Nakano M. Taffet G.E. Mann D.L. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17.Dorffel Y. Latsch C. Stuhmüller B. Schreiber S. Scholze S. Burmester G.R. Scholze J. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, TNFα might be one humoral mediator of the long negative feedback loop of RAAS, linking the changes in blood pressure to the control of renin production. Moreover, TNF receptor type II (TNF-RII) locus is associated with essential hypertension (18.Glenn C.L. Wang W.Y.S. Benjafield A.V. Morris B.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and we found that TNF-RII, but not TNF-RI, is the predominant TNF receptor type expressed in the JG cells (15.Todorov V. Müller M. Schweda F. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R1046-R1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As 80% of the patients with essential hypertension have elevated plasma levels of renin it could be speculated that a malfunction of the TNFα signaling in the renin producing JG of the kidney is one of the key events in the etiology and/or pathogenesis of essential hypertension. This hypothesis is supported by data showing that TNFα signaling is impaired in spontaneously hypertensive rats (19.Johns D.G. Webb R.C. Charpie J.R. J. Hypertens. 2001; 19: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, to date the mechanism of action of TNFα on renin transcription in JG cells is almost unknown. Recently (15.Todorov V. Müller M. Schweda F. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R1046-R1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we could delimit the target region of TNFα to the proximal 4.2 kb of the mouse renin promoter. The present work aimed to study the signal transduction of TNFα to renin gene in the mouse As4.1 cells. The As4.1 cell line is presently the only clonal cell line of renal origin featured by an endogenous production of renin and thus very similar to the native renin-producing JG cells (20.Sigmund C.D. Okuyama K. Ingelfinger J. Jones C.A. Mullins J.J. Kane C. Kim U. Wu C.Z. Kenny L. Rustum Y. Dzau V.J. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19916-19922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The As4.1 cells are a reliable and well recognized model for studying the regulation of renin transcription (9.Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q. Jones C.A. Petrovic N. Loudon J. Kane C. Sigmund C.D.

Our results show that NFκB is the crucial intracellular mediator of the TNFα signaling to renin gene. We found that NFκB does not target its consensus binding sequences in the mouse renin promoter, but a cAMP-responsive element. Cell Culture—As4.1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-2193). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Biochrom KG) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. TNFα (10 ng/ml; Calbiochem) was applied 20 h before cell harvesting, unless otherwise specified. NFκB Activation Assay—Transcriptional activation of NFκB was measured by transcription factor ELISA. This method determines the binding activity of transcription factors, which gives an indirect estimation of their transcriptional potential. NFκB binding activity was quantified using Trans-AM™ NFκB-p50/NFκB-p65 kits (Active Motif) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, 3 × 106 As4.1 cells were collected in 100 μl of lysis buffer. After titration, 20 μl were used in the p50 binding assay, and 5 μl were used in the p65 binding assay (at concentration ∼2 μg/μl). The samples (two per condition, in duplicate) were shaken for 1 h at room temperature in 30 μl of binding buffer. After washing, anti-p50 or -p65 antibody diluted 1:1000 was applied to the wells for 1 h at room temperature. Specific binding was estimated by spectrophotometry after incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1 h at room temperature, 1:1000 diluted) at 450-nm wavelength. For competition analysis a 10-fold molar excess of double-stranded oligonucleotide was added. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear protein extracts were obtained according to the protocol of Schreiber et al. (22.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Aliquots were stored frozen at -80 °C. Complementary oligonucleotides in equimolar amounts were hybridized for 5 min at 95 °C and then were allowed to cool to room temperature. The probes were made from double-stranded oligonucleotides containing 5′-AATT overhangs at both sides, which were filled using Klenow polymerase with [α-32P]dATP or [α-33P]dATP and three other cold nucleotides. The renCRE (m30) probe sequence was 5′-GTTCCTTCTGTAATCCTCCCAATGACATCA-3′, which corresponds to bases -2719 to -2690 of the mouse renin promoter (GenBank™ accession number L78789; the CRE is underlined). The renCREmut (m30mut) probe, 5′-GTTCCTTCTGTAATCCTCCCAAccgttctg-3′, had mutated CRE (changed bases are lowercase). Typically 5 μg of nuclear extract was subjected to bandshift analysis. The binding reaction was performed for 15 min on ice in 1× gel shift binding buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05 g/liter poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) containing 40,000 cpm labeled probe in 10 μl total volume. For competition assays unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in 100-fold molar excess (unless otherwise specified) was preincubated with the nuclear extracts for 15 min before the addition of the probe. Supershift analysis was performed by adding 3-5 μl from the indicated antibody to the reactions followed by incubation on ice for 1 h after the addition of the labeled probe. Anti-p50 and -p65 antibodies were from Active Motif, whereas anti-cRel and -p52 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The binding reactions were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer at 4 °C. Plasmids—The 4.2- and the 2.8-kb mouse renin promoter-firefly luciferase constructs were already described (11.Müller M.W.H. Todorov V. Krämer B.K. Kurtz A. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15.Todorov V. Müller M. Schweda F. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R1046-R1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The deletion constructs 2.8kbΔ2866-2625, 2.8kbΔ2866-2689, 2.8kbΔ2866-2797, 2.8kbΔ2797-2767, and 2.8kbΔ2797-2719 were obtained from the 2.8-kb renin promoter (see Fig. 6A) as described previously (10.Klar J. Sandner P. Müller M.W. Kurtz A. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In brief, the flanking sequences of the regions aimed to be deleted were mutated using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit; Stratagene) to SacII restriction sites. The mutated plasmids were digested with SacII and relegated to generate the desired deletion constructs. The region from -2719 to -2690 bp in the 4.2-kb fragment was mutated (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) to generate new renin promoter-luciferase constructs as follows (changed bases are in bold, and CRE is underlined): 4.2 kb, GTTCCTTCTGTAATCCTCCCAATGACATCA; 4.2 kb-μ1, CCCTCGGGTGTAATCCTCCCAATGACATCA; 4.2 kb-μ2, GTTCCTTCTCCCCTCCTCCCAATGACATCA; 4.2 kb-μ3, GTTCCTTCTGTAAGAAGACCAATGACATCA; 4.2 kb-μ4, GTTCCTTCTGTAATCCTCTTGGTGACATCA; 4.2 kb-μ5, GTTCCTTCTGTAATCCTCCCAACCGTATCA; 4.2 kb-μ6, GTTCCTTCTGTAATCCTCCCAATGACTCTG; 4.2 kb-CRE, GTTCCTTCTGTAATCCTCCCAATGACGTCA; 4.2 kb-NFκB, GTTCCTTCTGTAATCCTCCCAAGGGACTTTCC. The four identified NFκB binding sequences in the 4.2-kb renin promoter fragment were mutated using site-directed mutagenesis as shown in Fig. 3A to generate 4.2 kb of 4× NFκB Mut firefly luciferase construct. pRL-SV40-Renilla luciferase vector (used as internal control for the efficiency of transfection) was from Promega. The pCRE-Luc vector (Clontech) contains firefly luciferase reporter under the control of multiple CRE sequences, whereas in the pNFκB-Luc vector (Clontech) the firefly luciferase was driven by four NFκB binding sequences. RNA Interference—Ready-to-use double-stranded 21-nucleotide RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized by IBA (Germany). The siRNA targeting IκBα (GenBank™ accession number NM_010907) corresponded to positions 111-131 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon; siRNA targeting CBP (GenBank™ accession number S66385) corresponded to positions 79-99 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. Single-stranded sense RNAs (used as control) or siRNAs (200 nm), together with 0.5 μg of the indicated firefly luciferase vector (Luc1) and 0.005 μg of Renilla luciferase vector (Luc2), were transfected into As4.1 cells with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. Transient Transfection—Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) essentially as described (15.Todorov V. Müller M. Schweda F. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R1046-R1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 0.5 μg of the indicated firefly luciferase vector (Luc1) were co-transfected with 0.005 μg of a plasmid containing an SV40 promoter driving Renilla luciferase (Luc2). RNA Isolation—Total RNA cells was isolated from As4.1 using Qiagen RNeasy Spin Columns. Reverse Transcription-Quantitative LightCycler PCR—Reverse transcription was performed as described (15.Todorov V. Müller M. Schweda F. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R1046-R1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). cDNAs were amplified on a Roche Applied Science LightCycler using the Fast Start SYBR Green I Kit from Roche Applied Science. The primers for renin and β-actin are described elsewhere (23.Jensen B.L. Schmid C. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F659-F669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used for the amplification of IκBα and CBP are available upon request. Luciferase Assay—Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Assay Kit from Promega, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative luciferase activity was calculated as firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase ratio (Luc1/Luc2). Immunoblotting—Total protein was extracted from As4.1 cells, and Western blotting was performed as described (21.Todorov V. Müller M. Kurtz A. Kidney Blood Press. Res. 2001; 24: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Anti-IκBα antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Immunofluorescence—As4.1 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in methanol. Anti-IκBα or anti-CBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was applied at 1:200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (dilution 1:100) and 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 45 min at room temperature. Statistics—All experiments were carried out in triplicate with three samples per condition unless otherwise indicated. Levels of significance were estimated by analysis of variance, followed by Student's unpaired t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. TNFα Activates NFκB in As4.1 Cells—Transcription factor NFκB is the classical intracellular mediator of TNFα action. NFκB is activated upon release from its cytoplasm inhibitors IκB-α, -β, -ϵ, Bcl-3, p100, and p105 (24.Baldwin Jr, A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar, 25.Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). IκBα is the prototypical NFκB inhibitor protein. Upon stimulation it is phosphorylated on Ser-32 and Ser-36 and thus is targeted to ubiquitin-dependent degradation (26.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). We used Western blot to assess the abundance of IκBα. It was considerably decreased after 16 h of incubation with TNFα, which is the earliest time point at which TNFα produces a marked decrease in renin mRNA (15.Todorov V. Müller M. Schweda F. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R1046-R1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Thus, NFκB signaling was proved to be functional in As4.1 cells upon prolonged incubation with TNFα. NFκB is a dimeric complex consisting of the Rel-like proteins RelA (p65), RelB, cRel, p50, and p52 (24.Baldwin Jr, A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar, 26.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). We used transcription factor ELISA (DNA binding assay) to study the TNFα-mediated activation of p50 and p65, which is the canonical inducible NFκB binding activity (27.Dobrzanski P. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28.Weih F. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3289-3297PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα increased p50 and p65 activity up to 4-fold (Fig. 1B). While p65 activity displayed two peaks 30 min and 8 h after TNFα application, p50 activity increased within the course of treatment (Fig. 1C). NFκB Does Not Target the NFκB Binding Sequences in the Mouse Renin Promoter to Suppress Renin Transcription—TNFα was found to suppress renin promoter activity (15.Todorov V. Müller M. Schweda F. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R1046-R1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and at the same time it activates NFκB in As4.1 cells (Fig. 1). Therefore, we checked whether NFκB is principally involved in the mechanism of suppression of renin transcription by TNFα. Constitutive activation of NFκB via RNA interference-mediated knock-down of the central NFκB inhibitory protein IκBα (Fig. 2, A and B) decreased drastically renin mRNA abundance and renin 4.2-kb fragment promoter activity in As4.1 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Next, we examined the 4.2-kb proximal promoter of the mouse renin gene (GenBank™ accession number L78789) for putative NFκB binding sites with MatSearch Professional (29.Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Four possible NFκB binding sequences were identified (Fig. 3A). DNA binding assays proved that these sequences bind NFκB p50 and p65 and that after mutations these sequences do not compete the binding of p50 or p65 to a consensus NFκB binding sequence (Fig. 3, B and C). To examine the functional significance of the identified NFκB binding sites, mutations were generated in the four NFκB renin promoter sequences (Fig. 3A), changing the critical bases conferring the cis-activation, to generate a 4.2-kb 4× NFκB Mut renin promoter construct. Transient transfections of the 4.2-kb 4× NFκB Mut in As4.1 cells revealed no change in the inhibition by TNFα, suggesting that NFκB does not target the four identified NFκB binding sites in the 4.2-kb renin promoter (Fig. 4). On the other hand when IκBα was knocked down, TNFα had no effect on the 4.2-kb 4× NFκB Mut construct suggesting that activated NFκB, but not renin promoter NFκB binding sequences, are necessary for the effect of TNFα (Fig. 5).Fig. 4Mutation of the NFκB binding sites in the 4.2-kb mouse renin promoter does not change the effect of TNFα As4.1 cells were transiently transfected with the proximal 4.2 kb of the mouse renin promoter containing the wild-type (4.2 kb) or the mutated (4.2 kb 4× NFκB Mut) NFκB binding sites.

Data are means ± S.E.; *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TNFα Targets a CRE in the Mouse Renin Promoter—Next we look for the regulatory sequence in the mouse renin gene that transmits the effect of TNFα. We performed a series of pilot deletion analyses of the 4.2-kb mouse renin promoter with constructs that were already used for the identification of the target sequence for cAMP (Fig. 6A) (10.Klar J. Sandner P. Müller M.W. Kurtz A. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). First we could delimit the target region of TNFα to the proximal 2.8 kb of the renin promoter (Fig. 6B). An enhancer element (located at -2866 to -2625 relative to transcription starting site) flanks the 5′-end of the 2.8-kb fragment (30.Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Deletions of different portions of the enhancer indicated that a sequence between -2797 and -2689 is targeted by TNFα (Fig. 6B). Further fractional deletions in the region from -2797 to -2689 lead to the identification of 30 bp (m30), in position -2917 to -2689, which were absolutely necessary for the inhibition of renin promoter activity by TNFα (Fig. 6B). The 30-bp sequence is featured by a TTCC motif at -2718 to -2715 and a CRE at -2697 to -2690 (9.Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q. Jones C.A. Petrovic N. Loudon J. Kane C. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45530-45538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10.Klar J. Sandner P. Müller M.W. Kurtz A. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). TTCC is the 3′-flank of the consensus NFκB binding site. This is also the core sequence for NFκB-p65 and -cRel, unlike NFκB-p50, which interacts preferentially with the 5′-flank of the NFκB consensus sequence (31.Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRE is the DNA target for the CREB/ATF transcription factors (32.Ziff E.B. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 69-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33.Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequential mutations were introduced in the m30 sequence, and the effect of TNFα was tested on the mutated constructs (4.2 kb-μ1-μ6; see “Materials and Methods”). The activity of constructs 4.2 kb-μ1 to -μ4, which contained mutations in positions from -2719 to -2698, was clearly decreased upon application of TNFα (Fig. 6C). These results suggested that the TTCC sequence at -2718 to -2715 is not targeted by TNFα. The effect of TNFα on construct 4.2 kb-μ5 was abrogated and on construct 4.2 kb-μ6, significantly attenuated (Fig. 6C). Notably, the core sequence of CRE is mutated in renin promoter construct 4.2 kb-μ5, and the 3′-half of CRE is mutated in renin promoter construct 4.2 kb-μ6. Moreover, the activity of 4.2 kb-μ5 was not influenced by constitutive activation of NFκB (Fig. 6D). Mouse renin CRE (TGACaTCA) differs from the consensus CRE sequence (TGACgTCA) by a single nucleotide (shown in lowercase). Therefore, we checked whether TNFα would have an effect on a 4.2-kb fragment in which renin CRE was mutated to consensus CRE sequence (plasmid 4.2 kb-CRE). The activity of 4.2 kb and 4.2 kb-CRE renin promoter constructs was similarly down-regulated by TNFα (Fig. 6E). Hence, it seems that the action of TNFα should be attributed generally to CRE rather than especially to the alternative form of CRE, which is present in the mouse renin promoter. We mutated mouse renin CRE also to a consensus NFκB binding site (GGGACTTTCC; plasmid 4.2 kb-NFκB). Unlike the constructs carrying a CRE sequence (4.2 kb and 4.2 kb-CRE) and similarly to the constructs carrying a mutated CRE sequence (4.2 kb-μ5 and 4.2 kb-μ6), the activity of the 4.2 kb-NFκB construct was almost unaffected by TNFα (Fig. 6E). We studied the effect of TNFα also on luciferase reporters driven by synthetic CRE or NFκB binding sequences. Thus, the activity of both 4.2-kb and CRE-luciferase constructs decreased about 2-fold after 8 h and was ∼3-fold suppressed after 20 h of treatment with TNFα (Fig. 7A). In contrast, the NFκB-luciferase was more than 4-fold up-regulated after 8 h and just 1.5-fold-stimulated after 20 h of incubation with TNFα (Fig. 7B), following the time course pattern of p65, which substantially determines the transcriptional activation of NFκB (compare Fig. 7B and Fig. 1C, right panel). CBP Is Not Involved in the Mechanism of Suppression of Renin Transcription by TNFα—NFκB and the CREB/ATF transcription factors, which are the consensus CRE-binding proteins, may compete for the transcriptional co-activator CBP. Therefore we knocked down CBP using RNA interference (Fig. 8,"
https://openalex.org/W2127921520,"We have used Affymetrix gene chip technology to look for changes in gene expression caused by a 24 h exposure of rat primary neonatal cardiac myocytes to the cardioprotective agent urocortin. We observed a 2.5-fold down-regulation at both the mRNA and protein levels of a specific calcium-insensitive phospholipase A2 enzyme. Levels of lysophosphatidylcholine, a toxic metabolite of phospholipase A2, were lowered by 30% in myocytes treated with urocortin for 24 h and by 50% with the irreversible iPLA2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone compared with controls. Both 4 h ischemia and ischemia followed by 24 h reperfusion caused a significant increase in lysophosphatidylcholine concentration compared with controls. When these myocytes were pretreated with urocortin, the ischemia-induced increase in lysophosphatidylcholine concentration was significantly lowered. Moreover, co-incubation of cardiac myocytes with urocortin, or the specific phospholipase A2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone, reduces the cytotoxicity produced by lysophosphatidylcholine or ischemia/reperfusion. Similarly, in the intact heart ex vivo we found that cardiac damage measured by infarct size was significantly increased when lysophoshatidylcholine was applied during ischemia, compared with ischemia alone, and that pre-treatment with both urocortin and bromoenol lactone reversed the increase in infarct size. This, to our knowledge, is the first study linking the cardioprotective effect of urocortin to a decrease in a specific enzyme protein and a subsequent decrease in the concentration of its cardiotoxic metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W2147591172,"Expression of stem cell factor SCF, a major mast cell growth factor, is potentiated shortly after co-treatment with interleukin (IL)-1beta and glucocorticoids. SCF promoter contains a GRE-like sequence and a putative kappaB site. We assessed the mechanisms of the regulation of SCF transcription in human lung fibroblasts in culture. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that co-treatment with IL-1beta and the glucocorticoid budesonide increased the SCF promoter occupancy by NF-kappaB and GR, as compared with IL-1beta and budesonide alone. In reporter gene assays, IL-1beta time-dependently increased the promoter activity, which was abolished by either pre-treatment with the MAP kinase inhibitors PD98059 (MEK) and SB203580 (p38), pre-treatment with the NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC, or deletion of the kappaB site. Budesonide time-dependently decreased the promoter activity, an effect requiring the GRE-like element. Co-treatment with IL-1beta and budesonide potentiated the promoter activity at 30 min, an effect blocked by PD98059 and SB203580, PDTC, or deletion of the kappaB or GRE-like element. In conclusion, the GRE-like sequence mediating the repression of SCF expression, thus acting as a negative-responsive element, is turned into a positive element in an NF-kappaB site-dependent manner, indicating a concerted action of these two regulatory elements in the potentiation of SCF gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2074196811,"Extracellular pH regulates glycine receptors through an unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that acidic pH remarkably inhibited glycine-activated whole-cell currents in recombinant glycine α1 and α1β receptors transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The proton effect was voltage-independent and pharmacologically competed with glycine receptor agonist glycine and antagonist strychnine. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified an N-terminal domain that is essential for proton-induced inhibition of glycine current. In α1 homomers, removal of the hydroxyl group by mutation of residue Thr-112 to Ala or Phe abolished inhibition of glycine currents by acidification. In contrast, mutation of Thr-112 to another hydroxylated residue (Tyr) produced receptors that retained partial proton sensitivity. In α1β heteromers, a single mutation of the β subunit T135A, which is homologous to α1 Thr-112, reduced proton sensitivity, whereas the double mutation α1(T112A)β(T135A) almost completely eliminated the proton sensitivity. In addition, the mutation α1 H109A greatly reduced sensitivity to protons in homomeric α1 receptors. The results demonstrate that extracellular pH can regulate the function of glycine α1 and α1β receptors.

An extracellular domain consisting of Thr-112 and His-109 at the α1 subunit and Thr-135 at the β subunit plays a critical role in determining proton modulation of glycine receptor function. Glycine is a fast inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. It acts by binding to Cl– conducting glycine receptors that belong to a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels including nicotinic acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid type A, and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptors. Glycine receptors are pentameric membrane proteins composed of α1–4 and β subunits. Only the α subunits can form functional homomeric receptors that contain major determinants of agonist and antagonist binding. Homomeric glycine receptors (primarily α2) appear to be expressed during embryonic and early postnatal development and might serve as extrasynaptic receptors throughout maturity (1.Flint A.C.

Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 2608-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Adult postsynaptic glycine receptors are composed of α1–4 and β subunits that form functional heteromeric receptors (3α:2β) and are located in spinal cord, brainstem, and many regions in brain (hippocampus, amygdala, striatum, cortex, etc.) (3.Legendre P.

Each subunit consists of a large extracellular N-terminal region, four transmembrane domains, and a large cytoplasmic domain. Transmembrane domain II forms the channel lumen (5.Langosch D. Thomas L.

Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 396-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and more sustained acidosis (up to a 1-unit drop in pH) after various patho-physiological conditions such as seizure, ischemia, and stroke (13.von Hanwehr R.

It is well known that protons modulate neuronal excitability, and this effect is partially mediated through pH modulation of activity of ion channels. Previous studies have shown that extracellular acidification decreases the opening of voltage-gated (Na+, K+, and Ca2+) (15.Daumas P. Andersen O.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 27-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16.Tombaugh G.C. Somjen G.G. J.

Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The pH modulation of glycine receptors has been only preliminarily assessed (22.Harvey R. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have characterized the sensitivity of homomeric α1 and heteromeric α1β receptors to extracellular pH and performed site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the structure-function relationship of glycine receptors in pH sensing. We have identified three residues at N terminus, Thr-112 and His-109 of the α1 subunit and Thr-135 of the β subunit, which play a critical role in determining proton modulation of glycine receptor function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloned Receptors—Wild type human glycine α1 and β cDNA were generous gifts from H. Betz. The wild type or mutant receptor cDNA was expressed in human embryonic kidney cell lines via the mammalian expression vector pCIS2. Cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation technique to achieve transient expression. Briefly, human embryonic kidney cells were plated onto coverslips and transfected with wild type or mutant subunits. Typically, α1 or α1 plus β (1:10) cDNA (24.Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz. H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) was added to cells growing exponentially on one coverslip placed in a 35-mm culture dish. After 6–8 h, cells were washed and placed in fresh culture medium. Transfected cells were used for electrophysiological analysis 24–48 h after the transfection.Mutagenesis—Mutations of receptor cDNA were performed using commercially available QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with commercially produced mutagenic primers (Integrated DNA Technologies). All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing (Biotechnology Core Facility, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX).Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch recordings were made at room temperature (22–25 °C). Patch pipettes of borosilicate glass (1B150F, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) were pulled (Flaming/Brown, P-87/PC, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) to a tip resistance of 1–2.5 megaohms. The pipette solution contained 140 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm MgATP, pH 7.2. Coverslips containing cultured cells were placed in a small chamber (∼1.5 ml) on the stage of an inverted light microscope (Olympus IMT-2) and superfused continuously (5–8 ml/min) with the following external solution containing 125 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 3.0 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm d-glucose, pH 7.3. Glycine-induced Cl– currents from the whole-cell patch clamp technique were obtained using an Axoclamp 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) equipped with a CV-4 head-stage. Glycine-induced Cl– currents were low pass-filtered at 5 kHz, monitored on an oscilloscope and a chart recorder (Gould TA240), and stored on a computer (pClamp 6.0, Axon Instruments) for subsequent analysis. 60–80% series resistance compensation was applied at the amplifier. To monitor the possibility that access resistance changed over time or during different experimental conditions, at the initiation of each recording we measured and stored on our digital oscilloscope the current response to a 5-mV voltage pulse. This stored trace was continually referenced throughout the recording. If a change in access resistance was observed during the recording period, the patch was aborted, and the data were not included in the analysis. Except during acquisition of current-voltage (I-V) relationships, cells were voltage-clamped at –60 mV. I-V relationships were determined by subtracting responses to continuous voltage ramp (–50 to +50 mV in 0.5 s) before EC30 glycine concentration (15 μm for α1 and 10 μm for α1β) application from the responses to the same voltage protocols during glycine application.Heteromeric α1β glycine receptors are 17-fold less sensitive to picrotoxin than homomeric α1 receptors (25.Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, the incorporation of β subunits with α1 subunits was confirmed by assessing picrotoxin sensitivity. If 500 μm picrotoxin caused 30% or less inhibition of the current activated by EC30 glycine, it was assumed that heteromeric α1β receptors were expressed.Experimental Protocol—pH of external solutions was altered by the addition of NaOH or HCl and routinely checked before and during experiments. Glycine was prepared in the extracellular solution and applied from independent reservoirs by gravity flow for 10 s to cells using a Y-shaped tube positioned within 100 μm of the cells. With this system, the 10–90% rise time of the junction potential at the open tip was 12–51 ms (21.Huang R.Q. Dillon G.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Once a control glycine response was determined, the effect of pH on the response was examined. To assess the pH effect cells were first bathed in media that was set to the test pH, then glycine, dissolved in the same test pH solution, was applied to the cells. Because in the whole-cell recordings, external solution of low pH elicited, as in other studies (20.Zhai J. Peoples R.W. Li C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21.Huang R.Q. Dillon G.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23.Krishek B.J. Amato A. Connelly C.N. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a transient whole-cell inward current through acid-sensing ion channels, glycine application at various pH test values was made after the transient current had recovered and stabilized. Glycine applications were separated by at least 3-min intervals to ensure both adequate washout of glycine from the bath and recovery of receptors from desensitization if present.Chemicals—All drugs were obtained from Sigma. Glycine, strychnine, and ZnCl2 stocks were made in double distilled H2O.Data Analysis—Glycine concentration-response profiles were fitted to the following equation I/Imax = [glycine]n/(EC50n + [glycine]n), where I and Imax represent the normalized glycine-induced current at a given concentration and the maximum current induced by a saturating concentration of glycine, respectively, EC50 is 50% effective glycine concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient.Concentration-response curves for strychnine inhibitory effect were fitted to the following equation: I/Imax = [strychnine]n/([strychnine]n + IC50), where I is the Cl– current amplitude at the end of drug application normalized to control at a given strychnine concentration, IC50 is the half-blocking concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient. Concentration-response profiles were evaluated using approximately the EC30 glycine concentration. A minimum of three individual experiments was conducted for each paradigm. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. Student's t test (paired or unpaired) or a one-way analysis of variance was used to determine statistical significance (p < 0.05).RESULTSExtracellular Protons Inhibit Glycine-activated Currents— Based on the characterization of recombinant glycine receptors at the control condition pH 7.3, 15 and 10 μm glycine are approximately EC30 concentrations for α1 and α1β receptors, respectively (see Fig. 2, A and B). The EC30 concentrations generate a stable current, elicit minimal receptor desensitization, and allow -fold modulator-induced potentiation of the glycine-evoked response. In assessing the effect of pH on the EC30 glycine response, we varied the pH of the external medium between 8.4 and 5.4. The modulatory effect of glycine-activated current by extracellular pH in human glycine α1 and α1β receptors is illustrated in Fig. 1. The amplitude of current activated by EC30 glycine was increased when the pH was increased from 7.3 to 7.8 and 8.4 and markedly attenuated when pH was decreased from 7.3 to 6.8 and 6.4 (Fig. 1, A and B). The effect of pH on glycine current was rapid and completely reversible (Fig. 1, A and B). No adaptation to proton effect was observed during a prolonged perfusion (up to 10 min) with acidic or alkaline medium (data not shown). Fig. 1C shows the average sensitivity of glycine-activated current to protons over the range of pH 5.4–8.4. In both receptors the acidic pH had a more profound effect than alkaline pH on glycine current. For homomeric α1 receptors, the glycine current activated by 15 μm glycine was enhanced to 118 ± 4.8% at pH 7.8 and to 129 ± 10% of the control at pH 8.4 (n = 3–5). The response to 15 μm glycine was inhibited to 43 ± 6.6% at pH 6.8, 22 ± 3.4% at pH 6.4, and 12 ± 1.8% of the control at pH 5.4 (n = 3–4). For heteromeric α1β receptors, glycine-activated currents were also sensitive to acidic pH and hardly sensitive to alkaline pH. The current activated by 10 μm glycine was inhibited to 39.1 ± 5.4 and 1.3 ± 1.3% of the control at pH 6.4 and 5.4, respectively (n = 6). The effect of alkaline pH (pH 8.4) on glycine current, however, was minimal (107 ± 2.5% of the control) (Fig. 1C).Fig. 1Effect of protons on glycine-activated current recorded in recombinant human glycine α1 and α1β receptors. A and B, typical recording of responses of glycine α1 (A) and α1β receptors (B) to glycine over a pH range from 6.4 to 8.4. Successive traces demonstrate currents activated by EC30 glycine concentration (15 μm for α1 and 10 μm for α1β) were remarkably inhibited by acidic pH and potentiated by alkaline pH. Note that the pH effects were reversible and dependent on the concentration of protons. C, summary of relative current activated by EC30 glycine plotted as a function of pH. Glycine currents over the range of pH from 8.4 to 5.4 were normalized to the current recorded at control condition (pH 7.3, assigned as 100%, overlaps for α1 and α1β). Data plotted are the means ± S.E. Each data point is the average of at least 3 cells at a holding potential of –60 mV. The curve shown is the best fit of the data to the logistic equation, which yielded a transition point of pH 7.0 and 6.5 for α1 and α1β receptor, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Glycine Currents by Protons Is Pharmacologically Competitive—Protons might inhibit glycine-activated current by decreasing the affinity of the receptors for glycine or decreasing the efficacy of glycine at receptors or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, concentration-response curves for glycine-activated current were determined at pH 7.3, 8.4, and 6.4 for α1 and α1β receptors. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, change in pH shifted the glycine EC50 values for both receptor configurations. For α1 homomers, EC50 values were 53.7, 23.0, and 19.1 μm at pH 6.4, 7.3, and 8.4, respectively. The EC50 value at pH 6.4 was increased significantly compared with pH 7.3 (p < 0.05, n = 4, paired t test, Fig. 2A). For α1β heteromers, the EC50 values were 32, 18, and 19 μm at 6.4, 7.3, and 8.4, respectively. The EC50 value at pH 6.4 was significantly different from that at pH 7.3 (p < 0.05, paired t test, n = 6, Fig. 2B). In contrast, the maximal glycine-activated current and Hill coefficient values were not significantly affected by changes in pH in either receptor (p > 0.05). The lack of shift in EC50 at pH 8.4 is comparable with minimal effect of alkaline pH on the glycine receptors (Fig. 1).Proton Inhibitory Effect Is Voltage-independent—To evaluate whether protons inhibit the glycine response by altering the Cl– ion driving force, the effect of protons on the reversal potential of glycine-activated current was examined. Fig. 2, C and D, shows the current-voltage relationship for current activated by EC30 glycine at pH 7.3 and 6.4 for α1 and α1β receptors recorded from the same cell. The glycine-induced currents reversed at the calculated equilibrium potential for Cl– ions (ECl = –3.14 mV). For α1 receptors the reversal potential was –4.9 ± 1.6 mV at pH 8.4, –6.9 ± 2.5 mV at pH 7.3, and –3.9 ± 1.8 mV at 6.4 (n = 4–6). These values are not significantly different (p > 0.05, one-way analysis of variance). In addition, the average percentage inhibition by protons (at pH 6.4) did not significantly differ at membrane holding potentials between –50 and +50 mV (71 ± 7.4% at –50 mV, 73 ± 11% at –30 mV, 63 ± 11% at +30 mV, 62 ± 12% at +50 mV, n = 4–6; p > 0.05, one-way analysis of variance). The proton effect on I-V relationship for α1β receptors was similar to that for α1 receptors (n = 3, Fig. 2D). Therefore, the data suggest that protons neither alter the ion permeance ratio of the channel nor act on a site influenced by the transmembrane electric field.Protons Attenuate Strychnine-induced Inhibition of Glycine Current—Proton sensitivity characterized above suggests that protons modulate homomeric and heteromeric glycine receptors in a qualitatively similar manner. The competitive inhibition of both glycine receptors by protons lured us to propose that protons may inhibit glycine receptors at ligand binding sites. Because α subunits contain binding sites for agonists and competitive antagonists (24.Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz. H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 25.Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we tested this hypothesis in homomeric α1 receptors. We examined the proton effect on the apparent affinity of strychnine, a competitive antagonist. Strychnine is a weak base with a pKa value of 8.26 (26.O'Neil M.J. Smith A. Heckelman P.E. The Merck index. 13 Ed. Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ2001: 8941Google Scholar). Based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, ∼90% of the strychnine molecules are estimated to remain in the zwitterionic form within the pH range from 6.4 to 7.3. As shown in Fig. 3A, a change of pH from 7.3 to 6.4 significantly shifted strychnine inhibition of currents activated by equal potency of glycine (EC30). IC50 for strychnine was increased from 43.9 ± 6.1 nm at pH 7.3 to 102 ± 32 nm at pH 6.4 (n = 6, p < 0.05, paired t test). The maximal inhibition of strychnine was not affected by the change in pH.Fig. 3Effect of protons (A) and mutations (B) on strychnine inhibition of glycine currents in glycine α1 receptors. The steady-state currents were normalized to the control current in the absence of strychnine at pH 7.3. Strychnine was coapplied for 10 s with equal potency of glycine (∼EC30). A, effect of protons on strychnine inhibition of glycine currents in glycine α1 wild type receptors. The IC50 and Hill coefficient values (in parentheses) for strychnine were: pH 7.3, 44 ± 6.1 nm (1.03 ± 1.0); pH 6.4, 102 ± 32 nm (0.79 ± 0.10). Note that acidic pH shifted strychnine curve to the right with an increasing IC50 for strychnine (p < 0.05, unpaired t test, n = 6). B, effect of strychnine on glycine-activated currents in wild type (WT), mutant α1(T112A), and α1(T112Y) receptors at pH 7.3. The response to strychnine at concentrations from 1 to 1000 nm was recorded in the presence of the respective glycine EC30. The data are normalized to the control current in the absence of strychnine. Each data point represents the mean value of at least four cells. The concentration-response curve from wild type receptors (dashed line) was taken from Fig. 3A. The IC50 values and Hill coefficients (in parentheses) for strychnine were: wild type, 44 ± 6.4 nm (1.04 ± 0.10); T121A, 120 ± 30 nm (1.26 ± 0.32); T112Y, 333 ± 78 nm (1.05 ± 0.16). IC50 values in mutants were significantly different from wild type (p < 0.05, unpaired t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutation α1 T112A Abolishes Protons Sensitivity—It has been reported that the Zn2+-induced inhibition of glycine current was greatly attenuated in acidic pH (22.Harvey R. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25.Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that Zn2+ may interact with protons at the same site(s). Previous studies indicate that the residues Thr-112 on the α1 subunits are critical to the inhibition by Zn2+ (25.Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27.Nevin S.T. Cromer B.A. Haddrill J.L. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28985-28992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Thr-112 is also important for inhibition by the competitive antagonist strychnine (34.Schmieden V. Kuhse J. Betz H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Inspection of the amino acid sequence for ligand-gated anionic channels revealed that Thr is conserved at the equivalent position across all the subunits among γ-aminobutyric acid type A, glycine, and γ-aminobutyric acid type C receptors (residues marked with an asterisk in Fig. 4). In addition, both Zn2+ and protons exert an inhibitory effect on these receptors (21.Huang R.Q. Dillon G.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22.Harvey R. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J.

Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2005-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Thr-112 residue is a candidate for proton action sites on glycine α1 receptors.Fig. 4Partial amino acid sequence alignment for acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), human γ-aminobutyric acid, type A subunits (hGABAA α1–6, β1–3, γ2), human (h-) ρ1-2, and glycine subunits (hGLY; α1–3 and β) at the N terminus. A threonine and a histidine residue (except in AChBP), indicated with asterisks, are conserved in all subunits. The solid dots indicate a aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E) residue on either side of threonine reside in glycine subunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the functional role of Thr-112 in modulation of glycine-activated currents, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to replace the threonine residue at 112 with alanine, which has similar residue volume to threonine but lacks a hydroxyl group (-OH). The mutation T112A did not cause a significant shift in glycine EC50 (from 23 ± 2.1 μm in wild type to 42 ± 5.6 μm (n = 4) in mutant receptors at pH 7.3, p > 0.05, unpaired t test), which is consistent with previous investigations (11.Han N.L. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 636-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34.Schmieden V. Kuhse J. Betz H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, mutation T112A greatly reduced the inhibition of glycine currents by strychnine at pH 7.3 compared with wild type receptors. Fig. 3B shows that receptors expressing T112A were about 3-fold less sensitive to strychnine (IC50 value of 120 ± 30 nm, n = 4) than the wild type (IC50 value of 44 ± 6.1 nm, n = 6, p < 0.05, unpaired t test). The Hill coefficient and maximal inhibition were not altered by the mutation. As shown in Fig. 5A, T112A completely abolished proton modulatory effect on glycine α1. The current activated by EC30 glycine (25 μm) was 111 ± 14.5% of the control at pH 5.4 and 90 ± 3.1% of the control at pH 8.4 for mutant receptors. This compares to 12 ± 1.8% at pH 5.4 and 129 ± 10% at pH 8.4 in wild type receptors (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, a shift of pH from 7.3 to 6.4 was unable to affect EC50 values for glycine or maximal available glycine-induced current for T112A mutant receptors (EC50 = 27.6 ± 3.8 μm at pH 7.3 and 28.7 ± 5.78 μm at pH 6.4, respectively, n = 5) compared with a right shift of concentration-response curve observed in wild type receptors (Fig. 2A). These data suggest Thr-112 is sufficient to account for the effect of protons on glycine α1 receptors.Fig. 5Proton effect on wild type and mutant glycine α1 receptors. A, typical recording of responses of the α1(T112A) receptors to 25 μm glycine (EC30) over a pH range of 5.4–8.4. Note that the mutation T112A causes a loss of sensitivity to protons. B, summarized data of proton sensitivity of wild type (WT) and mutant glycine α1 receptors. The data are normalized to the control current at pH 7.3 and represent the mean ±S.E. of at least 4 cells. The mutation T112A completely abolished proton sensitivity, whereas receptors expressing T112Y retained partial sensitivity to protons. α1(T112F) receptors lost proton sensitivity to pH 6.4 but remain sensitive to pH 5.4 (n = 5). C, proton effect on concentration-response relationship of the mutant α1(T112A) glycine receptors. The currents are normalized to the maximal response elicited by glycine at pH 7.3. Changes in pH did not affect glycine EC50 or Hill coefficient in α1(T112A) receptors. The EC50 values and Hill coefficients (in parentheses) were: 28 ± 3.8 μm (1.94 ± 0.38) at pH 7.3; 29 ± 5.8 μm (1.84 ± 0.28) at pH 6.4. Each data point represents the mean of five cells.

https://openalex.org/W2146391955,"Ribavirin is a broad spectrum antiviral nucleoside that displays activity against a variety of RNA and DNA viruses. Ribavirin is currently used in combination with interferon-α for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and was recently shown to be directly incorporated by the HCV RNA polymerase into RNA products. This capacity ultimately leads to increased mutation rates and drastically reduces the viral fitness. As a first step toward elucidating the nature of the specific interaction between ribavirin and the HCV polymerase, we have utilized fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor precisely the binding of ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) to the viral polymerase. This spectroscopic approach allowed us to clearly separate the RTP binding activity from the concomitant catalytic steps. We report here the first detailed study of the binding kinetics and thermodynamic parameters involved in the interaction between RTP and an RNA polymerase. We demonstrate that RTP binds to the same active site as nucleotides. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the HCV polymerase cannot only bind to RTP but also to nonphosphorylated ribavirin, albeit with less affinity. By using various combinations of template-primers, we also demonstrate that base pairing is not involved in the initial binding of RTP to the HCV polymerase. Based on the results of circular dichroism and denaturation studies, we show that the RNA polymerase undergoes subtle conformational changes upon the binding of RTP, although the interaction does not significantly modify the stability of the protein. Finally, although metal ions are required for catalytic activity, they are not required for the initial binding of RTP to the polymerase. Such quantitative analyses are of primary importance for the rational design of new ribavirin analogues of potential therapeutic value and provide crucial insights on the interaction between RTP and the HCV RNA polymerase."

Here the molecular bases for SMX high-affinity block are investigated. The polymorphism causes a benign T to A amino acid mutation at position 8 (T8A) that destroys an N-glycosylation site of MiRP1. In vitro disruption of glycosylation by mutagenesis or in vivo by treatment with neuraminidase is associated with increased susceptibility to SMX and to other elementary agents such as divalent cations. Defective glycosylation does not affect the ability of T8A to form stable complexes with HERG, but rather it increases drug susceptibility through structural modifications in the channel complex. We conclude that N-glycosylation may play a key role in the etiology of life-threatening arrhythmia."
https://openalex.org/W2162913086,"Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase is thought to be absent from organelles. Instead, Gln-tRNA is formed via the transamidation pathway, the other route to this essential compound in protein biosynthesis. However, it was previously shown that glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase activity is present in Leishmania mitochondria. This work identifies genes encoding glutaminyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetase in the closely related organism Trypanosoma brucei. Down-regulation of their respective gene products by RNA interference showed that (i) they are essential for the growth of insect stage T. brucei and (ii) they are responsible for essentially all of the glutaminyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetase activity detected in both the cytosol and the mitochondria. In vitro aminoacylation experiments with the recombinant T. brucei enzymes and total tRNA confirmed the identity of the two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Interestingly, T. brucei uses the same eukaryotic-type glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase to form mitochondrial and cytosolic Gln-tRNA. The formation of Glu-tRNA in mitochondria and the cytoplasm is catalyzed by a single eukaryotic-type discriminating glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. T. brucei, similar to Leishmania, imports all of its mitochondrial tRNAs from the cytosol. The use of these two eukaryotic-type enzymes in mitochondria may therefore reflect an adaptation to the situation in which the cytosol and mitochondria use the same set of tRNAs.

The use of these two eukaryotic-type enzymes in mitochondria may therefore reflect an adaptation to the situation in which the cytosol and mitochondria use the same set of tRNAs. For protein synthesis, most organisms require 20 functionally different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, one for each amino acid. These enzymes attach the cognate amino acid to the corresponding tRNA species, e.g. glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) 1The abbreviations used are: GlnRS, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase; GluRS, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase; RNAi, RNA interference; 2-ME, 2-mercaptoethanol; ORF, open reading frame; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. acylates tRNAGln with glutamine. However, in many organisms, the formation of Gln-tRNA does not proceed by direct aminoacylation. Rather, Gln-tRNA is synthesized in a tRNA-dependent amidation of glutamate mischarged to tRNAGln. Genomic and biochemical analyses indicate that the pathways of Gln-tRNA formation evolved as distinct systems in the three kingdoms (1.Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic cytoplasm uses GlnRS exclusively, whereas bacteria and archaea utilize the transamidation pathway. Because of the bacterial origin of organelles, the transamidation pathway is expected to be present in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Biochemical data have shown that most organelles lack GlnRS activity and instead use the indirect transamidation pathway to Gln-tRNA formation (2.Schön A. Krupp G. Gough S. Berry-Lowe S. Kannangara C.G. Söll D. Nature. 1986; 322: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Whereas in many eukaryotes all of the tRNAs necessary for organellar translation are encoded on the mitochondrial genome, there are a large variety of organisms in which a variable number of apparently essential mitochondrial tRNA genes are missing. It has been shown that the lack of these genes is generally compensated by import of the corresponding cytosolic tRNAs (3.Schneider A. Marechal-Drouard L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 509-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In all of the cases known, imported tRNAs originate from nuclear genes encoding eukaryotic-type tRNAs also utilized in cytosolic translation. An extreme situation is found in the trypanosomatids such as Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania, which have lost the entire set of mitochondrial tRNA genes. These organisms must import all of the tRNAs necessary for organellar protein synthesis. As a result, the bacterial-type translation system of the mitochondria is forced to function with imported eukaryotic-type tRNAs only (4.Schneider A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 557-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it was shown that a mitochondrial GlnRS activity exists in Leishmania (5.Nabholz C.E. Hauser R. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7903-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate this finding at the genome level, we decided to characterize Gln-tRNA and Glu-tRNA formation in T. brucei in which RNA interference methodology (6.Ngo I. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) and biochemical analysis could be used. Cells—Procyclic T. brucei, stock 427, was grown at 27 °C in semi-defined medium-79 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested at 3.5–4.5 × 107 cells/ml. Procyclic T. brucei, strain 29–13, on which the RNAi knock-down cell lines are based was grown in semi-defined medium-79 supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 15 μg/ml G418 (7.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Cultures were harvested at a density of 0.5–2 × 107 cells/ml. Identifying T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS—The T. brucei databases (tigrblast.tigr.org/er-blast/index.cgi?project=tba1 and www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_brucei/) were analyzed with the BLAST software using default parameter settings to search for putative trypanosomal GlnRS and GluRS genes using the corresponding cytosolic yeast enzymes (www.yeastgenome.org/; GluRS, ORF YGL245W; GlnRS, ORF YOR168W) as query sequences. Two ORFs showing 41 and 47% identity to the yeast GlnRS and GluRS, respectively, were found. As expected for eukaryotic-type GlnRS and GluRS, the trypanosomal proteins share a high degree of sequence similarity (54%). Besides the eukaryotic-type GlnRS and GluRS, no other ORFs showing any significant similarity to either eukaryotic or bacterial-type GlnRS or GluRS or to any putative Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase were found in the T. brucei genome. RNA Interference—The RNAi constructs for the GlnRS and GluRS knock-down experiments are based on the previously described (7.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) stem loop construct carrying convenient cloning sites and a spacer corresponding to 690 nucleotides of the trypanosomal spliced leader sequence. Fragments corresponding to the 5′ part of the coding region of the GlnRS ORF (28G16.175/region +33 to +619) or the GluRS ORF (43.m00224/region -4 to +476) were PCR-amplified and inserted into the corresponding sites of the modified stem loop vector. The resulting plasmids carrying one gene fragment each were then used to insert the same gene fragments in the opposite direction. The resulting RNAi plasmids were linearized with NotI and transfected into the procyclic T. brucei strain 29-13, which expresses T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor (7.Wang Z.

RNA. 2000; 6: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Selection with phleomycine, cloning, and induction with tetracycline were done as described previously (9.Beverley S.M. Clayton C.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 333-348PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Aminoacylation Using Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Extracts of T. brucei—RNA-free cytosolic fractions were prepared as follows. Washed T. brucei cells were hypotonically lysed at 1.2 × 109 cells/ml in 1 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8 by four passages through a 25-gauge syringe needle. A quarter volume of 5× acylation buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm KCl, 40 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and NaCl (final concentration 150 mm) was added. The extract was centrifuged for 25 min at 150,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated with 1× acylation buffer. The flow-through fractions corresponding to RNA-free cytosol were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -70 °C until further use in the charging assays. Mitochondrial fractions were prepared as follows: mitoplasts of T. brucei were hypotonically purified as described previously (10.Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resuspended in 50-μl aliquots at a concentration of ∼40 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 250 mm sucrose, and 2 mm EDTA, and frozen in liquid N2. The purity of the mitoplast fraction was tested by immunoblots using antibodies against the mitochondrial heat shock protein 60 and the cytosolic protein pyruvate kinase as described previously (5.Nabholz C.E. Hauser R. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7903-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For charging assays, the mitoplasts were thawed and centrifuged for 5 min at 8,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1× acylation buffer containing 1% CHAPS and spun for 5 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant fraction (5–20 μl) was used for the charging assays. No attempt was made to remove endogenous mitochondrial tRNAs, because very little charging was observed in the absence of added tRNAs. Aminoacylation was preformed as described previously (5.Nabholz C.E. Hauser R. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7903-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using the indicated amounts of protein fractions and ∼4 μg of isolated total trypanosomal tRNA each. Cloning of the T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS Genes and Expression of the Gene Product—Oligonucleotides were synthesized, and DNAs were sequenced by the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. The gene sequences of the T. brucei GlnRS (28G16.175) and GluRS (43.m00224) were found at the T. brucei GeneDB (www.genedb.org/genedb/tryp/index.jsp). The genes were cloned by PCR from T. brucei genomic DNA using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The cloning and subsequent expression of the full-length T. brucei GlnRS ORF yielded an insoluble protein; therefore, the predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence was removed (+1 to +129 in 28G16.175). An N-terminal His6 tag was introduced into the truncated T. brucei GlnRS by PCR, and cloning into a pET15b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) was achieved by adding a 5′-NcoI and 3′-NdeI restriction sites. Oligonucleotide primers introduced a 5′-NdeI site and a 3′-XhoI site into the full-length T. brucei GluRS ORF. A C-terminal His6 tag was added by cloning the gene into the pET20b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). All of the proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL strain (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which also expresses minor E. coli tRNA genes from a chloramphenicol-resistant vector. Cultures of E. coli transformed with either the T. brucei GlnRS or GluRS expression vectors were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of tryptone, and 10 g of NaCl, pH 7.0) with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.034 mg/ml chloramphenicol. At a cell density of A600 = 0.8, the temperature was reduced to 30 °C, ampicillin was refreshed to 0.1 mg/ml, and recombinant protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Upon induction, the LB medium was brought to 1% ethanol to reduce the formation of inclusion bodies. Growth was continued for 4 h post-induction, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. Enzyme Purification—The His6-tagged proteins were purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described previously (11.Tumbula-Hansen D. Feng L. Toogood H. Stetter K.O. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37184-37190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GlnRS was further purified using an ÄKTA-fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) by ion-exchange chromatography on Mono S HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences). The pure GlnRS fraction was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05 mm benzamidine-HCl, and stored at -80 °C. The GluRS was further purified on a 5-ml HiTrap heparin HP column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by gel filtration on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) and then prepared for storage as described above. The enzyme fractions appeared to be >95% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Protein concentrations were determined by the Quantigold (Diversified Biotech, Boston, MA) colloidal gold protein assay (12.Stoscheck C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Preparation of T. brucei tRNA—Total T. brucei RNA (3.95 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-ME and loaded onto a Qiagen-tip 100 column (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) pre-equilibrated with 20 ml of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 15% isopropyl alcohol, 1% Triton-X, and 5 mm 2-ME. After washing the column with 20 column volumes of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.2 m NaCl, and 5 mm 2-ME, the tRNA was eluted with 2 column volumes of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.75 m NaCl, 15% ethanol, and 5 mm 2-ME. Further deacylation of tRNA and collection of tRNA was performed as described previously (13.Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This preparation yielded 223 μg of unfractionated tRNA, which represented ∼6% of the total T. brucei RNA used as starting material. Purity of the tRNA was >95% as determined by denaturing 12% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel electrophoresis. Aminoacylation Assays—[14C]Gln (50 μCi/ml, 242 mCi/mmol) and [14C]Glu (50 μCi/ml, 254 mCi/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Assays were performed essentially as described previously (14.Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation reactions were performed at 37 °C in 100 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.2, 60 mm KCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm total T. brucei tRNA, and 50 μm [14C]Gln or [14C]Glu using 100 nm GlnRS or GluRS. The control reactions lacked tRNA or contained 60 μm of commercially available E. coli total tRNA (Roche Applied Science). Sample workup and scintillation counting were carried out as before (14.Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The identity of the amino acids attached to tRNAs was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (data not shown) (1.Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Analysis of the available T. brucei genome (www.genedb.org) by BLAST searches revealed the lack of the genes encoding the key enzyme of the transamidation pathway, Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase, whereas single genes encoding eukaryotictype GlnRS as well as a GluRS were detected. MITOPROT analysis predicted the presence of an N-terminal mitochondrial import signal for the T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS (probabilities are 0.96 [GlnRS] and 0.92 [GluRS]). This is not the case for other orthologous eukaryotic synthetases. Additional characteristics of the T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS are discussed below. Taken together, the genome search predicted that direct acylation should generate Gln-tRNA and that single GlnRS and GluRS enzymes should catalyze the formation of their cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria of T. brucei. To test these predictions, we wanted to know whether the GlnRS and GluRS homologues are essential for the survival of T. brucei and where in the cell the gene products are localized. Furthermore, it was important to confirm the predicted biochemical activities of the two proteins and to investigate whether they are responsible for all of the Gln-tRNA and Glu-tRNA formation in both intracellular compartments or whether independent redundant pathways may exist. To answer the questions outlined above, we made use of RNAi. This is the process in which the presence of a double-stranded RNA in a cell causes specific degradation of the corresponding mRNA. RNAi was shown to be a powerful method for the inhibition of gene expression in T. brucei (6.Ngo I. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 7.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 8.Shi H. Djikeng A. Mark T. Wirtz E. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA. 2000; 6: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15.Bochud-Allemann N. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32849-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is optimally suited for RNAi analysis because as a unicellular eukaryote T. brucei is not prone to the recently recognized problems of RNAi analysis in mammalian cells, which are caused by the activation of interferon-mediated processes (16.Bridge A.J. Pebernard S. Ducraux A. Nicoulaz A.L. Iggo R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 17.Sledz C.A. Holko M. de Veer M.J. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Therefore, unlike in mammalian cells, long double-stranded RNAs can be used to induce RNAi. We therefore established two transgenic T. brucei cell lines allowing tetracycline-inducible expression of double-stranded RNA corresponding to the 5′ regions of the putative GlnRS and GluRS genes, respectively. RNAi-induced Ablation of T. brucei GlnRS—The ablation of the GlnRS homologue in T. brucei results in a growth arrest ∼90 h after the addition of tetracycline (Fig. 1A). Therefore, as would be expected for a translation factor, the GlnRS homologue is essential for the survival of insect stage T. brucei. To measure the biochemical phenotype of the RNAi cell line, we isolated an RNA-free cytosolic fraction from untreated cells and from cells grown in the presence of tetracycline for 90 h. The cytosolic fractions were then tested for the presence of GlnRS and GluRS activities by in vitro aminoacylation assays using labeled glutamine or glutamate and tRNAs isolated from total cells as substrates (5.Nabholz C.E. Hauser R. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7903-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The results showed that the cytosolic fractions from both uninduced and induced cells in which the GlnRS was targeted still exhibit GluRS activity (Fig. 1B, left panel), although a slight reduction to ∼70% is observed in induced cells. The GlnRS activity in induced cells, however, drops to 15–30% of the one measured in the uninduced cytosol (Fig. 1B, right panel). Thus, these results show that the putative GlnRS gene encodes the trypanosomal enzyme responsible for most if not all of the cytosolic Gln-tRNA formation. How can the slight decline in GluRS activity in a cell line expected to be specifically down-regulated for the GlnRS activity be explained? We think that this might be due to the fact that although down-regulation of the GlnRS activity is the primary phenotype of the cell line, the resulting arrest of protein synthesis will nonspecifically affect many other physiological processes. This explanation is supported by the fact that concomitant with the drop of GluRS activity a reduction of methionyl-tRNA synthetase activity to 80% of the one found in uninduced cells was observed (data not shown). The low level of GlnRS activity that persists in the induced RNAi cell lines is not unexpected, because RNAi is known to greatly reduce the targeted mRNAs but generally does not eliminate them completely. The extent of the down-regulation depends on many factors and appears to be gene-specific (15.Bochud-Allemann N. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32849-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Trypanosomal GlnRS is predicted to contain an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, which raises the question whether it also functions in mitochondria. To investigate this possibility, we isolated mitochondria from uninduced and induced (90 h) cells. The mitochondrial preparations were then used for in vitro charging assays. The results (Fig. 1C) are essentially identical to the ones obtained with the cytosol and demonstrate that in T. brucei the same gene encodes both cytosolic and mitochondrial GlnRS. Furthermore, because essentially all of the GlnRS activity was abolished in mitochondria of induced cells, these results also show that direct acylation by GlnRS is the major and probably the only pathway for the formation of mitochondrial glutaminyl-tRNA. RNAi-induced Ablation of T. brucei GluRS—The results for the RNAi cell line ablated for the trypanosomal GluRS homologue are summarized in Fig. 2. The growth curve (Fig. 2A) shows that GluRS is an essential protein whose depletion results in a growth arrest reminiscent of the one seen in the GlnRS RNAi cell line. The same is true for the biochemical phenotype (Fig. 2, B and C). As expected, the GluRS activity is down-regulated while the GlnRS activity remains unaffected. These data show that a eukaryotic-type GluRS encoded by a single nuclear gene is responsible for all of the cytosolic and mitochondrial GluRS activity that was detected in T. brucei. A comparison of the two knock-down cell lines shows that the specific activities for the two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, measured in either the cytosolic or the mitochondrial fractions, is similar in both cell lines. Furthermore, it was observed that depletion of GluRS occurs faster and that RNAi inhibition appears to be more efficient than the one observed for GlnRS. Recombinant T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS Have the Predicted in Vitro Activities—To confirm the identities of the T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS, recombinant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified to >95% homogeneity (data not shown). Total T. brucei tRNA was aminoacylated in vitro with T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS. These enzymes clearly charged their respective cognate amino acids onto total T. brucei tRNA (Fig. 3). Each enzyme reached an aminoacylation plateau of ∼2.5%. This charging level is consistent with the amount of tRNAGln and tRNAGlu present in total tRNA of T. brucei and of other organisms (11.Tumbula-Hansen D. Feng L. Toogood H. Stetter K.O. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37184-37190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18.Tan T.H. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19.Lapointe J. Duplain L. Proulx M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 88-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that both synthetases charged unfractionated tRNA to a similar level may be a reflection of the discrimination properties of trypanosomal GluRS. Non-discriminating GluRSs, which attach glutamate to tRNAGln in addition to tRNAGlu, obviously attach approximately twice as much glutamate to total tRNA (19.Lapointe J. Duplain L. Proulx M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 88-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This property, which still needs to be rigorously established for the T. brucei enzyme, is essential for their role in the transamidation pathway of Gln-tRNA formation (1.Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20.Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, the T. brucei GluRS is probably a discriminating eukaryotic-type GluRS with 47% identity to the discriminating GluRS from yeast cytoplasm. The eukaryotic nature of the T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS enzymes is also seen in their inability to utilize total E. coli tRNA as a substrate (Fig. 3). T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS Lack N-terminal Extensions—As depicted schematically in Fig. 4, eukaryotic GlnRS and GluRS generally have N-terminal extensions (from 123 to 264 amino acids) with regions of sequence conservation (21.Galani K. Grosshans H. Deinert K. Hurt E.C. Simos G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22.Lamour V. Quevillon S. Diriong S. N'Guyen V.C. Lipinski M. Mirande M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8670-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These extensions appear to be dispensable for aminoacylation in yeast, but the human GlnRS requires the N-terminal extension for catalytic activity (21.Galani K. Grosshans H. Deinert K. Hurt E.C. Simos G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23.Kim T. Park S.G. Kim J.E. Seol W. Ko Y.G. Kim S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the N-terminal extensions are essential for protein-protein interactions, which form the multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complexes described in yeast and higher eukaryotes (21.Galani K. Grosshans H. Deinert K. Hurt E.C. Simos G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23.Kim T. Park S.G. Kim J.E. Seol W. Ko Y.G. Kim S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The need to form a multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex may also explain that the GluRS of higher eukaryotes is encoded by a large open reading frame consisting of an in-frame fusion of GluRS and prolyl-tRNA synthetase (26.Cerini C. Kerjan P. Astier M. Gratecos D. Mirande M. Semeriva M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4267-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Not much is known yet regarding the function of these higher order aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complexes, but in mice they are essential (27.Kim J.Y. Kang Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim H.J. Ahn Y.H. Park H. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The surprising feature of T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS is that they lack extensive N-terminal domains. In addition, the T. brucei GluRS is a smaller protein, which lacks the ProRS and linker domains found in higher eukaryotes (25.Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Instead, T. brucei GlnRS and GluRS possess short (44 and 36 amino acids, respectively) N-terminal regions predicted to be mitochondrial targeting sequences. Preliminary sequence data (ORF LmjF15.1440) show that Leishmania major also encodes a GlnRS with a similarly short N-terminal extension as does the metazoan parasite Schistosoma mansoni (28.Coppin J.F. Lefebvre C. Caby S. Cocquerelle C. Vicogne J. Coustau C. Dissous C. Parasitol. Res. 2003; 89: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The lack of the N-terminal domains suggests that the GlnRS and/or GluRS in these organisms do not form a higher order complex. Using a combination of RNAi-based in vivo studies and in vitro aminoacylation assays with recombinant proteins, we have shown that direct acylation by a eukaryotic-type GlnRS is the route for mitochondrial Gln-tRNA formation in T. brucei. In line with this result, we find that the mitochondrial GluRS is of the discriminating eukaryotic type. This is expected since the presence of a bacterial-type non-discriminating GluRS would be harmful in the absence of the transamidation pathway. Interestingly, in both cases, single nuclear genes for GlnRS and GluRS encode both the cytoplasmic and the mitochondrial activities. Dual targeting of proteins to the cytosol and mitochondria is not unusual. It was also described for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (29.Natsoulis G. Hilger F. Fink G.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 235-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30.Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.-P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this is the first reported case involving GlnRS and GluRS. Different mechanisms by which proteins are simultaneously targeted to the cytosol and mitochondria have been described previously (31.Small I. Wintz H. Akashi K. Mireau H. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 265-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but currently we do not know which one is operating in T. brucei. T. brucei lacks mitochondrial tRNA genes, and its mitochondrial tRNAs consist of an imported fraction of the cytosolic pool. This leads to the paradoxical situation that mitochondrial translation based on bacterial-type ribosomes must proceed exclusively with imported eukaryotic-type tRNAs (32.Schneider A. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The use of eukaryotic-type GlnRS and GluRS to aminoacylate the eukaryotic-type tRNAGln and tRNAGlu may therefore represent an adaptation to this situation. Besides T. brucei, there are two other organisms in which mitochondrial GlnRS activity has been detected. Leishmania tarentolae mitochondria also form Gln-tRNA by direct acylation (5.Nabholz C.E. Hauser R. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7903-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial translation depends exclusively on imported eukaryotic-type tRNAs. However, there are some interesting differences between the two species. T. brucei probably has a single tRNAUUGGln isoacceptor, a fraction of which is imported into mitochondria (18.Tan T.H. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, as shown in this work, it has a single dually targeted GlnRS. The situation is more complex in L. tarentolae where two tRNAGln isoacceptors exist: (i) tRNAUUGGln, which is in part imported into mitochondria, and (ii) tRNACUGGln, which appears to be cytosol-specific (33.Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H.T. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In line with this finding, it was shown that L. tarentolae contains distinct cytosolic and mitochondrial GlnRS activities exhibiting distinct substrate specificities toward the two isoacceptors (5.Nabholz C.E. Hauser R. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7903-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the genes encoding the GlnRS activities have not been identified, and the lack of RNAi methodologies in Leishmania (34.Robinson K.A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) has hampered a more detailed investigation. Mitochondrial GlnRS activity was also detected in Tetrahymena mitochondria (35.Suyama Y. Hamada J. Büchner T. Neupert W. Sebald W. Werner S. Genetics and biogenesis of chloroplasts and mitochondria. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1976: 763-770Google Scholar). The Tetrahymena mitochondrial genome encodes only a subset of tRNAs, and the mitochondrial tRNAGln species is imported from the cytosol (36.Rusconi C.P. Cech T.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The type of GlnRS(s) that exists in Leishmania and Tetrahymena mitochondria has not been determined; however, based on our results in T. brucei, they can be expected to be of the eukaryotic type. The observed correlation between the presence of mitochondrial GlnRS activity and the mitochondrial import of its tRNAGln substrate suggests that mitochondrial GlnRS might be limited to organisms that import eukaryotic-type tRNAGln from the cytosol. Eukaryotes with mitochondria-encoded tRNAGln may use the transamidation pathway or possess a bacterial-type GlnRS. The bacterial ancestor of mitochondria probably had a complete set of tRNA genes. A lack of mitochondrial tRNA genes and import of cytosolic tRNAs is therefore a derived trait (4.Schneider A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 557-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the mitochondrial GlnRS activity was only acquired later in evolution.

We are indebted to Hubert Becker and Bethany Krett for discussions and encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W2101552428,"Vaccinations against various antigens of the central nervous system (CNS) are gaining increasing interest as a therapeutic approach in a variety of neurological diseases such as spinal cord injury, ischemic stroke, Alzheimer disease, or spongiform encephalopathy. In the present work, the time window after spinal cord injury allowing potentially therapeutic antibody to penetrate the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB) was measured by intravenous injection of a monoclonal anti-Nogo-A antibody. Although an influx of Nogo antibodies at the lesion site was detectable up to 2 wk after injury, a significant decrease in BBB permeability was noticed within the first week. Clearly, therefore, a vaccination protocol with a rapid antibody response is required for acute therapeutic interventions after CNS trauma. We designed a conjugate vaccine paradigm with particular focus on the safety and the kinetics of the antibody response. As antigen targets, we used Nogo-A and the strongly encephalitogenic myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Intrasplenic autoimmunization of rats with a Nogo-A-specific region fused to the Tetanus toxin C-fragment (TTC) resulted in a fast IgM response against Nogo-A. A specific switch to IgG was observed as soon as 4-7 days after intrasplenic immunization in TTC-primed animals. In spite of the induction of a specific IgG response after intrasplenic immunization, no signs of experimental autoimmune disease (EAE) or inflammatory infiltrates on histological examinations were observable. In contrast to subcutaneous immunization with MOG, in vitro cytokine secretion assays (IL-2, IL-10, and IFN-gamma) did not reveal activation of MOG-specific T cells after intrasplenic immunization. Our findings have critical implications for future strategies in the development of safe and efficient therapeutic vaccines for neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2016721913,"DNA polymerase β, a member of the X family of DNA polymerases, is known to be involved in base excision repair. A key to determining the biochemical properties of this DNA polymerase is structure-function studies of site-specific mutants that result in substitution of particular amino acids at critical sites. In a previous genetic screen, we identified three 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate-resistant mutants, namely E249K, D246V, and R253M, of polymerase β in the flexible loop of the palm domain. In this work, we perform an extensive kinetic analysis to investigate the role of the D246V mutant on polymerase fidelity. We find that D246V misincorporates T opposite template bases G and C. The mechanistic basis of misincorporation appears to be altered DNA positioning within the active site. We provide evidence that the fidelity of D246V is greatly affected by the base that is 5′ of the templating base. We propose that the Asp residue at position 246 helps to maintain the proper positioning of the DNA within the polymerase active site and maintains the fidelity of polymerase β. Altogether, the results suggest that the flexible loop domain of polymerase β plays a major role in its fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W2096580435,"The physiological role of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform diversity is poorly understood. The expression of MHC-B, which contains an insert at the ATP binding pocket, has been linked to enhanced contractile kinetics. We recently reported that the renal afferent arteriole exhibits an unusually rapid myogenic response and that its kinetic features allow this vessel to modulate tone in response to alterations in systolic blood pressure. In the present study, we examined MHC expression patterns in renal afferent and efferent arterioles. These two vessels regulate glomerular inflow and outflow resistances and control the pressure within the intervening glomerular capillaries (PGC). Whereas the afferent arteriole must respond rapidly to increases in blood pressure, the efferent arteriole plays a distinctly different role, maintaining a tonic elevation in outflow resistance to preserve function when renal perfusion is compromised. Using RT-PCR, Western analysis, and immunofluorescence imaging of intact isolated arterioles, we found that the afferent arteriole predominantly expresses the MHC-B isoform, whereas the efferent arteriole expresses only the slower-cycling MHC-A isoform. We examined the kinetics of angiotensin II- and norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction and found that the afferent arteriole responds approximately 3-fold faster than the efferent arteriole. Our findings thus point to the renal microcirculation as a unique and important example of smooth muscle adaptation in regard to MHC isoform expression and physiological function."

The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a dimeric molecule.

Commenting on the catalytic efficiency of TIM, Knowles (1Knowles J.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) states “This enzyme (TIM) appears to have arrived at the end of its evolutionary development as a catalyst.” It has been argued that the evolutionary pressure for TIM to be a perfect catalyst has been intense, since for “flight or fight” there is an instant requirement for muscle ATP. The catalytic reaction of TIM is chemically simple and involves intermolecular protonation and deprotonation between the enzyme and substrate. The enzyme achieves the proton transfers with the help of certain elements as catalytic tools, a 10-residue loop that closes over the active site and stabilizes the reaction intermediate and a catalytic base and an acid to perform the enolization steps (1Knowles J.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). It is believed that catalysis is a result of stronger binding of the enzyme to its transition state than to the initial enzyme-substrate complex (2Cleland W.W. Kreevoy M.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1887-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Although various schemes for this reaction have been proposed (for a review of the schemes, see Cui and Karplus (3Cui Q. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2284-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)), the most frequently discussed mechanism is the one that involves Glu-165 as the catalytic base in the first proton transfer and His-95 as the catalytic acid for the rest of the reaction (3Cui Q.

The other most-studied part of this enzyme is its catalytic loop 6 dynamics. McDermott and co-workers (12Rozovsky S. Jogl G. Tong L. McDermott A.E. J. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 310: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have done elegant NMR studies on the motion of loop 6 and suggested that loop motion and product release are probably concerted and likely to represent a rate-limiting step for the catalytic reaction. However, the participation of loop 6 (residues 166–176) in positioning the catalytic base with suitable geometry, in protecting the reaction intermediates in its closed state, and in allowing ligand binding and release in its open state are not well understood. To enlighten on all these aspects of this enzyme, it is essential to have a pool of atomic resolution structures of the enzyme complexed with substrate and transition state analogues that will lead to an appreciation of the structural rearrangements at the active site during catalysis. We present here the structural details at 1.1-Å resolution of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) TIM complexed to an inhibitor 2-phosphoglycerate. Unlike the physiological substrate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, the phosphate group is attached to the C2 carbon in 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) and has an additional negative charge and an extra oxygen atom (Fig. 1b). Earlier structural studies on PfTIM-ligand complexes (14Parthasarathy S. Balaram H. Balaram P. Murthy M.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1992-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Parthasarathy S. Ravindra G. Balaram H. Balaram P. Murthy M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13178-13188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggest that a suitable substitution at the C2 carbon of 3PG could be potentially interesting as a lead for anti-malarial drug design. The structure of the PfTIM·2PG complex provides further insights on this possibility and shows how the interactions of the carboxy, phosphate, and hydroxyl groups of the ligand with the protein are altered due to change in the phosphate position. We also present a comparative analysis of this structure with the other two atomic resolution TIM structures, yeast TIM complexed to the natural substrate DHAP (16Jogl G. Rozovsky S. McDermott A.E.

After extending the resolution to the limit of 1.1 Å and including several additional water molecules, R/Rfree values were 0.178/0.199, respectively, for Fo > 4σ(Fo). For further improvement of the model, tightly restrained anisotropic displacement parameters were introduced and refined as recommended (26Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This reduced both R and Rfree values by ∼3%. The final refinement cycle resulted in an R/Rfree values of 0.133/0.171. The final refined structure was subjected to PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) for further assessment of errors. 433 of 450 non-glycine residues were found with (ϕ, Ψ) values in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot. 17 nonglycine residues were in the additional allowed region. The atomic resolution allowed detailed interpretation of electron density including chain disorder, anisotropy, and determination of specific ligand occupancies. The final protein model obtained by refinement at 1.1 Å of resolution corresponds to R and Rfree values of 13.3 and 17.1%, respectively, and has good stereochemical parameters (Table I). 96% of the protein residues lie in the most favored region of the Ramachandran map. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains two subunits (A and B) related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. In both the subunits the final refined electron density was unambiguous for most of the protein atoms except for a few side chains on the protein surface. Totally excluding the loop 6 residues, 11 residues in the A-subunit and 16 residues in the B-subunit were built in more than 1 conformation. Despite the similar structures of the two subunits (root mean square distance for the superposition of all Cα positions (open form) is 0.25 Å), the electron densities at their active sites were considerably different. The electron density observed at the active site of the A-subunit did not account for an intact 2PG molecule but contained two pieces of unequal size. Careful examination of the interactions at the active site helps us to assign 2-oxoglycerate and meta-phosphate as plausible candidates for the larger and the smaller fragments, respectively. In this subunit, loop 6 is observed in an open conformation. In the B-subunit, the catalytic loop 6 has adopted both open and closed forms. The density fits the open conformation of loop 6 very well. The density corresponding to the closed conformation of loop 6 is well defined except for small breaks in the main chain density at residues 168, 170, and 172. There is no density for the side chain of Ile-170 in the closed form. The occupancies of the two conformations were restrained to add to unity in the refinement, which resulted in site occupancy of 0.62 for the open form. Consistent with the dual conformation of open and closed forms of loop 6 in the present case, residues 209–211 were also found in two conformations. In this subunit the electron density corresponding to the ligand at the active site was larger in extension than that of a single 2PG molecule. In addition, refinement of a fully occupied 2PG followed by difference Fourier calculation led to the appearance of negative electron density at the ligand surrounded by positive density, suggesting a partial occupancy for the built ligand. Systematic comparison of TIM complexes shows that the position of the phosphate moiety differs between the loop closed and the loop open forms of the enzyme (data not shown). The displacement of the phosphorous atom between the two forms is around 1.5 Å. Because loop 6 adopts both open and closed conformations in the B-subunit (see “Discussion”) it may be anticipated that the ligand also has two orientations. Careful inspection of the features of the electron density map showed that this is indeed the case. These two orientations of 2PG are referred to as LIGO and LIGC, corresponding to loop open and closed forms respectively in the following paragraphs. The mean anisotropy (26Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) of the protein atoms is 0.432 with a S.D. of 0.171. These correlate with the standard values (0.45, 0.15, respectively) as evaluated by Merritt (27Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). There is asymmetry of anisotropic displacement parameters of the main chain atoms between the subunits (Fig. 2a). The stretch of residues 180–200 shows the maximum difference in anisotropy between the subunits. These residues are more anisotropic in the B-subunit (A < 0.2) compared with the A-subunit (A > 0.4). The maximum anisotropy is observed for Lys-186 in the B-subunit (0.04). The isotropic thermal parameters also appear to be very high for these residues in the B-subunit compared with the A-subunit (Fig. 2b). Examination of the crystal packing for these residues suggests that the observed asymmetry could be an effect of the differences in crystal environment. This high resolution structure determination of the complex 2-phosphoglycerate with P. falciparum triose-phosphate isomerase reveals the following features, 1) chemical cleavage of the ligand molecule bound to the A-subunit, presumably due to radiation damage, 2) predominance of the open conformation of catalytic loop 6 in the B-subunit, even in the presence of the bound ligand, a feature that appears to be a specific characteristic of the Plasmodium enzyme (14Parthasarathy S. Balaram H. Balaram P. Murthy M.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1992-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Parthasarathy S. Ravindra G. Balaram H. Balaram P. Murthy M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13178-13188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the observation of two distinct conformations for several residues that correspond to open and closed forms of loop 6 at the active site of the B-subunit, and 3) the observation of two distinct positions for the ligand in the B-subunit. Each of these features is considered in detail. Interpretation of the Fragmented Ligand Electron Density in Subunit A—The density at the active site of the A-subunit is fragmented and does not account for an intact 2PG molecule. The first impression obtained by the inspection of the fragmented density was that it might correspond to a glycerol used as the cryoprotectant and an acetate ion contained in the crystallization buffer. However, the density for glycerol was not symmetric about the C2 carbon; on the other hand, the branching at C1, which is expected for a carboxylate ion, was clearly visible (Fig. 3a). A second plausible interpretation of the density assigned the fragments as 2-oxoglycerate and meta-phosphate ion. The 2-oxoglycerate fits the larger fragment well. The identification of meta-phosphate ion as responsible for the smaller fragment is supported by the following. 1) One of the oxygen atoms, O1P, of the meta-phosphate interacts with OG atom of Ser-211. Another oxygen atom, O3P, shares a hydrogen bond with amide N of Asn-233. The position of this molecule is such that the third oxygen atom, O2P, points to the solvent region and could be hydrogen-bonded to a disordered solvent molecule. A weak hydrogen bond exists between this oxygen atom and ND2 of Asn-233. Also, various water-mediated hydrogen bonds made by O1P and O3P with the polypeptide stabilize the ion (Fig. 3b). 2) Although unstable, the occurrence of meta-phosphate has been proposed as an intermediate in reactions of phosphate monoesters based on various experiments (29Butcher W.W. Westheimer F.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 2420-2424Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The observed cleavage of 2PG into 2-oxoglycerate and meta-phosphate may be a consequence of damage due to the synchrotron radiation. Cleavage of the phosphorus-oxygen bond under such conditions has not been reported earlier. However, it is known that exposure of bio-macromolecules to ionizing radiation results in damage (30Kumamoto J. Westheimer F.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 2515-2518Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Helliwell J.R. Liddington R. Papiz M.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Some of the radiation induced damages commonly observed in protein structures even at cryogenic temperatures are cleavage of disulfide bonds (34Schroder Leiros H.K. McSweeney S.M. Smalas A.O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), decarboxylation of acidic residues (35Burmeister W.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2002; 9: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The present observation suggests that the energy-rich phosphoester bond is also susceptible to radiation damage. It should be stressed that the meta-phosphate ion (monoanion, PO3-, or dianion, PO32-) has been generally thought to be too unstable to exist in solution (38Bourne N. Williams A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 7591-7596Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 39Skoog M.T. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 7597-7606Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 40Herschlag D. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5172-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An alternative fit to the smaller fragment of the electron density could be an acetate ion. In principle, the acetate ion would be anticipated to form two hydrogen-bonding interactions, in contrast to the meta-phosphate, which has three oxygen atoms available for accepting hydrogen bonds. Examination of the potential hydrogen-bonded interactions reveals that there are two strong bonds involving two of the phosphate oxygen atoms, whereas the third oxygen is close to the ND2 of Asn-233 (3.56 Å). This may or may not correspond to a hydrogen bond as the temperature factor of ND2 of Asn-233 is high (45 Å2). However, the third oxygen atom is in contact with the solvent favoring its assignment to a polar oxygen. In recent years, the structures of several chemically unstable reactive intermediates of carbenes and radicals have been characterized by x-ray analysis. It is therefore possible that the smaller density corresponds to an unstable meta-phosphate ion stabilized by favorable interactions with the proximal groups on the enzyme. Conformations of the Catalytic Loop 6 —It is believed that the catalytic loop 6 in TIM stabilizes the reaction intermediate and the transition states (41Joseph-McCarthy D. Lolis E. Komives E.A. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2815-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), protects the active site from contact with the bulk water (42Pompliano D.L. Peyman A. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3186-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and prevents the phosphate elimination reaction (43Lolis E. Alber T. Davenport R.C. Rose D. Hartman F.C. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6609-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The dynamics of this loop in TIM have been probed by NMR and molecular dynamics studies (12Rozovsky S. Jogl G. Tong L.

J. 1998; 74: 72-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Solid state NMR experiments on yeast TIM (47Williams J.C. McDermott A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8309-8319Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) show that the loop motion is an inherent property of the protein and the time scale of the loop dynamics is of the order of 100 μs. Temperature-jump relaxation spectroscopy has recently been used to show that the substrate release is kinetically limited by loop opening (49Desamero R. Rozovsky S. Zhadin N. McDermott A. Callender R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2941-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was shown earlier that the stabilization of the closed form of the loop significantly contributes to TIM catalysis (50Sampson N.S. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8482-8487Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This may not be true in the case of PfTIM as the structures of complexes of PfTIM with G3P and 3PG reported earlier (14Parthasarathy S. Balaram H. Balaram P. Murthy M.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1992-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Parthasarathy S. Ravindra G. Balaram H. Balaram P. Murthy M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13178-13188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggest a preference of loop 6 for the open conformation. This prevalence of loop 6 in the open form in PfTIM can be attributed to the active site substitution found at the position 96. This residue is serine in all TIM sequences except Plasmodium species, where it is the more bulky phenylalanine. However, in the PGA complex of PfTIM, loop 6 is closed in the C2 form and open in the P212121 form. Interestingly, in the present structure, loop 6 (B-subunit) has been observed in both conformations in the same crystal, although the loop open form is predominant. The two conformations of loop 6 are correlated to features in other parts of the enzyme structure. The stretch of residues YGGS (208–211) is conserved in all the 73 distinct TIM sequences examined (data not shown). The closure and the concomitant changes bring about a number of new interactions between the flexible loop and these residues. In the B-subunit of PfTIM·2PG complex, where the loop 6 is in two conformations, residues 208–211 also exhibit dual conformations, of which one corresponds to the loop open and the other to the loop closed forms. One of the conformations of Ser-211 makes strong hydrogen bonds with the residues at the tip of loop 6. The other residues, Tyr-208, Gly-209, and Gly-210, also contribute significantly to the stabilization of the loop in the closed conformation. It has been shown from molecular dynamics simulations (48Derreumaux P. Schlick T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 72-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-208 and the loop residue Ala-176 plays a crucial role in the loop opening and closing mechanism. In the A-subunit there is only one conformation for this stretch, and that corresponds to the loop open form. The position of Phe-96 as observed in the loop open conformation makes severe short contacts with the closed loop. This steric clash with Ile-170 of loop 6 results in an altered conformation of Phe-96 upon loop closure (15Parthasarathy S. Ravindra G. Balaram"
https://openalex.org/W2008022246,"Arsenic is a pervasive cytotoxin and carcinogen in the environment. Although its mode of action has yet to be fully elucidated, oxidative DNA damage has been suggested. A series of DNA repair-defective human and hamster cell lines associated with sensitivity to oxidative agents were examined for their response to arsenic-induced cytotoxicity. Only the Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells displayed a marked hypersensitive response (greater than twofold). The protective role of the ATM protein was confirmed by the normal response to arsenic displayed by AT cells expressing wild-type ATM. Although the ATM protein plays a pivotal role in response to DNA double-strand breakage, none of the other cell lines with defects in double-strand break repair displayed a similar hypersensitivity. Further examination indicated that concentrations of sodium arsenite as high as 1 mg/l do not generate significant levels of double-strand breaks. Our data suggest that the ATM protein functions in an important but different capacity in the cellular response to arsenic toxicity than it does in response to agents that generate double-strand breaks, such as ionizing radiation. Furthermore, the lack of hypersensitivity to arsenic displayed by the other cell lines calls into question the hypothesis that DNA damage is a significant factor in arsenic cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2109420287,"Histamine signaling is a principal regulator in a variety of pathophysiological processes including inflammation, gastric acid secretion, neurotransmission, and tumor growth. We report that histamine stimulation causes transactivation of a T cell factor/β-catenin-responsive construct in HeLa cells and in the SW-480 colon cell line, whereas histamine did not effect transactivation of a construct containing the mutated response construct FOP. On the protein level, histamine treatment increases phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3-β in HeLa cells, murine macrophages, and DLD-1, HT-29, and SW-480 colon cell lines. Furthermore, histamine also decreases the phosphorylated β-catenin content in HeLa cells and murine macrophages. Finally, pharmacological inhibitors of the histamine H1 receptor counteracted histamine-induced T cell factor/β-catenin-responsive construct transactivation and the dephosphorylation of β-catenin in HeLa cells and in macrophages. We conclude that the canonical β-catenin pathway acts downstream of the histamine receptor H1 in a variety of cell types. The observation that inflammatory molecules, like histamine, activate the β-catenin pathway may provide a molecular explanation for a possible link between inflammation and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2163530709,"Increased Ser phosphorylation of tau microtubule-associated protein in the brain is an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that precedes progression of the disease to frank neuronal disruption. We demonstrate that bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor activation leads to selective Ser phosphorylation of tau in skin fibroblasts from persons who have or will develop AD due to Presenilin 1 mutations or Trisomy 21, but not in skin fibroblasts from normal individuals at any age. The increased signal transduction in AD fibroblasts that culminates in tau Ser phosphorylation reflects modification of the G protein-coupled BK B2 receptors themselves. Both the BK B2 receptor modification and BK-mediated tau Ser phosphorylation are dependent on activation of protein kinase C and can be detected in fibroblasts from persons with Trisomy 21 two decades before the characteristic onset of AD. This dysregulated signaling cascade in AD may thus be expressed throughout life as an aberrant pathway in peripheral tissues more accessible than brain for molecular analysis. The sites of greatest BK B2 receptor expression in brain overlap with those areas displaying the earliest pathology in the course of AD, suggesting that BK receptor pathway dysfunction may be a molecular signature yielding information about the pathogenesis of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2100464177,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plays a critical role in neurodevelopment and survival of midbrain dopaminergic and spinal motor neurons in vitro and in vivo. The biological actions of GDNF are mediated by a two-receptor complex consisting of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface molecule, the GDNF family receptor α1 (GFRα1), and receptor protein tyrosine kinase Ret. Although structural analysis of GDNF has been extensively examined, less is known about the structural basis of GFRα1 function. In this study, based on evolutionary trace method and relative solvent accessibility prediction of residues, a set of trace residues that are solvent-accessible was selected for site-directed mutagenesis.

According to the survival and differentiation responses of these stable PC12 cells upon GDNF stimulation and the GDNF-GFRα1-Ret interaction assay, residues 152NN153, Arg259, and 316SNS318 in the GFRα1 central region were found to be critical for GFRα1 binding to GDNF and eliciting downstream signal transduction.

These findings suggest that distinct structural elements in GFRα1 may be involved in binding to GDNF and Ret. Most biological processes are governed by specific protein-protein interactions. Unfortunately, some macromolecular complexes do not yield x-ray quality co-crystals, and these complexes are frequently beyond the current limits of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Thus, structural knowledge is often limited to either receptor or ligand alone, which by itself lacks explicit binding site information. Even when the structure of a complex is available, it is very difficult to deduce the relative contribution of each individual residue to the total binding energy. In fact, the binding site is a distinct subset of the contact sites. Mutagenesis studies have shown that less than half of the residues buried in the binding interface may contribute ∼90% of the total binding energy (1.Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar).

Sainio K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in sperm cell development (14.Meng X. Lindahl M. Hyvonen M.E.

The neurotrophic and morphogenic activities of GDNF are mediated by its interaction with a multicomponent receptor complex formed by the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase (15.Durbec P.

Nature. 1996; 382: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Four different GFRα receptors have been identified (GFRα1–4), and each of them prefers binding to one of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family ligands (21.Airaksinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). GDNF binds GFRα1 with preferred high affinity. The unprocessed precursor of rat GFRα1 contains 468 amino acids, with a signal peptide at the amino terminus and a stretch of 38 hydrophobic amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. The hydrophobic cluster at the carboxyl terminus is preceded by a group of three small amino acids (Ala, Ser, and Ser), defining a cleavage/binding site for GPI linkage, suggesting that GFRα1 is an extracellular protein that is attached to the outer cell membrane (20.Treanor J.J. Goodman L. de Sauvage F. Stone D.M. Poulsen K.T. Beck C.D. Gray C. Armanini M.P. Pollock R.A. Hefti F. Phillips H.S. Goddard A. Moore M.W. Buj-Bello A. Davies A.M. Asai N. Takahashi M. Vandlen R. Henderson C.E. Rosenthal A. Nature. 1996; 382: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). GDNF, GFRα1, and Ret bind together and subsequently lead to Ret dimerization and activation of the Ret tyrosine kinase. The original model of GDNF signaling proposes a stringent division of labor between GFRα1 and Ret receptors, in which the latter transduces intracellular signaling but cannot bind ligand on its own, and the former binds ligand but is thought not to transduce signals in the absence of Ret. However, GDNF mutants deficient in GFRα1 binding are still able to activate Ret normally, suggesting that at least some Ret molecules are weakly associated with GFRα1 before GDNF binding (22.Eketjall S. Fainzilber M. Murray-Rust J. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5901-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The precise details of receptor complex formation and stoichiometry of components within the complex remain unclear. The GDNF-GFRα1-Ret complex provides an attractive system in which to investigate protein-protein interactions involved in the assembly of multisubunit receptor complexes.The x-ray crystal structure of GDNF (23.Eigenbrot C. Gerber N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and its distinct structural elements involved in GFRα1 binding (12.Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Johnson Jr., E.M.

Commun. 2000; 268: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have been determined. However, less is known about the structure and function analysis of GFRα1. One study has reported that the central region of GFRα receptors constitutes a novel binding domain for cysteine-knot superfamily ligands. The carboxyl-terminal segments adjacent to the central domain are necessary and have modulatory function in ligand binding (25.Scott R.P. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1450-1458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In our work, a set of residues in the central and carboxyl-terminal domain of GFRα1 were investigated for their involvement in functional receptor complex formation and signal transduction by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The selected residues are evolutionarily conserved residues identified by the evolutionary trace method (26.Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and also have relatively high solvent accessibility in PHD prediction (27.Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). After generating stable PC12 cell lines containing this series of GFRα1 mutants, we examined GDNF binding, Ret activation, and differentiation and survival responses to GDNF. Our results indicate that several amino acids in the GFRα1 receptor are critical for binding with GDNF and Ret and mediating the neurotrophic function of GDNF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from MBI. TRIzol reagent was obtained from Invitrogen. Omniscript reverse transcriptase kits were from Qiagen. Pryobest DNA polymerase was obtained from Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Mini-MTM DNA extraction system and gel extraction miniprep kit were from VIOGENE. Plasmid pBluescript SK(+), pCDNA3-GFRα1, and pCDNA3-Ret were generated previously in our laboratory. The poly-l-lysine, fetal calf serum, horse serum, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were purchased from Invitrogen. PC12 cells were the generous gift from the Cell Bank of Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. FuGENE 6.0 was purchased from Roche Applied Science.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG were from Chemicon International, Inc. GDNFs were prepared as described previously (28.Chen Z.Y. Sun J.X. Li J.H. He C. Lu C.L. Wu X.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were purchased from BBI.Evolutionary Trace Analysis, Secondary Structure Prediction, and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Based on the principle of molecular evolution, sequence and structure information can be integrated by evolutionary analysis to determine functional sites in the protein. This method is now called evolutionary trace (ET) (26.Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The improved ET method (29.Landgraf R. Fischer D. Eisenberg D. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30.Armon A. Graur D. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) was used to identify the functional epitopes in the members of the GFRα family. A total of 37 GFRα primary sequences was compiled following a BLAST search with the sequence of rat GFRα1 over the NCBI non-redundant data base. Multiple sequence alignment and dendrogram construction were then carried out by the ClustalX program (31.Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). Secondary structure and residues relative to solvent accessibility predictions of rat GFRα1 were deduced using the PHD predict program (27.Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar).The full-length of rat GFRα1 cDNA was subcloned into pCDNA3.0. Single-stranded DNA from this plasmid was used as a template for oligonucleotide-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (32.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.Generation of Stable PC12 Cells Containing Mutant GFRα1 Receptors—PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and 0.35% glucose. All cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 1.3 × 105 PC12 cells were plated in each well of a 12-well plate (Corning Glass) that had been coated with poly-l-lysine prior to transfection. After overnight incubation, the monolayer cell density would achieve 50–80% confluence. pCDNA3.0-GFRα1 wild type or GFRα1 mutants were co-transfected with pCDNA3.0-Ret plasmid using FuGENE 6.0, and stable PC12 cell lines were selected in medium containing G418.Differentiation and Survival Assay—For the differentiation assay, 2 × 104 PC12 cells stably expressing GFRα1 and Ret constructs were added to each well of a 12-well plate pre-coated with poly-l-lysine. After attachment, the cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml GDNF. Seven days later, the effects of GDNF on cell differentiation were determined. PC12 cells possessing one or more neurites of a length more than twice the diameter of the cell body were scored as positive. Each value was the mean ± S.E. sampled from three independent experiments. For the survival assay, PC12 cells were seeded as described above. After attachment, the cells were switched to serum-free medium plus 100 ng/ml GDNF. Cell survival was quantified by staining with 10 μg/ml fluorescein diacetate (Sigma) after 48 h as described previously (33.Miyamoto M. Morimoto Y. Nozawa Y. Balamurugan A.N. Xu B. Inoue K. Cell Transplant. 2000; 9: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Viable cells were determined by fluorescence microscopy. The value of the viable cell number in culture with the medium-containing serum represented our corrected 100% initial survival. Results are expressed as the percentage of cell counts with respect to the 100% initial value and show the mean ± S.E. of the percentages from three independent experiments.Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Cells were lysed in TRIzol, and the RNA concentration was measured photometrically. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using (dT)16–18. The PCR primer pair 5′-cacaaggccctcaggcagttcttcgac-3′ and 5′-ttgaattgcatttttgagacaagtatt-3′ corresponding to the specific part of GFRα1 was amplified to a 453-bp product. After an initial denaturing step of 5 min at 95 °C, the amplification was carried out for 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. A final amplification for 10 min at 72 °C finished the PCR. The product was cloned into the pBSK vector and verified by DNA sequencing.Immunofluorescence Cell Staining—Cells grown on coverslips were washed briefly with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum at room temperature for 20 min and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight followed by fluorescent secondary antibodies at room temperature for 45 min. Coverslips were mounted with 90% glycerol in PBS and examined by fluorescent microscopy.Phosphorylation and GDNF-GFRα1-Ret Interaction Assays—Confluent PC12 stable cells were serum-starved for 2 h before ligand treatment. Cells were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml GDNF for 15 min at 37 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.02% NaN3, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 60 mm β-octyl glucoside). Lysate protein concentrations were normalized using the Bio-Rad protein assay (34.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213161) Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken from each lysate for protein interaction and phosphorylation assays as described previously (35.Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, polyclonal rabbit anti-GFRα1 and polyclonal goat anti-Ret antibodies were covalently cross-linked to protein G-agarose and used for immunoprecipitation. Monoclonal mouse anti-GDNF, anti-phosphotyrosine, and polyclonal goat anti-Ret antibodies were used for immunoblotting to detect GDNF-GFRα1-Ret complex formation and Ret activation.Circular Dichroism and Unfolding Measurements—Recombinant proteins of wild type GFRα1 and its mutants GFRα1(N152A/N153A), GFRα1(Q247A/D248A/S249A), GFRα1(R259A), and GFRα1(S316A/N317A/S318A) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (36.Wang L.M. Chen Z.Y. Zhang Q. Zhu W. Ding D.F. Lu C.L. He C. Protein Pept. Lett. 2003; 10: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD measurements were performed on a JASCO-715 spectropolarimeter with a scan speed of 20 nm/min and a response time of 0.125 s. The path length of the cuvette was 1 mm. Each spectrum was the average of at least three scans. The protein concentration was 0.2 mg/ml (in 1 × PBS buffer, pH 7.6), except for the samples in the unfolding experiments. The ellipticity at 220 nm under different concentrations of GdmCl was recorded for the unfolding transition profile.RESULTSSite-directed Mutagenesis of Selected Residues in GFRα1— The primary sequences of GFRα family members were retrieved by BLAST search and used for the evolutionary trace analysis. The dendrogram of these sequences separated them into four main clusters that each correlated with a different subgroup in this family from GFRα1 to α4 (data not shown). The globally invariant residues that are conserved in all the GFRα family members were identified; these residues are likely to contribute to important structural domains or some shared functions for the whole family. The class-specific residues of GFRα1, which are conserved in GFRα1 subgroup but are variable in other GFRα subgroups, are considered to be important for delineating the functional specificities of GFRα1 subgroup. The GFRα family receptors have a unique pattern of cysteine residues and lack many of the domains most commonly present in other receptors. Thus, this receptor family likely represents a structurally novel receptor class. Secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility predictions of residues of rat GFRα1 were done by PHD prediction. Our secondary structure predictions results were similar to those reported previously (25.Scott R.P. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1450-1458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). According to the domain boundaries defined by those authors, we also divided the GFRα1 molecule into amino-terminal (three predicted helices), central (four predicted helices and two β-strands), and carboxyl-terminal (two predicted helices) domains of roughly 100, 200, and 100 residues, respectively (Fig. 1). The residues targeted for site-directed mutagenesis are trace residues, both globally invariant residues and class-specific residues, in the central domain or carboxyl-terminal segments adjacent to the central domain of GFRα1 with relatively high solvent accessibility. The selected residues that fit the criteria for mutagenesis are shown in Fig. 1. These residues may be on the protein surface and specify the functional epitopes in GFRα1 that interact with other molecules. Among them, Asn152, Arg171, Arg197, Arg259, and Ser318 are globally invariant residues in the whole family, and Asn153, Lys206, Gln247, Asp248, Ser249, Glu270, Asp284, Ser316, Asn317, Leu326, Lys327, Asp334, and Lys339 are class-specific residues of the GFRα1 subgroup. These residues were mutated into alanine, either individually or in combinations of two or three residues (Table I). Alanine is best suited to the scanning approach because it can accommodate most elements of the secondary structure of proteins and results in minimal structural distortion.Table ISummary of mutants effects of GFRα1 on GDNF and Ret binding, mediating Ret phosphorylation and neurotrophic function of GDNFGFRα1 variantGDNF bindingRet bindingRet phosphorylationActivation of differentiationPromotion of survivalWild-type++++++++++N152A/N153A-++---R171A++++++++++R197A++++++++++K206A++++++++++Q247A/D248A/S249A+++++++R259A-----E270A++++++++++D284A++++++++++S316A/N317A/S318A-++---L326A/K327A++++++++++D334A++++++++++K339A++++++++++ Open table in a new tab The Effects of GDNF on PC12 Cells Stably Expressing GFRα1 and Ret—By stable selection, a series of PC12 cell lines stably expressing GFRα1 mutants and Ret were generated. In order to investigate the key amino acids of GFRα1 involved in its biological function, the effects of GDNF on cell differentiation and survival were evaluated by treating these PC12 cells with 100 ng/ml GDNF. Seven days after treatment, compared with PC12-Ret cell line (negative group) and PC12-GFRα1-Ret cell line (positive group), GDNF could significantly induce neurite outgrowth of PC12-GFRα1(R171A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1-(R197A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(K206A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(E270A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(D284A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(L326A/K327A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(D334A)-Ret, and PC12-GFRα1(K339A)-Ret stable cells (p < 0.05 compared with the PC12-Ret group, Fig. 2, A and D). PC12-GFRα1(Q247A/D248A/S249A)-Ret stable cells gave an intermediate response (p < 0.05 compared with both PC12-Ret and PC12-GFRα1-Ret stable cells (Fig. 2, C and D)). However, GDNF could not induce neurite outgrowth in PC12-GFRα1(N152A/N153A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(R259A)-Ret, and PC12-GFRα1(S316A/N317A/S318A)-Ret stable cells (Fig. 2, B and D). The survival-promoting effects of GDNF on PC12-stable cells were consistent with differentiation responses of PC12 stable cells to GDNF (Fig. 3). Two days after treatment, GDNF could significantly promote survival of PC12-GFRα1-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(R171A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(R197A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(K206A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(E270A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(D284A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(L326A/K327A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(D334A)-Ret, and PC12-GFRα1(K339A)-Ret stable cells in serum-free medium. The survival-promoting effect of GDNF on PC12-GFRα1(Q247A/D248A/S249A)-Ret stable cells was intermediate (p < 0.05 compared with both PC12-Ret and PC12-GFRα1-Ret stable cells, Fig. 3). However, GDNF could not promote survival of PC12-GFRα1(N152A/N153A)-Ret, PC12-GFRα1(R259A)-Ret, and PC12-GFRα1(S316A/N317A/S318A)-Ret stable cells in serum-free medium (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Effects of GDNF on neurite outgrowth in GFRα1-Ret-PC12 cells. After stimulation of GDNF for 7 days, PC12 cells stably expressing GFRα1-Ret and possessing one or more neurites of more than twice the diameter of the cell body were scored as positive. Each value was the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments.

The effect of the 7-kDa proteins on the polymerization and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities of a family B DNA polymerase (polB1) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus was investigated. polB1 degraded both single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA at similar rates in vitro at temperatures of physiological relevance. The 7-kDa proteins were capable of significantly inhibiting the excision and enhancing the extension of matched template primers by the polymerase. However, the proteins did not protect single-stranded DNA from cleavage by polB1. In addition, the 7-kDa proteins did not affect the proofreading ability of polB1 and were not inhibitory to the excision of mismatched primers by the polymerase. The dNTP concentrations required for the effective inhibition of the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of polB1 were lowered from ∼1 mm in the absence of the 7-kDa proteins to ∼50 μm in the presence of the proteins at 65 °C. Our data suggest that the 7-kDa chromatin proteins serve to modulate the extension and excision activities of the hyperthermophilic DNA polymerase, reducing the cost of proofreading by the enzyme at high temperature.

Our data suggest that the 7-kDa chromatin proteins serve to modulate the extension and excision activities of the hyperthermophilic DNA polymerase, reducing the cost of proofreading by the enzyme at high temperature. Hyperthermophiles face a challenging task of maintaining the stability of their genome while allowing efficient DNA transactions at temperatures close to or exceeding the melting point of DNA. Different hyperthermophiles appear to have evolved different strategies in accomplishing this task (1.Sandman K. Pereira S.L. Reeve J.N. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1350-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Sulfolobus, a group of hyperthermophilic archaea, synthesizes copious amounts of small DNA-binding proteins, classified as 7-, 8-, and 10-kDa proteins on the basis of their molecular mass (2.Edmondson S.P.

Previous studies have focused on the 7-kDa proteins from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (Sac7), Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso7), and Sulfolobus shibatae (Ssh7) (10.McAfee J.G. Edmondson S.P. Datta P.K.

All the 7-kDa proteins are very similar, and those from S. shibatae (Ssh7a and Ssh7b) and closely related S. solfataricus (Sso7d-1, Sso7d-2, and Sso7d-3) are identical or nearly identical (7.Mai V.Q.

The proteins bind in the minor groove of DNA, causing a 61° single-step kink in the DNA helix through intercalation. In agreement with their ability to deform DNA, these proteins are capable of constraining DNA in negative supercoils (7.Mai V.Q. Chen X. Hong R. Huang L. J.

Given their cellular abundance and ability to affect DNA structure, the 7-kDa proteins may affect fundamental biological processes such as DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. The potential role of Sso7d in the regulation of gene expression and recombination in Sulfolobus has been implicated in recent studies (22.Kvaratskhelia M. Wardleworth B.N. Bond C.S. Fogg J.M.

Analysis of the effect of the 7-kDa proteins on DNA transactions may help determine how these processes occur in a physiologically relevant environment and how they are adapted to high growth temperature at which Sulfolobus thrives. In this study, we have investigated the effect of the 7-kDa proteins on a hyperthermophilic family B DNA polymerase (polB1) from the crenarchaeon S. solfataricus P2 (8.She Q. Singh R.K. Confalonieri F. Zivanovic Y. Allard G. Awayez M.J. Chan-Weiher C.C. Clausen I.G. Curtis B.A. De Moors A. Erauso G. Fletcher C. Gordon P.M. Heikamp-de Jong I. Jeffries A.C. Kozera C.J. Medina N.

The gene encoding a polB1 homologue from S. solfataricus MT4 has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (24.Pisani F.M. De Martino C. Rossi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2711-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The recombinant polymerase has been characterized, and a role for the protein in DNA replication has been proposed (25.Bohlke K. Pisani F.M. Rossi M. Antranikian G. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26.De Felice M. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Like almost all archaeal family B DNA polymerases, Sulfolobus polB1 possesses intrinsic proofreading 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (27.Perler F.B. Kumar S. Kong H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 48: 377-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that the Sulfolobus enzyme cleaved both dsDNA and ssDNA at similar rates at high temperature, and the exonucleolytic activity of the enzyme remained significant at dNTP levels as high as 600 μm. Binding of the 7-kDa chromatin proteins substantially reduced the excision and enhanced the extension of matched template primers. However, the chromatin proteins did not seem to affect the proofreading ability of polB1. Our data suggest that the archaeal chromatin proteins play an important role in maintaining the critical balance between the polymerization and excision activities of DNA polymerases in hyperthermophiles. Growth of Organisms—S. solfataricus P2 (a generous gift from Dennis Grogan) and S. shibatae (purchased from the American Type Culture Collection) were grown as described previously (28.Brock T.D. Brock K.M. Belly R.T. Weiss R.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1972; 84: 54-68Google Scholar). Proteins—Recombinant S. solfataricus DNA polymerase B1 (polB1) was prepared as a fusion protein containing a His tag at its N terminus as follows. The gene encoding DNA polymerase B1 (open reading frame SSO0552) was amplified from the S. solfataricus genomic DNA, prepared as described previously (10.McAfee J.G. Edmondson S.P. Datta P.K. Shriver J.W. Gupta R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10063-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following pair of primers: 5′-GCCGGATCCATGACTAAGCAACTTACCTTAT/5′-CGCGAGCTCTTAACTATTTCCTTTACTTGGG (BamHI and SacI sites are in bold face). The PCR product was treated with Taq polymerase in the presence of dATP and ligated into plasmid pGEM-T (Promega). The recombinant plasmid was cleaved with BamHI and SacI, and the fragment containing the polB1 gene was cloned into the same sites of the expression vector pET-30a(+) (Novagen). The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). The sequence of the cloned gene was verified by DNA sequencing. For protein expression, the transformant was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol in a Bioflo 3000 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc.) until the optical density at 600 nm reached ∼0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After incubation for 2.5 h, the induced cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A). The cells were immediately disrupted by three cycles of freeze in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 4 °C. After removal of cell debris by ultracentrifugation (120,000 × g, 60 min, 10 °C), the supernatant was heat-treated for 15 min at 70 °C. The sample was clarified by ultracentrifugation (120,000 × g, 30 min, 10 °C). The supernatant was loaded onto a Hitrap chelating column (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A (10 ml), and bound proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient (0–500 mm) in Buffer A (10 ml). Fractions containing the His-tagged recombinant protein, eluted at 150–250 mm imidazole, were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol). The dialyzed sample was applied to a Resource Q column (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with Buffer B (10 ml) and developed with a 15-ml linear gradient (50–1000 mm KCl). Fractions containing the pure recombinant protein were combined, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% (w/v) glycerol and stored at –70 °C. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Native Ssh7 proteins were prepared as described previously (7.Mai V.Q. Chen X. Hong R. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2560-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard (29.Dawson J.M. Heatlie P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 391-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DNA and Substrates—Oligonucleotides used in this study (Table I) were synthesized and purified by gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotide primers were labeled at the 5′ end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP and purified using a G25 microspin column (Amersham Biosciences). Each labeled primer was annealed to template t76 at a molar ratio 1:1.5 to ensure complete hybridization of the primer to the template. Annealing reactions were carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl.Table ITemplate and primersPrimersp155′-CAGTGAATTCGAGCT-3′p305′-CAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATC-3′p425′-CAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGA-3′p42G5′-CAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGG-3′p42T5′-CAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGT-3′p42C5′-CAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGC-3′Templatet763′-TTTTTGTCACTTAAGCTCGAGCCATGGGCCCCTAGGAGATCTCAGCTGGACGTCCGTACGTTCGAACCGCATTTTT-5′ Open table in a new tab Primer Extension/Excision Assays—The standard reaction (10 μl) contained 60 nm polB1, 1–3 nm32P-labeled primer-template substrate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 μm dNTPs, unless otherwise specified. For primer excision assays, dNTPs were omitted from the reaction mixture. A layer of mineral oil was added to each sample to prevent evaporation. The reaction was incubated for 20 min at 65 °C, unless specified, and quenched by the addition of 10 μl of ice-cold 2× loading buffer (95% deionized formamide, 100 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue). When Ssh7 was included in the reaction, a solution (2 μl) containing 3% SDS, 150 mm EDTA, and 15 mg/ml proteinase K was added to the sample, and the mixture was incubated for 45 min at 50 °C before the addition of the loading buffer. The mixtures were then heated for 3 min at 98 °C and immediately cooled on ice. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel in 1× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film or analyzed by using an ImageQuant Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Proofreading Assays—The proofreading ability of polB1 was analyzed by incubating 50 nm polB1 with 10 nm 5′-labeled mismatched substrate p42G/t76 in the presence or absence of Ssh7 (25 μm) for 15 min at 65 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 4 mm MgCl2, and 25 μm dNTPs in a total volume of 10 μl. For samples lacking Ssh7, the chromatin proteins were added back to the mixture to 25 μm after the reaction. The reaction was quenched by the addition of a solution (2 μl) containing 3% SDS, 150 mm EDTA, and 15 mg/ml proteinase K. Following incubation for 1 h at 50 °C, the samples were extracted three times with phenol/chloroform, once with chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was digested with SalI or left untreated. The samples were mixed with ice-cold 2× loading buffer (95% deionized formamide, 100 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue), heated for 3 min at 98 °C, and immediately cooled on ice. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 12% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel in 1× TBE. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Proofreading by polB1 was also examined using a radiolabel incorporation assay. In this method, an unlabeled substrate (10 nm) was incubated for 15 min at 65 °C with 50 nm polB1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 4 mm MgCl2, 40 μm [α-32P]dCTP, and 100 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. The samples were treated as described above. PolB1 Excises ssDNA and dsDNA at Similar Rates at High Temperature—PolB1 possesses both 5′-3′ polymerization and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities. A proofreading exonuclease is capable of cleaving both ssDNA and dsDNA. But the cleavage reaction on ssDNA is minimally affected by temperature whereas that on dsDNA depends strongly on temperature (30.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). To examine the ability of polB1 to excise ssDNA and dsDNA at high temperature, we incubated the protein with either a template primer (p42/t76) or a primer alone (p42) in the absence of dNTPs at 65 °C. As shown in Fig. 1, the labeled 42-nt primer was degraded with similar kinetics in both cases. In a control experiment, we found that the p42/t76 substrate was not denatured at temperatures up to 72 °C under our assay conditions. Moreover, both linearized and nicked plasmid DNAs were readily digested by the enzyme at 65 °C (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that the ends of duplex DNA might have become so destabilized or frayed at the test temperature that base pairing could no longer form a significant energetic barrier for the exonucleolytic action of polB1. Ssh7 Inhibits the Cleavage of a Template Primer by polB1— We then sought to learn how the Ssh7 proteins might affect the robust exonuclease activity of polB1. When Ssh7 was titrated into the cleavage reaction containing substrate p42/t76, the primer became increasingly less susceptible to the degradation by the enzyme (Fig. 2). The same result was obtained irrespective of the order of addition of Ssh7 and polB1 to the substrate. The cleavage of the primer was most drastically reduced when the Ssh7 level reached ∼2.5 μm. It was found that Ssh7 bound short duplex DNA fragments with a Kd of 0.06–0.1 μm and saturated the majority of the DNA molecules in a binding reaction at concentrations greater than ∼1 μm under conditions similar to those employed in the present study (9.Chen X. Guo R. Huang L. Sci. China Ser. C. 2002; 45: 583-592PubMed Google Scholar). So, it appears likely that the significant inhibition of the primer cleavage by polB1 occurs when the duplex portion of the substrate becomes saturated by Ssh7. By comparison, Ssh7 did not affect significantly the cleavage of the 42-nt primer by polB1. This is consistent with the finding that Ssh7 binds poorly to ssDNA (7.Mai V.Q. Chen X. Hong R. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2560-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results also suggest that Ssh7 inhibits the excision of a template primer by polB1 through its interaction with the substrate instead of the polymerase. Effect of Ssh7 on the Polymerase and Exonuclease Activities of polB1—Binding of Ssh7 inhibited the excision by polB1 of a template primer. A question then arose as to whether Ssh7 would also suppress primer extension by polB1. To answer this question, we incubated polB1 with substrate p30/t76 or p42/t76 in the presence of dNTPs. Various amounts of Ssh7 were included in the reaction. Both excision and extension of the primer were apparent in the presence of dNTPs (Fig. 3). A number of prominent reaction products of different lengths were observed, suggesting that the balance between the two opposing activities of polB1 depended strongly on sequence. Addition of Ssh7 clearly enhanced the extension while inhibiting the excision of the primer, resulting in a significant increase in the amount of the full-length extension product. The proteins did not appear inhibitory to primer extension even at 25 μm. The balance between the extension and excision activities of a proofreading DNA polymerase is strongly affected by dNTP concentrations (31.Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 837-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, cleavage of the template primer by polB1 remained significant even when the dNTP levels were raised to 600 μm (Fig. 4). However, when Ssh7 was added to the reaction, the excision activity of polB1 was significantly inhibited at much lower dNTP levels (Fig. 4). The ratio of primer extension over excision achieved at 1 mm dNTPs in the absence of Ssh7 was similar to that at 50 μm dNTPs in the presence of 25 μm of the proteins. Effects of Temperature and Primer Size on the Ssh7-mediated Modulation of the Extension/Excision Activities of polB1—Considering the ability of the 7-kDa DNA-binding proteins to increase substantially the melting temperature of dsDNA in vitro, we then examined how Ssh7 might affect the extension/excision of a template primer by polB1 at temperatures above the melting point of the substrate. We found that, when incubated with polB1 and dNTPs in the absence of Ssh7, much of a 30-mer annealed to a 76-mer (Tm ≈ 68 °C) was extended, mostly to the full-length, at 50 °C, but a large portion of the primer was excised or poorly extended at 80 °C (Fig. 5A). Addition of Ssh7 substantially reduced the excision but increased the extension of the primer at 80 °C. The extension/excision ratio of the primer in the presence of Ssh7 (4 or 8 μm) was about 30 times greater than that in the absence of the proteins. We also tested the effect of Ssh7 on the extension and excision by polB1 of template primers differing in length at a denaturing temperature. A significant amount of the full-length extension product was obtained at 80 °C even with a substrate containing a 15-nt primer (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data suggest that binding by Ssh7 may stabilize base pairing between a primer and its template at an otherwise denaturing temperature, providing a primer terminus suitable for extension by the DNA polymerase. Effect of Ssh7 on the Proofreading Ability of polB1—In view of the effect of Ssh7 on the excision and polymerization activities of polB1, it would be of interest to examine how the chromatin proteins may influence the proofreading ability of the polymerase. So we conducted a primer extension/excision assay on a substrate containing a mismatched base at the 3′ end of the primer (p42G/t76). The assay conditions (15 nm polB1 and a reaction time of 30 s) were chosen such that less than 50% of the substrate would be excised or extended at the end of the reaction. As shown in Fig. 6A, cleavage of the mismatched primer resulted in the appearance of fragments that were slightly shorter than the primer whether or not Ssh7 was present. In comparison, these cleavage products were hardly detectable when the assay was performed on a matched substrate under the same conditions. It appears that the mismatch altered the primer structure or destabilized the template primer, enhancing the excision activity of polB1. Interestingly, excision of the mismatched primer was not suppressed by Ssh7. To determine whether the extension product of the mismatched substrate still contained the mismatch, we increased the amounts of both polB1 and dNTPs in the assay (to 50 nm and 25 μm, respectively) and allowed the reaction to proceed for 15 min. Under these conditions, the majority of the input primers were extended (Fig. 6B). The extension products were then treated with SalI. Because the mismatch occurred at the SalI site of the substrate, an extension product containing the mismatch would not be sensitive to cleavage by SalI whereas an extension product in which the mismatch had been corrected would be digested by the restriction enzyme. When the extension products were cleaved by SalI, a labeled 38-nt fragment would result. As shown in Fig. 6B, extension products from both matched and mismatched substrates were sensitive to the cleavage by SalI, suggesting that the mismatch was efficiently corrected by B1 in the presence or absence of Ssh7. As a control, products of extension from the mismatched substrate by an exonuclease-deficient polB1 were not cleaved by SalI (data not shown). We also tested the ability of polB1 to correct the other two types of mismatches at the 3′ terminus of the primer (p42T/t76 and p42C/t76) in the presence of Ssh7 using a label incorporation assay. Both types of mismatches were also corrected efficiently (Fig. 6C). Based on these results, we conclude that the strong proofreading ability of B1 is not affected by Ssh7. A proofreading DNA polymerase is known to coordinate its polymerase and exonuclease activities to achieve high extension fidelity without incurring a high cost resulting from excessive cleavage of correctly incorporated nucleotides. In this regard, mesophilic DNA polymerases normally cleave double-stranded DNA much less efficiently than single-stranded DNA because of the requirement for melting of the duplex terminus and translocation of the DNA from the polymerase site to the exonuclease site (32.Cowart M. Gibson K.J. Allen D.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). How might a thermophilic DNA polymerase balance its polymerization and excision activities at high temperature, which favors melting or destabilization of duplex DNA? In the present work, we show that DNA polymerase B1 from the hyperthermophilic archaeon S. solfataricus is capable of cleaving dsDNA as efficiently as ssDNA at temperatures of physiological relevance. Similar observations have been reported for family B DNA polymerases from Pyrobaculum islandicum and Thermococcus litoralis and a split polB from Mathanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ΔH (33.Kähler M. Antranikian G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34.Kong H. Kucera R.B. Jack W.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28751-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that, because both ssDNA and dsDNA were cleaved similarly by polB1 at temperatures significantly below the melting point of duplex DNA, the enzyme does not appear to require the substrate to be denatured extensively for efficient exonucleolytic cleavage. Furthermore, deoxynucleoside triphosphates are known to affect the pol/exo balance of a DNA polymerase in favor of polymerization. Although primer extension by polB1 occurred efficiently at a low level (2 μm) of dNTPs, significant excision by the enzyme remained even at 600 μm dNTPs, a concentration far exceeding that found in the cell (≤100 μm) (36.Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). In comparison, DNA polymerase from the thermophile T. litoralis also displays a strong 3′-5′ exonuclease activity on both ssDNA and dsDNA, but the activity on dsDNA was suppressed in the presence of moderate amounts of dNTPs (50% inhibition at 1 μm dNTPs) (34.Kong H. Kucera R.B. Jack W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1965-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strong exonuclease activity of polB1 on the paired primer terminus suggests that hyperthermophiles must have evolved mechanisms to reduce the cost of proofreading, which would otherwise be extraordinarily high at the growth temperatures of the organisms. In Sulfolobus, DNA is densely bound, if not covered entirely, by the 7-kDa DNA-binding proteins (1.Sandman K. Pereira S.L. Reeve J.N. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1350-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2.Edmondson S.P. Shriver J.W. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 334: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Given the effect of these proteins on the structure and duplex stability of DNA, they are likely involved in the modulation of the pol/exo balance of DNA polymerase. Indeed, as demonstrated in this study, the pol/exo balance of polB1 on a primed template was significantly changed in favor of primer extension in the presence of Ssh7 as compared with that in the absence of the proteins. Titration experiments suggest that the level of Ssh7 at which primer cleavage by the polymerase became substantially inhibited was similar to that required for the maximum binding of the proteins to the duplex region of the substrate. In addition, cleavage of single-stranded DNA by polB1 was not inhibited by Ssh7. These data indicate that Ssh7 influences the extension and excision activities of polB1 by affecting the structure of the substrate, and not through protein-protein interactions. As demonstrated by the ability of the 7-kDa proteins to raise the Tm of dsDNA (12.Baumann H. Knapp S. Lundback T. Ladenstein R. Hard T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 808-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16.Guagliardi A. Napoli A. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), binding by these proteins would presumably stabilize the annealing of a primer to its template at high temperature, thereby reducing the availability of unpaired primer ends for excision by the DNA polymerase. We also found that, in presence of small amounts (e.g. 4 μm) of Ssh7, the dNTP levels required for the effective suppression of the exonuclease activity of polB1 were lowered to within the physiologically relevant range. In addition, the effect of Ssh7 on primer extension and excision by polB1 was pronounced on substrates containing short primers (e.g. 15-nt primer), suggesting that the 7-kDa proteins may serve to protect nascent DNA chains from degradation by the exonuclease activity of polB1 at high temperature. Importantly, despite its strong inhibitory effect on the cleavage of dsDNA by polB1, the chromatin proteins did not affect the proofreading ability of the DNA polymerase. As the most abundant DNA-binding proteins in Sulfolobus chromatin, the 7-kDa DNA-binding proteins conceivably play an important role in various DNA transactions that take place under the stressful conditions of high temperature. It is of interest to study these reactions in vitro in both the presence and the absence of the 7-kDa proteins. Results from such comparative studies will provide a physiologically relevant view of these processes and clues to the adaptation of these processes to high temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2103095934,"Nitrogen limitation in <i>Escherichia coli</i> activates about 100 genes. Their expression requires the response regulator NtrC (also called nitrogen regulator I or NR<sub>I</sub>). Phosphorylation of the amino-terminal domain (NTD) of NtrC activates the neighboring central domain and leads to transcriptional activation from promoters that require σ<sup>54</sup>-containing RNA polymerase. The NTD has five β strands alternating with five α helices. Phosphorylation of aspartate 54 has been shown to reposition α helix 3 to β strand 5 (the ""3445 face"") within the NTD. To further study the interactions between the amino-terminal and central domains, we isolated strains with alterations in the NTD that were able to grow on a poor nitrogen source in the absence of phosphorylation by the cognate sensor kinase. We identified strains with alterations located in the 3445 face and α helix 5. Both types of alterations stimulated central domain activities. The α helix 5 alterations differed from those in the 3445 face. They did not cause a large scale conformational change in the NTD, which is not necessary for transcriptional activation in these mutants. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that substitutions in both α helix 5 and the 3445 face diminish the interaction between the NTD and the central domain. Our results suggest that α helix 5 of the NTD, in addition to the 3445 face, interacts with the central domain. We present a model of interdomain signal transduction that proposes different functions for α helix 5 and the 3445 face."
