Here we demonstrate that expression of MCT4 mRNA and protein was increased >3-fold by a 48-h exposure to 1% O2, whereas MCT1 expression was not increased. The effect was mimicked by CoCl2 (50 μm), suggesting transcriptional regulation by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). The predicted promoters for human MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 were cloned into the pGL3 vector and shown to be active (luciferase luminescence) under basal conditions. Only the MCT4 promoter was activated (>2-fold) by hypoxia. No response was found in cells lacking HIF-1α. Four potential hypoxia-response elements were identified, but deletion analysis implicated only two in the hypoxia response. These were just upstream from the transcription start site and also found in the mouse MCT4 promoter. Mutation of site 2 totally abolished the hypoxic response, whereas mutation of site 1 only reduced the response. Gel-shift analysis demonstrated that nuclear extracts of hypoxic but not normoxic HeLa cells contained two transcription factors that bound to DNA probes containing these hypoxia-response elements. The major shifted band was abolished by mutation of site 2, and supershift analysis confirmed that HIF-1α bound to this site. Binding of the second factor was abolished by mutation of site 1. We conclude that MCT4, like other glycolytic enzymes, is up-regulated by hypoxia through a HIF-1α-mediated mechanism. This adaptive response allows the increased lactic acid produced during hypoxia to be rapidly lost from the cell.

We conclude that MCT4, like other glycolytic enzymes, is up-regulated by hypoxia through a HIF-1α-mediated mechanism. This adaptive response allows the increased lactic acid produced during hypoxia to be rapidly lost from the cell. The transport of lactic acid across the plasma membrane is of fundamental importance for all mammalian cells. Glycolytic cells (e.g. white muscle fibers and all cells under hypoxic conditions), must rapidly export lactic acid; other tissues import lactic acid to fuel respiration (brain, heart, and red muscle) or gluconeogenesis (liver and kidney) (1Halestrap A.P.

Transport is mediated by a family of proton-linked monocarboxylate transporters (MCT(s)) 2The abbreviations used are: MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; HRE, hypoxia-response element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. that are also responsible for the transport of other metabolically important monocarboxylates including the ketone bodies. The MCT family has 14 members (3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), 6 of which have been functionally characterized. Of these, only MCT1–MCT4 catalyze proton-coupled transport of lactate (1Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 4Bröer S. Bröer A.

MCT1 is expressed in most cells (1Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), whereas MCT4 is expressed strongly only in glycolytic tissues (e.g. white muscle) that must export large amounts of lactic acid (2Juel C. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 8Wilson M.C. Jackson V.N. Heddle C. Price N.T. Pilegaard H. Juel C. Bonen A. Montgomery I. Hutter O.F.

In rats, MCT2 is found in tissues requiring high affinity uptake of lactate or pyruvate such as liver and kidney (both gluconeogenic) and neurons (lactate and pyruvate oxidation). However, MCT2 is absent in most human tissues, whereas MCT3 expression is largely restricted to the retinal pigment epithelium (see Refs. 1Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar and 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). MCT1, MCT3, and MCT4 require ancillary glycoproteins, either gp70 (Embigin) or, more often CD147 (Basigin), for their expression at the plasma membrane (9Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 10Muramatsu T. Miyauchi T. Histol. Histopathol. 2003; 18: 981-987PubMed Google Scholar). MCT2 does not associate with CD147 (9Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) but requires gp70 for its functional expression (11Wilson M.C. Meredith D. Manning Fox J.E. Manoharan C. Davies A.J. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27213-27221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). MCTs remain associated with basigin or embigin in the plasma membrane, and this interaction is important for their activity (11Wilson M.C. Meredith D. Manning Fox J.E. Manoharan C. Davies A.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3666-3672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Regulation of MCT expression by a variety of stimuli has been demonstrated, especially for MCT1 and MCT4 in skeletal muscle and heart and evidence presented for both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation (reviewed in Refs. 2Juel C. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

Chronic hypobaric hypoxia has been reported to up-regulate MCT4 but not MCT1 in rat skeletal muscle (14Py G. Eydoux N. Lambert K. Chapot R. Koulmann N. Sanchez H. Bahi L. Peinnequin A. Mercier J. Bigard A.X. Metabolism. 2005; 54: 634-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), zebra fish gills (15van der Meer D.L. van den Thillart G.E. Witte F. de Bakker M.A. Besser J. Richardson M.K. Spaink H.P. Leito J.T. Bagowski C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: R1512-R1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and some tumor cells (16Ord J.J. Streeter E.H. Roberts I.S. Cranston D. Harris A.L. Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 93: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), at least in part through a transcriptional mechanism. It is well established that increased rates of glycolysis in hypoxia are associated with greater expression of glycolytic enzymes, including the glucose transporter, Glut-1, caused by a transcriptional mechanism involving the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α) (see Ref. 17Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is stabilized in hypoxia and up-regulates the activity of many glycolytic enzymes and other hypoxia-related genes such as those involved in angiogenesis and vasomotor regulation (see Refs. 17Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 18Huang L.E. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

It binds to a specific hypoxia-response element (HRE) in the promoter of hypoxia-sensitive genes where it often acts in concert with cyclic AMP response element (17Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 18Huang L.E. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19575-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Hypoxia also increases HIF-1α gene expression via a signaling pathway involving mTOR, and insulin (and other growth factors) may act synergistically to enhance HIF-1α levels through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent activation of the mTOR signal transduction pathway (18Huang L.E. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19575-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 20Arsham A.M. Howell J.J. Simon M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29655-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Because MCT4 is the predominant MCT found in glycolytic cells, it might be predicted that its expression would increase in hypoxia to enable export of the increased quantities of lactic acid. In this paper we confirm this to be the case and demonstrate that the effect is mediated by HIF-1α. The predicted gene structures for human MCT1 (SLC16A1, chromosome 1), MCT2 (SLC16A7, chromosome 12) and MCT4 (SLC16A3, chromosome 17) are reported in the human genome databases, and for MCT1 this has been confirmed experimentally (21Cuff M.A. Shirazi Beechey S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A schematic representation for each is shown in Fig. 1. The intron/exon boundaries are largely conserved and there is a non-coding exon in the 5′-untranslated region, which inspection of the EST data base suggests may be spliced out in some mRNA transcripts (3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). A single promoter of human MCT1 has been identified (21Cuff M.A. Shirazi Beechey S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas for chicken MCT3 the presence of two alternative promoters that are developmentally regulated has been proposed (22Yoon H.Y. Philp N.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However there are no published data on the MCT2 and MCT4 promoters. Here we identify the human MCT2 and MCT4 promoters and demonstrate that two hypoxia-response elements, conserved in the human and mouse MCT4 promoter, are responsible for the up-regulation of MCT4 by hypoxia. Neither MCT1 nor MCT2 are up-regulated by hypoxia because their promoters lack the corresponding HREs. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. HeLa and COS cells were purchased from ATCC, and wild-type and HIF-1α knock-out Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were kindly donated by Peter Ratcliffe (Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences, Oxford, UK) who also provided the spx24 promoter construct. The cardiomyocyte line HL-1 was provided by William Claycomb (LSU Health Sciences Centre, New Orleans, LA). Polyclonal antibodies against human and rat MCT1, MCT4, and CD147 were raised as described previously (11Wilson M.C. Meredith D. Manning Fox J.E. Manoharan C. Davies A.J. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27213-27221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Antibodies against cardiac-specific myosin light chain were from AbCam (Cambridge, UK), and antibodies for Glut-1 were a kind gift of Steve Baldwin (University of Leeds). Cell Culture—HeLa and COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), while CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F12 medium (Invitrogen). Both media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. HL-1 cells were cultured in Claycomb medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) as described previously (23Chaudary N. Shuralyova I. Liron T. Sweeney G. Coe I.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air at saturation humidity. For hypoxic stimulation, cultures were flushed with a gas mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2 in a modular incubator (Billups-Rothenburg, Del Mar, CA). Generation of Promoter Constructs—To identify the MCT4 promoter previously cloned cDNA sequences for human MCT4 gene (24Price N.T. Jackson V.N. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) were compared with the human data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST), and the probable 5′-end of the mRNA was assumed to be provided by the longest 5′-sequence. This sequence was then compared with the human genomic data base using BLASTn to identify the 5′-flanking region of the human MCT4 gene that was likely to contain the MCT4 promoter. This was amplified by a PCR of human genomic DNA using primers ProA and ProB (supplemental Table 1) to generate a 3576-bp product containing KpnI (5′-end) and SacI (3′-end) restriction sites that flanked a 2094-bp restriction fragment corresponding to the full-length hMCT4 construct reported in supplemental Fig. 1. Conditions for PCR were: 15 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min followed by 15 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The 3576-bp product was cloned into pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega), and its sequence was confirmed prior to excising the 2094-bp promoter sequence with KpnI and SacI and ligating into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) also cut with KpnI and SacI. Human MCT1 Promoter—A section within the published human MCT-1 promoter region (between bases –1342 and +216, based on the numbering used in Ref. 21Cuff M.A. Shirazi Beechey S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the following primers: forward primer, Prom1F and reverse primer, Prom1R (supplemental Table 1). PCR was performed using genomic DNA as the template with the following protocol: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The single 1562-bp band was gel-extracted and cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega). The promoter fragment was subsequently excised by digestion with EcoRI and subcloned into the CFP-N vector. HindIII and KpnI digestion of the resulting construct produced a 1558-bp hMCT1 promoter fragment that was ligated into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Human MCT2a and MCT2b Promoters—Possible promoter regions for the human MCT2 gene were identified by comparison of 5′-sequences of published MCT2 mRNAs to the human genomic data base. There are two different transcripts for human MCT2 that align with the two possible first exons 1a and 1b, suggesting two promoter regions (see Fig. 1). These 5′-flanking regions were amplified by PCR using primers Prom2aF and Prom2aR, and Prom2bF and Prom2bR respectively, to produce a 526-bp (hMCT2a promoter) and 1704-bp (hMCT2b promoter) fragment. PCR was performed using genomic DNA as template with the following conditions: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1.5 min (0.5-min extension time for the 526-bp fragment), with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. These PCR-generated promoter fragments were subcloned into the pGEM-T-easy vector. The 526-bp hMCT2a fragment was excised by digestion with EcoRI and ligated into the pBS vector, followed by digestion with KpnI and SacI; the resulting promoter region was subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector. The 1704-bp hMCT2b promoter region was excised from pGEM-T-easy by digestion with MluI and XhoI and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector. Mouse MCT4 Promoter—The same strategy of 5′-mRNA and genomic sequence comparison was employed to identify 5′-flanking sequence of the mouse MCT-4 gene. An upstream region was amplified by PCR using the primers ProM4F and ProM4R shown in supplemental Table 1 and produced a 563-bp product. The presence of restriction sites KpnI to the 5′-end of the forward primer and HindIII to the 3′-end of the reverse primer allowed digestion and cloning into the pGL3-basic vector, producing a 547-bp mMCT-4 luciferase construct. Transient Transfection of Cells—Cells were seeded in a sterile 96-well culture plate (Isoplate, Wallac) at 104 cells/well and incubated overnight. Using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), each well was transfected for 4 h with 100 ng of pGL3-promoter construct encoding a modified firefly luciferase gene (or the empty pGL3 vector) co-transfected with 12.5 ng of pRL-SV40 (Promega) encoding the Renilla luciferase gene. After 48 h under hypoxic or normoxic conditions cells were assayed for luciferase activity in a Packard Lumicount™ using the Dual-Glow™ Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Promoter activities were expressed as a ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase luminescence in each well. Deletion and Mutational Analysis of the MCT4 Promoter—Successive 5′-truncations of the full-length hMCT-4 promoter from –2011/+83 to –67/+83 were generated by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotide primers (supplemental Table 1). In all cases, the reverse primer was ProB and a KpnI site was added to the 5′-end of all forward primers. The resultant PCR products were subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector as described above. Site-directed mutations corresponding to the critical HIF-1 binding sites 1 and 2 (see Fig. 4) were introduced into the hMCT-4 –396/+83 construct using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing (ABC Sequencing, Imperial College London, UK). The primers used are reported in supplemental Table 1. Western Blotting of Cell Extracts—Cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted at 4 °C before resuspending in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine at 0.5 mm) plus leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin at 4 μg/ml). After 20 min at 0 °C, samples were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing whole-cell protein extract assayed for protein (Bradford). Samples (20 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (9Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 11Wilson M.C. Meredith D. Manning Fox J.E. Manoharan C. Davies A.J. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27213-27221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) using polyclonal antibodies against MCT1, MCT4, and CD147 at 1 in 1,000 and human Glut-1 at 1 in 5,000. Blots were developed using chemiluminescence (anti-rabbit secondary antibody with ECL detection kit, Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells and DNase treated using the Ribopure RNAwiz kit (Ambion®). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using 2.5 μm oligo(dT) random hexamer primers and Moleney-murine-leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (2.5 units/μl) in buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTPs, and 4 μl of 10 × buffer, as supplied by Roche Diagnostics. Real time PCR was performed using 10 ng of reverse-transcribed total RNA with 0.8 μm sense and antisense primers (see supplemental Table 1) and 10 μl of absolute QPCR-SYBRgreen mix (ABgene), which consisted of the Thermo-start® DNA polymerase and reaction buffer in a total volume of 20 μl. The reactions were performed using DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (MJ Research, Inc.). Quantification of samples was performed using a standard curve constructed by amplifying serial dilutions of cDNA from untreated cells and plotting cycle threshold (CT) values as a function of dilution factor from the starting concentration of cDNA. The slope of this plot was used to calculate relative expression of the gene in question, and data were normalized to amount of 18 S ribosomal RNA in the same sample. Nuclear Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)— Nuclear extracts were prepared from normal or treated cells using the nuclear extraction kit (Chemicon International). The synthetic oligonucleotides (Sigma-Genosys) used as probes or competitors were derived from the HIF-1 binding sequences present in the hMCT-4 promoter (see supplemental Table 1) and were annealed to their respective complementary strands. Labeling of the 5′-nucleotide of the double-stranded probes was performed with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 μCi/mol) using polynucleotide kinase (Roche Diagnostics). EMSAs were performed using binding reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 10 μg of nuclear extracts with binding buffer (48 mm Hepes, 16 mm Tris, 240 mm KCl, 4 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 40% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.9) and labeled probe (20,000 dpm). After incubation at room temperature for 45 min, samples were resolved on non-denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer (25 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 150 V for ∼3 h. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Competition and supershift experiments were performed by preincubating nuclear extract with a molar excess of relevant competitor oligonucleotide at room temperature for 15 min or 6 μg of monoclonal HIF-1α antibody (Transduction Laboratories) on ice for 30 min prior to the addition of labeled probe. Hypoxia Increases Expression of MCT4 but Not MCT1—In Fig. 2A we present Western blots demonstrating that hypoxia (1% O2 for 48 h) increased the expression of MCT4 protein in HeLa, COS, and HL-1 cells, whereas the expression of MCT1 was unaffected. HL-1 cells are a cardiac myocyte cell line that expresses cardiac myosin light chain whose expression, like MCT1, was also unaffected by hypoxia. In HeLa cells we confirmed the well documented up-regulation of Glut-1 by hypoxia, which is known to be mediated by HIF-1α (25Behrooz A. Ismail-Beigi F. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 105-110PubMed Google Scholar). In COS cells we confirmed that the hypoxia mimic, cobalt (50 μm), also up-regulated MCT4 expression, another indicator of the role of HIF-1α (26Ho V.T. Bunn H.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2B we used quantitative PCR to demonstrate that the increase in MCT4 expression was accompanied by an increase in mRNA for MCT4 but not that of MCT1, which was significantly decreased by hypoxia. These data suggest that hypoxia up-regulates MCT4 expression by increasing transcription of the MCT4 gene, consistent with a role for HIF-1α. The MCT4 Promoter Is Activated by Hypoxia, but the MCT1 and MCT2 Promoters Are Not—The putative human and mouse MCT promoter sequences were cloned into the pGL3 vector and promoter activity determined using the expression of firefly luciferase measured by luminescence (see “Materials and Methods”). Co-transfection with the pRL-SV40 vector encoding the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the constitutive SV40 promoter provided a control for transfection efficiency and data are expressed as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luminescence. Data re shown in Fig. 3 Under normoxic conditions, for all promoter constructs except that for MCT2b, firefly luminescence was significantly greater than for the empty pGL3 vector promoter confirming that we had cloned the active promoter. The exception of the MCT2b promoter is not surprising because evidence for this promoter activity is only found in ESTs from testis suggesting that in other cells its activity is suppressed. The increase in both human and mouse MCT4 promoter activity by hypoxia was 2–3-fold. Spx24, a promoter containing 6 HREs was used as a positive control and gave a large (5–10-fold stimulation) of activity under the same conditions, consistent with multiple HREs. These data provide further evidence for regulation of the MCT4 promoter by hypoxia and are consistent with a role for HIF-1α. Identification of Regions in the hMCT4 Promoter Critical for Hypoxia-inducible Transcription—Inspection of the cloned human MCT4 promoter revealed the presence of four putative HREs with the characteristic motif, 5′-RCGTG-3′. These were present at positions –1290/–1285, –511/–506, –88/–83, and –75/-70 (see supplemental Fig. 1), as indicated schematically in Fig. 4. To identify which, if any, of these sequences might be responsible for mediating the response to hypoxia, we first created the truncated promoter constructs shown in Fig. 4. Their promoter activity was then tested in HeLa cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions as shown in Fig. 5A. Truncation of the promoter to a length of 478 bp (–396/+83 construct) removed two HREs, yet the response to hypoxia was unchanged. However, further truncation to remove the final two HREs abolished any stimulatory effect of hypoxia. These data suggest that it may be the first two HREs that are responsible for the stimulation of promoter activity by hypoxia; this was confirmed by making site-directed mutants of these HRE sites as shown in Fig. 5B. When site 1 (nearest the transcription start site) was mutated there was a significant (∼50%) reduction in the stimulation of promoter activity by hypoxia. However, when site 2 was mutated, stimulation by hypoxia was totally abolished as it was when both sites were mutated. Our data suggest that HRE site 2 plays the most important role in mediating the hypoxic response but that site 1 may have a facilitating role. HIF-1α Is Responsible for the Stimulation of MCT4 Expression by Hypoxia—Final confirmation that it is HIF-1α that is responsible for the effect of hypoxia on MCT4 expression was provided by the use of CHO cells in which HIF-1α had been knocked out. As shown in Fig. 6, the human MCT4 promoter is active in wild-type CHO cells and shows a similar response to hypoxia to that observed in HeLa cells. Here too, the deletion of HRE sites 3 and 4 was without effect, but removal of site 2 abolished the response to hypoxia. However, in the HIF-1α knock-out cells, although basal promoter activity was normal, there was no response to hypoxia even with the full-length promoter. As expected, the response to hypoxia could be restored to the HIF-1α knock-out cells by co-transfection with HIF-1α (supplemental Fig. 2). Hypoxia Induces a Transcription Factor That Binds to HRE Sequences in the Human MCT4 Promoter—Further confirmation that it is HIF-1α binding to the HRE sites that is responsible for the hypoxic response was provided by the EMSA (or gel shift) shown in Fig. 7. When a 32P-labeled DNA probe corresponding to the promoter sequence containing HRE sites 1 and 2 was mixed with nuclear extract from control and hypoxic HeLa cells, several shifted bands were observed, corresponding to the probe bound to transcription factors. Only two of these bands, the top two, were increased in the extracts from the hypoxic cells, with the greatest effect being seen on the very top band. Both bands were abolished by the presence of a molar excess of unlabeled MCT4 probe or by unlabeled probe corresponding to the HRE sites of the erythropoietin or vascular endothelial growth factor promoters (Fig. 7). These data imply that the transcription factor(s) that are up-regulated by hypoxia bind to these HRE sites. The data of Fig. 8 confirm this in two ways. In Fig. 8A we used labeled probes in which HRE sites 1 and 2 had been mutated. Mutation of site 2 abolished binding of probe to the topmost band, whereas this was unchanged with the site 1 mutant that reduced, rather than abolished, binding to the lower band. Both effects were observed with the double mutant. In Fig. 8B we performed competition studies in which binding of labeled WT-probe was competed with excess cold probes. As predicted from the data of Fig. 8A, only probes with mutation in site 1, but not in site 2, competed strongly for the upper band. Taken together, these data are consistent with the promoter assays of Fig. 5B and suggest that it is the upper band, corresponding to the transcription factor binding to site 2, that plays the dominant role in the response to hypoxia. Binding of another factor to site 1, producing the lower band, may play a facilitatory role to enhance the activation occurring at site 2. To demonstrate that it is HIF-1α that plays the dominant role and binds to HRE site 2, we performed the supershift assay shown in Fig. 9. This shows that incubation of nuclear extract and 32P-labeled DNA probe with an antibody against HIF-1α caused the topmost band, corresponding to the probe bound to site 2, to migrate still higher up the gel. Up-regulation of MCT4 Expression by Hypoxia Is Mediated by HIF-1α—In this paper we have demonstrated that MCT4 expression is up-regulated in response to hypoxia through enhanced gene transcription mediated by HIF-1α. Thus we have shown an increase in both MCT4 protein and mRNA expression in response to hypoxia (Fig. 2) and demonstrated that the promoter is activated by hypoxia (Fig. 3) but not in HIF-1α knock-out cells (Fig. 6). We have identified two HRE sites just upstream of the proposed transcription start site whose mutation abolishes (site 2) or reduces (site 1) the effect of hypoxia (Fig. 5). The presence of two HREs, with an imperfect inverted repeat and separated by 8 nucleotides is a common attribute of genes regulated by hypoxia (27Kimura H. Weisz A. Ogura T. Hitomi Y. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. DAcquisto F. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2292-2298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, sites 1 and 2 of the hMCT4 promoter conform to this arrangement and the sequence is conserved in the mouse MCT4 promoter (Fig. 4B), which is also up-regulated by hypoxia (Fig. 3). Gel-shift experiments have shown that site 2 binds a transcription factor that is up-regulated in response to hypoxia (Figs. 7 and 8), and confirmation that this transcription factor is HIF-1α was provided by supershift assay (Fig. 9). Site 1 may also bind a transcription factor (Fig. 8) implying that this site plays a facilitatory role for the hypoxic response, whereas site 2 is essential (Fig. 5). The identity of this second transcription factor is unknown, but this site may fulfill the role of a HIF-1 ancillary sequence as defined by Kimura et al. (27Kimura H. Weisz A. Ogura T. Hitomi Y. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. DAcquisto F. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2292-2298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These authors have shown that constitutively active proteins may bind to the HIF-1 ancillary sequence site regardless of the hypoxic stimuli. However, our data demonstrate that the transcription factor binding to site 1 is enhanced by hypoxia (Fig. 7), although this might be because of the increase in HIF-1α, in response to hypoxia, facilitating the further binding of a constitutively expressed protein. The Physiological Role of MCT4 Up-regulation by Hypoxia—We have previously described how MCT4 expression is prevalent only in those tissues, such as white muscle, that rely primarily on glycolysis to provide their ATP and that the kinetic characteristics of MCT4 are especially suited for transporting lactic acid out of glycolytic cells (2Juel C. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 7Manning Fox J.E. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus the observed up-regulation of MCT4 in hypoxia, rather than MCT1 or MCT2, is exactly what would be predicted. Indeed, the MCT4 promoter joins those of other glycolytic enzymes that are regulated by HIF-1α, including aldolase A, enolase 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, and glucose transporter 1 (17Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). In vivo studies on MCT expression in hypoxia are limited, but it has been shown that in rats subject to hypobaric conditions up-regulation of MCT4 mRNA and protein is observed in slow oxidative muscles, whereas MCT1 mRNA, but not protein, is down-regulated (14Py G. Eydoux N. Lambert K. Chapot R. Koulmann N. Sanchez H. Bahi L. Peinnequin A. Mercier J. Bigard A.X. Metabolism. 2005; 54: 634-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This exactly parallels what we observed in our in vitro studies on HeLa cells (Fig. 2). It is of interest that HIF-1α has been shown to be up-regulated in many cancers and is likely to play a critical role in allowing tumor cells to grow under hypoxic conditions found in solid tumors (28Maxwell P.H. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Indeed, expression of MCT4 mRNA, along with other HIF-1-responsive gene products, is increased in aggressive bladder cancers consistent with their enhanced rates of glycolysis and thus their need to export large amounts of lactic acid (16Ord J.J. Streeter E.H. Roberts I.S. Cranston D. Harris A.L. Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 93: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). T3 increases MCT4 expression in skeletal muscle (29Wang Y.X. Tonouchi M. Miskovic D. Hatta H. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E622-E628Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and human skin fibroblasts (30Moeller L.C. Dumitrescu A.M. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and an up-regulation of HIF-1α expression has been implicated in this effect (30Moeller L.C. Dumitrescu A.M. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Inspection of the MCT1 and MCT2 promoters does not reveal the presence of any likely HRE sequences, and this is confirmed by the lack of any stimulatory effect of hypoxia on their promoter activities (Fig. 3). MCT1 is up-regulated in response to increased work in both heart and muscle, although the mechanisms responsible remain to be elucidated. However, there is evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of MCT1 expression perhaps involving factors binding to the unusually long 3′-untranslated region (see Ref. 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The expression of MCT2 is extremely species-dependent and little is known about its regulation. In the rat MCT2 expression appears to be largely restricted to those tissues, such as kidney, liver, testes, and neurons, that require a high affinity uptake mechanism for l-lactate-dependent gluconeogenesis or respiration (1Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2020499438,"Catalytic processes on surfaces have long been studied by probing model reactions on single-crystal metal surfaces under high vacuum conditions. Yet the vast majority of industrial heterogeneous catalysis occurs at ambient or elevated pressures using complex materials with crystal faces, edges and defects differing in their catalytic activity. Clearly, if new or improved catalysts are to be rationally designed, we require quantitative correlations between surface features and catalytic activity—ideally obtained under realistic reaction conditions1,2,3. Transmission electron microscopy4,5,6 and scanning tunnelling microscopy7,8 have allowed in situ characterization of catalyst surfaces with atomic resolution, but are limited by the need for low-pressure conditions and conductive surfaces, respectively. Sum frequency generation spectroscopy can identify vibrations of adsorbed reactants and products in both gaseous and condensed phases9, but so far lacks sensitivity down to the single molecule level. Here we adapt real-time monitoring of the chemical transformation of individual organic molecules by fluorescence microscopy10,11,12 to monitor reactions catalysed by crystals of a layered double hydroxide immersed in reagent solution. By using a wide field microscope, we are able to map the spatial distribution of catalytic activity over the entire crystal by counting single turnover events. We find that ester hydrolysis proceeds on the lateral { } crystal faces, while transesterification occurs on the entire outer crystal surface. Because the method operates at ambient temperature and pressure and in a condensed phase, it can be applied to the growing number of liquid-phase industrial organic transformations to localize catalytic activity on and in inorganic solids. An exciting opportunity is the use of probe molecules with different size and functionality, which should provide insight into shape-selective or structure-sensitive catalysis13,14,15 and thus help with the rational design of new or more productive heterogeneous catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W2021470958,"The control of epidemic malaria is a priority for the international health community and specific targets for the early detection and effective control of epidemics have been agreed. Interannual climate variability is an important determinant of epidemics in parts of Africa where climate drives both mosquito vector dynamics and parasite development rates. Hence, skilful seasonal climate forecasts may provide early warning of changes of risk in epidemic-prone regions. Here we discuss the development of a system to forecast probabilities of anomalously high and low malaria incidence with dynamically based, seasonal-timescale, multi-model ensemble predictions of climate, using leading global coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models developed in Europe. This forecast system is successfully applied to the prediction of malaria risk in Botswana, where links between malaria and climate variability are well established, adding up to four months lead time over malaria warnings issued with observed precipitation and having a comparably high level of probabilistic prediction skill. In years in which the forecast probability distribution is different from that of climatology, malaria decision-makers can use this information for improved resource allocation."

https://openalex.org/W2152200928,"The critical viral components for packaging DNA, recognizing and binding to host cells, and injecting the condensed DNA into the host are organized at a single vertex of many icosahedral viruses. These component structures do not share icosahedral symmetry and cannot be resolved using a conventional icosahedral averaging method. Here we report the structure of the entire infectious Salmonella bacteriophage epsilon15 (ref. 1) determined from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, without icosahedral averaging. This structure displays not only the icosahedral shell of 60 hexamers and 11 pentamers, but also the non-icosahedral components at one pentameric vertex. The densities at this vertex can be identified as the 12-subunit portal complex sandwiched between an internal cylindrical core and an external tail hub connecting to six projecting trimeric tailspikes. The viral genome is packed as coaxial coils in at least three outer layers with approximately 90 terminal nucleotides extending through the protein core and the portal complex and poised for injection. The shell protein from icosahedral reconstruction at higher resolution exhibits a similar fold to that of other double-stranded DNA viruses including herpesvirus, suggesting a common ancestor among these diverse viruses. The image reconstruction approach should be applicable to studying other biological nanomachines with components of mixed symmetries."

https://openalex.org/W2097560797,"A hallmark feature of DNA replication is the coordination between the continuous polymerization of nucleotides on the leading strand and the discontinuous synthesis of DNA on the lagging strand1. This synchronization requires a precisely timed series of enzymatic steps that control the synthesis of an RNA primer, the recycling of the lagging-strand DNA polymerase, and the production of an Okazaki fragment. Primases synthesize RNA primers at a rate that is orders of magnitude lower2,3,4 than the rate of DNA synthesis by the DNA polymerases at the fork. Furthermore, the recycling of the lagging-strand DNA polymerase from a finished Okazaki fragment to a new primer is inherently slower than the rate of nucleotide polymerization5. Different models have been put forward to explain how these slow enzymatic steps can take place at the lagging strand without losing coordination with the continuous and fast leading-strand synthesis6,7,8. Nonetheless, a clear picture remains elusive. Here we use single-molecule techniques to study the kinetics of a multiprotein replication complex from bacteriophage T7 and to characterize the effect of primase activity on fork progression. We observe the synthesis of primers on the lagging strand to cause transient pausing of the highly processive leading-strand synthesis. In the presence of both leading- and lagging-strand synthesis, we observe the formation and release of a replication loop on the lagging strand. Before loop formation, the primase acts as a molecular brake and transiently halts progression of the replication fork. This observation suggests a mechanism that prevents leading-strand synthesis from outpacing lagging-strand synthesis during the slow enzymatic steps on the lagging strand."

Triacylated lipopeptides are assumed to be recognized by TLR2/TLR1-, whereas diacylated lipopeptides use TLR2/TLR6 heteromers for signaling. Following our initial discovery of TLR6-independent diacylated lipopeptides, we could now characterize di- and triacylated lipopeptides (e.g. Pam2C-SK4, Pam3C-GNNDESNISFKEK), which have stimulatory activity in TLR1- and in TLR6-deficient mice. Furthermore, for the first time, we present triacylated lipopeptides with short length ester-bound fatty acids (like PamOct2C-SSNASK4), which induce no response in TLR1-deficient cells. No differences in the phosphorylation of MAP kinases by lipopeptide analogs having different TLR2-coreceptor usage were observed. Blocking experiments indicated that different TLR2 heteromers recognize their specific lipopeptide ligands independently from each other. In summary, a triacylation pattern is necessary but not sufficient to render a lipopeptide TLR1-dependent, and a diacylation pattern is necessary but not sufficient to render a lipopeptide TLR6-dependent.

The innate immunity is the first barrier against foreign pathogens, including bacteria. In contrast to the adaptive immune system, which recognizes specific epitopes with highly variable immune receptors coded by rearranged genes, the innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns by genetically invariant receptors, so-called pattern recognition receptors (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6107) Google Scholar).

Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). So far, 11 TLR have been described. For most of them, except TLR10, natural ligands have been identified. These include various proteins, lipopeptides (LP), lipoteichoic acid, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and oligonucleotides (double-stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA, and DNA) (2Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). TLR are type I transmembrane receptors having an extracellular domain of leucine-rich repeats, which are thought to be involved in ligand recognition. The intracellular domain of TLR contains regions that are highly homologous to the intracellular domain of the IL-1 receptor, the so-called Toll/IL-1 receptor domain, which is involved in the recruitment of downstream signaling molecules. Various microbial cell wall constituents have been reported to signal through TLR2. Prominent representatives are bacterial LP and lipoteichoic acid (3Hirschfeld M. Kirschning C.J. Schwandner R.

Among the TLR2-dependent bacterial ligands, the LP are prime candidates for analyzing the structural requirements of ligands to address TLR2. LP are structural membrane components in various bacterial species exhibiting different molecular structures. In addition, the chemical synthesis of LP analogs provides a vast variety of chemically defined molecules (9Wiesmüller K.-H. Bessler W.G. Jung G. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Spohn R. Buwitt-Beckmann U. Brock R. Jung G. Ulmer A.J. Wiesmüller K.-H. Vaccine. 2004; 22: 2494-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Bacterial LP possess di-O-acylated S-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-cysteinyl residues N-terminally coupled to distinct polypeptides. Examples include the macrophage-activating lipopeptide from Mycoplasma fermentans (MALP2) (11Mühlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Süssmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), the Mycoplasma salivarium lipoprotein FSL-1, and the LP from the N terminus of the cytochrome subunit of the photoreaction center of Rhodopseudomonas viridis (12Metzger J.W. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Loleit M. Eckert M. Bessler W.G. Jung G. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The S-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-cysteine may be acylated with a third amide-linked fatty acid, as is the case for the LP from the cell wall of Escherichia coli (13Braun V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 335-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and its synthetic lipohexapeptide analog Pam3C-SK4 (14Metzger J. Wiesmüller K.-H. Schaude R. Bessler W.G. Jung G. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1991; 37: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, human and murine cells show a species-specific difference in the TLR2-dependent recognition of distinct LP structures (15Grabiec A. Meng G. Fichte S. Bessler W. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48004-48012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which seems to be linked to the chain length of the O-acylated fatty acids (16Buwitt-Beckmann U. Heine H. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Brock R. Ulmer A.J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6354-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Information on the structural factors determining the TLR2/TLR1 versus TLR2/TLR6 heteromer usage of a given ligand was obtained from experiments using cells of TLR2-, TLR6-, and TLR1-deficient mice. The diacylated MALP2 requires TLR2 and TLR6 for signaling, whereas the triacylated synthetic lipohexapeptide Pam3C-SK4 is able to induce activation of innate immune cells independently of TLR6 (17Alexopoulou L.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). These findings and additional investigations using various di- and triacylated LP finally led to the model according to which triacylated LP signal through TLR2/TLR1 heteromers, whereas diacylated LP signal through TLR2/TLR6 heteromers (2Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). However, we have found recently that not only triacylated LP, but also diacylated LP, like Pam2C-SK4 and the C-terminally elongated MALP2 derivative Pam2C-GNNDESNISFKEK-SK4 (MALP2-SK4), induce cell activation in a TLR6-independent manner. The absence of a long chain amide-bound fatty acid, therefore, is necessary but not sufficient to characterize a TLR2/6-dependent LP. The amino acid sequence of the peptide part of LP also takes part in the specificity of recognition by TLR2/TLR6 heteromers (21Buwitt-Beckmann U. Heine H. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Brock R. Akira S. Ulmer A.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). So far, for triacylated LP, no evidence for signaling through TLR2/TLR6 heteromers has been obtained, leading to the assumption that they signal through TLR2/TLR1 heteromers. However, the usage of TLR2/1 heteromers by LP has not been characterized thoroughly. We have now investigated in detail the structure-activity relationships of synthetic LP during signaling through TLR2/TLR1 and TLR2/TLR6 heteromers using cells from TLR1- and TLR6-deficient mice. For the interaction of LP, both the acyl residues as well as the N-terminal amino acid moiety of LP contribute to the specificity of recognition by TLR2/TLR1 and TLR2/TLR6 heteromers. For the first time, our investigations led to LP with ester-bound short chain length fatty acids, which do not induce signaling in TLR1-deficient mice. Interestingly, there are LP, which stimulate cells from TLR1- as well as TLR6-deficient mice, indicating that in native cells, TLR2 might be able to signal as homomers. Reagents—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, RPMI 1640, penicillin-streptomycin, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and Hepes buffer were obtained from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany). Fetal calf serum (Linaris, Wertheim-Bettingen, Germany) was heat-inactivated before use. LPS from Salmonella enterica serovar Friedenau was a kind gift from Prof. Dr. H. Brade (Department of Immunochemistry and Biochemical Microbiology, Research Center Borstel, Germany). This LPS preparation showed no TLR2-mediated activity. All synthetic LP were synthesized and analyzed by EMC microcollections GmbH (Tübingen, Germany). All synthetic LP used in this study are strictly TLR2-dependent as determined by the use of TLR2-deficient mice and HEK-TLR2 cells (data not shown). The chemical structures, denotations, names, and abbreviations of fatty acids and some synthetic LP analogs used in this study are summarized in Fig. 1. TLR1- and TLR6-deficient Mice—TLR1- and TLR6-deficient mice and the corresponding wild-type mice were F2 interbred from the 129/C57BL/6 F1 strain and had been generated by gene targeting as described previously (19Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Mühlradt P.F. Morr M. Radolf J.D. Zychlinsky A. Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 20Takeuchi O. Sato S. Horiuchi T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Dong Z. Modlin R.L. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Mice at the age of 8–12 weeks were killed after CO2 anesthesia, and single cell suspensions were prepared from spleen and bone marrow. All animal experiments were approved by the “Ministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Landwirtschaft, Schleswig Holstein.” Cell Culture—Polyclonal activation of B-lymphocytes from murine spleen cells was performed as described (22Ulmer A.J. Heine H. Feist W. Kusumoto S. Kusama T. Brade H. Schade U. Rietschel E.T. Flad H.D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3309-3314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 4 × 105 spleen cells/200 μl in 96-well flat bottom cell culture dishes were stimulated for a total culture time of 48 h and incubated with [3H]thymidine for the final 24 h of culture. BMDM were differentiated from bone marrow cells through incubation with 100 ng/ml human macrophage colony-stimulating factor as described elsewhere (23Reiling N. Holscher C. Fehrenbach A. Kröger S. Kirschning C.J. Goyert S. Ehlers S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3480-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). For stimulation with LP, BMDM were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/400 μl/well in 48-well cell culture dishes for 2 h and afterward stimulated with the indicated synthetic LP. After 18 h of culture, the concentration of IL-6 and/or tumor necrosis factor in the culture supernatants was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Cell Lysis and Western Blot Analysis—Lysates of BMDM were obtained by lysing the cells in 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) in 100 ml. The amounts of total protein were quantified using the Bio-Rad RC DC protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of protein (5 μg) were subjected for electrophoresis to NuPage Novex Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schüll, Dassel, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with Odyssey's blocking buffer (Li-Cor, Bad Homburg, Germany), and the blots were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human phospho-JNK (pJNK), polyclonal rabbit anti-pERK, or polyclonal rabbit anti-pp38. Monoclonal anti-p38 was used to control the protein load (all antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The membrane was developed with IR dye 800-labeled polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG (Li-Cor) or Alexa Fluor 680-labeled polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), respectively, for visualization of the MAP kinases and analyzed in an Odyssey infrared imager (Li-Cor). Statistics—The results are given in mean ± S.D. of three samples run in a given experiment. Each experiment has been repeated at least three times. One of these three experiments, giving representative results, is shown in each figure. TLR6- and TLR1-independent Diacylated LP—Recently, we have found that several diacylated lipopeptides including Pam2C-SK4 and MALP2-SK4 stimulate murine macrophages and B-lymphocytes in a TLR6-independent manner (21Buwitt-Beckmann U. Heine H. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Brock R. Akira S. Ulmer A.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Based on the assumption that TLR2 signals only as a heteromer in association with either TLR6 or TLR1, we hypothesized that these lipopeptides instead utilize TLR1 as the coreceptor and should therefore not activate cells derived from TLR1-deficient mice. To test this hypothesis, spleen cells from wild-type mice and TLR1- or TLR6-deficient mice were stimulated with these lipopeptides. Consistent with our previous observations, stimulation of spleen cells from wild-type mice and TLR6-deficient mice with Pam2C-SK4 and MALP2-SK4 resulted in proliferation of B-lymphocytes (Fig. 2). Control stimulation with MALP2 confirmed the unresponsiveness of TLR6-deficient cells to MALP2, whereas the response to Pam3C-SK4 was not affected by the absence of TLR6. However, surprisingly, stimulation of spleen cells of TLR1-deficient mice by Pam2C-SK4 and MALP2-SK4 also induced a strong proliferation of B-lymphocytes despite the lack of TLR1. MALP2 led to equal responses in both TLR1-containing as well as TLR1-deficient cells, whereas the response to Pam3C-SK4 was diminished to about 50% in TLR1-deficient B-lymphocytes (Fig. 2). Identification of Triacylated MALP2 Analogs That Are Neither TLR1- nor TLR6-dependent—The diacylated MALP2 analog was converted into a TLR6-independent ligand by elongation of the peptide moiety. Recently, it has been described that a tripalmitoylated MALP2 analog, in contrast to the dipalmitoylated MALP2, also induces signaling in a TLR6-independent manner (18Morr M. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Simon M.M. Mühlradt P.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3337-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Given the unexpected TLR1 independence of the diacylated MALP2-SK4 analog, we therefore intended to investigate whether attachment of the third acyl chain rendered this TLR6-independent ligand TLR1-dependent, in accordance with the original concept of coreceptor usage of LP. To investigate in detail the role of the chain length of the amide-bound fatty acid for the TLR6 independence of MALP2 analogs, MALP2 analogs with a third, amide-bound acyl moiety ranging from acetic acid up to palmitic acid were synthesized. When testing these MALP2 analogs using B-lymphocytes from wild-type mice and TLR6-deficient mice, we found that already the attachment of acetic acid resulted in a weak response of TLR6-deficient cells, although only at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 3). Elongation of the amide-bound fatty acid to up to 10 carbon atoms (decanoic acid) increased the stimulatory activity only slightly. All the MALP2 analogs with a short chain length of the amide-bound fatty acid were strongly TLR6-dependend at a concentration of 100 nm, which is sufficient to induce substantial signaling in B-lymphocytes of wild-type mice. However, stimulation of TLR6-deficient B-lymphocytes with MALP2 analogs having amide-bound fatty acids of 12, 14, or 16 carbon atoms at a concentration of 100 nm induced strong responses comparable with the response of 100 nm of MALP2 in wild-type cells (Fig. 3). This result underscores the influence of the amide-bound fatty acid of LP during recognition by TLR2/TLR6 heteromers. It is the current concept that LP are recognized either by TLR2/TLR6 or by TLR2/TLR1. To probe this concept, we also tested these MALP2 analogs in TLR1-deficient B-lymphocytes. Although triacylated MALP2 analogs are at least partially TLR6-independent, the stimulatory activity of these MALP2 analogs was comparable in TLR1-deficient and in wild-type cells (except for the N-decanoyl MALP2 analog exhibiting a somewhat reduced response in cells from TLR1-deficient mice) (Fig. 3). Therefore, we conclude that there are not only diacylated but also triacylated lipopeptides, which induce signaling in a TLR1- as well as TLR6-independent manner. The Chain Length of the Ester-bound Fatty Acids Determines the TLR1 Dependence of Signaling—Although Pam3C-SK4 is generally considered to signal through TLR2/TLR1 heteromers, this LP was also shown to have TLR1-independent properties (20Takeuchi O. Sato S. Horiuchi T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Dong Z. Modlin R.L. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). However, so far, no detailed analysis has been performed to determine the structural requirements for triacylated LPs to signal in a TLR1-independent or -dependent manner. Having shown that for the MALP2 analogs, the chain length of the amide-bound fatty acid has great influence on the coreceptor usage, we next decided to systematically vary the chain length of the ester-bound fatty acids of Pam3C-SK4. In the absence of ester-bound fatty acids, LP were unable to signal through TLR2 (data not shown). Stimulation of B-lymphocytes of wild-type mice with N-palmitoyl LP analogs carrying two ester-bound fatty acids with chain lengths of 6 (Hex) to 16 carbon atoms (Pam) confirmed that ester-bound long-chain fatty acids are necessary to induce considerable responses in these cells (Fig. 4). The LP analog PamHex2C-SSNASK4 exerted only low stimulatory activity and PamOct2C-SSNASK4 and PamPel2C-SSNASK4 have moderate bioactivity, whereas PamDec2C-SSNASK4 up to PamPam2C-SSNASK4 were strong stimulators of B-lymphocyte proliferation. When testing these LP analogs in TLR1-deficient B-lymphocytes, no responses of the cells were observed after stimulation with LP analogs, having short and moderate length (6 up to 10 carbon atoms), of the ester-bound fatty acids (Fig. 4). PamDod2C-SSNASK4, PamMyr2C-SSNASK4, and PamPam2C-SSNASK4 stimulated TLR1-deficient B-lymphocytes, but just as for Pam3C-SK4, the response was reduced by about 50% in comparison with the responses in wild-type cells. A similar structure-activity relationship of these LP analogs was found for stimulation of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor release in bone marrow-derived macrophages. No differences in the response of wild-type- and TLR6-deficient cells were observed after stimulation with these LP analogs (data not shown). For Triacylated LP, the Structure of Both the Peptide Moiety and the Ester-bound Fatty Acids Determines the TLR1 Dependence—Our previous results indicated that the engagement of TLR6 for signaling by LP is not only determined by the acylation pattern but also by the amino acid sequence of the peptide moiety (21Buwitt-Beckmann U. Heine H. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Brock R. Akira S. Ulmer A.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether a modification of the peptide sequence of our TLR1-dependent LP collection, as described above, resulted in a loss of TLR1 dependence. First, we synthesized a diacylated PamOct2C LP analog with the sequence SK4 instead of SSNASK4 of the peptide chain. Both PamOct2C-SK4 and PamOct2SSNASK4 stimulated wild-type cells equally well, and both analogs showed nearly no stimulation of TLR1-deficient B-lymphocytes (Fig. 5). Next, we compared a series of triacylated LP with an amide-bound Pam and ester-bound fatty acids of various chain lengths carrying peptide tails with the amino acid sequences SSNASK4 or SK3 or the (VPGVG)4VPGKG-NH2 peptide moieties. The latter 25-amino acid peptide is characterized by a high proportion of uncharged amino acids but has, nevertheless, a good solubility in water. All LP from these series showed a similar response pattern, independent of the amino acid sequence of the peptide tail. In particular, no response was detected in TLR1-deficient B-lymphocytes after stimulation with PamPel2C-(VPGVG)4VPGKG-NH2, PamOct2C-(VPGVG)4VPGKG-NH2, and PamDec2C-(VPGVG)4VPGKG-NH2 (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Stimulation of spleen cells from TLR1-deficient and wild-type mice with PamPel2C-lipopeptide analogs. Murine spleen cells were stimulated with MALP2 (100 nm) or with synthetic PamPel2C-lipopeptide analogs (1000 nm), and the [3H]TdR incorporation into B-lymphocytes was determined after 48 h of culture. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D., n = 3. A, a comparison of PamPel2C-SSNASK4 analogs with PamPel2C-SK3 analogs.

These differences on the level of coreceptor usage raised the question of whether the different LP analogs also activate different signaling pathways. Therefore, we investigated the phosphorylation of the MAP kinases, p38, Erk, and JnK, in BMDM, which are involved in TLR-mediated signaling (24Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6625) Google Scholar). For all four different LP analogs, all three MAP kinases were phosphorylated as early as 7.5 min after stimulation (Fig. 7). In contrast, 30 min after stimulation, nearly no phosphorylated MAP kinases were detected. Although there were some quantitative differences in the phosphorylation of the individual MAP kinases, there were no qualitative differences for the LP analogs. We also investigated whether one of these LP analogs may signal in a MyD88-independent manner. Consistent with the present knowledge on the MyD88 dependence of TLR2 signaling, p38 was not phosphorylated in BMDM of MyD88-deficient mice after stimulation with the LP analogs. In contrast, phosphorylation was detected after stimulation with LPS (Fig. 8).FIGURE 8Phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase induced by various TLR1- and/or TLR6-independent lipopeptide analogs in macrophages from wild-type and MyD88-deficient mice. BMDM from wild-type and MyD88-deficient mice were stimulated with MALP2, Pam3C-SK4, PamOct2C-SSNASK4, and Pam2C-SK4 at 100 nm and with LPS (10 ng/ml). After various culture times, cell lysates were fractionated using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for pp38. The levels of total p38 were used for normalization. C, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For TLR1- and TLR6-dependent LP, TLR2 Alone Is Not a Functional Recognition Molecule—PamOct2C-(VPGVG)4VPGKG-NH2 is a strong TLR2- and TLR1-dependent ligand, whereas MALP2 signals through TLR2 in a TLR6-dependent manner (19Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Mühlradt P.F. Morr M. Radolf J.D. Zychlinsky A. Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). In addition, Pam2C-SK4, which is a TLR1- and TLR6-independent ligand (21Buwitt-Beckmann U. Heine H. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Brock R. Akira S. Ulmer A.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), stimulates cells of TLR1- as well as TLR6-deficient mice. Given the fact that for many heteromeric receptors, each receptor unit contributes a binding site for the ligand, we tested whether PamOct2C-(VPGVG)4VPGKG-NH2 is able to interact with TLR2 in the absence of TLR1, which may lead to a blocking of the TLR2 receptor and subsequent inhibition of the activation of TLR1-deficient cells by MALP2 or Pam2C-SK4. BMDM from TLR1-deficient mice were first preincubated by PamOct2C-(VPGVG)4VPGKG-NH2 and then stimulated with MALP2 or Pam2C-SK4. Preincubation with a TLR2/TLR1 ligand had neither an inhibitory nor a synergistic effect on the activation of BMDM with MALP2 or Pam2C-SK4 (Fig. 9). Vice versa, TLR6-deficient BMDM were preincubated with MALP2 and then stimulated with PamOct2C-(VPGVG)4VPGKG-NH2 or Pam2C-SK4. Again, no inhibitory or synergistic effect was observed (Fig. 9). TLR2 is a prominent receptor of the innate immune system that recognizes a variety of different molecules from bacterial and non-bacterial origin. So far, TLR2 among all other TLRs has been considered to possess a unique characteristic. It has been assumed that this receptor does not signal as a homomer but only as a heteromer in collaboration with either TLR1 or TLR6 (25Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). The original concept, according to which triacylated LP recognize TLR2/TLR1 heteromers, whereas diacylated LP recognize TLR2/TLR6 heteromers, has recently been confronted by our finding that diacylated LP, like Pam2CSK4 and MALP2-SK4, are able to stimulate cells from TLR6-deficient cells (21Buwitt-Beckmann U. Heine H. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Brock R. Akira S. Ulmer A.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Given the availability of TLR1 knock-out mice, these results led us to investigate whether these compounds are instead TLR2/TLR1-dependent ligands. Surprisingly, however, we learned that Pam2C-SK4 and MALP2-SK4 have stimulatory activity in cells from both TLR6- and TLR1-deficient mice. The same was true for triacylated MAPL2 analogs. The tripalmitoylated MALP2 analog has been reported to signal through TLR2 in a TLR6-independent manner (18Morr M. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Simon M.M. Mühlradt P.F. Eur. J. Immun"
https://openalex.org/W2170801813,"Both the commitment event and the modality of cell death in photodynamic therapy (PDT) remain poorly defined. We report that PDT with endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associating hypericin leads to an immediate loss of SERCA2 protein levels, causing disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis and cell death. Protection of SERCA2 protein rescues ER-Ca2+ levels and prevents cell death, suggesting that SERCA2 photodestruction with consequent incapability of the ER to maintain intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is causal to cell killing. Apoptosis is rapidly initiated after ER-Ca2+ depletion and strictly requires the BAX/BAK gateway at the mitochondria. Bax-/-Bak-/- double-knockout (DKO) cells are protected from apoptosis but undergo autophagy-associated cell death as revealed by electron microscopy and biochemical analysis. Autophagy inhibitors, but not caspase antagonists, significantly reduce death of DKO cells, suggesting that sustained autophagy is lethal. Thus, following ER photodamage and consequent disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, BAX and BAK proteins model PDT-mediated cell killing, which is executed through apoptosis in their presence or via an autophagic pathway in their absence."
https://openalex.org/W2100016046,"HLA-G is a nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecule, which is expressed in trophoblasts and confers immunological tolerance in the maternal-fetal interface by binding to leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LILRs, also called as LIR/ILT/CD85) and CD8. HLA-G is expressed in disulfide-linked dimer form both in solution and at the cell surface. Interestingly, MHCI dimer formations have been involved in pathogenesis and T cell activation. The structure and receptor binding characteristics of MHCI dimers have never been evaluated. Here we performed binding studies showing that the HLA-G dimer exhibited higher overall affinity to LILRB1/2 than the monomer by significant avidity effects. Furthermore, the cell reporter assay demonstrated that the dimer formation remarkably enhanced the LILRB1-mediated signaling at the cellular level. We further determined the crystal structure of the wild-type dimer of HLA-G with the intermolecular Cys42-Cys42 disulfide bond. This dimer structure showed the oblique configuration to expose two LILR/CD8-binding sites upward from the membrane easily accessible for receptors, providing plausible 1:2 (HLA-G dimer:receptors) complex models. These results indicated that the HLA-G dimer conferred increased avidity in a proper structural orientation to induce efficient LILR signaling, resulting in the dominant immunosuppressive effects.

During pregnancy, the fetus can be the allogenic object for the maternal immune system, and thus a special system of immune tolerance is necessary for escaping from maternal immune surveillance to achieve a successful pregnancy. However, knowledge of the molecular mechanism of the maternal-fetal immune tolerance is still limited. In the maternal-fetal interface, the fetal extravillous cytotrophoblasts do not express major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHCIs), 5The abbreviations used are: MHCI, major histocompatibility complex class I molecules; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; LILR, leukocyte Ig-like receptor; β2m, β2-microglobulin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; NK, natural killer; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. HLA-A or -B, on the cell surface but do express minor classical MHCI, HLA-C, and nonclassical MHCIs, HLA-E and -G (1LeMaoult J. Le Discorde M. Rouas-Freiss N. Moreau P. Menier C. McCluskey J. Carosella E.D. Tissue Antigens. 2003; 62: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Toward T cells, the classical MHCIs present 8-10 amino acid peptides processed inside cells (e.g. proteasome) to induce peptide-specific T cell immune responses. Thus, the loss of HLA-A and -B expression significantly suppresses maternal T cell responses. Although HLA-C and -E are expressed in normal cells, the expression of HLA-G is restricted to a few tissues as follows: extravillous trophoblasts, thymus epithelial cells, and some tumors (1LeMaoult J. Le Discorde M. Rouas-Freiss N. Moreau P. Menier C. McCluskey J. Carosella E.D. Tissue Antigens. 2003; 62: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast with polymorphic classical MHCIs, HLA-G shows the limited polymorphism, suggesting that HLA-G may potentially have a role as a common ligand for generic immunosuppressive receptors in the protection of fetus cells from the maternal immune cells. Recently, several immunologically relevant cell-surface receptors were found to mediate the negative regulation of immune cells through binding to classical and nonclassical MHCIs. The receptors of HLA-G reported to date are CD8, leukocyte Ig-like receptor B1/B2 (LILRB1/LILRB2, also known as LIR1/LIR2, ILT2/ILT4, and Cd85j/Cd85d), and KIR2DL4. Although the molecular basis of the KIR2DL4-HLA-G interaction remains the subject of debate (1LeMaoult J. Le Discorde M. Rouas-Freiss N. Moreau P. Menier C. McCluskey J. Carosella E.D. Tissue Antigens. 2003; 62: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), LILRB1/2 and CD8-HLA-G recognitions have been studied (2Chapman T.L. Heikeman A.P. Bjorkman P.J.

LILRB1 is expressed in a wide range of leukocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, although LILRB2 is expressed in a restricted set of immune cells, including monocytes and dendritic cells (5Brown D. Trowsdale J. Allen R. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 64: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Both LILRBs have four Ig-like domains in the extracellular region, and the N-terminal two Ig-like domains are responsible for MHCI recognitions. Upon MHCI binding, LILRBs mediate the negative signal by three or four immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in the intracellular domain. The HLA-G molecule in the maternal-fetal interface recognizes LILRBs to inhibit immune response of a wide range of maternal immune cells, including myelomonocytic cells, T cells, and NK cells. On the other hand, HLA-G has several soluble forms as splice variants (6Le Bouteiller P. Legrand-Abravanel F. Solier C. Placenta. 2003; 24 (Suppl.

Sequencing studies of both overall eluted and purified peptides have shown that HLA-G can display limited but still diverse sets of peptides (12Lee N. Malacko A.R. Ishitani A. Chen M.C. Bajorath J.

This peptide presentation is more similar to that of classical MHCIs than that of nonclassical MHCI, HLA-E, which can present a very limited repertoire of peptides, including the MHCI signal sequence and heat shock and viral proteins. HLA-G shows the slow transport to the cell surface and the long half-life on the cell surface because of its truncated intracytoplasmic domain lacking an endocytosis motif (14Park B. Lee S. Kim E.

A. 2005; 102: 3360-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) also showed that the peptide recognition of HLA-G included an extensive network of contacts, supporting the constrained mode of the peptide binding. HLA-G has two free cysteine residues (Cys42 and Cys147) unlike most of other MHCIs. Boyson et al. (17Boyson J.E. Erskine R. Whitman M.C. Chiu M. Lau J.M. Koopman L.A. Valter M.M. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16180-16185Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) reported that the bacterial recombinant soluble form of HLA-G can form a disulfide-linked dimer with the intermolecular Cys42-Cys42 disulfide bond. Moreover, the soluble HLA-G1 expressed by human embryonic kidney 293 cells also showed the mixture of monomer, disulfide-linked dimer, and oligomer forms, which could reduce the CD8 expression level on cytotoxic T lymphocyte (9Morales P.J.

However, it is uncertain how much effect each form has. On the other hand, the membrane-bound form of HLA-G can also form a disulfide-linked dimer on the cell surface of the Jeg3 cell line, which endogenously expresses HLA-G (18Gonen-Gross T. Achdout H.

Erskine R. Whitman M.C. Chiu M. Lau J.M. Koopman L.A. Valter M.M. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mandelboim O. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis studies suggested that the HLA-G dimer was responsible for efficient LILRB1-mediated inhibition of the killing activity of NK cells (19Gonen-Gross T. Gazit R. Achdout H. Hanna J. Mizrahi S. Markel G. Horejsi V. Mandelboim O. Hum. Immunol. 2003; 64: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Gonen-Gross T. Achdout H. Gazit R. Hanna J. Mizrahi S. Markel G. GoldmanWohl D. Yagel S. Horejsi V. Levy O. Baniyash M. Mandelboim O. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, the β2m-free form of HLA-G also forms disulfidelinked dimers and multimers on the cell surface mainly by Cys42-mediated disulfide bonds, similar to the dimer form of normal β2m-associated HLA-G protein described above (18Gonen-Gross T. Achdout H. Arnon T.I. Gazit R. Stern N. Horejsi V. GoldmanWohl D. Yagel S. Mandelboim O. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4866-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The disulfide-linked homodimer was also observed in the β2m-free form of HLA-B27, which has a free cysteine (Cys67). Previous reports (21Kollnberger S. Bird L. Sun M.Y. Retiere C. Braud V.M. McMichael A. Bowness P. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Allen R.L. Raine T. Haude A. Trowsdale J. Wilson M.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5543-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) suggested that this homodimer would be directly associated with the development of ankylosing spondylitis, whereas others argued that the dimer formation may be part of multimers that exhibit significant function for signal transduction (23Colbert R.A. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Damjanovich S. Matyus L. Damjanovich L. Bene L. Jenei A. Matko J. Gaspar R. Szollosi J. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 82: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the significant level of the expression of the disulfide-linked β2m-free MHCI dimers was observed at the cell surface of activated but not resting normal T cells, suggesting that the MHCI dimers are important for regulating the activation of T cells (25Santos S.G. Powis S.J. Arosa F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53062-53070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our previous report (3Shiroishi M. Tsumoto K. Amano K. Shirakihara Y. Colonna M. Braud V.M. Allan D.S. Makadzange A. Rowland-Jones S. Willcox B. Jones E.Y. van Der Merwe P.A. Kumagai I. Maenaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8856-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) showed that LILRB1 and LILRB2 preferentially bound to the monomer form of HLA-G in comparison with the other classical MHCIs, and its binding site overlapped with that of CD8. Recently the crystal structure of the HLA-G C42S mutant monomer was reported (16Clements C.S. Kjer-Nielsen L. Kostenko L. Hoare H.L. Dunstone M.A. Moses E. Freed K. Brooks A.G. Rossjohn J. McCluskey J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3360-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), proposing the HLA-G dimer model. However, the three-dimensional structure and the receptor binding characteristics of the disulfide-linked wild-type HLA-G dimer have never been experimentally evaluated. Here we report the LILR binding and signaling studies, and we have determined the crystal structure of the HLA-G dimer. First, we performed LILRB1/2 binding studies of the monomer and dimer forms of HLA-G, clearly showing that both overall apparent affinities of the dimer are much higher than those of the monomer by the avidity effect. Next, the LILRB1 NFAT-GFP reporter cell assay (26Arase H. Mocarski E.S. Campbell A.E. Hill A.B. Lanier L.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1323-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 27Ohtsuka M. Arase H. Takeuchi A. Yamasaki S. Shiina R. Suenaga T. Sakurai D. Yokosuka T. Arase N. Iwashima M. Kitamura T. Moriya H. Saito T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8126-8131Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that the dimer formation remarkably augmented the LILRB1-mediated signaling. Furthermore, in order to reveal the structural basis for the high LILR affinity and efficient LILR signaling of the HLA-G dimer, we determined the crystal structure of the wild-type HLA-G, which formed a disulfide-linked dimer via the Cys42-Cys42 disulfide bond in the crystals. The structural orientation of the dimer was additionally stabilized by the extended interface interactions of loops between β-strands below the α1-helix, in the center where Cys42 was located. The HLA-G dimer exhibited the oblique configuration to expose two LILRB1/2- and CD8-binding sites upward from the membrane that is fully accessible for receptors, providing the plausible 1:2 (HLA-G dimer:receptors) complex model. These structural and functional results suggested that the HLA-G dimer conferred increased avidity in a proper structural orientation to show overall high affinity and efficient signaling to LILRB1/2 and probably CD8. We will further discuss the potential physiological roles of the HLA-G dimer in soluble and membrane-bound forms. Based on the present study of the HLA-G dimer, the structural and functional characteristics of the disulfidelinked β2m-free MHCI dimers, either of the pathogenic allele HLA-B27 or expressed on the activated T cells, will be also discussed. Production of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant ectodomains of the HLA-G monomer, LILRB1, and LILRB2 were produced according to our previous report (3Shiroishi M. Tsumoto K. Amano K. Shirakihara Y. Colonna M. Braud V.M. Allan D.S. Makadzange A. Rowland-Jones S. Willcox B. Jones E.Y. van Der Merwe P.A. Kumagai I. Maenaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8856-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The preparation of the biotinylated HLA-G monomer, LILRB1, and LILRB2 were essentially the same as for those without the tag. 6K. Kuroki, M. Shiroishi, D. Kohda, and K. Maenaka, unpublished data. Site-directed mutagenesis for the C42S mutant HLA-G monomer was performed by the two-step PCR method. The refolded monomer of wild-type HLA-G naturally formed the disulfidebonded dimer (10-30% of the total protein) for ∼20 days at 4 °C. For the binding studies, the HLA-G dimer was purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 10/30, Amersham Biosciences). Native Gel Electrophoresis—The native-PAGE for characterizing the protein samples and analyzing the binding was performed by the Phast system (Amersham Biosciences). We used the commercially available native-PAGE buffer strip (0.25 m Tris, 0.88 m l-alanine, pH 8.8; Amersham Biosciences), and the experiment was performed at 15 °C. In the complex formation experiments, the sample mixture was incubated at 20 °C for 1 h before applying to the homogeneous 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (Amersham Biosciences). Less than 4 μl of samples on each lane was applied. Equilibrium Gel Filtration Studies—The equilibrium gel filtration was performed on a SMART system with Superdex-200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. The column was equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20 (HBS-EP buffer) with 10 μm LILRB1 or 15 μm LILRB2. The mixtures of HLA-G dimer (10 μm for LILRB1 and 15 μm for LILRB2) and LILRB1/2 at molar ratios of 1:0 (dimer alone), 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 were incubated at room temperature for 1 h before injections. Surface Plasmon Resonance Studies—Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a BIAcore2000™ (BIAcore AB, St. Albans, UK) following the standard protocol of our previous report (3Shiroishi M. Tsumoto K. Amano K. Shirakihara Y. Colonna M. Braud V.M. Allan D.S. Makadzange A. Rowland-Jones S. Willcox B. Jones E.Y. van Der Merwe P.A. Kumagai I. Maenaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8856-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Briefly, the biotinylated LILRBs were immobilized on the research grade Sensor Chip CM5 (BIAcore AB) on which streptavidin was covalently immobilized. The HLA-G dimer or C42S mutant monomer flowed over at 50 μl/min. Kinetic constants were derived using the curve fitting for the bivalent analyte model or the simple 1:1 binding model by the BIAevaluation version 3.2 (BIAcore). For equilibrium binding analyses, the equilibrating binding response at each concentration of analyte was calculated by subtracting the response measured in the control flow cell from the response in the sample flow cells. Affinity constants (Kd) were calculated by nonlinear curve fitting or by Scatchard analysis with the simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model using the program Origin version 5.0 (Microcal). In the experiments of reverse orientation, the biotinylated HLA-Gs were immobilized. LILRBs flowed over the immobilized HLA-Gs. LILRB1 NFAT-GFP Reporter Cell Assay—The chimera molecule that consisted of the extracellular domain of LILRB1 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of activating PILRβ (28Shiratori I. Ogasawara K. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was transfected into a mouse T cell hybridoma carrying NFAT-green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene and DAP12 by using retrovirus vector (26Arase H. Mocarski E.S. Campbell A.E. Hill A.B. Lanier L.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1323-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 27Ohtsuka M. Arase H. Takeuchi A. Yamasaki S. Shiina R. Suenaga T.

The various concentrations (0-160 ng/ml) of HLA-G dimer and monomer were immobilized on the 48-well tissue culture plate (BD Falcon) at 37 °C for 2 h. The reporter cells expressing the LILRB1-PILR chimera molecule (5 × 104/well) were stimulated by immobilized HLA-G monomer or dimer for 12 h, and the expression of GFP was analyzed by FACSCalibur. Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The detailed description for crystallization of the disulfidelinked HLA-G dimer was published (51Shiroishi M. Kohda D. Maenaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 10.1016/j.bbapap.2005.10.006PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 μl of protein solution was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the crystallization reservoir solution. The crystals were obtained in the condition of Wizard II-39 (100 mm CHAPS, pH 10.5, 20% (w/v) PEG8000, 200 mm NaCl) at 20 °C. A 3.2-Å diffraction data set was collected at 100 K, at beamline BL38B1 of Spring8 (Harima, Japan) (l = 1.0000 Å). The diffraction data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 program package. The detail crystallographic statistics are shown in Table 1. The HLA-G structure was phased by the molecular replacement procedure using Molrep in CCP4 package (29Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) with the search probe, the crystal structure of the HLA-E-peptide complex (Protein Data Bank code 1MHE) (30O'Callaghan C.A. Tormo J. Willcox B.E. Braud V.M. Jakobsen B.K. Stuart D.I. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Two HLA-G monomers (chains A and B) were found by using the HLA-E model in the range 20 to 3.5 Å. After the rigid-body adjustment, one cycle of positional and overall B-factor refinement with the program Refmac5 (29Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), the Fo-Fc map clearly showed electron density for the disulfide bond between Cys42 of the crystallographic 2-fold monomer (Fig. 4B), indicating that two disulfide-bonded dimers existed in this crystal, and each monomer in each dimer complex was placed along the crystallographic 2-fold axis. Further refinement with the grouped (2 groups per residue) B-factor refinement was carried out with Refmac5 and CNS (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The final models include two HLA-G molecules (heavy chain, β2m and peptide) and show Rcryst 23.5% (Rfree = 29.8%) between 50 and 3.2 Å. Detailed crystallographic statistics are shown in Table 1. A Ramachandran plot of the backbone angles gave 85.3, 13.4, and 0.9% in most favored, additionally, and generously allowed regions, respectively, and 0.3% in the disallowed region. Ramachandran plot was calculated by PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

As in the previous report by Boyson et al. (17Boyson J.E. Erskine R. Whitman M.C. Chiu M. Lau J.M. Koopman L.A. Valter M.M. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16180-16185Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the C42S mutation kept HLA-G as the monomer form (hereafter designated as the HLA-G monomer or the monomer), clearly indicating that the HLA-G dimer was formed dominantly via the Cys42-Cys42 disulfide bond. The LILRB1 binding to the HLA-G monomer was observed on native-PAGE, but not all of the monomer formed the LILRB1 complex because of the low affinities (Kd ∼2-5 μm) as described in our previous report (3Shiroishi M. Tsumoto K. Amano K. Shirakihara Y. Colonna M. Braud V.M. Allan D.S. Makadzange A. Rowland-Jones S. Willcox B. Jones E.Y. van Der Merwe P.A. Kumagai I. Maenaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8856-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To determine the stoichiometry of the complex between LILRB1 and HLA-G dimer, a series of the mixture (1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 (HLA-G dimer:LILRB1)) was analyzed on native-PAGE (Fig. 1D). It showed that the full complex was composed of one HLA-G dimer and two LILRB1s (1:2 complex). On the other hand, the LILRB2 binding study by native-PAGE (Fig. 1F) demonstrated that the LILRB2 bound to the dimer but with very low affinity. To determine the binding stoichiometry unambiguously, equilibrium gel filtration was performed (Fig. 1, E and G). When protein concentrations in the running solution are above the dissociation constant, the elution profile will depend on the stoichiometry of the injected mixture and the true equilibrium stoichiometry of the complex. The stoichiometry of the HLA-G dimer-LILRB1 and -LILRB2 complexes was determined by applying samples, including either 1:0, 1:1, 1:2, or 1:3 (HLA-G dimer:LILRB1) molar ratios over a column equilibrated with 10 μm LILRB1 or 15 μm LILRB2. The injection of the 1:0 and 1:1 (HLA-G dimer:LILRB) showed a peak corresponding the dimer-LILRB complex and a trough where the free LILRBs migrated, indicating that the LILRBs of the running solution were consumed for the complex formation. On the other hand, the 1:3 molar ratio sample for both LILRBs generated two peaks corresponding to the HLA-G dimer-LILRB complex and the free LILRB, indicating the presence of excess free LILRBs. The 1:2 molar ratio sample showed only one complex peak and thus represented the true equilibrium complex stoichiometry. The 1:2 binding stoichiometry for LILRB1/2 reasonably conferred the avidity effect, which was observed in the later section of the surface plasmon resonance analysis and can be accounted for by the LILRB1 complex model structure of the HLA-G dimer (Fig. 6B). High Affinity LILRB Binding of HLA-G Dimer—The binding of the HLA-G dimer to LILRBs was further characterized by surface plasmon resonance. The HLA-G dimer and monomer were injected over sensor surfaces on which biotinylated LILRBs had been immobilized. Representative data for binding of HLA-G monomer and dimer to LILRBs were shown in Fig. 2. The monomer showed 1:1 binding with very fast dissociation rates (3.5-5 s-1) (Fig. 2, B and D). Affinity constants (Kd) of the monomer for LILRB1 and LILRB2 were 3.5 and 15 μm, respectively, derived from equilibrium analysis (Fig. 2E), which were similar to those from the opposite orientation studies of the HLA-G monomer (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1) (3Shiroishi M. Tsumoto K. Amano K. Shirakihara Y. Colonna M. Braud V.M. Allan D.S. Makadzange A. Rowland-Jones S. Willcox B."

https://openalex.org/W2032981041,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met signaling is thought to be a key pathway in both melanocyte development and melanoma metastasis. Here, HGF stimulation of melanocytes was seen to up-regulate c-Met expression. In an effort to decipher the mechanism by which HGF up-regulates its receptor, we found that c-Met is a direct transcriptional target of Mitf. This was confirmed with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments of the human c-Met promoter, as well as by the ability of adenovirally expressed Mitf to modulate endogenous c-Met protein levels in melanocytes. Disruption of Mitf blocked HGF-dependent increases in endogenous c-Met message and protein levels, indicating that HGF regulates its own receptor levels via Mitf. Finally, dominant-negative inhibition of Mitf resulted in profound resistance of melanocytes and melanoma cells to HGF-dependent matrix invasion, suggesting a physiologic role for this pathway in melanocytic development and melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2056501566,"Protein kinase C (PKC) delta is an essential regulator of mitochondrial dependent apoptosis in epithelial cells. We have used the PKCdelta(-/-) mouse to ask if loss of PKCdelta protects salivary glands against gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis in vivo and to explore the mechanism underlying protection from apoptosis. We show that gamma-irradiation in vivo results in a robust induction of apoptosis in the parotid glands of wild type mice, whereas apoptosis is suppressed by greater than 60% in the parotid glands of PKCdelta(-/-) mice. Primary parotid cells from PKCdelta(-/-) mice are defective in mitochondrial dependent apoptosis as indicated by suppression of etoposide-induced cytochrome c release, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and caspase-3 activation. Notably, apoptotic responsiveness can be restored by re-introduction of PKCdelta by adenoviral transduction. Etoposide and gamma-irradiation-induced activation of p53 is similar in primary parotid cells and parotid glands from PKCdelta(+/+) and PKCdelta(-/-) mice, indicating that PKCdelta functions downstream of the DNA damage response. In contrast, activation of the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase is reduced in primary parotid cells from PKCdelta(-/-) cells and in parotid C5 cells, which express a dominant inhibitory mutant of PKCdelta. Similarly, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase activation is suppressed in vivo in gamma-irradiated parotid glands from PKCdelta(-/-) mice. These studies indicate an essential role for PKCdelta downstream of the p53 response and upstream of the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase activation in DNA damage-induced apoptosis in vivo and in vitro."

Academic Press, London2003: 125-139Crossref Google Scholar). By contrast, PFL does not oxidize pyruvate, but uses a radical-based homolytic mechanism (2Wagner A.F. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schäfer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), yielding 1 mol of formate and 1 mol of acetyl-CoA per mol of pyruvate. Both PFO and PFL are oxygen-sensitive enzymes. The evolutionary origins of such enzymes for the anaerobic lifestyle in eukaryotes remains heavily debated. Either (i) the eukaryote common ancestor was a strict aerobe and anaerobic biochemistry in eukaryotes was acquired secondarily via lateral gene transfer (3Andersson S.G. Kurland C.G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 4Dyall S.D. Yan W.H. Delgadillo-Correa M.G. Lunceford A. Loo J.A. Clarke C.F. Johnson P.J. Nature. 2004; 431: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or (ii) it was a facultative anaerobe, with its descendant lineages having undergone specialization and differential loss (5Martin W. Müller M. Nature. 1998; 392: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 6Tielens A.G. Rotte C. van Hellemond J.J. Martin W. Trends Biochem.

PFL plays a central role in anaerobic glucose fermentation of a number of obligatory or facultative anaerobic bacteria. The Escherichia coli PFL system has been investigated in detail. Following the shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, pfl transcription is induced 12–15-fold (9Sawers G. Bock A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5330-5336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Knappe J. Sawers G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 6: 383-398PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PFL protein levels increase by about 5–10-fold (11Pecher A. Blaschkowski H.P. Knappe K. Bock A. Arch. Microbiol. 1982; 132: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PFL is converted post-translationally from an inactive to a catalytically active form by a 20-kDa iron-sulfur protein called pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme (PFL-AE). PFL-AE introduces a radical on the ultimate glycine residue of the PFL, in an S-adenosyl-l-methionine- and flavodoxin-dependent reaction (12Broderick J.B. Henshaw T.F. Cheek J. Wojtuszewski K. Smith S.R. Trojan M.R. McGhan R.M. Kopf A. Kibbey M. Broderick W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The radical-containing protein is extremely sensitive to oxygen: exposure of activated E. coli PFL to air results into its cleavage in two polypeptides of ∼82 and 3 kDa (2Wagner A.F. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schäfer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 13Zhang W. Wong K.K. Magliozzo R.S. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4123-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fragmentation of activated PFL by oxygen has also been reported in the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis (14Asanuma N. Iwamoto M. Hino T. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and in the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis (15Melchiorsen C.R. Jokumsen K.V. Villadsen J. Johnsen M.G. Israelsen H. Arnau J. . 2000; 182: 4783-4788Google Scholar). Oxygenolytic cleavage of PFL appears to be a drastic means to inactivate an enzyme that would produce less energy than its aerobic counterpart, pyruvate dehydrogenase. Some bacteria possess a mechanism for the reversible deactivation of PFL. In E. coli, PFL deactivase activity is harbored by the bifunctional enzyme aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHE), which catalyzes the sequential conversion of acetyl-CoA (a product of PFL activity) into acetaldehyde and ethanol. Quenching of the radical present on activated PFL by ADHE (16Kessler D. Herth W. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18073-18079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Asanuma N. Yoshii T. Hino T. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) occurs via a yet unknown mechanism. However, ADHE does not always exhibit the PFL deactivase activity, as shown in L. lactis (15Melchiorsen C.R. Jokumsen K.V. Villadsen J. Johnsen M.G. Israelsen H. Arnau J. . 2000; 182: 4783-4788Google Scholar). Reports on eukaryote PFL are limited to a few anaerobic protists and some green algae. PFL activity has hitherto been measured in two amitochondriate eukaryotes, the chytridomycetes Neocallimastix sp. L2 and Piromyces sp. E2 (18Akhmanova A. Voncken F.G. Hosea K.M. Harhangi H. Keltjens J.T. op den Camp H.J. Vogels G.D. Hackstein J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In these anaerobic fungi, PFL was localized to the hydrogenosomes (18Akhmanova A. Voncken F.G. Hosea K.M. Harhangi H. Keltjens J.T. op den Camp H.J. Vogels G.D. Hackstein J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which are anaerobic, hydrogen-producing mitochondria (8Boxma B. de Graaf R.M. van der Staay G.W. van Alen T.A. Ricard G. Gabaldon T. van Hoek A.H. Moon-van der Staay S.Y. Koopman W.J. van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Friedrich T. Veenhuis M. Huynen M.A. Hackstein J.H. Nature. 2005; 434: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Upon a shift to dark anaerobic conditions, a few unicellular photosynthetic algae such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella fusca ferment their starch into formate, ethanol, and acetate in a molar ratio of 2:1:1, whereas the production of H2 and CO2 remains low (19Kreuzberg K. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 87-94Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The pattern of fermentation end products together with the sensitivity of formate production to oxygen were interpreted as the presence of a PFL-like protein in the algae (19Kreuzberg K. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 87-94Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Kreuzberg K. Klöch G. Großheiser D. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 69: 481-488Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Neither PFL activity nor PFL genes have been reported in animals or plants. Here we report the expression and compartmentalization of the PFL system (ADHE, PFL, and PFL-AE) in C. reinhardtii with mass spectrometry, immunological, and molecular techniques. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry on the soluble fraction of isolated mitochondria, backed by the available C. reinhardtii genome sequence, we report the occurrence of a phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (PTA-ACK) pathway, which is yet undescribed but, as we show, apparently not unique among eukaryote genomes investigated to date. Strains and Culture Conditions—C. reinhardtii wild-type strain 11.32a and cell wall-less strain 83.82 (collection of algae Göttingen) were maintained on Tris acetate phosphate (TAP) medium (21Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar) solidified with 1.5% (w/v) agar. TAP medium and TAP medium supplemented with 34 mm acetate, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH (H3 medium), were used for liquid cultures. For anaerobic cultures, cells were transferred into a Falcon tube that was introduced in a jar containing Anaerocult® A (Merck). Anaerobiosis was typically achieved within 30 min. The jar was placed on a rotary shaker, under light or dark conditions. Following incubation under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions at 22 °C, the algal cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min and immediately frozen. XL1-Blue MRF' E. coli strain (Stratagene) was grown anaerobically on LB medium in the presence of 0.4% (w/v) glucose and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. Library Screening for C. reinhardtii cDNAs—Specific probes for C. reinhardtii ADHE, PFL, and PFL-AE were obtained by amplification reactions, using as template a cDNA library in λZAPII phagemid (Stratagene) made with mRNAs isolated from cells grown in light with 5% CO2. The primers used were: ADHE, 5′-GCCACCCCCCATGCTGAGGTG-3′ and 5′-GTTGATCTTGGAGAAGAACTC-3′; PFL, 5′-GACGCGGGCATCAACGTCCAG-3′ and 5′CATGGTGTCGTGGAAGGTGCG-3′; PFL-AE, 5′-GTTTTCGGAAACGTGCATTCA-3′; and 5′-CTCGGCGCAGATGACGGGAAC-3′. The resultant PCR products were cloned in pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and sequenced. Specific probes were non-radioactively labeled using a DNA-digoxigenin labeling kit (Roche), and used to screen the same cDNA library. Isolated cDNAs were excised from the λ phages and retrieved in pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene). Protein Overexpression and Antibody Production—A partial sequence of C. reinhardtii PFL cDNA (coding for Leu236–Val677; tPFL) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers containing the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined) as follows: 5′-GACGGATCCCTGTACAGCACGGTGCGC-3′, and 5′-GTCAAGCTTCACCCACTCGGCGATCTCGTC-3′. The PCR product was cloned in pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and recloned in the BamHI/HindIII sites of the overexpression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). Following the same strategy, the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the atypical C-terminal extension (Val496–Lys574) of subunit β of C. reinhardtii mitochondrial ATPase (22Franzén L.G. Falk G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression vector pET15b (Novagen). The primers used were: 5′-GAATTCCATATGGTGGAGAAGGCCGACAAGCTG-3′, and 5′-ATGCTGCTCGAGTTACTTCTTGGGCAGGGGCAC-3′. The resultant constructs were introduced into XL1 Blue MRF' or BL21 E. coli strains to produce the recombinant proteins. His-tagged proteins were purified under denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA matrix (Qiagen), as recommended by the supplier. Antibodies against tPFL were produced at Eurogentec (Leuven, Belgium), and antibodies against the C-terminal extension of subunit βF1-ATPase were produced at Charles River Laboratories. RNA Blot Analysis—Total RNA from C. reinhardtii cells was isolated with NucleoSpin® RNAII (Macherey-Nagel) and transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences). RNA was analyzed by gel blot hybridization in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured sheared herring sperm DNA, and 50% (v/v) formamide, at 42 °C. Following hybridization, membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS at 48 °C, followed by 2 washes in 0.2× SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, at 48 °C. The PFL probe was a 450-bp amplified PCR fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1571–2031 of the isolated PFL cDNA, PFL-AE probe was a 550-bp fragment released after PstI digestion of PFL-AE cDNA, and ADHE probe was a 1.5-kb fragment (corresponding to the 5′-end of the open reading frame) released after digestion of ADHE cDNA with SacI. Probes were purified with QIAquick gel extraction columns (Qiagen) and labeled with [32-P]dCTP by random priming. Isolation of C. reinhardtii Chloroplasts and Mitochondria—Cell wall-less C. reinhardtii cells were grown on TAP medium to late exponential phase, harvested at 2,000 × g in a GSA rotor (Sorvall) for 8 min, and resuspended in breaking buffer (0.25 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris, 50 mm Mes, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 m m MnCl2, 2 m m EDTA, pH 7.2, KOH). Cell suspension was passed through a cell disruptor (BioNeb, Glas-Col, Terre Haute, IN) with N2 gas pressure at 20 p.s.i. Cell lysate was centrifuged shortly to 5,000 rpm in a GSA rotor (Sorvall). The pellet was used to prepare intact chloroplasts (23Bollivar D.W. Beale S.I. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mitochondria, in the supernatant, were pelleted at 11,000 rpm for 10 min in SS34 rotor (Sorvall) and further purified on Percoll gradient (24Eriksson M. Gadeström P. Samuelsson G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in 50 mm dithiothreitol and 50 mm Na2CO3. For protein concentration determination, an aliquot of cells was precipitated with 80% (v/v) acetone and resuspended in 0.4% (w/v) SDS. Protein content was determined using the BCA Assay reagent kit (Pierce). For protein gels, cells were solubilized in 2% (w/v) SDS and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 90 °C, for 2 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% acrylamide (w/v) gel and subsequently transferred onto Hybond C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for immunodetection. Blots were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies as follows: 1:5000 for anti-C. reinhardtii PFL (this work), 1:20000 for anti-C. reinhardtii βF1-ATPase (this work), and 1:50000 for anti-C. reinhardtii LHC proteins (Dr. O. Vallon, IBPC, France). Immunodetection was carried out using the BM chemiluminescent protein blot kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To reprobe the blots, the Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce) was used. TMBZ/H2O2 method was used (25Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) for in-gel cytochrome detection. Dual color precision plus protein standards (Bio-Rad) and the Benchmark™ pre-stained protein ladder (Invitrogen) were used to estimate molecular mass. Mass Spectrometry and Protein Identification—Mitochondria were resuspended in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, in the presence of 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm ϵ-amino caproic acid to a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml and sonicated 4 times for 10 s. Soluble and membrane components were fractionated by ultracentrifugation. The soluble fraction was run on a 12% (w/v) acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Gel pieces were excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel and subjected to tryptic digestion (26Ferro M. Salvi D. Rivière-Rolland H. Vermat T. Seigneurin-Berny D. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11487-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Samples were injected into a nanoLC system directly coupled to a QTOF Ultima mass spectrometer (Waters). MS and MS/MS data were acquired and processed automatically using Masslynx 4.0 software. Data base searching was performed with Mascot 2.0, using NCBInr, the JGI C. reinhardtii version 2.0 gene models and EST databases. Proteins identified with at least 2 peptides showing scores higher than 40 were validated automatically. Peptides with scores between 18 and 40 were checked manually to confirm or cancel Mascot suggestion. Sequence Analysis—Expressed sequence tag (EST) clones of C. reinhardtii were obtained from the EST databases. A draft of the Chlamydomonas genome is available. Sequence alignments were done with ClustalW 1.82 and refined manually. Motif search was done using the Prosite Data base of the protein family and domains. Predictions for intracellular targeting were performed using Predotar version 1.03, TargetP version 1.01, and PSORT. Networks—Homologues were retrieved by BLAST searches against sequenced genomes and the nonredundant protein data base at GenBank®. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Gapped positions were excluded from phylogenetic analysis. A protein LogDet distance matrix (28Lockhart P.J. Steel M.A. Hendy M.D. Penny D. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 605-612PubMed Google Scholar) for each alignment was calculated with LDDist (29Thollesson M. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 416-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Splits were determined by Neighbor-Net (30Bryant D. Moulton V. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), a variant of the Neighbor-Joining algorithm (31Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), and plotted as planar graphs with Splitstree (32Huson D.H. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). For calculating the LogDet distances among ACK sequences, amino acids were recorded as Dayhoff classes, yielding six possible character states instead of 20 (7Hrdy I. Hirt R.P. Dolezal P. Bardonova L. Foster P.G. Tachezy J. Embley T.M. Nature. 2004; 432: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii Expresses PFL, PFL-AE, and ADHE—A mass spectrometry proteomics survey of highly purified Chlamydomonas mitochondria revealed numerous peptides matching PFL data base entries (see below). Searching the C. reinhardtii EST databases identified a number of clones for PFL along with homologues for its radical-activating (PFL-AE) and putative deactivating (ADHE) enzymes. These ESTs were used to produce specific DNA probes and to isolate full-length cDNAs for the proteins of interest. The sequence of the longest PFL cDNA clone (3379 bp) contains an open reading frame of 2559 bp coding for a putative protein of 852 amino acids. The inferred PFL amino acid sequence shares extensive similarity with glycyl radical enzymes, an emerging class of anaerobic enzymes. These enzymes use a radical chemistry for carbon-carbon bond formation or cleavage (33Raynaud C. Sarcabal P. Meynial-Salles I. Croux C. Soucaille P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5010-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 34Lehtiö L. Goldman A. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 35Himo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1707: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows sequence alignment of predicted C. reinhardtii PFL with different members of the larger PFL family (34Lehtiö L. Goldman A. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The highest sequence identity with prokaryote enzymes was found with the well characterized PFL of E. coli (56%), whereas the identity with other members of the family of PFL-related enzymes was significantly lower: 21% with the glycerol dehydratase from Clostridium butyricum and only 11% with benzylsuccinate synthase from Thauera aromatica. C. reinhardtii PFL exhibits the two adjacent cysteinyl residues (Fig. 1A, Cys513–Cys514), which are present in all PFLs shown to catalyze homolytic pyruvate cleavage (2Wagner A.F. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schäfer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). As compared with bacterial PFLs, C. reinhardtii PFL exhibits a long N-terminal extension (Fig. 1A), suggestive of organelle targeting. This extension contains many Met residues, and computer-based subcellular localization predictions vary according to the assumed intiation Met.FIGURE 1A, alignment of C. reinhardtii PFL with known and predicted glycyl radical enzymes. Identical residues are shaded black, conservative replacements are shaded gray. At its N terminus, C. reinhardtii PFL exhibits eight Met residues (italics), of which the third and the fourth (underlined) are the most likely to be the initiation Met based on translation context (47Silflow C.D. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 25-40Google Scholar).

The predicted protein exhibits a radical activating enzyme signature (Prosite PS01087) (Fig. 1B), characteristic of all radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes (36Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The highest identity was found with PFL-AE homologues (35% identity with E. coli), whereas the activating enzymes of C. butyricum glycerol dehydratase and T. aromatica benzylsuccinate synthase were more distantly related (23 and 18% identity, respectively). C. reinhardtii PFL-AE exhibits a long N-terminal extension (Fig. 1B) that is predicted to serve as a chloroplast targeting peptide by PSORT, Predotar, and TargetP. The isolated C. reinhardtii ADHE cDNA (3804 bp) has an open reading frame of 2865 bp encoding a precursor protein of 954 amino acids, sharing 62% identity with ADHE from the cyanobacterium Thermosynecchococcus elongatus (Q8DM94). Conservation with eukaryote enzymes is to some extent lower with 49% identity with Piromyces sp. ADHE (Q6WJD5) and 53% identity with ADHE of its nonphotosynthetic counterpart Polytomella sp. (Q70YJ9) (37Atteia A. van Lis R. Mendoza-Hernández G. Henze K. Martin W. Riveros-Rosas H. González-Halphen D. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 53: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii ADHE has a long N-terminal extension predicted to target the protein to the mitochondrion. Effect of Anaerobiosis and Darkness on ADHE, PFL, and PFL-AE mRNA Levels—Kreuzberg (19Kreuzberg K. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 87-94Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported that formate production in C. reinhardtii increased during the first hours of anaerobiosis, reaching its highest levels after 6 h. Accordingly, transcript levels for ADHE, PFL, and PFL-AE in cells exposed to aerobiosis and to 6 h of anaerobiosis were compared by RNA blot analysis. PFL transcripts were hardly detectable in cells grown in aerated cultures (Fig. 2). Oxygen removal increased PFL mRNA levels, which were highest in cells kept in darkness (Fig. 2). PFL-AE transcripts were low in cells grown in aerated cultures and were not significantly influenced by anaerobiosis, in contrast to PFL transcripts (Fig. 2). No ADHE mRNAs could be detected in the RNA samples used to follow PFL and PFL-AE transcripts (not shown). Effect of Anaerobiosis and Darkness on PFL Levels—Truncated C. reinhardtii PFL protein (tPFL; Leu236–Val677 of the precursor protein) was expressed in E. coli and used for antibody production. The produced antibody recognized C. reinhardtii PFL as a protein of ∼78 kDa as well as PFL from E. coli and Neocallimastix frontalis (supplemental Fig. I). Protein blots were carried out to determine the effect of 6 h of anaerobiosis on PFL levels. As revealed by immunoblotting, no significant changes in PFL levels occurred under anaerobiosis in either light or dark conditions (Fig. 3A). The antiserum detected a single band of ∼78 kDa in protein extracts from light-exposed cells (with or without oxygen), but detected two bands of close molecular mass in protein extracts from cells maintained in anaerobiosis in the dark. The effects of prolonged darkness or anaerobiosis on PFL accumulation were also investigated. TAP-growing cells were harvested in their exponential growth phase, resuspended in fresh culture medium, and incubated for 24 h in the conditions of interest. The medium for resuspension was either TAP medium (TAP) or a TAP-derived medium that contains 3-fold more acetate (H3). Cells were then harvested and prepared for protein analysis. Protein blots showed the presence of PFL in all cells analyzed, although two forms of close Mr were observed. The larger form of ∼78 kDa was found in cells from aerated cultures, regardless of the amount of acetate or the illumination, whereas the smaller form of ∼75 kDa was detected in cells kept under anaerobic conditions, in continuous darkness or continuous light (Fig. 3B). PFL levels appeared to be slightly lower in cells grown on H3 medium relative to the cells grown on TAP medium (Fig. 3B). Further work will determine whether acetate influences PFL steady-state levels in the algae growing under aerobic conditions. Intracellular Localization of PFL in C. reinhardtii—PFL localization protein was investigated by protein blot analysis. TAP-grown C. reinhardtii cells were harvested, and disrupted by nebulization.

Alternatively, as a result of its unusual conformational plasticity, α-synuclein may fold into an amphipathic helix upon contact with a lipid-water interface. Using spin label ESR and fluorescence spectroscopy, we show here that α-synuclein affects the lipid packing in small unilamellar vesicles. The ESR hyperfine splittings of spin-labeled phospholipid probes revealed that α-synuclein induces chain ordering at carbon 14 of the acyl chains below the chain melting phase transition temperature but not in the liquid crystalline state of electroneutral vesicle membranes. Binding of α-synuclein leads to an increase in the temperature and cooperativity of the phase transition according to the fluorescence anisotropy of the hydrophobic polyene 1,6-diphenylhexatriene and of the fluorescence emission maxima of the amphiphilic probe 6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene. Binding parameters were obtained from the fluorescence anisotropy measurements in combination with our previous determinations by titration calorimetry (Nuscher, B., Kamp, F., Mehnert, T., Odoy, S., Haass, C., Kahle, P. J., and Beyer, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 21966–21975). We also show that α-synuclein interacts with vesicle membranes containing sphingomyelin and cholesterol. We propose that the protein is capable of annealing defects in curved vesicle membranes, which may prevent synaptic vesicles from premature fusion."

The asteroid 617 Patroclus is the only known binary Trojan1. The orbit of this double system was hitherto unknown. Here we report that the components, separated by 680 km, move around the system's centre of mass, describing a roughly circular orbit. Using this orbital information, combined with thermal measurements to estimate the size of the components, we derive a very low density of .

https://openalex.org/W2058631304,"The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, maintains a persistent infection altering the proteins expressed on the surface of the infected red blood cells, thus avoiding the host immune response. The primary surface antigen, a protein called PfEMP1, is encoded by a multicopy gene family called var. Each individual parasite only expresses a single var gene at a time, maintaining all other members of the family in a transcriptionally silent state. Previous work using reporter genes in transiently transfected plasmid constructs implicated a conserved intron found in all var genes in the silencing process. Here we have utilized episomal recombination within stably transformed parasites to generate different var promoter and intron arrangements and show that loss of the intron results in var promoter activation. Further, in multicopy plasmid concatamers, each intron could only silence a single promoter, suggesting a one-to-one pairing requirement for silencing. Transcriptionally active, “unpaired” promoters remained active after integration into a chromosome; however, they were not recognized by the pathway that maintains mutually exclusive var gene expression. The data indicate that intron/promoter pairing is responsible for silencing each individual var gene and that disruption of silencing of one gene does not affect the transcriptional activity of neighboring var promoters. This suggests that silencing is regulated at the level of individual genes rather than by assembly of silent chromatin throughout a chromosomal region, thus providing a possible explanation of how a var gene can be maintained in a silent state while the immediately adjacent var gene is transcriptionally active.

Malaria caused by the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum continues to place a heavy health and economic burden on the developing world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (1Snow R.W. Guerra C.A. Noor A.M. Myint H.Y. Hay S.I. Nature. 2005; 434: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). P. falciparum parasites infect the circulating red blood cells of their human hosts, modifying the red blood cell membrane and placing the parasite-encoded protein PfEMP1 on the cell surface. This makes infected cells cytoadherent, resulting in the sequestration of the parasites within the deep vascular beds and resulting in disruption of circulation within such organs as the brain and placenta. The syndromes of cerebral malaria and placental malaria are thought to be a direct consequence of this process (2Miller L.H. Good M.F. Milon G. Science. 1994; 264: 1878-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).PfEMP1 is encoded by the multicopy var gene family (3Baruch D.I. Pasloske B.L. Singh H.B. Bi X. Ma X.C. Feldman M.

Benatar C. Pouvelle B. Gysin J. Lanzer M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5418-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). By switching which gene is expressed, parasites alter both the cytoadherent properties of the infected cells and their antigenic phenotype, thus avoiding the antibody response of the infected individual and maintaining a persistent infection. This process of var gene expression switching and antigenic variation is dependent on strict control of var gene transcription, such that only a single gene is active at a time. Silencing of the remaining members of the family is therefore imperative for parasite survival.Recent work has shed some light on the process of var gene regulation. Changes in var gene expression are not accompanied by alterations in the sequence of the genes or in their position in the genome (8Scherf A. Hernandez-Rivas R. Buffet P. Bottius E. Benatar C. Pouvelle B. Gysin J. Lanzer M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5418-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and activation or silencing of specific genes is unlikely to result from changes in the presence or absence of specific transcription factors (9Deitsch K.W. del Pinal A. Wellems T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 101: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Changes in the transcriptional status of individual var genes have, however, been linked to alterations in chromatin structure and subnuclear localization, implicating an epigenetic mechanism for var gene regulation (10Duraisingh M.T.

This silencing was shown to be S-phase-dependent, a characteristic typical of silencing that is the result of alterations in chromatin structure (15Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J.

In the context of a transiently transfected episome, the ability of the intron to function as a silencer requires its own independent promoter activity, giving rise to sterile transcripts that initiate within the central region of the intron (13Calderwood M.S.

These lines were generated using constructs that contain only the transcriptional activities found in var promoters and introns, thus maintaining as closely as possible the natural architecture of an intact var gene. Further, by taking advantage of intramolecular recombination events within episomally replicating multicopy concatamers, we were able to analyze how different arrangements of var promoters and introns influence expression. Recombination events that deleted an intron from the concatamer led to high levels of expression from the resulting “free” var promoter, thus confirming the role of the intron in var promoter silencing. In large concatamers, an equal number of var promoters and introns always resulted in complete silencing; however, concatamers in which var promoters outnumbered introns always displayed high levels of promoter activity, regardless of whether the concatamer was episomal or integrated into the chromosome. These assays indicate that there is a strict one-to-one pairing requirement between var promoters and introns for var promoter silencing to occur and that each intron can silence only a single var promoter. Parasites containing a chromosomally integrated active “unpaired” var promoter were also assayed for expression of the rest of the var gene family. Expression of this var promoter appears to have no effect on expression of the endogenous var genes within the genome, indicating that it is not “counted” within the allelic exclusion pathway that maintains mutually exclusive var gene expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReporter Constructs—The plasmid pVLH/IDH was described previously (Fig. 1) (13Calderwood M.S. Gannoun-Zaki L. Wellems T.E. Deitsch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34125-34132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This reporter construct carries two reporter cassettes, the first utilizing a var promoter driving expression of a firefly luciferase gene and the second using the promoter activity of a var intron to drive expression of the human dihydrofolate reductase (hdhfr)-selectable marker. Both cassettes use the hrp2 3′-UTR 2The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; CT, cycle threshold; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase. to terminate the expressed mRNA and ensure efficient protein expression.Parasite Culture and Transfection—P. falciparum parasites were cultivated at 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium, 0.5% albumax II (Invitrogen), 0.25% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin. Parasites were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 90% nitrogen. Reporter constructs were transfected into the NF54 parasite line by using “DNA-loaded” red blood cells as described previously (17Deitsch K.W. Driskill C.L. Wellems T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2-cm electroporation cuvettes were loaded with 0.175 ml of erythrocytes and 50 μg of plasmid DNA in incomplete cytomix solution. For stable transfection, NF54 parasites were cultured in media containing 40 ng/ml pyrimethamine. Plasmid rescue experiments were performed by transforming Escherichia coli-competent cells with 100 ng of purified P. falciparum genomic DNA.After obtaining stable transformants of the NF54 P. falciparum strain clonal cultures were generated by limiting dilution using 96-well microtiter plates (18Kirkman L.A. Su X.Z. Wellems T.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As a control for endogenous var gene switching, we also generated clonal cultures of wild type NF54 parasites. Media changes were performed at 7, 14, 21, 25, and 30 days. Plates were supplemented with 200 μl of red blood cells each on day 14. Individual plates were screened for parasites during media changes on days 21, 25, and 30. This gave rise to the clones D10, E4, G6, and E5. To select for chromosomal integration, the clonal parasite lines were cycled on and off drug pressure and recloned by limiting dilution resulting in the parasite lines D10/integrated, E4/integrated, E5/integrated, and G6/integrated. Plasmid rescue experiments were employed before and after drug cycling to quantitate episomal load of each parasite line. Individual parasite cultures were grown up to 20-ml cultures, synchronized, and used for determination of luciferase activity as well as for DNA and RNA extraction. The cell line D10/retransformed was obtained by retransfecting a rescued episome from the D10 parasite line into the wild type NF54 parasites.Luciferase Assays—Parasites were synchronized by the Percoll-sorbitol method (13Calderwood M.S. Gannoun-Zaki L. Wellems T.E. Deitsch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34125-34132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Howard R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Schizonts were isolated from 20-ml cultures using a 70%/40% Percoll-sorbitol gradient and subsequently inoculated into a 20-ml culture at 5% hematocrit. Parasites were allowed to reinvade overnight, and luciferase activity was measured at ∼12–14 h post-invasion. Synchronization was confirmed by light microscopy. In our hands this procedure yielded almost 100% pure ring stage parasites. Parasitemias were counted for 1000 red blood cells. Parasites were obtained from 200 μl of culture by centrifugation and subsequent lysis in 100 μl of Glo Lysis Buffer®. 100 μl of Bright-Glo® luciferase reagent system was added to the lysate. Luciferase activity was measured immediately in a TD-20/20 luminometer. Luciferase activity was expressed per 1% ring stage parasitemia. The luciferase activity of each clonal cell line was determined in at least three independent experiments.Southern Blots and Diagnostic PCR—Analysis of the rearrangements of both episomal and integrated constructs was performed using Southern blots and diagnostic PCR. Southern blots were performed according to established protocols (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989: 9.31-9.57Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA isolated from recombinant parasites was digested to completion by restriction enzymes and subjected to gel electrophoresis using 1% agarose in Tris/boric acid/EDTA buffer. The DNA was transferred to high-bond nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action after alkaline denaturation. DNA detection was performed using the Amersham Biosciences nonradioactive detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocols.The primers luciferase forward (LF) (5′-GCTGGGCGTTAATCAGAGAG-3′) and vector reverse (VR) (5′-ATTAATGCAGCTGGCACGAC-3′) were used to amplify the 1330-bp fragment that resulted from deletion of the intron. The same primers amplify a 3281-bp fragment from the intact pVLH/IDH plasmid. The primer pairs DHFR forward (DF) (5′-GAATCACCCAGGCCATCTTA-3′) and DHFR reverse (DR) (5′-GTGGAGGTTC CTTGAGTTCT CT-3′) were used to amplify the 1826-bp fragment from concatemers carrying the “double intron” recombination product.Identification of Integration Sites—Chromosomal integration was verified by generating PCR fragments spanning the integration sites. For integration at the intron of var gene PFB 1055c (subtelomeric region on chromosome 2) primers PFB1055c F1 (5′-GGGAAAACAACACCCATCAT-3′) and PFB1055c F2 (5′-AATTGCTGTTGTAAATGATCAAGA-3′) and DHFR reverse (DR) (5′-GTGGAGGTTC CTTGAGTTCT CT-3′) were used. For integration into the 3′-UTR of the hrp2 locus (subtelomeric region of chromosome 8) the primer HRP 1 (5′-GATGCTCATCACGCTCACC-3′) and DHFR reverse were used.All PCR reactions were carried out on a PTC-2000® Peltier thermal cycler using Taq polymerase® (Invitrogen) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35–38 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 40 s, 68 °C for 3 min, and a final extension step of 68 °C for 10 min. Reaction products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and automated sequencing.Genomic DNA Extraction—Infected red blood cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm. After the supernatant was discarded, the pellet was divided into two microcentrifuge tubes followed by resuspension in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 20 μl 10% saponin. Parasites were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with 1000 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. This process was repeated twice. The parasite pellet was then taken up in 200 μl of Tris/sodium chloride/EDTA buffer to which 40 μl of 10% SDS and 20 μl of 6 m NaClO4 were added. This suspension was placed on a rocker overnight and was phenol/chloroform-extracted the next morning. The final aqueous phase was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 10 μl of sterile distilled H2O. Final DNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Yields ranged from 100 ng/μlto1 μg/μl depending on parasitemia and stage of parasites.RNA Extraction and Real-time RT-PCR for Assaying Expression of the var Gene Family—RNA was extracted from synchronized ring stage parasites 12–14 h post-invasion. RNA extraction was performed with the TRIzol LS Reagent® as described previously (21Kyes S. Pinches R. Newbold C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). RNA to be used for cDNA synthesis was treated with Deoxyribonuclease I® (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. A total of 1600 ng of RNA was digested in a 20-μl reaction. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min followed by 10 min of heat inactivation at 65 °C. cDNA synthesis was performed with Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase® (Invitrogen) with random primers (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized from 800 ng of RNA in a 40-μl reaction. For each cDNA synthesis reaction, a control reaction without reverse transcriptase was performed with identical amounts of template. Transcription of the var gene family was quantified using the primer set published by Salanti et al. (22Salanti A. Staalsoe T. Lavstsen T. Jensen A.T.R. Sowa M.P.K. Arnot D.E. Hviid L. Theander T.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). With this primer set 150-bp fragments of exon I of each individual var gene present in the 3D7/NF54 P. falciparum strain are generated. To compare expression levels of the endogenous genes with the luciferase reporter gene, the primer pair luciferase forward (LF) (see above) and luciferase reverse (LR) (5′-GTGTTCGTCTTCGTCCCAGT-3′) were designed using primer 3 software. Amplification efficiency was verified by testing all primer pairs using a 3-log range of concentrations of genomic DNA obtained from transformed parasites. var gene transcription was expressed relative to the expression of a housekeeping gene (ΔCT method). All reactions included the three control genes published by Salanti et al.: seryl-tRNA synthetase (PF07_0073), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (PF14_0425), and actin (PFL2215w). However, an additional two control genes were also included: arginyl-tRNA synthetase (PFL0900c), using (5′-AAGAGATGCATGTTGGTC-3′) and (5′-GTACCCCAATCACCTACA-3′); and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (PF13_0170), using (5′-GGCACTTCAAGGGTACCT-3′) and (5′-TAATATAGCCTCACAAGC-3′).Reactions were performed at a final primer concentration of 0.5 μm using Bio-Rad ITAQ Sybr Supermix® in 20-μl reactions on an ABI Prism® 7900HT real-time PCR machine. The ΔCT for each individual primer pair was determined by subtracting the CT value from the CT value of the control the seryl-tRNA synthetase (Applied Biosystems, User Bulletin 2). ΔCTs were then converted to relative copy numbers with the formula 2ΔCt.Quantitation of Intron/Promoter Copies by Real-time PCR—To quantify the relative amounts of introns and promoters in the different cell lines, primer pairs specific to the promoter and intron of the pVLH/IDH plasmid were designed.The primer pair promoter forward (PF) (5′-ATTTTGAGTGTAACCAAGCGTAT-3′) and promoter reverse (PR) (5′-TCCACACAAAAACATAAACCTCA-3′) and the primer pair intron forward (IF) (5′-GGGGGATCCATTGCTTTTT-3′) and intron reverse (IR) (5′-AAATCACATACATATACACAAACACTT-3′) were used to amplify 150-bp fragments of the promoter and intron, respectively. The first 5 G residues in primer IF belong to the multicloning site of the original plasmid and ensure that the primer pair will only amplify the original plasmid intron. The promoter contained in pVLH/IDH was originally obtained from the Dd2 parasite line (9Deitsch K.W. del Pinal A. Wellems T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 101: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and is not present in the NF54 genome. Both primer pairs showed identical amplification profiles across 3 logs of DNA template dilutions. Real-time PCR conditions were the same as used for the expression analysis of the var gene family. Relative DNA copy numbers were determined using the ΔCT method.RESULTSStable Transformation of Parasites with the Plasmid pVLH/IDH Results in Either an Active or a Silent Phenotype—To investigate var promoter regulation on stably replicating rather than transiently transfected plasmids, it is necessary that the constructs also contain a selectable marker cassette. Typically this involves the placement of a constitutively active promoter driving a drug resistance gene onto the plasmid, thus allowing drug selection of transformed parasites (23Wu Y. Sifri C.D. Lei H.-H. Su X. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 24Wu Y. Kirkman L. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1130-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 25Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7289-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, previously it was shown that the ability of a var intron to silence an associated var promoter is dependent on the independent promoter activity of the intron itself (13Calderwood M.S. Gannoun-Zaki L. Wellems T.E. Deitsch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34125-34132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), indicating that some sort of interaction, possibly promoter competition or interference, is responsible for the silencing effect. To avoid the potentially confounding effects of placing an additional transcriptionally active promoter next to the var promoter, we instead used the promoter activity of the intron itself to drive expression of the human dhfr gene. In the construct pVLH/IDH (Fig. 1), a var promoter is used to drive expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. However, the presence of a var intron on the plasmid effectively silences the var promoter, and thus parasites transiently transfected with this construct are silent with respect to luciferase expression (13Calderwood M.S. Gannoun-Zaki L. Wellems T.E. Deitsch K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34125-34132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Cultured parasites were transfected with this construct and placed under selection with the antimalarial drug pyrimethamine. After approximately 3 weeks of drug pressure, stably transformed parasites were detectable in the culture, and plasmid rescue experiments demonstrated that they were indeed carrying episomes. Parasites were then cloned by limiting dilution to assess whether clonal parasite cultures exhibited the silent phenotype observed in transient transfection experiments. Surprisingly, about half of these new clones exhibited an active phenotype with very high levels of luciferase expression, whereas the remainder of the clones exhibited the expected silent phenotype. This indicated that ∼50% of the stably transformed parasites had activated the var promoter in the construct and were expressing luciferase. Fig. 1B shows the levels of luciferase expression from four representative clones demonstrating the active and silent phenotypes.Uneven Recombination within Episomal Concatamers Results in Deletion of the Intron from Some Expression Cassettes—Transformation with the silent pVLH/IDH plasmid generated both active and silent parasite clones in approximately equal proportions. Previous reports have suggested that switches in var gene expression occur at a rate of 0.1–2% per generation (26Roberts D.J. Craig A.G. Berendt A.R. Pinches R. Nash G. Marsh K. Newbold C.I. Nature. 1992; 357: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 27Horrocks P. Pinches R. Christodoulou Z. Kyes S. Newbold C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11129-11134Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). If var promoter activation in our transformants had occurred at this rate, only a small fraction of the parasite population should have exhibited the active phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that var promoter activation in the clonal parasite lines was unlikely to be due to “switching” but most likely was secondary to a recombination event that resulted in var promoter activation.Within parasites, plasmids are thought to multiply into head-to-tail concatamers of 9–15 copies, with the size of the concatemer maintained through an ill-defined recombination-dependent mechanism (28O'Donnell R.A.

The pVLH/IDH plasmid carries a duplicated 3′-hrp2 terminator sequence following both the luciferase and hdhfr coding sequences. We hypothesized that homologous recombination between these two sequences generated two new episome species (Fig. 2), one that deleted the intron from the VLH/IDH cassette and the other one carrying a cassette with a double intron. Because the intron was previously shown to be required for silencing, this recombination event could have resulted in var promoter activation. PCR reactions using diagnostic primer pairs designed to specifically detect these two new species of plasmids confirmed their existence within genomic DNA extracted from the transformed parasites (Fig. 3B). In accordance with our hypothesis, all parasites that exhibited the active phenotype had deleted an intron from the original VLH/IDH cassette and contained a free var promoter. Interestingly, the parasite line E5 contained both products of the recombination event, and in these parasites the luciferase gene was silent. This suggested that in this parasite line the arrangement of promoters and introns had changed, whereas their numbers remained equal.FIGURE 2Model of recombinational unpairing of var promoter and var intron during episomal replication. During episomal replication multimers are formed by rolling circle replication, and the size of the concatamer is maintained through intramolecular homologous recombination. The original pVLH/IDH plasmid carries a duplicated hrp2 3′-UTR sequence. Homologous recombination between these two sequences can result in two new plasmid species. In one species the intron is deleted from the VLH/IDH expression cassette, whereas in the other the cassette now has an additional (double) intron. PCR with the primers luciferase forward (LF) and vector reverse (VR) amplify a 1330-bp fragment from the cassette that deleted its intron or a 3281-bp fragment from the original VLH/IDH cassette. The primers DHFR forward (DF) and DHFR reverse (DR) amplify a 1826-bp fragment only from the cassette that carries the double intron.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Detection of episomal recombination in transfected parasites.

We previously reported elevations in hepatic Class 1 alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) expression in ethanol-fed rats correspondent with reduced levels of mature, nuclear sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), an insulin-induced transcriptional repressor of the ADH gene. In this report, we have studied the effects of insulin and ethanol on ADH gene expression in a highly differentiated rat hepatoma cell line (FGC-4), as well as the in vivo effects of chronic intake of an ethanol-containing diet on hepatic insulin signaling. Insulin inhibited ADH gene expression, and this was abolished by LY294002 (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) and small interfering RNA knockdown of SREBP-1. Chronic ethanol intake led to decreased phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B) at Thr308, increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, and decreased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (a downstream effector of Akt). Hepatic membrane-associated Akt content was decreased and cytosolic Akt content was increased in rats fed an ethanol-containing diet. Thus, disruptive effects of ethanol on insulin signaling occurred via impaired phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308. TRB3, a negative regulator of Akt, was induced in liver of ethanol-fed rats. In ethanol-treated FGC-4 cells, small interfering RNA knockdown of TRB3 increased membrane-associated Akt and the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308. Our results suggest that ethanol induces TRB3, which, through binding to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt, prevents its plasma membrane association, Akt-Thr308 phosphorylation, and subsequent Akt-mediated signaling. Ethanol inhibition of insulin signaling reduces nuclear SREBP accumulation and results in disinhibition of Class 1 ADH transcription.

Writings from as early as the 17th century, as well as modern epidemiological studies, suggest that chronic and excessive alcohol consumption is positively associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes (1Kao W.H.

Com. 2000; 274: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as a consequence of cyclic expression of the major alcohol metabolizing enzyme, hepatic Class 1 alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Further studies from our laboratory demonstrated that alcohol induces hepatic ADH gene transcription via decreased levels of nuclear SREBP-1c protein, a negative regulator of the ADH gene (9He L.

SREBP-1c is encoded by an insulin-responsive gene (10Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin.

These observations led to the current hypothesis under study, namely that ethanol may suppress nuclear SREBP-1c via disruption of insulin signaling, which may be a potential link between alcohol consumption and insulin resistance. In this study, we elucidate the mechanism by which chronic ethanol intake inhibits insulin action and identify TRB3, a previously identified modulator of Akt signaling, as a primary ethanol-responsive modifier of insulin signaling (12Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies were purchased from commercial suppliers: SREBP-1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); GSK3, and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); phospho-GSK3, Akt, phospho-Akt473, phospho-Akt308, phospho-PTEN, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), p85, and p110α were from Cell Signaling, Inc.

Rictor antibody was from Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Montgomery, TX).Animal Experimental Protocols—Experiments conformed to ethical guidelines for animal research and received prior approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Industries (Indianapolis, IN). An intragastric cannula was surgically implanted into each animal, and they were allowed to recover and were fed by total enteral nutrition. In this total enteral nutrition model, rats are infused with an ethanol-containing diet (13 g/kg/day) using a computer-driven programmable pump that supplies diet continuously, except for 1 h each day needed to refill the syringes, as described previously (13Badger T.M. Ronis M.J. Lumpkin C.K. Valentine C.R. Shahare M. Irby D. Huang J. Mercado C. Thomas P. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 438-447PubMed Google Scholar). The control rats were infused the same diet except that ethanol was isocalorically replaced with carbohydrate. We used urine ethanol concentrations (UECs) to track blood ethanol concentrations since ethanol equilibrates with body water and we have previously demonstrated that UECs accurately reflect blood ethanol concentrations (36Badger T.M. Crouch J. Irby D. Hakkak R. Shahare M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 938-943PubMed Google Scholar).

The actual time of sacrifice occurred while diets were being infused to avoid any changes in insulin levels associated with stopping the diet infusions. Liver was collected and stored at -70 °C. Type 2 diabetic rat livers were from a previously reported study (15Sawant S.P. Dnyanmote A.V. Shankar K. Limaye P.B. Latendresse J.R. Mehendale H.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Briefly, Sprague-Dawley rats (100 g) were fed a high fat diet for 14 days and then treated with low dose (45 mg/kg) streptozotocin. Type 2 diabetes was confirmed by hyperglycemia, normoinsulinemia, and oral glucose tolerance testing (15Sawant S.P. Dnyanmote A.V. Shankar K. Limaye P.B. Latendresse J.R. Mehendale H.M. J. Pharmacol.

Rat TRB3 probe was generated using the following primers: 5′-TTGCGTCGATTTGTCTTCAG-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-CTCCCTCAACCAGGGATGTA-3′ (3′-primer). 18 S ribosomal RNA antisense oligonucleotide was synthesized (Bio Synthesis, Inc., Lewisville, TX). All filters were probed with the 18 S rRNA oligonucleotide as an internal control. Bands were quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiogram, and the ratio of ADH message to 18 S rRNA in the same sample was determined and expressed as relative RNA units or as percentage of that for the control.Preparation of Rat Liver Extracts, Crude Plasma Membrane Fractions, Cytosolic Fractions, Nuclear Extracts, and Measurement of Akt Activity—Crude plasma membrane fractions and cytosolic fractions were prepared from liver tissue homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer using a previously described procedure (16Park J.

Akt activity was measured by using an Akt kinase assay kit from Cell Signaling.Western Immunoblot Analysis—Samples with equal amounts of protein determined by the Bradford protein assay were resolved on polyacrylamide gels. One was transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and the other was stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm equal sample loading. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline with Tween plus 5% (w/v) milk powder with gentle shaking and were then incubated with different primary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline with Tween. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence plus system (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences) following incubation with secondary antibodies. Detection by autoradiography was as described previously (9He L. Simmen F.A. Ronis M.J. Badger T.M. J. Biol.

The plasmid expression cassettes were sequenced to confirm identity.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Confocal Microscopy—Rat hepatoma FGC-4 cells (obtained from Mary C. Weiss, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) were seeded in medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 5% fetal bovine serum). For transfection, FGC-4 cells at 60% confluence were incubated for 6 h with plasmid/Lipofectamine 2000 mixture following the manufacturer's protocol. Subcellular localization of GFP-tagged Akt was studied in cells cultured in Flaskette chamber slides sealed with a gasket (Nunc International, Naperville, IL) after treatment with insulin and/or ethanol and followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and examination with a Zeiss LSM410 laser scanning confocal microscope. For experiments with ethanol treatment, cells were cultured in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate and 5% fetal bovine serum; all caps were tightly closed for the remainder of the experiment to prevent the evaporative loss of ethanol.RNA Interference and Co-immunoprecipitation—Double-stranded stealth RNA duplexes (Invitrogen) corresponding to rat TRB3 (165–189 bp, NM_144755) coding region (5′-ATCTCTGGCTGCTTCTGCCGATGTT-3′) were transfected into FGC-4 cells. SREBP-1 siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The effect of RNA interference was measured after 48 h of incubation. The negative control siRNA was used in control transfections (Ambion). For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were transfected with pEGFP-Akt expression vectors or the pEGFP-N1 control vector by Lipofectamine 2000 for 24 h; total cell lysates were obtained and incubated with antiserum to GFP and protein G slurry overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected, washed, and separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) followed by Western blotting using TRB3 antiserum.Statistics—The Student's t test was used to determine whether group means differed at a significance level of p < 0.05.RESULTSEffects of Chronic Ethanol Intake on UECs—UECs did not reach a steady-state level, although the ethanol-containing diet was infused continuously for more than 3 weeks (data not shown). Rather, UECs fluctuated in the form of large regular “pulses” such that concentrations varied between a nadir of near zero to peak levels of greater than 500 mg/dl over a 6-day period, similar to our previous observations (8Badger T.M. Hoog J.O. Svensson S. McGehee R.E. Fang C. Ronis M.J.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 2000; 274: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mean blood and urine alcohol concentrations were greater than 300 mg/dl at the time of sacrifice (data not shown); hepatic nSREBP-1 protein was reduced by more than 50%, and hepatic Class I ADH was induced by greater than 2-fold, results nearly identical to those previously reported (9He L. Simmen F.A. Ronis M.J. Badger T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28113-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Serum insulin concentrations did not differ significantly between control and ethanol-fed rats (1.00 ± 0.11 versus 0.85 ± 0.10 ng/ml, respectively).Effects of Ethanol and Insulin on Class 1 ADH mRNA in Hepatoma FGC4 Cells and Livers of Type 2 Diabetic Rats—The effects of ethanol and insulin on ADH mRNA expression were studied in highly differentiated rat hepatoma FGC-4 cells. Fig. 1A presents a Northern blot of FGC-4 cells treated with various doses of insulin (0.1–10 nm) in the presence or absence of ethanol (50 mm). The data demonstrate that ethanol induced and insulin reduced ADH mRNA abundance in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05), an effect that was completely abolished by 50 mm ethanol, confirming that insulin inhibits in vitro ADH expression. Insulin treatment increased nuclear SREBP-1c protein expression (p < 0.05), and ethanol treatment not only prevented the insulin induction of nSREBP-1 but reduced (p < 0.05) it to levels below the control (Fig. 1C). These data are consistent with the model that insulin regulates ADH via changes in nSREBP-1c (9He L. Simmen F.A. Ronis M.J. Badger T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28113-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 not only blocked the insulin inhibition of ADH gene expression but also induced ADH mRNA expression more that 2-fold over control (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that insulin inhibits ADH gene expression through the PI3K pathway. When SREBP-1 was knocked down by specific siRNA, insulin-inhibition of ADH gene expression was negated, and ADH mRNA was significantly increased (Fig. 2B). This evidence confirmed our previous report that SREBP-1 is a repressor of ADH gene expression (9He L. Simmen F.A. Ronis M.J. Badger T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28113-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The above data indicate that insulin inhibits ADH gene expression through PI3K and SREBP-1.FIGURE 2ADH mRNA levels in treated FGC-4 cells and in type 2 diabetic rats.

These results are consistent with the elevated ADH activity reported in diabetic male rats (18Crabb D.W. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1986; 10: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Effects of Ethanol on the Phosphorylation of GSK3, Akt, and Proximal Insulin Signaling in Rat Liver—We examined GSK3 because it inhibits SREBP-1c transcriptional activity (19Kim K.H.

Lukiyanchuk V. Jin J. Harper J.W. Ericsson J. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Insulin has been reported to inhibit GSK3 as a result of phosphorylation. Western blot analyses were performed on liver whole cell lysates from rats fed an ethanol-containing diet and that were killed when blood ethanol concentrations were greater than 300 mg/dl. Although no ethanol-induced changes were observed in total GSK3 levels, p-GSK3β levels were lower (p < 0.05) in the hepatic whole cell lysates of ethanol-fed rats (Fig. 3, A and B). Ethanol did not affect total Akt protein abundance (Fig. 3A), but Akt phosphorylation of Thr308 (p-Akt-Thr308) was inhibited by ethanol (p < 0.05), and Akt phosphorylation of Ser473 (p-Akt-Ser473) was increased (p < 0.05) relative to control animals (Fig. 3, A and B). Decreased (p < 0.05) hepatic Akt activity was observed in ethanol-treated animals as compared with control (0.48 ± 0.11 versus 1 ± 0.12 arbitrary densitometric units (ADU)). Notably, the alcohol-induced decreases in levels of phospho-GSK3β, p-Akt-Thr308, and Akt activity coincided with reduced hepatic nuclear SREBP-1 protein content and increased ADH activity as reported previously (9He L. Simmen F.A. Ronis M.J. Badger T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28113-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, these results are consistent with a role for both Akt and GSK3 in alcohol induction of ADH through SREBP-1.FIGURE 3Ethanol effects on the levels of GSK3 and Akt proteins in whole cell lysates of rat liver.

In agreement with a previous report demonstrating that ethanol treatment increased PI3K activity in rat liver (6Onishi Y. Honda M. Ogihara T. Sakoda H. Anai M. Fujishiro M. Ono H. Shojima N.

Cellular distribution of Rictor abundance was assessed and found to be a membrane-enriched protein (Fig. 4B). There were no statistically significant differences in hepatic phospho-PTEN (1.00 ± 0.017 versus 0.99 ± 0.012 ADU) or PTEN (1.00 ± 0.041 versus 1.095 ± 0.041 ADU) between control and ethanol-fed rats, respectively.FIGURE 4Ethanol effects on the levels of PDK1, p110α, p85, and Rictor proteins in whole cell lysates and membrane fractions of rat hepatic tissues.

Translocation of Akt from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and binding to phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3) are crucial for the phosphorylation on Thr308 by membrane-located PDK1 (21Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Ther. 2002; 93: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the subcellular location of Akt in response to ethanol consumption. Ethanol reduced (p < 0.05) membrane-localized Akt (Fig. 5A), in agreement with the observed ethanol suppression of p-Akt-Thr308 (Fig. 3A), whereas ethanol increased (p < 0.05) the amount of Akt in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that ethanol prevents association of Akt with the plasma membrane-bound PIP3, a prerequisite for PDK1 phosphorylation of Akt-Thr308.FIGURE 5Hepatic Akt and TRB3 in cytosolic and plasma membrane fractions of rats fed ethanol-containing diet. A shows Western blots of Akt in hepatic plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions prepared from control rats (no ethanol) and ethanol-fed rats (n = 6 rats/group). Also shown is a Western blot of TRB3 in the cytosolic fractions. Each lane represents a sample from an individual rat. B depicts the densitometric analysis of the above Western blots (means ± S.E.).

Upon insulin stimulation, a significant portion of GFP-Akt was distributed to the plasma membrane, whereas ethanol abolished the insulin-stimulated GFP-Akt membrane localization (Fig. 6A). To confirm these results, plasma membrane fractions were examined for GFP-Akt protein in Western blot analysis. As can be seen in Fig. 6, B and C, insulin-stimulated cells had five times greater levels of GFP-Akt (p < 0.05), and this was blocked by ethanol treatment. It is note-worthy that there are 3 amino acid residues that differ between our cloned Akt2 cDNA from Sprague-Dawley rats (GenBank number DQ198085) and Akt2 previously cloned from Rattus norvegicus, but these 3 amino acid residues are identical to mouse Akt2 at the corresponding positions.FIGURE 6Ethanol disrupt"

Its bacterial homologue SufS is stimulated by SufE. Here we characterize the Arabidopsis chloroplast protein CpSufE, which has an N-terminal SufE-like domain and a C-terminal BolA-like domain unique to higher plants. CpSufE is targeted to the chloroplast stroma, indicated by green fluorescent protein localization and immunoblot experiments. Like CpNifS, CpSufE is expressed in all major tissues, with higher expression in green parts. Its expression is light-dependent and regulated at the mRNA level. The addition of purified recombinant CpSufE increased the Vmax for the cysteine desulfurase activity of CpNifS over 40-fold and decreased the KM toward cysteine from 0.1 to 0.043 mm. In contrast, CpSufE addition decreased the affinity of CpNifS for selenocysteine, as indicated by an increase in the KM from 2.9 to 4.17 mm, and decreased the Vmax for selenocysteine lyase activity by 30%. CpSufE forms dynamic complexes with CpNifS, indicated by gel filtration, native PAGE, and affinity chromatography experiments. A mutant of CpSufE in which the single cysteine was changed to serine was not active in stimulating CpNifS, although it did compete with WT CpSufE. The iron-sulfur cluster reconstitution activity of the CpNifS-CpSufE complex toward apoferredoxin was 20-fold higher than that of CpNifS alone. We conclude that CpNifS and CpSufE together form a cysteine desulfurase required for iron-sulfur cluster formation in chloroplasts.

We conclude that CpNifS and CpSufE together form a cysteine desulfurase required for iron-sulfur cluster formation in chloroplasts. Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster proteins perform a variety of biological roles in electron transfer, catalysis, gene regulation, and sensing of iron and oxygen (1Beinert H. Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Iron-sulfur cluster proteins are particularly important to photosynthesis. Measurements of metal ions in Arabidopsis thaliana have indicated that about 70% of the iron in green tissue is present in chloroplasts, and 40% is found in the thylakoids (2Shikanai T. Müller-Moulé P. Munekage Y. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Estimates in other plants indicate that up to 90% of the iron in leaves may be present in the chloroplasts (3Terry N. Abadia J. J. Plant Nutr. 1986; 9: 609-646Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Within the thylakoids, the majority of the iron is found in Fe-S cluster proteins that function in photosynthetic electron transport (4Raven J.A. Evans M.C. Korb R.E. Photosynthesis Res. 1999; 60: 111-149Crossref Google Scholar). Next to photosynthetic carbon fixation, other pivotal plastid functions that require Fe-S clusters include nitrogen assimilation, sulfur assimilation, and pigment synthesis (for a review, see Ref. 5Balk J. Lobreaux S. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Whereas all plastid types contain a number of important Fe-S cluster proteins, especially the green chloroplasts need to synthesize and maintain a variety of Fe-S proteins with at least five different cluster types (5Balk J. Lobreaux S. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In bacteria, three separate Fe-S formation machineries have been characterized (for a review, see Ref. 6Johnson D. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). All systems include an NifS-like Cys desulfurase protein, which catalyzes the conversion of cysteine to alanine and elemental sulfur or the conversion of selenocysteine (SeCys) 2The abbreviations used are: SeCys, selenocysteine; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IDA, iminodiacetic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. to alanine and elemental selenium. Every Fe-S machinery also has scaffold proteins thought to function in the preassembly of clusters before transfer to target proteins. The first discovered Fe-S assembly machinery was the Nif system of Azotobacter vinelandii, which is responsible for the formation of Fe-S clusters for nitrogenase (7Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The second machinery was the Isc system first discovered in A. vinelandii and later in Escherichia coli, which has a housekeeping function in the formation of other cellular Fe-S proteins (8Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Fe-S assembly systems in eukaryotes are remarkably similar to this Isc system (6Johnson D. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 9Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The third machinery was the suf system of E. coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi, which appears to be responsible for the formation of Fe-S clusters under oxidative stress and iron limitation (10Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 11Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 12Outten F.W. Djaman O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarities, several of the plastid Fe-S biosynthesis components tentatively identified to date are most related to the bacterial suf cluster genes; other components are unique, however (5Balk J. Lobreaux S. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts have their own Fe-S assembly systems (13Takahashi Y. Mitsui A. Hase T. Matsubara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2434-2437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Takahashi Y. Mitsui A. Matsubara H. Plant Physiol. 1990; 95: 97-103Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fe-S cluster assembly into radiolabeled freshly imported ferredoxin precursor was demonstrated using isolated intact chloroplasts (15Li H.-M. Theg S.M. Bauerle C.M. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 8: 6748-6752Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reaction proceeds in the absence of cytosol (16Pilon M. America T. van't Hof R. de Kruijff B. Weisbeek P. Rothman S.S. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. 1. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1995: 229-255Google Scholar). The presence of supersaturated amounts of oxygen in green tissues provides a challenge for the synthesis and maintenance of plastid Fe-S cluster proteins because of the sensitivity of these clusters to oxygen (1Beinert H. Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be anticipated that next to the synthesis of new clusters, chloroplasts must have unique mechanisms to replace or repair oxidatively damaged clusters. Characterization of the chloroplastic Fe-S formation machinery started with the identification of a Cys desulfurase CpNifS (17Leon S. Touraine B. Briat J.F. Lobreaux S. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M.

Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 993-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and CpIscA (22Abdel-Ghany S.E. Ye H. Garifullina G.F. Zhang L. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CpNifS is the Cys desulfurase that converts cysteine into alanine and elemental sulfur for Fe-S formation. CpNfu2 can hold a transient Fe-S cluster. Insertion mutants in the CpNfu2 gene have a dwarf phenotype and are deficient in 2Fe-2S and 4Fe-4S proteins (20Touraine B. Boutin J.P. Marion-Poll A. Briat J.F. Peltier G. Lobreaux S. Plant J. 2004; 40: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Yabe T. Morimoto K. Kikuchi S. Nishio K. Terashima I. Nakai M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 993-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). CpIscA is a putative alternative scaffold that can accept a 2Fe-2S cluster from CpNifS, which can be transferred to apoferredoxin in vitro (22Abdel-Ghany S.E. Ye H. Garifullina G.F. Zhang L. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, other Suf-type system components (23Moller G.M. Kunkel T. Chua N.-H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 24Xu X.M. Moller S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant J. 2004; 37: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) may assist the Fe-S formation in plastids. The CpSufBCD complex is an ATPase and may be involved in providing ferrous iron or in transferring the Fe-S cluster from the scaffold protein to the target protein (23Moller G.M. Kunkel T. Chua N.-H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 24Xu X.M. Moller S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6648-6654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HCF101 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 101) encodes a NifH-related P-loop ATPase that seems to be required for 4Fe-4S but not 2Fe-2S assembly in chloroplasts (26Lezhneva L. Amann K. Meurer J. Plant J. 2004; 37: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Since cysteine was identified as the sulfur source for Fe-S formation in chloroplasts (13Takahashi Y. Mitsui A. Hase T. Matsubara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2434-2437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Takahashi Y. Mitsui A. Matsubara H. Plant Physiol. 1990; 95: 97-103Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the Cys desulfurase activity of CpNifS is probably essential for Fe-S formation in chloroplasts. Indeed, the depletion of CpNifS led to the loss of Fe-S reconstitution activity of chloroplast stroma (27Ye H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Zhang L. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. Planta. 2005; 220: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This Cys desulfurase of chloroplasts is distinct from the Cys desulfurases NifS and IscS of the Nif and Isc type assembly systems and is more similar in sequence to SufS (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vitro, the purified CpNifS has a much lower Cys desulfurase activity than SeCys lyase activity (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the Fe-S cluster reconstitution activity of CpNifS in stroma is 50-80-fold higher than that of CpNifS alone, suggesting that some factors, most likely proteins, are activating the Cys desulfurase activity of CpNifS (27Ye H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Zhang L. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. Planta. 2005; 220: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The activation mechanism has been unclear until the characterization of CpSufE in this study. CpSufE is the latest component of the Suf-type Fe-S formation system identified in Arabidopsis chloroplasts. We show here that CpSufE forms a complex with CpNifS, thus stimulating Cys desulfurase activity over 40-fold and enhancing CpNifS-dependent Fe-S reconstitution in vitro. Cloning and Plasmid Construction—The A. thaliana CpSufE coding sequence was amplified by PCR using cDNA as a template. cDNA was prepared from DNase-treated total RNA prepared from 2-week old seedlings as described (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H.

Primers used for CpSufE amplification were SufE-precursor and SufE-Bam (Table 1). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and then ligated into vector pET11d (Novagen, Madison, WI), digested with the same restriction enzymes to produce plasmid pPrSufE. To subclone the mature sequence of CpSufE in pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) for expression as a His6-tagged protein, PCR was performed with a set of nested primers, SufE-mature and SufE-Bam (Table 1). Plasmid pPrSufE was used as a template.

The two products from the first round of PCR were together used as a template for the second round of PCR, with primers SufE-mature and SufE-Bam (Table 1). The resulting PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and subcloned in vector pET28a to produce plasmid pMSufEC65S. For green fluorescent protein (GFP) localization, the transit peptide coding sequence of CpSufE was amplified with flanking primers SufE-GFP-F and SufE-GFP-RT (Table 1), whereas the full-length protein sequence was amplified with flanking primers SufE-GFP-F and SufE-GFP-R (Table 1).

The final PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and ligated into vector pET11d, resulting in pMNFSC388S. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids used for protoplast transformation were prepared using the Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sequence Analysis and Alignments—Sequence analysis was performed using the Mac Vector sequence analysis software (International Biotechnologies, New Haven, CT). Searches for sequence similarity were performed using the BLAST network service provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW at European Bioinformatics Institute, ExPASY Proteomics tools (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw). Preparation of Proteins—For overexpression of CpSufE, E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was transformed with plasmid pMSufE or with pMSufEC65S for the mutant protein. Two liters of LB medium containing 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin was inoculated with one-one hundredth volume of overnight culture. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5, and expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside followed by incubation for 3 h at 37 °C. The culture was chilled on ice, and the cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 × g at 4 °C. From here on, all procedures were performed at 4 °C except where mentioned. The bacterial pellet was washed with 150 mm NaCl and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then passed twice through a French press (8,000 p.s.i.) to disrupt the cells. The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 12,500 × g, and the cleared supernatant was loaded at a flow rate of 3 ml min-1 onto His-Bind iminodiacetic acid (IDA)-agarose (Novagen, Madison, WI) in a 1.6 × 20-cm column, which was saturated with NiSO4, washed, and equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was washed with 4 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by 4 volumes of 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, again, and 2 volumes of 0.1 m imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, respectively. His6-tagged CpSufE was eluted with 4 volumes of 1 m imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions of 6 ml were collected. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Pure His-tagged CpSufE ran as a single band on SDS-PAGE after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To produce cleaved CpSufE, the pooled peak fractions were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, followed by incubation with thrombin in a 1:1,000 (w/w) ratio (thrombin/target protein) at 4 °C for 8 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, as suggested by the manufacturer (Novagen, Madison, WI). The cleavage mixture was subsequently applied to a 10 × 1-cm Resource-Q column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at room temperature and connected to a Summit HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The column was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and fractions of 2 ml were collected. Elution was monitored by detection of the OD at 280 and 220 nm. The purified cleaved CpSufE was dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stored frozen at -80 °C before use in activity assays. Typical yields were 5-10 mg/liter of culture. The purified protein migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel) and ran as a single peak in analytical HPLC runs on a 1-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The His6-tagged and cleaved CpSufEC65S were purified essentially as the WT CpSufE protein. WT CpNifS protein was prepared as described before (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For overexpression of CpNifSC388S, E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was transformed with plasmid pMNFSC388S. The recombinant CpNifSC388S was prepared essentially as WT CpNifS (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Purified CpNifSC388S was eluted from a calibrated 1 × 30-cm Superdex-S200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) at the same retention time as the WT protein, and a native molecular mass of 83 kDa was calculated, suggesting that CpNifSC388S is a dimer like the wild type protein. Holo- and apoferredoxin were prepared as described (27Ye H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Zhang L. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. Planta. 2005; 220: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Cys desulfurase activity was assayed at 25 °C essentially as described (29Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M. Storz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45713-45719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Briefly, 160 μl of reaction mixture contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 μm enzyme (0.11 mg/ml CpNifS, 0.09 mg/ml CpSufE), 10 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ), 1 mm dithiothreitol (Roche Applied Science), and 500 μm cysteine (Sigma). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 20 mm N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine in 7.2 m HCl. Methylene blue was formed by the addition of 20 μl of 30 mm FeCl3 in 1.2 m HCl and was assayed by measuring the absorbance at 670 nm. The SeCys lyase activity was measured as described (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to 1 μmol of substrate converted/min. To estimate kinetic constants for both the Cys desulfurase and SeCys lyase activities of CpNifS, the reaction velocities were measured over a wide range of substrate concentrations (0.01-20 mm). The data in Michaelis-Menten plots were fitted by an iterative method to estimate Km and Vmax values, using the software program Enzfitter (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The Fe-S reconstitution assay was performed as described before (27Ye H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Zhang L. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. Planta. 2005; 220: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For all statistical analyses, the JMP-IN software (SAS institute, Cary, NC) was used. Gel Filtration—Sizes of protein complexes were estimated by gel filtration experiments, as described before (27Ye H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Zhang L. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. Planta. 2005; 220: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The column used was a 1 × 30-cm Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was connected to a summit HPLC system with a UVD170 detector and controlled by Chromeleon software (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The loop size was 0.2 ml. The column was equilibrated in 25 mm Tricine/KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl. The flow rate was 0.75 ml/min, and fractions were collected every 0.5 min. Elution was monitored by absorbance at both 280 and 220 nm and by immunoblotting of collected fractions. The void volume was determined with blue dextran. Standards used for calibration were IgY, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen, and RNase. Protein Coelution Experiment—100 μg of His-tagged CpSufE (WT or mutant) and possible partner proteins were mixed at room temperature in 500 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and loaded on a 0.5-ml His-Bind IDA-agarose column (Novagen, Madison, WI). The column was washed with 2 ml of buffer and subsequently with 2 ml of 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, again, and 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m imidazole. Finally, the column was eluted with 2 ml of 1 m imidazole, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Samples incubated with cysteine were eluted with all solutions containing 1 mm cysteine, whereas samples incubated without cysteine were eluted with solutions free of cysteine. Proteins eluted with 1 m imidazole were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Separation of CpNifS-CpSufE Complexes on Native Gel—5 μg of CpSufE (WT or mutant) was mixed with 5 μg of CpNifS (WT or mutant) in a final volume of 15 μl, with or without 1 mm cysteine. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, proteins were mixed with an equal volume of 20% (w/v) glycerol, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and separated by native PAGE, using a 4% stacking gel, a 10% separating gel, and the Laemmli buffer system with the omission of SDS. 5 μg of each single protein was loaded as control. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Plant Sampling—A. thaliana (Ecotype Columbia-0) plants were grown on soil with supplementary light on a 15-h light/9-h dark cycle for 4 weeks. Total leaf homogenate, chloroplast stroma, and RNA from different tissues were prepared as described (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For light regulation analysis of CpSufE, Arabidopsis plants were grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog agar medium (30Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 437-497Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar) for 2 weeks, either on a 15-h light/9-h dark cycle or in complete darkness. Protein and RNA preparations from total leaf homogenate were described before (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of GFP Fusion Proteins—The plasmids TP/SufE-GFP or full-length/SufE-GFP were transformed into Arabidopsis protoplasts, and expressed proteins were observed under a confocal microscope, as described (22Abdel-Ghany S.E. Ye H. Garifullina G.F. Zhang L. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Cleaved CpSufE in 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, was used to raise polyclonal antibody in rabbits at a commercial facility (PRF&L, Canadensis, PA). The CpNifS antibodies have been described (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The Hsp70 antibody was purchased from Sigma. RuBisCo antibody was purchased from AgriSera (Vannas, Sweden). Immunoblotting was performed as described (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Garifullina G.F. Abdel-Ghany S. Kato S. Mihara H. Hale K.L. Burkhead J.L. Esaki N. Kurihara T. Pilon M.

RNA Blot Analysis—Total RNA from different Arabidopsis tissues was prepared, electrophoresed, and probed with a 32P-labeled 900-bp CpSufE cDNA, essentially as described before (18Pilon-Smits E.A.H.

https://openalex.org/W2073917902,"Directed evolution was performed on vanadium chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis to increase its brominating activity at a mildly alkaline pH for industrial and synthetic applications and to further understand its mechanism. After successful expression of the enzyme in Escherichia coli, two rounds of screening and selection, saturation mutagenesis of a “hot spot,” and rational recombination, a triple mutant (P395D/L241V/T343A) was obtained that showed a 100-fold increase in activity at pH 8 (kcat = 100 s-1). The increased Km values for Br- (3.1 mm) and H2O2 (16 μm) are smaller than those found for vanadium bromoperoxidases that are reasonably active at this pH. In addition the brominating activity at pH 5 was increased by a factor of 6 (kcat = 575 s-1), and the chlorinating activity at pH 5 was increased by a factor of 2 (kcat = 36 s-1), yielding the “best” vanadium haloperoxidase known thus far. The mutations are in the first and second coordination sphere of the vanadate cofactor, and the catalytic effects suggest that fine tuning of residues Lys-353 and Phe-397, along with addition of negative charge or removal of positive charge near one of the vanadate oxygens, is very important.

This study presents the first example of directed evolution of a vanadium enzyme. Haloperoxidases catalyze the oxidation of halides to hypohalous acids (see Equation 1), an industrially interesting reaction; these enzymes can be used to halogenate various organic compounds (1Littlechild J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Dembitsky V.M. Tetrahedron. 2003; 59: 4701-4720Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (see Equation 2). In addition they may provide an alternative biocide in antifouling applications (3Wever, R., Dekker, H. L., Van Schijndel, J. W. P. M., and Vollenbroek, E. G. M.

H2O2+X-+H+→HOX+H2O(Eq. 1) HOX+AH→AX+H2O(Eq. 2) where X is clorine, bromine, or iodine, and A is an organic nucleophilic acceptor. Presently two classes of enzymes are known that efficiently catalyze the oxidation of a halide by hydrogen peroxide, the vanadium haloperoxidases and the heme peroxidases. The heme peroxidases have a significant disadvantage of rapid inactivation during turnover because of an oxidative reaction of the heme group with the peroxide substrate and the formed hypohalous acids. Vanadium haloperoxidases (VHPOs), 2The abbreviations used are: VHPO, vanadium haloperoxidase; VCPO, vanadium chloroperoxidase; VBPO, vanadium bromoperoxidase; epPCR, error-prone PCR; LB, Luria Broth medium; MCD, monochlorodimedone; FPLC, fast liquid protein chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: VHPO, vanadium haloperoxidase; VCPO, vanadium chloroperoxidase; VBPO, vanadium bromoperoxidase; epPCR, error-prone PCR; LB, Luria Broth medium; MCD, monochlorodimedone; FPLC, fast liquid protein chromatography. which contain vanadate (VO43-) as a prosthetic group, do not suffer from this disadvantage (9Renirie R. Pierlot C. Aubry J.M. Hartog A.F. Schoemaker H.E. Alsters P.L. Wever R. Adv. Synth. Cat. 2003; 345: 849-858Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar); in addition they are much more resistant toward heat, detergent, and solvent denaturation (10De Boer E. Plat H. Tromp M.G.M. Franssen M.C.R. Van der Plas H.C. Meijer E.M. Schoemaker H.E. Wever R. Biotechnol. Bioeng. Symp. 1987; 30: 607-610Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The major drawback of all haloperoxidases including the stable VHPOs is that they are mainly active at mildly acidic pH values, whereas for many applications activity at mildly alkaline pH values is required. An example of this is their potential use as an antifouling agent in marine paints (3Wever, R., Dekker, H. L., Van Schijndel, J. W. P. M., and Vollenbroek, E. G. M. (October 12, 1995) Patent WO 95/27009Google Scholar, 4Johansen, C. (February 25, 1999) Patent WO 99/08531Google Scholar, 5Svendsen, A. and Jorgensen, L. (April 16, 2002) U. S. Patent 6,372,465Google Scholar), an application inspired by their putative role in vivo. Many brown seaweeds contain vanadium haloperoxidases that are present on the plant surface (11Wever R. Tromp M.G.M. Krenn B.E. Marjani A. Van Tol M. Environ. Sci. Technol. 1991; 25: 446-449Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and apart from the direct antimicrobial activity of HOBr and HOCl it was demonstrated that these hypohalous acids react rapidly with homoserine lactone derivatives produced by bacteria as communication signals (quorum sensing) thus preventing biofilm formation on the surface of these seaweeds (12Borchardt S.A. Allain E.J. Michels J.J. Stearns G.W. Kelly R.F. McCoy W.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3174-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Current antifouling technologies are often very environmentally unfriendly, but still being used because of the absence of good alternatives. Crystal structures of VHPOs have shown peculiar vanadium chemistry: the enzymes shuttle between a trigonal bipyramidal structure (native) and a distorted tetragonal structure (peroxo-intermediate) (see Fig. 1). Despite considerable additional data (kinetic, genetic, mutational, and spectroscopic) on VHPOs from different organisms (16Wever R. Hemrika W. Huber R. Poulos T. Wieghardt K. Handbook of Metalloproteins. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester2001: 1417-1428Google Scholar, 17Littlechild J. Garcia-Rodriguez E. Dalby A. Isupov M. J. Mol.

Rev. 2003; 237: 65-76Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), several questions about these enzymes remain to be answered. Especially the factors governing the halide specificity and pH optima are not fully understood. Fig. 2 shows a picture emerging from three previously published proposals (14Renirie R. Hemrika W. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11650-11657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Zampella G. Fantucci P. Pecoraro V.L. De Gioia L. J. Am. Chem.

A. 1996; 93: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) on the differences between vanadium chloroperoxidases (VCPOs) and vanadium bromoperoxidases (VBPOs). It was suggested that binding of the halide in VCPO is assisted by residues Phe-397 and Trp-350 via their δ+ ring edge (19Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The VBPOs have a histidine in the position corresponding to Phe-397 and the VBPOs from the marine algae Corallina officinalis and Corallina pilulifera have an arginine in the position of Trp-350 (17Littlechild J. Garcia-Rodriguez E. Dalby A. Isupov M. J. Mol. Recognit. 2002; 15: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting that differences in specificity may be partially explained by amino acid variations at these two positions. In addition to differences in direct binding of the halide, it was suggested that in the VBPO from the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum the bound peroxide is deprotonated by His-411 (Fig. 2), thereby reducing the oxidative strength of these enzymes and their affinity for the halide (14Renirie R. Hemrika W. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11650-11657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The assigned full positive charge on the protonated peroxide oxygen in VCPO was also suggested to give rise to the very strong uncompetitive inhibition by azide seen in VCPO, being absent in wild-type VBPOs (20Tanaka N. Wever R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A VBPO mutant from C. pilulifera that essentially has become a VCPO was also strongly inhibited by azide (21Oshiro T. Littlechild J. Garcia-Rodriguez E. Isupov M.N. Iida Y. Kobayashi T. Izumi Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1566-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The His-411 of VBPO from A. nodosum also forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytically important Lys-341, and it was suggested that this decreases the polarizing effect of this histidine on the bound peroxide (15Zampella G. Fantucci P. Pecoraro V.L. De Gioia L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A clear explanation for the pH profiles in these enzymes is lacking, but interestingly, the optima of the VBPOs are shifted to more neutral pH values (5.5-6.0) as compared with the VCPOs (pH 4.5-5.0). Attempts to rationally modify the properties of these enzymes by site-directed mutagenesis have only met limited success. Two variants of VCPO from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis with a reduced positive charge near the vanadate cofactor (R360A and R490A) showed higher brominating activity at alkaline pH; however these mutants inactivated during turnover and lost most of their ability to oxidize chloride (22Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The most successful attempt to date has been a site-directed mutagenesis study in which substantial chlorinating activity (40 s-1) was introduced in a VBPO from the marine algae C. pilulifera (mutants R397W and R397F); however the reported Km values for Cl- of two mutants were very high (∼700 mm) (22Hemrika W.

Halide binding in VCPO was suggested to be assisted by residues Phe-397 and Trp-350 via their δ+ ring edge (19Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar); VBPOs have a histidine in the position corresponding to Phe-397, and the VBPOs from C. officinalis and C. pilulifera have an arginine in the position of Trp-350 (17Littlechild J. Garcia-Rodriguez E. Dalby A. Isupov M. J. Mol. Recognit. 2002; 15: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In VBPO from A. nodosum the bound peroxide may be deprotonated by His-411, thereby reducing the oxidative strength of these enzymes and their affinity for the halide (14Renirie R. Hemrika W. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11650-11657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The His-411 of VBPO from A. nodosum also forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytically important Lys-341 (15Zampella G. Fantucci P. Pecoraro V.L. De Gioia L. J. Am. Chem.

This enzyme is evolutionarily related to the mentioned seaweed peroxidases, and a recombinant system for producing VCPO is available. Kinetic studies have shown that although the enzyme effectively oxidizes bromide (kcat = 100 s-1) at pH 5 it has a kcat of only 1 s-1 at the slightly alkaline pH of seawater (pH 8) (22Hemrika W.

In this study we obtained a VCPO triple mutant exhibiting 100-fold higher activity at pH 8, as well as an increase in the brominating and chlorinating activity at pH 5 by factors of 6 and 2, respectively. Apart from potential applications of this mutant, the results generate more fuel to the discussion about the role of various catalytic residues in these enzymes. Expression of VCPO in Escherichia coli—We expressed VCPO in a TOP10 E. coli host expression system (Invitrogen) for efficient expression and screening of mutants. The cDNA encoding the VCPO gene was amplified from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression plasmid pTNT14 (22Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using the forward primer 5′-CTGAGCTAGCCATATGGGGTCCGTTACACCCATCC-3′ (NheI site underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-AAGGTACCCTACGGCGCCTCCTTGACTACCGG-3′ (KpnI site underlined) using Pfu turbo polymerase (Invitrogen). Following digestion with NheI and KpnI restriction enzymes the DNA was ligated into pBADgIIIB (Invitrogen) restricted with the same enzymes. This construct includes the gIII signal sequence to facilitate VCPO secretion into the E. coli periplasm. E. coli TOP10 cells were transformed with the construct pBADVCPO and plated onto LB agar (100 μg·ml-1 ampicillin). Single colonies were tested for expression by checking the phenol red bromination activity at pH 5.0. Optimum expression of VCPO was obtained by growing cells at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.6-0.8, cooling cells to 25 °C and inducing with 0.02% l-arabinose, and growing for another 20-24 h. The expression of VCPO in E. coli yielded an enzyme production of 10 mg·liter-1 culture. The recombinant E. coli VCPO showed similar kinetic parameters to the previously recombinant enzyme that was expressed in the yeast S. cerevisiae (22Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol.

Random Mutagenesis, Saturation Mutagenesis, and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The protein sequence space was explored by using the error-prone (ep) PCR (25Chen K. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5618-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 26Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique (Phila.). 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar) as the mutagenesis method, using either the GeneMorph™ I or II kit (Stratagene). epPCR was performed on 1.3 Kb, thereby leaving out the 0.5 Kb 5′-end that codes for the N-terminal of the enzyme. This region is far removed from the catalytic core and is thought to be involved in the stability of VCPO. The primers used were the forward primer 5′-CCTCAACGATCCTCGAGGTGCTTCGC-3′ (XhoI site underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-CCATATGGTACCCTACGGCGCCTCCTTGACTACCGG-3′ (KpnI site underlined). An average frequency of 1.6 base changes per kilobase was verified by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotech AG) of 10 independent colonies. The amplified DNA was subcloned into the XhoI-KpnI digested pBADVCPO and transformed back into E. coli TOP10 cells. From an estimated library size of 2 × 104, 5000 colonies were robotically picked and transferred to the 96-well format and grown in LB to prepare cells for glycerol stocks. For the second generation library, a similar procedure for library construction and preparation was followed, and 8000 colonies were screened. Saturation mutagenesis at Pro-395 residue was performed using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide designs were based on the following set of primers, sense primer 5′-CAACGACATTCCATTCAAGNNNCCTTTCCCAGCTTACCC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGGTAAGCTGGGAAAGGNNNCTTGAATGGAATGTCGTTGG-3′ using the optimal codon requirement (at positions underlined) for E. coli expression. The QuikChange™ kit was also used to construct the site-directed control mutants using the oligonucleotides, L241V (sense) 5′-CGCAGAGCGAGCACTTCGTGGCCGACCCACCGGGCC-3′, L241V(antisense) 5′-GGCCCGGTGGGTCGGCCACGAAGTGCTCGCTCTGCG-3′; T343A (sense) 5′-CGTCGACGTCGCTTGCGCAGACGCTGGTATCTTTTCC-3′, T343A(antisense) 5′-GGAAAAGATACCAGCGTCTGCGCAAGCGACGTCGACG-3′; R360C (sense) 5′-GGGAGTTCGAATTCTGGTGCCCACTATCTGGTGTGCG-3′, R360C(antisense) 5′-CGCACACCAGATAGTGGGCACCAGAATTCGAACTCCC-3′; A399S (sense) 5′-CCATTCAAGCCTCCTTTCCCATCTTACCCATCTGGTCACGCGACC-3′, A399S(antisense) 5′-GGTCGCGTGACCAGATGGGTAAGATGGGAAAGGAGGCTTGAATGG-3′ (codons for amino acid are underlined, and mutagenesis position are in italics). High Throughput Expression of VCPO Mutants—Cell growth and enzyme expression was performed in 2-ml volume, 96-well format polypropylene deep well plates (Greiner Bio-One). Using a 96-pin colony replicator, frozen cells were transferred to the deep well plates containing 1 ml of liquid LB medium with 100 μg·ml-1 ampicillin and 0.02% l-arabinose and covered with Breath Seal porous films (Greiner Bio-One). The cells were grown using an INFORS Microtron plate shaker for 24 h at 25 °C at 560 rpm. The plates were chilled to 4 °C and centrifuged at 3500 rpm (Beckmann S5700). The media were removed, the cells were washed with 50 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8.3, lysed by resuspending and incubating in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 μg·ml-1 Lysozyme, 40 Kunitz units·ml- DNase, 4 mm MgSO4, 0.05% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8.0) for 10 min, followed by a freeze-thaw cycle. The suspensions were then transferred to V-bottom microtiter plates and centrifuged as before. The supernatants were removed to fresh flat bottom microtiter plates, and aliquots were used for screening assays. High Throughput Assay and Kinetic Analysis of the Most Promising Mutants—For the initial high throughput screening of mutants a phenol red-based assay was used (10De Boer E. Plat H. Tromp M.G.M. Franssen M.C.R. Van der Plas H.C. Meijer E.M. Schoemaker H.E. Wever R. Biotechnol. Bioeng. Symp. 1987; 30: 607-610Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This assay exhibits a color change from deep pink to purple (bromphenol blue) upon bromination at pH 8.0. The assay conditions used for the initial screen were 1 mm Br- (the concentration in seawater (27Riley J.P. Chester R. Introduction to Marine Chemistry. Academic Press, London and New York1971: 60Google Scholar)), 10 mm H2O2, 100 μm vanadate (the enzyme is expressed as an apo-protein), 50 μm phenol red, and 100 mm Tris SO4, pH 8.0. The hydrogen peroxide concentration in the initial screen was 10 times higher than that used in a standard VCPO assay to compensate for potential depletion of H2O2 by endogenous catalase in the cell lysates (28Claiborne A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4245-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Enzyme dilutions and assays were performed by a Roboseq SE automated liquid handling system (MWG Biotech AG) and rates of phenol red bromination followed by a 96-well plate reader at 590 nm (Fluostar Galaxy, BMG Labtech). Aliquots of enzyme lysates (10 μl) were transferred to flat bottom microtiter plates, and a 90-μl phenol red solution (100 mm Tris SO4, pH 8.0, 100 μm vanadate (sodium salt), 10 mm H2O2, 1 mm KBr, 50 μm phenol red) was added, and plates were vortexed at 500 rpm for 10 s. VCPO variants exhibiting increased phenol red bromination in the initial screen were sequenced and also reassayed using 50 μm monochlorodimedone (MCD) (2-chloro-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dimedon), a more effective bromide acceptor (30Soedjak H.S. Walker J. Butler A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12689-12693Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Van Schijndel J.W.P.M. Barnett P. Roelse J. Vollenbroek E.G.M. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), to calculate precise turnover numbers. This reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by following the absorbance decrease at 290 nm (Δϵ = 20 mm-1 cm-1). From these mutants the four most active mutants were grown on a large scale and purified and reassayed with the MCD assay. Enzyme samples were transferred to quartz cuvettes (100 mm Tris SO4, pH 8.0, 100 μm vanadate (sodium salt), 1 mm H2O2, 1 mm Br-, 50 μm MCD). The halogenation rates were followed using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Purification of Enzymes and Mutants—S. cerevisiae VCPO was produced and purified as described before (22Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Purification of E. coli VCPO was similar to the S. cerevisiae VCPO; disruption of the yeast cells by glass beads was replaced by sonication of the E. coli cells. In addition, the last FPLC step from the S. cerevisiae VCPO purification was omitted because it did not result in further purification of the E. coli VCPO. VBPO from the seaweed A. nodosum was harvested and purified as described before (32De Boer E. Van Kooyk Y. Tromp M.G.M. Plat H. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 872: 104-115Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). E. coli Expression System and Generation of Mutants—For our directed evolution, expression of VCPO in an E. coli host was desirable. Our VCPO was successfully expressed, yielding an enzyme production of 10 mg·liter-1 culture, sufficient for convenient high throughput screening. In the past expression of vanadium haloperoxidases in E. coli was cumbersome and only low levels of protein expression were obtained due to inclusion body formation (0.1-0.3 mg/liter culture for VBPO from C. officinalis (23Carter J.N. Beatty K.E. Simpson M.T. Butler A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) and a very low yield for VBPO from C. pilulifera (24Shimonishi M. Kuwamoto S. Inoue H. Wever R. Oshiro T. Izumi Y. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We optimized our system by inducing the cells at 25 °C, similar to the study of recombinant VBPO from C. officinalis (23Carter J.N. Beatty K.E. Simpson M.T. Butler A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); however our yield of soluble active protein was much higher. For the Corallina VBPOs the more difficult expression is probably because of the fact that they are dodecameric enzymes as opposed to the monomeric VCPO. For the dimeric VBPO from A. nodosum expression is also difficult because of the presence of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds. Error-prone PCR mutagenesis was then successfully used to create VCPO mutant libraries and DNA sequence analysis revealed 1.1 amino acid changes on average per mutant. Screening of 5 × 103 mutants in round one and 8 × 103 in round two was performed using a phenol red-based assay (1 mm Br-, pH 8.0) to identify variant enzymes with enhanced bromination activity. Table 1 summarizes the results of two rounds of screening, saturation mutagenesis of hot spot residue Pro-395, and rational recombination of selected mutants.TABLE 1VCPO mutants with enhanced activity at alkaline pH obtained by directed evolutionMutantActivity enhancement factor at pH 8.0aAssay conditions 1 mm H2O2, 1 mm Br−, 100 μm vanadate, 50 μm MCD, 100 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.0.Wild-type VCPO1First generationbCell lysates.R360C/I391V5P395H/A399S5P395T6Second generationcPurified enzyme.P395T/T343A14P395T/L241V19Saturation mutagenesisbCell lysates.P395D10P395E10Recombined mutantscPurified enzyme.P395T/L241V/T343A20P395D/L241V/T343A (1 mm Br−)40P395D/L241V/T343A (100 mm Br−)100Control mutantsbCell lysates.R360C5A399S1.2T343A4L241V7a Assay conditions 1 mm H2O2, 1 mm Br−, 100 μm vanadate, 50 μm MCD, 100 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.0.b Cell lysates.c Purified enzyme. Open table in a new tab Analysis of Mutants—Ultimately the best mutant generated was the triple mutant P395D/L241V/T343A with a 40-times-increased brominating activity under our screening conditions (1 mm Br-). Fig. 3 depicts the peroxo-intermediate of the enzyme showing that the mutated residues are in close proximity to the VCPO active site residues. Pro-395 showed up as a hot spot in the first generation; a P395T mutant and a P395H/A399S double mutant were found (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows that Pro-395 borders the active site channel and neighbors Phe-397, a residue that is believed to be a part of the halide-binding site (19Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Mutation of Pro-395 may influence both the electrostatics in the vicinity of Phe-397 (influencing its δ-/δ+ distribution) and the orientation of Phe-397, either directly or via increased backbone flexibility. Ala-399 is also close to Phe-397; however a A399S control mutant only showed a small increase in activity compared with wild type. In addition, a generated P395H mutant had a similar activity as the P395H/A399S mutant, excluding an important role for the A399S mutation.FIGURE 4View of the active site channel of VCPO showing the position of Pro-395, mutation of which to several residues (aspartic acid and glutamic acid in particular) leads to increased activity at pH 8. The vanadate cofactor (VO4), Pro-395, and Phe-397 are shown as spheres, whereas the surrounding residues are shown as surface. In addition to electrostatic effects on the vanadate oxygens and the putative halide-binding residue Phe-397, increased flexibility of Phe-397 may explain the observed tuning of the activity. This figure was made with PyMOL (33DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. San Carlos, CA, U. S. A.2002Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The other mutant from the first generation, R360C/I391V, indicated a second hot spot. An R360A mutant previously generated by site-directed mutagenesis also exhibited a higher activity at alkaline conditions (22Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). An R360C control mutant was identical to the R360C/I391V variant (not shown), excluding an important role for the I391V mutation. Arg-360 has an important role in binding the vanadate cofactor, and, interestingly, also stabilizes the position of Phe-397 by forming a hydrogen bond to its carbonyl group, as shown in Fig. 5. In fact, the crystal structure of R360A mutant shows that the torsion angle of the Phe-397 ring changes as a result of the mutation (34Macedo-Ribeiro S. Hemrika W. Renirie R. Wever R. Messerschmidt A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus both mutated residues from the first round of screening (Pro-395 and Arg-360) may influence the position or orientation of Phe-397. This residue was previously suggested to support halide binding via its δ+ ring edge (Fig. 2, left panel), as also observed in haloalkane dehalogenases (35Verschueren K.H.G. Seljée F. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In this respect it is interesting to note that in our final mutant a higher bromide concentration is required than in"
https://openalex.org/W1965552134,"The transcriptional activation of GRP78, which controls multiple signaling pathways of the unfolded protein response, has been used extensively as an indicator for the onset of endoplasmic reticulum stress in tissue culture systems. Here we investigate the mechanism of Grp78 induction during mouse embryonic development. Our results reveal that in transgenic mouse models, reporter gene activity driven by the Grp78 promoter is strongly activated during early embryonic heart development but subsides in later stages. This activation is strictly dependent on a 100-base pair region of the Grp78 promoter containing the endoplasmic reticulum stress response elements (ERSEs). Previous studies establish that endoplasmic reticulum stress induces in vivo binding of YY1 and the nuclear form of ATF6 to the ERSE. Since the expression of YY1 as well as ATF6 is ubiquitous in the mouse embryo, activation of the Grp78 promoter in the early embryonic heart may involve a specific mechanism. Here we report that GATA-4, a transcription factor essential for heart development, binds to the Grp78 promoter in vivo and activates the ERSE, which does not contain a consensus GATA binding site. GATA-4 cooperatively activates the Grp78 promoter with YY1, and the DNA binding domain of YY1 is necessary and sufficient for this cooperation. In addition, GATA-4 activation of the Grp78 promoter is enhanced by the nuclear form of ATF6, and this synergy is further potentiated by YY1. These results suggest that during early heart organogenesis, Grp78 can be activated through cooperation between the cell type-specific transcription factors and ERSE-binding factors.

Glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) 3The abbreviations used are: GRP, glucose-regulated protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CRE, cAMP-response element; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERSE, ER stress response element; TG, transgenic; UPR, unfolded protein response; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription. are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-binding chaperone proteins (1Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The ER is a cellular organelle where secretory and membrane proteins are synthesized and modified and is also a major intracellular calcium storage compartment inside the cell. Under physiological or pharmacological ER stresses, such as a block in protein glycosylation, accumulation of malfolded proteins, or depletion of ER calcium storage, the cells have developed an evolutionarily conserved defense mechanism called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (2Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). As a protective arm of the UPR, the GRPs are induced under these stress conditions to maintain ER homeostasis. The most abundant and best characterized GRP is GRP78, a 78-kilodalton protein also referred to as immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP) (3Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The induction of Grp78 has been used widely as an indicator of ER stress and the onset of the UPR. The transcriptional regulation of Grp78 under ER stress is mediated largely through the evolutionarily conserved ER stress element (ERSE) present on the promoters of UPR target genes (4Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 5Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The classic ERSE has a tripartite structure of CCAAT(N9)CCACG (where N9 represents a 9-bp GC-rich region). The CCAAT-binding factor NF-Y binds constitutively to the CCAAT motif of the ERSE and is required for transcription of the Grp78 promoter under both normal and stress conditions (5Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 6Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N9 GC-rich region of the ERSE binds the transcription factor TFII-I, which is autoregulated by ER stress and tyrosine phosphorylation and is known to facilitate protein-protein interactions (7Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Hong M. Lin M.Y. Huang J.M. Baumeister P. Hakre S. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16821-16828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). YY1 (Ying Yang 1), a 65-kDa zinc finger transcription factor, binds to the CCACG motif and activates the Grp78 promoter under ER stress (9Li W.W. Hsiung Y. Zhou Y. Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10Baumeister P. Luo S. Skarnes W.C. Sui G. Seto E. Shi Y. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4529-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). YY1 is ubiquitously expressed during mouse development, and homozygous deletion of YY1 is embryonically lethal (11Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Under ER stress conditions, a fraction of ATF6, a 90-kDa ER transmembrane transcription factor, relocates to the Golgi and is proteolytically cleaved. The 50-kDa N terminus of ATF6 that is generated migrates to the nucleus, binds to the CCACG element, and activates target gene transcription such as Grp78 (12Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X.

Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Both YY1 and TFII-I are co-activators of ATF6 (7Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4529-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Additionally, in mammalian cells, upon ER stress, XBP-1 mRNA is alternatively spliced by the ER transmembrane kinase Ire1p, and the spliced form of XBP-1 binds to the ERSE, resulting in target gene activation (14Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 15Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar). Despite these advances achieved through investigations using tissue culture systems and mostly through the use of pharmacological ER stress inducers, little is known of what constitutes ER stress in vivo. Previously, GRP78 protein expression has been detected as early as two-cell stage mouse embryos (16Kim S.K. Kim Y.K. Lee A.S. Differentiation. 1990; 42: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and immunohistochemical staining with purified antibody against GRP78 showed that it is highly elevated in mouse heart during early organogenesis (17Barnes J.A. Smoak I.W. Anat. Embryol. 2000; 202: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Toward understanding how Grp78 is regulated in vivo during mouse development, we have created transgenic mouse models whereby the LacZ reporter gene is driven by 3 kilobases of the rat Grp78 promoter (18Mao C. Dong D. Little E. Luo S. Lee A.S. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1013-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Initial analysis showed that the ERSE-LacZ model reflects the endogenous expression profile of Grp78 with highest expression in the early embryonic heart and that the promoter region containing the ERSE is critical for the LacZ activity (18Mao C. Dong D. Little E. Luo S. Lee A.S. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1013-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for the activation of the Grp78 promoter in the developing embryo is unknown. It is possible that the activation of the Grp78 promoter during organogenesis may involve tissue-specific transcription factors acting in concert with known UPR signaling pathways. For example, in cardiomyocytes, YY1 cooperates with the transcription factor GATA-4 to activate the promoter of the gene encoding the B-type natriuretic peptide, a peptide hormone synthesized and secreted from the heart (19Bhalla S.S. Robitaille L. Nemer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11439-11445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GATA-4 is a zinc finger DNA-binding protein belonging to the GATA family of transcription factors and is highly expressed in the myocardium during embryonic heart development. In this report, we showed that GATA-4 can bind to the Grp78 promoter in vivo and activate the ERSE, which does not contain a consensus GATA-4 site. The activation of the Grp78 promoter by GATA-4 is enhanced through interaction with the DNA binding domain of YY1 and can be synergized substantially by the nuclear, active form of ATF6 generated by ER stress. These results suggest that Grp78 can be activated through cooperation between organ-specific transcription factors and ERSE binding factors during development. Cell Culture Conditions and Drug Treatments—293T, HeLa, and CV1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics. Primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared as previously described (20Poizat C. Puri P.L. Bai Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2673-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For drug treatment, the cells were treated with either 300 nm thapsigargin or 1.5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 16 h prior to harvest. Plasmids—The construction of the plasmids 3kb/LacZ, D170/LacZ, and D300/LacZ has been previously described (21Luo S. Baumeister P. Yang S. Abcouwer S.F. Lee A.S. J. Biol.

The expression vector pCGN-ATF6(373) and the -457/LUC and -169/LUC reporter gene has been previously described (21Luo S. Baumeister P. Yang S. Abcouwer S.F. Lee A.S. J. Biol.

It was subcloned into the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega) between SacI and NheI sites. The expression vectors for FLAG-YY1 and its mutants were generous gifts from Dr. Edward Seto (University of South Florida) and have been previously described (23Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. Seto E. Mol.

The expression vector pCG-GATA-4 was kindly provided by Dr. Mona Nemer (Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal) and has been described previously (24Nemer G. Nemer M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 254: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Transfection and Reporter Assays—293T, HeLa, and CV1 cells were grown to 40% confluence in 6-well plates, and co-transfections were performed using Polyfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), as previously described (21Luo S. Baumeister P. Yang S. Abcouwer S.F. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37375-37385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For transfection of primary neonatal cardiomyocytes, cells were seeded at 90% confluence in 12-well plates, and co-transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). In each transfection, the total amount of DNA was adjusted to be the same with pcDNA3 empty vector. For co-transfection of -169/LUC with siRNA, the rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were seeded at 50% confluence in 12-well plates, and co-transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The siRNA against rat GATA-4 is 5′-GGTGA AATGG CTGTA AAATTT (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX), and the control siRNA against the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is 5′-CGGCA AGCTG ACCCT GAAGT TCAT (Qiagen). In general, the cells were harvested 24-36 h after transfection, except for siRNA treatment, when the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI) and normalized against the protein amount used in the assays. All of the transfection was performed in duplicates or triplicates. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The generation of the 3kbLacZ transgenic mouse has been described (25Dong D. Dubeau L. Bading J. Nguyen K. Luna M. Yu H. Gazit-Bornstein G. Gordon E.M. Gomer C. Hall F.L. Gambhir S. Lee A.S. Hum. Gene. Ther. 2004; 15: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Two independent lines were generated and examined. The D170LacZ and D300LacZ transgenic mice were generated identical to 3kbLacZ with the exception that the D170LacZ and D300LacZ plasmids were used to generate the BamHI fragments for injection. For each construct, fives transgenic lines were generated and analyzed. Generation of ATF6/βgeo Mouse and β-Galactosidase Staining—The ATF6/βgeo insertional mutation mouse was generously provided by Dr. William Skarnes (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute), and its generation has been described (26Skarnes W.C. Moss J.E. Hurtley S.M. Beddington R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Embryos from wild-type C57 mouse mated with ATF6/βgeo mouse were isolated, and whole-mount β-galactosidase staining was performed. Whole-mount β-Galactosidase Staining, Embryo Clearing, and Plastic Sectioning—Mouse embryos were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed with PBS for 15 min three times. The embryos were then subjected to β-galactosidase staining as previously described (27Reddy R.K. Dubeau L. Kleiner H. Parr T. Nichols P. Ko B. Dong D. Ko H. Mao C. DiGiovanni J. Lee A.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7207-7212PubMed Google Scholar). DNA from embryo yolk sacs was prepared for genotyping of mouse embryos as described (28Hogan B. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). For clearing, β-galactosidase-stained embryos were dehydrated by methanol and immersed in 2:1 benzyl benzoate/benzyl alcohol (28Hogan B. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). For plastic sectioning, whole-mount β-galactosidase stained embryos were embedded in JB-4 medium according to the manufacturer's protocol (Polysciences, Inc.). The embryos were then subjected to plastic sectioning at 4 μm in a JB-4 microtome section machine (SORVALL porter-blum). Pictures of the sections were taken and digitized under dark field with Nomarski optics. RNA Blot and RT-PCR—Total RNAs from whole embryos at different stages or different tissues of either embryos or adult mice were extracted, and Northern blots were performed as described (22Luo S. Lee A.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 787-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For RT-PCR assays, first strand cDNA was synthesized with Superscript III kit (Invitrogen). The primers used for the detection of the mouse YY1 mRNA were 5′-CAGAA GCAGG TGCAG ATCAA GACCCT (forward) and 5′-TTCCC GCAGC CTTCG AATGT GCACTGA (reverse), yielding a 460-bp product. The primers used for the detection of mouse ATF6 mRNA were 5′-TGCTA GGACT GGAGG CCAGG CTCAA (forward) and 5′-CATGT CTATG AACCC AGCCT CGAAGT (reverse), yielding a 350-bp product. The PCR primers against both spliced and unspliced forms of XBP-1 were as described by Iwawaki et al. (29Iwawaki T. Akai R. Kohno K. Miura M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Western Blot—Cell extracts from mouse embryonic fibroblasts of either the wild-type or the ATF6/βgeo homozygous mouse were separated on 7% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The ATF6 protein was detected as described previously (30Li M. Baumeister P. Roy B. Phan T. Foti D. Luo S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Protein extracts from 293T cells 48 h after co-transfection with GATA-4 expression vector and siRNA against GATA-4 (Ambion) or GFP (Qiagen) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and GATA-4 protein and β-actin were detected using the goat anti-GATA-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibody, respectively. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—293T cells were transfected with the pCG-GATA-4 plasmids and incubated for 48 h prior to fixation with formaldehyde. For primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, 1.4 × 108 cells were cultured for 8 days prior to formaldehyde fixation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (21Luo S. Baumeister P. Yang S. Abcouwer S.F. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37375-37385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). An aliquot was removed to be used as the input fraction and was processed with the eluted precipitates from the cross-link reversal step. Equal amounts of chromatin from each sample were incubated at 4 °C overnight with 10 μg of goat or rabbit anti-GATA-4 antibody or, for the detection of NF-Y/CBF, 3 μg each of anti-CBF-A, -B, and -C antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cross-linking was reversed overnight at 65 °C and was treated with proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C, and the DNA was then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and subjected to 40 cycles of PCR, and the products were run on a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. The P1/P2 primers used for the detection of the human Grp78 promoter were 5′-GTGAA CGTTA GAAAC GAATA GCAGCCA (forward) and 5′-GTCGA CCTCA CCGTC GCCTA (reverse), yielding a 213-bp product. The P3/P4 primers used for the detection of human Grp78 exon 8 were 5′-CCTCT GAAGA TAAGG AGACC ATGGAA (forward) and 5′-TGCTG TATCC TCTTC ACCAG TTGG (reverse), yielding a 187-bp product. The rP1/rP2 primers used for the detection of the equivalent rat Grp78 promoter region were 5′-GCGTA CCAGT GACGT GAGTT (forward) and 5′-CAGTG TAGTC ACAGC CAGTA TCG (reverse), yielding a 225-bp product. High Grp78 Promoter Activity in the Embryonic Heart Requires the ERSE—To investigate Grp78 expression in vivo and define the regulatory region of the Grp78 promoter mediating the expression, we generated transgenic (TG) mice using three LacZ reporter constructs, 3kbLacZ, D300LacZ, and D170LacZ (Fig. 1A). 3kbLacZ contains 3 kilobases of the rat Grp78 promoter driving the expression of the LacZ reporter gene. D300LacZ contains a 230-bp internal deletion spanning from -300 to -70, which eliminates the known ER stress-inducible elements of the Grp78 promoter, including both the ERSE and the cAMP-response element (CRE). For D170LacZ, the internal deletion was narrowed down to a 100-bp region spanning -170 to -70, which eliminates primarily the three tandem copies of the ERSE. Previously, in NIH3T3 cells, it was confirmed that 3kbLacZ is inducible by ER stress, whereas the induction was substantially suppressed in D170LacZ and completely abolished in D300LacZ (21Luo S. Baumeister P. Yang S. Abcouwer S.F. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37375-37385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For each construct, 2-5 independent TG mouse lines were generated and analyzed. Embryos and organs of adult mice from transgenic mice and their nontransgenic (non-TG) siblings were stained for β-galactosidase activity. For the 3kbLacZ TG mouse, β-galactosidase activity was strongly detected in the heart and to a lesser extent in other tissues, such as the somites and neural tube during early embryonic development (E9.5-E11.5) (Fig. 1, B-D) (data not shown). As a negative control, no β-galactosidase activity was detected in non-TG E11.5 siblings (Fig. 1E). For the D300LacZ mice, no β-galactosidase activity was detected at E11.5 or other stages during embryonic development (Fig. 1F) (data not shown). The LacZ transgene directed by D300 is functional, since strong β-galactosidase activity was detected in the hypothalamus of the adult mice and not in the non-TG sibling control (Fig. 1G). The Grp78 promoter region required for heart expression is further narrowed down to the 100-bp region containing the ERSEs, since the reporter activity of D170LacZ is completely quiescent from E9.5 to E11.5 (Fig. 1H) (data not shown). D170LacZ in the TG mice is functional, since LacZ activity can be detected in preimplantation embryos (data not shown). Identical results were observed in multiple, independently derived transgenic mouse lines for all three constructs. These results provide the first evidence that the in vivo induction of Grp78 transcription during early mouse organogenesis, in particular the embryonic heart, is mediated largely through the ERSEs. Grp78 Transcription Is Activated in Early Embryonic Cardiomyocytes but Subsides Later in Development—To obtain a clearer view of the β-galactosidase staining pattern of 3kbLacZ, E11.5 embryos were dehydrated in methanol and cleared in 2:1 benzyl benzoate/benzyl alcohol after whole mount β-galactosidase staining. As shown in Fig. 2A, β-galactosidase activity was most intense at the heart, with activity also detected in the somites. To obtain higher resolution of the β-galactosidase expression pattern, plastic sections of the embryos after β-galactosidase staining were prepared, and images were taken under dark field conditions where the β-galactosidase staining turned to a pink color (Fig. 2B). It is evident that the heart showed high β-galactosidase activity. The LacZ staining is predominant in the trabeculae, and at higher magnification, a majority of the staining was observed in cardiomyocytes (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, β-galactosidase staining was visible in other organs, such as the mandibular component. Within the developing embryonic heart, β-galactosidase staining was clearly detected in the myocytes of both the atrium and the ventricle of the embryonic heart (Fig. 2C). To determine directly whether transcription of the endogenous Grp78 gene is induced in the embryonic mouse heart, as predicted from the reporter gene approach, a Northern blot was performed with RNA extracted from whole embryo, heart, brain, or somites of E11.5 embryos of non-TG siblings. In agreement with the β-galactosidase staining data, the level of Grp78 transcript was highest in the embryonic heart (Fig. 2D, lanes 1-4). Thus, endogenous Grp78 transcription correlates with LacZ reporter gene activity driven by the Grp78 promoter. To determine whether Grp78 transcription is sustained later in development and in postnatal mice, an additional Northern blot was performed with RNA extracted from whole embryos at E9.5-E14.5 or from hearts of E18 embryos or 3-month-old mice. We observed that, compared with embryonic tissues, Grp78 transcript level was dramatically reduced in the heart tissue of E18 embryos and in 3-month-old mice (Fig. 2E, lanes 1-5). This is in agreement with our observation that β-galactosidase staining in 3kbLacZ mice was below the detection limit in the E18 embryonic heart as well as the heart of adult mice (25Dong D. Dubeau L. Bading J. Nguyen K. Luna M. Yu H. Gazit-Bornstein G. Gordon E.M. Gomer C. Hall F.L. Gambhir S. Lee A.S. Hum. Gene. Ther. 2004; 15: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (data not shown). LacZ Reporter Activity Driven by the ATF6α Promoter Is Widely Expressed in Developing Embryos—Since high level expression of the Grp78 promoter during early organogenesis requires the ERSE, it is possible that the Grp78 induction is mediated by transcription factors known to bind and activate the ERSE. These include ATF6, XBP-1, and YY1, and in tissue culture systems, these transcription factors are able to activate the Grp78 promoter in a manner dependent on the ERSE. There are two forms of ATF6, α and β, encoded by two different genes, both of which are processed by ER stress to yield an active, N-terminal protein (31Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The ATF6/βgeo mice created through gene trap generate an ATF6α fusion protein driven by the endogenous ATF6 promoter (26Skarnes W.C. Moss J.E. Hurtley S.M. Beddington R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This fusion protein contains 601 amino acids of ATF6 linked to β-galactosidase and neomycin transferase (Fig. 3A). Western blot performed with anti-ATF6 antibody on protein extracts from embryonic fibroblasts of wild-type and ATF6/βgeo homozygous mice confirmed the expression of a 220-kDa ATF6 fusion protein in the ATF6/βgeo strain, in contrast to the 90-kDa protein in the non-TG sibling (Fig. 3B). As expected, the 220-kDa protein was also detected by antibody against β-galactosidase (data not shown). Thus, the ATF6/βgeo mouse provides a useful reporter system to examine the expression pattern of ATF6α during embryonic development. To compare with the Grp78 expression pattern, E9.75 and E11.5 embryos from the ATF6/βgeo mouse were stained for β-galactosidase activity. In whole mount as well as dehydrated, alcohol-clarified embryos, the β-galactosidase activity driven by the ATF6α promoter was ubiquitously and highly expressed in the whole embryo (Fig. 3C and data not shown). Expression of endogenous ATF6α transcripts in the heart, brain, and somites in E11.5 embryos was confirmed using RT-PCR (Fig. 3D). Previously, in situ hybridization experiments showed that YY1 is ubiquitously expressed during early organogenesis (E7.5-E12.5) (11Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Through RT-PCR, we confirmed that the YY1 transcript level was readily detectable in the heart, brain, and somites of E11.5 embryos (Fig. 3D). Our results also showed that despite the high level of XBP-1 mRNA expression in these embryonic tissues, no XBP-1 mRNA splicing was detected (Fig. 3E, lanes 3-5). As a positive control, XBP-1 mRNA was spliced in NIH3T3 cells treated with the ER stress inducer thapsigargin (Fig. 3E, lanes 1 and 2). Collectively, these results show that ATF6α and YY1 are ubiquitously expressed in mouse embryos during early organogenesis. Whereas they can contribute to Grp78 induction through activation of the ERSE, it is possible that specific, high level expression of Grp78 in the developing heart is further facilitated by heart-specific transcription factors in these stages, either directly or through functional interactions with YY1 or ATF6α. GATA-4 Binds to the Grp78 Promoter in Vivo and Activates the Promoter through the ERSE—One such candidate is GATA-4, a transcription factor highly active in the embryonic heart and a known interactive partner of YY1 in promoter activation (19Bhalla S.S. Robitaille L. Nemer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11439-11445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Within the 100-bp region deleted in D170LacZ, which results in elimination of reporter gene activity in the developing heart, we did not detect any consensus GATA sequence; thus, there is no obvious high affinity site for GATA-4 within the ERSE region. To examine the possibility that GATA-4 can bind the Grp78 through indirect interactions as has been reported for other promoters, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed with human embryonic kidney 293T cells transiently transfected with an expression plasmid"
https://openalex.org/W2054017406,"Considerable evidence indicates that the Escherichia coli signal recognition particle (SRP) selectively targets proteins that contain highly hydrophobic signal peptides to the SecYEG complex cotranslationally. Presecretory proteins that contain only moderately hydrophobic signal peptides typically interact with trigger factor (TF) and are targeted post-translationally. Here we describe a striking exception to this rule that has emerged from the analysis of an unusual 55-amino acid signal peptide associated with the E. coli autotransporter EspP. The EspP signal peptide consists of a C-terminal domain that resembles a classical signal peptide plus an N-terminal extension that is conserved in other autotransporter signal peptides. Although a previous study showed that proteins containing the C-terminal domain of the EspP signal peptide are targeted cotranslationally by SRP, we found that proteins containing the full-length signal peptide were targeted post-translationally via a novel TF-independent mechanism. Mutation of an invariant asparagine residue in the N-terminal extension, however, restored cotranslational targeting. Remarkably, proteins containing extremely hydrophobic derivatives of the EspP signal peptide were also targeted post-translationally. These and other results suggest that the N-terminal extension alters the accessibility of the signal peptide to SRP and TF and promotes post-translational export by reducing the efficiency of the interaction between the signal peptide and the SecYEG complex. Based on data, we propose that the N-terminal extension mediates an interaction with an unidentified cytoplasmic factor or induces the formation of an unusual signal peptide conformation prior to the onset of protein translocation.

The vast majority of bacterial presecretory proteins contain a ∼20–25-amino acid cleaved signal peptide that earmarks them for translocation across the inner membrane (IM) 3The abbreviations used are: IM, inner membrane; CTABr, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide; HA, influenza hemagglutinin epitope HA.11; IPTG, isopropylthiogalactoside; MBP, maltose-binding protein; OM, outer membrane; SRP, signal recognition particle; SPATE, serine protease autotransporter of E. coli and Shigella; TF, trigger factor; TPS, two-partner secretion. 3The abbreviations used are: IM, inner membrane; CTABr, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide; HA, influenza hemagglutinin epitope HA.11; IPTG, isopropylthiogalactoside; MBP, maltose-binding protein; OM, outer membrane; SRP, signal recognition particle; SPATE, serine protease autotransporter of E. coli and Shigella; TF, trigger factor; TPS, two-partner secretion. via a highly conserved heterotrimeric protein-conducting channel called the SecYEG complex. Although signal peptides are extremely degenerate, they typically consist of a basic N region, a core of 7–12 hydrophobic amino acids (H region), and a somewhat polar C region (1von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). In E. coli, a few cleaved signal peptides are recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein complex (reviewed in Ref. 2Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). E. coli SRP interacts predominantly with extremely hydrophobic signal peptides, although positive charges in the N region may also influence SRP recognition (3deGier J.-W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A.

SRP binds to its substrates as they emerge from translating ribosomes and then targets ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the IM cotranslationally. Most presecretory proteins, however, are bypassed by SRP and are engaged instead by a ribosome-associated chaperone called trigger factor (TF), which also binds at an early stage of translation but does not interact with the signal peptide (7Valent Q.A.

The binding of both SRP and TF to very short nascent chains is likely facilitated by their interaction with a ribosomal subunit (L23) that is directly adjacent to the ribosomal tunnel (9Ullers R.S.

TF binding promotes post-translational targeting, possibly by sterically hindering the docking of ribosomes onto the Sec complex (12Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43527-43535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Eisner G. Koch H.G. Beck K. Brunner J. Muller M. J.

Recent evidence suggests that SecA, a cytoplasmic ATPase that plays a central role in the translocation reaction, may also bind to short nascent presecretory proteins (13Eisner G. Koch H.G. Beck K. Brunner J. Muller M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Karamyshev A.L. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37930-37940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Other chaperones such as SecB bind to presecretory proteins late during translation or after translation is complete (16Randall L.L. Topping T.B. Hardy S.J. Pavlov M.Y. Freistroffer D.V. Ehrenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These factors are required to maintain presecretory proteins in a loosely folded conformation that is required for translocation across the IM and to keep the signal peptide exposed to gate open the Sec complex (17Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The signal peptide itself may also play a role in preventing the premature folding of presecretory proteins (18Park S. Liu G. Topping T.B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L. Science. 1988; 239: 1033-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Although the superfamily of bacterial proteins known as autotransporters are translocated across the IM via the Sec pathway (20Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Bernstein H.D. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), some of them contain unusual signal peptides. Autotransporters are comprised of a large (often >100 kDa) N-terminal passenger domain that typically mediates a virulence function and a C-terminal ∼30 kDa β-domain (reviewed in Ref. 21Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Desvaux M. Fernandez R.C. Ala'Aldeen A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 692-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). After an autotransporter is translocated across the IM, the β-domain integrates into the outer membrane (OM) and facilitates transport of the passenger domain across the membrane by an unknown mechanism. The passenger domains of some autotransporters are then cleaved from the cell surface. About 10% of autotransporters contain signal peptides that exceed 50 amino acids in length. Although there is no obvious correlation between the presence of a long signal peptide and the effector function of the passenger domain, long signal peptides are associated with all members of one autotransporter family, the serine protease autotransporters of E. coli and Shigella (SPATEs). The C-terminal half of the long autotransporter signal peptides resembles a classical signal peptide in that it contains well defined N, H, and C regions but otherwise shows high sequence variability. The only distinguishing feature of this segment is an uncommonly high net positive charge in the N region. A recent study confirmed that the C-terminal half of the signal peptide of a SPATE produced by E. coli O157:H7 called EspP can act as an independent targeting signal (6Peterson J.H. Woolhead C.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46155-46162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). (This fragment of the EspP signal peptide was previously designated ΔEspP, but is referred to here as EspP(C)SP (see Fig. 1)). Interestingly, the N-terminal 25 amino acids of the long autotransporter signal peptides contain a unique, highly conserved sequence motif(MNKIYX(Hy)X(Hy)X6(Hy)(V/I)(V/A)VSEL(A/S)R), where Hy is a large hydrophobic amino acid (22Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Closely related N-terminal extensions are also found on the signal peptides of a subset of proteins that are secreted via the two partner secretion (TPS) pathway (23Jacob-Dubuisson F. Locht C. Antoine R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Proteins secreted by the TPS pathway are transported across the OM by dedicated, coordinately expressed translocators and also tend to be very large.The significance of the signal peptide extension is not entirely clear, although its uniqueness and high sequence conservation suggest that it has an important function. Because bacteria utilize multiple pathways to target proteins to the SecYEG complex, it is conceivable that the unusual segment dictates targeting pathway selection. Indeed it is possible that the long signal peptides route autotransporters into the SRP pathway to ensure that they do not fold prematurely into a translocation-incompetent conformation in the cytoplasm. Consistent with this hypothesis, one study showed that the signal peptide of a SPATE called Hbp can be cross-linked efficiently to the protein subunit of SRP (Ffh) in vitro and that perturbations of the SRP pathway slightly inhibit Hbp secretion in vivo (20Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Bernstein H.D. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, heterologous proteins containing EspP(C)SP appear to be targeted to the IM by SRP (6Peterson J.H. Woolhead C.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46155-46162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, the export of the Shigella flexneri autotransporter IcsA did not appear to require SRP (24Brandon L.D. Goehring N. Janakiraman A. Yan A.W. Wu T. Beckwith J. Goldberg M.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and a truncated version of FHA, a Bordetella pertussis protein secreted by the TPS pathway that also contains an extended signal peptide, required SecB for efficient export (25Chevalier N. Moser M. Koch H.-G. Schimz K.-L. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Müller M. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 8: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study demonstrated that efficient translocation of EspP across the IM does not require an unusual signal peptide (26Szabady R.L. Peterson J.H. Skillman K.M. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Remarkably, this study showed that the native EspP signal peptide was required primarily to prevent misfolding of the protein in the periplasm. The data suggested that the signal peptide transits slowly through the SecYEG complex and thereby prevents non-productive folding of the passenger domain by transiently tethering it to the periplasmic side of the IM.Given the conflicting evidence on the role of the unusual autotransporter signal in specifying a targeting pathway, we decided to reevaluate the targeting of EspP and heterologous proteins that contain the EspP signal peptide under physiological conditions. Even though EspP(C)SP was clearly shown in a previous study to promote cotranslational targeting (6Peterson J.H. Woolhead C.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46155-46162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we found that the full-length EspP signal peptide (EspPSP, Fig. 1) promotes post-translational targeting. Several lines of evidence indicated that the signal peptide extension routed presecretory proteins into a post-translational targeting pathway by exerting an unprecedented inhibitory effect on their interaction with SRP, TF, and the SecYEG complex. The observation that mutation of a nearly invariant residue in the N-terminal extension largely restored cotranslational targeting showed that this effect was due specifically to the presence of the conserved sequence motif. To account for the data, we propose that the N-terminal extension of EspPSP either recruits a novel cytoplasmic factor that mediates a post-translational targeting reaction or causes the signal peptide to adopt an unusual conformation in which it has reduced affinity for the translocation machinery.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntisera, Media, and Bacterial Strains—An antiserum generated against an N-terminal peptide of EspP has been previously described (26Szabady R.L. Peterson J.H. Skillman K.M. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antisera against maltose-binding protein (MBP) and the influenza hemagglutinin epitope HA.11 (HA) were obtained from New England Biolabs and Covance, respectively. Selective media contained 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol as required. Unless otherwise noted, experiments were conducted at 37 °C. The E. coli K-12 strains used in this study were MC4100 (27Casadaban M.J. J. Mol.

Plasmid Construction—The following plasmids have been described previously: pJH28, which encodes malE, pJH28.1, which encodes the MBP*1 derivative of malE, pHL36, which encodes an HA-tagged version of ompA, pJH46, which encodes an HA-tagged version of ompA containing the full-length EspP signal peptide, pJH47, which encodes malE containing the full-length EspP signal peptide, pRLS6, which encodes wild-type espP and pRLS11, which encodes espP with a non-cleavable passenger domain (4Lee H.C.

An NheI-Hind III fragment of pJH42 (12Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3904) Google Scholar) to create plasmid pJH44. Plasmids encoding ompA with the EspP (N2A), EspP (A30P/T31P), EspP (L47T), and EspP (Hydro′) signal peptides (pJH80, pJH81, pJH82, and pJH83, respectively) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pJH46 using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGAGGCGCAACATATGGCTAAAATATACTCTC-3′, 5′-CCGGCAGAGTATCATCAAGACCACCTGGTAAGAA-3′, 5′-GCATTATGTTTTTTAGGCACATTACAATCCTCATA-3′ and 5′-CACAAACGCATACTTGCATTATTATTTTTACTCTTATTACAATCCTCATATTC-3′(EspP 2L) and their complements. A plasmid encoding ompA with the EspP (Hydro″) signal peptide (pJH84) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pJH83 using the oligonucleotide 5′-TTATTTTTACTCTTATTAATGTTTCAATCCTCATATTCTTTTGCGGCCG-3′ and its complement. Plasmid pJH86, which encodes ompA with the EspP (–6) signal peptide was made by first mutagenizing pJH46 using the oligonucleotide 5′-GAGCAACTGGTAAGAAAAAACAGCAACAGATACTTGCATTATG-3′ and its complement to generate pJH85. Subsequently pJH85 was mutagenized using the oligonucleotide 5′-CAAGAGCAACTGGTCAGCAACAACAGCAACAGATACTTGC-3′ and its complement. Plasmids encoding espP with the EspP (N2A) and EspP (–6) signal peptides (pJH87 and pJH88) were generated by digesting pJH80 and pJH86 with NdeI and EagI and ligating the small fragment containing the signal peptide to pRLS6 digested with the same enzymes. Plasmids encoding malE with the EspP (N2A) and EspP (Hydro′) signal peptides (pJH89 and pJH90, respectively) were made by site-directed mutagenesis of pJH47 using the oligonucleotides 5′-CCAACAAGGACCATAGCATATGGCTAAAATATACTCTC-3′, and EspP 2L and their complements. A plasmid encoding malE with the EspP (Hydro″) signal peptide (pJH91) was made by mutagenizing pJH90 using the oligonucleotide 5′-TTATTTTTACTCTTATTAATGTTTCAATCCTCATATTCTTTTGCGTCAC-3′and its complement. All mutations were made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Pulse-Chase and Cell Fractionation Experiments—For most experiments, cells were grown in M9 containing 0.2% glycerol and all the l-amino acids except methionine and cysteine. In experiments in which a secB–strain was used, cells were grown in M9 containing 0.2% glucose. Overnight cultures were washed and diluted into fresh medium at an absorbance (A550) = 0.02 (for EspP) or 0.025 (for OmpA and MBP). Unless otherwise noted, synthesis of plasmid-borne polypeptides was induced by the addition of isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) at a concentration of 50 μm (for OmpA and MBP) or 100 μm (for EspP) when the cultures reached A550 = 0.2. In temperature-shift experiments, cultures were shifted from 37 to 22 °C when they reached A550 = 0.2 and grown for an additional 40 min before the addition of IPTG. In TF overproduction experiments, 0.2% arabinose was added when cultures reached A550 = 0.2, and IPTG was added 30 min later. Pulse-chase labeling was conducted as previously described (30Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) 20 min (for OmpA and MBP) or 30 min (for EspP) after the addition of IPTG. Sodium azide (2 mm) was added 2 min prior to labeling where indicated. In Ffh depletion experiments, overnight cultures were washed and diluted to A550 = 0.005 in M9 supplemented with 18 amino acids and 0.2% fructose and either 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% d-glucose. IPTG (50 μm for MBP or 100 μm for EspP) was added when cultures reached A550 = 0.15, and cells were radiolabeled 30 min later. In general, radiolabeled aliquots were removed from each culture and immediately mixed with cold trichloroacetic acid to precipitate proteins. In cell fractionation experiments, radiolabeled cells were first poured over ice, and all subsequent steps were conducted at 0–4 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min and converted to spheroplasts as described (30Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). After the addition of 10 mm MgSO4, spheroplasts were pelleted at 16,500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant, which contained the contents of the periplasm, was discarded. Spheroplasts were then resuspended in 80 μl of 33 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 40% sucrose and lysed by the addition of 3.2 ml of H2O. Unbroken spheroplasts were removed by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min. Subsequently the spheroplast lysate (designated “total” in these experiments) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to obtain cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. Proteins in each fraction were collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation.Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were solubilized, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described (30Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In experiments that involved production of EspP or one of its derivatives, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 15 × 15 cm 4–10% gradient gels. In all other experiments, proteins were resolved on 8–16% minigels (Novex). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a Fuji BAS-2500 PhosphorImager, and percent precursor was calculated as previously described (31Siegel V. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In experiments in which the biogenesis of EspP was monitored, the data were quantitated using an analogous method. The intensity of the prepro-EspP, pro-EspP, and passenger domain bands was first normalized to take into account differences in the number of radioactive amino acids. The percent of the protein in each band was then calculated by dividing the normalized intensity of that band by the sum of the normalized intensities of all of the bands and multiplying by 100.RESULTSProteins Containing EspPSP Are Targeted to the IM Post-translationally but Do Not Interact with TF—In initial experiments, we sought to determine whether EspP is translocated across the IM by the SecYEG complex. HDB114 transformed with pRLS6, a plasmid that encodes wild-type espP under the control of the trc promoter, was grown in M9 minimal medium. After the addition of IPTG to induce espP expression, cells were subjected to pulse-chase labeling in the presence or absence of sodium azide, a compound that blocks Sec-dependent protein translocation. Prepro-EspP, the form of EspP that contains the signal peptide, pro-EspP, the leaderless form of EspP that contains linked passenger and β-domains, and the free passenger domain were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-peptide antiserum raised against an N-terminal peptide. Consistent with previous results (26Szabady R.L. Peterson J.H. Skillman K.M. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), in the absence of azide, prepro-EspP was rapidly converted to pro-EspP, and the passenger domain was then excised from pro-EspP after its translocation across the OM (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–5). In contrast, the addition of azide caused a profound defect in EspP biogenesis and led to the accumulation of prepro-EspP (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–10). These results confirmed that EspP is translocated across the IM in a Sec-dependent fashion despite the presence of an unusual signal peptide.FIGURE 2EspP is targeted to the Sec complex post-translationally. A, HDB114 (MC4100 ompT::kan) transformed with pRLS6 (Ptrc-espP) was grown in M9, and expression of the plasmid-borne gene was induced with IPTG. Cells were subjected to pulse-chase labeling in the presence or absence of sodium azide (NaN3) and EspP-containing polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with an N-terminal antipeptide antiserum. The length of the chase is indicated. Lanes 1–5, no azide added (–NaN3); lanes 6–10, azide added (+NaN3). B, the experiment described in A was repeated except that cells were pulse-labeled in the absence of azide and fractionated. T, total spheroplast extract; C, cytoplasm; M, membranes. C, HDB114 and HDB116 (HDB114 lon– clpP– clpQ–) were transformed with a derivative of pRLS6 encoding a passenger domain cleavage mutant (espP*) and grown as described above. Cells were subjected to pulse-chase labeling after the addition of IPTG and EspP-containing polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with the N-terminal antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, evidence that EspP is targeted to the IM post-translationally emerged from these experiments. Because signal peptides are usually removed by leader peptidase before completion of protein synthesis during cotranslational translocation, the observation that ∼20–30% of the pulse-labeled protein was in the prepro form in untreated cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1) was by itself diagnostic of post-translational targeting. To rule out the possibility that the appearance of the precursor was simply caused by unusually slow cleavage of the signal peptide, we performed cell fractionation experiments using pulse-labeled cells. The finding that almost all of the prepro form of the protein was in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B) provided direct evidence that at least some of the protein was completely synthesized before it was targeted to the IM. Furthermore, two additional observations suggested that the prepro-EspP found in untreated cells was an intermediate in EspP biogenesis and not a misfolded form of the protein that was rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm. First, prepro-EspP did not appear to be a prime target for cytoplasmic proteases because it was stable in azide-treated cells for >10 min (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–10). Second, elimination of cytoplasmic proteases that have been implicated in the degradation of misfolded proteins did not increase the half-life of prepro-EspP. This conclusion was derived from pulse-chase experiments in which HDB114 and HDB116, a strain that lacks Lon and both Clp proteases, were transformed with pRLS11, a plasmid encoding a version of EspP that contains a non-cleavable passenger domain (EspP*). In both strains prepro-EspP* was observed at early time points, but disappeared at later timepoints (Fig. 2C). Taken together, the data imply that at least 20–30% of the protein was targeted post-translationally. Because the synthesis and targeting of some of the protein was completed early in the pulse-labeling period; however, it is possible that a much higher fraction of the protein was targeted post-translationally.To obtain further evidence that EspPSP promotes post-translational targeting, we next replaced the native signal peptide of OmpA with EspPSP and examined the export kinetics of the resulting chimera (EspPSP-OmpA). OmpA was chosen as a model largely because interactions between both the wild-type protein and a variety of deriva"

In this study, we have identified a Mycobacterium smegmatis gene, termed lpqW, that is required for the conversion of PIMs to LAM and is highly conserved in all mycobacteria. A transposon mutant, Myco481, containing an insertion near the 3′ end of lpqW exhibited altered colony morphology on complex agar medium. This mutant was unstable and was consistently overgrown by a second mutant, represented by Myco481.1, that had normal growth and colony characteristics. Biochemical analysis and metabolic labeling studies showed that Myco481 synthesized the complete spectrum of apolar and polar PIMs but was unable to make LAM. LAM biosynthesis was restored to near wild type levels in Myco481.1. However, this mutant was unable to synthesize the major polar PIM (AcPIM6) and accumulated a smaller intermediate, AcPIM4. Targeted disruption of the lpqW gene and complementation of the initial Myco481 mutant with the wild type gene confirmed that the phenotype of this mutant was due to loss of LpqW.

Members of the genus Mycobacterium cause important diseases in humans, including tuberculosis and leprosy. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is thought to infect nearly one-third of the world population and to cause two to three million deaths each year (1Raviglione M.C. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2003; 83: 4-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This threat to global health is growing as drug-resistant strains emerge and coinfections with human immunodeficiency virus increase the number of individuals with active tuberculosis. All species of mycobacteria synthesize a highly distinctive cell wall that contributes to the ability of pathogenic mycobacteria to survive within the endosomal network of human macrophages and to their innate resistance to many antibiotics. The mycobacterial cell wall has a multilaminate structure, comprising an asymmetric outer membrane and an inner layer of arabinogalactan polysaccharide and peptidoglycan (2Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Daffe M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The asymmetric outer membrane has an inner leaflet of tightly packed, long chain (C70–C90) mycolic acids and an outer leaflet of free (glyco)lipids. This asymmetric outer membrane is responsible for the low permeability properties of the cell wall and also contains lipids that play key roles in the pathogenesis of these organisms. Although the (glyco)lipid composition of the mycobacterial cell wall can vary among mycobacterial species, all species synthesize an abundant class of phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) 7The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIM, PI mannoside; AcPIM, acyl PIM; LM, lipomannan; LAM, lipoarabinomannan; DXO, double crossover mutants; MS, mass spectrometry; GC-MS, gas chromatography-MS; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; PPM, polyprenol mannose; PPLO, pleuropneumonia-like organism medium. and the hypermannosylated PIMs, lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) (4Nigou J.

These studies indicate that PIMs and/or LAM fulfill fundamental roles in cell wall biogenesis and cell division. Considerable progress has been made in delineating the steps and some of the genes involved in PIM/LAM biosynthesis.

The two mannose residues are transferred from GDP-Man by PimA and PimB, which may be associated with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane (9Kordulakova J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G.

AcPIM2 can accumulate as an end product or be further modified with a second acyl chain and/or additional mannose residues to form polar PIM species, such as AcPIM6 or LM and LAM (Fig. 1).

Although AcPIM4 appears to represent a possible branch point intermediate in polar PIM and LM/LAM biosynthesis, very little is known about the enzymes or other proteins that regulate the flux of early PIM intermediates into polar PIMs or LM/LAM. The relative abundance of these components appears to be maintained over a wide range of growth conditions, suggesting that the synthesis of PIM and LM/LAM is tightly controlled. Screening of libraries of M. smegmatis transposon mutants for alterations in colony morphology has resulted in the identification of several genes involved in the synthesis of outer layer glycolipids (15Billman-Jacobe H. Mc Conville M.J. Haites R.E. Kovacevic S. Coppel R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Patterson J.H. McConville M.J. Haites R.E. Coppel R.L.

In this study, we describe the isolation of two M. smegmatis transposon insertion mutants that exhibit novel defects in polar PIM and LAM biosynthesis. The first of these mutants has a defect in LAM biosynthesis but expresses normal levels of polar PIMs. This mutant is unstable in complex medium, giving rise to the second mutant with normal LAM but altered polar PIM profiles. The phenotypes of these mutants were due to loss of function of the lpqW gene, which is present in the genomes of all mycobacteria sequenced to date. We present evidence that the product of this gene plays a role in regulating the conversion of AcPIM4 to more polar PIM species or LAM. This study demonstrates that LAM and polar PIM biosynthesis can be independently regulated. Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Recombinant DNA Methods—M. smegmatis mc2155 (17Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) and derivative strains were routinely grown in Middlebrook 7H9 or 7H10 media (Difco) with the addition of DC (dextrose-NaCl). Complex media used were LB (Tryptone 10 g/liter, yeast extract 5 g/liter, NaCl 10 g/liter) and PPLO (brain-heart infusion 50 g/liter, peptone 10 g/liter, NaCl 5 g/liter) in 1% w/v agar and BY (beef-yeast) media (0.3% w/v beef extract, 0.6% w/v yeast extract, 1.2% w/v peptone, 1% w/v NaCl, 1.5% w/v agar). Sauton's minimal medium was used in labeling assays (18Sauton B. C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. 1912; 92: 85-93Google Scholar). Kanamycin, streptomycin, or hygromycin were added to media at 100 μg/ml as required. Transposon mutants were cultivated at 39 °C, and all other bacteria were grown at 37 °C. Cloning procedures were performed according to standard protocols (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electrotransformation was performed using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser using Escherichia coli cells prepared for transformation according to the manufacturer's recommendations or M. smegmatis cells prepared according to Jacobs et al. (20Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kalpana G.V. Cirillo J.D. Pascopella L. Snapper S.B. Udani R.A. Jones W. Barletta R.G. Bloom B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted from mycobacteria as described previously (21Jeevarajah D. Patterson J.H. Taig E. Sargeant T. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6792-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Probes for Southern blotting were labeled with digoxygenin-labeled dNTPs using a digoxygenin labeling kit (Roche Applied Science), and membranes were developed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Restriction endonucleases and DNA modification enzymes were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All PCR amplifications and sequencing cycles were carried out using a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (Bresatech Pty. Ltd.). Sequencing products were analyzed on an ABI 373A automated fluorescent sequencing apparatus (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Sequencher™ Version 3.0 (Gene Codes Corp.) and BLAST algorithms (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) were used to analyze DNA sequences. Isolation of lpqW::Tn611 Mutants—A library of Tn611 mutants of M. smegmatis was prepared as described previously (15Billman-Jacobe H. Mc Conville M.J. Haites R.E. Kovacevic S. Coppel R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) except that the mutant library was plated on beef-yeast agar. A mutant strain that formed small colonies (0.5–1 mm diameter) was isolated. This mutant, Myco481, rapidly reverted to the normal sized (2–3 mm diameter) colony upon subculture, and one of the normal sized variants was isolated and named Myco481.1. Both Myco481 and the variant (Myco481.1) formed normal sized colonies on Middlebrook 7H10 agar and only differed from each other on complex media such as beef-yeast, LB, or PPLO; therefore, Middlebrook media were used for all subsequent analyses. Construction of an M. smegmatis lpqW::aphA3 Mutant by Gene Replacement—A new lpqW– mutant was created by directed gene replacement to confirm that the phenotype was related to the Tn disruption of lpqW in Myco481. The procedure for gene replacement used an allelic exchange cassette comprised of a 2.5-kb fragment of M. smegmatis genomic DNA with the lpqW gene centrally located. The lpqW gene was disrupted at an internal HindIII site with a kanamycin resistance marker, aphA3. The vector carrying the allelic exchange cassette carried sacB and a streptomycin resistance marker and cannot replicate in mycobacteria (21Jeevarajah D. Patterson J.H. Taig E. Sargeant T. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6792-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The plasmid, pHBJ508, was introduced into M. smegmatis mc2155 by electrotransformation, and transformants were recovered on Middlebrook 7H10 agar containing kanamycin and streptomycin at 37 °C. One transformant was grown without antibiotics for 3 days (Middlebrook 7H9 broth, 37 °C) and then plated on medium with kanamycin and 10% w/v sucrose. Putative double crossover mutants (DXO; kanamycin-resistant, streptomycin-sensitive, sucrose-resistant) were streaked out to purity and then grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth for 3 days. Aliquots of the broth cultures were stored at –70 °C and used as the inocula for subsequent experiments. Disruption of lpqW in the DXO mutant was confirmed by Southern blotting. The DXO mutant was named Myco721. This mutant produced small colonies on complex medium and rapidly converted to a normal sized colony variant. A variant was isolated for further analysis and was named Myco721.1. A plasmid was constructed to complement the lpqW mutation. The plasmid contained the entire lpqW open reading frame under the control of the GroEL promoter on pVV16 (gift of T. Eckstein). The complementation plasmid, pHBJ212, was transferred to Myco721 by transformation. Extraction and Analysis of PIMs and LAM—PIMs were extracted from mycobacterial cell pellets in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and chloroform:methanol:water (1:2:0.8 v/v), and dried extracts were resolved by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) as described previously (15Billman-Jacobe H. Mc Conville M.J. Haites R.E. Kovacevic S. Coppel R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Individual PIM species were purified by scraping silica from preparative HPTLC sheets and extracted in chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3, v/v). HPTLC-purified PIMs were analyzed by electrospray ionization-MS and MALDI-TOF-MS as described previously (12Morita Y.S. Patterson J.H. Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LAM was extracted from delipidated pellets by reflux (3×) in 50% (v/v) ethanol (100 °C, 2 h), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). The combined extracts were dried under N2, and the LAM/LM was purified by octyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. Samples in 0.1 m NH4O(CO)CH3, 5% (v/v) 1-propanol were loaded onto a small column (500 μl) of octyl-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 0.1 m NH4O(CO)CH3 containing 5% 1-propanol, and the bound LAM/LM was eluted in 30, 40, and 50% (w/v) 1-propanol. Extracts from 150 mg (wet weight) of cells were run on SDS-PAGE gels and silver-periodic acid-stained. The monosaccharide compositions of purified LAM/LM fractions were determined after hydrolysis in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid (2 h, 100 °C), and conversion of the released monosaccharides to their alditol acetate derivatives by reduction in NaBD4 and acetylation in acetic anhydride using 1-methyl-imidazole as a catalyst (22Henry R.J. Blakeney A.B. Harris P.J. Stone B.A. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 256: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was determined. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed using an Agilent 6890-5973 GC-MS system and an HP-1 column. Samples (1 μl) were injected in splitless mode, and the column was held at 80 °C for 1 min, ramped at 30 °C min–1 to 140 °C and then at 5 °C min–1 to 250 °C, and held at 250 °C for 20 min. Metabolic Labeling—Mid-exponential phase cultures of wild type and mutant M. smegmatis (25 ml) were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in Sauton's medium, and resuspended in 1 ml of prewarmed Sauton's medium (39 °C, 15 min) with shaking. Cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]mannose (50 μCi; 17 Ci/mmol of specific activity, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 10 min and then diluted with 5 ml of prewarmed Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco). Samples (1 ml) were removed at indicated times during this “chase” period, and PIMs were extracted as described above. Labeled lipids were resolved by HPTLC and detected either with an TLC linear analyzer (Berthold) or by fluorography after coating HPTLC sheets with EA scintillant wax (EA Biotech Ltd.) and exposure to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at –70 °C. LAM was extracted from the delipidated pellets as described above. Radioactivity in the combined 30–40% 1-propanol fractions was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Incorporation of [3H]Man into LAM was normalized to cell weight, and the results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Phenotype of a lpqW– Mutant—The M. smegmatis transposon mutant, Myco481, was isolated from a library of Tn611 mutants on the basis that it formed unusual, small (0.5–1 mm diameter) colonies on complex agar medium, such as beef-yeast and PPLO (Fig. 2A). This mutant was consistently found to be unstable when cultured on complex media, and colonies of the same size as wild type M. smegmatis mc2155 (2–3 mm diameter) appeared after subculturing on complex medium (Fig. 2A). One of the normal sized variants was isolated and named Myco481.1. The colony size was dependent on medium composition, and both Myco481 and Myco481.1 formed normal sized colonies on Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Fig. 2A) but could be differentiated on PPLO agar. Myco481 cultured on 7H10 agar consistently formed small colonies when subcultured on PPLO agar, suggesting that the rate of reversion was slower or happened much less frequently in Middlebrook medium than complex medium. Southern blotting of digested genomic DNA of both Myco481 and Myco481.1 using an IS6100 probe showed the three bands typical of a single copy of Tn611, indicating that the Tn was inserted in the same place in each strain (23Guilhot C. Otal I. Vanrompaey I. Martin C. Gicquel B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 535-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The site of Tn611 insertion in each strain was also determined using ligation-mediated PCR (24Prod'hom G. Lagier B. Pelicic V. Hance A.J. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 158: 75-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and marker rescue (16Patterson J.H. McConville M.J. Haites R.E. Coppel R.L. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24900-24906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The data showed that both Myco481 and the variant, Myco481.1, had a single copy of Tn611 inserted in identical positions in an open reading frame that is similar to Rv1166 of M. tuberculosis that has been designated as lpqW because it is predicted to encode a lipoprotein (26Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornby T. Jagels K. Krogh A. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6550) Google Scholar). Disruption of the gene downstream of lpqW did not affect PIM/LAM synthesis, showing that the lpqW mutation did not cause polar genetic effects (27Rawat M. Kovacevic S. Billman-Jacobe H. Av-Gay Y. Microbiology (Reading). 2003; 149: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The lpqW gene is highly conserved (>80% similarity) in M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, and M. smegmatis. The M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis alleles are identical to each other. The LpqW polypeptide sequence has a putative secretion signal sequence and signal peptidase II cleavage site, suggesting that the mature protein is a secreted lipopeptide. Cell Wall Composition of Mutants and Variants—The cell wall composition of the Myco481 and Myco481.1 mutants was analyzed and compared with the parental strain, M. smegmatis mc2155. No differences were observed in core cell wall components such as mycolic acids and arabinogalactan or in the outer layer glycopeptidolipids (data not shown). However, analysis of fractions containing the PIMs and LAM/LM revealed marked differences between the wild type M. smegmatis and the two mutants. Samples of LAM/LM extracts were applied to SDS-PAGE and silver-periodic acid-stained to reveal LAM and LM (Fig. 3A). Myco481 contained very little LAM; however, Myco481.1 had LAM levels similar to the wild type. LM was evident in both strains. GC-MS compositional analysis of the mannose of LAM/LM was performed to quantitate the LAM/LM. This revealed that Myco481 had greatly reduced levels of mannose (20% of wild type) (Fig. 3B), which can be accounted for substantially by the loss of LAM. Wild type levels of LAM expression were restored in Myco481.1 (Fig. 3B). The LAM/LM fractions of wild type and Myco481.1 contained mannose, arabinose, and myo-inositol in similar ratios, indicating that the pool of Myco481.1 LAM is capped with a mature arabinan component (data not shown). The PIM profile of Myco481 was indistinguishable from that of wild type cells, whereas Myco481.1 had a clearly altered PIM profile (Fig. 3C). Wild type and Myco481 cells accumulated four major PIM species, previously characterized as AcPIM2, Ac2PIM2, AcPIM6, and Ac2PIM6 (12Morita Y.S. Patterson J.H. Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Myco481.1 expressed similar levels of AcPIM2 and Ac2PIM2, this mutant lacked detectable levels of the polar PIM species, AcPIM6 and Ac2PIM6, and it accumulated a new glycolipid species of intermediate polarity (Fig. 3C). GC-MS compositional analysis of this glycolipid indicated the presence of Man, myo-inositol, palmitic acid, and 10-methyl octadecanoic acid (C19:0) in the molar ratio 4:1:1:1, whereas MALDI-TOF analysis of the intact glycolipid gave a [M-H]– molecular ion of 1733, the expected molecular weight of AcPIM4. These data suggest that Myco481.1 is unable to extend AcPIM4 with α1–2-linked Man residues to form AcPIM6, although this species can presumably be extended with long α1–6-Man chains to form LAM. As the α1–6-Man backbone of mature LM/LAM is also modified with α1–2-linked Man side chains, we subjected the mature LAM from wild type cells and the residual LAM pool from Myco481 to methylation linkage analysis. No difference was observed in the degree of substitution and α1–2 branching in the LAM from Myco481, indicating that the mutant does not have a defect in the side chain α1–2-mannosyltransferase (data not shown). Genetic Analysis—As Myco481 contained a Tn611 insertion just 157 bp before the end of the lpqW open reading frame (Fig. 4A), it is possible that the mutant may express a truncated form of the protein that might retain some function. To confirm the phenotype of a mutant lacking functional LpqW protein, a lpqW– mutant was created by placing a kanamycin resistance gene, aphA3, in the middle of lpqW (Fig. 4A). Care was taken to minimize the subculturing of the mutants created. A mutant, named Myco721, was isolated from a plate selecting for DXO mutants and streaked to purity, and a colony was subcultured once in Middlebrook 7H9 broth, which was then stored in aliquots at –70 °C. One aliquot was used to inoculate LB broth, which was grown at 37 °C and subcultured into fresh LB broth every 3 days. At each subculture, a sample was plated on PPLO agar to determine colony morphology. Fig. 4C shows how at first, all colonies were small (a), but after five subcultures, some large colonies appeared (b), and after 10 subcultures, virtually all of the colonies were large (c). One large colony (Fig. 4C, indicated with arrow in b) was picked and named Myco721.1 and was used for further analysis. Disruption of lpqW was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 4B). Cell wall analysis of Myco721 showed that it had little LAM or LM but had a normal PIM profile (Fig. 3). The variant, Myco721.1, regained full LAM/LM synthesis but had a PIM profile altered by accumulation of AcPIM4 and reduced levels of AcPIM6 (Fig. 3). The amount of LM proportional to LAM appears to be elevated in this mutant (Fig. 3A), which accounts for the higher levels of mannose determined by compositional analysis (Fig. 3B). Myco721 was purified and stored immediately after its creation. Frozen aliquots were used as inocula for all subsequent experiments to avoid subculturing. In comparison, Myco481 underwent extensive subculturing on complex media before storage and may have accumulated mutations; therefore, Myco721 is the best genetic representative of a lpqW mutant. Variants derived from Myco481 and Myco721 (Myco481.1 and Myco721.1) were stable in colony phenotype and chemical composition even after extensive subculturing. These results show that disruption of lpqW results in a defect in PIM/LAM synthesis and the mutants ar not stable. Complementation of the defect in Myco721 was achieved by introducing an intact copy of lpqW on a plasmid. Myco721 was transformed with the lpqW complementation plasmid pHBJ212 and with plasmid controls. Transformants containing the control plasmid formed small colonies, whereas transformants containing pHBJ212 (Myco721C) grew as normal sized colonies on complex media. The PIM profile of Myco721C contained the four PIMs seen in wild type and Myco721, but importantly, the LAM/LM was restored by complementation (Fig. 3). These results indicate that disruption of lpqW was responsible for the small colony phenotype and the LAM defect observed in Myco721. Similar results were obtained by complementation of Myco481 (data not shown). The parental strain, Myco481, and Myco721 were readily transformed with pHBJ212; however, complementation of Myco481.1 and Myco721.1 with pHBJ212 was unsuccessful. Either repeated attempts to transform those strains with pHBJ212 failed or the few surviving transformants contained plasmids with large deletions in the lpqW gene. All strains could be transformed with the empty vector or vector containing unrelated genes, indicating that the strains were competent. The wild type could tolerate pHBJ212 and had a normal cell wall composition (data not shown). These results suggest that expression of functional LpqW in the variant strains is deleterious. [3H]Mannose Labeling of Growing Cells—AcPIM4 is thought to represent a branch point intermediate in polar PIM and LAM biosynthesis in M. smegmatis (10Haites R.E. Morita Y.S. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10981-10987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Morita Y.S. Patterson J.H. Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of PIM6 could occur through lack of synthesis, catabolism, or redirection of its precursor to another pathway. To investigate the metabolic fate of AcPIM4 in the mutants, actively growing cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]Man. Label was initially incorporated into PPM and the expected spectrum of PIM intermediates in wild type cells (Fig. 5A) (12Morita Y.S. Patterson J.H. Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the chase period, label accumulated in the end product mono- and diacylated PIM2 and PIM6 species (Fig. 5A). A similar labeling pattern was observed in the Myco481 mutant that contains an identical PIM profile to that seen in wild type cells. In contrast, [3H]Man label in Myco481.1 was initially incorporated into PPM and the PIM species, AcPIM1, AcPIM2, AcPIM3, and AcPIM4. The polar PIM species AcPIM5 and AcPIM6 were not labeled. During the chase period, label in PPM, AcPIM1, and AcPIM3 was depleted with a corresponding increase in label in mono-/diacylated PIM2 and PIM4 species. These data show that AcPIM4 is a transient intermediate in wild type mycobacteria and Myco481 but that it is a relatively stable metabolic end product in Myco481.1, accounting for its accumulation in this mutant. As expected from the chemical analysis, [3H]Man was actively incorporated into LAM during the chase period in both wild type and Myco481.1 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, very little label was incorporated into LAM in Myco481. These data strongly suggest that disruption of lpqW dramatically reduces the flux of PIM intermediates into LAM, without affecting the rate of synthesis of polar PIMs (i.e. AcPIM6). In subsequently derived mutants, represented by Myco481.1, restoration of LAM biosynthesis occurs at the expense of polar PIM biosynthesis, although less polar PIMs (i.e. AcPIM4) still accumulate to high levels. Despite the differences in cell envelopes, all strains grew equally well in Middlebrook broth (Fig. 5C) PIMs and LAM are major plasma membrane and cell wall components of all mycobacteria and appear to be important virulence factors in pathogenic species. Although it is clear that PIMs are both biosynthetic precursors to LAM and metabolic end products in their own right, very little is known about the regulation of these pathways. In this study, we show that disruption of the lpqW gene has a dramatic affect on the ability of M. smegmatis to grow on complex medium and influences the flux of PIM intermediates into LAM. Mutants lacking functional lpqW are unstable but give rise to stable variants in which LAM biosynthesis is restored at the expense of polar PIM biosynthesis. LpqW thus appears to have dual, and possibly related, functions in regulating LM/LAM biosynthesis and the adaptation of mycobacteria to different nutritional environments. The biosynthesis of polar PIMs and LM/LAM likely involves the same early steps, with a bifurcation after the synthesis of AcPIM4 (Fig. 1) (10Haites R.E. Morita Y.S. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10981-10987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Morita Y.S. Patterson J.H. Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gibson K.J. Gilleron M. Constant P. Puzo G. Nigou J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This conclusion is strongly supported by the finding that AcPIM4 accumulated in Myco481.1 and Myco721.1 mutant lines that had no or reduced levels of AcPIM6 biosynthesis, respectively. Myco721.1 differed from Myco481.1 in that it retained some AcPIM6 and had slightly more LM even than WT. These difference suggest that the two variants are not genetically identical; however, the genetic basis of the variation has not been elucidated. The commitment of AcPIM4 to polar PIM or LM/LAM biosynthesis requires the activity of at least two enzymes: a putative α1–2-mannosytransferase and an α1–6-mannosyltransferase, respectively (Fig. 1). Essentially nothing is known about these enzymes. Although LpqW is clearly not essential for the biosynthesis of either polar PIMs or LM/LAM, as mutants lacking this protein can make both classes of glycolipids, our data suggest that LpqW and/or interacting proteins plays a key role in regulating the activity of the α1–2/α1–6 mannosyltransferases or the access of AcPIM4 to these transferases. Specifically, loss of lpqW was initially associated with a dramatic reduction in the synthesis of LAM, whereas the modification of AcPIM4 to form AcPIM6 was unaffected. Following conversion of Myco481 to the stable mutant, Myco481.1, LAM biosynthesis was restored at the expense of AcPIM6 biosynthesis. Overall, PIM biosynthesis in the two mutant cell lines was similar to that of wild type cells. These results provide compelling evidence that AcPIM4 is indeed a branch point intermediate and represent the first demonstration that the synthesis of polar PIMs and LAM can be independently regulated. The capacity to differentially regulate these pathways may be important in ensuring that mycobacteria retain a sizable pool of PIM species (see below) and in regulating the properties of either the plasma membrane, which is rich in PIMs, or the cell wall, which is rich in LAM. There are lpqW homologues in the genomes of all mycobacteria analyzed to date. Although its exact role has not been identified, LpqW appears to be essential for growth of M. tuberculosis as it cannot be disrupted (29Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). LpqW shares no homology with known classes of glycosyltransferases, and its role in PIM and LM/LAM biosynthesis is currently undefined. All mycobacterial LpqW homologues are predicted to be lipoproteins with a secretion signal sequence and signal peptidase II cleavage site, suggesting that they are associated with the external face of plasma membrane. Similarly, we have shown that AcPIM4 is synthesized by a PPM-dependent mannosyltransferase that is spatially separated from the cytoplasmically orientated GDP-Man-dependent transferases that catalyze early steps in PIM biosynthesis (10Haites R.E. Morita Y.S. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10981-10987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Morita Y.S. Patterson J.H. Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As polyprenyl-phosphosugar-dependent transferases are thought to catalyze reactions on the external face of the plasma membrane, most of the AcPIM4 is probably located in the external leaflet of the plasma membrane and/or cell wall. It is possible that LpqW could directly regulate the activity of the α1–2/α1–6-mannosyltransferases or access of AcPIM4 to these transferases. Alternatively, LpqW may have a more general signaling function that indirectly leads to changes in PIM/LAM biosynthesis. LpqW resembles solute-binding proteins that bind a wide variety of ligands, which are subsequently transported across the plasma membrane by ATP-binding cassette transport proteins. LpqW is similar to solute-binding proteins whose roles include internalization of peptides for nutrition and sensing the external medium for specific and nonspecific peptides (30Tam R. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A potential role for LpqW in nutrient sensing is supported by the finding that Myco481 and Myco721 exhibited markedly different growth phenotypes and colony morphologies on different medium. Identifying the connection between LpqW and PIM biosynthesis may shed new insights into signaling mechanisms that regulate cell wall assembly. The finding that the biosynthesis of polar PIMs and LAM can be differentially regulated raises the question as to whether each of these glycolipids have different functions. Recent gene deletion studies in M. smegmatis have provided some insights into the requirement for different PI lipids for mycobacteria growth. PimA and PimB are mannosyltransferases that catalyze the first two mannosylation steps in PIM biosynthesis. Deletion of either of the genes encoding these enzymes is lethal, suggesting that the PIM pathways are essential for growth (9Kordulakova J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B.

These analyses indicated that the large pools of PI and apolar PIMs (Ac/Ac2PIM2) are not essential for viability, whereas loss of polar PIMs was associated with cell death (10Haites R.E. Morita Y.S.

Although the stable Myco481.1 mutant lacked a large pool of AcPIM6, this mutant accumulated a pool of AcPIM4 that likely substitutes for AcPIM6. Collectively, these data suggest that the accumulation of a steady-state pool of PIMs is essential for mycobacteria viability but that the precise structure of the glycan head group may not be critical. In this respect, the capping of AcPIM4 with two α1–2-linked Man residues may constitute a mechanism for preventing the depletion of the PIM pool for LM/LAM biosynthesis under nutrient-limiting conditions."

Human ADAM12, which is implicated in diseases such as cancer, is expressed in two splice forms, the transmembrane ADAM12-L and the shorter and soluble ADAM12-S. ADAM12 is synthesized as a zymogen with the prodomain keeping the metalloprotease inactive through a cysteine-switch mechanism. Maturation and activation of the protease involves the cleavage of the prodomain in the trans-Golgi or possibly at the cell surface by a furin-peptidase. The aim of the present study was to determine the fate of the prodomain following furin cleavage. Here we demonstrate that, following cleavage of the human ADAM12-S prodomain in the trans-Golgi by a furin-peptidase, the prodomain remains non-covalently associated with the mature molecule. Accordingly, both the 68-kDa mature form of ADAM12-S and the 25-kDa prodomain could be detected using domain-specific antisera in immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of human serum ADAM12 and purified recombinant human ADAM12. Using electron microscopy after negative staining we have furthermore obtained the first visualization of a full-length ADAM molecule, human ADAM12-S, and report that it appears to be a compact clover composed of four globular domains, one of which is the prodomain. Finally, our data demonstrate that the presence of the metalloprotease domain appears to be sufficient for the prodomain to remain associated with the mature ADAM12-S. Thus, we conclude that the prodomain of human ADAM12-S is an integral domain of the mature molecule and as such might have specific biological functions in the extracellular space.

From the N terminus, the domain structure of a prototype ADAM consists of a signal peptide, a prodomain, a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a cysteine-rich domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. In addition, splice forms exist for several ADAMs; i.e. for ADAM 9, 12, and 28, shorter secreted and soluble forms have been described (6Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R.

ADAMs are synthesized as proforms, and in the secretory pathway the prodomain keeps the metalloprotease inactive through a cysteine-switch mechanism, thus preventing intracellular degradation (8Gonzales P.E.

J. 2005; 387: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that the ADAM17 prodomain keeps the catalytic domain in a more open conformation that is inactive. Following cleavage of the prodomain in the trans-Golgi or possibly at the cell surface by a furin-peptidase or by autocatalysis, ADAM molecules are proteolytically active and considered mature (7Howard L.

ADAM12, initially called meltrin-α, was first described in 1995 as a transmembrane protein involved in muscle cell fusion (14Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y.

The gene for human ADAM12 resides on chromosome 10q26 and encodes two different forms: a transmembrane form, ADAM12-L, and an alternatively spliced secreted form, ADAM12-S (4Wewer U.M. Engvall E.

Human ADAM12-S has all the extracellular domains but lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Instead, the EGF-like domain is followed by a stretch of 33 unique amino acids.

The only data that exist on ADAM12 structure comes from homology modeling of the metalloprotease domain and selective inhibitors (27Andreini C. Banci L. Bertini I. Elmi S. Rosato A. J. Proteome.

Here we report on the structure of ADAM12 and show that following cleavage and secretion the prodomain of human ADAM12 is not degraded but remains associated with the rest of the molecule. Importantly, this persistent association of the prodomain is observed both for ADAM12 in serum under physiological conditions as well as for recombinant purified ADAM12. In support of this notion, electron microscopic analysis of full-length ADAM12-S and its fragments demonstrates that the prodomain represents one of the leaves of an apparent four-leafed clover-shaped ADAM12. These data represent the first experimental information on the overall structural organization of ADAM12 and the first visualization of a full-length ADAM molecule.

Recombinant full-length human ADAM12 and its fragments were produced by transfecting human 293-EBNA cells with ADAM12 cDNA and purifying ADAM12 from conditioned, serum-free culture medium by gelatin-Sepharose, cation exchange, and concanavalin A or heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography essentially as described (29Thodeti C.K.

Equilibration of the column and elution of ADAM12 was performed using a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The constructs used were (a) cDNA encoding full-length human ADAM12-S (A12) (GenBank accession number NM_021641), (b) cDNA encoding the prodomain, the metalloprotease domain, and the disintegrin domain (A12-PMD) (amino acids 1-512), (c) cDNA encoding the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain (A12-PM) (amino acids 1-419), and (d) cDNA encoding the disintegrin, the cysteine-rich domain, and the EGF-like domain (A12-DC) (amino acids 417-707). For all fragments the ADAM12 signal sequence was utilized, except for the A12-DC where the Ig κ-chain leader sequence from the pSecTaqB vector (Invitrogen) was used (6Gilpin B.J. Loechel F.

These recombinant proteins are biologically active in cell adhesion and/or protease assays (29Thodeti C.K. Frohlich C. Nielsen C.K. Holck P. Sundberg C. Kveiborg M. Mahalingam Y. Albrechtsen R.

For mass spectrometry, the relevant bands were excised from the polyacrylamide gel, reduced, alkylated using iodoacetamide, and digested by trypsin. The resulting fragments were extracted, purified using C18 ZipTip (Millipore), and measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on an AutoFlex instrument (Bruker, Bremen). For identification, the mass spectral patterns of the fragments were matched against the ADAM12 sequence and used for searching against several databases. Visualization of the structure of the various forms of ADAM12 was performed by transmission electron microscopy after negative staining with 0.75% uranyl formate (33Roth J. Bendayan M. Orci L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1978; 26: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). For immunolabeling, ADAM12 samples were first incubated with domain-specific antibodies (6E6 to the disintegrin domain and rb132 to the prodomain) that had been tagged with 4 nm colloidal gold (34Baschong W. Lucocq J.M. Roth J. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Images are presented as direct unprocessed data. We have previously demonstrated that ADAM12 is produced in high amounts by placenta and is present in pregnancy serum, but not in non-pregnancy serum (6Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.G. Engvall E.

More recently, we have presented evidence that maternal serum levels of ADAM12 are reduced in pregnancies with fetal chromosomal abnormalities as well as in preeclampsia, and as such ADAM12 is a promising biomarker in prenatal screening (21Laigaard J. Sorensen T. Frohlich C. Pedersen B.N. Christiansen M. Schiott K. Uldbjerg N. Albrechtsen R. Clausen H.V. Ottesen B. Wewer U.M. Prenat.

Pedersen B.N. et al.Obstet. Gynecol. 2005; 106: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of pregnancy serum using antibodies to the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM12 revealed a 68-kDa single band (15Shi Z. Xu W. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Murphy L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18574-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To further test whether the prodomain is also present, human pregnancy serum was analyzed by Western blot using a mixture of antibodies to the prodomain and to the cysteine-rich domain. We found the 25-kDa prodomain to be present in pregnancy serum but not in non-pregnancy serum (Fig. 1, A and B). To test the interaction between the 68-kDa and the 25-kDa chains of ADAM12, two complementary co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Pregnancy and non-pregnancy serum ADAM12 was immunoprecipitated by antibodies specific to the prodomain or the disintegrin domain followed by Western blot using antibodies to the cysteine-rich domain or the prodomain, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). Under these physiological conditions, the prodomain of ADAM12-S remained associated with the rest of the molecule. Based on these results, the apparent molecular mass of mature ADAM12-S in pregnancy serum is estimated to be ∼100 kDa. We next analyzed the relationship between the prodomain and the rest of the molecule using purified human recombinant full-length ADAM12 and its fragments (Fig. 2A). ADAM12 proteins were purified from cell supernatants by gelatin-Sepharose, cation-exchange chromatography, and concanavalin A affinity chromatography (Fig. 2B). In some studies, gel filtration was used as an additional purification step after the concanavalin A chromatography (Fig. 2C). As demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and Western blots, the prodomain of purified ADAM12 was cleaved from the proform, but not degraded, and remained associated with the rest of the purified full-length ADAM12 molecule (Fig. 2, D and E). To determine which domain the prodomain associates with, truncated forms of ADAM12 were expressed and purified. We found that the prodomain was cleaved and remained associated with the rest of the molecule both in ADAM12 composed of the prodomain, the metalloprotease domain, and the disintegrin domain (A12-PMD) as well as in purified ADAM12 composed of the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain (A12-PM) (Fig. 2, B and D). Because of their similar molecular size and migration pattern under reducing conditions, the two domains of A12-PM cannot be discriminated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2D). However, Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies specific for each of the two domains clearly demonstrated the presence of both domains in A12-PM (Fig. 2, F and G). Mass spectrometry of the purified A12-PM protein validated this conclusion (Table 1). These results strongly suggest that, under the experimental conditions used, the interaction between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain appears to be sufficient to keep the prodomain associated with the rest of the molecule.TABLE 1Tryptic peptides of purified human ADAM12DomainResiduesMolecular Mass MH+SequenceTheoreticalMeasuredPro-domainm/zm/z49–571014.561014.55SGDLWIPVK63–711091.601091.59NHPEVLNIR78–85999.58999.60ELIINLER86–1102724.312724.27NEGLIASSFTETHYLQDGTDVSLAR127–1421659.761659.76GYSDSAVSLSTCSGLRMetalloprotease domain215–2251290.711290.71YVELVIVADNR241–2501151.641151.64LIEIANHVDK251–2581078.621078.62FYRPLNIR259–2721616.841616.82IVLVGVEVWNDMDK273–2902224.012223.98CSVSQDPFTSLHEFLDWR376–3972426.042425.97GGCIMNASTGYPFPMVFSSCSR407–4191491.741491.72GMGVCLFNLPEVR Open table in a new tab One potential mode of interaction between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain would be through the formation of a disulfide bond between the unpaired cysteine residues of the two domains following cleavage. However, when SDS-PAGE of purified recombinant ADAM12 was performed under non-reducing conditions, the prodomain migrated separately from the 68-kDa mature form (Fig. 2H). A similar analysis demonstrated that the prodomain of pregnancy serum ADAM12 migrated separately from the 68-kDa form under both reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1A). These two results suggest that the prodomain is not associated with the rest of the molecule by disulphide bonds, but instead by a non-covalent affinity binding. Notably the 68-kDa band migrated slightly faster under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1, A and B), demonstrating the existence of intradisulfide bonds in the mature form of ADAM12-S. We hypothesize that under physiological conditions, inhibitors, substrates, and even downstream ADAM12 domains can affect the affinity of the prodomain for the metalloprotease domain and potentially replace or displace the prodomain. Such interactions might dictate the activity of the metalloprotease activity of ADAM12. To further determine how the prodomain is structurally related to the remainder of the molecule and to begin to visualize the structure of the entire ADAM12 molecule, we performed negative staining and electron microscopy analyses of full-length recombinant human ADAM12-S (Figs. 3 and 4A), A12-PMD, A12-PM, and A12-DC (Fig. 4, B-D). The predominant structure of the ∼100 kDa full-length molecule was found to be that of a compact clover composed of four apparently globular domains (Fig. 3). The size of the whole molecule is ∼8 nm, and the leaves measure ∼3 nm. Only a few extended molecules were observed. The particles were adsorbed to the carbon film in random orientations and thus exhibited less than four visible domains in some cases, but the maximum number of clover leaves observed was four. Occasionally ADAM12 dimers were observed (Fig. 3, arrowheads), where individual ADAM12 molecules were laterally associated. The different recombinant fragments exhibited the same overall structure as the full-length molecule, but with reduced numbers of globular domains (Fig. 4). The A12-PMD fragment has three globular domains (Fig. 4B), and the A12-PM and the A12-DC fragments each have two domains (Fig. 4, C and D, respectively). To identify the individual domains, we used monoclonal and affinity-purified polyclonal domain-specific antibodies labeled with colloidal gold (34Baschong W. Lucocq J.M. Roth J. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When full-length ADAM12-S was incubated with an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit IgG directed against the prodomain, the images showed one gold particle bound to one of the globular domains (Fig. 4E). Gold-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against the disintegrin-like domain produced similar images, with a gold particle on one domain (Fig. 4F). These data demonstrate that the prodomain is associated with the mature ADAM12 molecule and importantly represent the first visualization of a full-length ADAM molecule.FIGURE 4Electron microscopy of ADAM12-S and its fragments.

Fig. 5 represents a schematic of ADAM12-S based on the collective current knowledge about the structure of human ADAM12-S. We propose that the prodomain of human ADAM12 might influence the functional activities of ADAM12 not only inside the cell as previously reported, but also in the extracellular space.

The similarity in the amino acid sequence of PrPC and PrPSc influences the conversion efficiency and is considered as the major determinant for the species barrier. We performed in vitro conversion reactions on wild-type and mutated PrPC to determine the role of the primary sequence for the high susceptibility of bank voles to scrapie. Different conversion efficiencies obtained with bank vole and mouse PrPC in reactions with several prion strains were due to differences at amino acid residues 155 and 170. However, the conversion efficiencies obtained with mouse and vole PrPC in reactions with sheep scrapie did not correlate with the susceptibility of the respective species to this prion strain. This discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo data may indicate that at least in the case of scrapie transmission to bank voles additional host factors can strongly modulate the species barrier. Furthermore, in vitro conversion reactions with different prion strains revealed that the degree of alteration of the conversion efficiency induced by amino acid exchanges was varying according to the prion strain. These results support the assumption that the repertoire of conformations adopted by a certain PrPC primary sequence is decisive for its convertibility to the strain-specific PrPSc conformation.

Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4049) Google Scholar). Prion diseases are associated with the accumulation of an abnormal, partially protease-resistant isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) in the brain of affected individuals. This disease-related isoform, PrPSc, is identical to PrPC with respect to amino acid sequence and chemical post-translational modifications and, according to the “protein-only” hypothesis, is the major if not the only constituent of the infectious agent (2Caughey B.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure of PrPC is characterized by an unstructured N terminus and a globular C-terminal domain, consisting of three α-helices with a short stretch of β-sheet (4Hornemann S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In contrast to PrPC with its high proportion of α-helices, circular dichroism analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies revealed that the predominant structural element of PrPSc is β-sheet (6Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Reduction of the β-sheet content in PrPSc preparations leads to a diminished level of infectivity, suggesting that the conversion from α-helices into β-sheets is the fundamental event in PrPSc formation as well as for propagating prion infectivity (7Gasset M. Baldwin M.A. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 8Riesner D. Kellings K. Post K. Wille H. Serban H. Groth D. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PrPSc is postulated to replicate in an autocatalytic manner by acting as a conformational template that promotes the conversion of PrPC into its protease-resistant isoform (9Bieschke J. Weber P. Sarafoff N. Beekes M. Giese A. Kretzschmar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12207-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The conversion of PrPC to its protease-resistant state can be modeled in cell-free conversion reactions. Using in vitro conversion reactions it has recently been possible to demonstrate the in vitro generation of infectivity consolidating the protein-only hypothesis (10Castilla J. Saa P. Hetz C. Soto C.

Sci. 1966; 7: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon primary transmission from one species to another a prolongation of the mean incubation period, an increased range of incubation periods, and a reduced fraction of inoculated animals succumbing to clinical disease are observed. On second passage to further animals of the same species the incubation period usually is decreased and becomes much more consistent. The degree of alteration of the incubation time between primary and second passage in the new host is used as a measure for the species barrier.Abrogation of the species barrier has been achieved using transgenic mice expressing PrP genes of other species. Mice expressing hamster PrPC were, unlike wild-type mice, susceptible to hamster prions, demonstrating that the molecular basis of the species barrier mainly resides in differences in the amino acid sequence between PrPSc of the inoculum and PrPC of the inoculated host (13Scott M.

So far protein X has not been identified, and its role for the conversion has been questioned (20Scott M.R. Peretz D. Nguyen H.O. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. J.

Transmission studies with different inbred mouse lines expressing the same PrPC revealed different incubation times, stressing the importance of host-specific factors other than PrPC for the species barrier (22Lloyd S.E.

Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4049) Google Scholar). Prion strains also vary in the biochemical properties of PrPSc with respect to the degree of resistance to digestion with proteinase K (PK) and the pattern of glycosylation (24Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F.

Because different strains can exhibit different incubation times in the same host, it becomes apparent that prion strains and species barriers are related phenomena (27Kimberlin R.H. Walker C.A.

In accordance with the protein-only hypothesis, experimental evidence indicates that different strains are defined by conformational isomers capable of propagating their distinct conformation and the related specific disease phenotypes involved (24Bessen R.A.

Lancet. 1971; 1: 232-233Abstract PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) revealed that field voles (Microtus agrestis) in comparison to mice exhibit very short incubation times after inoculation with scrapie. Recent transmission studies with bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), another wild rodent species closely related to field voles, also demonstrated a high susceptibility to scrapie (34Cartoni C.

We clearly identified specific amino acid residues responsible for the different conversion efficiencies obtained with mouse and bank vole PrPC to several prion strains. Unexpectedly, the high susceptibility of bank voles to sheep scrapie as compared with mice was not reflected by the in vitro conversion efficiencies. In addition, we observed strain-specific changes of the conversion efficiency induced by amino acid exchanges, providing experimental evidence for the assumption that it is not the mere similarity of the primary amino acid sequence but rather the structural compatibility between PrPC and PrPSc that determines conversion efficiency and thereby the extent of the species barrier.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTSE Inocula and Animal Experiments—Bank voles (Istituto Superiore di Sanità breeding colony), C57Bl mice (Charles River, Como, Italy), and golden hamsters (Charles River, Como, Italy) were housed in standard cages and treated according to Legislative Decree 116/92 guidelines, and animal welfare was routinely checked by veterinarians from the Service for Biotechnology and Animal welfare. All animals were individually identified by passive integrated transponders. For natural sheep scrapie isolates, frozen brain tissue from the medulla oblongata was obtained from two Italian Sarda sheep (Ss3 and Ss5) carrying the ARQ/ARQ PrP genotype (indicating amino acids at codons 136, 154, and 171, respectively, on both alleles) and from one British Suffolk Cross sheep (SsUK3) carrying also the genotype ARQ/ARQ. Brain tissue from the UK scrapie case (PG304/02) was provided by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybrigde, UK. For the natural goat scrapie isolate, frozen brain tissue from the medulla oblongata was obtained from an Italian Ionica breed goat carrying a genotype homologue to the sheep ARQ/ARQ.Mouse-passaged TSE strains were supplied by the TSE Resource Centre, Institute for Animal Health, Edinburgh, and hamster-passaged 263K strain was originally donated by Richard H. Kimberlin. The inocula from mouse- and hamster-adapted TSE strains were prepared from individual brains obtained from terminally ill C57Bl mice (ME7) and golden hamsters (263K). New dedicated glassware and instruments were autoclaved at 136 °C for 1 h before use. All samples were homogenized at 10% (w/v) concentration in sterile physiological saline and stored at -80 °C. Groups of 5-15 bank voles, C57Bl mice, or golden hamsters were inoculated by the intracerebral route (20 μl for mice and voles, 30 μl for hamsters) into the left cerebral hemisphere under ketamine anesthesia. Beginning 1 month after inoculation, animals were examined twice a week until the appearance of neurological signs and then were examined daily. The animals were sacrificed with carbon dioxide when they reached the terminal stage of the disease. Survival time was calculated as the interval between inoculation and sacrifice.Vole-passaged strains were newly derived in the Istituto Superiore di Sanità 3Nonno, R., Di Bari, M.

For the in vitro conversion studies, PrPSc was obtained from brain tissue of the third serial passage of 139A, 301C, Ss3, and BSE in bank voles (vole 139A, vole 301C, vole Ss3, and vole BSE, respectively), which showed survival times ± S.D. values of 76 ± 8, 71 ± 3, 90 ± 4, and 79 ± 5, respectively.Generation of Plasmids for PrPC Expression—To generate plasmids for constitutive expression of the prion protein in mammalian cell culture the entire open reading frame of the Prnp gene from different species was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pCIneo vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) after subcloning in either pBluescript II SK(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The open reading frame of the Prnp gene from bank vole (NCBI Nucleotide Database = NCB Accession AF367624), hamster (NCB Accession M14054), sheep (genotype ARQ, NCB Accession AJ000739), and cattle (NCB Accession AJ298878) was amplified from genomic DNA using the primer pairs 5′-CTC ATT AAG CTT AT(C/T) AGC TGT CAT GGC GAA CCT CAG CTA CTG GCT GC-3′/5′-CAA GCA GGG ATC CCT CCC TCA TCC CAC (G/C/T)AT CAG GAA GAT GAG-3′, 5′-CCC TCT TTA TTC TCG AGA TAA GTC ATC ATG GTG AAA AGC CAC ATA GGC AG-3′/5′-GAA AAC AGT CTA GAT GCC CCT ATC CTA CTA TGA GAA AAA TGA GG-3′,5′-CTC TTT ATT GAA TTC AGA AGT CAT CAT GGT GAA AAG CCA CAT AGG-3′/5′-GAA AAC AGT CTA GAT GCC CCT ATC CTA CTA TGA GAA AAA TGA GG-3′, and 5′-CTT CAT TAA GCT TAT CAG CCA TCA TGG CGA ACC TTA GCT ACT GGC-3′/5′-CAA GCA GGG ATC CTT CCT TCA TCC CAC CAT CAG GAA GAT GAG-3′, respectively.

Illinger S.E. Lancet. 1963; 15: 593-598Abstract Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were chosen for transfection due to the absence of detectable endogenous PrPC expression (42Sabuncu E. Petit S. Le Dur A.

Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). RK13 cells were cultivated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose, without glutamine) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with Glutamax, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml was added to the media of cell lines stably transfected with constructs for constitutive expression of the cellular prion protein. For the generation of stable cell lines, RK13 cells were co-transfected with pHA58 (40Windl O. Lorenz H. Behrens C. Romer A. Kretzschmar H.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and derivatives of pCIneo (Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells resistant to hygromycin were selected with 1 mg/ml hygromycin B, and single cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution. The level of PrPC expression was monitored by Western blot analysis after SDS-PAGE of cell lysates.Radioactive Labeling and Purification of PrPC—To obtain PrPC labeled with the sulfur isotope 35S, cell clones were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without cysteine and methionine with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Pan Biotech) supplemented with Glutamax, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Tunicamycin (27 μg/ml) was also included in the starvation media to obtain deglycosylated prion protein. After 1-h starvation Redivue-Promix (Amersham Biosciences) containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine was added in a concentration of 0.23 mCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for 5 h at 37°C with 5% CO2. Afterward cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with cold lysis-buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Igepal, 0.5% desoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA) containing the protease inhibitor mixture Complete Mini without EDTA (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C at 1000 × g, and the supernatant was precipitated with four volumes of cold methanol (4 °C) by spinning at 4000 × g for 20 min after incubation at -20 °C overnight. The methanol was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended into a detergent lipid protein complex buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2% N-laurylsarcosine, 0.4% l-α-phosphatidylcholine) by sonicating three times for 20 s with 70% output intensity using the ultrasound-generator Sonoplus HD2200-UW2200 with BR30 cup-horn sonicator (Bandelin, Berlin, Germany).PrPC was purified from the suspension by immunoprecipitation as described by Caughey et al. (44Caughey B. Horiuchi M. Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using either the antibody RA3153 (45Xiang W. Windl O. Wunsch G.

Bodemer W. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PrPC was eluted from the protein-A Sepharose beads with 0.1 m acetic acid, transferred into 1.5-ml low-binding tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and stored at 4 °C. The activity of purified PrPC samples was measured using the β-counter TRI-CARB 2900TR (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Purification of PrPSc—Purification of PrPSc was performed as described by Hope et al. (47Hope J. Morton L.J. Farquhar C.F. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Kimberlin R.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The final pellet resulting from this purification method was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% zwittergent sulfobetaine 3-14 by subjecting the sample two times for 20 s to ultrasound using the ultrasound generator Sonoplus HD2200-UW2200 with BR30 cuphorn sonicator (Bandelin) at 40% output intensity. The resulting suspension was transferred into 1.5-ml low binding tubes (Eppendorf) and stored at 4 °C. PrPSc was purified from brains of terminally diseased bank voles after the third serial passage of 139A from mouse (vole 139A), Ss3 from sheep (vole Ss3), 301C from mouse (vole 301C), or BSE passaged in sheep (vole BSE). Brains of ME7-infected CL57/Bl6 mice (Prnp-a) were used to prepare PrPSc from mouse (ME7), and brains of 263K-infected golden hamsters were used to obtain PrPSc from hamster (263K). In addition, PrPSc from cattle brain of a British BSE case (BSE) as well as PrPSc from sheep brain of a British (SsUK3) and an Italian (Ss3) sheep scrapie case (named Scrap UK and Scrap Italy, respectively) were also purified. Brain material of the British cattle BSE (case number 02/00996) and sheep scrapie case (case number PG304/02) was provided by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, UK. The purity of the preparations and the concentration of PrPSc were determined by silver staining and Western blot analysis after SDS-PAGE. Brain tissue from scrapie-affected sheep (Ss3 and SsUK3), mice (ME7), and hamsters (263K) used for in vitro conversion were also used for in vivo transmission studies.In Vitro Conversion Reactions—In vitro conversion reactions with purified PrPSc and 35S-labeled PrPC were performed in low binding tubes (Eppendorf) in a reaction volume of 30 μl as described previously (48Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Priola S.A. Kocisko D.A. Race R.E. Bessen R.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chesebro B. Mol. Biotechnol. 1999; 13: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one reaction 15,000 cpm 35S-PrPC were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C with 0.4-1 μg of PrPSc in conversion buffer (200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.625% N-laurylsarcosine, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0). The amount of PrPSc was optimized in saturation studies to obtain the highest conversion efficiency and was varying according to the prion strain. 90% of the reaction volume was digested with PK for 1 h at 37°C (20 μg/ml), and the remaining 10% were left untreated. Further sample preparation was performed as described (48Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Priola S.A. Kocisko D.A. Race R.E. Bessen R.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chesebro B. Mol. Biotechnol. 1999; 13: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain detectable amounts of PrPres in conversion reactions with PrPSc from BSE-affected cattle and scrapie-affected sheep the addition of guanidine hydrochloride (GndHCl) to the reaction buffer was required. Therefore, reactions with BSE and Scrap Italy were performed with 0.4 m and reactions with Scrap UK were performed with 0.7 m GndHCl. For reactions with purified BSE and sheep scrapie PrPC immunoprecipitated with the antibody 3B5 (46Krasemann S. Groschup M.H. Harmeyer S. Hunsmann G. Bodemer W. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. All other reactions were performed with PrPC purified with the antibody RA3153 (45Xiang W. Windl O. Wunsch G. Dugas M. Kohlmann A.

Virol. 2004; 78: 11051-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).After electrophoresis of untreated and PK-digested samples gels were incubated in fixing solution (isopropanol, H2O, and acetic acid in a ratio (v/v) of 25:65:10, respectively) for 30 min and subsequently incubated in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for additional 30 min. Pretreated gels were dried, exposed to a Fujifilm imaging plate BAS-IP MS 2325 (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany), and analyzed using a Fujifilm BAS 1800 II phosphorimagin"

Cells deficient in ATM are extremely sensitive to IR. It has been shown that IR induces immediate phosphorylation of ATM at Ser1981, leading to catalytic activation of the protein. We recently isolated a novel BRCA1-associated protein, BAAT1 (BRCA1-associated protein required for ATM activation-1), by yeast two-hybrid screening and found that BAAT1 also binds to ATM, localizes to double-strand breaks, and is required for Ser1981 phosphorylation of ATM. Small interfering RNA-mediated stable or transient reduction of BAAT1 resulted in decreased phosphorylation of both ATM at Ser1981 and CHK2 at Thr68. Treatment of BAAT1-depleted cells with okadaic acid greatly restored phosphorylation of ATM at Ser1981, suggesting that BAAT1 is involved in the regulation of ATM phosphatase. Protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation of ATM was partially blocked by purified BAAT1 in vitro. Significantly, acute loss of BAAT1 resulted in increased p53, leading to apoptosis. These results demonstrate that DNA damage-induced ATM activation requires a coordinated assembly of BRCA1, BAAT1, and ATM.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in women, with approximately one of nine women being affected in her lifetime (1Alberg A.J. Helzlsouer K.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1997; 9: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Inheritance in breast cancer families follows the classic mendelian pattern of autosomal dominant transmission, with 50% of carriers' children inheriting BRCA1 2The abbreviations used are: BRCA1, breast cancer tumor suppressor gene-1; BRCT,BRCA1 C-terminal; IR, ionizing radiation; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ATM-related; MRN, MRE11-RAD50-NBS1; DSBs, double-strand breaks; BAAT1, BRCA1-associated protein required for ATM activation-1; NMECs, normal mammary epithelial cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PPA2, protein phosphatase 2A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Gy, grays; C7ORF27, chromosome 7 open reading frame 27; 53BP1, p53-binding protein-1. 2The abbreviations used are: BRCA1, breast cancer tumor suppressor gene-1; BRCT,BRCA1 C-terminal; IR, ionizing radiation; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ATM-related; MRN, MRE11-RAD50-NBS1; DSBs, double-strand breaks; BAAT1, BRCA1-associated protein required for ATM activation-1; NMECs, normal mammary epithelial cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PPA2, protein phosphatase 2A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Gy, grays; C7ORF27, chromosome 7 open reading frame 27; 53BP1, p53-binding protein-1. mutations. This inheritance pattern, as well as loss-of-heterozygosity studies in tumors from affected members of BRCA1-linked families, supports the hypothesis that BRCA1 fits the model of a classic tumor suppressor gene, with loss of the normal allele in the tumors of all informative cases (2Chamberlain J.S. Boehnke M. Frank T.S. Kiousis S. Xu J. Guo S.W. Hauser E.R. Norum R.A. Helmbold E.A. Markel D.S. Keshavarzi S.M. Jackson C.E. Calzone K. Garber J. Collins F.S. Weber B.L. Am. J. Hum.

BRCA1, first identified as a breast cancer susceptibility gene, encodes a 1863-amino acid protein with an N-terminal RING finger domain and a C-terminal acidic domain termed the BRCT domain (5Miki Y.

Mutations in both alleles of BRCA1 greatly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, identifying this gene as a tumor suppressor. Gene disruption experiments in mice result in early embryonic lethality and have therefore provided no information regarding BRCA1 function in adult animals (6Gowen L.C. Johnson B.L. Latour A.M.

The BRCA1 protein may act at a number of points in nuclear function and growth control (10Aglipay J.A. Lee S.W. Okada S. Fujiuchi N. Ohtsuka T. Kwak J.C. Wang Y. Johnston R.W. Qin J. Ouchi T.

For example, the immunofluorescence pattern of BRCA1 dramatically changes from discrete nuclear dots to a dispersed pattern when cells are treated with chemical compounds or IR, implying that BRCA1 is involved in a replication checkpoint after DNA damage (10Aglipay J.A.

More recently, we found that BRCA1 plays a crucial role in activating caspase-3 upon UV damage (16Martin S.A. Ouchi T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10657-10662Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An appropriate response to DNA damage is crucial for maintenance of genome stability. Several cellular proteins have been implicated in such processes, such as ATM/ATR protein Ser/Thr kinases, the MRN complex, Fanconi anemia proteins, and the BRCA1 breast cancer tumor-susceptible protein (17Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar, 18Venkitaraman A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Jackson S.P.

In human and murine cells, ATM is required for early response to agents such as IR that induce DSBs. Despite considerable overlap between the processes regulated by ATM and its relative ATR, cells that lack ATM are extremely sensitive to IR. Thus, ATM plays a unique and essential role in determining survival following IR. In its unstimulated state, ATM is proposed to exist as a homodimer in which the kinase domain of one subunit faces the autophosphorylation of another (21Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, the intermolecular phosphorylation site of the subunits promotes dissociation, and the monomers are free to phosphorylate other substrates (21Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar, 22Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2004; 304: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 23Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Use of the phosphorylation site-specific antibody shows that almost maximal ATM autophosphorylation occurs within minutes of IR, even following very low doses. Indeed, ATM autophosphorylation is readily detectable when as few as two or four DSBs are generated enzymatically by ectopic expression of the restriction enzyme I-SceI (21Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). Curiously, exposure of cells to mildly hypotonic buffers or to chromatin-modifying drugs, treatments that do not induce DSBs, also leads to rapid and near-maximal autophosphorylation of ATM. Together, these data suggest that a change in chromatin structure, rather than the presence of DSBs per se, is the stimulus to ATM autophosphorylation (21Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). To further understand the role of BRCA1 in the DNA damage pathway, we studied a novel BRCA1-interacting protein isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening, which we named BAAT1. Biochemical and biological analyses revealed that BAAT1 is required for ATM activation under conditions of IR damage. Given recent studies of the pivotal roles of the MRN complex in ATM activation (22Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2004; 304: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 23Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), it is suggested that the ATM kinase activity is tightly regulated by the coordination of cellular proteins. Identification and Cloning of BAAT1—The CytoTrap vector kit (Stratagene) was used to identify proteins that interact with the BRCT domain. An NcoI/NotI-digested 0.6-kilobase pair DNA fragment of the BRCT domain containing amino acids 1650-1863 in pcDNA3/BRCA1 was subcloned into the pSOS vector and designated as the bait. The human SOS-BRCT domain fusion construct was coexpressed in yeast strain cdc25H expressing the myristoylated target cDNA library derived from human thymus and allowed to incubate at 37 °C. Plasmids from the yeast colonies that grew at 37 °C were isolated, and the DNA was sequenced for identification and cloning. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Western Blotting—NMECs (184B5 cells) and HeLa, U2OS, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. SNU251 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate. For transfections, the calcium phosphate method was used, except when stably expressing BAAT1, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was generated using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Anti-PP2A antibody was provided by Dr. Kazuhiko Yamamoto (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Plasmids and Antibodies—IMAGE clone BC015632 in the pOTB7 vector was purchased (ResGen Inc.). GST-BRCA1 constructs were as described previously (11Ouchi T. Lee S.W. Ouchi M. Aaronson S.A. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anti-BAAT1 antibody was raised against the synthesized peptide AESS-DHVEKSPQSLLQD (Covance Inc.). Co-immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down Assays—HeLa cells or NMECs were lysed for 30 min in 500 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mg/ml leupeptin)). Total cell lysates (1 mg) was incubated with 10 mg/ml of ethidium bromide and the primary antibody for 3 h, followed by overnight incubation with either protein A or G-agarose beads at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Western blotting. To map the interaction site of BAAT1 and BRCA1, 293T cells were cotransfected with both GST-BRCA1 and FLAG-BAAT1. After pull-down with GSH beads, samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Western blotting. Northern Blotting—Full-length BAAT1 and β-actin cDNAs were radiolabeled with radioactive [α-32P]dCTP (Ambion, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A human poly(A)+ RNA Northern blot membrane (12 tissues; OriGene Technologies, Inc.) was blotted with the radiolabeled probes according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purification of Baculoviral BAAT1—His-tagged full-length BAAT1 was produced in Sf9 cells and purified on a nickel column using the protocol described previously (11Ouchi T. Lee S.W. Ouchi M.

Immunocytochemical Analysis—Cells were grown in chamber slides (Fisher) and fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. After three 5-min washes with Tris-buffered saline, the cells were quenched with fresh 0.1% sodium borohydride in phosphate-buffered saline (0.58 m Na2HPO4, 0.17 m NaH2PO4, and 0.68 m NaCl adjusted to pH 7.4) for 5 min.

All secondary antibodies used were species-specific fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (Texas Red-X for mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate for rabbit IgG) and were used at 1:100 dilution throughout the experiments. The cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). The fluorescence patterns were detected by laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope), and the data were analyzed and collected using the Zeiss LSM 510 program (Version 3.2). To minimize the possibility of signal cross-talk, a multitrack configuration was used during data collection. Establishment of siRNA-expressing Cells—The BAAT1 siRNA target sequence 5′-AACGGUCACUGAAGGAGA-3′ (Dharmacon, Inc.) was subcloned into the BglII site of the pSUPER vector (a kind gift from Dr. R.

About 1 × 106 NMECs were transfected with the pBABEpuro vector (provided by Dr. T. Akagi, Osaka Bioscience Institute) at a 1:10 ratio and the pSUPER/Luc-siRNA control or pSU-PER/BAAT1 siRNA. Cell colonies were isolated (2 μg/ml puromycin), and the down-regulation of BAAT1 expression was analyzed by Western blotting. For the okadaic acid assay, cells were preincubated with okadaic acid (0.5 mm) for 3 h and treated with IR (5 grays (Gy)). After 30 min, cell lysates were immunoblotted. For transient transfection of U2OS cells, double-strand RNA of the same sequence given above was introduced into the cells with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were subjected to annexin V staining or immunoblot analysis. Annexin V/Propidium Iodide Staining and Trypan Blue Staining—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by trypsinization, and the concentration was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml. Annexin V was detected using an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (Oncogene Research Products) as recommended by the manufacturer. For the trypan blue assay, cells were treated with IR, and the surviving cells were counted 24 h after staining them with trypan blue (0.4%, w/v). Phosphatase Protection Assay—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (2 × 106) were transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged BAAT1. After 48 h, cells were lysed with EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaC1, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), which does not contain phosphatase inhibitor. Cell lysates (20 μg) were incubated with PP2A (0.1 unit; Upstate). For in vitro PP2A assay, ATM was immunoprecipitated from NMECs treated with IR (5 Gy) for 1 h. Samples were washed extensively with NET-N buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate) and PP2A buffer (Upstate) and resuspended in 20 μl of PP2A buffer. After incubation with purified BAAT1 for 15 min, PP2A (0.1 unit/sample) was added for 30 min at room temperature. Screening and Isolation of BRCT Domain-interacting Proteins—Because the BRCT domain contains transactivation activity (24Chapman M.S. Verma I.M. Nature. 1997; 382: 678-679Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar), it is difficult to isolate interacting proteins using the conventional yeast twohybrid screen. We used a modified yeast two-hybrid screening (see “Experimental Procedures”) with amino acids 1650-1863 of BRCA1 as the bait. We obtained four cDNA fragments that encode partial sequences of metalloproteinase, ribosomal protein L13, elongation factor G-like protein, and a C-terminal part of the uncharacterized C7ORF27 protein. Previously known BRCT domain-associated proteins such as CtIP (C-terminal binding protein-interacting protein) and BACH1 (BTB and CNC homology-1) were not isolated from this screening. The isolated C7ORF27 gene encodes an open reading frame of 546 amino acids, which is a C-terminal part of the full-length cDNA registered in the GenBank™ Data Bank (accession number BC015632). The full-length protein consists of 821 amino acids of 100 kDa and does not show significant homology to proteins registered in the data base or motifs such as a nuclear localizing signal. The amino acid sequences of the human and mouse proteins (NCBI accession number BAC39362) share 73% identity. Homologous proteins of other species are available from the Ensembl Database (available at www.ensembl.org). We named this protein BAAT1 on the basis of its possible roles in the BRCA1/ATM pathway (described below). Northern blot analysis using multiple human tissues showed that a 2.9-kb transcript of BAAT1 is ubiquitously expressed, although slightly increased levels of mRNA were detected in testis and pancreas (Fig. 1a). BAAT1 Associates with BRCA1 and ATM—Interaction of C-terminal BRCA1 and BAAT1 was confirmed using FLAG-tagged BAAT1 and GST-tagged BRCA1 fragments coexpressed in 293T cells. After pull-down of the GST segments using GSH beads, it was found that FLAG-BAAT1 preferentially bound to amino acids 1600-1749 and 1749-1863 of the BRCA1 protein (25Botuyan M.V. Nomine Y. Yu X. Juranic N. Macura S. Chen J. Mer G. Structure. 2004; 12: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), consistent with the results of the yeast two-hybrid screen by which BAAT1 was isolated (Fig. 1b). Long exposure of the x-ray film showed that BRCA1 amino acids 1-324 and 502-802 weakly bound to BAAT1. Significantly, a breast cancer-associated mutant form of the BRCT domain, M1775R, did not bind to BAAT1, suggesting that interaction of BRCA1 with BAAT1 is crucial for the tumor-suppressing activity of BRCA1. The C-terminal BAAT1 domain (amino acids 176-821) showed stronger interaction with BRCA1 compared with full-length BAAT1 in this assay (Fig. 1b,right panel). It has been shown that BRCA1 forms a large complex with cellular proteins termed BASC (BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex), including ATM (26Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Several lines of investigation have also demonstrated that BRCA1 is a substrate of ATM and is involved in the ATM/ATR pathway (27Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gatei M. Zhou B.B. Hobson K. Scott S. Young D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol.

Co-immunoprecipitation of BAAT1 with BRCA1 was detected with two different anti-BRCA1 antibodies (C-20 and 21A1), and physical interaction of BAAT1 with ATM was detected when ATM was immunoprecipitated with two different antibodies (N-17 and 2C1) from HeLa cells, suggesting that BAAT1 is involved in the DNA damage pathway regulated by BRCA1 and ATM (Fig. 1c). BAAT1 Is Involved in the IR Damage Pathway—Functional interaction of BAAT1 with ATM was studied in human NMECs after IR treatment. BAAT1 levels were found to increase after DNA damage, and the amount of BAAT1 associated with ATM also increased (Fig. 2a, left panel). Similarly, increased interaction between BRCA1 and BAAT1 after IR treatment (1 h) was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2a,right panel). The involvement of ATM in DSB signaling and the localization of its substrate histone γ-H2AX to DSBs have been thoroughly studied (21Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar, 31Shroff R. Arbel-Eden A. Pilch D. Ira G. Bonner W.M. Petrini J.H. Haber J.E. Lichten M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1703-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Although no significant γ-H2AX signals had been detected in NMECs before IR treatment, co-localization of BAAT1 and γ-H2AX was increased 1 h after treatment, demonstrating that BAAT1 is present in DSBs (Fig. 2b). The specificity of anti-BAAT1 antibody for immunocytochemical analysis was confirmed with NMECs transfected with BAAT1 siRNA (Fig. 2b,lower panels; see Fig. 4a). These results demonstrate that BAAT1 is involved in the ATM-mediated DNA damage pathway.FIGURE 4Down-regulation of BAAT1 via siRNA in NMECs. a: left panel, BAAT1 levels in isolated clones of NMECs stably transfected with BAAT1 siRNA.

Before IR treatment, both nuclear and cytoplasmic BAAT1 proteins (green) were detected (Fig. 3a,panels a and c), and co-localization with BRCA1 (red) was not prominent (Fig. 3a,panels a and g). After IR treatment, however, overlapped signals (yellow) increased in the nucleus (Fig. 3a,panels a and h). Of note, not all of BAAT1 was co-localized with BRCA1 in IR-treated cells. BAAT1 and ATM were further studied by immunocytochemical analysis using SNU251 cells, an ovarian cancer cell line carrying truncated BRCA1. SNU251 cells were infected with control or BRCA1 adenovirus for 48 h. BRCA1 expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis and immunocytochemistry, which showed the nuclear dot pattern of the protein. Cells were then treated with IR, and localization of BAAT1 and ATM was determined using specific antibodies after 5 h. Immunocytochemical analysis showed nuclear and cytoplasmic ATM (red) and BAAT1 (green) in the control virus-infected SNU251 cells (Fig. 3c). Although BRCA1 expression induced nuclear localization of ATM and BAAT1, no significant co-localization of both proteins was observed (Fig. 3c,lower panels). However, co-localization of both proteins (yellow) was increased after IR treatment in BRCA1-expressing cells (Fig. 3c,lower panels). As determined by counting BAAT1 foci detected by immunostaining in >50 cells, 55, 42, and 44% of BAAT1 co-localized with BRCA1, γ-H2AX, and ATM, respectively. These results demonstrate that co-localization of BAAT1 and ATM is BRCA1-dependent. BAAT1 Is Required for ATM Ser1981 Phosphorylation under Conditions of IR Damage—Recent studies have revealed that phosphorylation of the ATM protein at Ser1981 is crucial for activation of its catalytic activity induced by DNA damage (21Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). We explored the role of BAAT1 in the regulation of ATM activation by decreasing the levels of BAAT1 by siRNA under conditions of DNA damage. NMECs were stably transfected with the BAAT1-specific pSUPER construct (32Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar), and several clones were isolated (Fig. 4a,left panel). Cells were treated with IR, and phosphorylation of ATM was studied 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 12 h after treatment. As shown in Fig. 4b, phosphorylation of Ser1981 was significantly impaired in BAAT1 knockdown cells after IR treatment. Consistent with this, phosphorylation of CHK2 (a known ATM substrate) at Thr68 was also decreased in BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells. Interestingly, depletion of BAAT1 without IR treatment increased p53, which was slightly increased 3 h after treatment (Fig. 4b). Impaired phosphorylation of ATM by IR treatment was also detected in U2OS cells transiently transfected with BAAT1 siRNA (Fig. 4, a,right panel; and b, right panel). The requirement for BAAT1 in ATM activation was studied in mutant BRCA1-expressing HCC1937 and SNU251 cells (Fig. 4c). After treatment of these cells with IR (3 or 5 Gy), cells lysates were immunoblotted for ATM Ser1981 phosphorylation. Interestingly, ATM Ser1981 was phosphorylated in response to IR damage in both cell types. Interestingly, BRCA1 expression in SNU251 cells enhanced ATM phosphorylation by IR (Fig. 4c,right panel). These results demonstrate that, although BRCA1 is not essential for ATM activation, it can enhance its phosphorylation. BAAT1 Depletion Causes Apoptosis without DNA Damage—Because BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells showed high levels of p53, we examined whether these cells show any biological phenotype. Annexin V analysis revealed that BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells showed constitutive apoptosis (23.3%) compared with control cells (7.3%), and IR treatment did not enhance this phenotype (19.4%) (Fig. 5,upper panels). A similar phenotype was observed in U2OS cells transiently transfected with BAAT1 siRNA. These cells showed increased cell death upon depletion of BAAT1 from 4.7 to 12%. These results demonstrate that BAAT1 is involved in the regulation of ATM phosphorylation after DNA damage and that loss of BAAT1 results in activation of the p53-mediated checkpoint, leading to apoptosis. Phosphorylation of ATM Substrates Is Decreased in BAAT1 Knockdown Cells—Impaired Ser1981 phosphorylation under conditions of DNA damage was also detected by immunocytochemical analysis. Although control cells showed increased nuclear signals of phosphorylated Ser1981 (green) after IR treatment (Fig. 6f), such signals were greatly reduced in BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells (Fig. 6h). Consistent with these results, phosphorylation of γ-H2AX (Fig. 6, n and p) and NBS1 (Fig. 6, v and x) was similarly impaired in BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells after IR treatment. As one possible mechanism of impaired ATM phosphorylation in BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells, loss of BAAT1 may result in increased activity of ATM phosphatase. Recently, it has been demonstrated that PP2A physically binds to ATM and regulates Ser1981 phosphorylation (33Goodarzi A.A. Jonnalagadda J.C. Dougras P. Young D. Ye R. Moorhead G.B. Lees-Miller S.P. Khanna K.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4451-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In these studies, a phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, was shown to induce autophosphorylation of ATM. On the basis of these results, possible roles of BAAT1 in ATM dephosphorylation were studied using okadaic acid in BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells. Control and BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells were treated with okadaic acid before IR treatment. Impaired phosphorylation of ATM Ser1981 in BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells was markedly restored after okadaic acid treatment (Fig. 7a,left panels). Interestingly, interaction between ATM and PP2A was not changed in BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells (Fig. 7a,right panels). We further examined whether BAAT1 is involved in the protection of phosphorylated ATM. Hemagglutinin-tagged BAAT1 was expressed in 293T cells, and cell lysates were treated with PP2A for 4 h at37 °C.As shown in Fig. 7b, expression of hemagglutinin-tagged BAAT1 partially protected ATM Ser1981 (but not p53 Ser15) phosphorylation induced by IR. The protection of phosphorylated ATM from PP2A was further examined by in vitro phosphatase assay. ATM was immunoprecipitated from NMECs after IR, followed by incubation with PP2A in phosphatase buffer. Significantly, dephosphorylation of ATM Ser1981 was partially blocked in the presence of baculovirus-produced full-length BAAT1 (Fig. 7c,lower panel). These results suggest that BAAT1 plays a role in the protection of ATM Ser1981 phosphorylation from ATM phosphatase under conditions of DNA damage. The regulation of cellular responses to DNA damage is clearly important for the maintenance of genome stability. Many proteins are involved in the early stage of this pathway, including BRCA1, ATM/ATR, and the MRN complex (26Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 27Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K.

Nature. 2000; 406: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated a complicated mechanism of ATM activation: alteration of the chromatin/chromosome structures directly affects its activation (21Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar, 37Chun H.H. Cary R.B. Lansigan F. Whitelegge J. Rawlings D.J. Gatti R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), or the MRN complex stimulates ATM activity by facilitating stable binding of substrates when NBS1 phosphorylation is present (22Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2004; 304: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 23Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Thus, the MRN complex was found to be a sensor and effector of ATM activation and signaling in response to DSBs. Complementary results indicate that the NBS1 subunit serves as a bridge between ATM and the DNA-bound MRE11/RAD50 heterodimer (38Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Although the original model of ATM activation involved transmission of the DNA damage signal to ATM through structural changes in chromatin, recent studies suggest another model in which the MRN complex forms a bridge between ATM and DSB sites and delivers the signal that triggers ATM Ser autophosphorylation and monomer formation (31Shroff R. Arbel-Eden A. Pilch D. Ira G. Bonner W.M. Petrini J.H. Haber J.E. Lichten M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1703-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Of interest, a pathway involving 53BP1 may sense DSBs. 53BP1 was recently identified as a sensor of DSBs through a mechanism involving unstacking of nucleosomes at sites of DNA DSBs that expose a 53BP1binding site on histone H3 (39Huyen Y. Zgheib O. DiTullio Jr., R.A. Gorgoulis V.G. Zacharatos P. Petty T.J. Sheston E.A. Mellert H.S. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2004; 432: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The evidence indicates that 53BP1 and the MRN complex activate ATM through distinct pathways (40Mochan T.A. Venere M. DiTullio Jr., R.A. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8586-8591PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, 53BP1 is recruited to chromatin in cells treated with hypotonic media (39Huyen Y. Zgheib O. DiTullio Jr., R.A. Gorgoulis V.G. Zacharatos P. Petty T.J. Sheston E.A. Mellert H.S. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2004; 432: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), but ATM activation does not require NBS1 under such conditions (41Difilippantonio S. Celeste A. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Reina-San- Martin B. Van Laethem F. Yang Y.P. Petukhova G.V. Eckhaus M. Feigenbaum L. Monova K. Kruhlak M. Camerini-Otero R.D. Sharan S. Nussenzweig M. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although our present results support the notion that assembly of BRCA1/ATM/BAAT1 is crucial for ATM activation after IR treatment, it remains to be determined whether BAAT1 is involved in MRN pathways. However, we observed co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation of MRE11 and BAAT1 (data not shown), suggesting that at least a certain fraction of BAAT1 may participate in the MRN pathway. We found that, in BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells, ATM phosphorylation is significantly decreased after IR treatment. There are several possibilities to explain this finding. (a) ATM is not recruited to the sites of DSBs; (b) ATM is recruited to the sites of DSBs, but it remains in its dimeric form; and (c) the activity of ATM phosphatase is increased in IR-treated cells. It has been shown recently that PP2A interacts with ATM in undamaged cells and that IR induces phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of PP2A from ATM (33Goodarzi A.A. Jonnalagadda J.C. Dougras P. Young D. Ye R. Moorhead G.B. Lees-Miller S.P. Khanna K.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4451-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid induces autophosphorylation of ATM at Ser1981 in undamaged cells. We found that okadaic acid treatment restored ATM autophosphorylation induced by IR in BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells. Because okadaic acid treatment does not induce γ-H2AX foci, it is likely that it induces ATM autophosphorylation by inactivation of a protein phosphatase rather than by inducing DSBs (33Goodarzi A.A. Jonnalagadda J.C. Dougras P. Young D. Ye R. Moorhead G.B. Lees-Miller S.P. Khanna K.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4451-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We examined the physical interaction between ATM and PP2A in BAAT1 siRNA-expressing cells; however, no significant changes in their interaction were detected (data not shown). These results suggest that, although BAAT1 is involved in the regulation of ATM phosphatase, a precise role of the protein in this pathway remains to be elucidated. To understand more complex nuclear events, further investigation should focus on the specificity of BAAT1 function under various stimuli that activate ATM activity. The generation of mice carrying a mutant baat1 locus should provide definitive evidence of the physiological roles of BAAT1 in the DNA damage pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1989325091,"Proteins of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family play a wide array of functions, covering virtually every aspect of DNA metabolism and function, most notably with the response to DNA damage, transcription, and the maintenance of genomic stability. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel PARP family member, PARP10 (FLJ14464 or hypothetical protein LOC84875). Overexpression of PARP10 results in loss of cell viability, although down-expression by short hairpin RNA leads to delayed G1 progression and concomitant cell death. PARP10 exists in both cytoplasm and nucleus, but only nucleolar PARP10 acquires CDK-dependent phosphorylation through late-G1 to S phase, and from prometaphase to cytokinesis in the nucleolar organizing regions. The PARP activity of PARP10 depends on phosphorylation by CDK2-cyclin E in vitro. CDK-phosphorylated PARP10 is absent in growth-arrested cells. These results suggest that PARP10 functions in cell proliferation and may serve as a marker for proliferating cells."

Like other drugs belonging to the same imidazole family (e.g. miconazole and ketoconazole), its anti-mycotic effect is because of inhibition of cytochrome P-450, an enzyme involved in ergosterol biosynthesis by the yeast (1Georgopapadakou N.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 2Groll A.H. De Lucca A.J. Walsh T.J. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 117-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that CLT inhibits cell proliferation of several normal and cancer cell lines in vitro (3Benzaquen L.R. Brugnara C. Byers H.R. Gattoni-Celli S. Halperin J.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interference with cellular Ca2+ homeostasis contributes to this inhibition; in particular, the action of CLT involves depletion of intracellular Ca2+-stores, also confirmed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, where CLT induces Ca2+ release from thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+-stores (4Jan C.R. Tseng C.J. Chou K.J. Chiang H.T. Life Sci. 2000; 66: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is reported that CLT affects the Ca2+ pump activity of SR vesicles isolated from rabbit heart muscle, producing inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent reactions of the ATPase (SERCA2) obtained from cardiac myocytes (5Snajdrova L. Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28032-28039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). With the experiments reported here, we found that, in fact, CLT inhibited the Ca2+-ATPase. We investigated the effect of CLT on the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) associated with native membrane vesicles derived from rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle. Under optimal coupling conditions, the SERCA pump translocates two calcium ions per ATP molecule from the cytoplasm to the lumen of SR with a turnover rate of about 10 s-1, forming a 3 orders of magnitude Ca2+ gradient (6Andersen J.P.

In addition to biochemical characterization of the ATPase and its partial reactions, we performed direct measurements of charge translocation following adsorption of SR vesicles containing ATPase onto a biomimetic membrane supported by a gold electrode and activation by rapid mixing with a suitable substrate (19Pintschovius J.

For this reason, the Ca2+-dependent reactions of this enzyme are also inhibited. Chemicals—Calcium and magnesium chlorides and MOPS were obtained from Merck at analytical grade. ATP disodium salt (∼97%) and dithiothreitol (≥99%) were purchased from Fluka. Octadecanethiol (98%) from Aldrich was used without further purification. EGTA, calcimycin (calcium ionophore A23187), and 1-[o-chloro-α,α-diphenyl-benzyl]-imidazole (clotrimazole) were obtained from Sigma. The lipid solution contained diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) and octadecylamine (≥99.0%, Fluka) (60:1) and was prepared at a concentration of 1.5% (w/v) in n-decane (Merck), as described by Bamberg et al. (26Bamberg E. Apell H.J. Dencher N.A. Sperling W. Stieve H. Läuger P. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1979; 5: 277-292Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). ATPase Preparation—Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were obtained by extraction from the fast-twitch hind leg muscle of New Zealand White rabbit followed by homogenization and differential centrifugation, as described by Eletr and Inesi (27Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The vesicles derived from longitudinal SR membrane contained only negligible amounts of the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel associated with junctional SR (light vesicles). Free Ca2+ concentration was calculated with the computer program WinMAXC (28Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 was used to prevent Ca2+ accumulation by the SR vesicles (29Hartung K. Froehlich J.P. Fendler K. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2503-2514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). ATPase Activity—Ca2+-ATPase hydrolytic activity was determined following Pi production by a colorimetric method (30Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 80 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 μg of SR protein/ml, and 3 μm A23187 ionophore and were preincubated with various concentrations of CLT for 30 min. The reaction was started by addition of 1 mm ATP. The incubation temperature was 37 °C. 45Ca2+ Binding—Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP was measured by incubating SR vesicles for 30 min (0.1 mg/ml) in a pH 7.0 reaction mixture containing 20 mm MOPS, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,10 μm free [45Ca]CaCl2, and 3 μm A23187 ionophore with different concentrations of CLT. TG (2 μm) was added to half of the samples to provide controls exhibiting no specific Ca2+ binding because it was demonstrated previously that TG prevents specific Ca2+ binding (13Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction temperature was 25 °C. The reaction mixture was filtrated with an 0.45-μm filter, and radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Phosphorylation by [γ-32P]ATP—Enzyme phosphorylation by ATP was measured in a pH 7.0 ice-cold reaction mixture containing 20 mm MOPS, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10, 50, or 200 μm CaCl2, 0.1 mg of SR protein/ml, and 3 μm A23187 ionophore after a preincubation with various concentrations of CLT for 30 min. Individual samples (1 ml) were started by the addition of 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP and quenched at 1 s with 1 m perchloric acid. After filtration and washing of the sample, radioactivity of the sample was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Phosphorylation by [32P]Pi—Enzyme phosphorylation with Pi was measured at 25 °C in a pH 6.2 reaction mixture containing 50 mm MES, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 20% Me2SO after a 30-min preincubation with various concentrations of CLT in the presence of 1 mm [32P]Pi and 0.5 mg of SR protein/ml. The reaction was acid-quenched after a 10-min incubation by the addition of 1 m perchloric acid. The EP measurements were conducted using a filtration method. Measurement of Charge Movements—Charge movements were measured by adsorbing the SR vesicles containing the Ca2+-ATPase onto a biomimetic membrane supported by a gold electrode (the so-called solid-supported membrane (SSM)). The SSM consisted of an octadecanethiol monolayer covalently bound to a gold surface via the sulfur atom with a phospholipid monolayer on top of it (31Seifert K. Fendler K. Bamberg E. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 384-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After adsorption, usually carried out at an applied potential of +0.1 V, the protein was activated by a rapid injection of a solution containing the appropriate substrate, e.g. ATP or Ca2+ ions. If at least one electrogenic step is involved in the relaxation process, a current transient (pre-steady state) can be recorded along the external circuit. The acquisition of transients obtained under different experimental conditions, together with their subsequent elaboration, can provide important kinetic information about protein function and/or its modulation by drugs, peptides, and small soluble proteins. In particular, from a current transient, three main data can be extracted: the peak current, the translocated charge, and the decay time constants. The charge is obtained by numerical integration of the current transient, whereas the decay time constants are provided by a multiexponential fitting of the transient (19Pintschovius J. Fendler K. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 814-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Pintschovius J. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Biophys.

J. 2004; 86: 3671-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The time constants are strictly correlated with the rate constants of the reaction steps involved in the activation of the pump (32Läuger P. Electrogenic Ion Pumps. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1991: 104-136Google Scholar). The preparation of the gold electrodes and the whole experimental set-up as well as the solution exchange technique are described in detail by Tadini-Buoninsegni et al. (25Tadini-Buoninsegni F. Bartolommei G. Moncelli M.R. Inesi G. Guidelli R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3671-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the activation experiments, the composition of the solutions was the following: (a) for Ca2+ concentration jumps, the non-activating solution contained 150 mm choline chloride, 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.25 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and the activating solution had the same composition plus the required CaCl2 amount added from a 5, 50 or 500 mm stock solution; (b) for ATP concentration jumps, the non-activating solution contained 150 mm choline chloride, 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm CaCl2 (100 μm free Ca2+), and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. The activating solution had the same composition plus 100 μm ATP. CLT was added from a 10-mm stock solution in Me2SO to the buffer solution when needed. We studied the effect of CLT on the SR Ca2+-ATPase by a series of biochemical measurements, including ATPase activity, [45Ca]Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP, formation of the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate (E-P) by utilization of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+, and formation of E-P by utilization of [32P]Pi in the absence of Ca2+. In addition, we performed pre-steady state activation experiments with the SSM-based technique (Ca2+ concentration jumps and ATP concentration jumps in the presence of CLT). Biochemical Experiments—It is shown in Fig. 1 that the steady state hydrolytic activity of the Ca2+-ATPase (in the presence of 10 or 200 μm free Ca2+) is inhibited by CLT within the μm concentration range. It is noteworthy that measurements at two different Ca2+ concentrations (10 and 200 μm) yield the same dependence upon the inhibitor concentration, indicating that no protection is obtained by increasing the Ca2+ concentration above the saturating level. With the aim of determining whether the effect of CLT is a total inhibition of SERCA activity (as that of TG) or is rather because of interference with a specific partial reaction, we measured independently [45Ca]Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP, E-P formation by utilization of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+, and E-P formation by utilization of [32P]Pi in the absence of Ca2+. It is shown in Fig. 2 that 45Ca2+ binding and E-P formation from [γ-32P]ATP are inhibited with a similar pattern as the concentration of CLT is increased from zero to 50 μm. It should be pointed out that a limit in the solubility of CLT in the aqueous reaction medium renders a concentration increase above 50 μm rather ineffective. It is noteworthy that the same pattern of inhibition with respect to the CLT concentration was observed when enzyme phosphorylation with ATP was measured in the presence of 10, 50, or 200 μm Ca2+, indicating that the CLT inhibition is not competitive with respect to Ca2+. A most interesting observation is that E-P formation from [32P]Pi (in the absence of Ca2+) is only minimally reduced (Fig. 2), indicating that CLT inhibition of the SERCA pump is mainly exerted on Ca2+ binding and the Ca2+-dependent partial reactions of the enzymatic cycle. On and Off Ca2+ Concentration Jumps in the Presence of CLT in Pre-steady State—A Ca2+ concentration jump, performed with the SSM-based technique, yielded a current transient that could be ascribed to Ca2+ binding to the ATPase. An ON signal was obtained following the injection of the Ca2+-containing solution (Fig. 3A, step 1), and an OFF signal was obtained upon calcium release from the binding site following injection of a solution containing EGTA and no calcium (Fig. 3A, step 2) (25Tadini-Buoninsegni F. Bartolommei G. Moncelli M.R. Inesi G. Guidelli R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3671-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We then performed these experiments in the presence of increasing concentrations of CLT to assess the effect of the drug on Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP. In agreement with direct measurements of Ca2+ binding (Fig. 2), we found that charge movements attributed to Ca2+ binding were also reduced by CLT. Fig. 4 compares a saturating calcium concentration jump in the absence and in the presence of 5 μm CLT, showing a clear reduction of the signal in the presence of the drug. Moreover, a titration with increasing Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 5) shows that the signal is reduced to about one-third of that recorded in the absence of the inhibitor (25Tadini-Buoninsegni F. Bartolommei G. Moncelli M.R. Inesi G. Guidelli R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3671-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the other hand, despite the reduction in maximal binding, the Kd and n values (0.53 and 1.7 μm, respectively) obtained from fitting to the Hill function are very close to those obtained in the absence of drug, either by measurements of charge movements (25Tadini-Buoninsegni F. Bartolommei G. Moncelli M.R. Inesi G. Guidelli R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3671-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or by direct measurements with a radioactive tracer (33Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that non-saturating CLT reduces the amount of Ca2+ bound but does not affect the binding characteristics (i.e. affinity) of the enzyme molecules that are not totally inhibited.FIGURE 5Titration of SERCA with calcium in the presence of 5 μm CLT obtained by Ca2+ concentration jumps experiments. Values are normalized with respect to the bound charge for a saturating Ca2+ concentration jump (10 μm) in the absence of CLT. The solid line represents the fitting to a Hill function (Q = Qnorm, max · Cn /(K0.5n + Cn)), which yields K0.5 = 0.53 ± 0.03 μm and n = 1.7 ± 0.2. The composition of the solution is indicated under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also found that titrations with increasing CLT concentrations in the presence of 10 or 100 μm Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 6) yield the same inhibition curve. These results are in agreement with the experiments on enzyme phosphorylation with ATP (Fig. 2) and ATPase hydrolytic activity (Fig. 1) and imply that increasing the Ca2+ concentration above the saturating level does not protect the enzyme from CLT. Therefore, the CLT inhibition is not competitive with respect to Ca2+. On the other hand, we found that the effective CLT concentration is lower when the inhibitor is added before (KI = 7 μm, as in Fig. 6) rather than after Ca2+ (KI = 35 μm, as in Figs. 1, 2, and 7). A similarly greater resistance of the Ca2+-bound conformation of the enzyme (Ca2E1) as compared with the Ca2+-free conformation (E2) was found previously with respect to TG (13Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and miconazole (34Lax A. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. Am. J.

The inset shows the normalized peak currents (•) and the translocated charges (○) obtained from current transients following 100 μm ATP concentration jumps in the presence of different concentrations of CLT. The normalization was carried out with respect to the current transient obtained in the absence of CLT. The composition of the solutions is indicated under “Materials and Methods.” i, current; t, time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATP Concentration Jumps in the Presence of CLT—An ATP concentration jump in the presence of Ca2+, performed on a SSM with SR vesicles containing Ca2+-ATPase adsorbed onto it, produces a current transient because of the electrogenicity of Ca2+ release into the lumen of the SR and, to some extent, to Ca2+ re-binding to the protein after the hydrolytic cleavage of P-E2 intermediate (Fig. 3B, steps 2 and 4). It was previously determined that the formation and hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphorylated intermediate are not electrogenic (35Butscher C. Roudna M. Apell H.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the effect of 35 μm CLT on a 100 μm ATP concentration jump in the presence of saturating Ca2+ (100 μm). It is clear that the current transient because of Ca2+ translocation is affected by CLT. In fact, starting from no CLT and increasing CLT concentration up to 35 μm, peak currents are progressively decreased. Furthermore, integration of the current transients yields values for moved charges that exhibit a behavior very similar to that of peak currents with respect to the effect of CLT (Fig. 7, inset). It is noteworthy that exponential fitting of the current transients yields two time constants for current decay. The two constants, τ1 and τ2, have average values of 27 ± 2 and 42 ± 3 ms, respectively and do not appear to be significantly affected by CLT (not shown), irrespective of the effect of CLT on peak currents and moved charge. CLT is an antimycotic agent, the effect of which is attributed to inhibition of cytochrome P-450 and ergosterol biosynthesis in yeast (1Georgopapadakou N.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 2Groll A.H. De Lucca A.J. Walsh T.J. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 117-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is also shown that CLT inhibits cell proliferation in vitro (3Benzaquen L.R. Brugnara C. Byers H.R. Gattoni-Celli S. Halperin J.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), interferes with calcium homeostasis in culture cells (3Benzaquen L.R. Brugnara C.

Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28032-28039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have characterized in detail the effect of CLT on the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) activity associated with microsomal vesicles obtained from skeletal muscle. This enzyme preparation is highly purified and well suited to characterization of the catalytic cycle and its partial reactions (6Andersen J.P. Vilsen B.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3556-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), thereby yielding useful grounds for comparison of inhibitory mechanisms. Finally, the simultaneous use of biochemical and biophysical methods in the characterization of the CLT inhibitory mechanism has given us the opportunity to demonstrate clearly the functional relevance of charge transfer measurements and their correspondence to partial reactions of the ATPase cycle. As outlined in Fig. 3B, the ATPase (SERCA) cycle requires initial activation through Ca2+ binding from the exterior of the vesicles (step 4) followed by utilization of ATP to form a phosphorylated intermediate (step 1). The bound Ca2+ is then dissociated into the lumen of the vesicles (Fig. 3B, step 2) followed by hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphoenzyme (step 3). Using direct binding assays by a radioactive tracer as well as measurements of charge movements by the SSM-based technique, we found that the initial Ca2+ binding, before utilization of ATP, is inhibited by CLT (Figs. 2, 4, and 6). It is of interest that plots of charge as a function of Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 5) yield affinity constants and cooperative behavior identical to that of equilibrium binding isotherms obtained in the absence of CLT by direct measurements with isotopic tracer (33Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The correspondence of the two types of measurements is highly satisfactory and demonstrates the specificity of charge movement with regard to Ca2+ binding and its inhibition by CLT. Considering the absolute Ca2+ requirement for enzyme activation, it is expected that steady state ATPase activity will be inhibited in parallel with inhibition of Ca2+ binding by CLT. In fact, we found that steady state ATPase activity and Ca2+ transport were inhibited by the same CLT concentrations producing inhibition of Ca2+ binding. This was demonstrated by measuring Pi by a colorimetric method after adding ATP to the enzyme in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1) as well as by measuring charge translocation following an ATP concentration jump by the SSM-based technique (Fig. 7). Here again, identical results were obtained by the biochemical and biophysical methods. An interesting observation is that, whereas CLT clearly decreases the amount of moved charge (Fig. 7), the decay kinetics of the remaining current transient is not affected by CLT (not shown). Therefore, although an increasing number of enzyme molecules are inactivated by CLT, the remaining enzyme molecules do not bind CLT and continue to function normally. This suggests a specific inhibitory site for CLT within the ATPase molecule whereby the ATPase molecules are inhibited independent of each other. Furthermore, comparative experiments performed by addition of CLT before or after Ca2+ suggest that the Ca2+-free conformation of the enzyme is more sensitive to CLT and is stabilized by the bound inhibitor. We also found that phosphoenzyme formation by utilization of ATP in the presence of Ca2+ is inhibited by CLT within the same concentration range as Ca2+ binding (Fig. 2) and ATPase hydrolytic activity (Fig. 1), with a pattern consistent with noncompetitive inhibition. However, phosphoenzyme formation by utilization of Pi in the reverse direction of cycle is only minimally affected by CLT (Fig. 2), as also observed by Snajdrova et al. (5Snajdrova L. Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28032-28039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This reverse reaction is not dependent on activation by Ca2+ and in fact requires removal of bound Ca2+ (36Masuda H. de Meis L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is apparent that the ATPase catalytic mechanism is not primarily affected by CLT but only secondarily, through interference with activation by Ca2+ binding. Such a specific interference with a partial reaction (i.e. Ca2+ binding) is of interest when compared with the global inhibition of the ATPase cycle produced by TG. So far, 1,3-dibromo-2,4,6-tris(methylisothiouronium)benzene is the only other ATPase inhibitor producing specific inhibition of a single partial reaction, i.e. the E1-P ↔ E2-P transition (37Hua S. Xu C. Ma H. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17579-17583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It should be noted that CLT shows a rather high affinity for SERCA with a KI of 35 μm in the presence of Ca2+ and KI of 7 μm in the absence of Ca2+. Considering the hydrophobic character of the CLT molecule and the location of cation-binding sites in the membrane-bound region of transport ATPases, it is apparent that CLT interferes at this location with the binding of the activating cation and with the conformational change involved in cation binding. In addition to the significance of the CLT effect with regard to the catalytic and possibly pharmacological mechanism, we consider that stabilization of the Ca2+-free, E2 conformation of the enzyme, leaving the catalytic site in a functional state as revealed by the Pi reaction, may be an extremely useful tool in structural and crystallization studies of cation transport ATPases. In fact, ATPase crystal structures of the highest resolution are presently obtained by incorporation of two (rather than one) inhibitors, permitting detection of ordered water molecules and advanced electrostatic calculations yielding estimates of the proton occupancy of acidic residues (38Obara K.

https://openalex.org/W2007771847,"At cholinergic synapses, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is critical for ensuring normal synaptic transmission. However, little is known about how this enzyme is maintained and regulated in vivo. In this work, we demonstrate that the dissociation of fluorescently-tagged fasciculin 2 (a specific and selective peptide inhibitor of AChE) from AChE is extremely slow. This fluorescent probe was used to study the removal and insertion of AChE at individual synapses of living adult mice. After a one-time blockade of AChEs with fluorescent fasciculin 2, AChEs are removed from synapses initially at a faster rate (t1/2 of ∼3 days) and later at a slower rate (t1/2 of ∼12 days). Most of the removed AChEs are replaced by newly inserted AChEs over time. However, when AChEs are continuously blocked with fasciculin 2, the removal rate increases substantially (t1/2 of ∼12 h), and most of the lost AChEs are not replaced by newly inserted AChE. Furthermore, complete one-time inactivation of AChE activity significantly increases the removal of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Finally, time lapse imaging reveals that synaptic AChEs and AChRs that are removed from synapses are co-localized in the same pool after being internalized. These results demonstrate a remarkable AChE dynamism and argue for a potential link between AChE function and postsynaptic receptor lifetime.

Although much work has been devoted to the molecular characterization of AChE, little is known about how this enzyme is maintained and regulated at single mature synapses in vivo. Previously, a few studies have attempted to investigate the turnover of AChE at the NMJ. Most of these studies have relied upon analysis by an indirect method using a radioactively labeled ligand. The AChE half-life was then inferred from measurements by comparing the amount of AChE insertion into synapses in entire muscles at various times after initial saturation. These studies suggest that AChEs are very stable in the basal lamina (t1/2 around 20 days) (12Salpeter M.M. Kasprzak H. Feng H. Fertuck H. J. Neurocytol. 1979; 8: 95-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Kasprzak H. Salpeter M.M. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 951-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we sought to study AChE dynamics more directly using fluorescence imaging techniques by assaying the intensity of fluorescently-tagged fasciculin 2 at individual junctions in living mice. Fasciculin 2 is a toxin isolated from the green mamba snake (14Karlsson E. Mbugua P.M. Rodriguez-Ithurralde D. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1984; 79: 232-240PubMed Google Scholar) and belongs to the same family as α-bungarotoxin, the selective AChR blocker (16Menez A. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1557-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Fasciculin 2 has very high affinity for AChE, similar to the binding of α-bungarotoxin to nicotinic receptors (17Marchot P. Khelif A. Ji Y.H. Mansuelle P. Bougis P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12458-12467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, radiolabeled fasciculin 2 has been used to quantify AChE density at the NMJ (18Anglister L. Eichler J. Szabo M. Haesaert B. Salpeter M.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 81: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently, fluorescent fasciculin 2 has been used to label AChE on cultured cells, on fixed muscle (4Peng H.B. Xie H. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and in living synapses (19Martinez-Pena y Valenzuela I. Hume R.I. Krejci E. Akaaboune M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that the interaction between fluorescenctly-tagged fasciculin 2 and AChE is strong enough to be used as a powerful tool to study AChE dynamics in living synapses. We demonstrate that synaptic AChE removal is dependent upon its blockade with fasciculin 2, and blockade of AChE results in a profound decrease in AChR half-life. Removed AChEs from synapses are in most cases co-localized with AChRs in the same intercellular compartments. Animals—Non-Swiss Albino mice (6-10-week-old females, 20-25 g) used in this study were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Toxins—Fasciculin 2 was purchased from Latoxan and conjugated by Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Conjugation and purification of fasciculin 2 with the Alexa 594 dye was performed in 1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3) by dissolving the succinimidyl ester of the dye in aqueous media as described by Panchuk-Voloshina et al. (20Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Bishop-Stewart J. Bhalgat M.K. Millard P.J. Mao F. Leung W.Y. Haugland R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The conjugate fasciculin 2 Alexa dye was purified from unconjugated dye by size exclusion chromatography using Bio-Gel P-30 (Bio-Rad), with or without a small addition of Toyopearl HW-40 (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA). The dye attached to one or more lysine residues in the protein at the ratio of 1.5 mol of Alexa 594 attached/mol of fasciculin 2. We also derived biotinylated toxin by incubating fasciculin 2 with NHS-XX-Biotin (Sigma) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. The ratio of biotin to fasciculin 2 was found to be 2:1. The unincorporated biotin was eliminated by using a NAP5 column (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled and unlabeled bungarotoxin were purchased from Molecular Probes. Biochemical Analysis of the Labeled Toxin—Supernatant of COS cells transfected with Rat AChE cDNA was mixed with conjugated or unconjugated fasciculin 2 in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. AChE activity was then determined by the Ellman method. The mix was incubated with acetylthiocholine (0.5 mm) and DTNB (0.75 mm), and the yellow color variation was monitored with a plate reader (Bio-Rad) at 415 nm over time. A curve of AChE activity inhibition in the presence of conjugated and unconjugated fasciculin 2 was then generated (Fig. 1A). Encapsuled Enzyme—Mouse brain was homogenized in 10 ml of cold buffer solution (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.154 m NaCl, 2 mm benzamidine) and centrifuged for 30 min at 18000 × g. The pellet was then solubilized in 1 ml of cold buffer solution containing 1% CHAPS as detergent. This crude detergent extract was mixed with acryl-bisacrylamide (10% final concentration), ammonium persulfate and TEMED were then added, and the mix was poured into a calibrated 50-μl siliconed glass capillary. Immediately after polymerization, the gel was expulsed and cut into 4.5-mm fragments (corresponding to 3 μl of gel). Butylcholinesterase activity was irreversibly blocked by incubating the fragments in phosphate buffer containing 5 × 10-5 m tetra(monoisopropyl)pyrophosphortetramide for 16 h (20Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Bishop-Stewart J. Bhalgat M.K. Millard P.J. Mao F. Leung W.Y. Haugland R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) and then washed out with phosphate buffer. To measure initial AChE activity, each fragment was individually put into the wells of a microtitration plate and bathed with 100 μl of Ellman solution for 3 min or 10 min on a plate mixer; the supernatant of each well was transferred into the well of a new plate with a multichannel pipette, and the well containing the gel was covered with 100 μl of phosphate buffer for 10 min to wash the yellow product resulting from the enzymatic reaction that still remained in the gel. The 100 μl of washing solution was then mixed with Ellman's solution, and the OD at 415 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). After measuring AChE activity, the fragments were incubated for 3 h with 1 μm conjugated or unconjugated fasciculin 2. The gels were washed twice with 100 μl of phosphate buffer for 15 min, and the activity was measured again to be sure that all AChE activity was blocked (as described previously), and the fragments were incubated with 100 μl of phosphate buffer for the duration of the experiment. For example, after 1 day, the phosphate buffer was collected, and recovery of AChE was measured as described above. The ΔOD/min for each fragment was measured and normalized to gel controls that were not incubated with fasciculin 2. The same procedure was repeated for each data point (from 1 to 7 days). Each point represents the mean of three fragments, and the experiment was reproduced with independent extracts from mouse brain. We initially tried this experiment with the collagen-tailed forms of AChE from mouse muscle extract, but the concentration of AChE in the crude extract is too low to be reliable for measuring AChE activity. In Vivo Imaging of Neuromuscular Junctions—The techniques of animal preparation, sternomastoid muscle presentation, and neuromuscular imaging used in this work have been previously described in detail (21Lichtman J.W. Magrassi L. Purves D. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this study, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine (17.38 mg/ml). The anesthetized mouse was placed on its back on a customized microscope stage, and synapses were viewed through neutral density filters under an automatic programmable controller using a water immersion objective (× 20 universal apochromate, 0.7 numerical aperture Olympus BW51; Optical Analysis Corp.) and a digital CCD camera (Retiga EXi, Burnaby, Canada). When animals were monitored over days, the incision was sutured after each session, and the animal was allowed to fully recover before the next imaging session. Quantitative Fluorescence Microscopy—The intensities of fluorescent bungarotoxin bound to AChR and fluorescent fasciculin 2 bound to AChE at neuromuscular junctions were assayed using a quantitative fluorescence imaging technique that was developed by Turney and colleagues (22Turney S.G. Culican S.M. Lichtman J.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 64: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Akaaboune M. Culican S.M. Turney S.G. Lichtman J.W. Science. 1999; 286: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which relies on ratiometric comparisons of fluorescence intensity at synapses with the intensity of a nonbleaching inorganic fluorescence polymer concurrently viewed with the same optical system. This technique compensates for spatial and temporal variations in image brightness due to the light source, microscope, and camera and therefore permits analysis of changes in fluorescence intensity (i.e. number of fluorescent molecules) during and between imaging sessions over any time interval. Image analysis was performed using IPLAP (Sacanatytic) or Matlab (Mathworks). Single Saturating Dose of Alexa 594 Fasciculin 2—To ascertain the dose of fluorescent fasciculin 2 necessary to saturate all AChE binding sites in vivo, we generated a standard curve of AChE saturation with fluorescent fasciculin 2, and we found that all AChEs were saturated after applying a concentration of 7 μg/ml fluorescent fasciculin 2 to the sternomastoid of the mouse for 3 h. To be sure that all AChE molecules had been saturated with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594, a second fluorescently labeled fasciculin 2 (fasciculin 2-Alex 488) was added to the sternomastoid muscle, and synapses were imaged. The absence of green labeling indicated that the original Alexa 594 fasciculin 2 adequately saturated all AChE molecules. The loss of AChE was then monitored over time with or without saturating AChRs with a single application of α-bungarotoxin (5 μg/ml, 1.5 h). We and others have shown that the dose of bungarotoxin used in this study is sufficient to silence postsynaptic response (24Duxson M.J. J. Neurocytol. 1982; 11: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Balice-Gordon R.J. Lichtman J.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26Akaaboune M.

Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3433-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion of AChE—To test whether the loss of AChE that occurs following saturation of the NMJ with fluorescent fasciculin 2 is matched by a corresponding insertion of new AChE, AChEs were saturated with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 (7 μg/ml, 3 h), and the nonbound Alexa 594 fasciculin 2 was washed out continuously with lactated Ringer's for 15-20 min. The first views of superficial NMJs were imaged, the wound was sutured, and the animal was allowed to recover in a heat chamber. From 1 to 7 days later, the animal was anesthetized, sternomastoid muscle was exposed, and the same synapses were reimaged to assay the loss of fluorescence intensity. At each time point, AChEs were then saturated a second time with new fresh fasciculin 2-Alexa 594, and fluorescence intensity was again assayed. Chronic Blockade of AChE with Fasciculin 2-Alexa 594—To assay the effect of continuous AChE blockade on AChE loss rate, the sternomastoid muscle was saturated with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 (7 μg/ml for 3 h), and superficial synapses were imaged. We then maintained the AChE blockade by adding new fresh fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 (7 μg/ml) to the neck every 2 h for the duration of the experiment (8 h). In this way, AChE activity was continuously blocked with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594. During the experiment, animals were reanesthetized and intubated with an artificial respirator. These experiments could not be carried out for more than 8 h because of mortality, presumably due to the blockade of synaptic transmission. At the end of the experiment, the muscle was washed out continuously with lactated Ringer's for 15-20 min, and then the same synapses were relocated and imaged, and their fluorescence intensity was assayed. Effect of AChE Inhibition on Postsynaptic AChR Removal—To determine the effect of AChE inhibition on the removal rate of postsynaptic AChRs, the sternomastoid muscle was labeled with a low dose of Alexa 594 bungarotoxin (5 μg/ml for 2 min; Molecular Probes), so synaptic transmission remained fully functional. After waiting 1-2 days to allow clearance of unbound fluorescent bungarotoxin, superficial synapses were imaged, and then a single saturating dose of fasciculin 2 (7 μg/ml, 3 h) was added to the sternomastoid muscle to block AChE activity. Three days later, superficial neuromuscular junctions that had been labeled with fluorescent bungarotoxin were reimaged, and their fluorescence intensities were measured. Confocal Microscopy—The sternomastoid muscle of normal and denervated mice (8-10 days after nerve axotomy) was doubly labeled with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 (to label AChE) and Alexa 488 bungarotoxin (to label AChR). 3-6 days after initial labeling, synapses were imaged using in vivo fluorescence imaging or confocal microscopy. The analysis of intracellular co-localization of AChE/AChR was carried out using oil immersion lenses and laser illumination on an Olympus FV500 confocal microscope. A series of optical planes were collected in the z dimension (z-stack) and collapsed into a single image. One z-stack image was chosen to show the intracellular colocalization of AChR and AChE. Images presented under “Results” were produced and adjusted for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop 8. Use of Fluorescent Fasciculin 2 as a Probe for Studying AChE Dynamics in Vivo—In this study, we first tested whether fluorescent fasciculin 2 can be used as a probe to label AChE in living animals and if it is suitable for studying the dynamics of AChE in vivo. To this end, the sternomastoid muscle of an anesthetized mouse was labeled with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 (2 μg/ml); after only a 30-min incubation with fluorescent toxin, synapses were bright enough to be readily imaged. The saturation of all AChEs was then achieved by applying a concentration of 7 μg/ml fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 for at least 3 h to the neck of the mouse. To determine the specificity of fluorescent fasciculin 2 labeling at synapses in vivo, the sternomastoid muscle was saturated with unconjugated fasciculin 2 (7 μg/ml, 3 h) or a specific AChE inhibitor BW284C51 (10 mg/ml, which competes with fasciculin 2). When fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 was then added to the muscle, no fluorescent signal was detected at synapses. In addition, the labeling of AChE with fluorescent fasciculin 2 was absent in ColQ-/- mutant mice in which AChEs fail to cluster at synapses (28Nguyen-Huu T. Dobbertin A. Barbier J. Minic J. Krejci E. Duvaldestin P. Molgo J. Anesthesiology. 2005; 103: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results indicate that fluorescent fasciculin 2 labels only when AChE binding sites are available. To determine whether conjugation of fasciculin 2 with Alexa dye modifies the binding properties of the toxin, recombinant AChE was mixed with conjugated or unconjugated fasciculin 2, and the inhibition curves were compared (Fig. 1A). A small shift to the right (corresponding to a decrease in affinity) was observed for conjugated fasciculin 2; however, at a concentration of 10 nm (70 ng/ml), almost all AChE activity was inhibited by both conjugated and unconjugated fasciculin 2, leaving only residual activity, as previously described (29Eastman J. Wilson E.J. Cervenansky C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19694-19701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This result indicates that conjugation of the toxin with Alexa dyes does not significantly modify its properties. To monitor spontaneous AChE-fasciculin 2 dissociation, we followed the apparent unbinding of fluorescent fasciculin 2 both in vitro and in vivo. Mouse brain extracts containing a high concentration of AChE tetramers (100 nm) were encapsulated into a gel, which was then cut in small fragments and incubated with conjugated or unconjugated fasciculin 2. After a 3-h incubation with 7 μg/ml conjugated or unconjugated fasciculin 2, AChE activity was inhibited, and only residual activity was detected, as described previously (29Eastman J. Wilson E.J. Cervenansky C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19694-19701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). AChE activity recovery (presumably due to the apparent fasciculin 2 dissociation from AChE) was then measured over 7 days. At each time point, the phosphate buffer was replaced with a fresh buffer. After 7 days, only a very slow recovery of AChE activity was detected in both conjugated (corresponding to recovery a half-time of ∼15 days) and unconjugated fasciculin 2 (t1/2 more than 20 days) (Fig. 1B). The apparent dissociation of AChE-fluorescent fasciculin 2 at the NMJ was then assessed in situ, where the concentration of AChE is estimated to be very high (∼0.2 mm) (18Anglister L. Eichler J. Szabo M. Haesaert B. Salpeter M.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 81: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). First we tested whether the saturation of AChE by fluorescent fasciculin 2 is achieved in fixed and living synapses under the same labeling conditions. To do this, fixed and living sternomastoid muscles were labeled with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 (7 μg/ml, 3 h) to saturate all AChE binding sites. To ensure that all AChEs were saturated by fasciculin 2-Alexa 594, a dose of fluorescently labeled (green) fasciculin 2-Alexa 488 was applied. No green fluorescence signal was observed after this labeling. This result indicates that the same level of maximal binding occurs in both fixed and living tissue. To assay the dissociation of fluorescent fasciculin 2-AChE, fixed muscle was saturated with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594, and superficial synapses were then imaged, and the loss of fluorescence was monitored over time using the same procedure that was used to label synapses in vivo. After 7 days, we found that the decrease in fluorescence was only 10 ± 3.9% (S.D., n = 20) of original fluorescence (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained when the sternomastoid muscle was first fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, saturated with fluorescent fasciculin 2, and then transplanted into the neck of a host mouse. After 7 days, we found that the loss in fluorescence was only ∼15% (n = 6) at the NMJs (t1/2 of loss ∼30 days) (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that the rapid loss of fluorescent fasciculin 2 from the surface of synapses in vivo (see below) is not due to biological processes that occur at the surface of the NMJ. Altogether, these results suggest that the koff of fasciculin 2 is slow at the NMJ. Whereas the above controls suggest that fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 has a strong affinity for AChE, we were surprised to find that unconjugated fasciculin 2 can displace conjugated fasciculin 2. Living or fixed synapses were saturated with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594/488, and superficial synapses were imaged, and then a high concentration of unlabeled fasciculin 2 (5-10-fold excess) or BW284C51 (10 mg/ml) was added continuously into the muscle. After 8 h, we found that 94 ± 5% (S.D., n = 60) of the fluorescence intensity was lost from synapses. Surprisingly, however, when synapses in fixed tissue were labeled with biotin-fasciculin 2 followed with streptavidin Alexa 488/594 and then incubated with a high concentration of unlabeled fasciculin 2 (10-fold higher than biotin fasciculin 2) or BW284C51 (10 mg/ml), no evidence of fluorescence loss was observed during the same time period. Similarly, when fixed synapses were saturated first with unconjugated or conjugated fasciculin 2 (Alexa 488 or Alexa 594) and incubated over 8 h with a high concentration of fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 or Alexa 488, the loss of fasciculin 2 was negligible. These results indicate that unconjugated fasciculin 2 displaces conjugated fasciculin 2, but one conjugated fasciculin 2 does not displace another. Therefore, it is important to avoid using contaminated conjugated fasciculin 2 with unconjugated fasciculin 2. We tested if changes of fluorescent fasciculin 2 in synapses in situ were due to bleaching. Synapses of fixed or live muscle were imaged and reimaged several times in succession using a water immersion objective (× 20 universal apochromate 0.7 numerical aperture), 25% light, and an exposure time of 100 ms. We found that there was no obvious loss of fluorescence intensity. This result excludes the possibility that bleaching is occurring under our imaging conditions. Altogether, these experiments indicate that fluorescent fasciculin 2 is an excellent probe to monitor AChE dynamics over time in vivo. Removal and Insertion of AChE from the Neuromuscular Junction in Vivo—The loss of AChE from synapses was monitored over time following a single saturating dose of fluorescent fasciculin 2. Sternomastoid muscles from 10 mice were labeled one time with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 (7 μg/ml, 3 h) to saturate all AChEs. Superficial synapses were then imaged. The same synapses were relocated and reimaged one or multiple times over the next 7 days, and their fluorescence intensities were then measured using a quantitative fluorescence imaging assay. We found that 24 h after initial labeling, AChE fluorescence intensity was decreased by 23 ± 5% (S.D., n = 60) (half-life of ∼3 days). This rate of loss slows over time; at 7 days, 63 ± 6% (S.D., n = 20) of fluorescence intensity was lost, whereas fluorescence loss at the NMJs of fixed, labeled, and transplanted muscle was only about 15% over the same period (Fig. 2, A-C). Thus, the degradation of AChE from living synapses is ∼12 days when corrected for fasciculin 2 unbinding. Similar results were found when the muscle was labeled with biotin-fasciculin 2, followed by a single saturating dose of Alexa 488/594 streptavidin. The removal rate of labeled AChE from the NMJ was nearly identical in the presence or absence of postsynaptic AChR blockade with α-bungarotoxin. In addition, when the postsynaptic receptors were continuously blocked with α-bungarotoxin, the loss of fluorescently labeled AChE over 8 h was comparable with loss of AChE in the absence of postsynaptic blockade, indicating that the removal of AChE from the synapse does not require postsynaptic activity. Next we asked whether continuous AChE blockade affects its removal rate. To do this, the sternomastoid muscle was labeled with fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 to saturate all AChEs (7 μg/ml, 3 h). Superficial synapses were then imaged, and the same fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 was reapplied every 2 h for 8 h to ensure chronic AChE activity blockade; in this way, the continuous presence of fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 should result in the immediate blockade of any newly inserted AChEs). Because unconjugated fasciculin 2 and BW284C51 cause fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 displacement, we used only fasciculin 2-Alexa 594 to test the effect of chronic blockade on the net number of AChEs labeled with the same fluorescent fasciculin 2. Interestingly, junctions in which AChE was chronically blocked with fluorescent fasciculin 2 lost AChEs at a high rate of ∼5%/h for at least 8 h (65 ± 6% (S.D., n = 34) remained after chronic blockade; t1/2 = 12 h) (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, the net number of fluorescently labeled AChEs significantly decreased, indicating that lost AChE is not replaced by an equivalent addition of new AChE into the neuromuscular junction and also arguing aga"
https://openalex.org/W2059292769,"Nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) is an inducible transcription factor that plays a key role in regulating the expression of a wide range of immune and inflammatory response genes. The activity of NFκB is controlled at multiple levels, including cytoplasmic retention with inhibitor of κB (IκB) proteins in the basal state. Persistent activation of the transcription factor is seen in numerous chronic inflammatory disease states, and we have previously demonstrated sustained activation of NFκB in human glial cells upon stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1β. In these cells, NFκB retains DNA binding activity for up to 72 h despite the presence of resynthesized IκBα and in the absence of IκBβ. Here we characterized the apparent inability of newly synthesized IκBα to terminate activation of NFκB in glial cells. We showed unexpectedly that newly synthesized IκBα can enter the nucleus, interact with the NFκB subunit p65, and export it to the cytoplasm. However, in vitro analysis of enzyme activity demonstrates that IL-1β causes the long term activation of the IκB kinase complex leading to chronic phosphorylation of the newly synthesized IκBα signal response domain and persistent activation of NFκB. Such sustained activation of NFκB is dependent on the continuous presence and activity of IL-1β. Interestingly, the sustained nature of NFκB activity is promoter type-specific. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that p65 is detected at the promoters of both intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and IL-8 1 h following IL-1β stimulation but is only found at the latter at 24 h. The functional significance of this finding is indicated by the transient induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mRNA, but more sustained induction of IL-8 expression, by IL-1β. These studies thus demonstrated that persistent IL-1 signaling causes sustained activation of NFκB in a promoter-specific manner in human glial cells, leading to prolonged induction of selective pro-inflammatory genes. This is likely to make a key contribution to chronic inflammatory conditions of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2078536849,"The nuclear factor of activated T (NFAT) cell family of transcription factors is important in regulating the expression of a broad array of genes, including cytokines, T cell surface receptors, and other transcription factors. NFATc1 and NFATc2 are two principal NFAT members that are expressed in peripheral T cells. Levels of NFAT expression in T cells are partly transcriptionally regulated, but less is understood regarding their post-transcriptional control. We show here that NFATc1 and NFATc2 are rapidly degraded in apoptotic T cells. NFATc2 is highly sensitive to cleavage by caspase-3, whereas NFATc1 is only weakly sensitive to caspase-3 or caspase-8. Two potential caspase-3 cleavage sites were identified in the N-terminal transactivation domain. These sites were confirmed by in vitro caspase cleavage assays. Abolition of NFATc2 cleavage by mutation of these two cleavage sites resulted in augmented NFAT transcriptional activity. Furthermore, NFAT activity could be augmented in wild-type effector T cells by inhibition of caspase activity. Of particular interest was that non-apoptotic T cells from cellular FLIP long transgenic (c-FLIPL-Tg) mice that manifest elevated caspase activity have greatly reduced levels of NFATc2 protein and NFAT transcriptional activity.

Our findings reveal a new post-transcriptional regulation of NFATc2 that operates, not only during apoptosis, but also in non-apoptotic effector T cells. Apoptosis is a genetically programmed, morphologically distinct form of cell death that can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including irradiation, cytokine withdrawal, hormones, and viruses. The common biochemical pathway of these processes is the initiation of downstream effector caspase, a family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases (1Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar, 2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Numerous caspase targets have been identified that disrupt important cellular metabolic and structural components, contributing to the stereotypic morphological and biochemical changes that characterize apoptotic cell death (3Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). More recently it has been appreciated that caspase activity is also necessary for certain types of cell development and proliferation (4Garrido C. Kroemer G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In these situations, it is less clear what initiates the caspase cascade and what are the substrates of caspases in actively proliferating, non-apoptotic cells. This is particularly true in T lymphocytes, where caspase-8 and caspase-3 are activated following T cell activation (5Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1891-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 6Dohrman A. Russell J.Q. Cuenin S. Fortner K. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 3999-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, identifying caspase substrates in T cells is central to defining their role in cell growth and death. A potential candidate for the regulation of caspase activity during T cell activation is the death receptor inhibitor, c-FLIPL 2The abbreviations used are: c-FLIPL, cellular FLIP long; FLIP, FLICE inhibitory protein; FLICE, FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme; FADD, Fas-associating death domain; Tg, transgenic; Z-, b enzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; aa, amino acid(s). (cellular FLICE inhibitory protein-long). c-FLIPL is a caspase-8 homolog that lacks enzymatic activity due to mutations in the C-terminal caspase domain (9Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). However, c-FLIPL can heterodimerize with caspase-8 via its mutual death effector domains and caspase-like domain and activate caspase-8 by repositioning an activation loop of caspase-8 without any proteolytic processing (10Micheau O. Thome M. Schneider P. Holler N. Tschopp J. Nicholson D.W. Briand C. Grutter M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45162-45171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Increased expression of c-FLIPL in T cells leads to augmented caspase activation (6Dohrman A. Russell J.Q. Cuenin S. Fortner K. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Lens S.M. Kataoka T. Fortner K.A. Tinel A. Ferrero I. MacDonald R.H. Hahne M. Beermann F. Attinger A. Orbea H.A. Budd R.C. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5419-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this capacity, c-FLIPL may thus be a principal regulator of caspase-8 activity and other downstream caspases in effector T cells. This could result in cleavage of selective substrates that might be critical for proper effector T cell function, as in cytokine production. The NFAT family of transcription factors has crucial roles in T cell development and function by regulating the transcription of a broad array of cytokines, T cell surface receptors, and other transcription factors (12Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). The NFAT family consists of the five members NFATc1 through NFATc5. NFATc1 and NFATc2 are the principal NFAT members in mature T cells (13Macian F. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of NFAT-deficient mice confirm a strong influence of this transcriptional family on cytokine expression patterns. Thus, NFATc1-deficient mice exhibit diminished production of Th2 cytokines (14Yoshida H. Nishina H. Takimoto H. Marengere L.E. Wakeham A.C. Bouchard D. Kong Y.Y. Ohteki T. Shahinian A. Bachmann M.

By contrast, mice lacking NFATc2 manifest increased and prolonged IL-4 expression (16Kiani A. Viola J.P. Lichtman A.H. Rao A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which is further augmented in NFATc2–/– × NFATc3–/– mice (17Ranger A.M. Oukka M. Rengarajan J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 627-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 18Rengarajan J. Tang B. Glimcher L.H. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in both NFATc1 and NFATc2 in T cells manifest profoundly impaired production of many cytokines, including IL-2, -4, and -10, IFN-γ, GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor), as well as expression of CD40L and FasL (19Peng S.L. Gerth A.J. Ranger A.M. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 2001; 14: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). NFATc2 has also been demonstrated to be involved in cell cycle control. NFATc2 inhibits CDK4 expression by directly binding and repressing its transcription through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (20Baksh S. Widlund H.R. Frazer-Abel A.A. Du J. Fosmire S. Fisher D.E. De-Caprio J.A. Modiano J.F. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Consistent with that observation, T cells from NFATc2-deficient mice are hyperproliferative and manifest increased levels of several cyclins (21Caetano M.S. Vieira-de-Abreu A. Teixeira L.K. Werneck M.B. Barcinski M.A. Viola J.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1940-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that the N-terminal transactivation domain of NFATc2 contains two highly sensitive caspase-3 cleavage sites and is processed, not only in apoptotic T cells, but also in non-apoptotic T cells from c-FLIPL-Tg mice that have elevated caspase activity. This results in dramatically reduced levels of NFATc2 and NFAT activity in c-FLIPL-Tg T cells. Inhibition of caspase activity results in restoration of uncleaved NFATc2 in c-FLIPL-Tg T cells and enhances NFAT transcriptional activity. A noncleavable NFATc2 mutant also increases NFAT activity. The findings demonstrate a previously unknown caspase-3 substrate and propose a new mechanism for the post-translational regulation of NFATc2 in effector T cells. CD4+ T Cell Purification and Culture—Spleen cells were hemolyzed and combined with lymph node cells followed by negative selection to enrich the population for CD4+ cells. The cells were incubated with antibodies to CD8 (Tib105), major histocompatibility complex class II (3F12), NK1.1 (PK136), and CD11b (BD Biosciences) for 30 min. The samples were washed and then incubated with goat anti-rat/mouse IgG-labeled magnetic beads (Polysciences, Inc.) for 45 min followed by magnetic field separation to remove CD8+ cells, B cells, NK cells, and macrophages. CD4+ T cell purity was confirmed by flow cytometry and was typically >90%. The cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml, 145–2C11) and anti-CD28 ascites (1:500) plus recombinant human IL-2 (50 units/ml, Cetus) and cultured in complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 2.5 mg/ml glucose (Sigma), 10 μg/ml folate (Invitrogen), 110 μg/ml pyruvate (Invitrogen), 5 × 10–5 m β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 292.3 μg/ml glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 5% fetal bovine serum). On day 2 after stimulation, T cells were removed from anti-CD3-coated plates and propagated in IL-2-containing medium. Induction of Apoptosis—Anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-stimulated day 4 effector CD4+ T cells were resuspended in complete medium at 10 × 106/ml. Apoptosis was induced by incubating the cells with 200 ng/ml FLAG-tagged FasL (Apotech Corporation) and 4 μg/ml of cross-linking anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Caspase Activity Assay—Cellular caspase activity was determined by the Apo-ONE™ Caspase-3/7 assay kit (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of medium and mixed with 100 μl of caspase substrate. After incubation at room temperature, fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Plasmid Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—FLAG-tagged NFATc2 and FLAG-tagged NFATc1 were kindly provided by Dr. Sean Diehl and Dr. Melissa Brown, respectively. Asp-29 and Asp-66 of NFATc2 were mutated to Ala using the primers 5′-CCCAAGACGAGCTGGCCTTTTCCATCCTCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGATGATGTCCTGGCCTATGGCCTCAAGCC-3′ and their complementary oligonucleotides that overlap the target sites. Mutants were made using the QuikChange® II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. In Vitro Caspase Cleavage Assay—Wild-type, D29A NFATc2, D66A NFATc2, or D29A/D66A NFATc2 plasmids were transcribed and translated using the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. 2.5 μl of in vitro translation products were incubated in 50 μl of assay buffer (20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10% sucrose, pH 7.2) with caspase-3 or caspase-8 at 37 °C. Reactions were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblotting. Biotin-VAD-fmk Caspase Precipitation Assay—Whole cell lysates were made from cells that were preincubated with 10 μm biotin-VAD-fmk (MP Biomedicals) at 37 °C for 15 min. 600 μg of whole cell lysate protein was first precleared with Sepharose 6B (Sigma) for 2 h to remove nonspecific binding, followed by overnight incubation with streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.. After being washed to remove unbound proteins, the streptavidin-Sepharose-bound complex was resuspended in sample loading buffer and boiled. Supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were made as follows. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Applied Science)) followed by centrifugation. The antibodies used were NFATc1 (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.), NFATc2 (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.), NFATc2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), P44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/ERK2) (New England Biolabs), actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and FLAG (Sigma). Proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed by chemiluminescence. Gel Mobility Shift and Supershift Binding Assays for NFAT—Nuclear extracts were obtained as previously described (22Phillips R.J. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions were done using 2 μg of nuclear protein in the presence of 10,000 counts/min of the specific 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-GTAATAAAATTTTCCAATGTAAA-3′ for 20 min at 4 °C. For supershift analysis, 1 μg of anti-NFATc1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) or anti-NFATc2 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) was incubated with the binding reaction mix. NFAT-Luciferase Reporter Mice and Luciferase Activity—NFAT-luciferase transgenic mice contain the firefly luciferase gene driven by a 200-bp fragment of the IL-2 minimal promoter (–326 to –294 and –72 to +47) with NFAT-binding sites inserted in an XhoI site between these fragments (23Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Purified CD4+ T cells were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. At 48 h following activation, the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed. The lysates from 0.5 × 106 cells were then analyzed using luciferin and measured in a luminometer for 10 s. Two measurements were made for each sample. Results are presented as the average of two measurements with background subtracted. For experiments with caspase inhibitor, T cells were first activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 48 h and then cultured for an additional 24 h in the absence or presence of 50 μm Z-VAD-fmk before being lysed and analyzed for luciferase activity. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 18 h after transfection, the cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (500 ng/ml) for 6 h before being lysed for luciferase activity measurement. Selective Degradation of NFATc1 and NFATc2 during Fas-induced Apoptosis—During apoptosis, caspases are activated and cleave various vital proteins, including certain transcription factors that are critical to normal cell function (24Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). Scanning the protein sequence of NFATc2, we identified two caspase-3 consensus cleavage sites (26DELD29, 63DVLD66) in the N-terminal transactivation domain (Fig. 1A). A DELD consensus site has been defined as a caspase cleavage site in several proteins, including acinus, D4-GDI, MstII, and FOXO3a, whereas DVLD is a caspase cleavage site in RAD51 (3Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 25Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y.

Day 4 effector T cells were treated with Fas ligand (FasL) for different times, and whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot for NFATc2 and NFATc1, the major NFAT family members that are expressed in mature T cells. For both NFATc2 and NFATc1, the latter of which includes three isoforms, NFATc1A, -B, and -C (29Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Tyrsin D. Akimzhanov A. Moroz D. Jha M.K. Schulze-Luehrmann J. Santner-Nanan B. Feoktistova E. Konig T. Avots A. Schmitt E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Schimpl A. Serfling E. Immunity. 2002; 16: 881-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), most of the full-length protein disappeared within 3 h of FasL treatment (Fig. 1B). The loss of full-length NFAT was prevented by the addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1C). In addition, no cleavage fragments of NFATc2 or NFATc1 could be detected at these time points at the level of sensitivity of these assays. This suggests that either the molecules were rapidly degraded or the epitopes of the cleaved fragments were not detectable by the antibodies used. During apoptotic cell death, only a fraction of the cellular proteome is cleaved by caspases (30Robaye B. Doskeland A.P. Suarez-Huerta N. Doskeland S.O. Dumont J.E. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Amess B. Tolkovsky A.M. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1255-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To show that the caspase-dependent cleavage of NFAT was selective, immunoblot for an unrelated signaling molecule, ERK, revealed that it remained intact for at least 3 h of FasL treatment. The levels of the loading control actin were also unchanged during the treatment (Fig. 1B). Measurement of caspase-3 activity by the DEVD-rhodamine fluorogenic assay revealed the expected increase in caspase activity over the same time period after FasL treatment (Fig. 1D). NFATc1 Is Weakly Sensitive to Cleavage by Caspase-3 and Caspase-8—In addition to caspases, other proteases that contribute to the cleavage of various cellular proteins (32Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2766-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) are also activated during apoptosis. To investigate whether degradation of NFATc1 and NFATc2 during apoptosis was mediated by caspases, the potential cleavage of NFATc1 and NFATc2 was examined using an in vitro caspase cleavage assay. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 were chosen, because they represent, respectively, an upstream initiator caspase and a downstream executioner caspase that are both activated during FasL-induced apoptosis as well as during T cell receptor-mediated activation (8Misra R.S. Jelley-Gibbs D.M. Russell J.Q. Huston G. Swain S.L. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3999-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). N-terminal FLAG-tagged NFATc1 or NFATc2 was transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with recombinant caspase-3 or caspase-8. Reactions were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblotting. In the presence of as much as 100 ng of caspase-3 or 200 ng of caspase-8, only a small proportion of NFATc1 was cleaved after 2 h, as revealed by both autoradiograph and immunoblot (Fig. 2A), indicating that NFATc1 was only weakly sensitive to caspase-3 and caspase-8 in vitro. Agreeing with this, there is no typical caspase cleavage site in the NFATc1 amino acid sequence. To confirm the activity of the caspases in vitro, c-FLIPL was used as a positive control substrate, because c-FLIPL is a known substrate of both caspase-3 and caspase-8 (9Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). In contrast to NFATc1, most of c-FLIPL was rapidly cleaved within 30 min by 50 ng of caspase-3 or caspase-8 (Fig. 2B). NFATc2 Is a Substrate of Caspase-3 but Not of Caspase-8—The in vitro cleavage assay showed that NFATc2 was totally resistant to caspase-8. In the presence of as much as 200 ng of caspase-8, no cleavage of NFATc2 was detected after 2 h of incubation (Fig. 3A). By contrast, the autoradiograph revealed that NFATc2 was highly sensitive to cleavage by caspase-3 (Fig. 3B). At a caspase-3 dose as low as 6.3 ng, virtually all of full-length NFATc2 was cleaved to a slightly lower molecular weight. Only at higher doses of caspase-3 was this initial cleavage product further processed to at least three fragments. A similar rapid loss of detectable full-length NFATc2 was apparent using an anti-FLAG antibody that reacts to the N-terminal FLAG tag of NFATc2 (Fig. 3B, second panel). No new cleavage fragments were detected by the anti-FLAG immunoblot, suggesting that there might be a caspase-3 cleavage site close to the N terminus. In addition, the cleavage of NFATc2 was reversed in the presence of caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, confirming that cleavage was due to caspase activity and not other proteolytic activity. To further define the sites of NFATc2 cleavage by caspase-3, we examined the cleavage products with two monoclonal anti-NFATc2 antibodies that react to different epitopes. The first antibody reacts to amino acids 51–69 of NFATc2 (Fig. 1A). This antibody revealed the same pattern of loss of full-length NFATc2 as did the anti-FLAG immunoblot, with no appearance of a cleaved NFATc2 fragment (Fig. 3A). The second anti-NFATc2 antibody reacts to amino acids 433–567. This antibody revealed an immunoblot pattern similar to the autoradiograph, in that an NFATc2 fragment appeared that was only slightly lower in size than full-length NFATc2 (Fig. 3B). The cleaved NFATc2 fragment was detectable with anti-NFATc2-(433–567) at low dose caspase-3 and was still detectable at higher doses. In addition, this anti-NFATc2 antibody also detected further cleavage fragments at higher doses of caspase-3, nearly identical to the pattern seen in the autoradiograph. Caspase-3 Cleaves NFATc2 at the Consensus Sites 26DELD29 and 63DVLD66—Collectively, the above studies suggested that NFATc2 possesses a highly sensitive caspase-3 cleavage site(s) very near the N terminus, with possible additional less-sensitive sites in other parts of the molecule. To determine whether caspase-3 could cleave either of the two candidate sites in the N terminus of NFATc2, alanine substitutions were introduced at Asp-29 (D29A NFATc2) and Asp-66 (D66A NFATc2) or at both sites (D29A/D66A NFATc2). These were in vitro translated and subjected to caspase-3 cleavage. Based on both the autoradiograph and the immunoblot, the cleavage of NFATc2 by 50 ng of caspase-3 was completely prevented in the double mutant D29A/D66A NFATc2 (Fig. 4B). A closer inspection of the cleavage products of the single mutant NFATc2 molecules suggested that 26DELD29 was somewhat more sensitive to caspase-3 than 63DVLD66, because full-length D29A NFATc2 was slightly protected from cleavage by 50 ng of caspase-3 (Fig. 4B, lane 4), whereas full-length NFATc2D66A was still efficiently cleaved at the 26DELD29 site (Fig. 4B, lane 6). It is interesting that the single mutation of D66A totally abolished the recognition of NFATc2 by the anti-NFATc2-(51–69) antibody (Fig. 4B, lanes 5–8). This is consistent with the known specificity of this monoclonal antibody to amino acids 51–69 of NFATc2. It also likely explains why this antibody could not detect any cleavage fragments after wild-type NFATc2 was cleaved by caspase-3 (see Fig. 3B). Higher Caspase-3 Activity and Decreased NFATc2 Expression in c-FLIPL-Tg CD4+ T Cells—According to the in vitro cleavage assay, NFATc2 is extremely sensitive to caspase-3 and is rapidly cleaved following Fas ligation. However, caspase activation also has recently been demonstrated in viable effector T cells (8Misra R.S. Jelley-Gibbs D.M. Russell J.Q. Huston G. Swain S.L. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3999-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We thus considered that NFATc2 might be subject to caspase cleavage in non-apoptotic situations when caspase activity is mildly elevated in T cells. The level of caspase activity in effector T cells is likely regulated to a large extent by the initial heterodimerization of caspase-8 with c-FLIPL. c-FLIPL contains a loop in its C terminus that binds and activates the enzymatic pocket of caspase-8 (10Micheau O. Thome M. Schneider P. Holler N. Tschopp J. Nicholson D.W. Briand C. Grutter M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45162-45171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This leads to activation of downstream caspases in effector T cells, including caspase-3 (8Misra R.S. Jelley-Gibbs D.M. Russell J.Q. Huston G. Swain S.L. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3999-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We thus wanted to investigate NFATc2 expression and NFAT activity in cycling effector T cells bearing normal levels of caspase activity versus elevated levels. The latter occurs in c-FLIPL-Transgenic (c-FLIPL-Tg) mice, in which increased expression of c-FLIPL in T cells provokes augmented caspase activity and proliferation (6Dohrman A. Russell J.Q. Cuenin S. Fortner K. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Lens S.M. Kataoka T. Fortner K.A. Tinel A. Ferrero I. MacDonald R.H. Hahne M. Beermann F. Attinger A. Orbea H.A. Budd R.C. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5419-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Caspase activity was initially determined by the DEVD-rhodamine assay and showed that both freshly isolated and day 4 effector c-FLIPL-Tg CD4+ T cells possessed more caspase activity than equivalent T cell populations from normal littermate controls (Fig. 5A). Because this assay reflects, not only caspase-3 activity, but also other caspases, we precipitated selectively the active caspase fraction from effector T cells by first incubating them with biotin-VAD and then subjecting cell lysates to precipitation with streptavidin-Sepharose. As anticipated, more c-FLIPL was present in the biotin-VAD precipitate from c-FLIPL-Tg CD4+ T cells, consistent with the model that c-FLIPL heterodimerizes with and activates caspase-8. Importantly, more cleaved active caspase-3 was revealed in the c-FLIPL-Tg CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5B). Having established that c-FLIPL-Tg CD4+ T cells have more caspase activity, especially more active caspase-3, than wild-type CD4+ T cells, we examined the level of NFATc2 expression and NFAT activity in CD4+ T cells of both groups. Immunoblot of whole cell lysates for NFATc1 showed little difference in expression of the three NFATc1 isoforms A, B, and C (Fig. 6A, upper panel). By contrast, levels of NFATc2 protein were profoundly reduced in c-FLIPL-Tg CD4+ T cells (Fig. 6A, second and third panels). This was apparent both in naïve resting T cells as well as in days 1 and 2 effector T cells. However, mRNA levels of NFATc2 were not significantly different between wild-type and c-FLIPL-Tg CD4+ T cells (Fig. 6B). NFAT DNA binding was also examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. This revealed that nuclear extracts from c-FLIPL-Tg CD4+ T cells had less NFAT binding activity than non-transgenic littermate cont"

Eur J Hum Genet. 1998; 6: 12-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CFTR mediates cAMP-dependent chloride transport that plays a critical role in the regulation of fluid homeostasis in the airway and in other organs. Although CF affects the function of various organs, pulmonary disease represents the most common source of morbidity and mortality associated with the disorder. CFTR mediates fluid and chloride transport in epithelial cells, and interacts directly with the cytoskeleton and with various cellular proteins, including receptors, chaperones, and other transport proteins (3Cai Z.

Numerous mutations in the CFTR have been identified and associated with CF in humans (4Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). The most common mutations associated with CF include both missense and deletion mutations that result in the synthesis of CFTR proteins that are mistrafficked and degraded. CFTRΔ508 is the most common mutation causing CF in Caucasians and is caused by the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 in the polypeptide, resulting in its misfolding and degradation and failure of its association with the apical membrane (5Cheng S.H.

The severity of CF-related lung disease is highly variable, even among individuals bearing the same mutations, indicating that the disorder is influenced by complex, hereditary, and environmental factors (6Clain J.

Similarly, marked variability in the severity of gastrointestinal and pulmonary disorders is observed among various strains of mice bearing CFTR mutations (8Snouwaert J.N. Brigman K.K. Latour A.M. Iraj E. Schwab U. Gilmour M.I. Koller B.H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: S59-S64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support the concept that the cellular dysfunction associated with CFTR mutations may be influenced by the expression of modifying genes that compensate for or exacerbate the cellular functions disrupted by the lack of CFTR or the presence of misfolded CFTR. Previous in vivo and in vitro studies indicated that the lack of CFTR influences complex transcriptional responses that may influence the pathogenesis of CF-related disorders (9Norkina O. Kaur S.

Lack of CFTR in the lung is associated with changes in the expression of genes regulating fluid and electrolyte transport, intracellular trafficking, inflammation, as well as of proteins that directly bind and interact with CFTR, indicating that CFTR functions within a complex, transcriptional, and functional milieu within the cell (10Xu Y.

In the present study, functional genomics were used to identify cellular responses caused by lack of CFTR expression, CFTRΔ508 expression, and increased expression of wild-type human CFTR in respiratory epithelial cells of the adult mouse lung. Transgenic Mice and Animal Husbandry—The genotypes and characteristics of the mice used in this study are listed in Table 1. Briefly, wild-type (FVB-N) mice (Cftr+/+) were compared with FABP-hCFTRtg, Cftr-/- mice (Cftr-/-) (11Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. DuVall M.D. Frizzell R.A. Whitsett J.A.

Whole lung tissue was isolated from freshly sacrificed adult mouse from each genotype. Total RNA was isolated from homogenized lung tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) based on the manufacturer's instruction. Lung RNA was isolated from sex- and age-matched littermates to minimize the potential influence of strain differences. Individual mouse lung was carefully dissected, and the conducting airways and mediastinal structures were removed. PCR was performed on cDNAs prepared from these samples at the conditions of 95 °C × 30 s, 56 °C × 30 s, and 72 °C × 1 min for total of 35 cycles. The primers for mCftr and hCFTR were designed to recognize sequences unique to the mouse endogenous Cftr or the human CFTR sequence expressed as transgene. The primers for mCftr were forward: 5′-ACCTCATTGCCTCACGGAGACATC-3′ and reverse: 5′-AACAAGTCCCAGAGAAGCCCCATC-3′. The primers for hCFTR are forward: 5′-TAAACCTACCAAGTCAACCA-3′ and reverse: 5′-AATTCCATGAGCAAATGTC-3′. The primers for β-actin are forward: 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAC-3′ and reverse: 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′. The mRNA levels of selected genes were confirmed by LightCycler reverse transcription-PCR using the following probes for mouse Hsp40, Hsp70, Foxf1a, and Thsd1.

Lung Histology and Immunofluorescent Staining of CFTR and CFTRΔ508—MLE15 cells were seeded into 6-well plates containing 3 coverslips in each well. 1 μg of 3.7hSP-C/CFTR-FLAG or 1 μg of 3.7hSP-C/CFTRΔ508-FLAG plasmids were transfected to each well using Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, coverslips holding transfected cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After incubation with 0.1% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, the cells were blocked with 5% goat serum for 1 h and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 3 h and Texas red-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h. Immunofluorescent staining on mouse lung was performed with M3A7 antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), as previously described (14Kalin N. Claass A. Sommer M. Puchelle E. Tummler B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Immunostaining for CFTR and RNA analysis of J4 mice expressing the normal hCFTR in the lung were reported previously (12Whitsett J.A. Dey C.R. Stripp B.R. Wikenheiser K.A. Clark J.C. Wert S.E.

Lung histology was performed on mice of all genotypes after inflation fixation at 25 cm in 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue was embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin using standard methods. RNA Microarray and Data Analysis—Microarray experiments were conducted to identify transcriptional responses caused by 1) expression of CFTRΔ508 in the Cftr-/- background (herein termed CFTRΔ508) and 2) increased expression of normal human CFTR in the lungs of wildtype mice (CFTRtg) under control of the human Sftpc promoter (J4 mice), as previously described (12Whitsett J.A.

RNA microarray findings were compared with previous data generated from the lungs of Cftr-/- mice (10Xu Y. Clark J.C. Aronow B.J. Dey C.R. Liu C. Wooldridge J.L. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol.

Three biological replicates were used for each comparison. Total lung RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using oligo(dT) with T7 promoter sequences attached, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis. Antisense cRNA was amplified and biotinylated using T7 RNA polymerase using protocols recommended by Affymetrix. Affymetrix MicroArray Suite version 5.0 was used to scan and quantitate intensity using default scan settings. Data were first normalized using RMA (Robust Multichip Average model) (15Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Normalized data were then further analyzed using Gene Spring 6.0 (Silicon Genetics, Inc.) and SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) (16Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9774) Google Scholar). Differentially expressed genes were identified by Student's t-test at p value ≤ 0.05 with estimates of false discovery rate ≤ 10% (SAM). In addition, Affymetrix “Present Call” in at least two of three replicates and coefficient of variation among replicates ≤ 50% were set as a requirement for gene selection. K-Means Clustering—Differentially expressed genes identified in lungs from CFTRΔ508 and Cftr-/- mice were mapped to the MOE430 genome base on the U74V2-MOE430 best match (www.affymetrix.com/support/) and compared with genes selected from RNAs from the SP-C-CFTRtg mice using modified Best K-Means clustering (Silicon Genetics BioScript 2.1) with Pearson's correlation as similarity measures. The number of clusters was chosen empirically based on the combination of percent variance explained (select k-Means results with higher percentage explained variability) and visual inspection. To control for age, Cftr-/- mice were compared with other genotypes at 6 weeks of age. Genes with no match between U74V2 and MOE430 were excluded from the cluster analysis. To reduce the background and ensure the clustering quality, only genes with detectable hybridization signals in the arrays from all three genotypes were used for clustering. The results are shown in supplemental Fig. S3 and supplemental Table SIII. Principal Component Analysis—Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using Spotfire DecisionSite 7.2 software (Spotfire, Inc.). Data were standardized using z-score calculation before PCA. The PCA scores corresponding to the first two components were plotted in a scatter plot in which the position along the axes shows the PCA score of the sample (see Fig. 3A). Functional Classification—Differentially expressed genes were classified into functional categories based on the gene ontology definition using publicly available web-based tools Onto-express and David (data base of annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery) (17Khatri P. Draghici S. Ostermeier G.C. Krawetz S.A. Genomics. 2002; 79: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 18Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A.

Overly represented functional categories were determined by Fisher Exact Test using corresponding murine genome as a reference dataset. Potential protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions were identified using Pathway Assist (Ariadne Genomics), a recently developed software application for analysis of biological pathways, regulatory networks, and protein interaction maps provided in a comprehensive data base termed ResNet. The current version of the data base contains over 500,000 biological interactions built by applying the MedScan text-mining algorithms to all PubMed abstracts. Promoter Analysis—Original genomic sequences and gene mapping information were downloaded from Ensemble (February, 2004 release). 2 kb upstream of exon 1 were identified and retrieved from human and mouse genome assemblies and used to form our promoter data base. Upstream sequences (2 kb) of differentially expressed genes were searched for over-represented cis-elements using MatInspector (Genomatix) vertebrate matrix library (supplemental Table SIV). Human and mouse promoters (-3to1kbrelative to exon 1) were compared using CisMols Analyzer, an internally developed program that identifies compositionally similar and phylogenetically conserved cis-element modules from a list of co-expressed genes (Results are shown in Figs. 6 and 7) (19Jegga A.G.

Both human CFTR and CFTRΔ508 cDNAs were available and well characterized. Because both are expressed in the early fetal lung, they are not likely to be seen as nonself proteins and therefore, are not likely to elicit autoimmune responses. There is no a prior expectation that the proteins (mouse versus human) will have distinct functions. Re-cloning mCFTR and mutations might introduce cryptic mutations that might complicate these studies further, therefore, we choose to use hCFTR and hCFTRΔ508 for this study. CFTRΔ508 mRNA was detected in RNA isolated from the lungs of CFTRΔ508 mice at levels similar to that of the endogenous murine CFTR, while the expression of hCFTR in the CFTRtg mice was increased. mCftr expression was not changed in the CFTRtg and CFTRΔ508/Cftr+/+ mice as compared with the Cftr+/+ mice (Fig. 1). When transfected into MLE15 cells in vitro, immunostaining for CFTRΔ508 was detected in a diffuse, non-membrane associated pattern. In contrast, staining of normal hCFTR was primarily membrane-associated (Fig. 2). CFTRΔ508 staining was detected in bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells of the transgenic SP-C-CFTRΔ508 mice, consistent with the abnormal trafficking of the CFTRΔ508 protein (Fig. 2). Lung histology and survival were not perturbed by the expression of CFTRΔ508 in the lungs of Cftr-/- or Cftr+/+ mice (supplemental Fig. S1). Both CFTRΔ508 and Cftr-/- mice were maintained in FABP-CFTRtg/tg backgrounds in which gastrointestinal function was corrected by expression of the normal CFTR in the gastrointestinal tract (11Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. DuVall M.D. Frizzell R.A. Whitsett J.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We sought to address two separate questions: 1) does CFTRΔ508 correct changes in mRNA expression caused by CFTR deficiency? and 2) does expression of CFTRΔ508 have unique effects on lung RNA expression in CFTR-deficient mice?FIGURE 2Immunofluorescent staining of CFTR and CFTRΔ508. Immunofluorescent staining for CFTR on lung sections of Cftr-/- mice (A) and CFTRΔ508 mice (B) indicated that CFTRΔ508 protein was present in bronchial epithelial cells. Immunostaining on MLE15 cells transfected with wild type Cftr (C) and SP-C-CFTRΔ508 (D) showed the lack of CFTRΔ508 staining on the apical surface of epithelial cells and diffuse cytoplasmic staining, indicating the lack of trafficking to the cell membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PCA was used as an exploratory, multivariant statistical tool to reduce data dimensions, filter noise, and extract the most significant patterns in the dataset. PCA was applied to triplicate biological samples, CFTRΔ508, Cftr-/-, and wild-type mice (Cftr+/+) at three different ages to determine the similarity/dissimilarity of each genotype on global mRNA expression profiles in the lung. Global gene expression patterns were most similar in Cftr-/- and CFTRΔ508 mice and distinct from Cftr+/+ mice (Fig. 3A). The expression profiles of genes differentially influenced by the lack of CFTR correlated closely with their corresponding changes in response to CFTRΔ508 expression (positive correlation of r = 0.85). Thus, the expression of CFTRΔ508 did not correct alterations in gene expression caused by the absence of CFTR (Fig. 3B). Transcriptional Response to CFTRΔ508—To identify lung RNAs influenced by expression of CFTRΔ508 in the respiratory epithelium and distinct from those related to lack of CFTR, lung RNAs from CFTRΔ508 mice were compared with those from Cftr-/- littermates. The mRNAs encoded by 65 distinct genes were significantly altered by expression of CFTRΔ508. Of these RNAs, 33 were increased while 32 were decreased. 36 genes were uniquely altered by CFTRΔ508 (those that were not different in Cftr-/- and Cftr+/+ mice). This set of RNAs was considered to be a reflection of the response to the expression of CFTRΔ508 in the lung (supplemental Table SI). Among the remaining 29 genes, 14 changed in the same direction in Cftr-/- and Cftr+/+ mice, indicating that CFTRΔ508 has more profound effect than the lack of CFTR (Cftr-/-) alone; 10 could not be determined due to a low hybridization signal or inconsistent changes among replicates; only 5 genes changed in opposite directions (up in Cftr-/- but down in the CFTRΔ508 or vice versa), and none of the 5 mRNAs changed by >1.5-fold (the largest change is seen in Cyp4v3, a cytochrome P450 family member, induced 2.5-fold by CFTRΔ508, but down-regulated -1.4-fold in response to Cftr-/-), indicating that there is no significant compensation by CFTRΔ508. Functional Categories of Genes Influenced by CFTRΔ508—The genes that were influenced by CFTRΔ508 were further assessed according to the Gene Ontology classification of biological process, and the Fisher Exact Test was used to calculate the probability that each category was over-represented in differentially expressed genes by comparing the data with the U74Av2 dataset as reference. The mRNAs defined within a group of genes responsive to “Heat/external Stimulus” (including Hspa8, Hspa2, Hspa1a, Dnaja1, Dnajb1, Ddit3, and Arnt) were the most overly represented (p = 0.001). RNAs included in “Cell Growth and Development” (Nup50, Igfbp5, Shc1, Ndr2, Xpo1, Ktn1, and Krt2-8) were decreased in response to CFTRΔ508 (p = 0.005). LightCycler analysis of lung mRNAs confirmed the changes in Hspa8 and Dnaja1, as well as the observed differences in Foxfla (supplemental Fig. S2). Genes and proteins that may interact with CFTR or with each other were identified by Pathway Assist (Ariadne Genomics), a recently developed software program application for analysis of biological pathways, gene regulation networks, and protein interactions (ResNet) (20Nikitin A. Egorov S. Daraselia N. Mazo I. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2155-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 21Novichkova S. Egorov S. Daraselia N. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1699-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interactions among the candidate genes and proteins influenced by CFTRΔ508 are shown in Fig. 4A. Genes encoding heat shock proteins/chaperones, ion transporters, and carriers and genes involved in regulation of intracellular redox state and phospholipid metabolism were significantly altered. Enhanced Expression of Genes Encoding Heat Shock Proteins/Chaperones—The “Heat shock proteins/chaperones” was the most significantly over-represented functional category induced by CFTRΔ508 that was linked directly or indirectly by known physical associations with CFTR. These findings are consistent with the concept that CFTRΔ508 is misfolded, misrouted, and/or degraded (5Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E.

Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones Hsc70, Hspa8, and Hsp40 (Dnaja1 and Dnajb1) are known to facilitate CFTR biogenesis. Hsc70 directly interacts with the NBD1 domain of CFTR to increase folding efficiency, retain misfolded CFTR in endoplasmic reticulum, and enhance its ubiquitination and degradation (23Fuller W. Cuthbert A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37462-37468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Hsp40 proteins (Dnaja1 and Dnajb1) are important co-chaperones with Hsc70 that facilitate the folding of CFTR. The expression of cytosolic chaperonin, Tcp1-ring complex (also called Tric or CCT), and peptidogylcan in the recognition protein (Pglyrp or Tag7) were decreased in response to CFTRΔ508. Both Hsc70 and Tcp1 mediate de novo protein folding and distinct and overlapping substrate specificity (25Frydman J. Hartl F.U. Science. 1996; 272: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 26Thulasiraman V. Yang C.F. Frydman J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Tag7 forms a stable 1:1 complex with Hsp70. Neither Hsp70 nor Tag7 are cytotoxic, but the complex induces apoptosis (27Sashchenko L.P. Dukhanina E.A. Yashin D.V. Shatalov Y.V. Romanova E.A. Korobko E.V. Demin A.V. Lukyanova T.I. Kabanova O.D. Khaidukov S.V. Kiselev S.L. Gabibov A.G. Gnuchev N.V. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2117-2124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, reduced expression of Tag7 may represent a protection mechanism against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. All of these chaperones (Hsc70, Dnaja1, Dnaja2, and Tcp-1) have been coprecipitated with nascent CFTR previously (28Meacham G.C. Lu Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson A. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Complex formation between CFTRΔ508 and Dnaja1/Hsc70 was greater than with wild-type CFTR, supporting the concept that Dnaja1/Hsc70 catalyzes CFTR folding, which may be defective in CFTRΔ508 (28Meacham G.C.

Peptides that inhibit bundle formation contributed significantly to the understanding of the entry mechanism of the virus. DP178, which partially overlaps C-terminal heptad repeats, prevents bundle formation through an undefined mechanism; additionally it has been suggested to bind other ENV regions and arrest fusion in an unknown manner. We used two structurally altered DP178 peptides; in each, two sequential amino acids were substituted into their d configuration, d-SQ in the hydrophilic N-terminal region and d-LW in the hydrophobic C-terminal. Importantly, we generated an elongated NHR peptide, N54, obtaining the full N-helix docking site for DP178. Interestingly, d-LW retained wild type fusion inhibitory activity, whereas d-SQ exhibited significantly reduced activity. In correlation with the inhibitory data, CD spectroscopy and fluorescence studies revealed that all the DP178 peptides interact with N54, albeit with different stabilities of the bundles. We conclude that strong binding of DP178 N-terminal region to the endogenous NHR, without significant contribution of the C-terminal sequence of DP178 to core formation, is vital for DP178 inhibition. The finding that d-amino acid incorporation in the C terminus did not affect activity or membrane binding as revealed by surface plasmon resonance correlates with an additional membrane binding site, or membrane anchoring role, for the C terminus, which works synergistically with the N terminus to inhibit fusion.

Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Peptides derived from the NHR and CHR regions of gp41 are known to inhibit HIV-1 fusion (4Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev.

Antiviral Res. 2001; 50: 95-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is believed that these fusion inhibitors bind their endogenous counterparts, blocking the progression from pre-hairpin to hairpin conformation, thereby arresting the fusion process. One of these peptides, DP178 (10Wild C. Greenwell T. Matthews T. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is currently part of HIV-1 treatment. The exact extent of the six-helix bundle structure in vivo is not known; in addition, it has never been demonstrated that DP178 can actually bind the NHR region and create a six-helix bundle. Therefore, although already in clinical use, the mode of inhibition by DP178 has yet to be proven. We synthesized two structurally altered DP178 peptides and their fluorescently labeled analogs (Fig. 1). To clarify the importance of NHR binding to the inhibitory activity of DP178, we synthesized d-SQ, which includes two sequential d-amino acids in the hydrophilic N-terminal region, and to examine whether the C-terminal region of DP178 participates in binding the NHR region we synthesized d-LW, which includes two sequential d-amino acids in the hydrophobic C-terminal sequence. We reasoned that: (i) structural alterations in d-SQ will reduce its inhibitory activity by compromising its ability to bind the NHR region and create the six-helix bundle structure, and (ii) if the C-terminal part also participates in binding the NHR region then structural alterations in it will significantly reduce the inhibitory activity of the peptide as well. Importantly, we synthesized an elongated N-peptide, N54, to obtain the full docking site for DP178. We examined the inhibitory activity of the peptides by a cell-cell fusion assay and used biophysical methods to investigate their ability to bind N54 and the stabilities of these interactions. Because the C-terminal part of DP178 has been implicated in membrane binding (11Kliger Y. Gallo S.A. Peisajovich S.G. Munoz-Barroso I. Avkin S. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the effect of d-amino acid incorporation on the peptides binding to phospholipid membranes was also examined by using surface plasmon resonance. The results are discussed in view of the differences in the ability of DP178 N- and C-terminal regions to endure structural alterations that affect binding to the N-helix and fusion inhibition activity. Materials—Boc and Fmoc amino acids, Boc methylbenzhydrylamine resin and Fmoc Rink Amide methylbenzhydrylamine resin, were purchased from Nova-Biochem AG (Laufelfinger, Switzerland). Other peptide synthesis reagents, phospholipids, cholesterol (N-[2-hydroxyethyl] piperazine-N′-[2-ethanesulfonic acid]), and N-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared using double-glass-distilled water. Phosphate-buffered saline was composed of NaCl (8 g/liter), KCL (0.2 g/liter), KH2PO4 (0.2 g/liter), and Na2HPO4 (1.09 g/liter) at pH 7.3. Hepes buffer was composed of 5 mm (N-[2-hydroxyethyl] piperazine-N′-[2-ethanesulfonic acid]) at pH 7.0. Cell Lines and Reagents—Cell culture reagents and media were from Invitrogen. Steady-Glow Luciferase detection kit was from Promega (Madison, WI). HL2/3 cells (12Ciminale V. Felber B.K. Campbell M. Pavlakis G.N. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (a HeLa cell line) expressing cleaved HIV-1 molecular clone HXB2/3gpt (containing HIV-1 Gag, Env, Tat, Rev, and Nef proteins) were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program from Dr. Barbara Felber and Dr. George Pavlakis. The TZM-bl indicator HeLa cell line (13Wei X. Decker J.M. Liu H. Zhang Z. Arani R.B. Kilby J.M. Saag M.S. Wu X. Shaw G.M. Kappes J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar), which expresses high levels of CD4 and CCR5 along with endogenously expressed CXCR4, was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health from Dr. John C. Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyun Wu, and Tranzyme Inc. The cells were cultured every 3–4 days by trypsinization and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Peptide Synthesis—DP178wt, d-LW, N54, and C34 were synthesized on Rink Amide MBHA resin by using the Fmoc strategy as previously described (14Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). They were cleaved from the resin by a trifluoroacetic acid:double distilled water:TES:thioanisole (91.2:4.8:2:2 (v/v)) mixture. d-SQ was synthesized on MHBA resin using BOC chemistry as described (14Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 15Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The BOC peptide was cleaved from the resin by HF. All the peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography to >95% homogeneity. The molecular weight of the peptides was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Fluorescent Labeling of the Peptides—Resin-bound peptides, with their amino acid side chains fully protected, were deprotected from their N terminus protecting group and reacted with the rhodamine (emission-580 excitation-530) fluorescent probe in N,N-dimethylformamide + 2% N,N-Diisopropylethylamine solution in an overnight reaction (16Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6502-6509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage and purification were performed according to the synthesis method. Preparation of Large and Small Unilamellar Vesicles—Thin films of PC and cholesterol at a molar ratio of 9:1, respectively, were generated after dissolving the lipids in a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of CHCL3/MeOH and drying under a stream of nitrogen gas while rotating. The films were lyophilized overnight, sealed with argon gas to prevent oxidation of the lipids, and stored at –20 °C. Before the experiments, films were suspended in the appropriate buffer and vortexed for 1.5 min. The lipid suspension underwent five cycles of freezing-thawing and extrusion through polycarbonate membranes with 1- and 0.2-μm diameter pores to create large unilamellar vesicles. To prepare small unilamellar vesicles, the films were dissolved in the appropriate buffer, vortexed for 1.5 min, sonicated as previously described (17Gazit E. Lee W.J. Brey P.T. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10681-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and diluted to 0.5 mm. Fusion Assay—Fusion was monitored using a reporter gene assay based on activation of HIV long terminal repeat-driven luciferase cassette in TZM-bl (target) cells by HIV-1 tat from the HL2/3 (effector) cells. We performed fusion assay in a serum-free medium to minimize nonspecific association of peptides with serum proteins. The peptides were solubilized in Me2SO at various dilutions. The TZM-bl cells, plated in 96-well clusters (2 × 104/well) overnight at 37 °C, were placed in 50 μl of serum-free medium/well prior to fusion assays. The target cells were co-cultured with 50 μl of HL2/3 cells (2 × 104/well in serum-free medium) for 4–6 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of various concentrations of DP178 peptides (1 μl of peptide/well). Efficiency of fusion was determined by measuring luciferase activity in the wells following the manufacturer's instructions using the steady-glow luciferase determination kit (Promega). The light intensity was measured using a Reporter luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Background luminescence in TZM-bl cells was determined without addition of HL2/3 cells. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD measurements were performed on an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter. The spectra were scanned using a thermostatic quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 mm. Wavelength scans were performed at 25 °C, recording time was 20 s in 1-nm steps in the range of 190–260 nm. For thermal denaturation the cores were created at 5 °C and measured in the range of 5–99 °C, 2 degrees/min rate of change, 2-min equilibration time, 2-degree steps, and 20-s recording time. Peptides and peptide mixtures (1:1 molar ratio) were scanned at a concentration of 10 μm in Hepes buffer. DP178-N54 Interaction, Stability, and Competition Experiments Using Fluorescently Labeled Peptides—Interaction between the NHR region and DP178 was measured using rhodamine (Rho)-labeled peptides. A labeled DP178 peptide (Rho-DP178/Rho-d-LW/Rho-d-SQ) was dissolved and incubated, and its fluorescence was measured. Then, a 1:1 molar ratio mixture was prepared between the labeled DP178 peptide and N54 and incubated, and the fluorescence was measured. To examine six-helix bundle stability, competition experiments were performed. First, a 1:1 molar ratio mixture was prepared between the labeled DP178 peptide and N54. After incubation the peptide mixture was transferred to a 5-fold molar excess of unlabeled DP178/C34 peptide and incubated, and the fluorescence was measured. All fluorescence measurements were recorded before and after the addition of proteinase K (utilized in order to follow the kinetics of degradation) and followed for 10–15 min. All reactions were in Hepes buffer, and all measurements were performed at room temperature on a SLM-AMINCO Bowman series 2-luminescence spectrometer. Excitation was set at 530 nm, emission at 580 nm, band paths were 8 nm, and the voltage was 750/800 V. Binding Analysis by Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor—Biosensor experiments were carried out with a BIAcore X analytical system 3000 (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) using L1 sensor chip (BIAcore) at 25 °C. The chip contains hydrophobic aliphatic chains that include exposed polar headgroups. The applied small unilamellar vesicles interact with the polar headgroups, resulting in a bilayer lipid surface. The alterations applied to a previously described protocol (18Mozsolits H. Wirth H.J. Werkmeister J. Aguilar M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1512: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Papo N. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar): 1) peptide solutions were 0.6–10 μm; 2) peptide solutions of 75–100 μl were injected at a 5 μl/min flow rate; 3) phosphate-buffered saline was the running and dissolving buffer. Dissociation was performed with only the running buffer, and the time corresponded to the specific peptide and its concentration. Surface plasmon resonance detects changes in the refractive index of the surface layer in contact with the sensor chip. Sensograms were obtained by plotting the response units against time. The peptide-lipid binding event was analyzed from a series of sensograms collected at five different peptide concentrations by curve fitting using numerical integration analysis (20Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Chaiken I.M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Two curve-fitting algorithms (the two-state and the 1:1 reaction models) were explored. The data were analyzed by independently fitting each sensogram obtained with the different concentrations. Inhibition of HIV-1 gp41-mediated Cell-Cell Fusion by DP178 Peptides—The inhibitory activity of the different DP178 peptides was examined by a cell-cell fusion assay (Fig. 2). DP178wt and d-LW had very similar inhibitory activity, whereas d-SQ had significantly reduced activity; IC50 values were 48.9, 90.7, and 1710 nm, respectively. We conclude that substitution to d-amino acids in the region presumed to participate in NHR binding significantly reduces the inhibitory activity of DP178, whereas substitution in the C-terminal region reduces the activity only slightly. Interaction between the DP178 Peptides and N54 and Its Stability Determined by CD Spectroscopy—To find out the reason for the differences in the inhibitory activities of the three C-peptides, we tested their capacity to bind the N-heptad repeat utilizing CD spectroscopy. The interaction between peptides can be assessed by comparing the spectrum of the mixed peptides (experimental signal) with the average spectrum of each peptide alone (non-interacting signal) (21Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway Jr., S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Kliger Y. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The two signals are identical if the peptides do not interact with each other. When the peptides were measured alone, N54 exhibited α-helical signal whereas the C-peptides were predominantly unstructured (data not shown). Their “non-interacting” signals are presented in Fig. 3A by the gray curves. The actual experimental signal for each peptide mixture, recorded following the C and N peptide co-incubation, is presented in Fig. 3A by the black curves. In comparison with the non-interacting signals, the experimental signals of all the peptide mixtures demonstrated induction of α-helical signal (probably due to secondary structure induction of the C-peptides), indicating interaction between the C-peptides (C34 and the three DP178 peptides) with N54. These results correlate with the creation of six-helix bundle structures (21Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway Jr., S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Liu S. Lu H. Niu J. Xu Y. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). The highest induction of α-helical signal was observed for the C34+N54 mixture (measured as a positive control), whereas the lowest induction was observed for the d-SQ +N54 mixture. We used as a negative control the combination between N54 and an unrelated peptide, GCN4 helical mutant. The data shown in the inset of Fig. 3A demonstrate that the experimental and non-interacting signals are identical. A similar result was obtained following the co-incubation of DP178wt with GCN4 helical mutant (figure not shown). To test the stabilities of the different bundles we performed thermal denaturation. The peptide mixtures were incubated, and their signal at 222 nm was monitored while the temperature was slowly raised. The melting curves for the three peptide mixtures are presented in Fig. 3B. The Tm for the N54 mixtures with DP178wt, d-LW, and d-SQ were ∼58.5, 55, and 51 °C, respectively. To conclude, all the C-peptides examined interact with N54, probably creating a six-helix bundle structure, albeit with different stabilities. DP178 Peptides and N54 Interaction and Stability Determined by Utilizing Fluorescently Labeled Peptides—To further confirm our CD results, the different DP178 peptides were labeled with rhodamine, a fluorescent probe known to undergo self quenching. Rhodamine labeling does not interfere with the function of DP178. We measured the fluorescence, before and after the addition of proteinase K, of rhodamine-labeled C-peptides alone and of preincubated peptide mixtures between labeled C-peptides and N54. We reasoned that the C-peptides interacting with N54 peptides, creating a bundle structure, would have reduced initial fluorescence due to higher proximity of the fluorescent probes. In addition, their cleavage by proteinase K would be slower in comparison with the C-peptides alone, because the interaction with the N54 would partially protect them. As shown in Fig. 4, the signals of the C-peptides alone reveal that they are all partially aggregated in solution. DP178wt aggregated to the highest degree; nevertheless, all the peptides were cleaved readily and almost immediately by the enzyme, as illustrated by the sudden increase of the signal following the addition of the enzyme. When each C-peptide+N54 mixture was measured, we observed an initial quenching of the signal, indicating interaction. Following enzyme addition, the d-SQ +N54 mixture exhibited the highest initial fluorescence increase and the fastest degradation kinetics, whereas the DP178wt+N54 and d-LW +N54 mixtures exhibited intermediate behavior. The C34+N54 mixture, analyzed as a control for a known stable six-helix bundle, demonstrated the smallest initial fluorescence increase and the slowest kinetic degradation. Thus, all the C-peptides interact with N54, albeit with different stabilities. Exploring DP178 Peptides and N54 Interaction and Stability by Performing Competition Experiments with Fluorescently Labeled Peptides—To further clarify the differences in the stabilities of the different peptide bundles created by the different DP178 peptides, a competition strategy was employed. First, we incubated a labeled DP178 peptide with N54, and then a five molar excess of unlabeled DP178wt was added. Following incubation, the fluorescence before and after the addition of proteinase K was measured. We reasoned that the level of labeled DP178 peptides displaced would depend on the stability of the original bundle created. The results are presented in Fig. 5A. The labeled DP178wt+N54 mixture gives the same fluorescence signal with or without excess unlabeled DP178, indicating that DP178wt interacts strongly with N54, hardly allowing its replacement. In contrast, the initial fluorescence of the labeled d-SQ +N54 with excess unlabeled DP178 mixture is significantly higher than without the peptide, demonstrating displacement of the labeled d-SQ peptide by unlabeled DP178wt peptide. Moreover, there was an initial high increase of the signal, as well as faster kinetics of degradation following the addition of the enzyme. Taken together, these observations support the conclusion that the d-SQ +N54 interaction is less stable than DP178wt+N54. The d-LW +N54 mixture demonstrated an intermediate state. The initial signal had an intermediate intensity; nevertheless, its degradation kinetics more resembled the pattern displayed by DP178wt+N54. To verify our results, we performed competition experiments again, with an excess of unlabeled C34 peptide (which overlaps the N-terminal sequence of DP178), and the same pattern was revealed (Fig. 5B). Thus, we conclude that the interaction between N54 and the DP178 peptides differs in its stability, specified from the most stable to the least: DP178wt, d-LW, and d-SQ. Binding of the Peptides to PC/Chol Membranes Determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance—The C-terminal region of DP178 is vital for its activity (21Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway Jr., S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), and it presumably involves membrane binding (11Kliger Y. Gallo S.A. Peisajovich S.G. Munoz-Barroso I. Avkin S. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To examine whether the structural alterations in this region influenced the ability of the peptides to bind membranes, we performed a binding assay using a BIAcore biosensor. The DP178 peptides at varying concentrations of 0.6 to 10 μm were allowed to interact with PC/Chol bilayers on the surface of an L1 chip. The profiles of the different peptide sensograms were very similar, indicating similar binding capabilities (Fig. 6). For quantitative results we analyzed each sensogram alone by curve fitting using numerical integration analysis (20Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Chaiken I.M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We attempted analysis with two different reaction models; the “1:1” reaction model asserts only one step, which involves binding of the peptide to the lipids, whereas the “two-state reaction” model asserts an additional step involving either aggregation or partial insertion of the peptide into the lipid bilayer (19Papo N. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The model that exhibited the best fit and the highest consistency was the 1:1 binding reaction model; based on it, binding constants were determined: KA (m–1) = (3.64 ± 0.84) × 105, (8.85 ± 0.56) × 105, and (1.74 ± 0.29) × 105 for DP178wt, d-LW, and d-SQ, respectively. The binding constants are very similar, therefore revealing that structural alterations in the C-terminal region of DP178 do not influence the ability of the region to interact with membranes. The discovery of fusion inhibitors led to the current accepted fusion model, demonstrating the utility of fusion inhibitors as tools for deciphering HIV-1 fusion mechanism. In this study, by utilizing DP178 diastereomeric peptides and DP178 full docking site, we were able to demonstrate the importance of the interaction with the NHR region, and the stability of the bundle formed, to the inhibitory activity of DP178. It has been implicated that DP178 has an additional mode of action involving its C terminus, as will be elaborated below, and that this region has a helical structure (25Biron Z. Khare S. Samson A.O. Hayek Y. Naider F. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12687-12696Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The purpose of the study was to distinguish between the contributions of the different regions to the inhibitory activity of DP178. Therefore, we chose residues in the C- and N-terminals for substitution to their d-amino acid counterparts. In the d-SQ mutant the specific location was chosen because the serine residue is known to disrupt the stability of the N36+C34 six-helix bundle (26Wang S. York J. Shu W. Stoller M.O. Nunberg J.H. Lu M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7283-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The d-amino acids in the d-LW mutant replaced known hydrophobic residues that are critical for its inhibitory activity (21Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway Jr., S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because it has been demonstrated previously that insertion of d-amino acids into peptides disrupts their helical structure (27Pouny Y. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9482-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we can assume that the DP178 mutants are structurally altered. Interestingly, when the activity of the DP178 peptides was analyzed by a cell-cell fusion assay, we found that d-LW exhibited similar inhibitory activity to DP178wt despite the presence of two d-amino acids, whereas the activity of d-SQ was significantly reduced. By using CD spectroscopy and by utilizing fluorescently labeled C-peptides, we show that all the DP178 peptides interact with an elongated N-peptide, N54, and form bundles. However, the stabilities of the various bundles (also observed by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3) and by fluorescently labeled C-peptides (Figs. 4, 5)), demonstrated a gradient in which DP178wt forms the most stable complex, followed by d-LW, and d-SQ. The considerable reduction in the inhibitory activity of d-SQ, combined with its reduced bundle stability, demonstrates the importance of the interaction and its stability between the N-terminal region of DP178 and the NHR to DP178wt inhibitory activity. In contrast, interfering with the structure of the C-terminal region of DP178 in d-LW results in a slight reduction in inhibitory activity combined with intermediate bundle stability. Therefore, we suggest that this region enlarges the interacting interface without participating in the six-helix bundle complex. However, the fluorescence studies showed a difference between the stabilities of DP178wt and d-LW bundles that should probably affect the inhibitory activity more than 2-fold. This might suggest that in the presence of cells there is an additional target for the C-terminal part of DP178 as elaborated below. Accumulating evidence suggests that DP178 has an additional inhibitory mode of action involving its C-terminal region and membrane binding (11Kliger Y. Gallo S.A. Peisajovich S.G. Munoz-Barroso I. Avkin S. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Liu S. Lu H. Niu J. Xu Y. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol.

Suh M.J. Yoo Y.S. Yoon S.H. Woo E.R. Yu Y.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The membrane binding can refer to specific binding interactions or simply anchoring to the membrane. This alternative mode of action might involve interfering with aggregation of gp41 trimers (by binding the pre-transmembrane region region), thus preventing pore expansion and arresting the fusion process. Membrane binding experiments were performed to examine whether the insertion of d-amino acids in the C-terminal region of DP178 resulted in reduced membrane binding ability. The DP178 peptides exhibited very similar affinities to PC:Chol membranes as measured by surface plasmon resonance. Taking into account previous reports demonstrating that incorporation of d-amino acids within membrane-bound peptides do not significantly affect their structure in the membrane or their ability to recognize their counterpart (30Gerber D. Sal-Man N. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Gerber D. Pritsker M. Gunther-Ausborn S. Johnson B. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48224-48230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Sal-Man N. Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we attribute the inhibitory activity contribution of the C-terminal region to structural tolerance of the C terminus of DP178 when bound to the cell membrane. Interestingly, differences in the aggregation states of the isolated DP178 peptides in solution were also detected. The diastereomeric peptides demonstrated reduced aggregation in comparison to DP178wt (Fig. 4). This observation might have important therapeutic implications because one of the major problems involving treatment with DP178 is its fast aggregation complicating its administration and efficacy. Stability of the six-helix bundle has traditionally been assessed using N36+C34 combinations, specifically with respect to binding of C34 to the pocket in the NHR trimer. However, the N36+C34 do not provide complete answers to the issue of six-helix bundle stability because other regions may also be involved. For instance, N51+C43 six-helix bundle has a much higher melting temperature than the N36+C34 counterpart (33Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). We found in this study that stable bundles could be formed between N54 and DP178, although DP178 does not include the residues that bind the pocket. Because we were interested in the effects of DP178 mutations close to the membrane proximal region, we used the N54+DP178 complexes as our base line. Creation of a six-helix bundle structure between DP178 and N-peptides has not been shown directly to date. In 1996, Lawless et al. (21Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway Jr., S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) demonstrated, by CD, interaction of DP178 with another N-peptide, DP107 (illustrated in Fig. 7), but their CD results included reduction of the experimental signal in comparison to the non-interactive signal. Another study (23Liu S. Lu H. Niu J. Xu Y. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar) examined six-helix bundle creation between DP178 and four different N-peptides (illustrated in Fig. 7). N36-F10+DP178 exhibited a small induction of the experimental signal, whereas DP107+DP178 (similarly to Lawless et al., Ref. 21Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway Jr., S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and N46+DP178 exhibited reduction of the experimental signal. Liu et al. also verified their CD results by fluorescent native gels and concluded that DP178 binds the N-terminal side of the NHR region, but only to a weak extent, and that the interaction with the N-peptides mainly creates insoluble complexes. Our data emphasize the importance of obtaining the full overlap between the N- and the DP178 peptides to obtain a soluble, stable bundle. When DP178wt (Fig. 5) or C34 (data not shown) interacts with N54, the C-peptide is hardly displaced by exogenous addition of C-peptides. In contrast, when the initial interaction is created with one of the two diastereomers, it can be displaced, and the extent of displacement is dependent on the position of the d-amino acids. This phenomenon can explain the time window of DP178 activity; it can inhibit HIV-1 fusion after exposure of the prehairpin conformation, but before creation of the hairpin conformation, because it cannot displace the endogenous CHR once the six-helix bundle complex has been formed (22Kliger Y. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Taken together, we conclude that strong binding of DP178 N-terminal to the endogenous NHR region, without significant contribution of the C-terminal sequence of DP178 in core formation, is vital for DP178 inhibition. In addition, the finding that d-amino acid incorporation in the C terminus did not significantly affect the activity correlates with an additional membrane binding site, or membrane anchoring role, for the C terminus of DP178 that works synergistically with the N terminus to inhibit fusion.

Xenobiotic compounds such as polycyclic and heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons possess toxic activity and recalcitrance. The great plasticity and metabolic versatility of bacteria allow them to acquire the necessary catabolic capacities to degrade recalcitrant compounds, contributed by the construction of catabolic operons by the patchwork assembly of pre-existing gene variants through gene recruitment and rearrangement (1van der Meer J.R. de Vos W.M. Harayama S. Zehnder A.J.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 677-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulators and regulated promoters are key elements that permit catabolic operons to be transcribed only when required at a level adequate to satisfy a metabolic return from the compound. Prokaryotic transcriptional regulators that control catabolic operons for aromatic compounds are categorized into several families (2Díaz E. Prieto M.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Carbazole is a dioxin-like recalcitrant compound with a dibenzopyrrole ring. The carbazole catabolic car gene cluster was first cloned from Pseudomonas resinovorans CA10 (3Sato S. Nam J.-W. Kasuga K. Nojiri H. Yamane H. Omori T. J.

Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 1467-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Via the upper carbazole catabolic pathway, carbazole is degraded to anthranilate and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate by carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase, meta-cleavage enzyme, and hydrolase (see Fig. 1A) (3Sato S. Nam J.-W. Kasuga K. Nojiri H. Yamane H. Omori T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4850-4858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sato S. Ouchiyama N. Kimura T. Nojiri H. Yamane H. Omori T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4841-4849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then, anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase converts anthranilate to generate catechol, which is further degraded to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates via the β-ketoadipate pathway (7Nojiri H. Maeda K. Sekiguchi H. Urata M. Shintani M. Yoshida T. Habe H. Omori T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldorase, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes degrade 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA (the meta pathway) (8Nojiri H. Sekiguchi H. Maeda K. Urata M. Nakai S. Yoshida T. Habe H. Omori T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3663-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In P. resinovorans CA10, the upper and meta pathway enzymes are encoded by the carCA10 gene cluster (carAaAaBaBbCAcAdDFECA10), where the carAa gene is duplicated (see Fig. 1B). Anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase is encoded by the antABC operon. Previous study has shown that the Pant promoter drives the transcription of ant operon and an AraC/XylS family (9Gallegos M.T. Schleif R. Bairoch A. Hofmann K. Ramos J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) activator AntR stimulates Pant in the presence of anthranilate (10Urata M. Miyakoshi M. Kai S. Maeda K. Habe H. Omori T. Yamane H. Nojiri H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6815-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both carCA10 and ant structural genes and the regulatory gene antR are carried on a 199,035-bp IncP-7 plasmid pCAR1, whose entire nucleotide sequence has been recently determined (11Maeda K. Nojiri H. Shintani M. Yoshida T. Habe H. Omori T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence analysis of other car gene clusters and their flanking regions has shown evolutionary trails of gene recruitment and rearrangement (6Inoue K. Widada J. Nakai S. Endoh T. Urata M.

Notably, the carJ3 gene cluster (carAaBaB-bCAcAdDJ3) that was isolated from Janthinobacterium sp. J3 shows 94.3% nucleotide sequence identity to the carCA10 gene cluster in the structural and intergenic DNA regions. High similarities in deduced amino acid sequence suggests no differences in functions of Car enzymes between CA10 and J3, which is proven in part by enzymatic and structural studies of CarAa and hydrolase proteins (12Nojiri H.

As the Pant promoter is located within the transposed region, the second copy of the Pant promoter also functions to drive transcription of the downstream carCA10 gene cluster (10Urata M. Miyakoshi M. Kai S. Maeda K. Habe H. Omori T. Yamane H. Nojiri H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6815-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Instead, upstream of the carJ3 gene cluster, a putative regulatory gene carRJ3, which belongs to the GntR family (14Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 63: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and shows relatively high similarities to FadR subfamily transcriptional regulators among the GntR family (15Rigali S. Derouaux A. Giannotta F. Dusart J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12507-12515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), is located in a divergent direction. Furthermore, the carFE genes do not exist downstream of the carJ3 gene cluster. From these observations, the carJ3 gene cluster is probably an ancestral form of the carCA10 gene cluster before the transposition of ISPre1, the recruitment of carFE, and the duplication of carAa. Owing to high evolutionary relationship between the carCA10 and carJ3 gene clusters, we aimed to characterize regulatory elements of the carCA10 and carJ3 operons and to compare their effectiveness experimentally. In this study, the developmental process of car operon was clearly explained by the acquisition of the Pant promoter via the transposition of ISPre1, which resulted in the alteration of the regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, this study provides a unique property of the CarRJ3 repressor in binding to its operators.

Biochem. 1993; 57: 455-460Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and P. resinovorans CA10dm1, a carbazole-deficient mutant of strain CA10 that lacks the carAaAaBaBbCAcAdDFECA10 genes (10Urata M. Miyakoshi M. Kai S. Maeda K. Habe H. Omori T. Yamane H. Nojiri H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6815-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), were used for transcriptional analyses. Escherichia coli DH5α (Toyobo) was used for cloning experiments. E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used for protein overproduction. The plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. P. resinovorans strains were routinely grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (17Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) or MM1 (per liter: 2.2 g of Na2HPO4, 0.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of NH4NO3, 0.2 g of MgSO4 ·6H2O, 0.01 g of FeSO4 ·7H2O, 0.01 g of CaCl2 ·2H2O, and 0.05 g of yeast extract). Carbazole was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 100 mg/ml followed by sterilization with a 0.2-μm pore-size membrane filter (8Nojiri H. Sekiguchi H. Maeda K. Urata M. Nakai S. Yoshida T. Habe H. Omori T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3663-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and 1% of this solution was added to MM1. E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in LB medium or 2× YT medium (per liter, 10 g of yeast extract, 16 g of bactotryptone, and 5 g of NaCl) (17Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). When appropriate, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; gentamicin, 15 μg/ml; and kanamycin, 50 μg/ml. For plate cultures, the above media were solidified with 1.6% agar (w/v). DNA Manipulation—Transformation of E. coli cells, plasmid preparation from E. coli cells, restriction enzyme digestion, and DNA ligation were carried out according to standard protocols (17Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). P. resinovorans strains were transformed by electroporation using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) (10Urata M. Miyakoshi M. Kai S. Maeda K. Habe H. Omori T. Yamane H. Nojiri H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6815-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S2. Construction of Plasmids—A promoter search vector pME4510 (18Rist M. Kertesz M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 169: 179-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested at the HindIII/SfiI sites to replace the lacZ reporter gene with a 1.7-kbp HindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the luc+NF reporter gene from pSP-luc+NF (Promega), to yield pMEGluc. A series of transcriptional fusion plasmids, pMC375 through pMC1094, was constructed as follows: DNA fragments containing the region upstream of carAaCA10 were amplified from pBCA721 (8Nojiri H. Sekiguchi H. Maeda K. Urata M. Nakai S. Yoshida T. Habe H. Omori T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3663-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with a series of forward primers, CARAA-F-BamHI-375 through CARAA-F-BamHI-1094, and a reverse primer CARAA-R-HindIII, which added appropriate restriction sites and a ribosome binding site for the luc+NF gene. The BamHI-HindIII fragment of the amplified DNA was ligated to the corresponding site of pMEGluc, to yield pMC375 through pMC1094. pMC2065, containing the 2065-bp region just upstream of the carAaCA10 translation start point up to –200 relative to the transcription start point of ORF9, was constructed as described above using the primer pair ANTA-F-BamHI-253 (10Urata M. Miyakoshi M. Kai S. Maeda K. Habe H. Omori T. Yamane H. Nojiri H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6815-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and CARAA-R-HindIII. pMJ1345R was constructed by ligation of the 2.6-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment (carrying carRJ3) from pBJ3101 (6Inoue K. Widada J. Nakai S. Endoh T. Urata M. Ashikawa Y. Shintani M. Saiki Y. Yoshida T. Habe H. Omori T. Nojiri H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 1467-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) along with the 572-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment upstream of carAaJ3, which was amplified by PCR from pBJ3101 by the method described above, to the BamHI/HindIII-digested pMEluc. pMJ1345–1066 was constructed by cloning the 279-bp PstI-HindIII fragment upstream of ORFU13, which was amplified using CARAA-F-PstI-1345 and CARAA-R-HindIII-1066 from pBJ3101, to the corresponding site of pMEluc. pMJ1345–1066R was constructed by cloning of the same 279-bp PstI-HindIII fragment along with a 1.8-kb BamHI-PstI fragment carrying carRJ3 from pBJ3101 to the BamHI/HindIII-digested pMEGluc. Nucleotide sequences of the PCR-amplified fragments were confirmed to be identical with the reference sequences. To overexpress CarRJ3 with a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus (C-ht-CarRJ3: CarRJ3-AlaAlaAlaLeuGluHis6) in E. coli BL21(DE3), pEJChtCarR was constructed as follows: carRJ3 was amplified from pBJ3101 (6Inoue K. Widada J. Nakai S. Endoh T. Urata M. Ashikawa Y. Shintani M. Saiki Y. Yoshida T. Habe H. Omori T. Nojiri H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 1467-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with CARRJ3-F-NdeI and CARRJ3-R-NotI primers, adding appropriate restriction sites. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. The 764-bp NdeI-NotI fragment from the PCR product was cloned into the corresponding site of pET-26b (Novagen), to yield pEJChtCarR. To accumulate intermediates of the upper catabolic pathway, a series of plasmids, pBRJ3001, pBRJ3001ΔBbC, and pBRJ3001ΔC, was constructed and used to transform P. resinovorans CA10dm1. The 1.7-kb PstI fragment within the carBa-carC region or the 56-bp AatI-PmaCI fragment within the carC gene was deleted by self-ligation from the 5.6-kb EcoRI fragment of carAaBaBbCAcAdJ3 on pBJ3001 (6Inoue K. Widada J. Nakai S. Endoh T. Urata M. Ashikawa Y. Shintani M. Saiki Y. Yoshida T. Habe H. Omori T. Nojiri H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 1467-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), to yield pBJ3001ΔBbC or pBJ3001ΔC, respectively. Then, the EcoRI fragment of pBJ3001, pBJ3001ΔBbC, or pBJ3001ΔC was cloned into pBBR1MCS-2 (19Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop II R.M. Peterson K.M. Gene. 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar) in the same direction as the tac promoter, to yield pBRJ3001, pBRJ3001ΔBbC, or pBRJ3001ΔC, respectively. Induction—Cells of P. resinovorans CA10 or its derivatives grown overnight in LB medium were washed twice with CNF buffer (per liter: 2.2 g of Na2HPO4, 0.8 g of KH2PO4) and resuspended in the same volume of CNF buffer. MM1 supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml of ammonium succinate as a carbon and nitrogen source and with or without 0.02 mg/ml carbazole as an inducer was inoculated with one-tenth volume of cell suspension and incubated at 30 °C with reciprocal shaking (300 strokes/min). Reverse Transcription-PCR—After a 2-h induction, total RNA was prepared from CA10 cells using NucleoSpin RNAII (Macherey-Nagel). For semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, the first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA with the specific primer CARE-12R by SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 55 °C for 60 min and diluted with 9 volumes of H2O. PCR was performed in a 25-μl mixture containing 1 μl of the diluted cDNA solution and 0.4 μm of the primer set with cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The optimal number of cycles was selected for each amplified fragment. The following primer sets were used for PCR (supplemental Table S2): ORF9-carAa (1167 bp), ORF9–13F and CARAA-11R; carAa-carBa (1231 bp), CARAA-3F and CARBA-15R; carBa-carAc (2051 bp), CARBA-4F and CARAC-7R; carAc-carD (2121 bp), CARAC-2F and CARD-8R; carD-ORF33 (1100 bp), CARD-3F and ORF33–10R; ORF33-carF (1509 bp), ORF33–8F and CARF-3R; and carF-carE (1710 bp), CARF-1F and CARE-12R. As an internal reference, a 1061-bp DNA was amplified with the primer pair 16S-2F and 16S-13R from the cDNA synthesized from 16S ribosomal rRNA with 16S-13R. As a negative control, the reverse transcription reaction mixture without SuperScript III reverse transcriptase was used for PCR. The PCR products were analyzed by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. Luciferase Reporter Assay—After induction for the appropriate time, cells of P. resinovorans CA10 or CA10dm1 containing the reporter plasmid (supplemental Table S1) were harvested by centrifugation (2400 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and were broken by ultrasonic treatment in sonication buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The supernatant was collected by centrifugation (21,600 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The relative light units (RLUs) of 1 μg of total protein was measured using a Centro LB960 (Berthold Technologies) according to the method described previously (10Urata M. Miyakoshi M. Kai S. Maeda K. Habe H. Omori T. Yamane H. Nojiri H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6815-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Each sample was assayed independently at least three times. The induction rate was defined as the ratio of luciferase activity (RLU/μg) of cells after induction in the presence of carbazole to that in its absence. Primer Extension—Total RNA was prepared from cells of P. resinovorans CA10 or those containing pMJ1345R induced for 2 h, using NucleoSpin RNA II. 2 pmol of the IRD800-labeled specific primer (ORF9 –13R, ORFU13–2, and CARR-1) was annealed to 10 μg of total RNA after denaturation at 65 °C for 5 min and was extended using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 55 °C for 30 min. The extended product was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and was then dissolved in 2 μl of H2O and 1 μl of IR2 stop solution (Li-Cor). The solution was denatured at 95 °C for 2 min and subjected to electrophoresis using a Li-Cor model 4200L-2 auto-DNA sequencer (Li-Cor) together with the sequence ladder obtained using the same primer. Overproduction and Purification of C-ht-CarRJ3—E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pEJChtCarR was grown overnight in 2× YT medium, and then 5 ml of the same medium was inoculated with 100 μl of overnight culture. After incubation at 30 °C with reciprocal shaking at 300 strokes/min for 3 h, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.2 μm, and gene expression was induced at 30 °C for 3 h. After induction, the cells were collected by centrifugation (3,300 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and broken by ultrasonic treatment in sonication buffer. The supernatant was then collected by centrifugation (21,600 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and subjected to metal chelation chromatography using the QuickPick IMAC metal affinity kit (Bio-Nobile) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified protein sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. DNase I Footprinting—DNase I footprinting was performed as described by Endoh et al. (20Endoh T. Habe H. Nojiri H. Yamane H. Omori T. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A 276-bp DNA region spanning from –193 to +83 relative to the transcription start point of ORFU13 was amplified by PCR with the primer pairs 5′-biotin-labeled ORFU13–1 (Invitrogen) and 5′-IRD800-labeled CARR-1 (Aloka) or 5′-IRD800-labeled ORFU13–1 and 5′-biotin-labeled CARR-1. Approximately 100 fmol of the labeled PCR products was purified using a MicroSpin S-400 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove excess primers and then were bonded to 60 μl of Streptavidin MagneSphere Paramagnetic Particles (Promega). The magnetic particles were washed with 60 μl of BW buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 2 m NaCl) and suspended in 100 μl of RM buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol). After the addition of 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, or 3.2 μg of the purified C-ht-CarRJ3, the mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then for 45 s at room temperature with 3 units of DNase I (Takara Bio). An equal volume of stop solution (4 m NaCl and 0.1 m EDTA) was immediately added to the reaction mixture to inactivate the DNase. The magnetic particles in the reaction mixture were collected, washed with equal volumes of BW buffer and TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA), and then suspended in 2 μl of H2O and 1 μl of IR2 stop solution (Li-Cor). After incubation of the magnetic particle solution at 95 °C for 2 min, an aliquot of the supernatant was subjected to electrophoresis on a Li-Cor model 4200L-2 auto-DNA sequencer (Li-Cor) together with the sequence ladder obtained using the same 5′-IRD800-labeled primer. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using a DIG Gel Shift Kit 2nd generation (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions as described by Endoh et al. (20Endoh T. Habe H. Nojiri H. Yamane H. Omori T. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A 102-bp probe from –79 to +23 relative to the transcription start point of ORFU13 was obtained by PCR from pBJ3101 with the primer sets F1 and R1, followed by 3′-end labeling of the PCR products with digoxigenin-11-ddUTP. Four 21-bp DNA fragments, Pa (–55 to –35), Pb (–42 to –22), Pc (–24 to –4), and Pd (–11 to +10) were obtained by annealing equimolar concentrations of complementary synthetic oligonucleotides, F-Pa and R-Pa, F-Pb and R-Pb, F-Pc and R-Pc, and F-Pd and R-Pd, respectively (supplemental Table S2). The DNA-protein binding reaction was performed with 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% (w/v) Tween 20, and 30 mm KCl) containing 8 fmol of the digoxigenin-11-ddUTP-labeled probe and 0.1 μg of nonspecific competitor poly[d(A-T)]. When appropriate, 0.8, 8, or 80 pmol of unlabeled specific competitor was added. An increasing amount (from 50 to 400 ng) of the purified C-ht-CarRJ3 was mixed to samples and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, before the addition of 2.5 μl of loading buffer (60% of 0.25× TBE buffer (22.25 mm Tris, 22.25 mm boric acid, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), 40% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue (v/v)). The sample was fractionated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, the labeled DNAs were electroblotted onto Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences) nylon membranes and detected using the CSPD detection system (Roche Applied Science) with LAS-1000 plus (Fujifilm). Transcriptional Unit of the carCA10 Operon—The carbazole catabolic carCA10 gene cluster of P. resinovorans CA10 is composed of ten structural genes and four unknown ORFs arranged in the same direction (Fig. 1B). The anthranilate-inducible promoter Pant under the control of AntR is located upstream of ORF9. To investigate whether the transcript driven from Pant extended up to carE, reverse transcription-PCR was performed. Total RNA was prepared from CA10 cells induced in the presence or absence of carbazole and reverse-transcribed from the CARE-12R primer to yield cDNA. The same amount of cDNA was amplified by PCR to give DNA fragments from ORF9 to carE. As shown in Fig. 2, amplification was observed from all the tested regions, and the levels of mRNA were significantly higher when cells were induced in the presence of carbazole. The level of 16S rRNA was apparently the same regardless of induction (Fig. 2, lane 8). No amplification was detected without reverse transcription (data not shown). This result shows that the ∼12-kb carCA10 gene cluster constitutes an operon, which is transcribed from the Pant promoter. Transcriptional Pattern of the carCA10 Operon—The transcription start point of the Pant promoter is located at 1865 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the carAaCA10 translation start point. Reporter plasmid pMC2065 carries a transcriptional fusion of the 2065-bp fragment just upstream of carAaCA10 (Fig. 1B), which contains the 200-bp region sufficient for the stimulation of Pant in the presence of anthranilate (10Urata M. Miyakoshi M. Kai S. Maeda K. Habe H. Omori T. Yamane H. Nojiri H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6815-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Luciferase expression of pMC2065 was increased with time in the presence of carbazole in CA10 cells, but low level expression was also detected in the absence of carbazole (Fig. 3A). This result is consistent with the previous work, which showed by Northern hybridization that the transcription of the carAa gene is constitutive but is largely induced when CA10 grows on carbazole or anthranilate (10Urata M. Miyakoshi M. Kai S. Maeda K. Habe H. Omori T. Yamane H. Nojiri H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6815-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, luciferase expression of pMC1094, which carries a transcriptional fusion of a 1094-bp fragment truncating the putative transposed region within ORF9 from pMC2065 (Fig. 1B), was constitutive at the same level as the basal expression by pMC2065 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that another promoter for the constitutive transcription of the carCA10 operon is located within the 1094-bp region upstream of carAaCA10, whereas the Pant promoter is required for the inducible transcription of carAaCA10. Characterization of the Constitutive Promoter of the carCA10 Operon—To identify the transcription start point of the constitutive mRNA of carAaCA10, primer extension was performed. Extension products were detected from the templates prepared from CA10 cells both in the presence and absence of carbazole (Fig. 4A). The position of the extension products corresponded to a cytosine base 385-nt upstream of the carAaCA10 translation start point (Fig. 4B). Putative –35 and –10 promoter sequences (5′-TGGAAA-N17-CATCAT-3′) preceded the transcription start point at a 5-nt distance, as is typical among Pseudomonas σ70-dependent promoters (21Domínguez-Cuevas P. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. Pseudomonas: Virulence and Gene Regulation. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York, NY2004: 319-343Crossref Google Scholar). This resul"

NFκB is induced upon stimulation of cellular receptors coupled to different intracellular signaling molecules. Further downstream, TRAF6 links at least two receptor pathways to take control of IκB, the administrator of NFκB activity. Here we report on a strong NFκB activation by Tio, a unique herpesviral oncoprotein promoting transformation of human T cells in a Src-kinase-dependent manner. NFκB induction by Tio is independent of Src-kinase interaction and tyrosine phosphorylation of Tio. Mutation of a glutamic acid-rich motif at the N terminus of Tio, corresponding to a TRAF6 consensus binding motif, completely abrogated NFκB activation. Cotransfection of a dominant negative TRAF6 construct led to a decrease in NFκB activation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that TRAF6 directly binds to the Tio oncoprotein.

NFκB plays an important role in oncogenesis by promoting genes that have an influence on cell proliferation, cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis. It also triggers both innate and adaptive immune responses by transcriptional activation of genes coding for cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules (1Ghosh S. Karin M.

Three classical signaling pathways leading to the activation of NFκB are initiated by the stimulation of different receptors.

The induction of NFκB by the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor family is a prominent event after stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines or recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (13Tsan M.F.

The signal derived from the prototypic Toll-like receptor-4 is dependent on a module containing myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1). The ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 links this module to a trimolecular complex consisting of transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), TAK1-binding protein-1 (TAB1), and TAB2 leading to modification of the IKK complex (14Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 15Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).The critical step common to these major NFκB-inducing pathways is the activation of the IKK complex. This complex consists of two catalytic subunits, IKK-α (IKK1) and IKK-β (IKK2), and the regulatory subunit IKK-γ (NEMO), which is devoid of kinase activity. In the absence of IKK activity, cytoplasmic IκB binds NFκB and thereby prevents nuclear translocation of this transcription factor. The activated IKK complex phosphorylates IκB, which in turn gets ubiquitinated, dissociates from the NFκB complex, and is degraded by the proteasome. Free NFκB then enters the nucleus and activates transcription (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109 (suppl.): S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar, 4Li Q.

Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar).Induction of the transcription factor NFκB is also considered to be important for transformation and immortalization of lymphoid cells by human T cell leukemia virus type-1 or Epstein-Barr virus (2Greten F.R. Karin M. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 17Akagi T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grassmann R. Berchtold S.

A. 1993; 90: 9150-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In this context, activation of NFκB is attributed to the viral oncoproteins, the 40-kDa transactivator protein of the pX region (Tax) of human T cell leukemia virus type-1, and the latent membrane protein (LMP-1) of Epstein-Barr virus, respectively (20Laherty C.D.

Nature. 1988; 333: 776-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). According to the most widely accepted concept, Tax deregulates the IKK complex by linking the scaffold protein IKK-γ to the upstream kinases MEKK1 and NIK, which in turn phosphorylate IKK-α and IKK-β. In addition, Tax supports the oligomerization of IKK-γ to enhance the activity of the IKK complex (22Jeang K.T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). LMP-1 induces NFκB activity 20-40-fold (19Kaye K.M. Izumi K.M. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9150-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 23Gires O. Zimber-Strobl U. Gonnella R. Ueffing M. Marschall G. Zeidler R. Pich D. Hammerschmidt W.

The signal is transduced by a TNFR-like pathway, where TRADD and TRAF2, which directly interact with LMP-1, are essential (25Kaye K.M. Devergne O. Harada J.N. Izumi K.M. Yalamanchili R. Kieff E.

Biol. 1996; 16: 7098-7108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAF6 also affects NFκB activation by LMP-1 through its action downstream of TRADD and TRAF2 (28Schultheiss U. Puschner S. Kremmer E. Mak T.W. Engelmann H. Hammerschmidt W. Kieser A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5678-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Luftig M. Prinarakis E. Yasui T. Tsichritzis T. Cahir-McFarland E. Inoue J.

An interaction of TRAF6 with TRADD or TRAF2 has not been described for TNFR signaling so far. Thus, Tax activates NFκB by direct modification of the IKK complex, whereas LMP-1 mimics a constitutively active receptor.Herpesvirus saimiri and Herpesvirus ateles are members of the γ2-herpesviruses or rhadinoviruses. Both induce malignant lymphoproliferation in New World monkeys, except for their natural hosts, the squirrel monkey and the spider monkey, respectively (30Falk L. Wright J. Wolfe L. Deinhardt F. Int.

Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, H. saimiri strain C488 is able to transform human T lymphocytes to permanent growth in culture (34Biesinger B. Muller-Fleckenstein I. Simmer B. Lang G. Wittmann S. Platzer E. Desrosiers R.C. Fleckenstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3116-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The saimiri transformation-associated protein of subgroup C (StpC) and the tyrosine kinase-interacting protein (Tip) are the two oncoproteins essential for the T cell-transforming phenotype of strain C488 (35Duboise S.M. Guo J. Czajak S. Desrosiers R.C. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wehner L.E. Schroder N. Kamino K. Friedrich U. Biesinger B. Ruther U.

Virology. 1993; 196: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, the related H. ateles encodes only one oncoprotein, the “two-in-one” (Tio) protein. Tio is a membrane-bound protein, forming homodimers or multimers, which exhibits sequence homologies to both StpC and Tip (38Albrecht J.C. Friedrich U. Kardinal C. Koehn J. Fleckenstein B. Feller S.M. Biesinger B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4631-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant H. saimiri carrying tio in place of stpC and tip demonstrated that Tio can substitute for StpC and Tip in T cell transformation (39Albrecht J.C. Biesinger B. Muller-Fleckenstein I. Lengenfelder D. Schmidt M. Fleckenstein B. Ensser A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9814-9819Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In previous studies, different analogous functions for Tip and Tio have been reported. They both interact with cellular Src family kinases by binding to their Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (38Albrecht J.C. Friedrich U. Kardinal C. Koehn J. Fleckenstein B. Feller S.M. Biesinger B. J.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14932-14939Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The sole phosphorylation site of Tio, tyrosine residue 136, is essential for the immortalization of primary human T cells (42Albrecht J.C. Muller-Fleckenstein I. Schmidt M. Fleckenstein B. Biesinger B. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10507-10513Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A function of Tio related to StpC could not be demonstrated so far. StpC raises the transcriptional activity of NFκB 3.5-6-fold. A TRAF2 binding site in the N-terminal region of StpC is essential, not only for TRAF2 binding, but also for NFκB induction and transformation of primary human T lymphocytes (46Lee H. Choi J.K. Li M. Kaye K. Kieff E. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3913-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this report, we describe a novel mode of constitutive NFκB activation by demonstrating a direct interaction between the viral oncoprotein Tio and TRAF6, a key modification enzyme and adapter molecule of multiple NFκB-inducing signaling cascades.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Expression Plasmids—Cultures of transformed human cord blood lymphocytes (CBL-Tio; CBL-M124) were generated as described previously (39Albrecht J.C. Biesinger B. Muller-Fleckenstein I. Lengenfelder D. Schmidt M. Fleckenstein B. Ensser A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9814-9819Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Long term cultures and Jurkat T cells (E6.1; American Type Culture Collection, TIB-152) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), glutamine, and antibiotics. For transfection purposes, Jurkat T cells were cultivated at a maximum concentration of 106 cells/ml.All mutant Tio plasmids derived from the previously described FLAG-Tio (wild-type Tio, YYYY) construct (38Albrecht J.C. Friedrich U. Kardinal C. Koehn J. Fleckenstein B. Feller S.M. Biesinger B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4631-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion mutants were created by PCR amplification with oligonucleotide primers introducing an NheI recognition sequence, which translates into alanine and serine residues at the deletion site. Mutant D1 was created using primers SH9 (5′-GTTCGCTAGCCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTG-3′) and SH10 (5′-GGTCGCTAGCCCGCTGGGCGACTCTGG-3′); mutant D2 with primers SH9 and SH11 (5′-AGCCGCTAGCAACATCCCTCAGGACCCGA-3′); mutant D4 with primers SH14 (5′-CGGTGCTAGCTTCTTCGTGTTCTTGTGGC-3′) and SH15 (5′-CCACGCTA GCGGTGAAGAAGGGCCACC-3′); mutant D6 with primers SH9 and SH12 (5′-CCATGCTAGCAATTCTAAAAATGAAGATTACC-3′); mutant D7 with primers SH12 and SH16 (5′-CTTCGCTAGCGATGTTAGGTGGCCCTTC-3′); mutant D8 with primers SH12 and SH14 (see Fig. 2). Tio point mutants were created by PCR according to the QuikChange® protocol (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Mutant P1 was created using primers SH17 (5′-GACAAGATGGCTAACCAGCCACAACAACACCAACAAGGAAAACCCTTCTTC-3′) and SH18 (5′-GAAGAAGGGTTTTCCTTGTTGGTGTTGTTGTGGCTGGTTAGCCATCTTGTC-3′) to replace Glu-7, Glu-9, and Glu-10 by Gln; mutant P2 using SH19 (5′-GCTGGGCGACTCTGGTCAACAAGGGCCACCTAACATCCCTCAG-3′) and SH20 (5′-CTGAGGGATGTTAGGTGGCCCTTGTTGACCAGAGTCGCCCAGC-3′) to replace Glu-23 and Glu-24 by Gln; mutant P3 using SH21 (5′-GACAAGATGGCTAACGGGCCACAAGGACACGGAGGAGGAAAACCCTTCTTC-3′) and SH22 (5′-GAAGAAGGGTTTTCCTCCTCCGTGTCCTTGTGGCCCGTTAGCCATCTTGTC-3′) to replace Glu-7, Glu-9, and Glu-10 by Gly; mutant P4 using SH23 (5′-GCTGGGCGACTCTGGTGGAGGAGGGCCACCTAACATCCCTCAG-3′) and SH24 (5′-CTGAGGGATGTTAGGTGGCCCTCCTCCACCAGAGTCGCCCAGC-3′) to replace Glu-23 and Glu24 by Gly; mutant P5 using SH17, SH18, SH19, and SH20 to replace Glu-7, Glu-9, and Glu-10 by Gln plus Glu-23 and Glu-24 by Gln; mutant P7 using SH21, SH22, SH23, and SH24 to replace Glu-7, Glu-9, and Glu-10 by Gly plus Glu-23 and Glu-24 by Gly. The mutant PAPA was created using primers PAPA-1 (5′-GAAAACCCTTCTTCGCCGGCGTGGGCGACT-3′) and PAPA-2 (5′-AGTCGCCCACGCCGGCGAAGAAGGGTTTTC-3′) to change Pro-16 and Pro-17 to Ala, Tio mutant PAQK was created using PAQK-A (5′-GGCCACCTAACATCGCTAAGGACCCGACGCCAGG-3′) and PAQK-B (5′-CCTGGCGTCGGGTCCTTAGCGATGTTAGGTGGCC-3′) to change Pro-30 to Ala and Gln-31 to Lys; PAPALK was created using LK-A (5′-CCTTCTTCGCCGC GAAGGGCGACTCTGGTG-3′) and LK-B (5′-CACCAGAGTCGCCCTTCGCGGCGAAGAAGG-3′) to substitute Leu-18 for Lys within the PAPA mutant. The resulting nucleotide sequences were confirmed by automated sequence analysis on an ABI3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Tio mutants FYFF, YFYY, and PARG were described previously (42Albrecht J.C. Muller-Fleckenstein I. Schmidt M. Fleckenstein B. Biesinger B. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10507-10513Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for dominant negative IκBα (IκBα DN) and constitutively active IKK2 (IKK2 EE) were kindly provided by R.

A plasmid expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), pEGFP-C2, (BD Biosciences) was used to verify transfection efficiency.Cell Lysis, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Jurkat T cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml of each aprotinin and leupeptin (Sigma). Lysates were cleared at 13,000 revolutions/min for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were separated by denaturating SDS-PAGE. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (Amersham Biosciences) were used for immunoblotting and incubated with antisera against Tio (38Albrecht J.C. Friedrich U. Kardinal C. Koehn J.

For detection of primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, either against mouse (F(ab)2; Amersham Biosciences; diluted 1/5000) or rabbit (Dako, Hamburg, Germany; diluted 1/20000) immunoglobulins were used. Immunodetection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, 500 μl of cleared lysates (800-1300 μg of protein) were mixed with antisera against TRAF6, TRAF2 (2 μg of each), or Tio (2 μl) and rotated at 4 °C overnight. The next day, 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sepharose CL-4B; Amersham Biosciences) were added for 1 h at 4°C. FLAG-tagged proteins were incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min in 20 μl of SDS-loading buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE.Transfection—Ten million Jurkat T cells per sample were electroporated with 25-100 μg of DNA. Vector plasmid (pcDNA3) was used to equalize promoter copy numbers in all transfections. Electroporation was carried out with an Easyject Plus apparatus (Equibio, Boughton, UK) at 250 V, 1500 microfarads. The cells were transfected in complete medium without antibiotics, harvested 48 h post-transfection and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Two-thirds of the cells were used for Western blot analysis, and one-third was used for luciferase reporter assays.Reporter Plasmids and Assays—The reporter construct pNFκB-Luc contains five NFκB binding sites in front of a luciferase gene (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Experimental integrity was confirmed with alternative NFκB reporter constructs, pBIIxLuc with four NFκB binding sites (49Saksela K. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

Cell pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-H3PO4, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DCTA (trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid monohydrate; Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 revolutions/min. Assay buffer (100 μl; 100 mm K3PO4, 15 mm MgSO4, 5 mm ATP) was mixed with lysates (25 or 50 μl) in a 96-well plate. Assay buffer (100 μl) supplemented with d-luciferin (1 mm) (Roche Applied Science) was added, and luciferase activity was determined with a luminometer (Orion, Berthold, Germany). Relative luciferase activity was calculated by dividing the sample values by the value of vector DNA (pcDNA3) cotransfected with the reporter construct.Drug Treatment of Transfected Cells—Transfected Jurkat T cells were dispensed into 12 wells 24 h post-electroporation and treated for 24 h with PMA (Sigma), ionomycin (Sigma), PKC inhibitors Gö6983 (51Gschwendt M.

https://openalex.org/W2095386538,"The CCA-adding enzyme adds CCA to the 3′-end of tRNA one nucleotide at a time, using CTP and ATP as substrates. We found previously that tRNA does not rotate or translocate on the enzyme during the addition of C75 and A76. We therefore predicted that the growing 3′-end of tRNA must, upon addition of each nucleotide, refold to reposition the new 3′-hydroxyl equivalently relative to the solitary nucleotidyltransferase motif. Cocrystal structures of the class I archaeal Archaeoglobus fulgidus enzyme, poised for addition of C75 and A76, confirmed this prediction. We have also demonstrated that an evolutionarily flexible β-turn facilitates progressive refolding of the 3′-terminal C74 and C75 residues during C75 and A76 addition. Although useful cocrystals corresponding to C74 addition have not yet been obtained, we now show experimentally that tRNA does not rotate or translocate during C74 addition. We therefore propose, based on the existing A. fulgidus cocrystal structures, that the same flexible β-turn functions as a wedge between the discriminator base (N73) and the terminal base pair of the acceptor stem, unstacking and repositioning N73 to attack the incoming CTP. Thus a single flexible β-turn would orchestrate consecutive addition of all three nucleotides without significant movement of the tRNA on the enzyme surface. The CCA-adding enzyme adds CCA to the 3′-end of tRNA one nucleotide at a time, using CTP and ATP as substrates. We found previously that tRNA does not rotate or translocate on the enzyme during the addition of C75 and A76. We therefore predicted that the growing 3′-end of tRNA must, upon addition of each nucleotide, refold to reposition the new 3′-hydroxyl equivalently relative to the solitary nucleotidyltransferase motif. Cocrystal structures of the class I archaeal Archaeoglobus fulgidus enzyme, poised for addition of C75 and A76, confirmed this prediction. We have also demonstrated that an evolutionarily flexible β-turn facilitates progressive refolding of the 3′-terminal C74 and C75 residues during C75 and A76 addition. Although useful cocrystals corresponding to C74 addition have not yet been obtained, we now show experimentally that tRNA does not rotate or translocate during C74 addition. We therefore propose, based on the existing A. fulgidus cocrystal structures, that the same flexible β-turn functions as a wedge between the discriminator base (N73) and the terminal base pair of the acceptor stem, unstacking and repositioning N73 to attack the incoming CTP. Thus a single flexible β-turn would orchestrate consecutive addition of all three nucleotides without significant movement of the tRNA on the enzyme surface. CCA-adding enzymes (ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferases) catalyze the addition and regeneration of the 3′-terminal CCA sequence of tRNA (1Deutscher M.P. Enzymes. 1982; 15: 183-215Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The activity is found in all three kingdoms of life (2Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential for viability (3Aebi M. Kirchner G. Chen J.Y. Vijayraghavan U. Jacobson A. Martin N.C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16216-16220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in those organisms, including all eukaryotes, many Archaea, and some eubacteria, where some or all of the tRNA genes do not encode the 3′-terminal CCA sequence. In organisms where all tRNA genes encode CCA, CCA-adding activity repairs the CCA terminus, and loss of activity impairs cell growth (4Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2473-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Curiously, in some eubacteria, CCA-adding activity is the shared responsibility of closely related CC- and A-adding enzymes, which are themselves highly homologous to the CCA-adding enzymes of other eubacteria (5Tomita K. Fukai S. Ishitani R. Ueda T. Takeuchi N. Vassylyev D.G. Nureki O. Nature. 2004; 430: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All CCA-adding enzymes belong to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (6Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which can be divided into two classes based on sequence similarities (2Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). Class I nucleotidyltransferases include archaeal CCA-adding enzymes, as well as eukaryotic DNA polymerase β, poly(A) polymerase, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and eubacterial kanamycin and streptomycin nucleotidyltransferases. Class II nucleotidyltransferases include both eubacterial and eukaryotic CCA-adding enzymes, as well as eubacterial poly(A) polymerase. As expected, the nucleotidyltransferase domains of both classes are structurally homologous, but elsewhere the structures diverge completely; class I structures are compact and rich in β-sheet (7Xiong Y. Li F. Wang J. Weiner A.M. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1165-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Okabe M. Tomita K. Ishitani R. Ishii R. Takeuchi N. Arisaka F. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5918-5927Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas class II structures are extended, rich in α-helix, and devoid of β-sheet except in the nucleotidyltransferase domain (9Li F. Xiong Y. Wang J. Cho H.D. Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Augustin M.A. Reichert A.S. Betat H. Huber R. Morl M. Steegborn C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus the two classes may have evolved independently from an ancestral nucleotidyltransferase core. Unlike all other sequence-specific RNA and DNA polymerases, the CCA-adding enzyme does not use a nucleic acid template (2Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of biochemical experiments demonstrating that tRNA does not translocate or rotate along the CCA-adding enzyme during addition of C75 and A76, we proposed a “collaborative templating” model (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The growing 3′-end of tRNA and the active site of the enzyme would work together to refold the 3′-end after each step and to reposition the new 3′-hydroxyl for attack on the next incoming nucleotide. The emerging crystal structures confirmed this proposal. Cocrystal structures of the eubacterial Bacillus stearothermophilus enzyme in complex with CTP and ATP revealed that class II enzymes use a pure protein template, which recognizes both CTP and ATP (9Li F. Xiong Y. Wang J. Cho H.D. Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), although it is not yet clear how the addition of C75 switches the nucleotide binding specificity from CTP to ATP. A cocrystal structure for the class II eubacterial Aquifex aeolicus A-adding enzyme in complex with tRNA-NCC substrate and an ATP analog (5Tomita K. Fukai S. Ishitani R. Ueda T. Takeuchi N. Vassylyev D.G. Nureki O. Nature. 2004; 430: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although tantalizing, did not clarify this question. Cocrystal structures of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus enzyme with oligonucleotide mimics of two different tRNA substrates (tRNA-NC + CTP and tRNA-NCC + ATP) as well as with mature tRNA-NCCA demonstrated that class I enzymes use a true ribonucleoprotein template. The growing 3′-end of tRNA works together with the active site to specify the incoming nucleotide, accommodate the growing 3′-end, and position the new 3′-hydroxyl for attack on the incoming nucleotide (12Xiong Y. Steitz T.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Strict use of a ribonucleoprotein template explains why the Archaeoglobus enzyme does not bind nucleotides specifically in the absence of tRNA substrate (7Xiong Y. Li F. Wang J. Weiner A.M. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1165-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Okabe M. Tomita K. Ishitani R. Ishii R. Takeuchi N. Arisaka F. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5918-5927Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Archaeoglobus structures also revealed the key role of a highly conserved β-turn in accommodating and positioning the growing 3′-end of the tRNA during C75 and A76 addition (12Xiong Y. Steitz T.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as was subsequently confirmed by mutational analysis (13Cho H.D. Verlinde C.L. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9555-9566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cocrystals corresponding to C74 addition have remained elusive, however, and insufficient information was available to model this step in the reaction pathway. We have now used an ethylnitrosourea (ENU) 2The abbreviations used are: ENU, ethylnitrosourea; tRNA-NCCA, mature tRNA where N is the discriminator base. interference protocol (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and synthetic tRNA-like minihelices (14Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cho H.D. Tomita K. Suzuki T. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3447-3455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Cho H.D. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40130-40136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), to ask whether tRNA translocates or rotates on the enzyme following C74 addition. To ensure the generality of our results, we tested the archaeal class I enzymes from A. fulgidus and Sulfolobus shibatae and the eubacterial class II enzyme from B. stearothermophilus. We had previously demonstrated that tRNA does not rotate or translocate during C75 and A76 addition (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); our new data allows us to conclude that tRNA remains fixed on the enzyme through all three steps of CCA addition. Moreover, these new data, in combination with the C75 addition structure for the Archaeoglobus enzyme (12Xiong Y. Steitz T.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and our mutational analysis of the S. shibatae β-turn (13Cho H.D. Verlinde C.L. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9555-9566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), enabled us to model C74 addition by the Archaeoglobus enzyme. We propose that the highly conserved β-turn adopts four consecutive conformations, the first of which functions as a wedge to disrupt stacking of the discriminator base on the terminal base pair of the acceptor stem, driving the 3′-hydroxyl of the ribose upwards toward the incoming CTP. CCA-adding Enzyme Expression and Assay—Hexahistidine-tagged A. fulgidus, S. shibatae, and B. stearothermophilus CCA-adding enzymes were prepared by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), dialyzed into buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and stored at -70 °C in buffer B containing 50% glycerol (16Cho H.D. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40130-40136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17Cho H.D. Oyelere A.K. Strobel S.A. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The two tRNAIle minihelices, tRNAIle-N32 and tRNAIle-NC33, were based on Mycoplasma pneumoniae tRNA (see Fig. 1A). Crude hairpin minihelices (Dharmacon) were purified by denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, visualized by UV light shadowing, carefully excised to exclude aberrant products, and renatured by heating to 80 °C followed by snap cooling. As shown Fig. 1A, the minihelix sequences are tRNAIle-N32, 5′-GGAAGUAGAUGGUUCAAGUCCAUUUACUUCCA-3′, and tRNAIle-NC33, 5′-GGAAGUAGAUGGUUCAAGUCCAUUUACUUCCAC-3′. The 10-μl CCA addition assays contained 100 mm glycine/NaOH (pH 9.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm CTP, 50 μm ATP, 2 μm tRNA minihelix, 100 nm [α-32P]CTP or [α-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and 10 nm purified protein at 60 °C (A. fulgidus), 70 °C (S. shibatae), or 55 °C (B. stearothermophilus) for 5 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 95% deionized formamide containing 20 mm sodium EDTA (pH 8.0), xylene cyanol (0.2%), and bromphenol blue (0.2%). Products were resolved by 12% denaturing PAGE and quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Ethylnitrosourea Interference Assay—Alkylation of backbone phosphates by ENU was done as described (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18Romby P. Moras D. Bergdoll M. Dumas P. Vlassov V.V. Westhof E. Ebel J.P. Giege R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μg of unlabeled tRNAIle-N32 and tRNAIle-NC33 were alkylated by incubation for 3 h at room temperature in 20 μl containing 300 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 20% v/v of a saturated solution of ENU (Sigma) in ethanol. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and ethanol precipitated with glycogen carrier (Roche Applied Science). Following three consecutive ethanol precipitations to remove all traces of ENU, aliquots of the alkylated tRNA minihelices (1 μg) were incubated with A. fulgidus, S. shibatae, and B. stearothermophilus CCA-adding enzymes (5, 15, 30 ng) in 15-μl addition reactions containing 1 μm [α-32P]CTP. The assays were stopped after 5 min by addition of 10 μl of RNA loading buffer. The 3′-end-labeled tRNA-NC* and tRNA-NCC* were purified by denaturing 15% PAGE, eluted, and ethanol-precipitated. Alkylated tRNAs were taken up in 10 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and phosphotriester bonds were cleaved by incubation at 50 °C for 5 min. In a control reaction to map alkylation sites on free tRNA-N and tRNA-NC, tRNA substrates were first 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]CTP, purified by 15% PAGE, then treated with ENU, cleaved in alkali, and resolved by 20% PAGE. Markers were generated by partial digestion with RNase T1 (Ambion), which specifically cleaves single-stranded RNA after G residues producing 3′-phosphorylated ends (19Knapp G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We previously performed ethylation protection and interference experiments using ENU to identify tRNA backbone phosphates that are critical for addition of C75 and A76 to tRNA-NC and tRNA-NCC, respectively (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These experiments established that tRNA does not rotate or translocate on the surface of the CCA-adding enzyme during C75 and A76 addition; however, we were unable to examine C74 addition because short tRNA cleavage fragments corresponding to phosphates nearest the labeled 3′-end were very inefficiently recovered (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18Romby P. Moras D. Bergdoll M. Dumas P. Vlassov V.V. Westhof E. Ebel J.P. Giege R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, we have now used A+U-rich tRNA minihelices as substrates (Fig. 1A), which compensate for the low yield of short cleavage fragments by providing improved resolution during the gel electrophoresis step. CCA-adding enzymes recognize universally conserved features of tRNA located primarily in the top half of the molecule (7Xiong Y. Li F. Wang J. Weiner A.M. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1165-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar), and tDNA minihelices corresponding to the top half of Escherichia coli tRNAval are good substrates for CCA addition in regard to catalytic efficiency and specificity (14Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cho H.D. Tomita K. Suzuki T. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3447-3455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Cho H.D. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40130-40136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We designed two minihelix substrates corresponding to the top half of the A+U-rich M. pneumoniae tRNAIle: tRNAIle-N32, and tRNAIle-NC33, lacking 3′-terminal CCA and CA, respectively (Fig. 1A). The hairpin minihelices were purified by denaturing 15% PAGE to remove any aberrant synthetic products and were renatured by snap cooling. As expected, both minihelices were good substrates for the class I archaeal CCA-adding enzymes from A. fulgidus and S. shibatae, as well as for the class II enzyme from B. stearothermophilus (Fig. 1B) with the reaction in the linear range (Fig. 1C). To determine whether tRNA translocates or rotates after C74 addition, we used ENU interference to identify tRNA backbone phosphates, which are critical for addition of 3′-terminal C74; addition of C75, which we had assayed previously (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), served as the control (Fig. 2). The tRNAIle-N32 and tRNAIle-NC33 minihelix substrates were first alkylated with ENU, then incubated with the Archaeoglobus, Sulfolobus, or Bacillus enzymes under standard assay conditions in the presence of 1 μm [α-32P]CTP (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As additional controls, tRNAIle-N32 and tRNAIle-NC33 were 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]CTP before alkylation with ENU. The essential phosphates were identified as bands that were absent or greatly reduced when alkylation preceded end-labeling. Lest high levels of enzyme activity obscure the effects of alkylation, ENU treatment was carried out at several enzyme concentrations (5, 15, and 30 ng/15 μl) (Fig. 1C). We identified 14 phosphates in the tRNAIle-N32 substrate that are essential for C74 addition by the class I Archaeoglobus and Sulfolobus enzymes (Fig. 2, A and B, left panels): phosphates 6 (minihelix 6), 48-52 (minihelix 7-11), 61-65 (minihelix 20-24), and 67-69 (minihelix 26-28). A very similar phosphate interference pattern, except for phosphates 53 (minihelix 12) and 66 (minihelix 25), was observed for C75 addition to tRNAIle-NC33 by these enzymes (Fig. 2, A and B, right panels). Although the alkylation interference patterns differ in detail between the intact B. subtilis tRNAAsp substrate used previously (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the M. pneumoniae minihelix substrates used here (Fig. 2), the new data agree with our previous observation that all alkylated phosphates that interfere with activity are located within the top half of tRNA. Intriguingly, the efficiency of C74 and C75 addition was dramatically enhanced by alkylation of minihelix phosphate 14 within the T-loop of the M. pneumoniae tRNAIle minihelix (Fig. 2, arrowheads), whereas alkylation of phosphate 55 (equivalent to minihelix phosphate 14) inhibited C75 and A76 addition when full-length B. subtilis tRNAAsp was used as substrate (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We can only speculate based on the available cocrystal structures (12Xiong Y. Steitz T.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but elimination of unfavorable negative charge by alkylation may enhance minihelix binding, perhaps because the T-loop is unable to fold correctly in the absence of a companion D-loop (but see Ref. 20Hoang C. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), whereas alkylation of phosphate 55 in full-length tRNA would prevent interaction with R344 and R361 (discussed below; also see Fig. 6). Consistent with these explanations, binding of full-length tRNA to the enzyme protects phosphate 55 from ENU alkylation, and alkylation of phosphates 48 and 49, which are located where the base of the T-stem interacts with the adjacent variable loop, enhances the reaction in intact B. subtilis tRNAAsp (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The phosphate interference patterns observed for C74 and C75 addition by the class II Bacillus enzyme were nearly identical (Figs. 2C and 3), indicating that tRNA does not rotate or translocate between C74 and C75 addition. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4, the phosphate interference patterns observed for C74 and C75 addition by class I and class II enzymes are also nearly identical (compare Fig. 2, A-C) except for phosphates 53 and 54 (minihelix phosphates 12 and 13). This remarkable observation is consistent with evidence that tRNA/protein interactions are nearly identical for class I and class II enzymes (5Tomita K. Fukai S. Ishitani R. Ueda T. Takeuchi N.

Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and almost every essential phosphate identified by alkylation interference is in direct contact with the enzyme (Fig. 4) as seen in the cocrystal structures of both the class I A. fulgidus CCA-adding enzyme (12Xiong Y. Steitz T.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A) and the class II A. aeolicus A-adding enzyme (5Tomita K. Fukai S. Ishitani R. Ueda T. Takeuchi N. Vassylyev D.G. Nureki O. Nature. 2004; 430: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Loss of activity caused by alkylation of the variable loop (phosphates 49 and 50) may reflect a structural alteration caused by alkylation of the tRNA backbone, rather than direct interference of these alkylated phosphates with activity (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). None of the interference data appear to be explained by tRNA interactions with the other subunit of the enzyme dimer (not shown in Fig. 4), although the T- and D-loops of the bound tRNA may interact with α-helix H and β-strand 8 of the nonbinding monomer (Arg-197 is 5.6Å from O-4 of U17) (8Okabe M. Tomita K. Ishitani R. Ishii R. Takeuchi N. Arisaka F. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5918-5927Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Admittedly, the phosphate alkylations in the C74 and C75 minihelix T-loops which interfere with B. stearothermophilus activity are shifted by one nucleotide (Fig. 3), but it would be premature to interpret this because we do not know whether the solitary T-loop is “preorganized” and can fold independently of the D-loop (20Hoang C. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar); the shift could mean that the minihelices rotate and/or translocate very subtly, or (as discussed below) minihelices lacking a companion D-loop may tend to slip toward the tail domain. Taken together with previous evidence that tRNA does not rotate or translocate during C75 and A76 addition (11Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we conclude that the tRNA minihelix remains fixed on the surface of the enzyme throughout CCA addition. To better understand how the tRNA substrate can remain bound without rotation or translocation during the three consecutive steps of CCA addition, we examined the interactions between tRNA and the class I A. fulgidus enzyme (Fig. 5). The A. fulgidus enzyme is a dimer that can bind two tRNAs (12Xiong Y. Steitz T.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); however, tRNA binding does not appear to be cooperative 3H.-D. Cho, unpublished data. and other highly homologous archaeal CCA-adding enzymes appear to bind only a single tRNA (13Cho H.D. Verlinde C.L. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9555-9566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Li F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 4J. Kwak, H.-D. Cho, and A. M. Weiner, unpublished data. These data suggest that the dimeric enzyme normally binds only a single tRNA in vivo. The enzyme monomer unit can be divided into head, neck, body, and tail domains; the head contains the nucleotidyltransferase active site, the nucleotide binding site, and the flexible β-turn that progressively refolds to accommodate the growing 3′-end of the tRNA (12Xiong Y. Steitz T.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Cho H.D. Verlinde C.L. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9555-9566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The 3′-end of the tRNA nestles in the head domain, the acceptor (“top half”) minihelix is nearly aligned with α-helix L of the body domain, and the corner formed by the T- and D-loops fits snugly against the tail domain (Fig. 4A, also see Fig. 6). Sequence alignment of the helix L region from 20 archaeal CCA-adding enzymes representing 5 phylogenetically distinct groups (Fig. 5A) revealed 3 apparently invariant residues (Asp-291, Gln-296, and Arg-299 in the A. fulgidus numbering system), one nearly invariant residue (Pro-295, sometimes Gly, rarely Ala), and a number of distal, more weakly conserved basic or polar residues (Arg-302, Lys-303, and Arg-310 in A. fulgidus). Remarkably, all three invariant residues interact specifically with the tRNA acceptor stem nearest the growing CCA terminus: Asp-291 interacts the 2′-ribose hydroxyl of the discriminator base G73, Gln-296 with the C2 backbone phosphate, and Arg-299 with the G3, G4, and A64 backbone phosphates (Fig. 5B). The Gln-296-G3 phosphate interaction may also be reinforced by interaction of the C2 phosphate with highly conserved Lys-402 (Fig. S1, A. fulgidus numbering) in helix P (Fig. 5C). The more weakly conserved residues in helix L emanate from two or three consecutive turns facing the tRNA minihelix (Fig. 5A, highlighted in yellow) and interact with backbone phosphates further from the growing 3′-end (e.g. Arg-302, Lys-303, and Arg-310 in A. fulgidus; Lys-291, Arg-294, Lys-297 in S. shibatae; Arg-315, Arg-318 in H. halobium; and Lys-214, Lys-218 in P. furiosus). A similar pattern of RNA/protein interactions is seen for minihelix binding, except that the minihelices (at least i"

Unexpectedly, XOR was found to play an essential role in milk secretion in the differentiating mammary gland, where it is an integral component of the milk fat globule. XOR gene expression in both mammary glands and differentiating mammary epithelial cells in culture is regulated by the lactogenic hormones prolactin and cortisol. Expression in mammary epithelial cells is also regulated by inflammatory cytokines and induced by cycloheximide. Cycloheximide was found to stimulate XOR gene expression in differentiating HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells. Activation of XOR gene expression by both cycloheximide and inflammatory cytokines suggested that XOR may be regulated by stress-activated protein kinases, the MAPKs. We demonstrate here that XOR was induced in HC11 cells by low dose cycloheximide and that expression was blocked by inhibitors of p38 MAPK. Accumulation of phospho-p38 was stimulated by low dose cycloheximide. Low dose cycloheximide stress promoted phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) transcription factor, which was blocked by inhibition of p38. Furthermore, C/EBPβ was found to activate the mouse XOR promoter, and XOR promoter-C/EBPβ protein complexes were induced by low dose cycloheximide stress. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that mouse mammary epithelial cell XOR is regulated by p38 MAPK.

Med. 2002; 33: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). XOR contributes to many inflammatory disorders, and it was found to play an essential role in innate immunity as a product of mononuclear phagocytes (3Vorbach C. Harrison R. Capecchi M.R. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 512-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 4Wright R.M. Ginger L.A. Kosila N. Elkins N.D. Essary B. McManaman J.L. Repine J.E. Am. J.

Res. 2004; 95: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, XOR was found to provide a critical function in the maturation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells as a source of uric acid (6Shi Y. Evans J.E. Rock K.L. Nature. 2003; 425: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). XOR is also essential to the biology of the mammary gland. Analysis of XOR knockout mice revealed its indispensable role in lactation (7Vorbach C. Scriven A. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3223-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), where XOR forms a structural component of the membrane-encapsulated milk fat globule (MFG) (8McManaman J.L. Palmer C.A. Wright R.M. Neville M.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 545: 567-579Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). XOR homozygous knockouts (XOR-/-) are unexpectedly lethal in neonatal mice. However, in mice carrying the XOR heterozygous knockout (XOR+/-), lactogenesis fails as a result of disrupted formation of the MFG. The novel dual roles played by XOR as a catalytic enzyme and as a structural component of the MFG provide an example of “gene sharing,” in which XOR catalysis may be dispensable for its role as a structural protein. Regulation of XOR gene expression in the differentiating and lactating mammary gland is largely unknown. In the mouse mammary gland, XOR gene expression and mRNA content are regulated by pregnancy, lactation, and involution (9McManaman J.L. Neville M.C. Wright R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10McManaman J.L. Hanson L. Neville M.C. Wright R.M. Arch. Biochem.

J. 1996; 319: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). XOR is induced in mammary glands early in pregnancy. XOR is further stimulated by lactation and then precipitously lost upon the cessation of lactation (9McManaman J.L. Neville M.C. Wright R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10McManaman J.L. Hanson L. Neville M.C. Wright R.M. Arch. Biochem.

J. 1996; 319: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In cultured HC11 mammary epithelial cells, XOR is induced by the lactogenic hormones prolactin and cortisol (or dexamethasone) (10McManaman J.L. Hanson L. Neville M.C. Wright R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Kurosaki M. Zanotta S. Calzi M.L. Garattini E. Terao M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and these experiments identified some features in the regulation of XOR gene expression. Whereas prolactin induction is blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, expression is stimulated by genistein in cells not treated with hormone. Vanadate, an inhibitor of both phosphatase activity and the glucocorticoid receptor (12Modarress K.J. Cavanaugh A.H. Chakraborti P.K. Simons S.S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 523-538Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), blocks lactogenic hormone-induced XOR expression, as does the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486, suggesting a mode of XOR regulation by lactogenic hormones that is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor in conjunction with prolactin-induced JAK2/STAT5 and tyrosine kinases (14Rosen J.M. Wyszomierski S.L. Hadsell D. Ann. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 407-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). XOR expression is up-regulated in cycloheximide-treated HC11 mammary epithelial cells in the absence of lactogenic hormone induction (11Kurosaki M. Zanotta S. Calzi M.L. Garattini E. Terao M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, XOR expression is activated by the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ in mammary epithelial cells (15Page S. Powell D. Benboubetra M. Stevens C.R. Blake D.R. Selase F. Wolstenholm A.J. Harrison R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1381: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Activation of XOR expression by both cycloheximide and inflammatory cytokines suggests the potential involvement of stress-activated protein kinases, the MAPKs, in the activation of mouse XOR expression (16Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar). We demonstrate, for the first time, a key role in mouse mammary epithelial cell XOR expression for p38 MAPK and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) transcription factor induced by low dose cycloheximide stress. These data demonstrate the dependence of mouse XOR expression in mammary epithelial cells on the C/EBPβ transcription factor and suggest a potentially critical role for p38 MAPK activation of C/EBPβ in mammary epithelial cells. Materials and Reagents—Most reagents, buffers, substrates, PAGE supplies, SB203580, SB202190, U0126, insulin, prolactin, dexamethasone, cycloheximide, and puromycin were purchased from Sigma. The TOPO-II TA cloning vector, TRIzol reagent, and media for cell culture were obtained in powdered form from Invitrogen. Antibodies to p38 family members and C/EBPβ were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-p38 and anti-phospho-C/EBPβ antisera were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen or Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Luciferase fusion plasmids and β-galactosidase expression plasmids were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). O-Nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside, poly(dI·dC), and restriction endonucleases were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Fetal bovine serum was from Gemini Bio-Products (Woodland, CA). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR reagents were from Eppendorf-5 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). Mammary Epithelial Cell Culture and Differentiation—HC11 mammary epithelial cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (pH 7.4), 1× antibiotic/antimycotic solution, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 10% fetal calf serum (17Hynes N.E. Taverna D. Harwerth I.M. Ciardiello F. Salomon D.S. Yamamoto T. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4027-4034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2, fed every 2 days, and split 1:4 when at or near confluency. Cells were routinely differentiated by growing them to confluency in the presence of EGF and then shifting them into the above medium with 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in the absence of EGF. Cells were exposed to cycloheximide or ethanol (vehicle) after 2 days of growth in EGF-free medium or shifted at this point into dexamethasone/insulin/prolactin medium as described (17Hynes N.E. Taverna D. Harwerth I.M. Ciardiello F. Salomon D.S. Yamamoto T. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4027-4034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein synthesis was determined as described (18Itani O.A. Cornish K.L. Liu K.Z. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F778-F787Google Scholar). Briefly, HC11 cells were grown to confluency on 6-well plates in the presence of EGF and then shifted to medium with 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in the absence of EGF for an additional 48 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 10 min with methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 2 h with the same medium supplemented with 15 Ci/ml [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of cycloheximide or puromycin at the indicated concentrations. At the end of the labeling period, cells were washed twice with PBS on ice and twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid and then solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.25 n NaOH. Equal aliquots were counted by liquid scintillation. RNA Quantitation—Quantitative fluorescence RT-PCR was conducted as described previously (10McManaman J.L. Hanson L. Neville M.C. Wright R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. RNA was isolated from PBS-washed HC11 cells using TRIzol reagent. 50 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed for 55 min at 45 °C in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μg of oligo(dT), 2 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, and 0.5 μl of RNase inhibitor (Eppendorf-5 Prime, Inc.) in 1× RT buffer using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (C master kit, Eppendor-5 Prime, Inc.). 2 μl of cDNA was then used for each PCR. RT-PCRs were quantitated on an Applied Biosystems 310 genetic analyzer as described (10McManaman J.L. Hanson L. Neville M.C. Wright R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). RT-PCR experiments were performed in triplicate and normalized to the β-actin control. Data are expressed as the mean normalized fluorescence ± S.E. Independent RT-PCRs for XOR and β-actin were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis and photographed. Negative controls for cDNA synthesis were run without template or without reverse transcriptase. The primers used in RT-PCR were as follows: XOR, 5′-Hex-GCCGCTGTACAGGCTATAGACCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCTTGGTACCTCTAGATGCG-3′ (reverse); and β-actin, 5′-carboxyfluorescein-GGCCCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTATCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGCACAGCCTGGATGGCTACG-3′ (reverse). SDS-PAGE and Western Immunoblot Analysis—HC11 cells were grown in 6-well plates until confluent, switched to 2% heat-inactivated serum in the absence of EGF for 48 h, and then treated with cycloheximide for the indicated times. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in cell lysis buffer A (2 mm dithiothreitol, 2.0% SDS, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, and a 1:5000 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem)), sonicated for 15 s, and kept on ice. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined as described (4Wright R.M. Ginger L.A. Kosila N. Elkins N.D. Essary B. McManaman J.L. Repine J.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 50 μg of protein were incubated with equal amounts of loading buffer (5% β-mercaptoethanol and 95% Laemmli loading dye) for 10 min at 37 °C and then boiled for 2 min. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for 40 min at 75 V, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN), and blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween at 4 °C. Membranes were then incubated with antibodies against C/EBPβ, phospho-C/EBPβ, p38α, p38β, and phospho-p38 MAPK. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by reaction with an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Each experiment was run in triplicate, and representative immunoblots are shown. Mouse XOR Promoter Cloning, Plasmid Construction, and Mutagenesis—An in-frame fusion to the luciferase translational start site of the luciferase expression vector pGL3-Basic (Promega Corp.) was constructed exactly as indicated previously (19Wright R.M. Weigel L.K. Varella-Garcia M. Vaitaitis G. Repine J.E. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, upstream DNA to be cloned into pGL3-Basic was amplified by PCR, combining sequences from the mouse XOR cDNA and chromosomal locus (20Terao M. Cazzaniga G. Ghezzi P. Bianchi M. Falciani F. Perani P. Garattini E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Cazzaniga G. Terao M. Schiavo P.L. Galbiati F. Segalla F. Seldin M.F. Garattini E. Genomics. 1994; 23: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This region of the mouse genome has been cloned on bacterial artificial chromosome RPCI-23 (clone RP23-173019, GenBank™ accession number AC101679.8, GI:33147367), which served as a template for PCR. The resulting PCR product was cleaved with XhoI and NcoI and cloned in the forward orientation into pGL3-Basic. The mouse promoter fusion clone (pMXOR-B1) comprises 1000 bp of the XOR upstream DNA fused at the translational start site to luciferase. This region contains the functional mouse proximal promoter identified previously and 700 bp of additional upstream DNA (21Cazzaniga G. Terao M. Schiavo P.L. Galbiati F. Segalla F. Seldin M.F. Garattini E. Genomics. 1994; 23: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Xu P. LaVallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Luciferase fusion constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis as described (19Wright R.M. Weigel L.K. Varella-Garcia M. Vaitaitis G. Repine J.E. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fluorescence sequence analysis was performed using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Reactions were carried out using the ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kits (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequence reactions were fractionated on an ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencer equipped with a 47-cm microcapillary (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All sequences were determined from both directions, and sequence data were compiled manually. 3Oligonucleotides used as sequencing primers are available upon request. The putative C/EBP-binding site (nucleotides -140 to -170) (see Fig. 8) identified in mouse XOR upstream DNA by sequence analysis (11Kurosaki M. Zanotta S. Calzi M.L. Garattini E. Terao M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was mutated by sequence exchange using PCR amplification of pMXOR-B1. The C/EBP core-binding site (5′-ATTGTGCAAA-3′) was replaced with 5′-AAGGGCCCAA-3′ as follows. The C/EBP forward primer (5′-CTGGTCCTTCCTGGAAGGGCCCAACCTGTGACTCTTG-′3) was paired with a distant primer (5′-GGAGCTGACTGGGGTGAAGGC-3′) in one PCR, whereas the C/EBP reverse primer (5′-CAAGAGTCACAGGTTGGGCCCTTCCAGGAAGGACCAG-3′) was paired with a distant primer (5′-CAGGTTCAGGGGGAGGTGTGG-3′). PCR products were cleaved with BamHI and ApaI, gel-purified, ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and transformed into F′ negative TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). Candidate plasmids were screened for retention of single NcoI and KpnI sites as well as BamHI and ApaI sites. Appropriate clones were sequenced across the entire 1000 bp of the mouse XOR upstream region to confirm the exchange and the absence of unanticipated changes in sequence. The C/EBP exchange construct is called pMXOR-mut17. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells to be transfected were grown to 50-70% confluency in 6-well plates and shifted to 2 ml of fresh medium 1 h prior to transfection. Transfections were conducted using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) essentially as described by the supplier. 1.7 μg of total plasmid was mixed with FuGENE 6 in 0.1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing sodium bicarbonate with or without 10% fetal bovine serum as indicated below. After mixing, the transfecting solution was held at room temperature for 30 min and then applied to cells in a single well of a 6-well plate. Cells were harvested for analysis after 24 or 48 h of incubation. Cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity in cell culture lysis reagent (Promega Corp.) using a BMG LABTECH Lumistar luminometer. As reported previously (22Xu P. LaVallee P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5918-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), uniformity of data and transfection efficiency were determined by a minimum of six independent transfections because, in all cases, β-galactosidase cotransfection plasmids suppressed the activity of the XOR reporter. Luciferase activity was normalized to total cytoplasmic protein as determined spectrophotometrically using the Lowry assay (4Wright R.M. Ginger L.A. Kosila N. Elkins N.D. Essary B. McManaman J.L. Repine J.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Each individual transfection was assayed in quadruplicate, and each individual transfection was repeated six times; thus, each value reported represents 24 biochemical assays for each parameter. Luciferase values represent arbitrary light units/mg of protein/min. Means ± S.D. were calculated for each group, and in most cases, S.D. values were no greater than 10% of the mean value. Comparisons between groups were made using Student's t test. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), PCR, and Quantitation—ChIP analysis was performed essentially as described (23Bradley M.N. Zhou L.

HC11 cells were grown in T75 flasks as described above and treated with vehicle (control cells) or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide or pretreated with 20 μm SB202190 and exposed to 10 μg/ml cycloheximide 45 min later. Cells from three T75 flasks (8 × 107 cells) were prepared for ChIP 5 h after exposure to cycloheximide. After refreshing the low serum EGF-free medium, cells were cross-linked with 1% freshly prepared formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Glycine was added to 125 mm, and cells incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing fresh protease inhibitors, scraped into PBS, and sedimented. Pelleted cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in cell lysis buffer B (5 mm PIPES (pH 8.0), 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were harvested by sedimentation and lysed in a total volume of 3.2 ml for 10 min on ice in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclear lysates were sonicated in 400-μl aliquots on ice for six bursts of 20 s using a Branson sonicator at a setting of 50 with an amplitude of 20 and a tuned setting of 40. Cells were held on ice for at least 1 min between sonications. Debris was sedimented at 11,000 × g for 10 minat4 °C, and chromatin was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. 5 × 106 nuclear eq were precleared in a total volume of 8 ml for each immunoprecipitation with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C in chromatin dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 167 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm EDTA, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After sedimentation of the Sepharose beads, 1.60 ml from each tube was removed for analysis of input DNA, and chromatin was then incubated overnight without or with 10 μg of either anti-C/EBPβ antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-150) or isotype control antibody at 4 °C. As an additional control, a no-chromatin sample was also precipitated with 10 μg of antibody C-19. Immunoprecipitates were collected with 60 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C, and beads were washed sequentially with low salt, high salt, LiCl, and Tris/EDTA as recommended by Upstate. Chromatin was eluted from the beads in a total of 400 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) in two steps and frozen at -80 °C. Cross-links were reversed, and samples were treated with RNase A and precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. Samples were resuspended in 100 μl of water and treated with proteinase K as recommended by Upstate, and DNA was purified on spin columns. DNA was eluted from the spin columns in a volume of 100 μl, extracted in phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, reprecipitated, and suspended in 50 μl of Tris/EDTA. Cross-link reversal, RNase A and proteinase K treatment, and DNA purification of input chromatin were conducted in an identical fashion. 5 or 10 μl of ChIP DNA or 1.0 μl of input DNA (2 × 104 nuclear eq) was amplified by PCR in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2 using AmpliTaq polymerase (Applied Biosystems). PCR conditions were as follows: 1) one cycle at 95 °C for 1 min; 2) six cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s decreasing 1°/cycle, and 72 °C for 30 s; 3) 31 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C, for 30 s; and 4) one cycle at 72 °C for 2 min 30 s, and then cooling to 4 °C. PCR primers were designed to span 284 bp of mouse XOR upstream DNA comprising nucleotides -1 through -284 and including the proximal promoter. The sequences of the upstream and downstream primers were 5′-AGAATTCACAGTCATCTGGTGCC-3′ and 5′-CGTGACGGCCGGAGTCCCCGAGC-3′, respectively. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Ethidium bromide-stained gels were photographed under ultraviolet illumination using a Kodak Gel Logic 200 imaging system, scanned, and quantitated using Kodak 1D image analysis software (Version 3.6). Preparation of Nuclei and Nuclear Proteins—Nuclei were prepared from hypotonically swollen cells by lysis in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and differential centrifugation as described previously (26Wright R.M. Riley M.G. Weigel L.K. Ginger L.A. Costantino D.A. McManaman J.L. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with the present addition of 2 mm sodium vanadate and 1 mm NaF in each buffer. Proteins were leached from isolated and washed nuclei by incubation in 320 mm potassium buffer as described (26Wright R.M. Riley M.G. Weigel L.K. Ginger L.A. Costantino D.A. McManaman J.L. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nuclear preparations were routinely followed microscopically and were estimated to contain >95% nuclei with no more than 5% cellular contamination. Following sedimentation at 10,000 × g to remove extracted nuclei, protein solutions were stored at -70 °C in high salt buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 320 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, and 2 mm Na2VO4. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) Analysis—A synthetic double-strand oligonucleotide corresponding to mouse XOR nucleotides -140 through -170 and spanning the consensus C/EBP-binding site of the proximal promoter (21Cazzaniga G.
