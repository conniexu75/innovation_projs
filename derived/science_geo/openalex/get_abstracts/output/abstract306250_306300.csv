https://openalex.org/W2040449064,"The rates of reactions of silicates and aqueous fluids follow zero-order kinetics controlled by the reacting surface area with the rate constant given by the equation: log k[unknown] -2900/T -6.85, where T is temperature and where k has the unit's gram-atoms of oxygen per square centimeter per second. This expression appears to hold for all silicates and for reactions involving dissolution, fluid production, or solid-solid transformations in the presence of a fluid of moderate to high pH."
https://openalex.org/W1993669993,"Esterase 6, a component of the seminal fluid of Drosophila melanogaster males, hydrolyzes cis-vaccenyl acetate, a lipid made only by males, to cis-vaccenyl alcohol. This reaction occurs in the female reproductive tract and is virtually complete within 6 hours after copulation. Both the alcohol and the acetate decrease the number of matings among pairs of virgin flies in which the female is treated topically with these substances. Although females tested 10 minutes after copulation elicit less courtship than virgin females, females tested 6 hours after copulation stimulate even less courtship if they received active esterase 6 in the seminal fluid of their respective mates. Either the alcohol or a derivative appears to be an antiaphrodisiac that decreases courtship elicited by inseminated females and thus reduces the probability of further mating. Thus the activity of the pheromone depends on a final reaction which occurs in the female, using both substrate and enzyme provided by the male."
https://openalex.org/W1966669757,"Historic dry fogs in Europe, acid precipitation in Greenland, and major explosive volcanic eruptions correlate well with each other between 1500 B.C. and A.D. 1500. European (Mediterranean and Icelandic) volcanic eruptions appear to be the source of at least five of the nine largest acidity signals found in Greenland ice for this period. Between 152 B.C. and A.D. 43, eruptions of sulfur-rich Mount Etna probably supplied about 15 percent of the smaller acidity signals."

Electron density was observed between molecules in a stack of donors of an organic metal and between certain interstack selenium atoms of these donors."
