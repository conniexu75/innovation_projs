https://openalex.org/W2005895632,"The elucidation of breast cancer subgroups and their molecular drivers requires integrated views of the genome and transcriptome from representative numbers of patients. We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in ∼40% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting CNAs. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA–RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘CNA-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic CNAs on the transcriptome. Integrative analysis of copy number and gene expression in 2,000 primary breast tumours with long-term clinical follow-up revealed putative cis-acting driver genes, novel subgroups and trans-acting aberration hotspots that modulate subgroup-specific gene networks."
https://openalex.org/W2011377242,"Mechanisms in Methanol Catalysis The industrial production of methanol from hydrogen and carbon monoxide depends on the use of copper and zinc oxide nanoparticles on alumina oxide supports. This catalyst is “structure sensitive”; its activity can vary by orders of magnitude, depending on how it is prepared. Behrens et al. (p. 893 , published online 19 April; see the Perspective by Greeley ) used a combination of bulk and surface-sensitive analysis and imaging methods—along with insights from density functional theory calculations—to study several catalysts, including the one similar to that used industrially. High activity depended on the presence of steps on the copper nanoparticles stabilized by defects such as stacking faults. Partial coverage of the copper nanoparticles with zinc oxide was critical for stabilizing surface intermediates such as HCO and lowering energetic barriers to the methanol product."

Often these electrodes are metals, such as calcium, that are not stable in air or water vapor and have to be protected from environmental damage. Zhou et al. (p. 327 ; see the Perspective by Helander ) report that a coating polymer containing aliphatic amine groups can lower the work functions of various types of electrodes by up to 1.7 electron volts and can be used in a variety of devices."
https://openalex.org/W2066907097,"Himalayan glaciers are a focus of public and scientific debate. Prevailing uncertainties are of major concern because some projections of their future have serious implications for water resources. Most Himalayan glaciers are losing mass at rates similar to glaciers elsewhere, except for emerging indications of stability or mass gain in the Karakoram. A poor understanding of the processes affecting them, combined with the diversity of climatic conditions and the extremes of topographical relief within the region, makes projections speculative. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that dramatic changes in total runoff will occur soon, although continuing shrinkage outside the Karakoram will increase the seasonality of runoff, affect irrigation and hydropower, and alter hazards."
https://openalex.org/W2082183045,"The neural correlates of how attended speech is internally represented are described, shedding light on the ‘cocktail party problem’. The 'cocktail-party problem' — the question of what goes on in our brains when we listen selectively for one person's voice while ignoring many others — has puzzled researchers from various disciplines for years. Using electrophysiological recordings from neurosurgery patients listening to two speakers simultaneously, Nima Mesgarani and Edward Chang determine the neural correlates associated with the internal representation of attended speech. They find that the neural responses in the auditory cortex represent the attended voice robustly, almost as if the second voice were not there. With these patterns established, a simple algorithm trained on various speakers predicts which stimulus a subject is attending to, on the basis of the patterns emerging in the secondary auditory cortex. These results suggest that speech representation in the brain reflects not only the acoustic environment, but also the listener's understanding of these signals. As well as shedding light on a long-standing neurobiological problem, this work may give clues as to how automatic speech recognition might be improved to cope with more than one talker. Humans possess a remarkable ability to attend to a single speaker’s voice in a multi-talker background1,2,3. How the auditory system manages to extract intelligible speech under such acoustically complex and adverse listening conditions is not known, and, indeed, it is not clear how attended speech is internally represented4,5. Here, using multi-electrode surface recordings from the cortex of subjects engaged in a listening task with two simultaneous speakers, we demonstrate that population responses in non-primary human auditory cortex encode critical features of attended speech: speech spectrograms reconstructed based on cortical responses to the mixture of speakers reveal the salient spectral and temporal features of the attended speaker, as if subjects were listening to that speaker alone. A simple classifier trained solely on examples of single speakers can decode both attended words and speaker identity. We find that task performance is well predicted by a rapid increase in attention-modulated neural selectivity across both single-electrode and population-level cortical responses. These findings demonstrate that the cortical representation of speech does not merely reflect the external acoustic environment, but instead gives rise to the perceptual aspects relevant for the listener’s intended goal."
https://openalex.org/W2042898130,"Climb Every Mountain Mountaintop floras across Europe appear to be responding to climatic change in terms of upslope species range shifts. Pauli et al. (p. 353 ) systematically analyzed data gathered from standardized permanent plots on 66 high-mountain environments across Europe. On average, mountaintop species numbers have increased significantly during the last decade. However, this increase is a net effect of gains and losses, with losses particularly affecting mountains of Mediterranean regions and their endemic species. This turnover is largely consistent with model predictions and indicates that high-altitude species, and in particular the rich endemic alpine flora of many Mediterranean mountain ranges, will come under increasing pressure in the predicted warmer and drier climates in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2071975518,"Salicylate, a plant product, has been in medicinal use since ancient times. More recently, it has been replaced by synthetic derivatives such as aspirin and salsalate, both of which are rapidly broken down to salicylate in vivo. At concentrations reached in plasma after administration of salsalate or of aspirin at high doses, salicylate activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Salicylate binds at the same site as the synthetic activator A-769662 to cause allosteric activation and inhibition of dephosphorylation of the activating phosphorylation site, threonine-172. In AMPK knockout mice, effects of salicylate to increase fat utilization and to lower plasma fatty acids in vivo were lost. Our results suggest that AMPK activation could explain some beneficial effects of salsalate and aspirin in humans."

But there are variations on this theme, and Pinheiro et al. (p. 341 ; see the Perspective by Joyce ) describe the directed evolution of unnatural nucleic acid–like genetic polymers. Variant enzymes were developed that efficiently transcribed DNA to anhydrohexitol (HNA), cyclohexenyl (CeNA), locked (LNA), and threofuranosyl (TNA) nuceic acid analogs. Further variant enzymes were developed to reverse-transcribe these analogs back to DNA. Thus, man-made nucleic acid analogs can be designed and selected that have the potential to operate in a way analogous to the natural process of heredity and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2121484182,"Balanced chromosomal abnormalities (BCAs) represent a relatively untapped reservoir of single-gene disruptions in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). We sequenced BCAs in patients with autism or related NDDs, revealing disruption of 33 loci in four general categories: (1) genes previously associated with abnormal neurodevelopment (e.g., AUTS2, FOXP1, and CDKL5), (2) single-gene contributors to microdeletion syndromes (MBD5, SATB2, EHMT1, and SNURF-SNRPN), (3) novel risk loci (e.g., CHD8, KIRREL3, and ZNF507), and (4) genes associated with later-onset psychiatric disorders (e.g., TCF4, ZNF804A, PDE10A, GRIN2B, and ANK3). We also discovered among neurodevelopmental cases a profoundly increased burden of copy-number variants from these 33 loci and a significant enrichment of polygenic risk alleles from genome-wide association studies of autism and schizophrenia. Our findings suggest a polygenic risk model of autism and reveal that some neurodevelopmental genes are sensitive to perturbation by multiple mutational mechanisms, leading to variable phenotypic outcomes that manifest at different life stages. Balanced chromosomal abnormalities (BCAs) represent a relatively untapped reservoir of single-gene disruptions in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).

Our findings suggest a polygenic risk model of autism and reveal that some neurodevelopmental genes are sensitive to perturbation by multiple mutational mechanisms, leading to variable phenotypic outcomes that manifest at different life stages. Mechanisms of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation implicated in autism Balanced chromosomal abnormality breakpoints harbor individual strong-effect genes Dosage-sensitive loci confer risk to autism from a spectrum of mutational mechanisms Different alterations in a gene are associated with diverse clinical outcomes Mounting evidence indicates that genomic structural variants (SVs) collectively play a substantial role in susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, the near ubiquitous use of chromosomal microarrays in research and clinical diagnostics has limited the assessment of those classes of SV that do not involve large gains and losses of genetic material, such as inversions, excision/insertions, and translocations, which together constitute balanced chromosomal abnormalities (BCAs). These events are typically defined clinically at karyotypic resolution and implicate only broad chromosomal regions, without the gene-level sequence specificity that would permit informative interpretation. Even in the research setting, there is often a failure to consider or assess BCAs, consequently bypassing a meaningful proportion of subjects with genetic events that may mark a single locus of potentially large effect. These balanced events offer a unique route, complementary to conventional approaches, for identifying individual genes or functional sequences that contribute to otherwise genetically complex human disorders. At cytogenetic resolution, the estimated frequency of BCAs in ASD is 1.3% (Marshall et al., 2008Marshall C.R. Noor A. Vincent J.B. Lionel A.C. Feuk L. Skaug J. Shago M. Moessner R. Pinto D. Ren Y. et al.Structural variation of chromosomes in autism spectrum disorder.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 82: 477-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar), an approximately 6-fold increase over that observed in more than 10,000 reproductively normal controls (Ravel et al., 2006Ravel C.

Genetics Commission of the French Federation of CECOSPrevalence of chromosomal abnormalities in phenotypically normal and fertile adult males: large-scale survey of over 10,000 sperm donor karyotypes.Hum. Reprod. 2006; 21: 1484-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This ratio is almost certainly a lower bound for relative risk, given the resolution of available techniques and the inability to survey submicroscopic balanced alterations. Thus, BCAs have a meaningful impact in ASD and represent a fertile area for high-resolution study to identify functional sequences that contribute to human neurodevelopment. We previously described innovations in the molecular approach to massively parallel sequencing and tailored bioinformatics applicable to the rapid, high-resolution discovery of chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints (Talkowski et al., 2011aTalkowski M.E.

These and conceptually similar methods were recently used to derive potential mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangements in B-lymphocytes (Chiarle et al., 2011Chiarle R. Zhang Y. Frock R.L. Lewis S.M.

Genet. 2012; 44: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Here, with nucleotide resolution, we precisely characterize karyotypically defined human constitutional chromosomal rearrangements: 36 de novo BCAs and two inherited rearrangements that were transmitted from an affected parent. The results of our sequencing analyses, coupled with extensive secondary genomics support, indicate that disruption of genes from a wide range of biological pathways can contribute to ASD. In many instances, the same genes also confer risk, sometimes via different mutational mechanisms, to a range of NDDs and psychiatric disorders in both children and adults. Using a series of previously developed next-generation sequencing techniques ranging from high-depth whole-genome sequencing to a targeted capture of breakpoints approach (Talkowski et al., 2011aTalkowski M.E. Ernst C. Heilbut A. Chiang C. Hanscom C. Lindgren A. Kirby A. Liu S. Muddukrishna B.

Genet. 2011; 88: 469-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we delineated BCAs in 38 subjects with neurodevelopmental abnormalities; these subjects include two monozygotic twin pairs (36 independent probands). All harbored a BCA that appeared balanced at karyotypic resolution and was interpreted as pathogenic by the clinical geneticist; 36 aberrations arose de novo, whereas two alterations were transmitted from an affected parent and thus segregated with the phenotype. Extensive clinical data were collected for all subjects and affected parents, as described in the Supplemental Information (available online). If a structured diagnostic interview was performed, or a patient was formally diagnosed with autism or an ASD by the referring clinician according to DSM-IV criteria, they are referred to herein as ASD (50% of subjects); otherwise the disorder was classified as NDD, although many such subjects also displayed clinical features consistent with ASD. For complete clinical information for each subject and each BCA breakpoint, confirmed by PCR and capillary sequencing, see Data S1: Phenotypic and Sequencing Information on Individual Patients. Previously performed genetic testing was also obtained, and all results were unremarkable with 244,000 or 1 million feature array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) unless otherwise described in the Supplemental Information. This BCA sequencing approach uncovered genes that conformed to four general classifications, and there was meaningful overlap between categories: (1) genes previously implicated in ASD or NDD and confirmed here by their heterozygous inactivation, (2) genes discovered to be single-locus contributors to microdeletion syndromes, (3) genes not previously implicated individually in ASD or NDD, and (4) genes previously associated with adolescent- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders by common variant genome-wide association studies (GWASs) or other approaches; all but three of these represent novel ASD or NDD loci. Alterations in gene expression were also assessed for all subjects where a lymphoblastoid cell line could be obtained (33 of 38 subjects; Figure S1). If a gene was not directly disrupted, positional effects on expression were evaluated for genes in proximity to the breakpoint. All genes and sequences disrupted by BCAs are presented in Table S1 along with results of mRNA expression studies, whereas the subset of genes, supported by secondary analyses, is presented below and in Table 1.Table 1Genes Disrupted by Chromosomal RearrangementsaBCA-disrupted genes individually implicated by case-control CNV burden at uncorrected p < 0.10 or by a minimum of 3 CNVs in cases with none in controls are provided.

For the entire data set used to generate this table, see also Tables S1, S2, and S3. Although the presence of a BCA is conservatively associated with an ∼6-fold increased risk of ASD, any individual BCA is rare and generally nonrecurrent, precluding assessment of false discovery by replication; consequently, we analyzed copy-number variants (CNVs) to test whether specific locus hemizygosity contributes to genetic risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. We curated and analyzed a large collection of 33,573 cases from molecular diagnostic facilities and identified that subset of cases referred for a variety of neurodevelopmental abnormalities (n = 19,556), as well as that comprising cases without a referral indication of NDD (n = 14,017). We also surveyed CNV data from 13,991 controls screened for absence of a reported developmental or psychiatric phenotype. Although almost 25% of the 19,556 cases with neurodevelopmental abnormalities were referred for testing with an indication of autism or ASD, we did not have direct access to clinical records to confirm this diagnosis so we conservatively describe these cases by using the broader term NDD. Our findings indicate that genes disrupted by BCAs in ASD individuals frequently show increased CNV burden across the diagnostic cases referred for ASD as well as those referred for other neurodevelopmental abnormalities, suggesting that the genes discovered can contribute to phenotypic outcomes that are not constrained by ASD diagnostic criteria. An example of the convergent genomic information collected in this study is depicted in Figure 1; sequencing of monozygotic twins with extensive clinical information revealed a translocation disrupting TCF4, a gene previously implicated in both Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and schizophrenia, with concomitantly decreased mRNA expression in both subjects and a significant impact of CNV burden across the clinical diagnostic samples (14 case CNVs, 0 control CNVs; p = 0.0006). Additional follow-up analyses revealed a significant GWAS signal from common SNPs at TCF4 in both autism and schizophrenia (see analyses of polygenic risk from GWAS studies below and in Table S2). Across all loci disrupted by BCAs, a dramatic increase in overall CNV burden was observed in cases compared to controls (CNV burden across 33 loci: p = 2.07 × 10−47, odds ratio [OR] = 5.12, 95% CI = 3.92–6.79), and this result remained robust to subset analyses and 1 million random simulations to assess empirical significance (see Table S2 for CNV results and Extended Experimental Procedures for analysis details). Comparison of the NDD cases to the 14,017 diagnostic cases referred for a primary indication other than NDD and analyzed on identical platforms also showed an increased CNV burden across these genes (p = 1.8 × 10−5), a result that again exceeded the significance of 1 million random simulations despite the previously established enrichment of large CNVs in the latter cases, which we replicate here. Notably, restricting CNV analyses to only those genes disrupted by a BCA in an individual with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD was also highly significant (p = 2.76 × 10−28; Table 1). Individually, increased CNV burden was nominally significant for 14 of the genes in this study, with three nonsignificant trends (p < 0.10), whereas five additional genes were disrupted by CNVs in three or more independent cases but never altered in controls. For the latter, the rarity of dosage alteration in cases and absence of alterations in controls limit statistical power but are consistent with a strong deleterious effect. In each category discussed further below, the genes supported by secondary CNVs are briefly mentioned and presented in Table 1, whereas the full list of genes disrupted by BCAs is delineated in Table S1 and discussed in the Supplemental Information. The power of sequencing BCAs as a discovery tool for loci contributing to disease etiology is illustrated in our independent identification of several genes previously suggested as candidates in ASD or NDD. We found direct disruption of AUTS2 and CDKL5, two established neurodevelopmental loci (Bakkaloglu et al., 2008Bakkaloglu B. O'Roak B.J. Louvi A. Gupta A.R. Abelson J.F. Morgan T.M. Chawarska K.

We also found disruption of the fork-head transcription factor FOXP1 and the glutamate receptor GRIN2B, genes identified from de novo mutations in ASD by an exome-sequencing study (O'Roak et al., 2011O'Roak B.J.

Microdeletion syndromes, which contribute to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, typically involve hemizygosity of large genomic regions where the difficulty of defining specific genes responsible for core phenotypes has been an obstacle for clinical genetics, predictive diagnostics, and the study of disease pathogenesis. BCA sequencing in three ASD subjects pinpointed three individual gene contributors to microdeletion syndromes, each of which is involved in transcriptional and/or epigenetic regulation, in the 2q23.1, 2q33.1, and 9q34.3 microdeletion syndrome regions, respectively. In 2q23.1, a translocation disrupted MBD5, a member of the methyl-CpG binding domain protein family defined by a highly conserved methyl binding domain and including MeCP2, a causal locus in Rett syndrome. An international consortium follow-up study recently found 65 structural variations spanning the 2q23.1 microdeletion region in cases with syndromic features, including ASD, seizures, and intellectual disability, establishing MBD5 as a necessary, sufficient, and predictive locus for a majority of the phenotypic features of the 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome (Talkowski et al., 2011bTalkowski M.E.

In a fourth region (15q11-13), the nested genes SNURF-SNRPN were disrupted at 15q11.2 in a subject with ASD and multiple developmental abnormalities, including sensory integration disorder, but without Angelman or Prader-Willi syndromes, both of which result from imprinting within the region. Our data argue for increased resolution and interpretation from molecular diagnostic testing of regional disorders, particularly for loci in which individual gene disruptions can yield phenotypes that are similar to or indistinguishable from that defining the syndrome. Given their localization to syndromic regions, it is not surprising that CNV analysis of genes in this category reflected a strong impact in neurodevelopment (p = 1.64 × 10−26; OR = 10.2) (Table 2 and Figure 3). BCA sequencing yielded 22 novel ASD/NDD candidate genes that, like the genes in categories 1 and 2, are also likely to contribute to the neurodevelopmental phenotype in the corresponding subjects. The collective increase in CNV burden for these candidates was highly significant (p = 2.21 × 10−15, OR = 4.1) (Table 2). The most significant individual genes are two loci localized to previously identified genomic disorder regions (KIRREL3 and SMG6) and one encoding a DNA helicase (CHD8). Similar to the category 2 genes, we observed dysregulation by BCA and secondary CNV support for novel genes in regions associated with classic terminal deletion disorders: KIRREL3 in 11q24.1 (Jacobsen syndrome) and SMG6 in 17p13.3 (Miller-Dieker syndrome). KIRREL3 encodes a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin family expressed in developing and adult brain of mouse and developing sensory pathways (Morikawa et al., 2007Morikawa Y. Komori T.

The locus was disrupted by a BCA 39.6 kb upstream of the mRNA coding region that altered both mRNA and protein levels (Table 1 and Figure S2). Disruption of SMG6 nominates nonsense-mediated decay as another pathway in ASD and NDD, but not necessarily in the lissencephaly phenotype commonly seen in Miller-Dieker syndrome (see Supplemental Information and Figure S3).

Although it has never been individually linked to a human disorder, it represents a strong autism and NDD candidate locus. It was disrupted by a BCA in a subject diagnosed with ASD (Table 1 and Data S1: Phenotypic and Sequencing Information on Individual Patients), was supported by our CNV analyses (Table S2, see also genes sensitive to dosage dysregulation section below), and was among the loci within the minimal region of overlap from previous analyses of de novo microdeletions (Zahir et al., 2007Zahir F.

Ensembles of such atoms interact strongly, sometimes leading to blockade effects where the excitation of one atom prevents the excitation of another. Dudin and Kuzmich (p. 887 , published online 19 April; see the Perspective by Grangier ) demonstrate the generation of a many-body excitation with no more than one Rydberg atom in a mesoscopic ensemble of ultracold atoms. When the principal quantum number was increased beyond 70, the excitation was converted into a photon. The ability to control the creation of excitations provides a promising system for quantum information storage, as well as a source of correlated photons."

Our efforts to understand why DinB (DNA polymerase IV) overproduction is cytotoxic to Escherichia coli led to the unexpected insight that oxidation of guanine to 8-oxo-guanine in the nucleotide pool underlies much of the cell death caused by both DinB overproduction and bactericidal antibiotics. We propose a model in which the cytotoxicity of beta-lactams and quinolones predominantly results from lethal double-strand DNA breaks caused by incomplete repair of closely spaced 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine lesions, whereas the cytotoxicity of aminoglycosides might additionally result from mistranslation due to the incorporation of 8-oxo-guanine into newly synthesized RNAs."

In the GRB ‘fireball’ model, cosmic-ray acceleration should be accompanied by neutrinos produced in the decay of charged pions created in interactions between the high-energy cosmic-ray protons and γ-rays4. Previous searches for such neutrinos found none, but the constraints were weak because the sensitivity was at best approximately equal to the predicted flux5,6,7. Here we report an upper limit on the flux of energetic neutrinos associated with GRBs that is at least a factor of 3.7 below the predictions4,8,9,10.

Bayesian coalescent analyses place polar bears outside the brown bear clade and date the divergence much earlier, in the middle Pleistocene, about 600 (338 to 934) thousand years ago. This provides more time for polar bear evolution and confirms previous suggestions that polar bears carry introgressed brown bear mitochondrial DNA due to past hybridization.

https://openalex.org/W2006218021,"A hundred years after the discovery of superconductivity, one fundamental prediction of the theory, coherent quantum phase slip (CQPS), has not been observed. CQPS is a phenomenon exactly dual to the Josephson effect; whereas the latter is a coherent transfer of charges between superconducting leads, the former is a coherent transfer of vortices or fluxes across a superconducting wire. In contrast to previously reported observations of incoherent phase slip, CQPS has been only a subject of theoretical study. Its experimental demonstration is made difficult by quasiparticle dissipation due to gapless excitations in nanowires or in vortex cores. This difficulty might be overcome by using certain strongly disordered superconductors near the superconductor-insulator transition. Here we report direct observation of CQPS in a narrow segment of a superconducting loop made of strongly disordered indium oxide; the effect is made manifest through the superposition of quantum states with different numbers of flux quanta. As with the Josephson effect, our observation should lead to new applications in superconducting electronics and quantum metrology."
https://openalex.org/W2153102033,"PPARγ induces fibroblast growth factor 1 to remodel visceral adipose tissue in response to a high-fat diet to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and the other known FGF family proteins have been implicated in a range of physiological processes but, surprisingly, FGF1 knockout mice display no obvious abnormality. Here the authors show that FGF1 is induced in visceral adipose tissue in response to a high-fat diet. This induction of FGF1 in the fed state is regulated by the nuclear receptor PPARγ. Mice without FGF1 have an impaired metabolic response of visceral adipose in response to high-fat diet, and develop an aggressive diabetic phenotype coupled to aberrant adipose expansion. The discovery of a phenotype for the FGF1 knockout mouse establishes the PPARγ–FGF1 axis as crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitization. Although feast and famine cycles illustrate that remodelling of adipose tissue in response to fluctuations in nutrient availability is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood1,2. Here we identify fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) as a critical transducer in this process in mice, and link its regulation to the nuclear receptor PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ), which is the adipocyte master regulator and the target of the thiazolidinedione class of insulin sensitizing drugs3,4,5. FGF1 is the prototype of the 22-member FGF family of proteins and has been implicated in a range of physiological processes, including development, wound healing and cardiovascular changes6. Surprisingly, FGF1 knockout mice display no significant phenotype under standard laboratory conditions7,8,9. We show that FGF1 is highly induced in adipose tissue in response to a high-fat diet and that mice lacking FGF1 develop an aggressive diabetic phenotype coupled to aberrant adipose expansion when challenged with a high-fat diet. Further analysis of adipose depots in FGF1-deficient mice revealed multiple histopathologies in the vasculature network, an accentuated inflammatory response, aberrant adipocyte size distribution and ectopic expression of pancreatic lipases. On withdrawal of the high-fat diet, this inflamed adipose tissue fails to properly resolve, resulting in extensive fat necrosis. In terms of mechanisms, we show that adipose induction of FGF1 in the fed state is regulated by PPARγ acting through an evolutionarily conserved promoter proximal PPAR response element within the FGF1 gene. The discovery of a phenotype for the FGF1 knockout mouse establishes the PPARγ–FGF1 axis as critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitization."

https://openalex.org/W2038732878,"Kevin Campbell and colleagues identify mutations in ISPD as a cause of Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) using a complementation assay in fibroblasts derived from affected individuals and targeted sequencing. They find that loss-of-function mutations in ISPD disrupt dystroglycan O-mannosylation, suggesting a new disease mechanism. Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) is clinically defined as congenital muscular dystrophy that is accompanied by a variety of brain and eye malformations. It represents the most severe clinical phenotype in a spectrum of diseases associated with abnormal post-translational processing of α-dystroglycan that share a defect in laminin-binding glycan synthesis1. Although mutations in six genes have been identified as causes of WWS, only half of all individuals with the disease can currently be diagnosed on this basis2. A cell fusion complementation assay in fibroblasts from undiagnosed individuals with WWS was used to identify five new complementation groups. Further evaluation of one group by linkage analysis and targeted sequencing identified recessive mutations in the ISPD gene (encoding isoprenoid synthase domain containing). The pathogenicity of the identified ISPD mutations was shown by complementation of fibroblasts with wild-type ISPD. Finally, we show that recessive mutations in ISPD abolish the initial step in laminin-binding glycan synthesis by disrupting dystroglycan O-mannosylation. This establishes a new mechanism for WWS pathophysiology."

Sepsis was associated with the systemic spread of a specific multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli pathobiont that expanded markedly in the microbiota of antibiotic-treated mice. Rapid sepsis-like death required a component of the innate immune system, the Naip5-Nlrc4 inflammasome. In accordance with Koch's postulates, we found the E. coli pathobiont was sufficient to activate Naip5-Nlrc4 and cause disease when injected intravenously into unmanipulated mice.

https://openalex.org/W2035726370,"Repeated cocaine administration increases the dendritic arborization of nucleus accumbens neurons, but the underlying signaling events remain unknown.

Further, we show, using viral-mediated gene transfer, that overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 or local knockout of Rac1 is sufficient to increase the density of immature dendritic spines on nucleus accumbens neurons, whereas overexpression of a constitutively active Rac1 or light activation of a photoactivatable form of Rac1 blocks the ability of repeated cocaine exposure to produce this effect. Downregulation of Rac1 activity likewise promotes behavioral responses to cocaine exposure, with activation of Rac1 producing the opposite effect. These findings establish that Rac1 signaling mediates structural and behavioral plasticity in response to cocaine exposure."

Previous studies have demonstrated that this inefficient process can be facilitated by the inclusion of additional factors. To gain insight into the reprogramming mechanism, we aimed to identify epigenetic enzymes capable of promoting iPSC generation. Here we show that Kdm2b, a histone H3 Lys 36 dimethyl (H3K36me2)-specific demethylase, has the capacity to promote iPSC generation. This capacity depends on its demethylase and DNA-binding activities, but is largely independent of its role in antagonizing senescence. Kdm2b functions at the beginning of the reprogramming process and enhances activation of early responsive genes in reprogramming. Kdm2b contributes to gene activation by binding to and demethylating the gene promoters. Our studies not only identify an important epigenetic factor for iPSC generation, but also reveal the molecular mechanism underlying how Kdm2b contributes to reprogramming. Transcription-factor-directed reprogramming of somatic cells is inefficient but can be enhanced by the addition of enzymes that modulate chromatin modifications. Zhang and colleagues report that the Kdm2b H3K36me2 demethylase promotes reprogramming through its enzymatic activity and independently of its role in senescence, by enhancing the transcription of genes known to be activated early during the process, including cadherin."

https://openalex.org/W2085907949,"Few effective measures exist to combat the worldwide obesity epidemic(1), and the identification of potential therapeutic targets requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that control energy balance. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone that signals the long-term status of bodily energy stores, acts through multiple types of leptin receptor long isoform (LepRb)-expressing neurons (called here LepRb neurons) in the brain to control feeding, energy expenditure and endocrine function(2-4). The modest contributions to energy balance that are attributable to leptin action in many LepRb populations(5-9) suggest that other previously unidentified hypothalamic LepRb neurons have key roles in energy balance. Here we examine the role of LepRb in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1)-expressing LebRb (LepRb(NOS1)) neurons that comprise approximately 20% of the total hypothalamic LepRb neurons. Nos1(cre)-mediated genetic ablation of LepRb (Lepr(Nos1KO)) in mice produces hyperphagic obesity, decreased energy expenditure and hyperglycemia approaching that seen in whole-body LepRb-null mice. In contrast, the endocrine functions in Lepr(Nos1KO) mice are only modestly affected by the genetic ablation of LepRb in these neurons. Thus, hypothalamic LepRb(NOS1) neurons are a key site of action of the leptin-mediated control of systemic energy balance."

Conditional inactivation of three Id genes in NSCs triggered detachment of embryonic and postnatal NSCs from the ventricular and vascular niche, respectively. The interrogation of the gene modules directly targeted by Id deletion in NSCs revealed that Id proteins repress bHLH-mediated activation of Rap1GAP, thus serving to maintain the GTPase activity of RAP1, a key mediator of cell adhesion. Preventing the elevation of the Rap1GAP level countered the consequences of Id loss on NSC-niche interaction and stem-cell identity. Thus, by preserving anchorage of NSCs to the extracellular environment, Id activity synchronizes NSC functions to residency in the specialized niche."

Phosphorylation or SUMOylation of the kainate receptor (KAR) subunit GluK2 have both individually been shown to regulate KAR surface expression. However, it is unknown whether phosphorylation and SUMOylation of GluK2 are important for activity-dependent KAR synaptic plasticity. We found that protein kinase C–mediated phosphorylation of GluK2 at serine 868 promotes GluK2 SUMOylation at lysine 886 and that both of these events are necessary for the internalization of GluK2-containing KARs that occurs during long-term depression of KAR-mediated synaptic transmission at rat hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. Conversely, phosphorylation of GluK2 at serine 868 in the absence of SUMOylation led to an increase in KAR surface expression by facilitating receptor recycling between endosomal compartments and the plasma membrane. Our results suggest a role for the dynamic control of synaptic SUMOylation in the regulation of KAR synaptic transmission and plasticity."

Although factor H is a well known inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, the functions of the CFHR proteins are poorly understood. CFHR4 lacks SCRs homologous to the complement inhibitory domains of factor H and, accordingly, has no significant complement regulatory activities. We have previously shown that CFHR4 binds C-reactive protein via its most N-terminal SCR, which leads to classical complement pathway activation. CFHR4 binds C3b via its C terminus, but the significance of this interaction is unclear. Therefore, we set out to clarify the functional relevance of C3b binding by CFHR4. Here, we report a novel role for CFHR4 in the complement system. CFHR4 serves as a platform for the assembly of an alternative pathway C3 convertase by binding C3b. This is based on the sustained ability of CFHR4-bound C3b to bind factor B and properdin, leading to an active convertase that generates C3a and C3b from C3. The CFHR4-C3bBb convertase is less sensitive to the factor H-mediated decay compared with the C3bBb convertase. CFHR4 mutants containing exchanges of conserved residues within the C-terminal C3b-binding site showed significantly reduced C3b binding and alternative pathway complement activation. In conclusion, our results suggest that, in contrast to the complement inhibitor factor H, CFHR4 acts as an enhancer of opsonization by promoting complement activation."
https://openalex.org/W2011274487,"Bacteria must control their metabolism to quickly adapt to changing carbon sources. PEP carboxylase is now shown to be allosterically regulated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate in an ultrasensitive manner, turning glycolysis on and off almost instantaneously in response to glucose availability. Anapleurosis is the filling of the tricarboxylic acid cycle with four-carbon units. The common substrate for both anapleurosis and glucose phosphorylation in bacteria is the terminal glycolytic metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Here we show that Escherichia coli quickly and almost completely turns off PEP consumption upon glucose removal. The resulting buildup of PEP is used to quickly import glucose if it becomes available again. The switch-like termination of anapleurosis results from depletion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), an ultrasensitive allosteric activator of PEP carboxylase. E. coli expressing an FBP-insensitive point mutant of PEP carboxylase grow normally when glucose is steadily available. However, they fail to build up PEP upon glucose removal, grow poorly when glucose availability oscillates and suffer from futile cycling at the PEP node on gluconeogenic substrates. Thus, bacterial central carbon metabolism is intrinsically programmed with ultrasensitive allosteric regulation to enable rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions."

To further reduce the size of Fc but preserve FcRn binding, we generated three human soluble monomeric IgG1 Fcs (mFcs) by using a combination of structure-based rational protein design combined with multiple screening strategies. These mFcs were highly soluble and retained binding to human FcRn comparable with that of Fc. These results provide direct experimental evidence that efficient binding to human FcRn does not require human Fc dimerization.

https://openalex.org/W2077953899,"In this study, the authors show that TopBP1 is critical for preventing replication-induced DNA damage accumulation in early-born neural progenitors, thereby maintaining genomic integrity in these cells. The rapid proliferation of progenitors during neurogenesis requires a stringent genomic maintenance program to ensure transmission of genetic fidelity. However the essential factors that govern neural progenitor genome integrity are unknown. Here we report that conditional inactivation of mouse TopBP1, a protein linked to DNA replication, and a key activator of the DNA damage response kinase ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related) is critical for maintenance of early-born neural progenitors. During cortical development TopBP1 prevented replication-associated DNA damage in Emx1-progenitors which otherwise resulted in profound tissue ablation. Notably, disrupted neurogenesis in TopBP1-depleted tissues was substantially rescued by inactivation of p53 but not of ATM. Our data establish that TopBP1 is essential for preventing replication-associated DNA strand breaks, but is not essential per se for DNA replication. Thus, TopBP1 is crucial for maintaining genome integrity in the early progenitors that drive neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2138654920,"Action across long distances on chromatin is a hallmark of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation. Although chromatin structure per se can support long-range interactions, the mechanisms of efficient communication between widely spaced DNA modules in chromatin remain a mystery. The molecular simulations described herein suggest that transient binary internucleosomal interactions can mediate distant communication in chromatin. Electrostatic interactions between the N-terminal tails of the core histones and DNA enhance the computed probability of juxtaposition of sites that lie far apart along the DNA sequence. Experimental analysis of the rates of communication in chromatin constructs confirms that long-distance communication occurs efficiently and independently of distance on tail-containing, but not on tailless, chromatin. Taken together, our data suggest that internucleosomal interactions involving the histone tails are essential for highly efficient, long-range communication between regulatory elements and their targets in eukaryotic genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2006594997,"The chloroplast chaperonin system of plants and green algae is a curiosity as both the chaperonin cage and its lid are encoded by multiple genes, in contrast to the single genes encoding the two components of the bacterial and mitochondrial systems. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr), three genes encode chaperonin cofactors, with cpn10 encoding a single ∼10-kDa domain and cpn20 and cpn23 encoding tandem cpn10 domains. Here, we characterized the functional interaction of these proteins with the Escherichia coli chaperonin, GroEL, which normally cooperates with GroES, a heptamer of ∼10-kDa subunits. The C. reinhardtii cofactor proteins alone were all unable to assist GroEL-mediated refolding of bacterial ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase but gained this ability when CrCpn20 and/or CrCpn23 was combined with CrCpn10. Native mass spectrometry indicated the formation of hetero-oligomeric species, consisting of seven ∼10-kDa domains. The cofactor ""heptamers"" interacted with GroEL and encapsulated substrate protein in a nucleotide-dependent manner. Different hetero-oligomer arrangements, generated by constructing cofactor concatamers, indicated a preferential heptamer configuration for the functional CrCpn10-CrCpn23 complex. Formation of heptamer Cpn10/Cpn20 hetero-oligomers was also observed with the Arabidopsis thaliana (At) cofactors, which functioned with the chloroplast chaperonin, AtCpn60α(7)β(7). It appears that hetero-oligomer formation occurs more generally for chloroplast chaperonin cofactors, perhaps adapting the chaperonin system for the folding of specific client proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2127991850,"The protein kinase liver kinase B1 (LKB1) regulates cell polarity and intercellular junction stability. Also, LKB1 controls the activity of salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1). The role and relevance of SIK1 and its downstream effectors in linking the LKB1 signals within these processes are partially understood. We hypothesize that SIK1 may link LKB1 signals to the maintenance of epithelial junction stability by regulating E-cadherin expression. Results from our studies using a mouse lung alveolar epithelial (MLE-12) cell line or human renal proximal tubule (HK2) cell line transiently or stably lacking the expression of SIK1 (using SIK1 siRNAs or shRNAs), or with its expression abrogated (sik1(+/+) vs. sik1(-/-) mice), indicate that suppression of SIK1 (∼40%) increases the expression of the transcriptional repressors Snail2 (∼12-fold), Zeb1 (∼100%), Zeb2 (∼50%), and TWIST (∼20-fold) by activating cAMP-response element binding protein. The lack of SIK1 and activation of transcriptional repressors decreases the availability of E-cadherin (mRNA and protein expression by ∼100 and 80%, respectively) and the stability of intercellular junctions in epithelia (decreases in transepithelial resistance). Furthermore, LKB1-mediated increases in E-cadherin expression are impaired in cells where SIK1 has been disabled. We conclude that SIK1 is a key regulator of E-cadherin expression, and thereby contributes to the stability of intercellular junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2024227449,"Sepsis is a major health problem in the United States with high incidence and elevated patient care cost. Using an animal model of sepsis, cecum ligation, and puncture, we observed that mice became rapidly hypothermic reaching a threshold temperature of 28 °C within 5–10 h after initiation of the insult, resulting in a reliable predictor of mortality, which occurred within 30–72 h of the initial procedure. We also observed that the inflammatory gene expression in lung and liver developed early within 1–2 h of the insult, reaching maximum levels at 6 h, followed by a decline, approaching basal conditions within 20 h. This decrease in inflammatory gene expression at 20 h after cecal ligation and puncture was not due to resolution of the insult but rather was an immune dysfunction stage that was demonstrated by the inability of the animal to respond to a secondary external inflammatory stimulus. Removal of the injury source, ligated cecum, within 6 h of the initial insult resulted in increased survival, but not after 20 h of cecal ligation and puncture.

In addition, the health costs associated with the treatment of septic patients is extremely high at over $16 billion per year (1Angus D.C. Linde-Zwirble W.T. Lidicker J. Clermont G. Carcillo J.

Morbidity and mortality associated with sepsis is often complicated by the development of secondary conditions, including severe sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ failure (3Dellinger R.P.

The current treatment for sepsis and septic shock is mainly supportive. A great deal of effort, time, and money has been directed at potential therapeutic interventions for sepsis without major success. In particular, clinical trials aimed at blocking the inflammatory response have failed (4Hotchkiss R.S. Karl I.E. The pathophysiology and treatment of sepsis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (3211) Google Scholar, 5Remick D.G. Pathophysiology of sepsis.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), which is likely related to the multifactorial nature of this condition, which includes pre-existing conditions, the type of injury or infection, and the inflammatory process triggered by the initial insult (5Remick D.G. Pathophysiology of sepsis.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). These responses are modified by the genetic make-up, sex, and age of the patients (9De Maio A. Torres M.B. Reeves R.H. Genetic determinants influencing the response to injury, inflammation, and sepsis.Shock. 2005; 23: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, the potential therapeutic window for the treatment of sepsis has not been well defined. Finally, there are no sensitive and reliable predictors of sepsis that can be used as an early diagnostic to define the incidence of the condition and the appropriate timing for treatment (4Hotchkiss R.S. Karl I.E. The pathophysiology and treatment of sepsis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (3211) Google Scholar, 5Remick D.G. Pathophysiology of sepsis.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The current dogma indicates that septic shock, which leads to multiple organ failure and death, is the result of an exaggerated or poorly controlled inflammatory response, which has been coined the “cytokine storm” (5Remick D.G. Pathophysiology of sepsis.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 10Murphy T.J. Paterson H.M. Mannick J.A. Lederer J.A. Injury, sepsis, and the regulation of Toll-like receptor responses.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The basic idea is that the proinflammatory response triggered by the initial insult is not effectively counterbalanced by the anti-inflammatory response, resulting in cellular dysfunction, organ failure, and death. Cellular dysfunction may be the product of excessive activation that may directly affect many basic cellular processes or indirectly affect neighboring cells, for example, through the release of toxic agents and oxygen radicals. On the other hand, cell dysfunction may be due to reduced delivery of nutrients and oxygen as a result of capillary constriction (5Remick D.G. Pathophysiology of sepsis.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Increased cell death by apoptosis has also been proposed as a major contributor to organ dysfunction during shock (11Hotchkiss R.S. Nicholson D.W. Apoptosis and caspases regulate death and inflammation in sepsis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Another hypothesis is that death after septic shock is due to immunosuppression or immunoparalysis developed after the initial proinflammatory process. Immunoparalysis ameliorates the capacity of the organism to maintain a “healthy” inflammatory process and properly clear pathogens (12Hotchkiss R.S. Coopersmith C.M. McDunn J.E. Ferguson T.A. The sepsis seesaw. Tilting toward immunosuppression.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 496-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The connection between the initial hyperimmune response and immunosuppression and mortality from septic shock is not clear.

C57BL6/J (B6) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Male B6 mice (8 weeks old) were starved for 16 h before any intervention. CLP was performed as previously described (13Torres M.B. De Maio A. An exaggerated inflammatory response after CLP correlates with a negative outcome.J. Surg. Res. 2005; 125: 88-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Male mice were anesthetized with isoflurane via a vaporizer at 1.5–2.5 minimum alveolar concentration. Under sterile conditions, a 2-cm incision was made in the lower abdominal region, and the cecum was exposed. The distal portion of the cecum was ligated 1.5 cm from the end with a 4–0 silk suture and punctured once with a 16-gauge needle. The cecum was replaced in the peritoneal cavity and squeezed to place a small portion of its content (bacteria and feces) into the peritoneum. Then the peritoneal wall and skin were closed with double sutures. The mice were resuscitated with a subcutaneous injection of sterile saline (1 ml). As a control, mice were sham operated as described above, except that the cecum was neither ligated nor perforated. Nonoperated mice were also used as a second control. After the procedure, the mice had an accessible source of water and food ad libitum. Although we did not quantitate food and water uptake after CLP, we observed a small gain in weight after CLP with respect to the beginning of the experiment, which was no different from sham operated mice. This observation is consistent with published data (19Xiao H. Siddiqui J. Remick D.G. Mechanisms of mortality in early and late sepsis.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 5227-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For cecum excision, mice 3, 6, 8, or 20 h after CLP were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5–2.5 minimum alveolar concentration), the initial incision was opened again under sterile conditions, and the ligated cecum was removed by cutting between two sutures. The peritoneum was rinsed three times with sterile saline, and the peritoneal wall and skin were closed with double sutures. As indicated, the mice were slightly anesthetized with isoflurane and injected with LPS (15 mg/kg) or an equal volume of saline. During the time of the initial surgery, a small thermal probe was placed under the skin during the procedure. The mice were placed in individual cages, and their temperature was continuously recorded using an external receiver (VitalView data acquisition system). These animal protocols have been reviewed and approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Levels of mRNA were measured by quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Tissues were harvested, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The samples were then suspended and homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated. RNA was treated with DNase I (DNA-free kit; Ambion, Austin, TX) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a high capacity reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Newly synthesized cDNA was further diluted and stored at −20 °C. Samples of cDNA were amplified by a 7500 fast real time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) with the following QuantiTect validated primer sets (Qiagen): TNF-α (QT00104006), IL-1β (QT01048355), IL-6 (QT00098875), IL-10 (QT00106169), IFN-β (QT00249662), HMGB1 (QT00247786), CD14 (QT00246190), and TLR4 (QT00259042). Standards corresponding to each target gene were added in each PCR. The results for each sample were normalized by copy number of GAPDH (QT01658692; Qiagen), used as a marker of cDNA inputs. All of the results were expressed as copy numbers of target gene per copy numbers of GAPDH. Myeloperoxidase activity was measured by a modification of method described by (14Stewart D. Fulton W.B. Wilson C. Monitto C.L. Paidas C.N. Reeves R.H. De Maio A. Genetic contribution to the septic response in a mouse model.Shock. 2002; 18: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Samples of liver (150 mg) and the left side of the lung were flushed with PBS and homogenized for 30 s in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. The samples were then subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing, sonication (three times for 10 s for lung and five times for 10 s for liver), and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (25 μl) was mixed with phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing O-dianisidine dihydrochloride (0.167 mg/ml) and hydrogen peroxide (0.0005%), and absorbance at 460 nm was measured immediately at regular intervals (15 s) for 5 min. Protein concentration was measured for each sample by the BCA protein assay, and data (myeloperoxidase activity) were expressed as change in absorbance/min/mg of protein. All of the data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Prism Software, San Diego, CA). Significance was analyzed using one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keul's multiple comparison test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical significance was analyzed by log rank test for comparison of mortality rates. A central objective of this study was to correlate the inflammatory process with the final outcome (mortality) from sepsis induced by CLP. Prior studies have shown that hypothermia is a premorbid condition in experimental sepsis, which can be used as a marker for death after CLP (15Nemzek J.A. Xiao H.Y. Minard A.E. Bolgos G.L. Remick D.G. Humane endpoints in shock research.Shock. 2004; 21: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To monitor core body temperature, a small probe was inserted under the skin of the abdomen at the time of CLP intervention to monitor core body temperature using a telemetric system (VitalView data acquisition system). The continuous readout in body temperature was recorded for each individual animal. C57BL/6J (B6) male mice were subjected to a fulminant variant of the CLP model (1.5-cm cecum ligation, 16-gauge needle single puncture) to study the events associated with the response to sepsis in a relatively short time period. This study was performed in the absence of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, this model reflected the natural response to sepsis with minimal support therapy to establish the base line response. We observed a rapid decline in core body temperature within the first few hours after CLP (a typical temperature profile is presented in Fig. 1A). Based on these observations, we found, with 100% accuracy, that animals that reached a core body temperature of 28 °C died within 72 h of the initial insult. The animals reached the 28 °C threshold core body temperature within 5–10 h after CLP, but mortality was only observed between within 30 and 72 h of the insult. The survival rate at 72 h after CLP was 16.4%, and mice that were predicted to die based on the decrease in core body temperature to 28 °C was 14.6% (Fig. 1B). These observations suggest that reaching a core body temperature threshold of 28 °C is an accurate and early predictor of mortality. These observations were further corroborated using a different mouse strain (A/J), which displayed a different mortality rate after CLP (13Torres M.B. De Maio A. An exaggerated inflammatory response after CLP correlates with a negative outcome.J. Surg. Res. 2005; 125: 88-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Stewart D. Fulton W.B. Wilson C. Monitto C.L. Paidas C.N. Reeves R.H. De Maio A. Genetic contribution to the septic response in a mouse model.Shock. 2002; 18: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A/J mice were subjected to CLP (1.5-cm cecum ligation, 16-gauge needle single puncture), and both core body temperature and mortality were monitored (Fig. 1C). In this case, all of the animals that died displayed a core body temperature below 28 °C, whereas survivals were above 28 °C. Again, the survival rate of actual mortality was 36.8%, and predicted deaths based on reaching 28 °C were 35.9% (Fig. 1D). Finally, we tested a different animal model that also resulted in significant animal death. Mice (B6) were injected with Escherichia coli LPS (15 mg/kg), resulting in 100% mortality. All of the mice displayed a very rapid decrease in core body temperature to below 28 °C within 10 h of injection (Fig. 1E), whereas mortality was observed after several hours (Fig. 1F). Thus, the 28 °C threshold temperature appears to be a reliable early predictor of mortality, well ahead of the actual death. Based on the rapid decrease in core body temperature after CLP, we investigated how early the inflammatory process could be detected following the initial insult. The expression of genes involved in the inflammatory process (i.e. cytokines) was measured at the mRNA level rather than by secreted protein in circulation. This approach is relevant, because it provides a more sensitive read-out of the inflammatory process because the detection limit of qRT-PCR is considerably more sensitive than methods to measure protein, such as ELISA. In addition, this approach allows us to study the kinetic of the inflammatory process after CLP at very early stages of the process when the concentration of cytokines in circulation may be very low. Finally, measuring mRNA levels allows us to study the production of inflammatory molecules in specific organs rather than in circulation, providing more mechanistic information. The expression of four cytokine genes was measured in lung and liver harvested from mice after CLP (1.5-cm cecum ligation, 16-gauge needle single puncture) or sham operation and compared with nonoperated (NO) control mice. We observed a very rapid inflammatory response within the lung, peaking within 2–3 h after CLP for TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10, whereas the peak of IL-6 was observed at 6 h in comparison with NO or sham operated mice (Fig. 2A). Similar observations were made in liver samples in which TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 peaked within 2–3 h and IL-10 after 6 h of CLP in comparison with NO or sham operated mice (Fig. 2B). In both organs, the inflammatory response was followed by a rapid decline in gene expression beginning after 6 h of CLP and reaching basal levels similar to sham operated mice within 20 h of CLP (Fig. 2). Further analysis until 30 h of CLP, which corresponded to a time period very close to the initial mortalities after the insult, revealed that the majority of cytokine expression levels were still suppressed in the liver (Fig. 2B). In the lung, both IL-1β and IL-6 displayed minimal expression levels, whereas the expression of TNF-α was slightly but significantly increased in comparison with sham operated mice. On the contrary, IL-10 expression was dramatically elevated with respect to sham operated animals (Fig. 2A). As another marker of the inflammatory process, we measured the infiltration of PMNL (myeloperoxidase assay) in the lung and liver after CLP. Again, a rapid and significant increase in the infiltration of PMNL in lung was observed within 2–3 h followed by a rapid decline but was still significantly different from sham operated mice after 20 or 30 h of CLP (Fig. 3A). PMNL infiltration in liver was also rapid, reaching maximal levels within 6 h, followed by a decrease that was significantly different from sham operated mice (Fig. 3B). The characterization of the inflammatory process after CLP was further analyzed by measuring the expression of receptors involved in the innate immune response, CD14 and TLR4. The expression of CD14 (mRNA) levels also increased in the lung after CLP, reaching maximum levels within 3–4 h, which was followed by a rapid fall (after 6 h), reaching levels similar to sham operated mice within 20 h, followed by a second increase at 30 h of CLP (Fig. 4A). In the liver, CD14 expression also increased within 4–6 h of CLP, followed by a reduction within 20–30 h of CLP, which was significantly different from sham operated mice (Fig. 4B). In contrast, TLR4 expression was not significantly increased after CLP, and it was similar to sham operated mice (Fig. 4A). All together, these observations suggest that the induction of the inflammatory response by CLP was very rapid and can be divided into two periods: an early hyperinflammatory phase (<6 h) and a hypoinflammatory phase (>20 h), which could be partially modified within 30 h of the insult.FIGURE 4The expression of CD14, but not Tlr4, changed during the time course of CLP. Male B6 mice (n = 50) were subjected to CLP, 1.5-cm cecum ligation and 16-gauge needle perforation (closed squares), or sham operation (open squares). At different time points after CLP (n = 5) or sham operation (n = 5), the mice were sacrificed, lung (A) and liver (B) were harvested, and total RNA was isolated. Levels of mRNA for CD14 or Tlr4 were measured by qRT-PCR. The mRNA levels were established by comparison with a standard curve and expressed as a copy number. The values were normalized to GADPH mRNA levels. Statistical analysis for the time course of CLP was performed by one-way ANOVA, and comparison between CLP and sham operation was measured by two-way ANOVA. *, p < 0.05 CLP versus sham operated at each time point. Notice that cytokine gene expression is observed very rapidly after CLP in both organs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the inflammatory phases observed and the rapid decline in core body temperature after CLP, we were interested in defining how they related to the possible therapeutic window after CLP. We thought that removal of the ligated/perforated cecum, which is the source of infection and injury, was probably the most dramatic intervention to resolve sepsis. Previous studies have shown that, indeed, cecum excision improved survival after CLP (16Baker C.C. Chaudry I.H. Gaines H.O. Baue A.E.

Remick D.G. Mechanisms of mortality in early and late sepsis.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 5227-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We excised the ligated cecum at 3 or 20 h after CLP, because these time points represent the two different inflammatory phases observed after the insult. The mice were subjected to CLP, and then they were randomized into three groups at 3 h or 20 h after CLP. In one group, the ligated cecum was removed (CLP + cecum removal). The second group was subjected to sham operation (CLP + sham). The third group was not operated a second time (CLP + NO). Removal of the ligated cecum at 3 h after CLP showed a statistically significant improvement of the survival rate in comparison with animals in which the cecum was not removed but were sham operated or nonoperated a second time (Fig. 5A). In contrast, excision of the cecum at 20 h after CLP did not improve the survival rate (Fig. 5B). Subsequent experiments in which the cecum was removed at 6 or 8 h after CLP showed 80 and 30% survival rates, respectively (Fig. 5C). Based on these observations, we defined two distinct phases of sepsis: therapeutically reversible (< 6 h) and therapeutically irreversible (> 20 h), which coincide with the two inflammatory stages observed above. The therapeutically irreversible phase of sepsis corresponds to a condition in which the inflammatory response is already reduced with respect to the early hyperinflammatory and therapeutically reversible phase. This condition may resemble a stage of immunosuppression or immunoparalysis, which has been previously described during sepsis (12Hotchkiss R.S. Coopersmith C.M. McDunn J.E. Ferguson T.A. The sepsis seesaw. Tilting toward immunosuppression.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 496-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to investigate this possible immunosuppressive stage by using a functional assay. We evaluated the response to LPS, which induces a strong inflammatory response, at a late stage of sepsis (20 h after CLP), in which mortalities were still not observed. The mice were subjected to CLP, sham operation (SO), or NO. These animals were challenged with LPS (15 mg/kg) at 20 h after the initial procedure, and cytokine levels (qRT-PCR) in lungs and liver were measured 2 h after LPS injection. As a negative control, a group of mice that were neither subjected to CLP nor injected with LPS were included. We observed that TNF-α and IFN-β mRNA levels were induced after LPS injection in mice that were initially NO or SO in comparison with mice that were not injected with LPS. In contrast, LPS-induced TNF-α and IFN-β mRNA levels in both lung and liver samples were significantly reduced in mice that were subjected to CLP first in comparison with SO or NO after LPS injection (Fig. 6). LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA levels were highly increased in lung of mice that were CLP pretreated in comparison with mice that were SO or NO (Fig. 6A). No statistical differences were observed in IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA levels in liver after LPS injection between animals that were initially subjected to CLP, SO, or NO (Fig. 6B). The expression of a late sepsis marker, HMGB1, was also evaluated. Significant increases in HMGB1 mRNA levels were observed in all animals injected with LPS regardless of whether or not they were initially subjected to CLP, sham operation, or not operated at all in comparison with the absence of LPS injection (Fig. 6). These observations suggest that the innate immune response is partially compromised during the irreversible phase of sepsis (> 20 h after CLP). Trauma/injury is the third overall cause of mortality in the United States, surpassed only by cardiovascular disease and cancer. Moreover, it is the main killer in people under 40 years of age. One of the consequences of trauma/injury is the incidence of sepsis, which is often followed by the development of septic shock, multiple organ failure, and death (2Martin G.S. Mannino D.M. Eaton S.

https://openalex.org/W2085242117,"Conantokins are short peptides derived from the venoms of marine cone snails that act as antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor family of excitatory glutamate receptors. These peptides contain γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues typically spaced at i,i+4 and/or i,i+7 intervals, which by chelating divalent cations induce and stabilize helical conformation of the peptide. Introduction of a dicarba bridge (or a staple) can covalently stabilize peptide helicity and improve its pharmacological properties. To test the hypothesis that stapling can effectively replace γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues in stabilizing the helical conformation of conantokins, we designed, synthesized, and characterized several stapled analogs of conantokin G (conG), with varying connectivities in terms of staple length and location along the face of the α-helix. NMR studies confirmed that the ring-closing metathesis reaction yielded a single product with the Z configuration of the olefinic bond. Based on circular dichroism and molecular modeling, the stapled analogs exhibited significantly enhanced helicity compared with the native peptide in a metal-free environment. Stapling i,i+4 was benign with respect to effects on in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties. One analog, namely conG[11-15,S(i,i+4)S(8)], blocked NR2B-containing NMDA receptors with IC(50) = 0.7 μm and provided significant protection in the 6-Hz psychomotor model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy in mice. Remarkably, unlike native conG, conG[11-15,S(i,i+4)S(8)] produced no behavioral motor toxicity. Our results extend the applications of peptide stapling to helical peptides with extracellular targets and provide a means for engineering conantokins with improved pharmacological properties."
https://openalex.org/W1995889427,"The Rho family of small GTPases are membrane-associated molecular switches involved in the control of a wide range of cellular activities, including cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (CdGAP) is a phosphoprotein showing GAP activity toward Rac1 and Cdc42. CdGAP activity is regulated in an adhesion-dependent manner and more recently, we have identified CdGAP as a novel molecular target in signaling and an essential component in the synergistic interaction between TGFβ and Neu/ErbB-2 signaling pathways in breast cancer cells. In this study, we identified a small polybasic region (PBR) preceding the RhoGAP domain that mediates specific binding to negatively charged phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). In vitro reconstitution of membrane vesicles loaded with prenylated Rac1 demonstrates that the PBR is required for full activation of CdGAP in the presence of PI(3,4,5)P3. In fibroblast cells, the expression of CdGAP protein mutants lacking an intact PBR shows a significant reduced ability of the protein mutants to induce cell rounding or to mediate negative effects on cell spreading. Furthermore, an intact PBR is required for CdGAP to inactivate Rac1 signaling into cells, whereas it is not essential in an in vitro context. Altogether, these studies reveal that specific interaction between negatively charged phospholipid PI(3,4,5)P3 and the stretch of polybasic residues preceding the RhoGAP domain regulates CdGAP activity in vivo and is required for its cellular functions."

Thus, we found that Streptococcus uberis Pg activator (SUPA), isolated from a Streptococcus species that infects cows but not humans, robustly activated bovine but not human Pg in purified systems and in plasma. Consistent with this, SUPA formed a higher avidity complex (118-fold) with bovine Pg than with human Pg and non-proteolytically activated bovine but not human Pg. Surprisingly, however, the presence of human fibrin overrides the species-restricted action of SUPA. First, human fibrin enhanced the binding avidity of SUPA for human Pg by 4–8-fold in the presence and absence of chloride ion (a negative regulator). Second, although SUPA did not protect plasmin from inactivation by α2-antiplasmin, fibrin did protect human plasmin, which formed a 31-fold higher avidity complex with SUPA than Pg. Third, fibrin significantly enhanced Pg activation by reducing the Km (4-fold) and improving the catalytic efficiency of the SUPA complex (6-fold).

Both mammals and bacteria produce Pg activators, but they are markedly different in structure and mechanisms of action. The mammalian Pg activators, tissue Pg activator and urinary-type Pg activator, are serine proteases that directly cleave a broad spectrum of Pgs from different animal species (2Bode W. Renatus M.

Briefly, 400 nm Pg or micro-Pg was added to a microplate well containing 1 μm 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate in filtered HEPES assay buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) at 25 °C. After 10 min, SK or SUPA (200–800 nm) or buffer alone (control) was added to test wells. In certain runs, a complex of Pg and Pg activator, which was preformed on ice by mixing both proteins for 10–20 min, was added directly to the assay buffer. The development of fluorescence was monitored continuously with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. The fluorescence increase was used to calculate the active site generation using 4-methylumbelliferone as a control. SUPA and Pg or plasmin binding assays were performed in microtiter plates coated with 100 nm SUPA for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were washed, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. After that, varying concentrations of Pg or aprotinin-inactivated plasmin were added for 1 h. After washing, mouse anti-plasmin(ogen) monoclonal antibody was added for 1 h, followed by washing and the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. The bound antibody was detected by 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate, and the reaction was monitored at A370 nm within the dynamic range of the microplate reader. Binding constants were calculated using GraphPad Prism software. The activation of human Glu-Pg/bovine Pg/human micro-Pg by various amounts of Pg activator (SK, SUPA, and staphylokinase) was examined at 37 °C in either HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES with or without 150 mm NaOAc or NaCl, pH 7.4) or Tris/NaCl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Pgs were pretreated with aprotinin-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C to remove contaminating plasmin. Pg was added to the assay buffer in the presence of 500 μm S-2251 (Chromogenix-Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, MA) (19Friberger P. Knös M. Gustavsson S. Aurell L. Claeson G. Methods for determination of plasmin, antiplasmin, and plasminogen by means of substrate S-2251.Haemostasis. 1978; 7: 138-145PubMed Google Scholar), followed by Pg activator (final volume of 100 μl). The change in absorbance at 405 nm was continuously recorded in a Thermomax microtiter plate reader. To examine the effect of fibrinogen or CNBr-fibrin fragments on Pg activation, Pg was preincubated with each reagent in the assay buffer for 10 min before the addition of Pg activator. Pg activation parameters were calculated using amidolytic parameters for plasmin as described by Wohl et al. (20Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C.

Human or bovine plasma fibrinogenolysis was determined by incubating 180 μl of plasma with 20 μl assay buffer containing varying concentrations of SUPA or no SUPA (control) at 37 °C. Samples were collected after 2 h and mixed with 200 kallikrein inhibitor units of aprotinin/ml of plasma to quench plasmin-mediated lysis. Residual fibrinogen concentrations were determined by the sodium sulfite method (21Rampling M.W. Gaffney P.J. The sulfite precipitation method for fibrinogen measurement: its use on small samples in the presence of fibrinogen degradation products.Clin. Chim. Acta. 1976; 67: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Human or bovine plasma fibrinolysis was determined by simultaneous mixing 180 μl of plasma with various amounts of SUPA in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, 1 IU/ml thrombin, and trace amounts of 125I-fibrinogen (final volume of 200 μl). The total radioactivity of the sample was monitored using a Cobra II γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After incubation of the samples at 37 °C for 2 h, 200 kallikrein inhibitor units of aprotinin was added to each milliliter of plasma clot to inhibit further lysis. The radioactivity of the clot and supernatant plasma was monitored separately. The percentage of fibrinolysis was defined as the difference between the initial and residual clot radioactivity divided by the initial clot radioactivity. The generation of plasmin by SUPA was detected using SDS-PAGE assay under denaturing conditions. The effect of SUPA or SK on the inhibition of plasmin by α2-antiplasmin was examined. Plasmin (0.25 μm) was mixed with varying concentrations of SK or SUPA (0.25–2.5 μm) in HEPES/NaOAc buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 20 min, followed by the addition of 0.25 μm α2-antiplasmin. After 10 min, samples were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against α2-antiplasmin (RWR) (22Reed 3rd, G.L. Matsueda G.R. Haber E. Synergistic fibrinolysis: combined effects of plasminogen activators and an antibody that inhibits α2-antiplasmin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To confirm that SUPA is restricted in its ability to activate different mammalian Pgs, we examined its action on human and bovine Pgs. SUPA rapidly and efficiently activated purified bovine Pg (Fig. 1A) but did not efficiently activate purified human Pg (Fig. 1B). In contrast, as a control, SK had no activity against bovine Pg (Fig. 1A), but it rapidly and efficiently activated human Pg (Fig. 1B). Pg activation with purified reagents in vitro is quite different from Pg activation in complex biologic solutions such as plasma and serum that contain molecules (e.g. fibrinogen, fibrin, α2-antiplasmin, etc.) that modify the activity of both Pg and plasmin. In plasma or serum, the plasmin generated by Pg activators degrades target substrates such as fibrinogen and fibrin. When SUPA was added to bovine plasma (Fig. 2A), it triggered the degradation of fibrinogen in a potent dose-related process with an EC50 of 185 nm. In a similar fashion, when added to bovine serum containing fibrin clots, there was a potent degradation of fibrin with a comparable EC50 of 153 nm. When SUPA was added to human plasma (Fig. 2B), it triggered fibrinogen degradation with a potency that was markedly lower (estimated EC50 of ∼1000 nm) than in bovine plasma. In contrast, when SUPA was added to human serum containing fibrin, it initiated fibrin degradation with a similar potency (EC50 = 154 nm) as that seen in bovine plasma and serum. These results indicate that fibrin and, to a much lesser extent, fibrinogen significantly alter the SUPA species-restricted mechanism of human Pg activation. Pg activation and subsequent degradation of fibrinogen and fibrin by SUPA require the initial formation of SUPA-Pg complexes. Consistent with this notion, in the presence of physiologic levels of chloride ion, bovine Pg bound well to SUPA (KD = 6.9 ± 0.5 nm). However, the relative binding avidity of SUPA for human Pg was 118-fold less (KD = 811 ± 356 nm) in the same chloride-containing buffer (Table 1). Chloride ion is known to regulate the conformation of Pg and its interactions with other molecules. Indeed, in the absence of chloride ion, there was enhanced binding (4-fold, KD = 194 ± 22 nm) of SUPA to human Pg. In the presence of chloride ion, SUPA binding was also enhanced by fibrin (8-fold, KD = 99 ± 50 nm).TABLE 1Binding constants for SUPA-Pg or SUPA-plasmin complexesKD+Chloride (150 mm)−Chloride+Chloride + fibrin (0.1 mg/ml)×10−9 mSUPA-human Pg811 ± 356194 ± 2299 ± 50SUPA-human plasmin26 ± 433 ± 326 ± 1 Open table in a new tab By comparison with human Pg, human plasmin bound with greater avidity to SUPA. In the presence of chloride ion, the KD for SUPA-plasmin binding was 31-fold lower (KD = 26 ± 4 nm) (Table 1). In contrast to Pg, the binding of human plasmin was minimally affected, if at all, by the absence of chloride ion (KD = 33 ± 3 nm) or the presence of fibrin (KD = 26 ± 1 nm). After formation, the SUPA-activator complex interacts with Pg substrate to catalyze the production of plasmin. In fluids containing physiologic concentrations of chloride ion, human Glu-Pg adopts a folded conformation that protects it from activation (24Chibber B.A. Castellino F.J.

Streptokinase binds preferentially to the extended conformation of plasminogen through lysine-binding site and catalytic domain interactions.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13974-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fibrin opposes the effects of chloride ion and unfolds the Glu-Pg substrate, which may modulate the ability of the SUPA-activator complex to activate human Glu-Pg substrate (26Bok R.A. Mangel W.F.

Although chloride did not significantly affect the formation of the SUPA-plasmin activator complex (see below and Table 1), increasing chloride concentrations inhibited SUPA-induced Pg activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In the presence of chloride ion, fibrinogen modestly enhanced Pg activation by SUPA compared with BSA alone (as a nonspecific protein control) (Fig. 3C). However, Pg activation by SUPA (Fig. 3C) was enhanced more markedly by cyanogen bromide-digested fibrin fragments, a widely used soluble form of fibrin (28Lee P.P. Wohl R.C. Boreisha I.G.

Direct analysis of these reactions by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4) confirmed that fibrin fragments enhanced human Pg activation by SUPA compared with Pg activation in the absence of fibrin. Kinetic analysis of Pg activation by SUPA in HEPES buffer containing 150 mm chloride ion indicated that the presence of 0.1 mg/ml CNBr-fibrin decreased KPg by 4.2-fold, increased kPg by 1.4-fold, and enhanced the catalytic efficiency (kPg/KPg) by 6.1-fold (Table 2).FIGURE 4Analysis of human Glu-Pg activation by SUPA in presence of fibrin.

In a similar fashion, SUPA can non-proteolytically activate bovine Pg (10Sazonova I.Y. Houng A.K. Chowdhry S.A. Robinson B.R. Hedstrom L. Reed G.L.

Complex interactions between bovine plasminogen and streptococcal plasminogen activator PauA.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because plasmin is a trace contaminant of Pg preparations, we examined whether SUPA can non-proteolytically activate human Pg using micro-Pg(R561A); this contains an activation loop mutation of Arg561 to alanine that prevents it from forming plasmin (16Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Deletion of Ile1 changes the mechanism of streptokinase: evidence for the molecular sexuality hypothesis.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Zymogen activation in the streptokinase-plasminogen complex. Ile1 is required for the formation of a functional active site.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consistent with its ability to non-proteolytically activate Pg, SK generated active complexes with both micro-Pg and mutant micro-Pg(R561A) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, staphylokinase, which cannot non-proteolytically activate human Pg, activated micro-Pg but not micro-Pg(R561A) (Fig. 5B). Similar to staphylokinase, SUPA activated micro-Pg but not micro-Pg(R561A) (Fig. 5C). These observations confirm that human Pg activation by staphylokinase or SUPA requires the presence of microplasmin, which is a trace contaminant of micro-Pg but not micro-Pg(R561A) (16Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Deletion of Ile1 changes the mechanism of streptokinase: evidence for the molecular sexuality hypothesis.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Wang S.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, SUPA appears to activate human Pg in plasma through a mechanism akin to staphylokinase: by forming an activator complex with plasmin. By forming covalent plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complexes, α2-antiplasmin rapidly inactivates plasmin in plasma. The binding of plasmin to fibrin partially protects from inactivation by α2-antiplasmin (30Kolev K. Léránt I. Tenekejiev K. Machovich R. Regulation of fibrinolytic activity of neutrophil leukocyte elastase, plasmin, and miniplasmin by plasma protease inhibitors.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17030-17034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Schneider M. Nesheim M. A study of the protection of plasmin from antiplasmin inhibition within an intact fibrin clot during the course of clot lysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13333-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, as expected, when mixed with plasmin, α2-antiplasmin formed inactive plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complexes (Fig. 6). SK protected against the formation of inactive human plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complexes. However, SUPA did not prevent the formation of human plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complexes (Fig. 6). Thus, in contrast to its interactions with bovine plasmin, SUPA is unable to protect human plasmin from inactivation by α2-antiplasmin. The restricted ability of bacterial Pg activators to activate different mammalian Pgs has long been considered a fundamental distinction between mammalian and bacterial Pg activators (6Gladysheva I.P. Turner R.B. Sazonova I.Y. Liu L. Reed G.L. Coevolutionary patterns in plasminogen activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9168-9172Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, in plasma or in purified systems with physiologic concentrations of chloride, SUPA efficiently activates bovine but not human Pg. However, in the presence of fibrin, SUPA acquires the ability to efficiently activate human Pg. This fibrin-targeted activity of SUPA with human Pg is the result of several different mechanisms. First, fibrin modifies the avidity of binding interactions between SUPA and human Pg. In plasma and fluids that contain physiologic concentrations of chloride ion (e.g. ∼120–150 mm), the binding interactions between SUPA and human Pg are of much lower avidity (118-fold higher KD) than the binding interactions between SUPA and bovine Pg. Fibrin significantly enhances the binding interactions between SUPA and human Pg (8-fold lower KD), as does the absence of chloride ion (4-fold lower KD). Fibrin has a minimal effect on the binding interactions between SUPA and human plasmin, which are already of much higher avidity (31-fold lower KD) than the binding interactions with human Pg. Second, fibrin provides a protective environment for the existence of plasmin, which permits the formation of the SUPA-plasmin complex. This is critical because SUPA cannot non-proteolytically activate human Pg as it does bovine Pg. Similar to staphylokinase, SUPA does not protect human plasmin from inhibition by α2-antiplasmin; fibrin does (30Kolev K. Léránt I. Tenekejiev K. Machovich R. Regulation of fibrinolytic activity of neutrophil leukocyte elastase, plasmin, and miniplasmin by plasma protease inhibitors.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17030-17034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Schneider M. Nesheim M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 13333-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This effectively limits Pg activation by the SUPA-plasmin complex to the fibrin surface, where it is partially protected from inhibitors. Third, fibrin enhances the catalytic efficiency of the SUPA-plasmin complex with human Pg substrate by 6-fold. Because fibrin does not significantly affect the formation of the SUPA-plasmin complex (Table 1), this enhanced catalytic efficiency is likely to reflect the known effects of fibrin on unfolding the Pg substrate conformation (26Bok R.A. Mangel W.F. Quantitative characterization of the binding of plasminogen to intact fibrin clots, lysine-Sepharose, and fibrin cleaved by plasmin.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3279-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Christensen U. Mølgaard L. Positive cooperative binding at two weak lysine-binding sites governs the Glu-plasminogen conformational change.Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, the negative effects of chloride ion on the catalytic efficiency of the SUPA-plasmin complex may well be attributed to the effect that chloride ion has on promoting a folded, less readily activated Pg substrate. Species-restricted activation of Pg by bacterial Pg activators has been noted for decades, but the mechanisms responsible for it are still poorly understood. This species restriction occurs despite homology between Pgs from different species and between different SK-like bacterial Pg activators. For example, the α- and β-domains of SUPA show considerable sequence identity (30.9 and 27.4%, respectively) and structural similarity to SK and significant but less sequence identity (11.9 and 15.6%, respectively) and structural similarity to staphylokinase (10Sazonova I.Y.

Species restriction also occurs despite evidence of binding interactions between different SK-like molecules and Pgs from different species (13Gladysheva I.P. Sazonova I.Y. Chowdhry S.A. Liu L.

Chem. 2010; 285: 21153-21164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One key determinant of species restriction is the requirement of intermolecular complementarity at sites necessary for function (6Gladysheva I.P. Turner R.B. Sazonova I.Y. Liu L. Reed G.L. Coevolutionary patterns in plasminogen activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9168-9172Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human plasmin complexed with streptokinase.Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Alteration of key loop residues in human Pg makes it susceptible to activation by SUPA (6Gladysheva I.P. Turner R.B. Sazonova I.Y. Liu L. Reed G.L. Coevolutionary patterns in plasminogen activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9168-9172Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In a complementary fashion, replacing the SK β-domain with the SUPA β-domain creates an SK chimera that activates horse Pg, a non-cognate substrate of native SK (6Gladysheva I.P. Turner R.B. Sazonova I.Y. Liu L. Reed G.L. Coevolutionary patterns in plasminogen activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9168-9172Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Still, it has not been appreciated that Pg-interacting molecules may also regulate species-specific Pg activation by altering the interactions, conformation, etc., of Pg. In this study, we have shown that human fibrin, which binds and alters the conformation of Pg, improves the substrate binding and processing of human Pg by SUPA. The Pg-plasmin system has been exploited by bacteria to facilitate infection (6Gladysheva I.P. Turner R.B. Sazonova I.Y. Liu L. Reed G.L. Coevolutionary patterns in plasminogen activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9168-9172Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For example, group A streptococci producing SK (which does not activate mouse Pg) cannot infect normal mice, but they can infect mice carrying a transgene for human Pg (33Sun H. Ringdahl U. Homeister J.W. Fay W.P. Engleberg N.C. Yang A.Y. Rozek L.S. Wang X. Sjöbring U. Ginsburg D. Plasminogen is a critical host pathogenicity factor for group A streptococcal infection.Science. 2004; 305: 1283-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, vaccines generated against SUPA (PauA) have been shown to reduce infection by S. uberis (34Leigh J.A. Finch J.M. Field T.R. Real N.C. Winter A. Walton A.W. Hodgkinson S.M. Vaccination with the plasminogen activator from Streptococcus uberis induces an inhibitory response and protects against experimental infection in the dairy cow.Vaccine. 1999; 17: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both Pg and fibrinogen are key modulators of the pathogenesis and inflammatory response to bacteria producing Pg activators such as Yersinia pestis (35Sifringer M. Stefovska V. Zentner I. Hansen B. Stepulak A. Knaute C. Marzahn J. Ikonomidou C. The role of matrix metalloproteinases in infant traumatic brain injury.Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 25: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The action of bacterial Pg activators on the host Pg system can degrade the extracellular matrix to facilitate the spread and invasion of bacteria (36Lähteenmäki K. Edelman S. Korhonen T.K. Bacterial metastasis: the host plasminogen system in bacterial invasion.Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition to Pg activators, bacteria also produce plasmin-binding molecules that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of infection because 1) they protect plasmin from inhibition by serpins like α2-antiplasmin (37Boyle M.D. Lottenberg R. Plasminogen activation by invasive human pathogens.Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and 2) they modify the activity of the Pg activator complexes. It has also recently been shown that bacteria that lack intrinsic fibrinolytic activity produce a molecule (Skizzle) that can enhance Pg activation by either urinary-type or tissue-type Pg activator (32Wiles K.G. Panizzi P. Kroh H.K. Bock P.E. Skizzle is a novel plasminogen- and plasmin-binding protein from Streptococcus agalactiae that targets proteins of human fibrinolysis to promote plasmin generation.J.

Our results suggest that a number of different bacterial Pg activators, once thought to be specific for cognate mammalian Pgs, can be induced to become activators of human Pg. Further insights into the mechanisms of action of Pg activators may result in new therapeutic agents targeted to human clots as well as novel approaches for ablating the contribution of bacterial Pg activators to the pathogenesis of infections.
