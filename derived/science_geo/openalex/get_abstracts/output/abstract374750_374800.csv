https://openalex.org/W2012986985,"Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the most important crop plants for seed protein and oil content, and for its capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbioses with soil-borne microorganisms. We sequenced the 1.1-gigabase genome by a whole-genome shotgun approach and integrated it with physical and high-density genetic maps to create a chromosome-scale draft sequence assembly. We predict 46,430 protein-coding genes, 70% more than Arabidopsis and similar to the poplar genome which, like soybean, is an ancient polyploid (palaeopolyploid). About 78% of the predicted genes occur in chromosome ends, which comprise less than one-half of the genome but account for nearly all of the genetic recombination. Genome duplications occurred at approximately 59 and 13 million years ago, resulting in a highly duplicated genome with nearly 75% of the genes present in multiple copies. The two duplication events were followed by gene diversification and loss, and numerous chromosome rearrangements. An accurate soybean genome sequence will facilitate the identification of the genetic basis of many soybean traits, and accelerate the creation of improved soybean varieties. Soybean (Glycine max) is an important commercial crop providing both protein and oil, and its symbiotic relationship to nitrogen-fixing bacteria makes it a profitable crop in rotation systems. Its genome has now been sequenced: it is the first legume and at 1.1 gigabases, the largest plant genome to be sequenced by whole-genome shotgun techniques. Soybean has a colourful genetic past; genome duplications occurred at 59 and 13 million years ago, resulting in a highly duplicated genome with nearly 75% of the genes present in multiple copies.

https://openalex.org/W2109909801,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission provides an experimental model for studying mechanisms of memory. The classical form of LTP relies on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), and it has been shown that astroglia can regulate their activation through Ca(2+)-dependent release of the NMDAR co-agonist D-serine. Release of D-serine from glia enables LTP in cultures and explains a correlation between glial coverage of synapses and LTP in the supraoptic nucleus. However, increases in Ca(2+) concentration in astroglia can also release other signalling molecules, most prominently glutamate, ATP and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, whereas neurons themselves can synthesize and supply D-serine. Furthermore, loading an astrocyte with exogenous Ca(2+) buffers does not suppress LTP in hippocampal area CA1 (refs 14-16), and the physiological relevance of experiments in cultures or strong exogenous stimuli applied to astrocytes has been questioned. The involvement of glia in LTP induction therefore remains controversial. Here we show that clamping internal Ca(2+) in individual CA1 astrocytes blocks LTP induction at nearby excitatory synapses by decreasing the occupancy of the NMDAR co-agonist sites. This LTP blockade can be reversed by exogenous D-serine or glycine, whereas depletion of D-serine or disruption of exocytosis in an individual astrocyte blocks local LTP. We therefore demonstrate that Ca(2+)-dependent release of D-serine from an astrocyte controls NMDAR-dependent plasticity in many thousands of excitatory synapses nearby."

One challenge in these reactions is the low rate of formation of reactive atomic surface oxygen. Wittstock et al. (p. 319 ; see the Perspective by Christensen and Nørskov ) created high–surface area gold catalysts by leaching silver from gold-silver alloys. This material proved to be an effective catalyst for partial oxidative coupling of methanol, yielding methyl formate. Residual silver appears to play a key role in activating the dissociation of molecular oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1545762935,"For almost two decades the properties of ""dwarf"" galaxies have challenged the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm of galaxy formation. Most observed dwarf galaxies consists of a rotating stellar disc embedded in a massive DM halo with a near constant-density core. Yet, models based on the CDM scenario invariably form galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar ""bulges"" and steep central DM profiles, as low angular momentum baryons and DM sink to the center of galaxies through accretion and repeated mergers. Processes that decrease the central density of CDM halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theory with observations of present day dwarfs. This failure is potentially catastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different DM particle candidate. This Letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda$CDM framework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallow central DM profile, are formed. This is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneous interstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosions which remove low angular momentum gas. This inhibits the formation of bulges and decreases the dark-matter density to less than half within the central kiloparsec. Realistic dwarf galaxies are thus shown to be a natural outcome of galaxy formation in the CDM scenario."
https://openalex.org/W2127624416,"Tumor cells display progressive changes in metabolism that correlate with malignancy, including development of a lipogenic phenotype. How stored fats are liberated and remodeled to support cancer pathogenesis, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is highly expressed in aggressive human cancer cells and primary tumors, where it regulates a fatty acid network enriched in oncogenic signaling lipids that promotes migration, invasion, survival, and in vivo tumor growth. Overexpression of MAGL in nonaggressive cancer cells recapitulates this fatty acid network and increases their pathogenicity-phenotypes that are reversed by an MAGL inhibitor. Impairments in MAGL-dependent tumor growth are rescued by a high-fat diet, indicating that exogenous sources of fatty acids can contribute to malignancy in cancers lacking MAGL activity. Together, these findings reveal how cancer cells can co-opt a lipolytic enzyme to translate their lipogenic state into an array of protumorigenic signals. PAPERFLICK:"
https://openalex.org/W2152105724,"Plants are highly sensitive to temperature and can perceive a difference of as little as 1 degrees C. How temperature is sensed and integrated in development is unknown. In a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis, we have found that nucleosomes containing the alternative histone H2A.Z are essential to perceiving ambient temperature correctly. Genotypes deficient in incorporating H2A.Z into nucleosomes phenocopy warm grown plants, and show a striking constitutive warm temperature transcriptome. We show that nucleosomes containing H2A.Z display distinct responses to temperature in vivo, independently of transcription. Using purified nucleosomes, we are able to show that H2A.Z confers distinct DNA-unwrapping properties on nucleosomes, indicating a direct mechanism for the perception of temperature through DNA-nucleosome fluctuations. Our results show that H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes provide thermosensory information that is used to coordinate the ambient temperature transcriptome. We observe the same effect in budding yeast, indicating that this is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2105728643,"Behavioral Profiling The complexity of the brain makes it difficult to predict how a drug will affect behavior without direct testing in live animals. Rihel et al. (p. 348 ) developed a high-throughput assay to assess the effects of thousands of drugs on sleep/wake behaviors of zebrafish larvae. The data set reveals a broad conservation of zebrafish and mammalian sleep/wake pharmacology and identifies pathways that regulate sleep. Moreover, the biological targets of poorly characterized small molecules can be predicted by matching their behavioral profiles to those of well-known drugs. Thus, behavioral profiling in zebrafish offers a cost-effective way to characterize neuroactive drugs and to predict biological targets of novel compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2068383276,"Alzheimer disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposition into cerebral amyloid plaques.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides have a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease and represent the core components of the senile plaques, the lesions invariably found in the neocortex and hippocampus of the AD brains (1.Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar, 2.Wilquet V. De Strooper B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) is sequentially cleaved by the aspartic protease β-secretase/BACE1 and by the γ-secretase proteolytic complex to produce various Aβ peptides, including the most abundant isoforms Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 (3.Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 4.Marambaud P. Robakis N.K. Genes Brain Behav. 2005; 4: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Epidemiological data suggest that moderate consumption of red wine is associated with a lower incidence of dementia and AD (5.Luchsinger J.A. Mayeux R. Lancet Neurol. 2004; 3: 579-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The naturally occurring polyphenol resveratrol (trans-3,4′,5-trihydroxystilbene), which is found in abundance in red wine, has antioxidant and neuroprotective properties in vitro and could explain, in part, the beneficial effects of wine consumption in AD (6.Ramassamy C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 545: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 7.Vingtdeux V. Dreses-Werringloer U. Zhao H. Davies P. Marambaud P. BMC Neurosci. 2008; 9: S6Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Importantly, resveratrol controls Aβ levels by facilitating its proteolytic clearance in cultured cell lines (8.Marambaud P. Zhao H. Davies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37377-37382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanism by which resveratrol controls Aβ metabolism is currently unknown. Furthermore, evidence is missing to support the notion that orally administered resveratrol is bioavailable and bioactive in the brain.A growing body of literature has demonstrated the beneficial effect of resveratrol on age-related metabolic deterioration and its protective role in metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Resveratrol mimics caloric restriction by extending the lifespan of different small organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans (9.Baur J.A. Sinclair D.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar, 10.Greer E.L. Brunet A. Aging Cell. 2009; 8: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and by delaying several aging phenotypes in mice (11.Pearson K.J. Baur J.A. Lewis K.N. Peshkin L. Price N.L. Labinskyy N. Swindell W.R. Kamara D. Minor R.K. Perez E. Jamieson H.A. Zhang Y. Dunn S.R. Sharma K. Pleshko N. Woollett L.A. Csiszar A. Ikeno Y. Le Couteur D. Elliott P.J. Becker K.G. Navas P. Ingram D.K. Wolf N.S. Ungvari Z. Sinclair D.A. de Cabo R. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Resveratrol also appears to be protective against the deregulation of energy homeostasis observed in mouse models for metabolic syndromes via the activation of key metabolic sensor proteins, such as the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the deacetylase from the sirtuin family SIRT1 (12.Cantó C. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2009; 20: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 13.Um, J. H., Park, S. J., Kang, H., Yang, S., Foretz, M., McBurney, M. W., Kim, M. K., Viollet, B., Chung, J. H. (2009) Diabetes, in pressGoogle Scholar).AMPK is a Ser/Thr protein kinase formed by a heterotrimeric complex comprising a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits. AMPK is activated by different upstream kinases via phosphorylation within its activation loop at Thr-172 (14.Carling D. Sanders M.J. Woods A. Int. J. Obes. 2008; 32: S55-S59Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15.Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). The main AMPK-activating kinase is LKB1, a protein expressed ubiquitously and recruited for AMPK phosphorylation after an elevation of the AMP/ATP ratio. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β (CaMKKβ), a kinase with a more restricted expression in neural tissue, also activates AMPK. AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172 by CaMKKβ is triggered by an increase in cytosolic calcium levels. AMPK targets several proteins involved in cellular energy balance, including a regulator of fatty acid biosynthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). The calcium/CaMKKβ/AMPK signaling pathway also controls mechanisms relevant to protein degradation by controlling mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling and autophagy (16.H⊘yer-Hansen M. Bastholm L. Szyniarowski P. Campanella M. Szabadkai G. Farkas T. Bianchi K. Fehrenbacher N. Elling F. Rizzuto R. Mathiasen I.S. Jäättelä M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 193-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Indeed, mTOR is a potent repressor of autophagy and is negatively controlled by AMPK (14.Carling D. Sanders M.J. Woods A. Int. J. Obes. 2008; 32: S55-S59Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15.Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar).In recent years, several studies have focused on the potential relationship between AD and metabolic diseases. Obesity and diabetes significantly increase cognitive decline and AD risk (17.Craft S. Arch. Neurol. 2009; 66: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that molecular mechanisms of cellular energy homeostasis are linked to AD pathogenesis. Here we identify the mechanism involved in the anti-amyloidogenic effect of resveratrol by showing that this polyphenol lowered Aβ accumulation via activation of the metabolic sensor AMPK in different cell lines and in mouse primary neurons. Resveratrol activated AMPK by increasing intracellular calcium levels and by promoting AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172 by CaMKKβ. Activation of AMPK by resveratrol resulted in mTOR inhibition and initiation of autophagy and lysosomal clearance of Aβ. Importantly, we also demonstrate that resveratrol, orally administered in mice, reached the brain where it activated AMPK and significantly reduced Aβ levels and deposition in the cerebral cortex, showing that resveratrol is both bioavailable and bioactive in the brain after oral dosing.RESULTSOur previous studies demonstrated that a 24-h incubation with resveratrol significantly reduced extracellular Aβ levels in APP-transfected cells (8.Marambaud P. Zhao H. Davies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37377-37382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Both secreted Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were similarly diminished by resveratrol treatments, with a comparable apparent IC50 of about 30 μm (see Ref. 8.Marambaud P. Zhao H. Davies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37377-37382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar and supplemental Fig. S1). At the same concentrations, resveratrol did not noticeably affect the steady state levels of full-length APP or APP C-terminal fragments (Ref. 8.Marambaud P. Zhao H. Davies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37377-37382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar and supplemental Fig. S1), showing that resveratrol reduced Aβ levels without affecting APP processing.In this study we sought to identify the signaling pathway implicated in the control of Aβ levels by resveratrol. Using a kinase screen analyzing 28 major phosphoproteins, we determined that phosphorylation at Thr-172 on AMPK α2 subunit was the most robust effect of resveratrol in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, A–C). Consistent with an activation of AMPK, resveratrol treatment also resulted in a significant elevation of AMPK α1 subunit phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A–C). Additional positive hits were identified, including the AMPK target CREB (24.Kim E.K. Miller I. Aja S. Landree L.E. Pinn M. McFadden J. Kuhajda F.P. Moran T.H. Ronnett G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19970-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 25.Thomson D.M. Herway S.T. Fillmore N. Kim H. Brown J.D. Barrow J.R. Winder W.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2008; 104: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and the previously reported target of resveratrol, the checkpoint kinase Chk2 (26.Tyagi A. Singh R.P. Agarwal C. Siriwardana S. Sclafani R.A. Agarwal R. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 1978-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A–C). The effect of resveratrol on AMPK and CREB phosphorylation was confirmed by WB analyses. Resveratrol increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and its target ACC in a dose-dependent manner and at concentrations consistent with the effect of this polyphenol on Aβ levels (Fig. 1, D and E). In the same concentration range, resveratrol also strongly increased dose-dependently the phosphorylation of CREB and ATF1, another CREB/ATF family member (Fig. 1, D and E). Notably, resveratrol treatment resulted in a robust increase in c-Fos protein levels (Fig. 1D). c-Fos gene promoter contains cyclic AMP response elements, and CREB is a strong regulator of the transcription of this gene (27.Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A. Shioi J. Takashima A. Siman R. Robakis N.K. Cell. 2003; 114: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 28.Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), suggesting that resveratrol not only increased CREB phosphorylation but also activated its transcriptional activity. Together, these results indicate that one of the primary effects of resveratrol is to target AMPK to increase its phosphorylation at Thr-172 and to promote its activation, as demonstrated by the increased phosphorylation of ACC and CREB upon resveratrol treatment.Like resveratrol, (+)-catechin is a powerful plant-derived antioxidant (29.Yilmaz Y. Toledo R.T. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2004; 52: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Although catechin has some structural similarities with resveratrol, it is ineffective at reducing Aβ levels in cultured cells at concentrations as high as 40 μm (see Fig. 1, F and G, and Ref. 8.Marambaud P. Zhao H. Davies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37377-37382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). We found that catechin had no effect on AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1G), suggesting that the effect on Aβ levels and AMPK activation is relatively specific to resveratrol and independent of its antioxidant properties.The activating phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172 is primarily controlled by two kinases, LKB1 and CaMKKβ. LKB1 activation is tightly controlled by ATP levels via changes in the AMP/ATP ratio (14.Carling D. Sanders M.J. Woods A. Int. J. Obes. 2008; 32: S55-S59Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15.Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Because resveratrol was proposed to influence cellular ATP levels (30.Zheng J. Ramirez V.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), we examined whether resveratrol affects ATP levels upon conditions inhibiting Aβ accumulation in HEK293 cells. We found no effect of 20 or 40 μm resveratrol on ATP levels (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, resveratrol treatment was still able to promote AMPK phosphorylation in the LKB1-deficient HeLa cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that LKB1 activation is not required for the effect of resveratrol on AMPK phosphorylation. We then asked whether resveratrol modulates cytosolic calcium levels in treated cells. Measurements of intracellular calcium levels were conducted under resting conditions in the presence of physiological levels of extracellular calcium. To reveal possible changes in the rate of calcium entry in treated cells, measurements were also performed under extracellular calcium add-back conditions, as previously described (21.Dreses-Werringloer U. Lambert J.C. Vingtdeux V. Zhao H. Vais H. Siebert A. Jain A. Koppel J. Rovelet-Lecrux A. Hannequin D. Pasquier F. Galimberti D. Scarpini E. Mann D. Lendon C. Campion D. Amouyel P. Davies P. Foskett J.K. Campagne F. Marambaud P. Cell. 2008; 133: 1149-1161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These conditions are obtained after a transient external calcium depletion to generate a driving force for calcium entry into the cells. Using the calcium fluorescent dye Fluo-4, we found that resveratrol significantly increased cytosolic calcium levels both at resting conditions and after calcium add-back (Fig. 2, C and D). Because cytosolic calcium levels are also controlled by release of the ion from intracellular stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we also evaluated the effect of resveratrol treatment on ER calcium levels. Measurements of ER calcium levels were performed by blocking the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA), a manipulation that generates a passive leak of calcium from the ER to the cytosol. In Fluo-4-loaded cells, in the absence of extracellular calcium, and in the presence of the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin, resveratrol dose-dependently reduced the levels of ER calcium (Fig. 2E). Together these results show that resveratrol impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis by significantly increasing cytosolic calcium levels and by facilitating both calcium entry and ER calcium depletion. Because CaMKKβ is activated by an increase in cytosolic calcium, we then asked whether CaMKKβ is involved in the activation of AMPK by resveratrol. We found that the CaMKKβ inhibitor STO-609 effectively reduced the effect of resveratrol on the phosphorylation of both AMPK and ACC (Fig. 2F), indicating that resveratrol increased cytosolic calcium to promote CaMKKβ-dependent phosphorylation and activation of AMPK.FIGURE 2Resveratrol increases intracellular calcium levels and promotes CaMKKβ-dependent phosphorylation of AMPK.

Pharmacological activation of AMPK by the use of the AMP analog AICAR strongly and significantly lowered extracellular Aβ levels in HEK293 and N2a cells (Fig. 3, A–D). AICAR treatments at concentrations reducing Aβ resulted in a robust increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC (Fig. 3, A and B), confirming the activation of AMPK in these conditions. In addition, genetic activation of AMPK by transfection of a constitutively active form of AMPK α1 subunit (31.Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) led to a robust increase of ACC phosphorylation and to a significant reduction of Aβ levels (Fig. 3, E–G). Thus, AMPK activation in cell lines lowered extracellular Aβ accumulation, including Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42. Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative form of AMPK (31.Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) significantly inhibited the effect of resveratrol on ACC phosphorylation (Fig. 3, H and I) and on the levels of secreted Aβ (Fig. 3H), including Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 (Fig. 3J). Together these data show that resveratrol lowered Aβ levels by activating AMPK.FIGURE 3Resveratrol lowers Aβ levels by activating AMPK.

By immunofluorescence in adult mouse brain, we found that activated AMPK is present in most cortical and hippocampal neurons, as shown by the strong colocalization between phosphorylated AMPK and the neuronal marker NeuN (Fig. 4A, panels a–f). No significant staining for phosphorylated AMPK was found in hippocampal astrocytes (Fig. 4A, panels g–i), indicating that under constitutive conditions in the brain, AMPK is mostly active in neurons. Using immunocytochemistry, we confirmed that activated AMPK is present in primary neuronal cultures (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Resveratrol lowers Aβ levels by activating AMPK in primary neurons.

We found that resveratrol significantly and in a dose-dependent manner reduced secreted Aβ levels in primary neurons isolated from APP transgenic mouse forebrain (Fig. 4D), whereas full-length APP levels remained unchanged (Fig. 4C). At concentrations reducing Aβ, resveratrol led to an increase in phosphorylated AMPK and ACC (Fig. 4C), showing that resveratrol can activate AMPK in forebrain neurons. Direct activation of AMPK with AICAR also resulted in a significant decrease in neuronal Aβ levels (Fig. 4, E and F). Importantly, pretreatment with the AMPK inhibitor, compound C, significantly prevented the effect of resveratrol on neuronal Aβ levels (Fig. 4, G and H). Together, these results show that in neurons resveratrol reduced secreted Aβ accumulation by activating AMPK.To gain insight into the mechanism by which resveratrol promotes a reduction of Aβ levels, we asked whether the polyphenol facilitates intracellular degradation of Aβ. Our previous work has shown that resveratrol does not significantly affect APP processing and Aβ production but instead facilitates intracellular Aβ clearance (8.Marambaud P. Zhao H. Davies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37377-37382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). AMPK is a key regulator of autophagy (or macroautophagy), an evolutionary conserved lysosomal pathway involved in protein and organelle turnover via the formation of vacuoles known as autophagosomes (36.Maiuri M.C. Zalckvar E. Kimchi A. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar). Autophagy is deregulated in AD brain and participates in intracellular Aβ degradation in vitro and in vivo (37.Jaeger P.A. Wyss-Coray T. Mol. Neurodegener. 2009; 4: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 38.Nixon R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4081-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). AMPK activation promotes autophagy by repressing the Ser/Thr protein kinase mTOR, which represents a key blocker of autophagosome formation (39.Meijer A.J. Codogno P. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Interestingly, resveratrol was found to induce autophagy in cancer cell lines (40.Opipari Jr., A.W. Tan L. Boitano A.E. Sorenson D.R. Aurora A. Liu J.R. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In this context we asked whether resveratrol (i) inhibits mTOR activity, (ii) promotes autophagy, and (iii) leads to intracellular degradation of Aβ by the lysosomal system.We observed that treatments of HEK293 cells with resveratrol resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation of p70-S6 kinase, eIF4B (eukaryotic initiation factor 4B), and S6 ribosomal protein, three proteins downstream from mTOR activation (Fig. 5, A and B). Importantly, resveratrol treatments also led to a strong and dose-dependent conversion of the light chain 3 (LC3) protein from LC3-I to LC3-II, which represents a marker for autophagy induction (Fig. 5, C–E). Furthermore, formation of autophagosomes immunoreactive for LC3 was observed in the presence of resveratrol (Fig. 5F). Finally, treatment with the lysosomotropic drugs bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, which neutralize lysosomal degradation, resulted in a significant increase of intracellular Aβ accumulation in the presence of resveratrol (Fig. 5, G and H). In summary, these data show that resveratrol inhibited mTOR to induce autophagy and intracellular degradation of Aβ by the lysosomal system.FIGURE 5Resveratrol induces autophagy and lysosomal degradation of Aβ.

Though reactions with hydroxide salts to form carbonates tend to proceed fairly cleanly, reductive processes to form carboxylic acids, esters, and alcohols are often rather unselective. Angamuthu et al.

Acidification of media containing various Fe compounds decreases the Fe uptake rate of diatoms and coccolithophores to an extent predicted by the changes in Fe chemistry. A slower Fe uptake by a model diatom with decreasing pH is also seen in experiments with Atlantic surface water. The Fe requirement of model phytoplankton remains unchanged with increasing CO2. The ongoing acidification of seawater is likely to increase the Fe stress of phytoplankton populations in some areas of the ocean."

We determined that BanLec inhibits primary and laboratory-adapted HIV-1 isolates of different tropisms and subtypes. BanLec possesses potent anti-HIV activity, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar to picomolar range. The mechanism for BanLec-mediated antiviral activity was investigated by determining if this lectin can directly bind the HIV-1 envelope protein and block entry of the virus into the cell.

Furthermore, BanLec is able to block HIV-1 cellular entry as indicated by temperature-sensitive viral entry studies and by the decreased levels of the strong-stop product of early reverse transcription seen in the presence of BanLec.

https://openalex.org/W1997557358,"The p53 pathway is disrupted in virtually every human tumor. In approximately 50% of human cancers, the p53 gene is mutated, and in the remaining cancers, the pathway is dysregulated by genetic lesions in other genes that modulate the p53 pathway. One common mechanism for inactivation of the p53 pathway in tumors that express wild-type p53 is increased expression of MDM2 or MDMX. MDM2 and MDMX bind p53 and inhibit its function by distinct nonredundant mechanisms. Small molecule inhibitors and small peptides have been developed that bind MDM2 in the p53-binding pocket and displace the p53 protein, leading to p53-mediated cell cycle exit and apoptosis. To date, peptide inhibitors of MDMX have been developed, but no small molecule inhibitors have been reported. We have developed biochemical and cell-based assays for high throughput screening of chemical libraries to identify MDMX inhibitors and identified the first MDMX inhibitor SJ-172550. This compound binds reversibly to MDMX and effectively kills retinoblastoma cells in which the expression of MDMX is amplified. The effect of SJ-172550 is additive when combined with an MDM2 inhibitor. Results from a series of biochemical and structural modeling studies suggest that SJ-172550 binds the p53-binding pocket of MDMX, thereby displacing p53. This lead compound is a useful chemical scaffold for further optimization of MDMX inhibitors that may eventually be used to treat pediatric cancers and various adult tumors that overexpress MDMX or have similar genetic lesions. When combined with selective MDM2 inhibitors, SJ-172550 may also be useful for treating tumors that express wild-type p53."

https://openalex.org/W2007697111,"Rho is the essential RNA helicase that sets the borders between transcription units and adjusts transcriptional yield to translational needs in bacteria. Although Rho was the first termination factor to be discovered, the actual mechanism by which it reaches and disrupts the elongation complex (EC) is unknown. Here we show that the termination-committed Rho molecule associates with RNA polymerase (RNAP) throughout the transcription cycle; that is, it does not require the nascent transcript for initial binding. Moreover, the formation of the RNAP-Rho complex is crucial for termination. We show further that Rho-dependent termination is a two-step process that involves rapid EC inactivation (trap) and a relatively slow dissociation. Inactivation is the critical rate-limiting step that establishes the position of the termination site. The trap mechanism depends on the allosterically induced rearrangement of the RNAP catalytic centre by means of the evolutionarily conserved mobile trigger-loop domain, which is also required for EC dissociation. The key structural and functional similarities, which we found between Rho-dependent and intrinsic (Rho-independent) termination pathways, argue that the allosteric mechanism of termination is general and likely to be preserved for all cellular RNAPs throughout evolution."

The purpose of our investigation was to explore the cellular mechanisms of release used by various members of the ULBP family. Using biochemical and cellular approaches in both transfectant systems and tumor cell lines, this paper shows that ULBP1, ULBP2, and ULBP3 are released from cells with different kinetics and by distinct mechanisms. Whereas ULBP2 is mainly shed by metalloproteases, ULBP3 is abundantly released as part of membrane vesicles known as exosomes. Interestingly, exosomal ULBP3 protein is much more potent for down-modulation of the NKG2D receptor than soluble ULBP2 protein. This is the first report showing functionally relevant differences in the biochemistry of the three members of the ULBP family and confirms that in depth study of the biochemical features of individual NKG2D ligands will be necessary to understand and manipulate the biology of these proteins for therapy."

Phytochromes regulate numerous photoresponses in plants and microorganisms through their ability to photointerconvert between a red-light-absorbing, ground state (Pf) and a far-red-light-absorbing, photoactivated state (Pfr). The structures of several phytochromes as Pf have been determined previously; here, the three-dimensional solution structure of the bilin-binding domain as Pfr is described. The results shed light on the structural basis for photoconversion to the activated Pfr form. Phytochromes are a collection of bilin-containing photoreceptors that regulate numerous photoresponses in plants and microorganisms through their ability to photointerconvert between a red-light-absorbing, ground state (Pr) and a far-red-light-absorbing, photoactivated state (Pfr)1,2.

Here we describe the three-dimensional solution structure of the bilin-binding domain as Pfr, using the cyanobacterial phytochrome from Synechococcus OSB′. Contrary to predictions, light-induced rotation of the A pyrrole ring but not the D ring is the primary motion of the chromophore during photoconversion. Subsequent rearrangements within the protein then affect intradomain and interdomain contact sites within the phytochrome dimer. On the basis of our models, we propose that phytochromes act by propagating reversible light-driven conformational changes in the bilin to altered contacts between the adjacent output domains, which in most phytochromes direct differential phosphotransfer."

https://openalex.org/W2044910634,"Transforming Growth Factor (TGF-beta1) is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily ligand-receptor network. and plays a crucial role in tissue regeneration. The extensive in vitro and in vivo experimental literature describing its actions nevertheless describe an apparent paradox in that during re-epithelialisation it acts as proliferation inhibitor for keratinocytes. The majority of biological models focus on certain aspects of TGF-beta1 behaviour and no one model provides a comprehensive story of this regulatory factor's action. Accordingly our aim was to develop a computational model to act as a complementary approach to improve our understanding of TGF-beta1. In our previous study, an agent-based model of keratinocyte colony formation in 2D culture was developed. In this study this model was extensively developed into a three dimensional multiscale model of the human epidermis which is comprised of three interacting and integrated layers: (1) an agent-based model which captures the biological rules governing the cells in the human epidermis at the cellular level and includes the rules for injury induced emergent behaviours, (2) a COmplex PAthway SImulator (COPASI) model which simulates the expression and signalling of TGF-beta1 at the sub-cellular level and (3) a mechanical layer embodied by a numerical physical solver responsible for resolving the forces exerted between cells at the multi-cellular level. The integrated model was initially validated by using it to grow a piece of virtual epidermis in 3D and comparing the in virtuo simulations of keratinocyte behaviour and of TGF-beta1 signalling with the extensive research literature describing this key regulatory protein. This research reinforces the idea that computational modelling can be an effective additional tool to aid our understanding of complex systems. In the accompanying paper the model is used to explore hypotheses of the functions of TGF-beta1 at the cellular and subcellular level on different keratinocyte populations during epidermal wound healing."

To test a hypothesis that allergen-associated glycans serve as the molecular patterns in functional interaction with CLRs, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay was performed to determine the binding activity of purified allergens and allergen extracts. THP-1 cells and monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) were investigated as a model for testing the functional effects of allergen-CLR interaction using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, and flow cytometry. Significant and saturable bindings of allergens and allergen extracts with variable binding activities to DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and its related receptor, L-SIGN, were found. These include bovine serum albumin coupled with a common glycoform (fucosylated glycan lacking the alpha1,3-linked mannose) of allergens and a panel of purified allergens, including BG60 (Cyn dBG-60; Bermuda grass pollen) and Der p2 (house dust mite). The binding activity was calcium-dependent and inhibitable by fucose and Lewis-x trisaccharides (Le(x)). In THP-1 cells and human MDDCs, BG60-DC-SIGN interaction led to the activation of Raf-1 and ERK kinases and the induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression. This effect could be blocked, in part, by Raf-1 inhibitor or anti-DC-SIGN antibodies and was significantly reduced in cells with DC-SIGN knockdown. These results suggest that allergens are able to interact with DC-SIGN and induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in MDDCs via, in part, Raf-1 signaling pathways."

Furthermore, we find that the mouse Vasa homolog associates with Tudor domain-containing proteins, Tdrd1 and Tdrd6, as well as the Piwi proteins, Mili and Miwi. Arginine methylation is thus emerging as a conserved and pivotal post-translational modification of proteins that is essential for germline development."

D2R knock-out mice (D2R−/−) show reduced food intake and body weight while displaying an increased basal energy expenditure level, compared with their wild type littermates. Thus, these mice show a lean phenotype. D2R−/− mice displayed increased leptin sensitivity, and leptin injection induced increased phosphorylation of the hypothalamic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in D2R−/− mice relative to wild type littermates. Using double immunofluorescence histochemistry, we have demonstrated that D2Rs are present in leptin-sensitive STAT3-positive cells in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and that leptin injection induces STAT3 phosphorylation in hypothalamic neurons expressing D2Rs. Stimulation of D2R by the D2R agonist quinpirole suppressed the leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear trans-localization of phospho-STAT3 in the hypothalamus of wild type mice. However, this regulation was not detected in the D2R−/− mice. Treatment of D2R agonist and antagonist could modulate the leptin-induced food intake and body weight changes in wild type mice but not in D2R−/− mice. Together, our findings suggest that the interaction between the dopaminergic system and leptin signaling in hypothalamus is important in control of energy homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2053132501,"Polarity proteins promote the asymmetric organization of cells by orienting intracellular sorting mechanisms, such as protein trafficking and cytoskeletal assembly. The localization of individual polarity proteins in turn is often determined by association with factors that mediate contact with other cells or the substratum. This arrangement for the Par and Crb apical polarity complexes at the tight junction is disrupted by the adaptor protein Amot. Amot directly binds the scaffolding proteins Patj and Mupp1 and redistributes them and their binding partners from the plasma membrane to endosomes. However, the mechanism by which Amot is targeted to endosomes is unknown. Here, a novel lipid binding domain within Amot is shown to selectively bind with high affinity to membranes containing monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositols and cholesterol. With similar lipid specificity, Amot inserts into and tubulates membranes in vitro and enlarges perinuclear endosomal compartments in cells. Based on the similar distribution of Amot with cholesterol, Rab11, and Arf6, such membrane interactions are identified at juxtanuclear endocytic recycling compartments. Taken together, these findings indicate that Amot is targeted along with associated apical polarity proteins to the endocytic recycling compartment via this novel membrane binding domain."

Despite intensive investigation into the physiological roles of GSK-3 isoforms, the basis for their differential activities remains unresolved. A more comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic basis for GSK-3 isoform-specific functions could lead to the development of isoform-specific inhibitors. Here, we describe a structure-function analysis of GSK-3α and GSK-3β in mammalian cells. We deleted the noncatalytic N and C termini in both GSK-3 isoforms and generated point mutations of key regulatory residues. We examined the effect of these mutations on GSK-3 activity toward Tau, activity in Wnt signaling, interaction with Axin, and GSK-3α/β Tyr279/216 phosphorylation. We found that the N termini of both GSK-3 isoforms were dispensable, whereas progressive C-terminal deletions resulted in protein misfolding exhibited by deficient activity, impaired ability to interact with Axin, and a loss of Tyr279/216 phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2063657209,"In this report, we demonstrate that cellular stress regulates expression of IFRD1 by a post-transcriptional control mechanism. IFRD1 mRNA and protein are elevated in tunicamycin-treated human kidney epithelial cells via stabilization of the mRNA. IFRD1 mRNA instability in resting cells requires translation of an upstream open reading frame (ORF) that represses translation of the major ORF. During stress response, the mRNA is stabilized via inhibition of translational initiation mediated by phosphorylated eIF2alpha. Translation of the major ORF of IFRD1 involves both leaky scanning at the upstream AUG codon and re-initiation at the major AUG codon and is not altered during stress. Finally, the instability mechanism depends upon UPF1, suggesting that it is related to nonsense-mediated decay. Importantly, the sequence and length of the upstream ORF are critical but do not need to code for a specific peptide. Moreover the sequence environment of the upstream ORF termination site is not an essential feature of instability. These features of decay collectively define a distinct upstream ORF-mediated instability mechanism whereby cellular stress can modulate specific gene expression through alteration of mRNA half-life."

https://openalex.org/W1964333230,"Normal mammary development requires coordinated interactions of numerous factors, including prolactin (PRL) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), both of which have also been implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis and progression. We previously reported that PRL and IGF-I synergize in breast cancer cells to activate ERK1/2 and AKT, leading to increased proliferation, survival, and invasion. Intriguingly, PRL co-treatment with IGF-I augments IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) phosphorylation 2-fold higher than IGF-I alone. Here, we showed the importance of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in this cross-talk using pharmacological inhibition and small interfering RNA. SHP-2 recruitment to IGF-IR was significantly attenuated by PRL co-treatment. Src family kinase activity was required for IGF-IR association with SHP-2, ligand-induced IGF-IR internalization, and PRL-enhanced IGF-IR phosphorylation. Inhibition of internalization, via knockdown of the GTPase, dynamin-2, prevented not only IGF-IR dephosphorylation, but also PRL-enhanced IGF-IR phosphorylation. Consistently, PRL diminished IGF-I-induced IGF-IR internalization, which may result from reduced SHP-2 association with IGF-IR, because we demonstrated an essential role for SHP-2 in IGF-IR internalization. Together, these findings describe a novel mechanism of cross-talk between PRL and IGF-I in breast cancer cells, with implications for our understanding of tumor progression and potential therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2037591932,"DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenital critical region on X chromosome, gene 1) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that can repress diverse nuclear receptors and has a key role in adreno-gonadal development. Our previous report has demonstrated that DAX-1 can inhibit hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha transactivity and negatively regulate gluconeogenic gene expression (Nedumaran, B., Hong, S., Xie, Y. B., Kim, Y. H., Seo, W. Y., Lee, M. W., Lee, C. H., Koo, S. H., and Choi, H. S. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 27511-27523). Here, we further expand the role of DAX-1 in hepatic energy metabolism. Transfection assays have demonstrated that DAX-1 can inhibit the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptor liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha). Physical interaction between DAX-1 and LXRalpha was confirmed Immunofluorescent staining in mouse liver shows that LXRalpha and DAX-1 are colocalized in the nucleus. Domain mapping analysis shows that the entire region of DAX-1 is involved in the interaction with the ligand binding domain region of LXRalpha. Competition analyses demonstrate that DAX-1 competes with the coactivator SRC-1 for repressing LXRalpha transactivity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that endogenous DAX-1 recruitment on the SREBP-1c gene promoter was decreased in the presence of LXRalpha agonist. Overexpression of DAX-1 inhibits T7-induced LXRalpha target gene expression, whereas knockdown of endogenous DAX-1 significantly increases T7-induced LXRalpha target gene expression in HepG2 cells. Finally, overexpression of DAX-1 in mouse liver decreases T7-induced LXRalpha target gene expression, liver triglyceride level, and lipid accumulation. Overall, this study suggests that DAX-1, a novel corepressor of LXRalpha, functions as a negative regulator of lipogenic enzyme gene expression in liver."

The Rho family of small GTPases and the PDZ (PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1) domain-based adaptor Shank2 are known to regulate the membrane expression and activity of NHE3. In this study we examined the role of βPix, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho GTPase and a strong binding partner to Shank2, in NHE3 regulation using integrated molecular and physiological approaches. Immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays revealed that NHE3, Shank2, and βPix form a macromolecular complex when expressed heterologously in mammalian cells as well as endogenously in rat colon, kidney, and pancreas. In addition, these proteins co-segregated at the apical surface of rat colonic epithelial cells, as detected by immunofluorescence staining. When expressed in PS120/NHE3 cells, βPix increased membrane expression and basal activity of NHE3. Interestingly, the effects of βPix on NHE3 were abolished by cotransfection with dominant-negative Shank2 mutants and by treatment with Clostridium difficile toxin B, a Rho GTPase inhibitor, indicating that Shank2 and Rho GTPases are involved in βPix-mediated NHE3 regulation. Knockdown of endogenous βPix by RNA interference decreased Shank2-induced increase of NHE3 membrane expression in HEK 293T cells.

https://openalex.org/W1972063997,"The effects of decylubiquinone, a ubiquinone analogue, on mitochondrial function and inhibition thresholds of the electron transport chain enzyme complexes in synaptosomes were investigated. Decylubiquinone increased complex I/III and complex II/III activities by 64 and 80%, respectively, and attenuated reductions in oxygen consumption at high concentrations of the complex III inhibitor myxothiazol. During inhibition of complex I, decylubiquinone attenuated reductions in synaptosomal oxygen respiration rates, as seen in the complex I inhibition threshold. Decylubiquinone increased the inhibition thresholds of complex I/III, complex II/III, and complex III over oxygen consumption in the nerve terminal by 25-50%, when myxothiazol was used to inhibit complex III. These results imply that decylubiquinone increases mitochondrial function in the nerve terminal during complex I or III inhibition.

More recently they have gained recognition as producers of several unique polyketide and nonribosomal polypeptide metabolites with potential therapeutic value. The biosynthesis of these compounds often involves highly unusual mechanisms including the formation of the chloro-hydroxy-styryl moiety of the chondrochloren antibiotic produced by Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5. Here it is shown that the final product of the chondrochloren megasynthetase is the novel natural product pre-chondrochloren, a carboxylated and saturated derivative of chondrochloren. This compound was isolated from strains harboring mutants of a hypothetical oxidative decarboxylase (CndG) identified in the chondrochloren gene cluster. CndG was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to be an FAD-dependent oxidative decarboxylase. Biochemical characterization of the protein was achieved using the intermediate described above as the substrate and yielded chondrochloren by oxidative decarboxylation. It was also demonstrated that the CndG post-assembly line modification of pre-chondrochloren is essential for the biological activity of chondrochloren."

In response to low calcium or high phosphate plasma levels, PTH is synthesized in and secreted from the parathyroid glands. The primary effector organs for PTH are kidney and bone. In the kidney, PTH stimulates reabsorption of calcium from renal tubules, stimulates 1,25-dihydroxyvitamine D synthesis, and prevents reabsorption of phosphate. In bone, PTH mediates bone resorption by osteoclasts and reduces osteoblast proliferation, resulting in calcium liberation and decreased bone mass (1.Potts J.T. J.

The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated for 2 h with anti-HA affinity agarose or anti-FLAG affinity agarose. The precipitates were collected by gentle centrifugation and washed three times in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The blots were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated, and bound antibodies were visualized with secondary antibodies and ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Pulse-chase experiments were essentially done as described elsewhere (19.Klenk C. Humrich J. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cells stably expressing HA-PTHR were starved for 1 h in Met/Cys-depleted Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAN Biotech) and labeled for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing [35S]Met/Cys (150 μCi/ml). The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and chased with complete culture medium supplemented with 2 mm methionine and 2 mm cysteine for 1–12 h in the absence or presence of 100 nm PTH(1–34). Subsequently, the cells were lysed, PTHR was precipitated with anti-HA affinity agarose as described above, and the precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were Coomassie-stained, soaked with Amplify fluorographic solution (GE Healthcare), and dried. Radiolabeled HA-PTHR was visualized and quantified by autoradiography on a PMI phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). PTHR was precipitated with anti-HA affinity agarose as described above. The precipitates were eluted from the affinity resin and denatured with 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, for 40 min at room temperature. Before the enzyme reaction, the eluates were diluted 10-fold with either buffer E (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol; Endo H), buffer P (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol; PNGase F), or buffer N (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0; Neuraminidase). All of the buffers were supplemented with a mix of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 30 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The enzymes were added at final concentrations of 5 units/ml PNGase F, 250 units/ml Endo H, or 50 units/ml neuraminidase. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and the reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. Fresh tissue from human kidney was homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) supplemented with a mix of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 30 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using an Ultra-Turrax tissue homogenizer followed by brief sonification. Homogenates were diluted 1:1 with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, incubated on a rotary wheel for 1 h at 4 °C, and cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated for 3 h with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. The precipitates were collected by gentle centrifugation and washed three times in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 0.5 m N-acetylglucosamine, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (w/v), 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and concentrated with a Microcon centrifugal filter device (10,000 molecular weight cut-off; Millipore). CHO cells stably expressing HA-PTHR were grown on coverslips overnight. The cells were then exposed to different ligands for 30 min as indicated. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, for 30 min at room temperature and washed five times in phosphate-buffered saline. For permeabilization the cells were incubated for 5 min in methanol. After 10 min of preincubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound primary antibody was detected with Cy2-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200). The specimens were examined using a Leica SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope. Wild type dynamin (DynWT) and dynamin K44A (DynK44A) cDNAs in the pCB1 vector were kindly provided by Dr. Marc Caron (Duke University, Durham, NC). Dynamin cDNA fragments were excised from pCB1 plasmids and cloned between the EcoRI and XmaI sites of vector pIRES2-AcGFP1-Nuc (Clontech). Thereafter, the entire cassettes containing dynamin, IRES, and nuclear green fluorescent protein sequences were removed and cloned into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pENTR vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently introduced into adenoviral vectors (pAD/CMV/V5-DEST; Invitrogen) by homologous recombination. Recombinant adenoviral vectors were generated by standard procedures following the manufacturer's instructions. Adenovirus titers were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm with a spectrophotometer. Although PTH(1–34) and PTH(1–14) have been described to fully activate the PTHR with almost equal potency compared with full-length PTH, PTH(1–31) has been reported to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity but not to activate protein kinase C (20.Jouishomme H. Whitfield J.F. Gagnon L. Maclean S. Isaacs R. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J. Neugebauer W. Willick G. Rixon R.H. J.

PTH(7–34) is a competitive antagonist to PTH(1–34) and is believed to have no intrinsic activity (22.Goldring S.R. Roelke M.S. Bringhurst F.R. Rosenblatt M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). First, we investigated the capacity of these four PTH peptides to induce PTHR internalization. CHO cells stably expressing HA-tagged PTHR were incubated with saturating concentrations of PTH(1–34), PTH(1–31), PTH(1–14), or PTH(7–34) for 30 min. To monitor PTHR trafficking, the cells were fixed, PTHR was stained with an anti-HA antibody followed by a Cy2-coupled secondary antibody, and confocal images of each condition were taken. Although in unstimulated cells the receptor was mainly distributed at the cell surface, treatment with the agonistic peptides PTH(1–34), PTH(1–31), or PTH(1–14) resulted in a perinuclear accumulation of immunoreactive vesicles indicating a rapid internalization of PTHR. In contrast, the antagonistic peptide PTH(7–34) did not significantly internalize the receptor (Fig. 1A). To assess how prolonged stimulation affected PTHR internalization and to assess the extent of internalization, CHO cells stably expressing HA-tagged PTHR were incubated with 100 nm PTH(1–34) or 1 μm PTH(7–34) for 30 min, 3 h, or 6 h. The cells were fixed and either permeabilized with methanol or left unpermeabilized to detect receptor at the cell surface only. PTHR was visualized as described above. As shown in Fig. 1B, PTH(1–34) almost completely internalized the receptor from the cell surface. Also, continuous application of PTH(1–34) for up to 6 h did not lead to a significant recovery of the receptor levels at the cell surface. In contrast, neither given as a short pulse nor applied for up to 6 h did PTH(7–34) have an effect on PTHR internalization. Next, we investigated the effect of prolonged application of PTH on the PTHR protein. CHO cells stably expressing HA-tagged PTHR were incubated with saturating concentrations of different PTH peptide fragments for 30 min to 12 h. PTHR expression was monitored in Western blots from whole cell lysates and was detected as a broad band with an approximate molecular mass of 90 kDa. Interestingly, with the progressive presence of agonistic peptides an increasing fraction of the PTHR appeared to have a slower electrophoretic mobility compared with unstimulated receptors (Fig. 2A). Moreover, in PTH(1–34)-, PTH(1–31)-, and PTH(1–14)-treated cells, an increased immunoreactive signal was detected, suggesting an increase of PTHR protein levels. Repeating these experiments in the presence of cycloheximide to block protein synthesis did not diminish the PTH(1–34) evoked increase in protein levels (supplemental Fig. S1), thus suggesting that PTH(1–34) rather reduces the degradation of PTHR than stimulates protein expression. In contrast, cells treated with the antagonistic peptide PTH(7–34) exhibited major changes neither of PTHR mass nor of protein levels (Fig. 2B). To confirm these observations in a more physiological setting, we used rat osteosarcoma cells that stably expressed HA-PTHR. Again, a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the PTHR was observed after prolonged stimulation with PTH(1–34) along with an increasing signal strength (Fig. 2C). The HA-tagged PTHR, which was used in the above experiments, has been shown to have similar properties to wild type PTHR in terms of ligand binding and signaling (16.Lee C. Gardella T.J.

Krasel C. Bernhardt M. Lohse M.J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3854-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, to exclude that the observed effects of PTH were caused by the modification of the PTHR with an HA epitope, we compared CHO cells stably expressing either HA-tagged PTHR or wild type human PTHR. To visualize wild type PTHR, we generated an antiserum against the final 21 amino acids in the C terminus of the human PTHR; this antiserum detected human HA-PTHR as well as human wild type PTHR with high sensitivity and specificity (18.Lupp, A., Klenk, C., Röcken, C., Evert, M., Mawrin, C., Schulz, S. (2010) Eur. J. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). After 12 h of incubation with 100 nm PTH(1–34), an increased molecular mass was detected for HA-PTHR (Fig. 2D, left panel) as well as for wild type PTHR (Fig. 2D, right panel) compared with unstimulated receptor. This indicated that the observed difference of molecular mass was not affected by the HA epitope and suggests that the stimulation of PTHR does indeed change its electrophoretic mobility and increase its levels. Previous studies revealed that some ligands may facilitate the maturation of vasopressin 2 receptor mutants and the δ opioid receptor by acting as molecular chaperones. These ligands promoted glycosylation of immature receptors, which are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore in these two examples mature and immature receptors differ in their glycosylation pattern. Although immature receptors were susceptible to deglycosylation by Endo H and by PNGase F, mature receptors were resistant to Endo H (23.Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperrière A. Bernier V. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Petäjä-Repo U. Angers S. Morin D. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 24.Petäjä-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Bhalla S. Laperrière A. Morello J.P. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). PTHR is highly glycosylated at four N-glycosylation sites constituting ∼30% of the apparent molecular mass of the mature receptor (25.Schipani E. Karga H. Karaplis A.C. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To test whether a similar mechanism of molecular chaperoning could underlie our findings for the PTHR, we assessed the glycosylation pattern of unstimulated and PTH-treated PTHR. CHO cells expressing HA-PTHR were stimulated with PTH(1–34) for 12 h, HA-PTHR was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA agarose, and precipitates were treated with neuraminidase, Endo H, or PNGase F. As can be seen in Fig. 3, neither neuraminidase nor Endoglycosidase H affected the mobility of the PTHR without or with prior PTH treatment (lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 6 and 7). PNGase F treatment, however, resulted in three different bands with approximate Mr values of 50,000, 57,000, and 60,000 (lane 4). In cells that had been treated with PTH, only a single band with a Mr of 60,000 was observed after PNGase F deglycosylation (lane 8). Thus, the change in mobility of the PTHR after prolonged PTH treatment does not appear to be due to altered glycosylation because it was also seen after PNGase F-induced deglycosylation. Moreover, complete deglycosylation with PNGase F revealed an apparent difference of ∼10 kDa between the smallest and the largest receptor proteins. Because glycosylation seemed not to be responsible for the different molecular weight species of the PTHR, we set out to monitor PTHR maturation in the absence or presence of PTH by metabolic labeling. CHO cells stably expressing HA-PTHR were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and then chased in medium containing unlabeled amino acids. The chase medium was supplemented with PTH(1–34) or PTH(7–34) or without any ligand. Subsequently, the cells were lysed, and the receptors were isolated by immunoprecipitation and detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Two major forms of the PTHR were detected: a Mr 75,000 species, which was present directly after the pulse and most probably represents core-glycosylated receptor, and a Mr 100,000 species, which appeared after 1 h of chase and was the predominant form after 3 h, therefore presumably representing fully glycosylated PTHR (Fig. 4, A–C). Interestingly, in the course of chase in the absence of PTH, the Mr 100,000 form progressively lost mass, resulting in an effective molecular weight of ∼90,000 after 12 h of chase (Fig. 4A). In contrast, when PTH(1–34) was present during the chase, the molecular weight of the mature PTHR remained constant at 100,000 (Fig. 4B). When we applied the antagonist PTH(7–34) to the chase medium, no stabilization of the PTHR protein was detectable, comparable with the situation without any ligand (Fig. 4C). Moreover, when comparing the stability of the radiolabeled PTHR over time, a strong difference in protein half-life was observed: although in the absence of ligand and in the presence of PTH(7–34) PTHR had half-lives of 12 and 7 h, respectively, PTH(1–34) led to a dramatic stabilization resulting in a half-life estimated at >60 h (Fig. 4D). Together with the above findings, these results indicate that the PTHR protein undergoes a degradative process during its lifetime, resulting in a reduced protein mass and ultimately leading to reduced protein stability. This process can be blocked by the presence of PTH(1–34) but not of PTH(7–34). Taking into account that changes in receptor glycosylation were not responsible for the different electrophoretic mobilities of the PTHR and that the receptor mass decreased over time, we speculated whether a proteolytic event might be occurring. In such a case, the extracellular N terminus or the intracellular C terminus would most likely be affected. However, as we demonstrated that an antibody directed against the PTHR C terminus still was capable of detecting both the high and the low molecular weight PTHR form (Fig. 2D), a cleavage in the PTHR C terminus seemed unlikely. The HA epitope, which was used for detection of the PTHR, had been inserted into the extracellular domain in exon E2 of the PTHR (amino acids 93–101). Both the fully processed and the apparently degraded forms of the receptor were equally well detected with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2, A–C), giving rise to the assumption that a potential proteolytic cleavage should occur in the PTHR extracellular domain N-terminal from the HA epitope. To investigate this, we generated a PTHR mutant containing a FLAG epitope directly after the signal peptide and an HA epitope in exon E2 (Fig. 5A). CHO cells stably expressing this receptor construct were treated with PTH(1–34) for 12 h, and Western blots of cell lysates were probed with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. As expected, in the HA blots a Mr 90,000 band and a Mr 100,000 band were detectable in cells without and with PTH incubation, respectively (Fig. 5B, left panel). In contrast, the anti-FLAG antibody detected only"

First, as a precocious undergraduate at the University of Chicago and then as a graduate student and Junior Fellow at Harvard University, he found economics to be a discursive, almost ruminative, discipline, even though its basic observables—prices and amounts of goods and services—were obviously ripe for systematic quantification. To his delight, he found that reformulation in standard mathematical terms led not only to great gains in clarity and transparency, but also to new analytical results, a broader scope for the discipline, and the uncovering of unifying principles that both simplified and deepened it. His work transformed the method, content, and whole atmosphere of economic research."
