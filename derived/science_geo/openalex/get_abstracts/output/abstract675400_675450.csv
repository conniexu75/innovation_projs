https://openalex.org/W3168171782,"Newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of an ongoing global pandemic leading to severe respiratory disease in humans. SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and lungs, which can lead to amplified chloride secretion and increased leak across epithelial barriers, contributing to severe pneumonia and consolidation of the lungs as seen in many COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular aspects that contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenesis and for the development of approaches to mitigate these damaging pathologies. The multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein contributes to virus assembly/egress, and as a membrane protein, also possesses viroporin channel properties that may contribute to epithelial barrier damage, pathogenesis, and disease severity. The extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of E also contains a putative PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), similar to that identified in the E protein of SARS-CoV-1. Here, we screened an array of GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins using either a biotin-labeled WT or mutant ECT peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Notably, we identified a singular specific interaction between the WT E peptide and the second PDZ domain of human Zona Occludens-1 (ZO1), one of the key regulators of TJ formation/integrity in all epithelial tissues. We used homogenous time resolve fluorescence (HTRF) as a second complementary approach to further validate this novel modular E-ZO1 interaction. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 E interacts with ZO1 in infected epithelial cells, and this interaction may contribute, in part, to tight junction damage and epithelial barrier compromise in these cell layers leading to enhanced virus spread and severe dysfunction that leads to morbidity. Prophylactic/therapeutic intervention targeting this virus-host interaction may effectively reduce airway and/or gastrointestinal barrier damage and mitigate virus spread."
https://openalex.org/W3170227737,"To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus.We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R0 from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0.We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors-population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality-as having strong relationships with R0, across countries. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R0 but were positive.Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics."

However, peak selection methods to calculate monomer-polymer conversion can vary, consequently affecting final results. Thus, the aim of this study is to experimentally confirm which method is less prone to systematic errors. Three commercial restorative materials were tested-Vertise Flow (VF), Constic and Activa Bioactive Restorative Kids. Firstly, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infra-Red (ATR-FTIR) (Spectrum One, Perkin-Elmer, UK) spectra of monomers were acquired-10-methacryloyloxy decyl dihydrogen phosphate (10-MDP), bisphenol-A glycidyl dimethacrylate (Bis-GMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), triethyelene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) to investigate proportionality of methacrylate peak heights versus concentration. Spectral changes upon light exposure of 2 mm discs of the restorative materials (irradiated for 20 s, LED curing unit 1100-1330 mW/cm2) were assessed to study polymerisation kinetics (n = 3), with continuous acquisition of spectra, before, during and after light exposure. Peak differences and degrees of conversion (DC %) were calculated using 1320/1336, 1320/1350 and 1636/1648 cm-1 as reaction/reference peaks. Inferential statistics included a MANOVA and within-subjects repeated measures ANOVA design (5% significance level). Proportionality of methacrylate peak height to concentration was confirmed, with the 1320/1352 cm-1 peak combination showing the lowest coefficient of variation (8%). Difference spectra of the polymerisation reaction showed noise interference around the 1500-1800 cm-1 region. Across the different materials, DC % results are highly dependent upon peak selection (p<0.001), with higher variability associated to the 1636 cm-1. Significant differences in the materials were only detected when the 1320 cm-1 peak was used (p<0.05). Within the same materials, methods were significantly different for Constic and Activa (p<0.05). It is possible to conclude that the 1320 cm-1 peak is more adequate to assess polymerisation of methacrylates and is therefore recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3167011972,"Coronaviruses play an important role as pathogens of humans and animals, and the emergence of epidemics like SARS, MERS and COVID-19 is closely linked to zoonotic transmission events primarily from wild animals. Bats have been found to be an important source of coronaviruses with some of them having the potential to infect humans, with other animals serving as intermediate or alternate hosts or reservoirs. Host diversity may be an important contributor to viral diversity and thus the potential for zoonotic events. To date, limited research has been done in Africa on this topic, in particular in the Congo Basin despite frequent contact between humans and wildlife in this region. We sampled and, using consensus coronavirus PCR-primers, tested 3,561 wild animals for coronavirus RNA. The focus was on bats (38%), rodents (38%), and primates (23%) that posed an elevated risk for contact with people, and we found coronavirus RNA in 121 animals, of which all but two were bats. Depending on the taxonomic family, bats were significantly more likely to be coronavirus RNA-positive when sampled either in the wet ( Pteropodidae and Rhinolophidae ) or dry season ( Hipposideridae , Miniopteridae , Molossidae , and Vespertilionidae ). The detected RNA sequences correspond to 15 alpha- and 6 betacoronaviruses, with some of them being very similar (&gt;95% nucleotide identities) to known coronaviruses and others being more unique and potentially representing novel viruses. In seven of the bats, we detected RNA most closely related to sequences of the human common cold coronaviruses 229E or NL63 (&gt;80% nucleotide identities). The findings highlight the potential for coronavirus spillover, especially in regions with a high diversity of bats and close human contact, and reinforces the need for ongoing surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W3168851130,"Multiple mutations have been described in the human GBA1 gene, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) that degrades glucosylceramide and is pivotal in glycosphingolipid substrate metabolism. Depletion of GCase, typically by homozygous mutations in GBA1, is linked to the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher's disease (GD) and distinct or heterozygous mutations in GBA1 are associated with increased Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. While numerous genes have been linked to heritable PD, GBA1 mutations in aggregate are the single greatest risk factor for development of idiopathic PD. The importance of GCase in PD necessitates preclinical models in which to study GCase-related mechanisms and novel therapeutic approaches, as well as to elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to enhanced PD risk in GBA1 mutation carriers. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a novel GBA1 mouse model and to facilitate wide accessibility of the model with phenotypic data. Herein we describe the results of molecular, biochemical, histological, and behavioral phenotyping analyses in a GBA1 D409V knock-in (KI) mouse. This mouse model exhibited significantly decreased GCase activity in liver and brain, with substantial increases in glycosphingolipid substrates in the liver. While no changes in the number of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra were noted, subtle changes in striatal neurotransmitters were observed in GBA1 D409V KI mice. Alpha-synuclein pathology and inflammation were not observed in the nigrostriatal system of this model. In summary, the GBA1 D409V KI mouse model provides an ideal model for studies aimed at pharmacodynamic assessments of potential therapies aiming to restore GCase."
https://openalex.org/W3170974991,"Poor menstrual hygiene practices influence school girls' dignity, well-being and health, school-absenteeism, academic performance, and school dropout in developing countries. Despite this, menstrual hygienic practices are not well understood and have not received proper attention by school WASH programs. Therefore, this study examined the extent of good menstrual hygiene practices and associated factors among high school girls in Dessie City, Amhara Region, northeastern Ethiopia.A school-based cross-sectional study was employed to examine 546 randomly selected high school students in Dessie City, northeastern Ethiopia. Pretested interviewer-administered questionnaires and a school observational checklist were used for data collection. EpiData Version 4.6 and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 25.0 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Bivariate and multivariable logistics regression analyses were employed to identify factors associated with good menstrual hygiene practices. During bivariable analysis, variables with P-values less than 0.25 were retained for multivariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, variables with a P-value less than 0.05 were declared to be significantly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices.Of the respondents, 53.9% (95% CI [49.6, 58.2]) reported good menstrual hygiene practices. The following factors were found to be significantly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices: age range 16-19 years (AOR = 1.93, 95% CI: [1.22-3.06]); school grade level 10 (AOR = 1.90, 95% CI: [1.18-3.07]); maternal education (primary) (AOR = 3.72, 95% CI: [1.81-7.63]), maternal education (secondary) (AOR = 8.54, 95% CI: [4.18-17.44]), maternal education (college) (AOR = 6.78, 95% CI: [3.28-14.02]) respectively]; having regular menses [AOR = 1.85, 95% CI: (1.03-3.32); good knowledge regarding menstruation (AOR = 2.02, 95% CI: [1.32-3.09]); discussing menstrual hygiene with friends (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI: [1.12-2.86]), and obtaining money for pads from the family (AOR = 2.08, 95% CI: [1.15-3.78]).We found that more than half of high school girls had good menstrual hygiene practices. Factors significantly associated with good menstrual hygiene practices include high school girls age 16-18 years, girls grade level 10, maternal education being completed primary, secondary and college level, having regular menses, good knowledge regarding menstruation, discussing menstrual hygiene with friends and obtaining money for pads from the family. Therefore, educating of high school student mothers about MHP should be a priority intervention area to eliminate the problem of menstrual hygiene among daughters. Furthermore, in order to improve the MHP among high school girls, further attention is needed to improving knowledge regarding menstruation among high school girls, encouraging high school girls' families to support their daughters by buying sanitary pads and promoting discussions among friends about menstrual hygiene. Schools need to focus on making the school environment conducive to managing menstrual hygiene by increasing awareness of safe MHP and providing adequate water/sanitation facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3166047078,"In sub-Saharan Africa growing season precipitation is affected by climate change. Due to this, in Cameroon, it is uncertain how some crops are vulnerable to growing season precipitation. Here, an assessment of the vulnerability of maize, millet, and rice to growing season precipitation is carried out at a national scale and validated at four sub-national scales/sites. The data collected were historical yield, precipitation, and adaptive capacity data for the period 1961-2019 for the national scale analysis and 1991-2016 for the sub-national scale analysis. The crop yield data were collected for maize, millet, and rice from FAOSTAT and the global yield gap atlas to assess the sensitivity both nationally and sub-nationally. Historical data on mean crop growing season and mean annul precipitation were collected from a collaborative database of UNDP/Oxford University and the climate portal of the World Bank to assess the exposure both nationally and sub-nationally. To assess adaptive capacity, literacy, and poverty rate proxies for both the national and regional scales were collected from KNOEMA and the African Development Bank. These data were analyzed using a vulnerability index that is based on sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity. The national scale results show that millet has the lowest vulnerability index while rice has the highest. An inverse relationship between vulnerability and adaptive capacity is observed. Rice has the lowest adaptive capacity and the highest vulnerability index. Sub-nationally, this work has shown that northern maize is the most vulnerable crop followed by western highland rice. This work underscores the fact that at different scales, crops are differentially vulnerable due to variations in precipitation, temperature, soils, access to farm inputs, exposure to crop pest and variations in literacy and poverty rates. Therefore, caution should be taken when transitioning from one scale to another to avoid generalization. Despite these differences, in the sub-national scale, western highland rice is observed as the second most vulnerable crop, an observation similar to the national scale observation."
https://openalex.org/W3168275210,"Physician wellness is vital to career satisfaction, provision of high quality patient care, and the successful education of the next generation of physicians. Despite this, the number of physicians experience symptoms of burnout is rising. To assess the impact of organizational culture on physicians' professional fulfillment and burnout, we surveyed full-time Department of Medicine members at the University of Toronto. A cross-sectional survey assessed: physician factors (age, gender, minority status, disability, desire to reduce clinical workload); workplace culture (efforts to create a collegial environment, respectful/civil interactions, confidence to address unprofessionalism without reprisal, witnessed and/or personally experienced unprofessionalism); professional fulfillment and burnout using the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index. We used multivariable linear regression to examine the relationship of measures of workplace culture on professional fulfillment and burnout (scores 0-10), controlling for physician factors. Of 419 respondents (52.0% response rate), we included 400 with complete professional fulfillment and burnout data in analyses (60% ≤ age 50, 45% female). Mean scores for professional fulfillment and burnout were 6.7±1.9 and 2.8±1.9, respectively. Controlling for physician factors, professional fulfillment was associated with satisfaction with efforts to create a collegial environment (adjusted beta 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.70) and agreement that colleagues were respectful/civil (adjusted beta 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.17). Lower professional fulfillment was associated with higher burnout scores. Controlling for professional fulfillment and physician factors, lower confidence in taking action to address unprofessionalism (adjusted beta -0.22, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.03) was associated with burnout. Organizational culture and physician factors had an impact on professional fulfillment and burnout. Professional fulfillment partially mediated the relationship between organizational culture and burnout. Strategies that promote inclusion, respect and civility, and safe ways to report workplace unprofessionalism are needed in academic medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3170800558,"This article presents new archaeological observations and multidisciplinary research from Dor, Israel to establish a more reliable relative sea level for the Carmel Coast and Southern Levant between the Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period (ca. 3500-1800 y BP). Our record indicates a period of low relative sea level, around -2.5 m below present, from the Middle Bronze Age to the Hellenistic period (ca. 3500-2200 y BP). This was followed by a rapid rise to present levels, starting in the Hellenistic period and concluding during the Roman period (ca. 2200-1800 y BP). These Roman levels agree with other relative sea-level indications from Israel and other tectonically stable areas in the Mediterranean. Several relative sea-level reconstruction models carried out in the current study provide different predictions due to their parameters and do not model the changes observed from field data which points to a non-isostatic origin for the changes. Long-term low stable Iron Age relative sea level can be seen in Dor, where Iron Age harbor structures remain around the same elevation between ca. 3100-2700 y BP. A similar pattern occurs at Atlit, the Iron Age harbor to the north used continuously from ca. 2900 y BP to the beginning of the Hellenistic period (ca. 2200 y BP). An examination of historical and archaeological sources reveals decline and occasional disappearance of Hellenistic sites along the coast of Israel at ca. 2200 y BP (2nd century BCE), as in the case of Yavneh Yam, Ashdod Yam, Straton's Tower, and tel Taninim. In Akko-Ptolemais, the large harbor installations built in the Hellenistic period were never replaced by a substantial Roman harbor. The conclusions of this research are thus relevant for the sea-level research community and for the historical analyses of the Israeli and South Levantine coastline."
https://openalex.org/W3166334654,"Tuberculosis (TB) in migrants is of concern to health authorities worldwide and is even more critical in Brazil, considering the country´s size and long land borders. The aim of the study was to identify critical areas in Brazil for migrants diagnosed with TB and to describe the temporal trend in this phenomenon in recent years.This is an ecological study that used spatial analysis and time series analysis. As the study population, all cases of migrants diagnosed with TB from 2014 to 2019 were included, and Brazilian municipalities were considered as the unit of ecological analysis. The Getis-Ord Gi* technique was applied to identify critical areas, and based on the identified clusters, seasonal-trend decomposition based on loess (STL) and Prais-Winsten autoregression were used, respectively, to trace and classify temporal trend in the analyzed series. In addition, several municipal socioeconomic indicators were selected to verify the association between the identified clusters and social vulnerability.2,471 TB cases were reported in migrants. Gi* analysis showed that areas with spatial association with TB in immigrants coincide with critical areas for TB in the general population (coast of the Southeast and North regions). Four TB clusters were identified in immigrants in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, with an upward trend in most of these clusters. The temporal trend in TB in immigrants was classified as increasing in Brazil (+ 60.66% per year [95% CI: 27.21-91.85]) and in the clusters in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, and Rio de Janeiro (+1.01, +2.15, and + 2.90% per year, respectively). The cluster in the state of São Paulo was the only one classified as stationary. The descriptive data on the municipalities belonging to the clusters showed evidence of the association between TB incidence and conditions of social vulnerability.The study revealed the critical situation of TB among migrants in the country. Based on the findings, health authorities might focus on actions in regions identified, stablishing an intensive monitoring and following up, ensuring that these cases concluded their treatment and avoiding that they could spread the disease to the other regions or scenarios. The population of migrants are very dynamic, therefore strategies for following up them across Brazil are really urgent to manage the tuberculosis among international migrants in an efficient and proper way."
https://openalex.org/W3168178416,"A variety of infectious diseases occur in mainland China every year. Cyclic oscillation is a widespread attribute of most viral human infections. Understanding the outbreak cycle of infectious diseases can be conducive for public health management and disease surveillance. In this study, we collected time-series data for 23 class B notifiable infectious diseases from 2004 to 2020 using public datasets from the National Health Commission of China. Oscillatory properties were explored using power spectrum analysis. We found that the 23 class B diseases from the dataset have obvious oscillatory patterns (seasonal or sporadic), which could be divided into three categories according to their oscillatory power in different frequencies each year. These diseases were found to have different preferred outbreak months and infection selectivity. Diseases that break out in autumn and winter are more selective. Furthermore, we calculated the oscillation power and the average number of infected cases of all 23 diseases in the first eight years (2004 to 2012) and the next eight years (2012 to 2020) since the update of the surveillance system. A strong positive correlation was found between the change of oscillation power and the change in the number of infected cases, which was consistent with the simulation results using a conceptual hybrid model. The establishment of reliable and effective analytical methods contributes to a better understanding of infectious diseases' oscillation cycle characteristics. Our research has certain guiding significance for the effective prevention and control of class B infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3167658986,"Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) in the inland waters of Washington were reduced by predator control programs in the twentieth century, but stocks have rebounded since being protected in the 1970s. Three management stocks are recognized, but there is little information on their current abundance. We conducted 38,431 km of aerial line-transect surveys throughout the range of these stocks in 2013-2016, sighting a total of 4,678 groups of harbor seals. Line-transect analysis with Beaufort sea state as a covariate provided estimates of the number of seals in the water. We then incorporated tagging data from 15 instrumented seals to develop correction factors, both for seals missed in the water while diving, and those that were on shore. Tagging data were modeled with generalized linear mixed models to provide estimates of the proportions diving and hauled out. After applying these correction factors, we estimated that the Hood Canal stock contained 1,368 seals (CV = 16.8%), the Southern Puget Sound stock contained 1,976 seals (CV = 20.5%), and the Washington Northern Inland Waters stock contained 7,513 seals (CV = 11.5%). This study presents a non-traditional approach to estimating the size of Washington inland waters harbor seal stocks, which may also be applicable to other species for which survey and tagging data are available."
https://openalex.org/W3169285365,"There is a growing number of older people living with HIV (OPLHIV). While a significant proportion of this population are adults growing into old age with HIV, there are also new infections among OPLHIV. There is a lack of data describing the outcomes of OPLHIV who commenced antiretroviral therapy (ART) after the age of 50 years in sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a cohort study of patients who enrolled in care at Newlands Clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe, at ages ≥50 years between February 2004 and March 2020. We examined demographic characteristics, attrition, viral suppression, immunological and clinical outcomes. Specifically, we described prevalent and incident HIV-related communicable and non-communicable comorbidities. We calculated frequencies, medians, interquartile ranges (IQR), and proportions; and used Cox proportional hazards models to identify risk factors associated with death. We included 420 (57% female) who commenced ART and were followed up for a median of 5.6 years (IQR 2.4-9.9). Most of the men were married (n = 152/179, 85%) whereas women were mostly widowed (n = 125/241, 51.9%). Forty per cent (n = 167) had WHO stage 3 or 4 conditions at ART baseline. Hypertension prevalence was 15% (n = 61) at baseline, and a further 27% (n = 112) had incident hypertension during follow-up. During follow-up, 300 (71%) were retained in care, 88 (21%) died, 17 (4%) were lost to follow-up, and 15 (4%) were transferred out. Of those in care, 283 (94%) had viral loads <50 copies/ml, and 10 had viral loads >1000 copies/ml. Seven patients (1.7%) were switched to second line ART during follow-up and none were switched to third-line. Higher baseline CD4 T-cell counts were protective against mortality (p = 0.001) while male sex (aHR: 2.29, 95%CI: 1.21-4.33), being unmarried (aHR: 2.06, 95%CI: 1.13-3.78), and being unemployed (aHR: 2.01, 95%CI: 1.2-3.37) were independent independent risk factors of mortality. There was high retention in care and virologic suppression in this cohort of OPLHIV. Hypertension was a common comorbidity. Being unmarried or unemployed were significant predictors of mortality highlighting the importance of sociologic factors among OPLHIV, while better immune competence at ART commencement was protective against mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3170386013,"Cynara cardunculus L. is a cardoon species native to the Mediterranean region, which is composed of three botanical taxa, each having distinct biological characteristics. The aim of this study was to examine wild populations of C. cardunculus established in Portugal, in order to determine their genetic diversity, geographic distribution, and population structure. Based on SSR markers, 121 individuals of C. cardunculus from 17 wild populations of the Portuguese Alentejo region were identified and analysed. Ten SSRs were found to be efficient markers in the genetic diversity analysis. The total number of alleles ranged from 9 to 17 per locus. The expected and observed means in heterozygosity, by population analysed, were 0.591 and 0.577, respectively. The wild population exhibited a high level of genetic diversity at the species level. The highest proportion of genetic variation was identified within a geographic group, while variation was lower among groups. Geographic areas having highest genetic diversity were identified in Alvito, Herdade da Abóboda, Herdade da Revilheira and Herdade de São Romão populations. Moreover, significant genetic differentiation existed between wild populations from North-Alentejo geographic locations (Arraiolos, Évora, Monte da Chaminé) and Centro Hortofrutícola, compared with other populations. This study reports genetic diversity among a representative number of wild populations and genotypes of C. cardunculus from Portugal.

https://openalex.org/W3167527991,"Bipolar Transurethral Enucleation of the Prostate (B-TUEP) is recommended as a first-choice treatment for benign prostatic obstruction in prostates >80 ml. Differently, B-TUEP is only considered as an alternative option after TURP for smaller prostates (30-80 ml). The aim of our study is to assess the relation between prostate size and surgical outcomes after B-TUEP.We performed a retrospective analysis of data collected from 172 patients submitted to B-TUEP. Patients were segregated according to tertiles of prostate volume (PV) (≤60 ml, 61-110 ml, >110 ml). For each group we evaluated enucleation efficacy (enucleated weight/enucleation time), complication rates, urinary and sexual function parameters. Functional and sexual parameters were compared between groups at baseline, 1 and 3 months follow up. Descriptive statistics and linear and logistic regression models tested the association between PV and postoperative complications/outcomes.Operative time and weight of enucleated adenomas increased along with prostate volumes (all p≤0.01). Enucleation efficacy was higher in men with PV >110 ml compared to other groups (p≤0.001). Length of hospital stay, catheterization time and rates of postoperative complications, such as transfusion and clot evacuation rates and bladder neck/urethral strictures, were comparable between groups. Urinary symptoms improved at 1-and 3-months in each group as compared to baseline evaluation (all p<0.01) but they did not differ according to PV. In each group maximum urinary flow and post-void residual volume significantly improved at 3 months compared to baseline (all p≤0.01), without differences according to PV. Sexual symptoms were similar between groups at each follow up assessment. At multivariable linear and logistic regression analysis, prostate volume was not associated with postoperative functional outcomes and complications. Conversely, patient's comorbid status and antiplatelet/anticoagulation use were independently associated with postoperative complications.According to our findings, B-TUEP should be considered a ""size independent procedure"" as it can provide symptom relief in men with prostates of all sizes with the same efficacy and safety profile."
https://openalex.org/W3168881195,"Cross-border transactions have been more and more popular around the world. However, the current cross-border transactions still have risks and challenges, e.g., differences in regulation policies and unbalanced profits of banks. To address this critical issue, we construct a new framework for the transaction system with the support of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a new consortium blockchain system, namely asymmetric consortium blockchain (ACB), to ensure the implementation of cross-border transactions. Different from traditional consortium blockchain, the new blockchain system could support the supernode to regulate all the transactions timely. Furthermore, the new smart contract is designed to lower the opportunity loss for each node and make the profits allocation system fairer. In the end, the numerical experiments were carried out based on the transactions of Shenzhen and Hong Kong. The results show that the proposed ACB system is efficient to make the profit allocation fairer for the participants and keep intelligent for the new cross-border transaction system."
https://openalex.org/W3172918829,"Drawing on Jakarta, Metro Manila and Singapore as case studies, we explore the paradox of slow political action in addressing subsiding land, particularly along high-density urban coastlines with empirical insights from coastal geography, geodesy analysis, geology, and urban planning. In framing land subsidence as a classic 'wicked' policy problem, and also as a hybrid geological and anthropogenic phenomenon that is unevenly experienced across urban contexts, the paper uses a three-step analysis. First, satellite-derived InSAR maps are integrated with Sentinel-1A data in order to reveal the socio-temporal variability of subsidence rates which in turn pose challenges in uniformly applying regulatory action. Second, a multi-sectoral mapping of diverse policies and practices spanning urban water supply, groundwater extraction, land use zoning, building codes, tenurial security, and land reclamation reveal the extent to which the broader coastal governance landscape remains fragmented and incongruous, particularly in arresting a multi-dimensional phenomenon such as subsidence. Finally, in reference to distinct coastal identities of each city-the 'Sinking Capital' (Jakarta), 'Fortress Singapore', and the 'Disaster Capital' (Manila) the paper illustrates how land subsidence is portrayed across the three metropolises in markedly similar ways: as a reversible, quasi-natural, and/or a highly individualized problem."
https://openalex.org/W3166567015,"The aim of this study is to analyze how isokinetic knee and hip peak torques and roundhouse kick velocities are related to expertise level (elite vs. sub-elite) in taekwondo athletes. Seven elite and seven sub-elite athletes were tested for kick-specific variables (KSV, composed of kinematic variables and power of impact) and for concentric isokinetic peak torque (PT) at 60°/s and 240°/s. First, KSVs and PTs were compared between groups, then PTs were correlated with KSVs. Parametric variables with larger effect sizes (Cohen's d) were entered in a stepwise linear discriminant analysis (LDA), generating an equation to estimate competitive level. Between-group differences were found in hip flexors (p = 0.04, d = 0.92) and extensors (p = 0.04, d = 0.96) with PT at 240°/s. Hip flexion PT at 60°/s and 240°/s correlated negatively with kick time (R = -0.46, p = 0.0499 and R = -0.62, p = 0.01 respectively). Hip flexion torque at 60°/s correlated positively (R = 0.52, p = 0.03) with peak linear velocity of the foot (LVF) and power of impact (R = 0.51, p = 0.03). Peak torque of hip extension at 60°/s and hip abduction at 240°/s also correlated with LVF (R = 0.56, p = 0.02 and R = 0.46, p = 0.0499). Hip extension at 60°/s correlated positively with peak linear velocity of the knee (R = 0.48, p = 0.04). The LDA showed an accuracy of 85.7% (p = 0.003) in predicting expertise level based on hip flexion and extension torques at 240°/s and on knee extension velocity during the kick. The study demonstrates that hip muscle strength is probably the dominant muscular factor for determining kick performance. Knee angular velocity combined with hip torques is the best discriminator for competitive level in taekwondo athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3168375008,"Understanding the influence of individual attributes on demographic processes is a key objective of wildlife population studies. Capture-recapture and age data are commonly collected to investigate hypotheses about survival, reproduction, and viability. We present a novel age-structured Jolly-Seber model that incorporates age and capture-recapture data to provide comprehensive information on population dynamics, including abundance, age-dependent survival, recruitment, age structure, and population growth rates. We applied our model to a multi-year capture-recapture study of polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ) in western Hudson Bay, Canada (2012–2018), where management and conservation require a detailed understanding of how polar bears respond to climate change and other factors. In simulation studies, the age-structured Jolly-Seber model improved precision of survival, recruitment, and annual abundance estimates relative to standard Jolly-Seber models that omit age information. Furthermore, incorporating age information improved precision of population growth rates, increased power to detect trends in abundance, and allowed direct estimation of age-dependent survival and changes in annual age structure. Our case study provided detailed evidence for senescence in polar bear survival. Median survival estimates were lower (&lt;0.95) for individuals aged &lt;5 years, remained high (&gt;0.95) for individuals aged 7–22 years, and subsequently declined to near zero for individuals &gt;30 years. We also detected cascading effects of large recruitment classes on population age structure, which created major shifts in age structure when these classes entered the population and then again when they reached prime breeding ages (10–15 years old). Overall, age-structured Jolly-Seber models provide a flexible means to investigate ecological and evolutionary processes that shape populations (e.g., via senescence, life expectancy, and lifetime reproductive success) while improving our ability to investigate population dynamics and forecast population changes from capture-recapture data."

This study examined if hedonic hunger reduced during a behavioural weight management programme, and if hedonic hunger predicted future BMI.Participants were 594 community-dwelling, UK-based adults(396 female; age 56.43 years, s.d. = 12.50, range 20-83 years); 490 participants (82.5%) had obesity. Participants were randomised to a 12- or 52-week behavioural weight management intervention (WW12 or WW52, respectively) or a brief self-help intervention (BI). Relationships between hedonic hunger and BMI over 24 months (baseline, 3, 12, 24 months) were analysed using an autoregressive cross-lagged model.Hedonic hunger scores decreased from 2.71 (s.d. = .91) at baseline to 2.41 (s.d. = .88) at 3 months (p < .001, CI .22 to .38), remained reduced to 24 months, and were not affected by intervention arm at any time point (p's>.05). Baseline hedonic hunger scores predicted 3-month scores (B = .76, SE = .03, p < .001, CI .71 to .82), 3-month scores predicted 12-month scores (B = .76, SE = .03, p < .001 CI .72 to .80), and 12-month scores predicted 24-month scores (B = .72, SE = .03, p < .001, CI .64 to .77). Higher hedonic hunger at 3 months predicted higher BMI at 12 months (B = .04, SE = .02, p = .03, CI .01 to .07) but not at 24 months (p>.05). BMI at 12 months was lower in WW52 30.87kg/m2, s.d. = 5.02) than WW12 (32.12 kg/m2, s.d. = 5.58, p = .02, CI .16 to 2.34) and BI (32.74 kg/m2, s.d. = 4.15, p = .01, CI .30 to 3.45). BMI was not affected by intervention at any other time point (p's>.05).Hedonic hunger reduced during weight management irrespective of intervention. Early reductions in hedonic hunger appear to be associated with lower BMI in the medium-term. Identifying ways to reduce hedonic hunger during weight loss could aid weight management for some people."
https://openalex.org/W3170338830,"This study aims to investigate the correlation between spinopelvic parameters in supine position (pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT), lumbar lordosis (LL)), disc degeneration and herniation of the thoracolumbar spine, as well as cardiovascular risk factors and back pain in a southern German cohort from the general population.This study is a cross-sectional, case-control study drawn from a prospective cohort of the ""Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg/Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg"" study (KORA). In total, 374 participants (mean age 56.4 ± 9.2 years; 57.8% male) from the whole-body MRI cohort (FF4) were included. All participants underwent a standardized whole-body MRI on which disc degeneration of the thoracic and lumbar spine was evaluated using a sequence adapted Pfirrmann score. PI, PT, SS and LL were measured according to the description in the literature, using sagittal imaging. Furthermore, disc bulging and protrusion were assessed. Correlations were estimated by logistic regression models providing odds ratios.Mean PI was 54.0° ± 11.1°, PT 13.0° ± 5.8°, SS 40.2° ± 8.8° and LL 36.2° ± 9.6°. SS was greater in men (p<0.05) and lumbar lordosis in women (p<0.001). PT increased by 0.09° per age-year with rising age. Age was not associated with PI, SS and LL. Neither BMI, hypertension, cholesterol, lipid levels, nor physical activity were associated with PI, PT, SS or LL. Diabetes mellitus negatively correlated with SS (β = -4.19; 95%CI -7.31-1.06, p<0.01). Smaller spinopelvic parameters (PI, SS and LL) where significantly (p<0.05) correlated with an increased frequency of disc bulging, as well as a local clustering in the lumbar, but not the thoracic spine.In conclusion, spinopelvic parameters, measured in supine position, are significantly correlated with disc bulging alone; there is no significant correlation between supine spinopelvic parameters and disc degeneration, back pain or cardiovascular risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3171347269,"Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) living with HIV face unique challenges and have poorer health outcomes than adults with HIV. Project YES! was a youth-led initiative to promote HIV self-management and reduce stigma among AYAs in four Ndola, Zambia clinics. Clinic health care providers (HCPs) were involved in multiple intervention aspects, including serving as expert resources during AYA and caregiver group meetings, facilitating resistance test-based AYA antiretroviral drug changes, meeting with participants referred through a safety protocol, and guiding a subset of participants' physical transition from pediatric to adult clinic settings. This study aimed to understand HCP insights on facilitators and barriers to implementing Project YES! and scaling up a clinic-based, youth-focused program.A trained interviewer conducted ten in-depth interviews with participating HCPs from November-December 2018 and analyzed data, identifying key themes. These themes were examined in terms of two implementation science outcomes-acceptability and feasibility-to inform scalability.HCPs found peer mentoring valuable for AYAs with HIV and the bimonthly caregiver meetings beneficial to AYA caregivers. HCPs voiced a desire for more involvement in specific processes related to patient clinical care, such as drug changes. HCPs' experiences with the study safety protocol, including referrals for youth experiences of violence, shifted their views of AYAs and informed their understanding of key issues youth face. Considering this, many HCPs requested more resources to support AYAs' varied needs. HCPs noted limited time and clinic space as implementation barriers but felt the program was valuable overall.HCPs concluded youth peer mentoring was highly acceptable and feasible, supporting scale-up of youth-led interventions addressing the multi-faceted needs of AYAs living with HIV. Continued provider involvement in resistance test-based antiretroviral drug changes, considered in the context of health system and clinic policy, would enhance long-term success of the program at scale."
https://openalex.org/W3172990968,"Our aim was to present the experience of systematic, routine use of next generation sequencing (NGS) in clinical diagnostics of myopathies.Exome sequencing was performed on patients with high risk for inherited myopathy, which were selected based on the history of the disease, family history, clinical presentation, and diagnostic workup. Exome target capture was performed, followed by sequencing on HiSeq 2500 or MiSeq platforms. Data analysis was performed using internally developed bioinformatic pipeline.The study comprised 86 patients, including 22 paediatric cases (26%). The largest group were patients referred with an unspecified myopathy (47%), due to non-specific or incomplete clinical and laboratory findings, followed by congenital myopathies (22%) and muscular dystrophies (22%), congenital myotonias (6%), and mitochondrial myopathies (3%). Altogether, a diagnostic yield was 52%; a high diagnostic rate was present in paediatric patients (64%), while in patients with unspecified myopathies the rate was 35%. We found 51 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 23 genes and two pathogenic copy number variations.Our results provide evidence that phenotype driven exome analysis diagnostic approach facilitates the diagnostic rate of complex, heterogeneous disorders, such as myopathies, particularly in paediatric patients and patients with unspecified myopathies."
https://openalex.org/W3167053911,"The structural validity and reliability of the Short-Form Health Survey 12 (SF-12) has not yet been tested in adults with the Marfan syndrome (MFS). This gap could undermine an evidence-grounded practice and research, especially considering that the need to assess health-related quality of life in patients with MFS has increased due to the improved life expectancy of these patients and the need to identify their determinants of quality of life. For this reason, this study aimed to confirm the dimensionality (structural validity) of the SF-12, its concurrent validity, and its reliability (internal consistency).We performed a cross-sectional study in a convenience sample of 111 Italian adults with MFS, collecting anamnestic and socio-demographic information, the SF-12, and short-form Health Survey 36 (SF-36). A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to verify whether the items of SF-12 related to physical restrictions, physical functioning, and bodily pain were retained by the physical summary component of the SF-12. The items referred to the role limitations due to emotional issues, social functioning, and mental health were retained by the mental summary component (MCS12). SF-36 was used to assess the concurrent validity of SF-12, hypothesizing positive correlations among the equivalent summary scores.The two-factor structural solution resulted in fitting the sample statistics adequately. The internal consistency was adequate for the two factors. Furthermore, the physical and mental summary scores of the SF-36 were positively correlated with their equivalent summary scores derived from the SF-12.This study confirmed the factor structure of the SF-12. Therefore, the use of SF-12 in clinical practice and research for assessing the health-related quality of life among adults with MFS is evidence-grounded. Future research is recommended to determine whether the SF-12 shows measurement invariance in different national contexts and determine eventual demographic variation in the SF-12 scores among patients with MFS."
https://openalex.org/W3167155456,"Background The association between girl child marriage and education is widely acknowledged; however, there is no large body of demographic studies from Zimbabwe that have addressed this aspect. This study aimed to examine the extent to which child marriage affects one academic milestone, i.e. completion of the Ordinary Level, the first cycle of high school, which is also the most critical indicator of educational achievement in Zimbabwe. Methods We used the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey and extracted 2380 cases of ever-married women aged between 20–29 years. We applied a propensity score-based method, which allowed us to mimic a hypothetical experiment and estimate outcomes between treated and untreated subjects. Results Our results suggest that child age at first marriage is concentrated between the ages of 15–22, with the typical age at first marriage being 18 years. Both logistic regression and PSM models revealed that early marriage decreased the chances of completing the first cycle of high school. Regression adjustment produced an estimate of prevalence ratio (PR) of 0.446 (95% CI: 0.374–0.532), while PSM resulted in an estimate (PR = 0.381; 95% CI: 0.298–0.488). Conclusion These results have implications for Zimbabwe’s development policy and suggest that girl-child marriage is a significant barrier to educational attainment. If not addressed, the country will most likely fail to meet sustainable development Goal 4.2 and 5.3. Social change interventions that target adults and counter beliefs about adolescent sexuality and prepubescent marriage should be put in place. Moreover, interventions that keep teenage girls in school beyond the first cycle of high school should be prioritised."
https://openalex.org/W3167688782,"Cigarette smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity are conventional risk factors (RFs) for coronary artery disease (CAD). Population trends for these RFs have varied in recent decades. Consequently, the risk factor profile for patients presenting with a new diagnosis of CAD in contemporary practice remains unknown.To examine the prevalence of RFs and their temporal trends among patients without a history of myocardial infarction or revascularization who underwent their first percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).We examined the prevalence and temporal trends of RFs among patients without a history of prior myocardial infarction, PCI, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery who underwent PCI at 47 non-federal hospitals in Michigan between 1/1/2010 and 3/31/2018.Of 69,571 men and 38,930 women in the study cohort, 95.5% of patients had 1 or more RFs and nearly half (55.2% of women and 48.7% of men) had ≥3 RFs. The gap in the mean age at the time of presentation between men and women narrowed as the number of RFs increased with a gap of 6 years among those with 2 RFs to <1 year among those with 5 RFs. Compared with patients without a current/recent history of smoking, those with a current/recent history of smoking presented a decade earlier (age 56.8 versus 66.9 years; p <0.0001). Compared with patients without obesity, patients with obesity presented 4.0 years earlier (age 61.4 years versus 65.4 years; p <0.0001).Modifiable RFs are widely prevalent among patients undergoing their first PCI. Smoking and obesity are associated with an earlier age of presentation. Population-level interventions aimed at preventing obesity and smoking could significantly delay the onset of CAD and the need for PCI."
https://openalex.org/W3167814578,"Across several decades there has been an unprecedented increase in immigration enforcement including detention and deportation. Immigration detention profoundly impacts those experiencing detention and their family members. An emerging area of research has found that immigrants experience a number of challenges which constrain and limit their decisions, choices, and options for security and integration in the United States due to social, political and structural determinants. These determinants lead to greater structural vulnerabilities among immigrants. The purpose of the current study was to illuminate the perceived vulnerabilities of detained noncitizen immigrants as they are raised and described while attending case hearings at the Bloomington, Minnesota immigration court. Through conducting a thematic analysis of notes derived from third party immigration court observers, three areas of perceived vulnerability were identified. These perceived vulnerabilities include 1) migration and motivations to migrate, 2) structural vulnerabilities (e.g., discrimination, financial insecurity, social ties and family support, stable or fixed residence, English language proficiency, health and mental health) in the US, and 3) challenges in navigating immigration detention. These findings demonstrate that noncitizen immigrants who are undergoing immigration detention are experiencing multiple intersecting vulnerabilities which profoundly impact their lives. Collaborative efforts across sectors are needed to work towards comprehensive immigration reforms including both short-term and long-term solutions to address pressing issues for noncitizens undergoing immigration detention."
https://openalex.org/W3168763930,"Background Childhood food insecurity has been associated with prevalent asthma in cross-sectional studies. Little is known about the relationship between food insecurity and incident asthma. Methods We used administrative databases linked with the Canadian Community Health Survey, to conduct a retrospective cohort study of children &lt;18 years in Ontario, Canada. Children without a previous diagnosis of asthma who had a household response to the Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) were followed until March 31, 2018 for new asthma diagnoses using a validated administrative coding algorithm. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between food insecurity and incident asthma, and adjusted models sequentially for clinical and clinical/socioeconomic risk factors. As additional analyses, we examined associations by HFSSM respondent type, severity of food insecurity, and age of asthma diagnosis. Moreover, we assessed for interaction between food security and child’s sex, household smoking status, and maternal asthma on the risk of incident asthma. Results Among the 27,746 included children, 5.1% lived in food insecure households. Over a median of 8.34 years, the incidence of asthma was 7.33/1000 person-years (PY) among food insecure children and 5.91/1000 PY among food secure children (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.54, p = 0.051). In adjusted analyses associations were similar (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.47, p = 0.24 adjusted for clinical risk factors, HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.60, p = 0.09 adjusted for clinical/socioeconomic factors). Associations did not qualitatively change by HFSSM respondent type, severity of food insecurity, and age of asthma diagnosis. There was no evidence of interaction in our models. Conclusions Food insecure children have numerous medical and social challenges. However, in this large population-based study, we did not observe that childhood food insecurity was associated with an increased risk of incident asthma when adjusted for important clinical and socioeconomic confounders."
https://openalex.org/W3169224623,"Some Pyropia species, such as nori (P. yezoensis), are important marine crops. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 39 samples of Pyropia species grown in Japan using organellar genome sequences. A comparison of the chloroplast DNA sequences with those from China showed a clear genetic separation between Japanese and Chinese P. yezoensis. Conversely, comparing the mitochondrial DNA sequences did not separate Japanese and Chinese P. yezoensis. Analysis of organellar genomes showed that the genetic diversity of Japanese P. yezoensis used in this study is lower than that of Chinese wild P. yezoensis. To analyze the genetic relationships between samples of Japanese Pyropia, we used whole-genome resequencing to analyze their nuclear genomes. In the offspring resulting from cross-breeding between P. yezoensis and P. tenera, nearly 90% of the genotypes analyzed by mapping were explained by the presence of different chromosomes originating from two different parental species. Although the genetic diversity of Japanese P. yezoensis is low, analysis of nuclear genomes genetically separated each sample. Samples isolated from the sea were often genetically similar to those being farmed. Study of genetic heterogeneity of samples within a single aquaculture strain of P. yezoensis showed that samples were divided into two groups and the samples with frequent abnormal budding formed a single, genetically similar group. The results of this study will be useful for breeding and the conservation of Pyropia species."

In the present study, we investigated factors associated with the desire for more children among married men and women in Niger.We utilised data from the 2012 Niger Demographic and Health Survey. The outcome variable for the study was fertility intentions. The data were analysed with Stata version 14.0. Both descriptive (frequencies and percentages) and inferential (binary logistic regression) analyses were carried out.Desire for more children was 97.2% and 87.2% among men and women respectively. Women aged 45-49 were less likely to desire more children, compared to those aged 25-39 [aOR = 0.13, CI = 0.11-0.16]. The odds of desire for more children were high in rural areas, compared to urban areas [aOR = 1.61, CI = 1.20-2.17]. Childbearing women with seven or more births were less likely to desire more children, compared to those with 1-3 births [aOR = 0.09, CI = 0.06-0.14]. Men aged 50-59 were less likely to desire more children, compared to those aged 25-39 [aOR = 0.13, CI = 0.05-0.35]. Men with secondary/higher level of education were less likely to desire more children, compared to those with no formal education [aOR = 0.24, CI = 0.11-0.52]. Childbearing men with seven or more births were less likely to desire more children, compared to those with 1-3 births [aOR = 0.06, CI = 0.01-0.30].This study shows high fertility desire among men and women in Niger. However, the prevalence of fertility desire among men is higher than that of women. A number of socio-economic and demographic factors were found to be associated with desire for more children among men and women in Niger. This calls for a collective effort to educate women and men in Niger on the negative consequences of rapid population growth and large family sizes."
https://openalex.org/W3171683637,"Living tetrapods owe their existence to a critical moment 360-340 million years ago when their ancestors walked on land. Vertebrae are central to locomotion, yet systematic testing of correlations between vertebral form and terrestriality and subsequent reinvasions of aquatic habitats is lacking, obscuring our understanding of movement capabilities in early tetrapods. Here, we quantified vertebral shape across a diverse group of Paleozoic amphibians (Temnospondyli) encompassing different habitats and nearly the full range of early tetrapod vertebral shapes. We demonstrate that temnospondyls were likely ancestrally terrestrial and had several early reinvasions of aquatic habitats. We find a greater diversity in temnospondyl vertebrae than previously known. We also overturn long-held hypotheses centered on weight-bearing, showing that neural arch features, including muscle attachment, were plastic across the water-land divide and do not provide a clear signal of habitat preferences. In contrast, intercentra traits were critical, with temnospondyls repeatedly converging on distinct forms in terrestrial and aquatic taxa, with little overlap between. Through our geometric morphometric study, we have been able to document associations between vertebral shape and environmental preferences in Paleozoic tetrapods and to reveal morphological constraints imposed by vertebrae to locomotion, independent of ancestry."
https://openalex.org/W3168137192,"In modern warfare, the comprehensiveness of combat domain and the complexity of tasks pose great challenges to operational coordination.To address this challenge, we use the improved triangular fuzzy number to express the combat mission time, first present a new multi-objective operational cooperative time scheduling model that takes the fluctuation of combat coordinative time and the time flexibility between each task into account. The resulting model is essentially a large-scale multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, intractably complicated to solve optimally. We next propose multi-objective improved Bat algorithm based on angle decomposition (MOIBA/AD) to quickly identify high-quality solutions to the model. Our proposed algorithm improves the decomposition strategy by replacing the planar space with the angle space, which helps greatly reduce the difficulty of processing evolutionary individuals and hence the time complexity of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Moreover, the population replacement strategy is enhanced utilizing the improved bat algorithm, which helps evolutionary individuals avoid getting trapped in local optima. Computational experiments on multi-objective operational cooperative time scheduling (MOOCTS) problems of different scales demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over four state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), including multi-objective bat Algorithm (MOBA), MOEA/D, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm version II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO). Our proposed method performs better in terms of four performance criteria, producing solutions of higher quality while keeping a better distribution of the Pareto solution set."

Baseline measurements assessed mothers' coping and problem-solving skills, depression, and parental stress before random assignment to intervention or control groups (n = 32 each). Problem-solving skills intervention was delivered through 6 monthly sessions, when babies attended for routine penicillin prophylaxis. All measurements were repeated for both groups at the end of the intervention period. Intention to treat analysis used repeated measures mixed models with the restricted estimation maximum likelihood approach.The problem-solving intervention had no significant effect on mothers' problem-solving skills (adjusted treatment effect: -1.69 points (95% CI:-5.62 to 2.25)), coping behaviours (adjusted treatment effect: 0.65 points (95% CI:- -7.13 to 8.41)) or depressive symptoms (adjusted treatment effect: -0.41 (95% CI: -6.00 to 5.19)). It reduced mothers' level of difficulty in managing stressful events by 9.5 points (95% CI (-16.86 to -2.16); effect size: 0.21 SD). In the subgroup of mothers at risk of depression (n = 31 at baseline), the intervention reduced depression scores with treatment effect of 10.4 points (95%CI: -18.83 to -1.88; effect size: 0.67 SD).This problem-solving skills intervention study suggests feasibility and possible efficacy in improving some maternal outcomes. Further refinement and culturally appropriate adaptations of the intervention could lead to stronger effects."
https://openalex.org/W3168328503,"A singular focus on maternal health at the time of a pregnancy leaves much about perinatal mortality unexplained, especially when there is growing evidence for maternal early life effects. Further, lumping stillbirth and early neonatal death into a single category of perinatal mortality may obscure different causes and thus different avenues of screening and prevention. The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus), a litter-bearing nonhuman primate, is an ideal species in which to study the independent effects of a mother's early life and adult phenotypes on pregnancy outcomes. We tested two hypotheses in 59 marmoset pregnancies at the Southwest National Primate Research Center and the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies. We explored 1) whether pregnancy outcomes were predicted independently by maternal adult weight versus maternal litter size and birth weight, and 2) whether stillbirth and early neonatal death were differentially predicted by maternal variables. No maternal characteristics predicted stillbirth and no maternal adult characteristics predicted early neonatal death. In univariate Poisson models, triplet-born females had a significantly increased rate of early neonatal death (IRR[se] = 3.00[1.29], p = 0.011), while higher birth weight females had a decreased rate (IRR[se] = 0.89[0.05], p = 0.039). In multivariate Poisson models, maternal litter size remained an independent predictor, explaining 13% of the variance in early neonatal death. We found that the later in the first week those neonates died, the more weight they lost. Together these findings suggest that triplet-born and low birth weight females have distinct developmental trajectories underlying greater rates of infant loss, losses that we suggest may be attributable to developmental disruption of infant feeding and carrying. Our findings of early life contributions to adult pregnancy outcomes in the common marmoset disrupt mother-blaming narratives of pregnancy outcomes in humans. These narratives hold that the pregnant person is solely responsible for pregnancy outcomes and the health of their children, independent of socioecological factors, a moralistic framing that has shaped clinical pregnancy management. It is necessary to differentiate temporal trajectories and causes of perinatal loss and view them as embedded in external processes to develop screening, diagnostic, and treatment tools that consider the full arc of a mother's lived experience, from womb to womb and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3169832716,"Illness perceptions form a key part of common-sense models which are used widely to explain variations in patient behaviours in healthcare. Despite the pervasiveness of depressive disorders worldwide and in young adults, illness perceptions of depressive disorders have not yet been well understood. Moreover, while a high proportion of cases of depressive disorders reside in South-east Asia, few have explored illness perceptions that are culturally relevant to this region. To address these limitations, this study aimed to understand illness perceptions of young adults diagnosed with depressive disorders. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted among Chinese, Malay, and Indian young adults aged 20 to 35 years old, who were seeking treatment at a psychiatric hospital. Data reached saturation after 33 interviews (10 to 12 interviews per ethnic group) and five themes emerged from the thematic analysis: 1) A reduced state of being experienced at a point of goal disengagement, 2) the accumulation of chronic stressors in a system that demands success and discourages the pursuit of personally meaningful goals, 3) a wide range of symptoms that are uncontrollable and disabling, 4) poor decision making resulting in wasted opportunities, with some positive takeaways, and 5) accepting the chronicity of depression. Young adults typically experienced depression as a reduced state of being and it was thought of cognitively as an entity that may be a part of or separate from the self. Over and beyond these aspects of cognitive representations was the emergence of themes depicting conflicts and dilemmas between the self and the social environment that threatened self-identity and autonomy. Addressing these conflicts in therapy would therefore be of utmost relevance for young adults recovering from depressive disorders in the local setting."

Serum antibody titers against each strain of 2018 Southern Hemisphere inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (IIV3) were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay on Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 28 (one month post-vaccination) serum samples. Geometric mean titer (GMT), GMT ratio (GMR), seroconversion (defined as ≥4 fold increase in HI titer), and seroprotection (i.e. HI titer ≥1:40) were compared across the study groups using multilevel regression analyses, controlling for previous year vaccination from medical records and baseline antibody levels.A total of 132 participants were enrolled in the study (33 in each of the four study groups). The baseline GMTs for influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B vaccine strains were not significantly different among all four groups (all p-values >0.05). After one month, both vaccinated groups had significantly higher GMT, GMR, seroconversion, and seroprotection than their unvaccinated controls (all p-values <0.05). The seroconversion rate was over 60% for any strain among the vaccinated groups, with the highest (88.8%) observed against A(H1N1) in the vaccinated pregnant group. Similarly, at least 75% of the vaccinated participants developed seroprotective antibody levels against all three strains; the highest seroprotection was found against A(H3N2) at 92.6% among vaccinated non-pregnant participants. Antibody responses (post-vaccination GMT, GMR, seroconversion, and seroprotection) were not significantly different between pregnant and non-pregnant women for all three strains of IIV3 (all p>0.05).The 2018 seasonal IIV3 was immunogenic against all three vaccine strains and pregnancy did not seem to alter the immune response to IIV3. These findings support the current influenza vaccination recommendations for pregnant women."

Recurrence was the only risk factor in group H was significantly higher in group L (HR 2.008, 95% CI, 1.123-3.589, P = 0.019). Mortality was similar to recurrence (HR 1.975, 95% CI 1.091-3.523, P = 0.044).Among patients with low-risk stage IIA colon cancer, recurrence and mortality rates were higher when perioperative serum CEA levels were above a certain level. Therefore, high CEA level should be considered a high-risk feature and adjuvant chemotherapy should be performed."
https://openalex.org/W3166882521,"The rate of maternal deaths in remote areas in eastern Indonesia-where geographic conditions are difficult and the standard of infrastructure is poor-is high. Long travel times needed to reach emergency obstetric care (EMOC) is one cause of maternal death. District governments in eastern Indonesia need effective planning to improve access to EMOC. The aim of this study was to develop a scenario modelling tool to be used in planning to improve access to EMOC in eastern Indonesia. The scenario model was developed using the geographic information system tool in NetLogo. This model has two inputs: the location of the EMOC facility (PONED) and the travel cost of moving across geographical features in the rainy and dry seasons. We added a cost-benefit analysis to the model: cost is the budget for building the infrastructure; benefit is the number of people who can travel to the EMOC in less than 1 hour if the planned infrastructure is built. We introduced the tool to representative midwives from all districts of Nusa Tenggara Timur province and to staff of Kupang district planning agency. We found that the tool can model accessibility to EMOC based on weather conditions; compare alternative infrastructure planning scenarios based on cost-benefit analysis; enable users to identify and mark poor infrastructure; and model travel across the ocean. Lay people can easily use the tool through interactive scenario modelling: midwives can use it for evidence to support planning proposals to improve access to EMOC in their district; district planning agencies can use it to choose the best plan to improve access to EMOC. Scenario modelling has potential for use in evidence-based planning to improve access to EMOC in low-income and lower-middle-income countries with poor infrastructure, difficult geography conditions, limited budgets and lack of trained personnel."
https://openalex.org/W3167763755,"The use of agro-biotechnology has raised consumer concerns about environmental, health, socio-economic and ethical risks. This study examines how regulatory policies regarding genetically modified (GM) food production affect consumers' cognitive information processing, in terms of perceived risk, self-control, and risk responsibility. There is further analysis of whether the effect of policy design is moderated by risk type. Data was generated in a field experiment (n = 547), including four different policy scenario treatments (banned, research and development, import, and full commercialization). The results reveal that policy scenarios where GM food is available on the market are associated with higher levels of perceived risk and lower levels of self-control compared with policies where GM food is banned. There was no evidence of policy scenarios affecting consumer willingness to assign personal risk responsibility. However, among participants who indicated health risks as their main concern, there was an effect from the policy scenario on self-risk responsibility as mediated through perceived risk and self-control. The results suggest that health-conscious consumers tend to attribute less responsibility to themselves in situations where a genetically modified product was commercialized. These findings indicate a need to clarify guideline recommendations for health-related risks associated with foods derived from biotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W3168600794,"Before generating radiotherapy plans for breast cancer patients, the choice of plan techniques (three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)) should be made. This study investigated the performance of two geometric indices in aiding the choice of 3D-CRT and VMAT plans in women undergoing left-sided whole breast radiotherapy.119 patients, previously treated with left-sided breast radiotherapy (61 3D-CRT treatments and 58 VMAT treatments) from a single institution, were retrospectively studied. Two geometric indices, which were cardiac junction (CJ) index and pulmonary junction (PJ) index, were defined and the relationship between these indices and dose of organs at risk (OARs) were evaluated. Two-tailed Student's t-test was performed to compare patient characteristics between 3D-CRT and VMAT. Linear regressions were calculated to investigate the association between geometric indices and absorbed dose of heart and left lung, including mean dose of heart (MHD), V5, V30 of heart, and mean dose of left lung (MLLD), V5, V10, V20, V30, V40 of left lung.The CJ index was strongly correlated with the MHD in 3D-CRT group and VMAT group. The linear regression formulas were MHD = 4826.59 ×CJ Index+310.48 (R = 0.857, F = 163.77, P = 0.000) in 3D-CRT plans and MHD = 1789.29×CJ Index+437.50 (R = 0.45, F = 14.23, P = 0.000) in VMAT plans. The intersection of the two formulas was CJ index = 4.2% and MHD = 512.33 cGy. The PJ index demonstrated a strongly positive correlation with MLLD in 3D-CRT group and VMAT group as well. The linear regression formulas were MLLD = 2879.54×PJ Index+999.79 (R = 0.697, F = 55.86, P = 0.000) in 3D-CRT plans and MLLD = 1411.79×PJ Index+1091.88 (R = 0.676, F = 47.11, P = 0.000) in VMAT plans, the intersection of the two formulas was PJ index = 6.3% and MLLD = 1180.46 cGy.CJ index and PJ index could be used as a practical tool to select 3D-CRT or VMAT before generating plans. We recommend that VMAT plan is preferable when CJ index is greater than 4.2% and/or PJ index is greater than 14.6%, while 3D-CRT plan is the first choice in the opposite."
https://openalex.org/W3169257017,"Animals regularly use social information to make fitness-relevant decisions. Particularly in social interactions, social information can reduce uncertainty about the relative quality of conspecifics, thus optimising decisions on with whom and how to interact. One important resource for individuals living in social environments is the production of information by signalling conspecifics. Recent research has suggested that some species of parrots engage in affiliative contact call matching and that these interactions may be available to conspecific unintended receivers. However, it remains unclear what information third parties may gain from contact call matching and how it can be utilised during flock decisions. Here, using a combined choice and playback experiment, we investigated the flock fusion choices and vocal behaviour of a social parrot species, the orange-fronted conure (Eupsittula canicularis), to a contact call matching interaction between two individuals of different sexes and with different vocal roles. Our results revealed that orange-fronted conures chose to follow vocal leaders more often than vocal followers during fusions. Furthermore, flocks responded with higher call rates and matched the stimulus calls closer when subsequently choosing a vocal leader. Interestingly, orange-fronted conures also showed higher contact call rates and closer matches when choosing males over females. These results suggest that paying attention to conspecific contact call interactions can provide individuals with social information that can be utilised during fission and fusion events, significantly influencing the social dynamics of orange-fronted conures."
https://openalex.org/W3169595347,"This study combined a social network analysis and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to test for general patterns of contagious spread of a mycobacterial infection for which pathways of disease acquisition are not well understood. Our population included 275 cases diagnosed with avian mycobacteriosis that were nested in a source population of 16,430 birds at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance facilities from 1992 through mid-2014. Mycobacteria species were determined using conventional methods and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Mycobacterium avium avium (MAA) and Mycobacterium genavense were the most common species of mycobacteria identified and were present in different proportions across bird taxa. A social network for the birds was constructed from the source population to identify directly and indirectly connected cases during time periods relevant to disease transmission. Associations between network connectivity and genetic similarity of mycobacteria (as determined by clusters of genotypes separated by few single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) were then evaluated in observed and randomly generated network permutations. Findings showed that some genotypes clustered along pathways of bird connectivity, while others were dispersed throughout the network. The proportion of directly connected birds having a similar mycobacterial genotype was 0.36 and significant (p&lt;0.05). This proportion was higher (0.58) and significant for MAA but not for M . genavense . Evaluations of SNP distributions also showed genotypes of MAA were more related in connected birds than expected by chance; however, no significant patterns of genetic relatedness were identified for M . genavense , although data were sparse. Integrating the WGS analysis of mycobacteria with a social network analysis of their host birds revealed significant genetic clustering along pathways of connectivity, namely for MAA. These findings are consistent with a contagious process occurring in some, but not all, case clusters."
https://openalex.org/W3171574300,"In September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall across the Caribbean region as a category 4 storm. In the aftermath, many residents of Puerto Rico were without power or clean running water for nearly a year. Using both English and Spanish tweets from September 16 to October 15 2017, we investigate discussion of Maria both on and off the island, constructing a proxy for the temporal network of communication between victims of the hurricane and others. We use information theoretic tools to compare the lexical divergence of different subgroups within the network. Lastly, we quantify temporal changes in user prominence throughout the event. We find at the global level that Spanish tweets more often contained messages of hope and a focus on those helping. At the local level, we find that information propagating among Puerto Ricans most often originated from sources local to the island, such as journalists and politicians. Critically, content from these accounts overshadows content from celebrities, global news networks, and the like for the large majority of the time period studied. Our findings reveal insight into ways social media campaigns could be deployed to disseminate relief information during similar events in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3166547051,"Cilia-associated respiratory bacillus (CARB; now known as Filobacterium rodentium gen. nov., sp. nov.) is a primary pathogen of rodents. A CARB-like organism was reported in post-mortem lung samples of cats using light and electron microscopy. Here we explore by molecular procedures if a Filobacterium sp. is a part of the normal feline lower respiratory microbiome and whether it could in some cats contribute to the development of chronic bronchial disease.A Filobacterium sp. was identified in three Czech cats clinically diagnosed as having chronic neutrophilic bronchitis. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens obtained from these cats were subjected to panbacterial 16S rDNA PCR followed by Sanger sequencing of the V5 to V8 region. After these cats were treated with specific antimicrobials, their clinical signs resolved promptly, without recurrence. Next, BALF specimens from 13 Australian and 11 Italian cats with lower respiratory disease and an additional 16 lung samples of Italian cats who died of various causes were examined using next generation sequencing (NGS). Subsequently, a Filobacterium-specific qPCR assay was developed and used to re-test BALF specimens from the 11 Italian cats and lung tissue homogenates from the additional 16 deceased cats.An amplicon of 548 bp with 91.24% sequence agreement with Filobacterium rodentium was obtained from all three patients, suggesting the novel Filobacterium sp. was the cause of their lower respiratory disease. The novel Filobacterium sp., which we propose to call F. felis, was detected in 3/3 Czech cats with chronic neutrophilic bronchitis, 13/13 Australian cats and 6/11 Italian cats with chronic lower respiratory disease, and 14/16 necropsy lung specimens from Italian cats. NGS and qPCR results all showed identical sequences. The Filobacterium sp. was sometimes the preponderant bacterial species in BALF specimens from cats with lower airway disease. There was an association between the presence of large numbers (greater than 105 organisms/mL) of Filobacterium and the presence of neutrophilic and/or histiocytic inflammation, although only a subset of inflammatory BALF specimens had F. felis as the preponderant organism.The novel Filobacterium sp. comprises a finite part of the normal feline lower respiratory microbiome. Under certain circumstances it can increase in absolute and relative abundance and give rise to neutrophilic and/or histiocytic bronchitis, bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia. These findings strongly suggest that F. felis could be an underdiagnosed cause of feline bronchial disease."
https://openalex.org/W3168452695,"The Noceto 'Vasca Votiva' (votive tank), discovered in excavations on a terrace at the southern edge of the Po Plain, northern Italy, is a unique well-preserved wooden (primarily oak) structure dated to the advanced through late Middle Bronze Age (~1600-1300 BCE). This complex monument, comprising two super-imposed tanks, is generally linked with an important but uncertain ritual role involving water. The context provides extraordinary preservation of both wooden, other organic, and cultural finds. The key question until now, hindering further interpretation of this remarkable structure, has been the precise date of the tanks. Initial work pointed to use of the two tanks over about a century. Using dendrochronology and radiocarbon 'wiggle-matching' we report near-absolute construction dates for both of the tanks. The lower (older) tank is dated ~1444±4 BCE and the upper (more recent) tank is dated 12 years later at ~1432±4 BCE. This dating of the construction of the Noceto tanks in the 3rd quarter of the 15th century BCE further enables us to reassess the overall period of activity of this wooden complex and its association with a major period of societal change in the Bronze Age of northern Italy starting in the later 15th century BCE."

https://openalex.org/W3166037945,"Estimation of disease prevalence at sub-city neighborhood scale allows early and targeted interventions that can help save lives and reduce public health burdens. However, the cost-prohibitive nature of highly localized data collection and sparsity of representative signals, has made it challenging to identify neighborhood scale prevalence of disease. To overcome this challenge, we utilize alternative data sources, which are both less sparse and representative of localized disease prevalence: using query data from a large commercial search engine, we identify the prevalence of respiratory illness in the United States, localized to census tract geographic granularity. Focusing on asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), we construct a set of features based on searches for symptoms, medications, and disease-related information, and use these to identify illness rates in more than 23 thousand tracts in 500 cities across the United States. Out of sample model estimates from search data alone correlate with ground truth illness rate estimates from the CDC at 0.69 to 0.76, with simple additions to these models raising those correlations to as high as 0.84. We then show that in practice search query data can be added to other relevant data such as census or land cover data to boost results, with models that incorporate all data sources correlating with ground truth data at 0.91 for asthma and 0.88 for COPD."
https://openalex.org/W3166607766,"In this paper we consider the effects of corporate hierarchies on innovation spread across multilayer networks, modeled by an elaborated SIR framework. We show that the addition of management layers can significantly improve spreading processes on both random geometric graphs and empirical corporate networks. Additionally, we show that utilizing a more centralized working relationship network rather than a strict administrative network further increases overall innovation reach. In fact, this more centralized structure in conjunction with management layers is essential to both reaching a plurality of nodes and creating a stable adopted community in the long time horizon. Further, we show that the selection of seed nodes affects the final stability of the adopted community, and while the most influential nodes often produce the highest peak adoption, this is not always the case. In some circumstances, seeding nodes near but not in the highest positions in the graph produces larger peak adoption and more stable long-time adoption."
