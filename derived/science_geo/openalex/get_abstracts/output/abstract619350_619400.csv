https://openalex.org/W2895554091,"It is very important to automatically detect violent behaviors in video surveillance scenarios, for instance, railway stations, gymnasiums and psychiatric centers. However, the previous detection methods usually extract descriptors around the spatiotemporal interesting points or extract statistic features in the motion regions, leading to limited abilities to effectively detect video-based violence activities. To address this issue, we propose a novel method to detect violence sequences. Firstly, the motion regions are segmented according to the distribution of optical flow fields. Secondly, in the motion regions, we propose to extract two kinds of low-level features to represent the appearance and dynamics for violent behaviors. The proposed low-level features are the Local Histogram of Oriented Gradient (LHOG) descriptor extracted from RGB images and the Local Histogram of Optical Flow (LHOF) descriptor extracted from optical flow images. Thirdly, the extracted features are coded using Bag of Words (BoW) model to eliminate redundant information and a specific-length vector is obtained for each video clip. At last, the video-level vectors are classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results on three challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed detection approach is superior to the previous methods."

This study provides novel evidence that TNFα leads to endothelial dysfunction associated with hypertension and vascular remodeling in preeclampsia through down-regulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) by NF-κB–dependent biogenesis of microRNA (miR)-31-5p, which targets eNOS mRNA. In this study, we found that miR-31-5p was up-regulated in sera from patients with preeclampsia and in human endothelial cells treated with TNFα. TNFα-mediated induction of miR-31-5p was blocked by an NF-κB inhibitor and NF-κB p65 knockdown but not by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, indicating that NF-κB is essential for biogenesis of miR-31-5p. The treatment of human endothelial cells with TNFα or miR-31-5p mimics decreased endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA stability without affecting eNOS promoter activity, resulting in inhibition of eNOS expression and NO/cGMP production through blocking of the functional activity of the eNOS mRNA 3′-UTR. Moreover, TNFα and miR-31-5p mimic evoked endothelial dysfunction associated with defects in angiogenesis, trophoblastic invasion, and vasorelaxation in an ex vivo cultured model of human placental arterial vessels, which are typical features of preeclampsia. These results suggest that NF-κB–responsive miR-31-5p elicits endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and vascular remodeling via post-transcriptional down-regulation of eNOS and is a molecular risk factor in the pathogenesis and development of preeclampsia.

https://openalex.org/W2895351440,"Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) is an indigenous legume crop, cultivated by subsistence farmers throughout sub-Saharan countries. Research findings indicate that the crop has great nutritional and agronomic potential, but it remains scientifically neglected. A baseline study was conducted in seven districts in semi-arid regions of rural Zimbabwe to gather knowledge on current production and utilization of bambara groundnut, assess its role in providing sustainable food and nutrition security for rural populations and determine priorities for follow-up research. Results revealed a variety of bambara groundnut processing techniques, which included boiling, soaking, roasting and milling across the surveyed districts. Reported constraints to processing and consumption included long cooking time, difficulties with milling and high firewood and water requirements. Fifty to eighty percent of respondents in all districts consumed bambara groundnut once or twice weekly from August to December. Preferred consumer attributes were taste, the satiating effect, nutritional benefits or a combination of these. Current, culturally acceptable processing techniques need improvement to support sustainable bambara groundnut processing while optimising nutrient bio-accessibility. Ultimately, community resilience to food and nutrition insecurity can be promoted by exchange of bambara groundnut processing knowledge amongst the production areas, involving the different stakeholders in the food supply chains."

Despite Ub E1’s fundamental importance to the cell and its attractiveness as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other diseases, its only available structural information is derived from yeast orthologs of human ubiquitin-like modifier–activating enzyme 1 (hUBA1). To illuminate structural differences between yeast and hUBA1 structures that might be exploited for the development of small-molecule therapeutics, we determined the first crystal structure of a hUBA1–Ub complex. Using structural analysis, molecular modeling, and biochemical analysis, we demonstrate that hUBA1 shares a conserved overall structure and mechanism with previously characterized yeast orthologs, but displays subtle structural differences, particularly within the active site. Computational analysis revealed four potential ligand-binding hot spots on the surface of hUBA1 that might serve as targets to inhibit hUBA1 at the level of Ub activation or E2 recruitment or that might potentially be used in approaches such as protein-targeting chimeric molecules. Taken together, our work enhances our understanding of the hUBA1 mechanism, provides an improved framework for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of UBA1, and serves as a stepping stone for structural studies that involve the enzymes of the human Ub system at the level of both E1 and E2.

https://openalex.org/W2894998213,"Neonicotinoids are a popular and widely-used class of insecticides whose heavy usage rates and purported negative impacts on bees and other beneficial insects has led to questions about their mobility and accumulation in the environment. Neonicotinoid compounds are currently registered for over 140 different crop uses in the United States, with commercial growers continuing to rely heavily on neonicotinoid insecticides for the control of key insect pests through a combination of in-ground and foliar applications. In 2008, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) began testing for neonicotinoids in groundwater test wells in the state, reporting detections of one or more neonicotinoids in dozens of shallow groundwater test wells. In 2011, similar detection levels were confirmed in several high-capacity overhead center-pivot irrigation systems in central Wisconsin. The current study was initiated to investigate the spatial extent and magnitude of neonicotinoid contamination in groundwater in and around areas of irrigated commercial agriculture in central Wisconsin. From 2013–2015 a total of 317 samples were collected from 91 unique high-capacity irrigation wells and tested for the presence of thiamethoxam (TMX), a neonicotinoid, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. 67% of all samples were positive for TMX at a concentration above the analytical limit of quantification (0.05 μg/L) and 78% of all wells tested positive at least once. Mean detection was 0.28 μg/L, with a maximum detection of 1.67 μg/L. Five wells had at least one detection exceeding 1.00 μg/L. Furthermore, an analysis of the spatial structure of these well detects suggests that contamination profiles vary across the landscape, with differences in mean detection levels observed from landscape (25 km), to farm (5 km), to individual well (500 m) scales. We also provide an update of DATCP’s neonicotinoid monitoring in Wisconsin’s shallow groundwater test wells and private potable wells for the years 2011–2017."
https://openalex.org/W2894900942,"Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between nutritional status and Parkinson's Disease (PD) features in association with depression, anxiety and quality of life in people with PD. Materials and methods This study was conducted on 96 patients with idiopathic PD to whom the following scales were applied: Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), 39-item PD questionnaire (PDQ-39), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). The scales and measurements were applied to patients at their first assessment. Patients with malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition were assessed by the dietitian and nutrition nurse. These patients received nutritional support through personalized diet recommendations and appropriate enteral nutritional products, considering factors such as age, comorbidity, socioeconomic and cultural conditions. At the end of 6 weeks, the scales and measurements applied during the first visit were again applied to the patients. Results A significant and inverse correlation was determined between mental (Spearman r:-0.510, p<0.001), activities of daily living (Spearman r:-0.520, p<0.001), motor (Spearman r:-0.480, p<0.001), complications (Spearman r:-0.346, p<0.001) UPDRS subdivisions and total scores (Spearman r:-0.644, p<0.001) and total MNA score. A significant and inverse correlation was found between all PDQ-39 subdomains and total MNA score (p<0.05). The highest inverse correlations were found in mobility (Spearman r:-0.690, p<0.001) and stigma (Spearman r:-0.570, p<0.001). Both depression (Spearman r:-0.631, p<0.001) and anxiety (Spearman r:-0.333, p<0.001) scores were determined to be inversely correlated with total MNA score. At the 6-week control visit, significantly lower scores were found in all subdivisions and in the total UPDRS score, PDQ-39 score and in the patients' anxiety and depression scores (p<0.05). MNA scores were found to be significantly higher in the assessment performed after 6 weeks of support for patients who had abnormal nutritional status at inception (p<0.001). Conclusion PD motor and nonmotor functions, disease duration and severity are related to nutritional status. Quality of life was also shown to be affected by changes in the nutritional status. These results show that nutritional status assessment should be a standard approach in the PD treatment and follow-up processes."
https://openalex.org/W2894912337,"Studies in western zoo elephants have found relationships between body condition and physiological function, and identified mitigating management strategies to optimize health and welfare. A similar methodological approach was used in this study, which evaluated a body condition score (BCS; 1 = thinnest, 5 = fattest) every other month and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations twice monthly in 33 tourist camp elephants in Thailand for a 1-year period to assess seasonal variations, and determine how lipid profiles [total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), triglycerides (TG)] and metabolic parameters [insulin, glucose, fructosamine, glucose to insulin ratio (G:I)] related to measures of body condition and adrenal function. The most prevalent BCS was 3-3.5 (60.6%), with 27.3% at BCS = 4 (overweight) and 12.1% at BCS = 4.5-5 (very overweight); no elephants had a BCS <2. BCSs were higher in rainy and winter seasons compared to summer, with FGM, TG, HDL, LDL, and insulin also higher in the rainy and/or winter seasons (p<0.05). By contrast, TC and glucose were lowest in the rainy season. FGM measures were negatively associated with two environmental factors: temperature and rainfall, but not humidity. Positive correlations were found between BCS and TC, LDL, and HDL, and between FGM and TC, HDL, glucose, and insulin (p<0.05), whereas BCS and FGM were both negatively associated with the G:I (p<0.05). However, there was no relationship between BCS and FGM among the camp elephants. Using BCS and FGM measures as outcome variables in separate regression models, this study found high BCS and elevated FGM concentrations were associated with altered lipid profiles and metabolic status in elephants. Furthermore, more work hours/day was associated with better body condition and health measures. Thus, being overweight and exposed to factors that increase adrenal activity could adversely affect health status, requiring alterations in management for some individuals, whereas exercise appears to have a protective effect."
https://openalex.org/W2894577746,"We have observed that marine macroalgae produce sound during photosynthesis. The resultant soundscapes correlate with benthic macroalgal cover across shallow Hawaiian coral reefs during the day, despite the presence of other biological noise. Likely ubiquitous but previously overlooked, this source of ambient biological noise in the coastal ocean is driven by local supersaturation of oxygen near the surface of macroalgal filaments, and the resultant formation and release of oxygen-containing bubbles into the water column. During release, relaxation of the bubble to a spherical shape creates a monopole sound source that ‘rings’ at the Minnaert frequency. Many such bubbles create a large, distributed sound source over the sea floor. Reef soundscapes contain vast quantities of biological information, making passive acoustic ecosystem evaluation a tantalizing prospect if the sources are known. Our observations introduce the possibility of a general, volumetrically integrative, noninvasive, rapid and remote technique for evaluating algal abundance and rates of primary productivity in littoral aquatic communities. Increased algal cover is one of the strongest indicators for coral reef ecosystem stress. Visually determining variations in algal abundance is a time-consuming and expensive process. This technique could therefore provide a valuable tool for ecosystem management but also for industrial monitoring of primary production, such as in algae-based biofuel synthesis."

Much of the available literature suffers from methodological biases that compromise the validity of clinical recommendations. We conducted a matched cohort study during an epidemic in French Guiana to compare events and pregnancy outcomes between two paired groups of pregnant women: women having presented with symptomatic dengue during pregnancy (n = 73) and women having had neither fever nor dengue during pregnancy (n = 219). Women in each arm were matched by place of follow up, gestation weeks at inclusion, and place of residence. Dengue infection was considered to be confirmed if viral RNA, N S1 antigen, the seroconversion of IgM antibodies or the presence of IgM was detected in collected samples. According to the 2009 WHO classification, 27% of the women with symptomatic dengue had at least one clinical or biological warning sign. These complications occurred after the 28th week of gestation in 55% of cases. The medical history, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics were included in multivariate analysis. Exposure to dengue during pregnancy was not significantly associated with prematurity, small for gestational age infants, hypertension or emergency caesarian section. Maternal dengue with warning signs was a risk factor for peripartum hemorrhage with adjusted relative risk = 8.6(95% CI = 1.2–62). There was a near significant association between dengue and in utero death (p = 0.09). This prospective comparative study underlined the importance of taking into account potential confounders between exposure to dengue and the occurrence of obstetrical events. It also confirms the need for increased vigilance for pregnant women with dengue, particularly for women who present with severe dengue."
https://openalex.org/W2895153968,"The question of cognitive complexity in early Homo sapiens in North Africa is intimately tied to the emergence of the Aterian culture (~145 ka). One of the diagnostic indicators of cognitive complexity is the presence of specialised bone tools, however significant uncertainty remains over the manufacture and use of these artefacts within the Aterian techno-complex. In this paper we report on a bone artefact from Aterian Middle Stone Age (MSA) deposits in Dar es-Soltan 1 cave on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. It comes from a layer that can be securely dated to ~90 ka. The typological characteristics of this tool, which suggest its manufacture and use as a bone knife, are comparatively similar to other bone artefacts from dated Aterian levels at the nearby site of El Mnasra and significantly different from any other African MSA bone technology. The new find from Dar es-Soltan 1 cave combined with those from El Mnasra suggest the development of a bone technology unique to the Aterian."
https://openalex.org/W2895440957,"Neutrophil recruitment and plasma exudation are key elements in the immune response to injury or infection. Activated neutrophils stimulate opening of the endothelial barrier; however, the underlying mechanisms have remained largely unknown. In this study, we identified a pivotal role of the proinflammatory kallikrein-kinin system and consequent formation of bradykinin in neutrophil-evoked vascular leak. In mouse and hamster models of acute inflammation, inhibitors of bradykinin generation, and signaling markedly reduced plasma exudation in response to chemoattractant activation of neutrophils. The neutrophil-driven leak was likewise suppressed in mice deficient in either the bradykinin B2 receptor or factor XII (initiator of the kallikrein-kinin system). In human endothelial cell monolayers, material secreted from activated neutrophils induced cytoskeletal rearrangement, leading to paracellular gap formation in a bradykinin-dependent manner. As a mechanistic basis, we found that a neutrophil-derived heparin-binding protein (HBP/azurocidin) displaced the bradykinin precursor high-molecular-weight kininogen from endothelial cells, thereby enabling proteolytic processing of kininogen into bradykinin by neutrophil and plasma proteases. These data provide novel insight into the signaling pathway by which neutrophils open up the endothelial barrier and identify the kallikrein-kinin system as a target for therapeutic interventions in acute inflammatory reactions.—Kenne, E., Rasmuson, J., Renné, T., Vieira, M.

https://openalex.org/W2895597430,"Background There is a need for theory informed interventions to optimise medication reporting. This study aimed to quantify and explain behavioural determinants relating to error reporting of healthcare professionals in Qatar as a basis of developing interventions to optimise the effectiveness and efficiency of error reporting. Methods A sequential explanatory mixed methods design comprising a cross-sectional survey followed by focus groups in Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar. All doctors, nurses and pharmacists were invited to complete a questionnaire that included items of behavioural determinants derived from the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), an integrative framework of 33 theories of behaviour change. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify components, with total component scores computed. Differences in total scores among demographic groupings were tested using Mann-Whitney U test (2 groups) or Kruskal-Wallis (>2 groups). Respondents expressing interest in focus group participation were sampled purposively, and discussions based on survey findings using the TDF to provide further insight to survey findings. Ethical approval was received from Hamad Medical Corporation, Robert Gordon University, and Qatar University. Results One thousand, six hundred and four questionnaires were received (67.9% nurses, 13.3% doctors, 12.9% pharmacists). Questionnaire items clustered into six components of: knowledge and skills related to error reporting; feedback and support; action and impact; motivation; effort; and emotions. There were statistically significant higher scores in relation to age (older more positive, p<0.001), experience as a healthcare professional (more experienced most positive apart from those with the highest level of experience, p<0.001), and profession (pharmacists most positive, p<0.05). Fifty-four healthcare professionals from different disciplines participated in the focus groups. Themes mapped to nine of fourteen TDF domains. In terms of emotions, the themes that emerged as barriers to error reporting were: fear and worry on submitting a report; that submitting was likely to lead to further investigation that could impact performance evaluation and career progression; concerns over the impact on working relationships; and the potential lack of confidentiality. Conclusions This study has quantified and explained key facilitators and barriers of medication error reporting. Barriers appeared to be largely centred on issues relating to emotions and related beliefs of consequences. Quantitative results demonstrated that while these were issues for all healthcare professionals, those younger and less experienced were most concerned. Qualitative findings highlighted particular concerns relating to these emotional aspects. These results can be used to develop theoretically informed interventions with the aims of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the medication reporting systems impacting patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W2894883144,"Interpersonal touch is emerging as an important topic in the study of adult relationships, with recent research showing that such behaviors can promote better relationship functioning and individual well-being. This investigation considers whether being hugged is associated with reduced conflict-related decreases in positive affect and increases in negative affect as well as whether these associations differ between women and men. A sample of 404 adults were interviewed every night for 14 consecutive days about their conflicts, hug receipt, and positive and negative affect. Results indicated that there was an interaction between hug receipt and conflict exposure such that receiving a hug was associated with a smaller conflict-related decrease in positive affect and a smaller conflict-related increase in negative affect when assessed concurrently. Hug receipt was also prospectively associated with a smaller conflict-related increase in next day negative affect but was not associated with next day positive affect. Associations between hug receipt and conflict-related changes in affect did not differ between women and men, between individuals who were married or in a marital-like relationship and those who were not, or as a function of individual differences in baseline perceived social support. While correlational, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that hugs buffer against deleterious changes in affect associated with experiencing interpersonal conflict. Possible mechanisms through which hugs facilitate positive adaptation to conflict are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2895019783,"Tooth crown tissue proportions and enamel thickness distribution are considered reliable characters for inferring taxonomic identity, phylogenetic relationships, dietary and behavioural adaptations in fossil and extant hominids. While most Pleistocene hominins display variations from thick to hyper-thick enamel, Neanderthals exhibit relatively thinner. However, the chronological and geographical origin for the appearance of this typical Neanderthal condition is still unknown. The European late Early Pleistocene species Homo antecessor (Gran Dolina-TD6 site, Sierra de Atapuerca) represents an opportunity to investigate the appearance of the thin condition in the fossil record. In this study, we aim to test the hypothesis if H. antecessor molars approximates the Neanderthal condition for tissue proportions and enamel thickness. To do so, for the first time we characterised the molar inner structural organization in this Early Pleistocene hominin taxon (n = 17) and compared it to extinct and extant populations of the genus Homo from African, Asian and European origin (n = 355). The comparative sample includes maxillary and mandibular molars belonging to H. erectus, East and North African Homo, European Middle Pleistocene Homo, Neanderthals, and fossil and extant H. sapiens. We used high-resolution images to investigate the endostructural configuration of TD6 molars (tissue proportions, enamel thickness and distribution). TD6 permanent molars tend to exhibit on average thick absolute and relative enamel in 2D and 3D estimates, both in the complete crown and the lateral enamel. This condition is shared with the majority of extinct and extant hominin sample, except for Neanderthals and some isolated specimens. However, while the total crown percentage of dentine in TD6 globally resembles the low modern values, the lateral crown percentage of dentine tends to be much higher, closer to the Neanderthal signal. Similarly, the H. antecessor molar enamel distribution maps reveal a relative distribution pattern that is more similar to the Neanderthal condition (with the thickest enamel more spread at the periphery of the occlusal basin) rather than that of other fossil specimens and modern humans (with thicker cuspal enamel). Future studies on European Middle Pleistocene populations will provide more insights into the evolutionary trajectory of the typical Neanderthal dental structural organization."
https://openalex.org/W2894766391,"Produced by levansucrase, levan and levan oligosaccharides (GFn) have potential applications in food and pharmaceutical industries such as prebiotics, anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory agents. Previous study reported that Bacillus licheniformis RN-01 levansucrase could produce levan oligosaccharides and long-chain levan. However, its N251A and N251Y mutants could effectively produce short-chain oligosaccharides upto GF3, but they could not produce long-chain levan. We hypothesized that these mutations probably reduced GF3 binding affinity in levansucrase active site that contains fructosyl-Asp93 intermediate and caused GF3 to be in an unfavorable orientation for transfructosylation; therefore, levansucrase could not effectively extend GF3 by one fructosyl residue to produce GF4 and subsequently long-chain levan. However, these mutations probably did not significantly reduce binding affinity or drastically change orientation of GF2; therefore, levansucrase could still extend GF2 to produce GF3. Using this hypothesis, we employed molecular dynamics to investigate effects of these mutations on GF2/GF3 binding in levansucrase active site. Our results reasonably support this hypothesis as N251A and N251Y mutations did not significantly reduce GF2 binding affinity, as calculated by MM-GBSA technique and hydrogen bond occupations, or drastically change orientation of GF2 in levansucrase active site, as measured by distance between atoms necessary for transfructosylation. However, these mutations drastically decreased GF3 binding affinity and caused GF3 to be in an unfavorable orientation for transfructosylation. Furthermore, the free energy decomposition and hydrogen bond occupation results suggest the importance of Arg255 in GF2/GF3 binding in levansucrase active site. This study provides important and novel insight into the effects of N251A and N251Y mutations on GF2/GF3 binding in levansucrase active site and how they may disrupt production of long-chain levan. This knowledge could be beneficial in designing levansucrase to efficiently produce levan oligosaccharides with desired length."
https://openalex.org/W2894983953,"Far space and near space refer to different spatial features in which we unfold our behaviour. On the one hand, classical visuospatial neuropsychological tests assess spatial abilities in the near space; on the other, far space typically involves new spatial memory tasks in which participants display their behaviour in an environment, either interacting with objects or searching for targets. The Boxes Room Task is a virtual test that assesses spatial memory in the far space. Based upon this task, a new test was developed in which participants could not move about within the context, but they could actually perceive it from a specific viewpoint. In this work, both versions of the task were compared with one another. Furthermore, they were also compared with the results of 10/36 spatial recall test, a task assessing spatial memory in the near space. Two conditions were applied in all tasks, both in stable and rotated contexts. Our study included one hundred and twenty healthy young participants who were divided into two groups. The first group performed the Walking Space Boxes Room Task. A second group performed the Non-Walking Space Boxes Room Task as well as another traditional neuropsychological test for near space assessment, the 10/36 spatial recall test. Results proved that orientation in the non-walking space was more difficult than in the walking space. Additionally, our test also showed that men outperformed women in both virtual reality-based tasks, although they did not do it in the traditional 10/36 spatial recall test. In short, this work exposes that virtual-reality technologies provide tools to assess spatial memory, being more sensitive than traditional tests in the detection of small performance changes."
https://openalex.org/W2895538038,"This study aimed at investigating the antimicrobial activity of different solvent extracts of Chinese cabbage Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis (BRARP) and their antioxidant and cytotoxicity properties. Of the different solvents extracts, the chloroform extracts (CE) were significantly inhibited the bacterial pathogens at minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 16.5 mg.mL-1. Biochemical analysis revealed that total phenol (62.6 ± 0.05 mg GAE.g-1) and flavonoids (27.6 ± 0.04 mg QE.g-1) were higher in the extracts of BRARP, which resulted in enhanced antioxidant activity in CE. A total of eight dominant compounds were detected in the potent antimicrobial extract from BRARP based on GC-MS analysis. The molecular interactions study revealed that, among the screened compounds the 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid and 2,3-dicyanopropionamide interacted with the active site of pathogenicity and survival related protein with lipopolysaccharide (LpxC) with higer binding energy. This work concluded that the 1, 2-Benzenedicarboxylic acid and 2, 3-Dicyanopropionamide from BRARP was reported to be good non-cytotoxic and antioxidant antimicrobials against bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2895659424,"Introduction Vancomycin associated acute kidney injury (vAKI) is a well known complication in pediatric patients. Identification and characterization of the incidence and risk factors for vAKI in the pediatric population would assist clinicians in potentially preventing or mitigating vAKI. Methods and materials A 6 year retrospective cohort study was designed. Patients were included if they were < 19 years of age, received vancomycin as inpatients, and had a baseline SCr and one other SCr drawn during and up to 72 hours after the discontinuation of vancomycin. Data collection included patient demographics, vancomycin doses and length of therapy, vancomycin serum concentrations, and concomitant medications. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria were used to characterize acute kidney injury. Descriptive statistical methods were used and ordinal logistic regression was employed to determine variables significantly associated with vAKI. Results A total of 7,095 patients met study criteria (55.4% male, median age 4.1 years (IQR 0.67–11.2 years)). Mechanical ventilation was used in 7.9% (n = 563) and mortality was 4.9% (n = 344). A total of 153 concomitant medications were identified. A median of 5 (IQR 3–7) SCr values were obtained and median SCr prior to vancomycin was 0.39 (IQR 0.28–0.57) mg/dL (CrCl 134±58 mL/min/1.73m2). Vancomycin was administered for a median of 2 (IQR 1–3) days (14.9±1.6 mg/kg/dose). vAKI was present in 12.2% (n = 862: KDIGO stage 1 (8.30%, n = 589), KDIGO stage 2 (1.94%, n = 138) KDIGO stage 3 (1.89%, n = 134)). Mean vancomycin serum concentration at 6–8 hours after a dose for patients with vAKI (10.7±8.9 mg/L) was significantly, but not clinically different for patients with no vAKI (7.5±6.3 mg/L). (p<0.05) Ordinal logistic regression identified total dose of vancomycin, vancomycin administration in the intensive care unit, and concomitant medication administration as significant for vAKI. In particular, concomitant administration of several different medications, including nafcillin, clindamycin, and acetazolamide, were noted for strong associations with vAKI. (p<0.05) Conclusions Moderate to severe acute kidney injury due to vancomycin is infrequent in children and associated with concomitant medication use and total dose of vancomycin. Serum vancomycin concentrations are not useful predictors of vAKI in the pediatric population."
https://openalex.org/W2894691536,"Background In addition to improving water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) measures and optimal case management, the introduction of Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is a complementary strategy for cholera prevention and control for vulnerable population groups. In October 2016, the Mozambique Ministry of Health implemented a mass vaccination campaign using a two-dose regimen of the Shanchol™ OCV in six high-risk neighborhoods of Nampula city, in Northern Mozambique. Overall 193,403 people were targeted by the campaign, which used a door-to-door strategy. During campaign follow-up, a population survey was conducted to assess: (1) OCV coverage; (2) frequency of adverse events following immunization; (3) vaccine acceptability and (4) reasons for non-vaccination. Methodology/Principal findings In the absence of a household listing and clear administrative neighborhood delimitations, we used geospatial technology to select households from satellite images and used the support of community leaders. One person per household was randomly selected for interview. In total, 636 individuals were enrolled in the survey. The overall vaccination coverage with at least one dose (including card and oral reporting) was 69.5% (95%CI: 51.2–88.2) and the two-dose coverage was 51.2% (95%CI: 37.9–64.3). The campaign was well accepted. Among the 185 non-vaccinated individuals, 83 (44.6%) did not take the vaccine because they were absent when the vaccination team visited their houses. Among the 451 vaccinated individuals, 47 (10%) reported minor and non-specific complaints, and 78 (17.3%) mentioned they did not receive any information before the campaign. Conclusions/Significance In spite of overall coverage being slightly lower than expected, the use of a mobile door-to-door strategy remains a viable option even in densely-populated urban settings. Our results suggest that campaigns can be successfully implemented and well accepted in Mozambique in non-emergency contexts in order to prevent cholera outbreaks. These findings are encouraging and complement the previous Mozambican experience related to OCV."
https://openalex.org/W2894958833,"The transition from short-term to long-term forms of synaptic plasticity requires protein synthesis and new gene expression. Most efforts to understand experience-induced changes in neuronal gene expression have focused on the transcription products of RNA polymerase II-primarily mRNAs and the proteins they encode. We recently showed that nucleolar integrity and activity-dependent ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis are essential for the maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Consequently, the synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis predicts that nucleolar integrity and activity dependent rRNA synthesis would be required for Long-term memory (LTM). We tested this prediction using the hippocampus-dependent, Active Place Avoidance (APA) spatial memory task and found that training induces de novo rRNA synthesis in mouse dorsal hippocampus. This learning-induced increase in nucleolar activity and rRNA synthesis persists at least 24 h after training. In addition, intra-hippocampal injection of the Pol I specific inhibitor, CX-5461 prior to training, revealed that de novo rRNA synthesis is required for 24 h memory, but not for learning. Using qPCR to assess activity-dependent changes in gene expression, we found that of seven known rRNA expression variants (v-rRNAs), only one, v-rRNA IV, is significantly upregulated right after training. These data indicate that learning induced v-rRNAs are crucial for LTM, and constitute the first evidence that differential rRNA gene expression plays a role in memory."
https://openalex.org/W2895282953,"Dendritic spine morphology and dendritic arborization are key determinants of neuronal connectivity and play critical roles in learning, memory and behavior function. Recently, defects of ZBTB20, a BTB and zinc finger domain containing transcriptional repressor, have been implicated in a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and autism. Here we show distinct effects of expression of two major isoforms, long and short, of ZBTB20, and its neurodevelopmental disorder-linked variants, on dendritic architecture of cultured rat cortical pyramidal neurons. The N-terminal of ZBTB20 showed a role in regulating dendritic spine morphology. Two ZBTB20 single nucleotide variants, located at the N-terminal and central regions of the protein and potentially conferring autism risk, altered dendritic spine morphology. In contrast, a single nucleotide variant identified in patients with intellectual disability and located at the C-terminus of ZBTB20 affected dendritic arborization and dendritic length but had no effect on dendritic spine morphology. Furthermore, truncation of the extreme C-terminus of ZBTB20 caused spine and dendritic morphological changes that were similar but distinct from those caused by the C-terminal variant. Taken together, our study suggests ZBTB20’s role in dendritic and synaptic structure and provide possible mechanisms of its effect in neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2950361028,"Background Recent studies report that surfaces displaying micrometer- or nanometer-sized undulating structures exhibit antibacterial effects. In previous work, we described the use of an advanced nanofabrication technique to generate an artificial biomimetic Moth-eye film by coating a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film with nanoscale moth-eye protrusions made from a hydrophilic resin. This moth-eye film exhibited enhanced antibacterial effects in in vitro experiments. The aim of the present study was to verify the antibacterial efficacy of the Moth-eye film in practical environments. Materials and methods The antibacterial effects of three types of film (Moth-eye film, Flat film, and PET film) were compared. Sample films were pasted onto hand washing basins at the testing locations. After several hours, bacteria were collected from the surface of the sample films with one of three kinds of culture media stamper (to permit identification of bacterial species). The stampers were incubated for 48 hours at 35°C, and the numbers of colonies were counted. Results and discussion The number of common bacteria including E. coli and S. aureus obtained from the Moth-eye film was significantly lower than those from the PET film (p<0.05) and Flat film at 1 hour (p<0.05). This study found that the Moth-eye film showed a long-term (6h) antibacterial effect and the Moth-eye structure (PET coated with nanoscale cone-shaped pillars) demonstrated a physical antibacterial effect from earlier time points. Therefore, the Moth-eye film appears to have potential general-purpose applications in practical environments."

This study aimed to identify lifestyle risk factors for OAG in a Japanese population.This population-based, cross-sectional study recruited Japanese participants aged 40 years or older from January 2013 to March 2015. We took fundus photographs for OAG screening, determined lifestyle and health characteristics through a questionnaire and performed physical examinations. The participants who had suspect findings in the fundus photographs were sent for a detailed ophthalmic examination to diagnose OAG. Lifestyle and heath characteristics were statistically compared between the OAG and non-OAG participants. A total of 1583 participants were included in the study, of which 42 had OAG and 1541 did not have OAG. The number of days per week that the female participants consumed meat (mean±SD; OAG: 1.7±1.2 days, non-OAG: 2.7±1.5 days) was negatively associated with OAG (OR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.43-0.88; p = 0.007). Higher intraocular pressure was positively associated with OAG in men (OR = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05-1.38, p = 0.009). No significant difference between participants with and without OAG was observed for a range of other lifestyle factors and health criteria including self-report of diabetes, number of family living together, body mass index, blood pressure, pulse rate, coffee drinking, tea drinking, alcohol drinking, number of fruits consumed per day and days of fish consumption per week.A higher weekly consumption of meat appears to be negatively associated with OAG in Japanese women. Increasing the dietary intake of meat can contribute to reducing the risk of developing OAG."
https://openalex.org/W2895572841,"Background and objective The mechanism of dyspnoea associated with pleural effusion is uncertain. A cohort of patients requiring thoracoscopy for unilateral exudative effusion were investigated for associations between dyspnoea and suggested predictors: impaired ipsilateral diaphragm movement, effusion volume and restricted lung inflation. Methods Baseline Dyspnoea Index, respiratory function, and ultrasound assessment of ipsilateral diaphragm movement were assessed prior to thoracoscopy, when effusion volume was measured. Transitional Dyspnoea Index (change from baseline) was assessed 4 and 8 weeks after thoracoscopy. Pearson product moment assessed bivariate correlations and a general linear model examined how well total lung capacity (measuring restricted lung inflation), effusion volume and impaired diaphragm movement predicted Baseline Dyspnoea Index. Un-paired t tests compared the groups with normal and impaired diaphragm movement. Results 19 patients were studied (14 malignant etiology). Total lung capacity was associated with Baseline Dyspnoea Index (r = 0.68, P = 0.003). Effusion volume (r = -0.138, P = 0.60) and diaphragm movement (P = 0.09) were not associated with Baseline Dyspnoea Index. Effusion volume was larger with impaired diaphragm movement compared to normal diaphragm movement (2.16 ±SD 0.95 vs.1.16 ±0.92 L, P = 0.009). Total lung capacity was lower with impaired diaphragm movement compared to normal diaphragm movement (65.4 ±10.3 vs 78.2 ±8.6% predicted, P = 0.011). The optimal general linear model to predict Baseline Dyspnoea Index used total lung capacity alone (adjusted R2 = 0.42, P = 0.003). In nine participants with controlled effusion, baseline effusion volume (r = 0.775, P = 0.014) and total lung capacity (r = -0.690, P = 0.040) were associated with Transitional Dyspnoea Index. Conclusions Restricted lung inflation was the principal predictor of increased dyspnoea prior to thoracoscopic drainage of effusion, with no independent additional association with either effusion volume or impaired ipsilateral diaphragm movement. Restricted lung inflation may be an important determinant of the dyspnoea associated with pleural effusion."
https://openalex.org/W2895299264,"Mitogens are diverse compounds of plant and microbial origin, widely employed to test immunocompetence in animals. The blastogenic response of bovine Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) to lypopolysaccharides (LPS) has been investigated in our laboratories for a long time. In particular, a possible correlation between blastogenic response to LPS and disease resistance of periparturient dairy cows had been observed in previous studies. Most important, low responder cows presented a higher frequency of disease cases after calving, compared with high responder animals. Owing to the above, different aspects of the blastogenic response to LPS were investigated on PBMC of healthy Friesian cows, using a 72-hour Bromodeoxyuridin (BrDU) cell proliferation assay. Stimulation with LPS induced little if any replication of bovine PBMC over 72 hours despite consistent BrDU detection in all the PBMC samples under study. Poor replication of LPS-stimulated PBMC was confirmed by cell cycle and cell growth flow cytometry analyses. In particular, LPS stimulation gave rise to very low percentages of S phase cells, sometimes lower than in control, unstimulated cells, as opposed to Concanavalin A-stimulated PBMC. Magnetic separation and analysis of BrDU-treated bovine PBMC after exposure to LPS showed that both B and CD4 T cells are involved in the blastogenic response to LPS, in contrast with current data based on human and murine models. Finally, LPS caused an early, specific up-regulation of TNF-α and TLR4 genes in bovine PBMC, and significant correlations were shown between the expression of inflammatory cytokine and Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) genes. On the whole, our data indicate that differences in the blastogenic response to LPS could be partly accounted for by heterogenicity of responding cells (B and T lymphocytes), which might also have an impact on induction and regulation of inflammatory responses and endotoxin tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2895479215,"Deleted in Liver Cancer-1 (DLC1), a member of the RhoGAP family of proteins, functions as a tumor suppressor in several cancers including breast cancer. However, its clinical relevance is unclear in breast cancer. In this study, expression of DLC1 was correlated with prognosis using publicly available breast cancer gene expression datasets and quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR in cohorts of Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Low expression of DLC1 correlates with poor prognosis in patients with ER+ breast cancer with further decrease in metastatic lesions. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data showed that down regulation of DLC1 is not due to methylation or mutations. To seek further insights in understanding the role of DLC1 in ER+ breast cancer, we stably overexpressed DLC1-full-length (DLC1-FL) in T-47D breast cancer cells; this inhibited cell colony formation significantly in vitro compared to its control counterpart. Label-free global proteomic and TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment assays (ProteomeXchange identifier PXD008220) showed that 205 and 122 phosphopeptides were unique to DLC1-FL cells and T-47D-control cells, respectively, whereas 6,726 were quantified by phosphoproteomics analysis in both conditions. The top three significant clusters of differentially phosphopeptides identified by DAVID pathway analysis represent cell-cell adhesion, mRNA processing and splicing, and transcription regulation. Phosphoproteomics analysis documented an inverse relation between DLC1 expression and several phosphopeptides including epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 (ECT2). Decreased phosphorylation of ECT2 at the residue T359, critical for its active conformational change, was validated by western blot. In addition, the ECT2 T359-containing phosphopeptide was detected in both basal and luminal patient-derived breast cancers breast cancer phosphoproteomics data on the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) Assay portal. Together, for the first time, this implicates ECT2 phosphorylation in breast cancer, which has been proposed as a therapeutic target in lung cancer. In conclusion, this data suggests that low expression of DLC1 is associated with poor prognosis. Targeting ECT2 phosphopeptides could provide a promising mechanism for controlling poor prognosis seen in DLC1low ER+ breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2894740407,"The present study aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of topical and intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) compared with that of topical placebo and to assess the noninferiority between the two application methods of TXA in patients undergoing unilateral primary total hip arthroplasty.Our randomized controlled trial investigated 170 patients with 1:1:1 allocation to two doses of 10-mg/kg intravenous TXA, 3-g topical TXA, and topical placebo of 60-ml physiological saline groups. The primary outcome, total blood loss, was calculated with Nadler and Gross formula. The secondary outcomes included allogeneic blood transfusion requirement, drain blood loss, decreased hemoglobin level. Noninferiority would be established when the upper limit 95% CI is lower than 250 ml of the noninferiority margin for the mean difference of total blood loss between topical and intravenous TXA. Thromboembolic complication incidence was considered as a safety outcome.The total blood loss of patients administered intravenous (mean±standard deviation, 1125±514 ml) and topical TXA (1211±425 ml) was significantly reduced compared with that of those administered topical placebo (1464±556 ml) (p = 0.0012). Drain blood loss and hemoglobin level reduction in patients administered with TXA were also significantly lower than those in patients administered topical placebo. The mean difference of total blood loss between topical and intravenous TXA is 86 ml (95% CI, -88 to 260 ml). The complications were comparable between patients managed with TXA and patients with topical placebo.The noninferiority of topical TXA to intravenous TXA can not be concluded. Considering no significant difference was found in all efficacy outcomes between the two administration methods. Any of the two TXA administration methods can be adopted for blood loss prevention in total hip arthroplasty."
https://openalex.org/W2894756602,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) transmission through infected blood and blood products has already been described. However, little is known about the bone marrow (BM) as source of HEV infection. Our study aimed to investigate the presence of HEV antigen (Ag) and histological changes in BM of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) experimentally and naturally infected with HEV. Four cynomolgus monkeys with acute, and two with chronic hepatitis E ─ after immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus ─ were compared with one colony-bred animal naturally infected. Both, natural and experimental infections were characterized by anti-HEV IgG seroconversion detected by ELISA, and viral RNA isolation confirmed by RT-qPCR and qualitative nested RT-PCR. BM biopsies were collected from all animals, submitted to histology and indirect immunofluorescence techniques and observed, respectively, by light and confocal microscopy. The HEV Ag-fluorescent-labeled cells were detected from BM biopsies obtained from three monkeys with acute and one with chronic hepatitis E, and also from the naturally infected monkey. In the experimentally infected animals with acute hepatitis, HEV Ag detection occurred at 160 days post-infection, even after viral clearance in serum, feces, and liver. Double-stranded RNA, a replicative marker, was detected in BM cells from both acute and chronically infected animals. Major histological findings included vacuolization in mononuclear and endosteal cells, an absence of organized inflammatory infiltrates, and also some fields suggesting displasic focal BM disease. These findings support the hypothesis of BM cells as secondary target sites of HEV persistence. Further experimental studies should be carried out to confirm the assumption of HEV transmission through BM transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2895397659,"Clostridium difficile infection is a public health concern. C. difficile was found in healthy human intestine as a member of Clostridium XI. Because soluble fermentable fiber ingestion affects intestinal microbiota, we used fiber-containing diets to determine the intestinal microbial condition that could reduce the presence of Clostridium XI.Newly weaned male mice were assigned to three published diets: Control AIN-93G purified diet with only poorly fermented cellulose; Control plus 5% purified fermentable fiber inulin; Chow with wheat, soybean and corn that provide a mixture of unpurified dietary fibers. Methods were developed to quantify 24-hour fecal microbial load and microbial DNA density. The relative abundance of bacterial genera and the bacterial diversity were determined through 16S rRNA sequence-based fecal microbiota analysis.Mice adjusted food intake to maintain the same energy intake and body weight under these three moderate-fat (7% w:w) diets. Chow-feeding led to higher food intake but also higher 24-h fecal output. Chow-feeding and 1-8 wk ingestion of inulin-supplemented diet increased daily fecal microbial load and density along with lowering the prevalence of Clostridium XI to undetectable. Clostridium XI remained undetectable until 4 weeks after the termination of inulin-supplemented diet. Fermentable fiber intake did not consistently increase probiotic genera such as Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus. Chow feeding, but not inulin supplementation, increased the bacterial diversity.Increase fecal microbial load/density upon fermentable fiber ingestion is associated with a lower and eventually undetectable presence of Clostridium XI. Higher bacterial diversity or abundance of particular genera is not apparently essential. Future studies are needed to see whether this observation can be translated into the reduction of C. difficile at the species level in at-risk populations."
https://openalex.org/W2894620534,"Humans have a comparatively higher rate of more polymorphisms in regulatory regions of the primate CCR5 gene, an immune system gene with both general and specific functions. This has been interpreted as allowing flexibility and diversity of gene expression in response to varying disease loads. A broad expression repertoire is useful to humans—the only globally distributed primate—due to our unique adaptive pattern that increased pathogen exposure and disease loads (e.g., sedentism, subsistence practices). The main objective of the study was to determine if the previously observed human pattern of increased variation extended to other members of our genus, Homo. The data for this study are mined from the published genomes of extinct hominins (four Neandertals and two Denisovans), an ancient human (Ust’-Ishim), and modern humans (1000 Genomes). An average of 15 polymorphisms per individual were found in human populations (with a total of 262 polymorphisms). There were 94 polymorphisms identified across extinct Homo (an average of 13 per individual) with 41 previously observed in modern humans and 53 novel polymorphisms (32 in Denisova and 21 in Neandertal). Neither the frequency nor distribution of polymorphisms across gene regions exhibit significant differences within the genus Homo. Thus, humans are not unique with regards to the increased frequency of regulatory polymorphisms and the evolution of variation patterns across CCR5 gene appears to have originated within the genus. A broader evolutionary perspective on regulatory flexibility may be that it provided an advantage during the transition to confrontational foraging (and later hunting) that altered human-environment interaction as well as during migration to Eurasia and encounters with novel pathogens."

As such the authors aimed to explore medical students learning needs and preferences for informed consent and relevant ethical issues in the clerkship environments. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study using a self-administered, printed survey distributed to final year clinical clerks. Results 84% completed the survey. Students indicated the need for more attention to all topics related to informed consent (mean = 7.1 on a scale of 0 to 9; ±1.2). Most additional instructional attention was requested for topics raised in discussions with patients concerning the risks, benefits and alternatives to recommended treatments (7.3 ±1.4). The cohort expressed the need for education in the care of vulnerable patients (7.2 ±1.2) with a maximum score for the care of abused children. Women perceived greater need for education concerning informed consent than male respondents (p>0.05). There were significant differences between students who scored high or low on the item “being treated in professional manner” and “endorsement of educational needs for care of adolescents” (p = 0.05). Conclusion There was heightened perception among final year medical students of the need for greater attention to be paid to informed consent education."
https://openalex.org/W2895233466,"A simple cost-effective strategy to pre-screen for targeted HIV testing can have substantial benefit in high burden and resource limited settings. A 4-item (previous hospitalisation, orphanhood, poor health status, and recurring skin problems) screening tool to identify adolescents living with HIV has previously shown high sensitivity in healthcare facility settings. We validated this screening tool in a community setting, in Harare, Zimbabwe in a community-based HIV prevalence survey.A community-based HIV prevalence survey was conducted among individuals aged 8-17 years with guardian consent and child assent and residing in 7 communities during the period February 2015 to December 2015. Participants without previously diagnosed HIV were evaluated for the probability of having HIV using the screening tool. HIV status was defined using an anonymous HIV test which was done using Oral Mucosal Transudate (OMT). A questionnaire was also administered to ascertain self-reported HIV status and screening tool items. The validity of a 4-item screening tool was tested. Sensitivity and specificity of the screening tool was assessed against the HIV status based on OMT result.Prevalence survey participants were 5386 children who had an HIV test result, aged 8-17 years. However, 5384, who did not report testing HIV positive and responded to all screening tool item questions were included in the validation. Their median age was 12 (IQR: 10-15) years, 2515 (46.7%) were male. HIV prevalence was 1.3% (95% CI:1.0-1.8%). The 4-item screening tool had poor accuracy with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.65(95% CI: 0.60-0.72) at a cut-off score≥1. Its sensitivity was 56.3% (95% CI:44.0-68.1%) and specificity of 75.1% (95% CI:73.9-76.3%), PPV of 2.9% (95% CI:2.1-3.9%) and a NPV of 99.2% (95% CI:98.9-99.5%). The number needed to test to diagnose one child using the screening tool was 55% lower than universal testing for HIV.Use of the 4-item screening tool could be a strategy that can be adopted to identify children living with HIV in a community setting in resource limited settings by reducing the number needed to test compared to universal testing since it is inexpensive, easy to administer and not harmful. However, screening items adapted to a community setting need to be explored to improve the performance of the screening tool."

In particular, the administration of the D2 antagonist haloperidol produces a state that is similar to catalepsy. In order to confirm whether the modulation of the dopaminergic activity produced by haloperidol can act as an unconditioned stimulus, we carried out two experiments in which the administration of haloperidol was repeatedly paired with the presence of distinctive contextual cues that served as a Conditioned Stimulus. Paradoxically, the results revealed a dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity following conditioning with dopamine antagonist (Experiments 1) that was susceptible of extinction when the conditioned stimulus was presented repeatedly by itself after conditioning (Experiment 2). These data are interpreted from an associative perspective, considering them as a result of a classical conditioning process."

The purpose of this study was to explore the geographical variations and influential factors of cardiometabolic disease prevalence with respect to 230 administrative districts in South Korea. Global Moran's I was calculated to determine whether the standardized prevalences of cardiometabolic diseases (hypertension, stroke, and diabetes mellitus) were spatially clustered. The CART algorithm was then applied to generate decision tree models that could extract the diseases' regional influential factors from among 101 demographic, economic, and public health data variables. Finally, the accuracies of the resulting model-hypertension (67.4%), stroke (62.2%), and diabetes mellitus (56.5%)-were assessed by ten-fold cross-validation. Marriage rate was the main determinant of geographic variation in hypertension and stroke prevalence, which has the possibility that married life could have positive effects in lowering disease risks. Additionally, stress-related variables were extracted as factors positively associated with hypertension and stroke. In the opposite way, the wealth status of a region was found to have an influence on the prevalences of stroke and diabetes mellitus. This study suggested a framework for provision of novel insights into the regional characteristics of diseases and the corresponding influential factors. The results of the study are anticipated to provide valuable information for public health practitioners' cost-effective disease management and to facilitate primary intervention and mitigation efforts in response to regional disease outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2895063211,"Background The employment rate among people with severe mental illness has recently increased, though it is still low. The motivation to work appears to be an important role as an intermediate outcome measure in vocational rehabilitation programs. In addition, measuring the work motivation for people with severe mental illness appears to be essential to identify candidates who are likely to benefit and monitor candidates’ motivation in a supported employment program. This study aimed to develop a new measure for assessing both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to work among people with severe mental illness, as there are currently no well-established instruments of this kind. Methods A focus group interview and review of previous qualitative research were used to identify possible items for inclusion in the new scale. A provisional scale was constructed and further refined for content and format based on feedback from a researcher and also three peer workers with severe mental illness. The resulting provisional 38-item version of the scale was completed by 136 respondents with severe mental illness, and we performed exploratory factor analysis to identify latent constructs within the new measure. The finalized scale was analyzed for test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and convergent validity. Result An exploratory factor analysis yielded a four-factor scale with 23 items. The finalized 23 items had high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.91) and relatively high test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.83). The four subscales had fair internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ≥ 0.69) and good test-retest reliability (ICC ≥ 0.61). Convergent validity was weakly supported by the significant positive correlations with the overall question on motivation to work (r ≥ 0.19, p < 0.01). Besides these correlations, only the “Pressure from others” subscale was negatively and significantly correlated with the negative symptoms evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (r = -0.18, p = 0.04). Conclusions This study used factor analysis to develop a new multidimensional scale assessing motivation for competitive employment among persons with severe mental illness. The scale showed acceptable levels of reliability and factor-based and convergent validity. The new measure can be used for measuring the motivation for competitive employment among people with severe mental illness, and it would be useful to identify candidates who are likely to benefit from a certain supported employment program, and to monitor interim progress of the state of participants’ motivation in a program."

Gestational age at the initial antenatal care booking was established from their medical cards. Further researcher-administered questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions was used. Key informant interviews with traditional birth attendants (n = 6) and maternal and child health nursing officers (n = 6) were also conducted for triangulation. Descriptive statistics were applied using SPSS programme. The interviews of women who gave consent to be audio recorded (n = 52) were transcribed and thematically analysed using MAXQDA program, based on Andersen and Newman's (1973) behavioural model of health services utilization.The mean gestational age at booking initial biomedical care was 23.36 weeks. Only 18 patients (10%) booked before 13 weeks and 45% made four or more visits. The main reasons given for early booking were: illness in index pregnancy (42%) checking the foetus position and monitoring foetus progress (7%). The main reasons given for late booking were: no reason (31%), was not feeling sick (16%), fear or shame due to unexpected pregnancy (13%). Almost half of the respondents (44%) used both biomedical and traditional antenatal care services. Main reasons for visiting traditional care were to: check foetus position and reposition it (63%), collect medicinal herbs (31%), relief discomforts through massage (18%).Early antenatal care booking is meant for women with unpleasant physical signs and symptoms. Later ANC is meant to check foetus position and reposition it to cephalic presentation and monitor its progress and this is only possible if the foetus is large."
https://openalex.org/W2894591783,"In the backdrop of global warming, Antarctic sea-ice variability showed an overall expansion with the regional heterogeneity of increasing and decreasing patterns. Analysis of satellite derived sea-ice extent, during 1979 to 2015, in the Indian Ocean sector of Antarctica (IOA) revealed expansion of 2.4±1.2% decade-1. We find strengthening of westerly wind during the austral summer (between 50°S to 62°S) facilitated northward advection of a cool and fresh layer. Also, the strong westerly wind cools the upper ocean due to net heat loss from the ocean surface. The combined effect of northward advection of cold fresh layer and net heat loss from the surface, favours sea-ice expansion in the subsequent seasons, in the IOA region, north of 62°S. However, sea-ice retreat was observed near the Kerguelen Plateau, due to upper ocean warming, and hence a non-annular pattern of sea-ice extent in the IOA was observed."

Majority of commercial serological tests use F. hepatica native antigens and indicate wide diversities in test accuracy. Nowadays, recombinant antigens have been introduced as diagnostic reagents offer better test standardization. A combination of highly pure recombinant antigens associated with correct folding will leads to improve specificity and sensitivity of ELISA for diagnosis of Fascioliasis. In this article, Fasciola hepatica saposin-like protein 2 (SAP-2), ferritin protein (Ftn-1) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) recombinant antigens were considered as tools for the detection of F. hepatica immunoglobulin G antibodies in persons with chronic human fasciolasis. The recombinant antigens were obtained as fusion proteins, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The refolding processes of denatured recombinant proteins were performed using dialysis method in the presence of chemical additives, and reduced/oxidized glutathione (in vitro). The immunoreactivity of the recombinant antigens was assessed individually and in a combination compared with excretory/secretory antigen (E/S) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. The experiments were optimized using 213 serum samples from humans, including patients with chronic fascioliasis, patients with other parasitic diseases, and healthy subjects. The results indicated 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity for rtFhSAP-2, 96% sensitivity and 91% specificity for E/S, 80% and 83.3% for rtFhFtn-1, 84% and 88% for FhLAP, and also, 96% and 95% for combination of recombinant antigens, respectively. In conclusion, the results of this investigation showed that rtFhSAP-2 with the highest specificity and acceptable sensitivity has a considerable superiority compared to mentioned antigens and even in combination with these antigens in serodiagnosis of human fascioliasis."
https://openalex.org/W2895736962,"The aims of this study were to investigate (1) whether and (2) the extent to which Taiwanese older adults' leisure time activity (LTA) trajectories mediated the potential association between their sociodemographic factors and their functional disability trajectories.Longitudinal data from four waves of the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA), collected between 1996 and 2007, were used for analysis (N = 3,429). Parallel-process latent growth curve modeling was adopted to evaluate the process by which LTA mediated between sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, self-rated health, comorbidities, and depression) and the outcome process of functional disabilities.When mediated by baseline level of LTA, five sociodemographic factors-age, gender, education level, self-rated health, and number of comorbidities-had significant and negative mediating effects on baseline or change in functional disability, thus improving disability outcomes. However, four of the sociodemographic factors (age, education level, and number of comorbidities), when mediated through the rate of change in LTA, were found to have significant and positive mediating effects, which increased disability levels. The proportion of effects mediated by the LTA trajectory ranged from 0% to 194%.The large proportion of effects mediated through the LTA process underlines the importance of LTA to public health policy and health programs for older adults. The study's findings shed light on how to better target populations of older adults to promote an active lifestyle and achieve more successful aging in late life in Asian countries."
https://openalex.org/W4240521589,"The performances of different types of banks may vary due to heterogeneous technology, which can be examined by metafrontier analysis. However, the metafrontier constructed in most existing literature is concave, resulting in a biased estimation of efficiency. Based on 93 Chinese commercial banks over the period of 2005–2016, we first evaluate the banking efficiency by using the proposed data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, NCMeta-US-NSBM, which simultaneously incorporates a non-concave metafrontier technique, undesirable outputs, and super efficiency into a network slacks-based measure (NSBM) model. Subsequently, the evolution of banking efficiency during the study period is investigated on the basis of the Dagum Gini index and kernel density estimation methods. The main empirical results show the following. 1) There exists significant disparity/heterogeneity in banking efficiency for overall efficiency, productivity efficiency, and profitability efficiency. 2) The results of the technology gap ratio (TGR) and the evaluation of stated-owned banks (SOB), joint-stock banks (JSB), and city commercial banks (CCB) in the productivity stage are higher than those in the profitability stage, indicating that most of the banks have a large space for improvement, especially for SOB and JSB in the profitability stage. 3) The major contribution of the overall difference of banking efficiency in China is the intensity of the transvariation. 4) Although the kernel density estimations for different efficiency scores have similar distributions in corresponding years, the multilevel differentiation phenomenon of banking efficiency may appear after 2008."
https://openalex.org/W2895129477,"The detection and quantification of leukemia-associated fusion gene transcripts play important roles in the diagnosis and follow-up of leukemias. To establish a standardized method without interlaboratory discrepancies, we developed a novel one-step reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay, called “the Eprobe leukemia assay,” for major and minor BCR-ABL1, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and various isoforms of PML-RARA. This assay is comprised of Eprobes that are exciton-controlled hybridization-sensitive fluorescent oligonucleotides. Melting curve analyses were performed on synthetic quantitative standard RNAs with strict quality control. Quantification capacity was evaluated by comparison with TaqMan RT-qPCR using 67 primary leukemia patient samples. The lower limit of detection and the limit of quantification of this assay were less than 31.3 copies/reaction and 62.5 copies/reaction, respectively. This assay correctly detected the fusion genes in samples with 100% sensitivity and specificity. The specificity of the reactions was confirmed by melting curve analyses. The assay detected low-level expression of minor BCR-ABL1 co-expressed with major BCR-ABL1. These results illustrate the feasibility and high accuracy of the Eprobe leukemia assay, even for minimal residual disease monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2895535739,"Purpose To investigate the difference between sonographic findings in extensor pollicis longus tendons rupture and other finger tendons rupture in patients sustaining hand and wrist trauma. Methods Twenty-four patients who presented with signs and symptoms clinically suspicious for tendon injury and surgically confirmed tendon rupture were included in this study. We analyzed 6 sonographic features: discontinuity of the tendon, pseudomass formation, decreased echogenicity of the tendon, retraction of the ruptured tendon, fluid collection within the tendon sheath, and the motion of the tendon. We compared the sonographic features of ruptured extensor pollicis longus tendons with the other ruptured finger tendons. Results Discontinuity of the tendon was the most common sonographic findings and retraction of the ruptured tendon was the second most common findings. Fourteen of 16 cases with a dynamic study on sonography showed loss of normal motion of the tendon. Pseudomass formation was the second most common feature in ruptured extensor pollicis longus tendons, in contrast to the other ruptured finger tendons (p < 0.05). Conclusion Using ultrasonography, detection of discontinuity of the tendon, retraction of the ruptured tendon, and limitation of tendon motion could be very helpful for diagnosing a tendon rupture in hand and wrist trauma. Pseudomass formation could be more specific for diagnosing extensor pollicis longus tendon ruptures compared with other finger tendons."
https://openalex.org/W2950579873,"Calcium (Ca) absorption from the intestinal tract is promoted by active vitamin D (1α,25D3). Vitamin D not only promotes Ca homeostasis, but it also inhibits bone resorption and promotes osteogenesis, thus playing a role in the maintenance of normal bone metabolism. Because 1α,25D3 plays an important role in osteogenesis, vitamin D formulations, such as alfacalcidol (ALF) and eldecalcitol (ELD), are used for treating osteoporosis. While it is known that, in contrast to ALF, ELD is an active ligand that directly acts on bone, the reason for its superior osteogenesis effects is unknown. Cyp27b1-knockout mice (Cyp27b1-/-mice) are congenitally deficient in 1α,25D3 and exhibit marked hypocalcemia and high parathyroid hormone levels, resulting in osteodystrophy involving bone hypocalcification and growth plate cartilage hypertrophy. However, because the vitamin D receptor is expressed normally in Cyp27b1-/-mice, they respond normally to 1α,25D3. Accordingly, in Cyp27b1-/-mice, the pharmacological effects of exogenously administered active vitamin D derivatives can be analyzed without being affected by 1α,25D3. We used Cyp27b1-/-mice to characterize and clarify the superior osteogenic effects of ELD on the bone in comparison with ALF. The results indicated that compared to ALF, ELD strongly induces ECaC2, calbindin-D9k, and CYP24A1 in the duodenum, promoting Ca absorption and decreasing the plasma concentration of 1α,25D3, resulting in improved osteogenesis. Because bone morphological measurements demonstrated that ELD has stronger effects on bone calcification, trabecular formation, and cancellous bone density than ALF, ELD appears to be a more effective therapeutic agent for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis, in which cancellous bone density decreases markedly. By using Cyp27b1-/-mice, this study was the first to succeed in clarifying the osteogenic effect of ELD without any influence of endogenous 1α,25D3. Furthermore, ELD more strongly enhanced bone mineralization, trabecular proliferation, and cancellous bone density than did ALF. Thus, ELD is expected to show an effect on postmenopausal osteoporosis, in which cancellous bone mineral density decreases markedly. In the future, this study may enable the development of next-generation active vitamin D derivatives with higher affinity for bone than ELD."
https://openalex.org/W2805580777,"Classical clustering algorithms typically either lack an underlying probability framework to make them predictive or focus on parameter estimation rather than defining and minimizing a notion of error. Recent work addresses these issues by developing a probabilistic framework based on the theory of random labeled point processes and characterizing a Bayes clusterer that minimizes the number of misclustered points. The Bayes clusterer is analogous to the Bayes classifier. Whereas determining a Bayes classifier requires full knowledge of the feature-label distribution, deriving a Bayes clusterer requires full knowledge of the point process. When uncertain of the point process, one would like to find a robust clusterer that is optimal over the uncertainty, just as one may find optimal robust classifiers with uncertain feature-label distributions. Herein, we derive an optimal robust clusterer by first finding an effective random point process that incorporates all randomness within its own probabilistic structure and from which a Bayes clusterer can be derived that provides an optimal robust clusterer relative to the uncertainty. This is analogous to the use of effective class-conditional distributions in robust classification. After evaluating the performance of robust clusterers in synthetic mixtures of Gaussians models, we apply the framework to granular imaging, where we make use of the asymptotic granulometric moment theory for granular images to relate robust clustering theory to the application."
https://openalex.org/W2895512013,"This study aimed to determine sediment contamination in the Beidagang Wetland Nature Reserve to describe atmospheric deposition of trace metals. We analyzed Hg, Cd, Pb, TOC, TN, TP, δ13C, and δ15N, and studied their variations in surface sediments and in the vertical profiles of sediment cores collected from the reserve. Evaluation of environmental trace metal contamination using sediment quality guidelines and geochemical background values indicated that the risk of metal pollution in the reserve sediments was relatively low. Concentrations of Hg, Cd, and Pb in the sediments were much lower than concentrations in sediment samples from Bohai Bay and polluted rivers in Tianjin. Enrichment factors indicate that samples are moderately contaminated with Hg, Cd, and Pb; whereas the geo-accumulation index results classify the sediments as uncontaminated to moderately contaminated with Hg, Cd, and Pb. The distribution patterns of trace metal concentrations in the three core samples were uniform. δ13C and δ15N were used to track the sources of TOC and TN in sediments. Results show that TOC mainly originated from the residue and decaying matter of aquatic plants (e.g., algae, reeds, and Typha), while TN was derived from soil N and elevated atmospheric N deposition. Because domestic and industrial waste is not discharged into the Beidagang Wetland Nature Reserve, trace metals found in sediments mainly originate from atmospheric deposition. The results provide baseline data for analysis of trace metal accumulation in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, a region subject to atmospheric deposition in northern China."
https://openalex.org/W2895582536,"Modern CT scanners provide automatic dose adjustment systems, which are promising options for reducing radiation dose in pediatric CT scans. Their impact on patient dose, however, has not been investigated sufficiently thus far.To evaluate automated tube voltage selection (ATVS) in combination with automated tube current modulation (ATCM) in non-contrast pediatric chest CT, with regard to the diagnostic image quality.There were 160 non-contrast pediatric chest CT scans (8.7±5.4 years) analyzed retrospectively without and with ATVS. Correlations of volume CT Dose Index (CTDIvol) and effective diameter, with and without ATVS, were compared using Fisher's z-transformation. Image quality was assessed by mean signal-difference-to-noise ratios (SDNR) in the aorta and in the left main bronchus using the independent samples t-test. Two pediatric radiologists and a general radiologist rated overall subjective Image quality. Readers' agreement was assessed using weighted kappa coefficients. A p value <0.05 was considered significant.CTDIvol correlation with the effective diameter was r = 0.62 without and r = 0.80 with ATVS (CI: -0.04 to -0.60; p = 0.025). Mean SDNR was 10.88 without and 10.03 with ATVS (p = 0.0089). Readers' agreement improved with ATVS (weighted kappa between pediatric radiologists from 0.1 (0.03-0.16) to 0.27 (0.09-0.45) with ATVS; between general and each pediatric radiologist from 0.1 (0.06-0.14) to 0.12 (0.05-0.20), and from 0.22 (0.11-0.34) to 0.36 (0.24-0.49)).ATVS, combined with ATCM, results in a radiation dose reduction for pediatric non-contrast chest CT without a loss of diagnostic image quality and prevents errors in manual tube voltage setting, and thus protecting larger children against an unnecessarily high radiation exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2895035299,"Activation studies with positron emission tomography (PET) in auditory implant users explained some of the mechanisms underlying the variability of achieved speech comprehension. Since future developments of auditory implants will include studies in rodents, we aimed to inversely translate functional PET imaging to rats. In normal hearing rats, activity in auditory and non-auditory regions was studied using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET with 3 different acoustic conditions: sound attenuated laboratory background, continuous white noise and rippled noise. Additionally, bilateral cochlea ablated animals were scanned. 3D image data were transferred into a stereotaxic standard space and evaluated using volume of interest (VOI) analyses and statistical parametric mapping (SPM). In normal hearing rats alongside the auditory pathway consistent activations of the nucleus cochlearis (NC), olivary complex (OC) and inferior colliculus (IC) were seen comparing stimuli with background. In this respect, no increased activation could be detected in the auditory cortex (AC), which even showed deactivation with white noise stimulation. Nevertheless, higher activity in the AC in normal hearing rats was observed for all 3 auditory conditions against the cochlea ablated status. Vice versa, in ablated status activity in the olfactory nucleus (ON) was higher compared to all auditory conditions in normal hearing rats. Our results indicate that activations can be demonstrated in normal hearing animals based on 18F-FDG PET in nuclei along the central auditory pathway with different types of noise stimuli. However, in the AC missing activation with respect to the background advises the need for more rigorous background noise attenuation for non-invasive reference conditions. Finally, our data suggest cross-modal activation of the olfactory system following cochlea ablation-underlining, that 18F-FDG PET appears to be well suited to study plasticity in rat models for cochlear implantation."
