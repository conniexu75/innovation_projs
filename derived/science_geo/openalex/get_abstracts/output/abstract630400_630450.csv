https://openalex.org/W2930043270,"Microstructure imaging techniques based on tensor-valued diffusion encoding have gained popularity within the MRI research community. Unlike conventional diffusion encoding-applied along a single direction in each shot-tensor-valued encoding employs diffusion encoding along multiple directions within a single preparation of the signal. The benefit is that such encoding may probe tissue features that are not accessible by conventional encoding. For example, diffusional variance decomposition (DIVIDE) takes advantage of tensor-valued encoding to probe microscopic diffusion anisotropy independent of orientation coherence. The drawback is that tensor-valued encoding generally requires gradient waveforms that are more demanding on hardware; it has therefore been used primarily in MRI systems with relatively high performance. The purpose of this work was to explore tensor-valued diffusion encoding on clinical MRI systems with varying performance to test its technical feasibility within the context of DIVIDE. We performed whole-brain imaging with linear and spherical b-tensor encoding at field strengths between 1.5 and 7 T, and at maximal gradient amplitudes between 45 and 80 mT/m. Asymmetric gradient waveforms were optimized numerically to yield b-values up to 2 ms/μm2. Technical feasibility was assessed in terms of the repeatability, SNR, and quality of DIVIDE parameter maps. Variable system performance resulted in echo times between 83 to 115 ms and total acquisition times of 6 to 9 minutes when using 80 signal samples and resolution 2×2×4 mm3. As expected, the repeatability, signal-to-noise ratio and parameter map quality depended on hardware performance. We conclude that tensor-valued encoding is feasible for a wide range of MRI systems-even at 1.5 T with maximal gradient waveform amplitudes of 33 mT/m-and baseline experimental design and quality parameters for all included configurations. This demonstrates that tissue features, beyond those accessible by conventional diffusion encoding, can be explored on a wide range of MRI systems."
https://openalex.org/W2930127373,"Background Existing prediction models for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) require manual chart abstraction and have only fair performance–limiting their suitability for driving clinical interventions. We sought to develop a machine learning approach for the prediction of ARDS that (a) leverages electronic health record (EHR) data, (b) is fully automated, and (c) can be applied at clinically relevant time points throughout a patient’s stay. Methods and Findings We trained a risk stratification model for ARDS using a cohort of 1,621 patients with moderate hypoxia from a single center in 2016, of which 51 patients developed ARDS. We tested the model in a temporally distinct cohort of 1,122 patients from 2017, of which 27 patients developed ARDS. Gold standard diagnosis of ARDS was made by intensive care trained physicians during retrospective chart review. We considered both linear and non-linear approaches to learning the model. The best model used L2-logistic regression with 984 features extracted from the EHR. For patients observed in the hospital at least six hours who then developed moderate hypoxia, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73–0.88). Selecting a threshold based on the 85th percentile of risk, the model had a sensitivity of 56% (95% CI: 35%, 74%), specificity of 86% (95% CI: 85%, 87%) and positive predictive value of 9% (95% CI: 5%, 14%), identifying a population at four times higher risk for ARDS than other patients with moderate hypoxia and 17 times the risk of hospitalized adults. Conclusions We developed an ARDS prediction model based on EHR data with good discriminative performance. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a machine learning approach to risk stratifying patients for ARDS solely from data extracted automatically from the EHR."
https://openalex.org/W2931743436,"Background Mitochondrial disease is a family of genetic disorders characterized by defects in the generation and regulation of energy. Epilepsy is a common symptom of mitochondrial disease, and in the vast majority of cases, refractory to commonly used antiepileptic drugs. Ferroptosis is a recently-described form of iron- and lipid-dependent regulated cell death associated with glutathione depletion and production of lipid peroxides by lipoxygenase enzymes. Activation of the ferroptosis pathway has been implicated in a growing number of disorders, including epilepsy. Given that ferroptosis is regulated by balancing the activities of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) and 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), targeting these enzymes may provide a rational therapeutic strategy to modulate seizure. The clinical-stage therapeutic vatiquinone (EPI-743, α-tocotrienol quinone) was reported to reduce seizure frequency and associated morbidity in children with the mitochondrial disorder pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6. We sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism of EPI-743 and explore the potential of targeting 15-LO to treat additional mitochondrial disease-associated epilepsies. Methods Primary fibroblasts and B-lymphocytes derived from patients with mitochondrial disease-associated epilepsy were cultured under standardized conditions. Ferroptosis was induced by treatment with the irreversible GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 or a combination of pharmacological glutathione depletion and excess iron. EPI-743 was co-administered and endpoints, including cell viability and 15-LO-dependent lipid oxidation, were measured. Results EPI-743 potently prevented ferroptosis in patient cells representing five distinct pediatric disease syndromes with associated epilepsy. Cytoprotection was preceded by a dose-dependent decrease in general lipid oxidation and the specific 15-LO product 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). Conclusions These findings support the continued clinical evaluation of EPI-743 as a therapeutic agent for PCH6 and other mitochondrial diseases with associated epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2924763979,"Background Protein energy wasting (PEW) is a risk factor for death. However, the cutoff vales for PEW are not optimized for early identification of hemodialysis patients with malnutrition. We evaluated the prognosis of Japanese maintenance hemodialysis patients using nutritional indices optimized for them. Materials and methods We analyzed data from a nation-wide prospective cohort study of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy Renal Data Registry to develop and validate a nutritional risk index (n = 48349, 48349, respectively). The association of nutritional factors with one-year death was tested using Cox proportional hazards models. Their cutoff levels were determined from the hazard ratios or receiver operating characteristic curves. Then, risk index was developed using scoring models. Results Male was 61.4%; average age, 65.7±12.2 years; and diabetes mellitus, 32.8%. Four clinical factors were retained in the final model: low BMI (<20kg/m2), yes = 3, no = 0; low serum albumin level (young <3.7g/dL; old <3.5g/dL), yes = 4, no = 0; abnormal serum total cholesterol level, low (<130mg/dL) = 1, high (220≥mg/dL) = 2, no = 0; low serum creatinine level (young female, <9.7mg/dL; old female, <8.0mg/dL; young male, <11.6mg/dL; old male, <9.7mg/dL), yes = 4, no = 0. In the validation dataset, medium- and high-risk groups (total score 8 to 10; 11 or more) showed a higher risk of all-cause death than the low-risk group (0 to 7): medium-risk group (10.5%), hazard ratio adjusted for baseline characteristics 1.96 (95% confidence interval 1.77, 2.16); high-risk group (8.2%), 3.91 (3.57, 4.29). The medium- and high-risk groups also showed a higher risk of cardiovascular disease- and infection-caused deaths than the low-risk group. Conclusion We developed a new nutritional risk index for hemodialysis patients, which may detect patients with malnutrition with a high-risk of death."
https://openalex.org/W2927859328,"Hand grip strength (HGS) is a means to assess health status and physical abilities indirectly. Various factors are known to be related to HGS, but data on the factors influencing HGS in the Korean population are lacking. Recently, the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed social status, nutrition, physical status, and other medical history including HGS. This study aimed to investigate the social, physical, and individual health behavior factors associated with low HGS in the elderly Korean population. This population-based cross-sectional study was based on the 2014–2016 KNHANES. Community-dwelling Korean elderly (aged ≥65 years) were included in this survey. The relationship between HGS and socioeconomic status, nutrition, exercise, and other clinical characteristics were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. The sample size was 3,634 (weighted: 6,006,406). Elderly men and women with low HGS showed lower body mass index, reduced physical activity and lower education level. Among elderly men, excessive carbohydrate and inadequate protein intake were observed in the low HGS group. Meanwhile, older women who did not drink alcohol and had diabetes were at higher risk of low HGS. In conclusion, various physical, nutritional, socioeconomic and comorbidity statuses were seemed to be the factors associated with HGS in Korean elderly. However, further cohort or case-control study will be necessary to determine the causal relationship of those factors and HGS."
https://openalex.org/W2934070878,"Television (TV) programming attracts ever-growing audiences and dominates the cultural zeitgeist. Viewership and social media engagement have become standard indices of programming success. However, accurately predicting individual episode success or future show performance using traditional metrics remains a challenge. Here we examine whether TV viewership and Twitter activity can be predicted using electroencephalography (EEG) measures, which are less affected by reporting biases and which are commonly associated with different cognitive processes. 331 participants watched an hour-long episode from one of nine prime-time shows (~36 participants per episode). Three frequency-based measures were extracted: fronto-central alpha/beta asymmetry (indexing approach motivation), fronto-central alpha/theta power (indexing attention), and fronto-central theta/gamma power (indexing memory processing). All three EEG measures and the composite EEG score significantly correlated across episode segments with the two behavioral measures of TV viewership and Twitter volume. EEG measures explained more variance than either of the behavioral metrics and mediated the relationship between the two. Attentional focus was integral for both audience retention and Twitter activity, while emotional motivation was specifically linked with social engagement and program segments with high TV viewership. These findings highlight the viability of using EEG measures to predict success of TV programming and identify cognitive processes that contribute to audience engagement with television shows."
https://openalex.org/W2926668486,"Autonomous Vehicles (AV) technology is emerging. Field tests on public roads have been on going in several states in the US as well as in Europe and Asia. During the US public road tests, crashes with AV involved happened, which becomes a concern to the public. Most previous studies on AV safety relied heavily on assessing drivers’ performance and behaviors in a simulation environment and developing automated driving system performance in a closed field environment. However, contributing factors and the mechanism of AV-related crashes have not been comprehensively and quantitatively investigated due to the lack of field AV crash data. By harnessing California’s Report of Traffic Collision Involving an Autonomous Vehicle Database, which includes the AV crash data from 2014 to 2018, this paper investigates by far the most current and complete AV crash database in the US using statistical modeling approaches that involve both ordinal logistic regression and CART classification tree. The quantitative analysis based on ordinal logistic regression and CART models has successfully explored the mechanism of AV-related crash, via both perspectives of crash severity and collision types. Particularly, the CART model reveals and visualize the hierarchical structure of the AV crash mechanism with knowledge of how these traffic, roadway, and environmental contributing factors can lead to crashes of various serveries and collision types. Statistical analysis results indicate that crash severity significantly increases if the AV is responsible for the crash. The highway is identified as the location where severe injuries are likely to happen. AV collision types are affected by whether the vehicle is on automated driving mode, whether the crashes involve pedestrians/cyclists, as well as the roadway environment. The method used in this research provides a proven approach to statistically analyze and understand AV safety issues. And this benefit is potential be even enhanced with an increasing sample size of AV-related crashes records in the future. The comprehensive knowledge obtained ultimately facilitates assessing and improving safety performance of automated vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W2928060632,"In the present study, we investigated whether both adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) and osteogenic-induced ADSC sheets could promote bone healing in a rat distal femoral metaphysis bone defect model. A through-hole defect of 1 mm diameter was drilled into each distal femur of 12 week old rats. Forty-five rats were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) control group; (2) ADSC sheet group; or (3) osteogenic-induced ADSC sheet group. We evaluated each group by analysis of computerized tomography scans every week after the surgery, histological analysis, and DiI labeling (a method of membrane staining for post implant cell tracing). Radiological and histological evaluations showed that a part of the hole persisted in the control group at four weeks after surgery, whereas the hole was restored almost completely by new bone formation in both sheet groups. The mean value of bone density (in Houndsfield units) for the bone defect area was significantly higher in both sheet groups than that in the control group (p = 0.05) at four weeks postoperative. A large number of osteocalcin positive osteoblasts were observed at the area of bone defect, especially in the osteogenic-induced ADCS sheet group. DiI labeling in the newly formed bone showed that each sheet had differentiated into bone tissue at four weeks after surgery. The ADSC and the osteogenic-induced ADSC sheets promoted significantly quicker bone healing in the bone defect. Moreover, the osteogenic-induced ADSC sheet may be more advantageous for bone healing than the ADSC sheet because of the higher number of osteocalcin positive osteoblasts via the transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2928599172,"Introduction The epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of hospitalized adult patients with Influenza A (FluA), Influenza B (FluB) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) have not been thoroughly compared. The aim of this study was to describe the differences between these viruses during 3 winter seasons. Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted consisting of all the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnoses of FluA, FluB and RSV among adults during 2015–2018, in one regional hospital. Epidemiology, clinical symptoms and outcome-related data were comparatively analyzed. Results Between November 2015 and April 2018, 759 patients were diagnosed with FluA, FluB or RSV. Study cohort included 539 adult patients (306 FluA, 148 FluB and 85 RSV). FluB was predominant during the winter of 2017–18. RSV caused 15.7% of hospitalizations with diagnosed viral infection and in comparison to influenza, had distinct epidemiological, clinical features and outcomes, including older age (74.2 vs 66.2, p = 0.001) and higher rates of co-morbidities; complications including bacterial pneumonia (31 vs 18%, p = 0.02), mechanical ventilation (20 vs 7%, p = 0.001), and viral-related death (13 vs 6.6%, p = 0.04). FluA and FluB had similar epidemiology, clinical symptoms and outcomes, but vaccinated patients were less prone to be hospitalized with FluB as compared with FluA (3 vs 14%, p = 0.001). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and falls were common (8.7 and 8.5% respectively). Conclusions FluA and FluB had similar epidemiological, clinical features and contributed equally to hospitalization burden and complications. RSV had a major impact on hospitalizations, occurring among the more elderly and sick populations and causing significantly worse outcomes, when compared to influenza patients. Vaccination appeared as a protective factor against hospitalizations with FluB as compared with FluA."

Social and economic characteristics are some of the key determinants of health and utilization family planning. However, studies examining the factors associated with utilization of long acting reversible contraception (LARC) are limited in Nepal. This study assessed the factors associated with utilization of LARC methods among married women of reproductive age in Nepal. Secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). A logistic regression model examined the association of socioeconomic, demographic, or fertility related characteristics with the use of LARCs among 9875 ever married women of reproductive age. The overall utilization rate of LARC in this study was 4.7%. Women in the age group of <25 years (AOR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.45–0.92) and 25–35 years (AOR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56–0.89), having husbands with primary education (AOR:0.71; 95%CI: 0.64–0.84) and no education (AOR: 0.54; 95%CI: 0.38–0.73), belonging to Janajatis (AOR: 0.55; 95%CI: 0.42–0.71) and Newars (AOR: 0.29; 95%CI: 0.19–42), poor wealth quintile (AOR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45–0.86) had negative association with LARC use. On the other hand, women having their husband as a skilled worker (AOR: 1.49; 95%CI: 1.10–2), having two or less than two children (AOR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.15–1.186), and having desire for children in future (AOR: 3.24; 95% CI: 2.29–4.57) had positive association with the use of LARC. In this study, younger women’s age, low or no husband’s education, from indigenous community such as Janajati and Newer, being in lowest wealth quintile negatively influenced the use of LARC. Conversely, women having her husband as skilled worker, parity less than two, and desire of having future children, positively influenced the use of LARC. The study highlights the need to reach women who were in the lower socioeconomic background to improve LARC use."
https://openalex.org/W2933961826,"Objective Delay discounting (DD) is the choice of a smaller immediate reward over a larger delayed reward, which has been associated with a number of maladaptive behaviors. Episodic future thinking (EFT), the ability to project oneself into the future, is an intervention designed to reduce DD. EFT has reliable effects on DD, but the size of the effect varies, which could be due in part to the use of different control groups. Episodic thinking (ERT) serves as a common control for many EFT studies, but the temporal window of recent cues ranges from 24 hours ago to 12 days past. Since prior research has shown that retrospection can lead to prospection, it may be important to ensure that EFT controls do not inadvertently lead to prospection for some participants thereby increasing the variability of the control condition. The present study sought to develop a comparison group that standardizes the time frame and experiences that are the basis for the thinking control. Methods Participants (n = 53, 18-45) were randomized to one of three conditions: EFT, ERT, or standardized episodic thinking (SET). Participants attended a laboratory appointment where they played mobile application games, created cues, and completed a DD task. Results There was a significant difference between groups (p 0.05). Conclusion This study established that SET provides an alternative control in EFT studies and provides the advantage of standardizing the participant's experience without changing the relationship between EFT and thinking controls."
https://openalex.org/W2934706211,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been on the forefront of inflammatory disorder research and has yielded many promising results. Questions remain, however, about the biological mechanisms of such treatments and the inconsistencies in the methods used in research efforts. Here, we aimed to clarify the inflammatory response to intraperitoneal (IP) injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats, while analyzing corresponding effects of electrical stimulation to subdiaphragmatic branches (anterior gastric, accessory celiac, and hepatic) of the left vagus nerve. We accomplished an in-depth characterization of the time-varying cytokine cascade response in the serum of 58 rats to an acute IP LPS challenge over a 330-minute period by utilizing curve-fitting and starting point-alignment methods. We then explored the post-LPS neuromodulation effects of electrically stimulating individually cuffed subdiaphragmatic branches. Through our analysis, we found there to be a consistent order of IP LPS cytokine response (IL-10, TNF-α, GM-CSF, IL-17F, IL-6, IL-22, INF-γ). Apart from IL-10, the IP cytokine cascade was more variable in starting time and occurred later than in previously recorded intravenous (IV) challenges. We also found distinct regulatory effects on multiple cytokine levels by each of the three subdiaphragmatic stimulation subsets. While the time-variability of IP LPS use in rats complicates its utility, we have shown it to be a practical, arguably more physiologically relevant method than IV in rats when our methods are used. More importantly, we have shown that selective subdiaphragmatic neurostimulation can be utilized to selectively induce specific effects on inflammation in the body."
https://openalex.org/W2934737189,"The pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infects over 600 species of plant. It is present in numerous environments throughout the world and causes significant damage to many agricultural crops. Fragmentation and lack of gene flow between populations may lead to population sub-structure. Within discrete recombining populations, positive selection may lead to a ‘selective sweep’. This is characterised by an increase in frequency of a favourable allele leading to reduction in genotypic diversity in a localised genomic region due to the phenomenon of genetic hitchhiking. We aimed to assess whether isolates of S. sclerotiorum from around the world formed genotypic clusters associated with geographical origin and to determine whether signatures of population-specific positive selection could be detected. To do this, we sequenced the genomes of 25 isolates of S. sclerotiorum collected from four different continents–Australia, Africa (north and south), Europe and North America (Canada and the northen United States) and conducted SNP based analyses of population structure and selective sweeps. Among the 25 isolates, there was evidence for two major population clusters. One of these consisted of 11 isolates from Canada, the USA and France (population 1), and the other consisted of nine isolates from Australia and one from Morocco (population 2). The rest of the isolates were genotypic outliers. We found that there was evidence of outcrossing in these two populations based on linkage disequilibrium decay. However, only a single candidate selective sweep was observed, and it was present in population 2. This sweep was close to a Major Facilitator Superfamily transporter gene, and we speculate that this gene may have a role in nutrient uptake from the host. The low abundance of selective sweeps in the S. sclerotiorum genome contrasts the numerous examples in the genomes of other fungal pathogens. This may be a result of its slow rate of evolution and low effective recombination rate due to self-fertilisation and vegetative reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2935654744,"Polypharmacy among older patients has been associated with a decline in their quality of life. We aimed to assess the medication-related quality of life (MRQOL) among older patients with polypharmacy at Gondar University Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia. A prospective cross-sectional study was carried out among 150 elder patients who had visited the internal medicine ward and ambulatory ward of Gondar referral hospital from March 25 to May 15, 2017, using a validated scale, Medication-Related Quality of Life Scale version 1.0 (MRQoLS-v1.0). A total of 150 older patients with polypharmacy participated in the study with a mean age of 70.06±5.12, andtwo-thirds of the participants (67.3%) were female. The overall prevalence of poor quality of life due to polypharmacy in the current study was found to be three fourth (75.3%) of the participants. Regarding the severity of impairment in MRQoL, Univariate analysis revealed that frequency of hospital visits (COR = 1.34, 95% CI, 1.02-1.77) and medication number (COR = 1.94, 95% CI, 1.33, 2.8) had a statistically significant positive association with the likelihood of having a severe impairment.The multivariate analysis also showed that one unit increase in the number of hospital visits (AOR = 1.45, 95% CI, 1.040-2.024) and medications greater than 5 (AOR = 1.91, 95% CI, 1.29, 2.84) increases 1.45 and 1.91 times the likely hood of posing severe impairment of MRQoL, respectively. As far as poor MRQoL quality of life is concerned, multivariate analysis did not show any significant association between the poor MRQoL;and Sociodemographic and clinical data of patients. The poor QoL associated with medication was very high in this study. Deprescribing should be sought by the health care providers to optimize drug therapy and minimize the polypharmacy related poor quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2928666462,"The purpose of the research was to obtain new derivatives of natural triterpene lupeol and to evaluate their potential as active substances in the treatment of skin damage. Four new lupeol esters (propionate, succinate, isonicotinate and acetylsalicylate) and lupeol acetate were obtained using an eco-friendly synthesis method. In the esterification process, the commonly used hazardous reagents in this type of synthesis were replaced by safe ones. This unconventional, eco-friendly, method is particularly important because the compounds obtained are potentially active substances in skin care formulations. Even trace amounts of hazardous reagents can have a toxic effect on damaged or irritated tissues. The molecular structure of the esters were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and IR spectroscopy methods. Their crystal structures were determined using XRD method. To complete the analysis of their characteristics, physicochemical properties (melting point, lipophilicity, water solubility) and biological activity of the lupeol derivatives were studied. Results of an irritant potential test, carried out on Reconstructed Human Epidermis (RHE), confirmed that the synthesized lupeol derivatives are not cytotoxic and they stimulate a process of human cell proliferation. The safety of use for tested compounds was determined in a cell viability test (cytotoxicity detection kit based on the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity) for keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The results obtained showed that the modification of lupeol structure improve its bioavailability and activity. All of the esters penetrate the stratum corneum and the upper layers of the dermis better than the maternal lupeol. Lupeol isonicotinate, acetate and propionate were the most effective compounds in a stimulation of the human skin cell proliferation process. This combination resulted in an increase in the concentration of cells of more than 30% in comparison to control samples. The results indicate that the chemical modification of lupeol allows to obtain promising active substances for treatment of skin damage, including thermal, chemical and radiation burns."

However, many people consider this information private and are reluctant to share it. In this paper, we show that income is predictable from the digital footprints people leave on Facebook. Applying an established machine learning method to an income-representative sample of 2,623 U.S. Americans, we found that (i) Facebook Likes and Status Updates alone predicted a person’s income with an accuracy of up to r = 0.43, and (ii) Facebook Likes and Status Updates added incremental predictive power above and beyond a range of socio-demographic variables (ΔR2 = 6–16%, with a correlation of up to r = 0.49). Our findings highlight both opportunities for businesses and legitimate privacy concerns that such prediction models pose to individuals and society when applied without individual consent."
https://openalex.org/W2934343349,"Aim Characterizing tumor heterogeneity with textural indices extracted from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT) is of growing interest in oncology. Several series showed promising results to predict survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), analyzing various tumor segmentation methods and textural indices. This preliminary study aimed at assessing the inter-observer and inter-segmentation method variability of textural indices in HNSCC pre-therapeutic FDG PET/CT. Materials and methods Consecutive patients with HNSCC referred in our department for a pre-therapeutic FDG PET/CT from January to March 2016 were retrospectively included. Two nuclear medicine physicians separately segmented all tumors using 3 different segmentation methods: a relative standardized uptake value (SUV) threshold (40%SUVmax), a signal-to-noise adaptive SUV threshold (DAISNE) and an image gradient-based method (PET-EDGE). SUV and metabolic tumor volume were recorded. Thirty-one textural indices were calculated using LIFEx software (www.lifexsoft.org). After correlation analysis, selected indices’ inter-segmentation method and inter-observer variability were calculated. Results Forty-three patients (mean age 63.8±9.3y) were analyzed. Due to a too small segmented tumor volume of interest, textural analysis could not be performed in 6, 11 and 15 cases with respectively DAISNE, 40%SUVmax and PET-EDGE segmentation methods. Five independent textural indices were selected (Homogeneity, Correlation, Entropy, Busyness and LZLGE). There was a high inter-contouring method variability for Homogeneity, Correlation, Entropy and LZLGE (p<0.0001 for each index). The inter-observer reproducibility analysis revealed an excellent agreement for 3 indices (Homogeneity, Correlation and Entropy) with an intraclass correlation coefficient higher than 0.90 for the 3 methods. Conclusions This preliminary study showed a high variability of 4 out of 5 textural indices (Homogeneity, Correlation, Entropy and LZLGE) extracted from pre-therapeutic FDG PET/CT in HNSCC using 3 different contouring methods. However, for each method, there was an excellent agreement between observers for 3 of these textural indices (Homogeneity, Correlation and Entropy)."
https://openalex.org/W2926968628,"The input of plant leaf litter has been assumed to be the most important resource for soil organisms of forest ecosystems, but there is increasing evidence that root-derived resources may be more important. By trenching roots of trees in deciduous and coniferous forests, we cut-off the input of root-derived resources and investigated the response of microorganisms using substrate-induced respiration and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. After one and three years, root trenching strongly decreased microbial biomass and concentrations of PLFAs by about 20%, but the microbial community structure was little affected and the effects were similar in deciduous and coniferous forests. However, the reduction in microbial biomass varied between regions and was more pronounced in forests on limestone soils (Hainich) than in those on sandy soils (Schorfheide). Trenching also reduced microbial biomass in the litter layer but only in the Hainich after one year, whereas fungal and bacterial marker PLFAs as well as the fungal-to-plant marker ratio in litter were reduced in the Schorfheide both after one and three years. The pronounced differences between forests of the two regions suggest that root-derived resources are more important in fueling soil microorganisms of base-rich forests characterized by mull humus than in forests poor in base cations characterized by moder soils. The reduction in microbial biomass and changes in microbial community characteristics in the litter layer suggests that litter microorganisms do not exclusively rely on resources from decomposing litter but also from roots, i.e. from resources based on labile recently fixed carbon. Our results suggest that both bacteria and fungi heavily depend on root-derived resources with both suffering to a similar extent to deprivation of these resources. Further, the results indicate that the community structure of microorganisms is remarkably resistant to changes in resource supply and adapts quickly to new conditions irrespective of tree species composition and forest management."
https://openalex.org/W2931073836,"In temperate regions goat’s reproduction is seasonal. To obtain year-round breeding, hormonal treatments are currently applied. These treatments usually combine a progesterone analog with the pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). However, their use has significant ethical and environmental drawbacks. Therefore, alternative methods to manage reproduction are needed. The discovery that in mammals the neuropeptide kisspeptin is a major positive regulator of hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis offered an attractive alternative strategy to control reproduction. We have previously designed a kisspeptin analog, called C6, which offers pharmacological advantages over endogenous kisspeptin. These include a longer lasting effect and enhanced activity following intramuscular injection. In the present work, we evaluated C6 effect on LH and FSH plasma concentrations in the Alpine goat breed and tested whether C6 could replace PMSG to trigger ovulation. An intramuscular injection of C6 (15 nmol/doe) given 24 hours after the end of progestogen treatment induced a surge-like peak of both LH and FSH. This was followed by an increase of progesterone, a hallmark of ovulation induction and corpus luteus formation. These results were obtained at three different time of the year: during the breeding season, the non-breeding season and at the onset of the breeding season. Furthermore, we compared the efficacy of C6 and PMSG to induce fertile ovulations when these treatments are given at the onset of the breeding season and are followed by artificial insemination. The results of this first attempt were extremely promising with gestation rates of 45% and 64% for C6 and PMSG respectively. Pending optimization of the treatment procedure in order to improve efficacy, kisspeptin analogs could be the long sought-after alternative to PMSG."

This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of cytoskeletal alteration of CAFs and its role in invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma(OSCC).Immortalized normal fibroblasts(hTERT-hNOFs) co-cultured with OSCC cells showed myofibroblastic and senescent phenotypes like CAFs. Thus, this study substituted hTERT-hNOFs for CAFs. Next, the cytoskeletal alteration and its molecular mechanism were investigated in hTERT-hNOFs co-cultured with OSCC. As results, we found that RhoA regulated cytoskeletal organization in fibroblasts surrounding OSCC cells. Furthermore, as a downstream transcriptional factor of RhoA, YAP was mainly localized in the nucleus of hTERT-hNOFs co-cultured with OSCC. Consequently, we examined whether nuclear YAP localization of fibroblasts could influence cancer progression. YAPS127A fibroblasts manifesting nuclear localization of YAP induced cytoskeletal alteration and increased gel contractility and matrix stiffness, and thereby enhances the invasiveness of OSCC cells. In conclusion, the modification of tumor microenvironment, such as cytoskeletal change and matrix remodeling via RhoA-YAP in CAFs, modulates OSCC invasion. These understandings will provide the development of novel approaches for CAFs-based cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2925834405,"Background Persistent left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in patients with acute lymphocytic myocarditis (LM) is widely unexplored. Objectives To assess the frequency and predictors of persistent LV dysfunction in patients with LM and reduced LVEF at admission. Methods and results We retrospectively evaluated 89 consecutive patients with histologically-proven acute myocarditis enrolled at three Italian referral hospitals. A subgroup of 48 patients with LM, baseline systolic impairment and an available echocardiographic assessment at 12 months (6–18) from discharge constituted the study population. The primary study end-point was persistent LV dysfunction, defined as LVEF <50% at 1-year, and was observed in 27/48 patients (56.3%). Higher LV end-diastolic diameter at admission (odds ratio [OR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.43, p = 0.002), non-fulminant presentation (OR 8.46, 95% CI 1.28–55.75, p = 0.013) and presence of a poor lymphocytic infiltrate (OR 12.40, 95% CI 1.23–124.97, p = 0.010) emerged as independent predictors of persistent LV dysfunction at multivariate analysis (area under the curve 0.91, 95% CI 0.82–0.99). Pre-discharge LVEF was lower in patients with persistent LV dysfunction compared to the others (32%±8 vs. 53%±8, p <0.001), and this single variable showed the best accuracy in predicting the study end-point (area under the curve 0.95, 95% CI 0.89–1.00). Conclusions More than half of patients presenting with acute LM and LVEF <50% who survive the acute phase show persistent LV dysfunction after 1-year from hospital discharge. Features of subacute inflammatory process and of established myocardial damage at initial hospitalization emerged as predictors of this end-point."
https://openalex.org/W2932111545,"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a widely distributed pathogen responsible for acute upper and lower respiratory infections of varying severity. Previously, we reported that N-sulfonated derivatives of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (NSPAHs) efficiently inhibit replication of the influenza virus in vitro and ex vivo. Here, we show a dose dependent inhibition of hMPV infection by NSPAHs in LLC-MK2 cells. The results showed strong antiviral properties of NSPAHs. While the activity of NSPAHs is comparable to those of carrageenans, they show better physicochemical properties and may be delivered at high concentrations. The functional assays showed that tested polymers block hMPV release from infected cells and, consequently, constrain virus spread. Moreover, further studies on viruses utilizing different egress mechanisms suggest that observed antiviral effect depend on selective inhibition of viruses budding from the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2925311376,"Rye (Secale cereale L.) is known for its wide adaptation due to its ability to tolerate harsh environments in semiarid areas. To assess the diversity in rye we genotyped a panel of 178 geographically diverse accessions of four Secale sp. from U.S. National Small Grains Collection using 4,037 high-quality SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) developed by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). PCA and STRUCTURE analysis revealed three major clusters that separate S. cereale L. from S. strictum and S. sylvestre, however, genetic clusters did not correlate with geographic origins and growth habit (spring/winter). The panel was evaluated for response to Pyrenophora tritici-repentis race 5 (PTR race 5) and nearly 59% accessions showed resistance or moderate resistance. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on S. cereale subsp. cereale using the 4,037 high-quality SNPs. Two QTLs (QTs.sdsu-5R and QTs.sdsu-2R) on chromosomes 5R and 2R were identified conferring resistance to PTR race 5 (p < 0.001) that explained 13.1% and 11.6% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. Comparative analysis showed a high degree of synteny between rye and wheat with known rearrangements as expected. QTs.sdsu-2R was mapped in the genomic region corresponding to wheat chromosome group 2 and QTs.sdsu-5R was mapped to a small terminal region on chromosome 4BL. Based on the genetic diversity, a set of 32 accessions was identified to represents more than 99% of the allelic diversity with polymorphic information content (PIC) of 0.25. This set can be utilized for genetic characterization of useful traits and genetic improvement of rye, triticale, and wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2928945553,"Background There is a substantial gap in health and longevity between more affluent and more deprived areas, and more knowledge of the determinants of this health divide is required. Experience of the local residential environment is important for health although few studies have examined this in relation to biological markers of age such as telomere length. We sought to examine if residents’ perceptions of neighbourhood stressors over time were associated with telomere length in a community study. Methodology/Principal findings In a prospective cohort study of 2186 adults in the West of Scotland, we measured neighbourhood stressors at three time points over a 12-year period and telomere length at the end of the study. Using linear regression models, we found that a higher accumulation of neighbourhood stressors over time was associated with shorter telomere length, even after taking cohort, social class, health behaviours (smoking status, diet, physical activity), BMI and depression into account among females only (Beta = 0.007; 95%CI [0.001, 0.012]; P<0.014). Conclusions/Significance Neighborhood environments are potentially modifiable, and future efforts directed towards improving deleterious local environments may be useful to lessen telomere attrition."
https://openalex.org/W2932887347,"Early-age exposure to noise may have long-term health implications of which we have little knowledge of today. Age-specific hearing, learning inadequate coping strategies, and alterations in biological stress regulatory responses could play a role in the long-term health impacts. In Sweden about half a million children in the age between 1–5 years attend preschool. The noise exposure at preschools is intermittent and unpredictable and levels reach up to 84 dB LAeq (time indoors) with maximum levels of 118 dB LAF, mostly due to child activity. To increase the overall understanding of the possible implications of preschool noise environments for children, this paper describes children’s behavioral and emotional reactions to and coping with their everyday sound environment from a teachers perspective. A postal questionnaire study performed in 2013–2014 with answers from 3,986 preschool teachers provided the data. Content analysis was combined with quantitative analysis. Eighty-two percent of the personnel considered that children’s behavior was affected rather or very much by preschool noise. The most prevalent behaviors were categorized into: be heard, be distracted, show negative internal emotions, crowd, avoid, withdraw, be exhausted, and learning. The quantitative analyses confirmed an association between the perceived loudness and noise annoyance at preschool and affirmative reporting on noise affecting the children´s behavior. Age of the personnel, with the youngest age group reporting noise related behavior less often, and age distribution of the class, with 1–5 years old seeming less affected by noise, were also indicated, while pedagogic orientation was not a significant factor. Future studies should address the long-term health effects of these behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2927609055,"Measurement of fore and pelvic limb alignment in veterinary orthopedics is significant, as it is in human medicine. The establishment of reference ranges for alignments and comparing measured ranges in diseased animals to these reference values would allow veterinarians to specify the quantitative degree of an angular deformity, plan suitable treatments and evaluate treatment outcomes. Patellar luxation is a common orthopedic disease in small animal clinics. Severe grades of MPL may present with bone deformities or abnormal alignments; therefore, evaluation of the measurement methods of femoral and tibial alignment in dogs with different grades of patellar luxation to assess the accuracy and reliability of the measurements could be useful. In this retrospective study radiographs of 21 client-owned Chihuahuas that had been presented to the Small Animal Surgery of Vetmeduni Vienna from 2012–2016 with a diagnose of patellar luxation were selected. The measurements were performed on frontal, lateral and axial view radiographs to determine the femoral and tibial angles and to evaluate the intra- and inter-observer variabilities of the protocol. Radiographs of each dog were investigated by three observers. Intra-observer variability was based on measurements by each observer who repeated the protocol two times to evaluate repeatability. Inter-observer variability was based on the measurements between the three observers to evaluate the reproducibility of the protocol. The results of the study showed that 92.85% of inter-observer ICC (intra-class correlation coefficient) had high correlation, and the remaining 7.15% had good correlation. Intra-observer ICCs for measurements of the first observer were 28.57% high correlation and 50% good correlation. For the second observer, 100% high correlation was recorded, and for the third observer 71.42% high correlation and 14.28% good correlation was recorded. These results show that the selected methods have high correlation and could be used as a reliable method in veterinary orthopedics."
https://openalex.org/W2927135983,"Heatwaves have been linked to increased risk of mortality and morbidity and are projected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change. The current study uses emergency department (ED) data from Australia, Botswana, Netherlands, Pakistan, and the United States of America to evaluate the impact of heatwaves on ED attendances, admissions and mortality.Routinely collected time series data were obtained from 18 hospitals. Two separate thresholds (≥4 and ≥7) of the acclimatisation excess heat index (EHIaccl) were used to define ""hot days"". Analyses included descriptive statistics, independent samples T-tests to determine differences in case mix between hot days and other days, and threshold regression to determine which temperature thresholds correspond to large increases in ED attendances.In all regions, increases in temperature that did not coincide with time to acclimatise resulted in increases in ED attendances, and the EHIaccl performed in a similar manner. During hot days in California and The Netherlands, significantly more children ended up in the ED, while in Pakistan more elderly people attended. Hot days were associated with more patient admissions in the ages 5-11 in California, 65-74 in Karachi, and 75-84 in The Hague. During hot days in The Hague, patients with psychiatric symptoms were more likely to die. The current study did not identify a threshold temperature associated with particularly large increases in ED demand.The association between heat and ED demand differs between regions. A limitation of the current study is that it does not consider delayed effects or influences of other environmental factors. Given the association between heat and ED use, hospitals and governmental authorities should recognise the demands that heat can place on local health care systems. These demands differ substantially between regions, with Pakistan being the most heavily affected within our study sample."
https://openalex.org/W2931898201,"The Cytolethal Distending Toxin (CDT) is produced by many pathogenic bacteria. CDT is known to induce genomic DNA damage to host eukaryotic cells through its catalytic subunit, CdtB. CdtB is structurally homologous to DNase I and has a nuclease activity, dependent on several key residues. Yet some differences between various CdtB subunit activities, and discrepancies between biochemical and cellular data, have been observed. To better characterise the role of CdtB in the induction of DNA damage, we affinity-purified wild-type and mutants of CdtB, issued from E. coli and H. ducreyi, under native and denaturing conditions. We then compared their nuclease activity by a classic in vitro assay using plasmid DNA, and two different eukaryotic assays–the first assay where host cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding CdtB, the second assay where host cells were directly transfected with purified CdtB. We show here that in vitro nuclease activities are difficult to quantify, whereas CdtB activities in host cells can be easily interpreted and confirmed the loss of function of the catalytic mutant. Our results highlight the importance of performing multiple assays while studying the effects of bacterial genotoxins, and indicate that the classic in vitro assay should be complemented with cellular assays."

CD4 count increase below 200 cells/μL after two years on cART was used to define INR (immunological non-responder) patients. Polymorphisms in CXCL12, CCL5 and CCR2 genes were genotyped using sequenom's MassARRAY platform.Thirty two percent (134/412) of patients were classified as INR. After adjusting by age, route of HIV infection, length of infection before cART and viral hepatitis coinfection, CCR2 rs1799864-AG genotype was significantly associated with INR status (OR [95% CI]: 1.80 [1.04-3.11]; p = 0.04), and CXCL12 rs1801157-TT genotype showed a trend (OR [95% CI]: 2.47 [0.96-6.35]; p = 0.06).CCR2 rs1799864-AG or CXCL12 rs1801157-TT genotypes influence on the probability of poor CD4 recovery in the population of HIV patients starting cART with low CD4 counts.

https://openalex.org/W2934712772,"Situated in southeastern Sierra Leone, Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) maintains one of the world's only Lassa fever isolation wards and was a strategic Ebola virus disease (EVD) treatment facility during the 2014 EVD outbreak. Since 2006, the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (VHFC) has carried out research activities at KGH, capturing clinical and laboratory data for suspected cases of Lassa fever. Here we describe the approach, progress, and challenges in designing and maintaining a data capture and management system (DCMS) at KGH to assist infectious disease researchers in building and sustaining DCMS in low-resource environments. Results on screening patterns and case-fatality rates are provided to illustrate the context and scope of the DCMS covered in this study. A medical records system and DCMS was designed and implemented between 2010 and 2016 linking historical and prospective Lassa fever data sources across KGH Lassa fever units and its peripheral health units. Data were captured using a case report form (CRF) system, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate readers, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines, blood chemistry analyzers, and data auditing procedures. Between 2008 and 2016, blood samples for 4,229 suspected Lassa fever cases were screened at KGH, ranging from 219 samples in 2008 to a peak of 760 samples in 2011. Lassa fever case-fatality rates before and following the Ebola outbreak were 65.5% (148/226) and 89.5% (17/19), respectively, suggesting that fewer, but more seriously ill subjects with Lassa fever presented to KGH following the 2014 EVD outbreak (p = .040). DCMS challenges included weak specificity of the Lassa fever suspected case definition, limited capture of patient survival outcome data, internet costs, lapses in internet connectivity, low bandwidth, equipment and software maintenance, lack of computer teaching laboratories, and workload fluctuations due to variable screening activity. DCMS are the backbone of international research efforts and additional literature is needed on the topic for establishing benchmarks and driving goal-based approaches for its advancement in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2950162320,"Serum response factor and its cofactor myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) are key elements of muscle-mass adaptation to workload. The transcription of target genes is activated when MRTF is present in the nucleus. The localization of MRTF is controlled by its binding to G-actin. Thus, the pathway can be mechanically activated through the mechanosensitivity of the actin cytoskeleton. The pathway has been widely investigated from a biochemical point of view, but its mechanical activation and the timescales involved are poorly understood. Here, we applied local and global mechanical cues to myoblasts through two custom-built set-ups, magnetic tweezers and stretchable substrates. Both induced nuclear accumulation of MRTF-A. However, the dynamics of the response varied with the nature and level of mechanical stimulation and correlated with the polymerization of different actin sub-structures. Local repeated force induced local actin polymerization and nuclear accumulation of MRTF-A by 30 minutes, whereas a global static strain induced both rapid (minutes) transient nuclear accumulation, associated with the polymerization of an actin cap above the nucleus, and long-term accumulation, with a global increase in polymerized actin. Conversely, high strain induced actin depolymerization at intermediate times, associated with cytoplasmic MRTF accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2949348163,"Because of the increasing threat that Zika virus (ZIKV) poses to more sub-tropical area due to increased global travel, there is a need for better understanding of the effect(s) of temperature on the establishment potential of ZIKV within these subtropical, temperate, and/or seasonal Ae. aegypti populations. The first step to determining risk establishment of ZIKV in these regions is to assess ZIKV's ability to infect mosquitoes at less tropical temperatures, and thus be detected through common surveillance programs. To that end, the effect of two rearing temperatures (RT) and extrinsic incubation temperatures (EIT) on infection and dissemination rates was evaluated, as well as the interactions of such. Total, there were four combinations (RT24-EIT24, RT24-EIT28, RT28-EIT24, RT28-EIT28). Further, a stochastic SEIR framework was adapted to determine whether observed data could lead to differential success of establishment of ZIKV in naive mosquito populations. There was no consistent pattern in significant differences found across treatments for either infection or dissemination rates (p>0.05), where only a significant difference was found in infection rates between RT24-EIT24 (44%) and RT28-EIT24 (82.6%). Across all temperature conditions, the model predicted between a 76.4% and 95.4% chance of successful establishment of ZIKV in naive mosquito populations under model assumptions. We further show that excluding the maximum observed infection and dissemination rates likely overestimates the probability of local establishment of ZIKV. These results indicate that 1) there is no straightforward relationship between RT, EIT, and infection/dissemination rates, 2) in more temperate climates, ZIKV may still have the ability to establish in populations of Aedes aegypti, 3) despite an overall lack of significant differences in infection/dissemination rates, temperature may still alter the kinetics of ZIKV within the mosquito enough to affect the likelihood of infection establishment and detection within the context of mosquito surveillance programs, and 4) both the temporal and magnitude qualities of vector competence are necessary for parameterization of within-mosquito virus kinetics."

In this study, a genome-wide association study for coronary artery calcification (CAC) was performed in a Korean population-based sample of 400 subjects without prior coronary artery disease and replicated in another of 1,288 subjects. CAC score, as assessed by multi-detector computed tomography, was evaluated in volunteers for screening purposes as part of a routine health examination. CAC score greater than the 90th percentile across the age in each sex group was considered severe CAC. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with severe CAC after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, and diabetes were investigated using the additive model of logistic regression. One SNP (rs10757272 in the intronic region of the CDKN2B-AS1 gene in chromosome 9p21.3) met Bonferroni correction in the discovery set (p = 7.55E-08) and was also significant in the validation set by TaqMan assay (p = 0.036). Subjects with rs10757272 were found to have an increased odds ratio (OR) of having severe CAC in multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, and diabetes (adjusted OR 3.24 and 95% CI 2.11–4.97). In conclusion, SNP rs10757272 in chromosome 9p21.3 was associated with severe CAC based on age and sex in an asymptomatic community-based Korean population. Therefore, it was associated with promotion of coronary artery calcification in subclinical state."
https://openalex.org/W2931515131,"Background Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in primary care and leads to a high number of antibiotic prescriptions. Antimicrobial resistance is a global health problem; better antimicrobial prescribing is one way to limit antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to describe the number of consultations for patients diagnosed with lower urinary tract infection (LUTI) and pyelonephritis and changes in prescribing of antibiotics to men and women with LUTI and pyelonephritis in Swedish PHC between the years 2008 and 2013. Methods We performed a descriptive study of changes in UTI diagnosis and antibiotic prescribing in UTI for the years 2008, 2010 and 2013. The Primary Care Record of Infections in Sweden, a database regarding diagnosis linked antibiotic prescribing in primary care, was analyzed concerning data for men and women of all ages regarding UTI visits and antibiotic prescribing. The results were analyzed in relation to current national guidelines. Results There was a variability in consultation incidence for LUTI with an increase between 2008 and 2010 and a decrease between 2010 and 2013, resulting in a slight rise in consultation incidence between 2008 and 2013. The use of recommended nitrofurantoin or pivmecillinam in LUTI in women increased from 54% in 2008 to 69% in 2013. Fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim were prescribed in 24% of LUTI cases in women in 2008 and in 7% of cases in 2013. Prescriptions of pivmecillinam or nitrofurantoin in male LUTI cases increased from 13% in 2008 to 31% in 2013. Fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim were prescribed in 54% of male LUTI cases in 2008 and 32% in 2013. Conclusions Swedish GPs seem to follow national guidelines in the treatment of LUTI in women. In male LUTI cases, the prescriptions of fluoroquinolones remain high and further research is needed to follow prescription patterns and enhance more prudent prescribing to this group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2933494280,"Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a severe glomerulopathy that frequently leads to end stage renal disease. Only a subset of patients responds to current therapies, making it important to identify alternative therapeutic options. The interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist anakinra is beneficial in several diseases with renal involvement. Here, we evaluated the potential of anakinra for FSGS treatment. Molecular process models obtained from scientific literature data were used to build FSGS pathology and anakinra mechanism of action models by exploiting information on protein interactions. These molecular models were compared by statistical interference analysis and expert based molecular signature matching. Experimental validation was performed in Adriamycin- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nephropathy mouse models. Interference analysis (containing 225 protein coding genes and 8 molecular process segments) of the FSGS molecular pathophysiology model with the drug mechanism of action of anakinra identified a statistically significant overlap with 43 shared molecular features that were enriched in pathways relevant in FSGS, such as plasminogen activating cascade, inflammation and apoptosis. Expert adjudication of molecular signature matching, focusing on molecular process segments did not suggest a high therapeutic potential of anakinra in FSGS. In line with this, experimental validation did not result in altered proteinuria or significant changes in expression of the FSGS-relevant genes COL1A1 and NPHS1. In summary, an integrated bioinformatic and experimental workflow showed that FSGS relevant molecular processes can be significantly affected by anakinra beyond the direct drug target IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1) context but might not counteract central pathophysiology processes in FSGS. Anakinra is therefore not suggested for extended preclinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2922876661,"We estimated the effect of oligosaccharide supplementation and feed restriction on calves. The study was divided into two experimental periods of 28 days each with 20 crossbred calves that had initial body weight of 37 Kg and housed in individual pens. The animals were split in four experimental groups: animals fed 6 L milk/day (CON) in the two periods, animals fed milk restricted (3 L milk/day) in the first period and followed by CON feeding in the second period (RES), animals receiving supplementation of 5 g/day of mannanoligosaccharide (MOS) and animals receiving supplementation of 5 g/day mannan and frutoligosaccharide (MFOS). At the end of the study, all the animals were slaughtered. The average weight gain was lower in the restricted group when compared with CON and MFOS groups in the first period (P < 0.05) and there were no difference among the groups in the second period. Animals supplemented with MOS showed a significant increases in jejunal villus height and rumen papillae, which were not observed for MFOS group (P < 0.05) compared with RES and CON groups. There were no difference in ghrelin and leptin levels among treatments during periods 1 and 2 (P > 0.05). Also, the expression of ghrelin receptors in the paraventricular region of the hypothalamus did not differ among groups. We conclude that milk restriction during the first weeks of life in calves resulted in compensatory gain and did not modify the hormonal profile and expression of the ghrelin receptor in the hypothalamus. Moreover, a prebiotic supplementation changed the development of intestinal and ruminal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2928870184,"Background and objective The idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) are diffuse parenchymal lung disorders that are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and disease stratification of IIP patients are important because these are related with the treatment and prognosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) are two major distinctive pathologic patterns of pulmonary fibrosis. We researched the application of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) to the respiratory system and compared the pulmonary acinus mechanics and functions in healthy and IIP models. Methods The human pulmonary alveolus is idealized by a three-dimensional honeycomb-like geometry, and a fluid-structure interaction analysis is performed to study the normal and diseased breathing mechanics. The computational domain consists of two generations of alveolar ducts within the pulmonary acinus, with alveolar geometries approximated as closely packed 14-sided polygons. Findings In a normal breathing cycle, the flow rate of the healthy model is significantly larger than that of the NSIP and IPF models. Similar trends are observed for the volume change and the maximum pressure drop. The flow rate and the volume change of the NSIP are almost the same as those of IPF. The maximum pressure drop of NSIP is 5.5% larger than that of IPF. There is a 47% decrease in the pulmonary acinus compliance for the NSIP and IPF compared with that of the healthy model. The acinus resistances of NSIP and IPF are higher than those of the healthy lung by 6.4~11.2%. In particular, the pulmonary acinus resistance of the NSIP lung is higher than that of the IPF lung by 4.5%. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the differences of air flow and lung function in the pulmonary acinus between the healthy and the IIP models. These changes in the lung are important considerations for early diagnosis and disease stratification in patients. Patient-based geometry can to be included in the computational models in future studies."

Two species of Aspergillus (A. flavus and A. fumigatus) and three species of Fusarium (F. falciforme, F. keratoplasticum, and F. proliferatum) were the most common fungi isolated and identified from FK horses. Most (91%) equine FK Fusarium nested within the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) with nine genetically diverse strains/lineages, while 83% of equine FK Aspergillus nested within the A. flavus clade with three genetically diverse lineages. Fungal species and evolutionary lineage were not associated with clinical outcome. However, species of equine FK Fusarium were more likely (p = 0.045) to be associated with stromal keratitis. Species of Aspergillus were more susceptible to voriconazole and terbinafine than species of Fusarium, while species of Fusarium were more susceptible to thiabendazole than species of Aspergillus. At the species level, A. fumigatus and A. flavus were more susceptible to voriconazole and terbinafine than F. falciforme. Natamycin susceptibility was higher for F. falciforme and A. fumigatus compared to A. flavus. Furthermore, F. falciforme was more susceptible to thiabendazole than A. flavus and A. fumigatus. These observed associations of antifungal sensitivity to natamycin, terbinafine, and thiabendazole demonstrate the importance of fungal identification to the species rather than genus level. The results of this study suggest that treatment of equine FK with antifungal agents requires accurate fungal species identification."

A total of 4.73 × 108 raw reads were obtained from nine brain samples. De novo transcriptome assembly identified 387,085 unigenes with 2.1×109 nucleotides. A total of 936 annotated unigenes showed significantly differential expression among the control, fasting, and fasting-refeeding groups. The down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during fasting were mainly associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, and mitosis. The up-regulated DEGs were mainly related to glucose and lipid metabolism, material transportation, and transcription factors. Most decreased DEGs during fasting were restored to normal levels after refeeding. Comparing with the control group, genes associated with protein synthesis, stimulus response, and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly over-expressed and pro-opio melanocortin (POMC) was down-regulated during the refeeding period. In conclusion, fish mobilized stored energetic materials and reduced energy consumption to prolong survival during fasting. After refeeding, the down-regulation of DEGs, e.g., POMC may be associated with compensatory growth. Up-regulation of DEGs related to ribosomal protein, stimulus response, and carbohydrate metabolism may contribute to eliminate negative effect of starvation on brain. This study provided the first transcriptome data related with impact of short-time starvation and refeeding in S. hollandi brains."
https://openalex.org/W2931166606,"Sputum often contains large amounts of contaminating bacterial DNA that, if not eliminated during RNA isolation, may interfere with gene expression studies. During RNA isolation only repeated DNase treatment can effectively remove contaminating bacterial DNA from samples, but this compromises RNA quality. In this study we tested alternative methods to facilitate the removal of DNA and improve the quality of RNA obtained. Sputum samples obtained from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were processed with dithiothreitol and subjected to various RNA isolation methods, yet with modified protocols. Modifications included prolonged DNase treatment or vortexing of sputum cells in the presence of beads prior to RNA isolation. Bacterial DNA contamination was tested by PCR using universal bacterial primers, while RNA quality was assessed by real-time PCR using GAPDH primers for amplicons of different length. We found that the RNeasy Plus Mini kit equipped with the gDNA eliminator spin column was able to completely eliminate bacterial DNA, if sputum cells were lysed in the presence of bashing beads. Notably, compared with the standard protocol, the modified procedure yielded better quality RNA as well, as indicated by improved threshold profiles of qPCR. Bead vortexing of cells was less effective when combined with other RNA isolation methods, and the repeated DNase treatment needed to completely remove contaminating DNA from the samples reduced the quality of RNA markedly. Bead vortexing in combination with certain RNA extraction methods greatly facilitates the isolation of sputum RNA that is free of contaminating bacterial DNA, and is suitable for downstream applications."
https://openalex.org/W2929831620,"Nitrate [Formula: see text] pollution of surface and groundwater systems is a major problem globally. For some time now wetlands have been considered potential systems for improving water quality. Nitrate dissolved in water moving through wetlands can be removed through different processes, such as the denitrification process, where heterotrophic facultative anaerobic bacteria use [Formula: see text] for respiration, leading to the production of nitrogen (N2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. Nitrate removal and emission of N2O in wetlands can vary spatially, depending on factors such as vegetation, hydrology and soil structure. This study intended to provide a better understanding of the spatial variability and processes involved in [Formula: see text] removal and emission of N2O in riparian wetland soils. We designed a laboratory experiment simulating surface water flow through soil columns collected from different sites dominated by different plant species within a wetland. Water and gas samples for [Formula: see text] and N2O analyses were collected every 5 days for a period of 30 days. The results revealed significant removal of [Formula: see text] in all the soil columns, supporting the role of riparian wetland soils in removing nitrogen from surface runoff. Nitrate removal at 0 and 10cm depths in sites dominated by Phragmites australis and Carex schnimdtii was significantly higher than in the site dominated by Calamagrostis epigeio. Nitrous oxide emissions varied spatially and temporally with negative flux observed in sites dominated by P. australis and C. schnimdtii. These results reveal that in addition to the ability of wetlands to remove [Formula: see text], some sites within wetlands are also capable of consuming N2O, hence mitigating not only agricultural nitrate pollution but also climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2933879136,"Copy number variation (CNV) is a major driving factor for genetic variation and phenotypic diversity in animals. To detect CNVs and understand genetic components underlying stress related traits, we performed whole genome re-sequencing of pooled DNA samples of 20 birds each from High Stress (HS) and Low Stress (LS) Japanese quail lines using Illumina HiSeq 2×150 bp paired end method. Sequencing data were aligned to the quail genome and CNVnator was used to detect CNVs in the aligned data sets. The depth of coverage for the data reached to 41.4x and 42.6x for HS and LS birds, respectively. We identified 262 and 168 CNV regions affecting 1.6 and 1.9% of the reference genome that completely overlapped 454 and 493 unique genes in HS and LS birds, respectively. Ingenuity pathway analysis showed that the CNV genes were significantly enriched to phospholipase C signaling, neuregulin signaling, reelin signaling in neurons, endocrine and nervous development, humoral immune response, and carbohydrate and amino acid metabolisms in HS birds, whereas CNV genes in LS birds were enriched in cell-mediated immune response, and protein and lipid metabolisms. These findings suggest CNV genes identified in HS and LS birds could be candidate markers responsible for stress responses in birds."
https://openalex.org/W2923472467,"It is necessary to develop agents other than antimicrobials for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains. Particularly, anti-virulence agents against the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), USA300 clone, is desired due to its high pathogenicity. Here, we investigated the potential anti-virulence effect of Tokiinshi, which is a traditional Japanese medicine (Kampo) used for skin diseases, against the USA300 clone. A growth inhibition assay showed that a conventional dose (20 mg/ml) of Tokiinshi has bactericidal effects against the clinical USA300 clones. Notably, the growth inhibition effects of Tokiinshi against S. epidermidis strains, which are the major constituents of the skin microbiome, was a bacteriostatic effect. The data suggested that Tokiinshi is unlikely to affect skin flora of S. epidermidis. Furthermore, PVL production and the expression of its gene were significantly suppressed in the USA300 clone by a lower concentration (5 mg/ml) of Tokiinshi. This did not affect the number of viable bacteria. Moreover, Tokiinshi significantly suppressed the expression of the agrA gene, which regulates PVL gene expression. For the first time, our findings strongly suggest that Tokiinshi has the potential to attenuate the virulence of the USA300 clone by suppressing PVL production via agrA gene suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2928342854,"Objective To investigate the potential for static upright balance function and brain-blood oxygen parameters to evaluate pilot workload. Methods Phase 1: The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) was used to compare the workloads of real flights with flight simulator simulated flight tasks in 15 pilots (Cohort 1). Phase 2: To determine the effects of workload, 50 cadets were divided equally into simulated flight task load (experimental) and control groups (Cohort 2). The experimental group underwent 2 h of simulated flight tasks, while the control group rested for 2 h. Their static upright balance function was evaluated using balance index-1 (BI-1), before and after the tasks, with balance system posturography equipment and cerebral blood oxygen parameters monitored with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in real time. Sternberg dual-task and reaction time tests were performed in the experimental and control groups before and after the simulated flight tasks. Results (Phase1) There was a significant correlation between the workload caused by real flight and simulated flight tasks (P<0.01), indicating that NASA-TLX scales were also a tool for measuring workloads of the stimulated flight tasks. (Phase 2) For the simulated flight task experiments, the NASA-TLX total scores were significantly different between the two groups (P<0.001) and (pre-to-post) changes of the BI-1 index were greater in the experimental group than in controls (P<0.001). The cerebral blood oxygen saturation levels (rsO2) (P<0.01) and ΔHb reductions (P<0.05) were significantly higher in the experimental, compared to the control group, during the simulated flight task. In contrast to the control group the error rates (P = 0.002) and accuracy (P<0.001) changed significantly in the experimental group after the simulated flight tasks. Conclusions The simulated flight task model could simulate the real flight task load and static balance and NIRS were useful for evaluating pilots’ workload/fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2933747138,"The present study examines the visual recognition of action simulations by finger gestures (ASFGs) produced by sighted and blind individuals. In ASFGs, fingers simulate legs to represent actions such as jumping, spinning, climbing, etc. The question is to determine whether the common motor experience of one’s own body is sufficient to produce adequate ASFGs or whether the possibility to see gestures from others are also necessary to do it. Three experiments were carried out to address this question. Experiment 1 examined in 74 sighted adults the recognition of 18 types of ASFGs produced by 20 blindfolded sighted adults. Results showed that rates of correct recognition were globally very high, but varied with the type of ASFG. Experiment 2 studied in 91 other sighted adults the recognition of ASFGs produced by 10 early blind and 7 late blind adults. Results also showed a high level of recognition with a similar order of recognizability by type of ASFG. However, ASFGs produced by early blind individuals were more poorly recognized than those produced by late blind individuals. In order to match data of recognition obtained with the form that gestures are produced by individuals, two independant judges evaluated prototypical and atypical attributes of ASFG produced by blindfolded sighted, early blind and late blind individuals in Experiment 3. Results revealed the occurrence of more atypical attributes in ASFG produced by blind individuals: their ASFGs transpose more body movements from a character-viewpoint in less agreement with visual rules. The practical interest of the study relates to the relevance of including ASFGs as a new exploratory procedure in tactile devices which are more apt to convey action concepts to blind users/readers."
https://openalex.org/W2898592855,"We propose a funding scheme for theoretical research that does not rely on project proposals, but on recent past scientific productivity. Given a quantitative figure of merit on the latter and the total research budget, we introduce a number of policies to decide the allocation of funds in each grant call. Under some assumptions on scientific productivity, some of such policies are shown to converge, in the limit of many grant calls, to a funding configuration that is close to the maximum total productivity of the whole scientific community. We present numerical simulations showing evidence that these schemes would also perform well in the presence of statistical noise in the scientific productivity and/or its evaluation. Finally, we prove that one of our policies cannot be cheated by individual research units. Our work must be understood as a first step towards a mathematical theory of the research activity."
https://openalex.org/W2925924186,"Purpose The CATheter infections in CHildren (CATCH) trial reported reduced risks of bloodstream infection with antibiotic impregnated compared with heparin-bonded or standard central venous catheters (CVC) in paediatric intensive care. CVC impregnation did not increase the risk of thrombosis which was recorded in 24% of participants. This post-hoc analysis determines the effect of CVC impregnation on the risk of thrombosis leading to CVC removal or swollen limb. Methods We analysed patients in the CATCH trial, blind to CVC allocation, to define clinically relevant thrombosis based on the clinical sign most frequently recorded in patients where the CVC was removed because of concerns regarding thrombosis. In post-hoc, three-way comparisons of antibiotic, heparin and standard CVCs, we determined the effect of CVC type on time to clinically relevant thrombosis, using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results Of 1409 participants with a successful CVC insertion, the sign most frequently resulting in CVC removal was swollen limb (37.6%; 41/109), with lower rates of removal of CVC following 2 episodes of difficulty withdrawing blood or of flushing to unblock the CVC. In intention to treat analyses (n = 1485), clinically relevant thrombosis, defined by 1 or more record of swollen limb or CVC removal due to concerns about thrombosis, was recorded in 11.9% (58/486) of antibiotic CVCs, 12.1% (60/497) of heparin CVCs, and 10.2% (51/502) of standard CVCs. We found no differences in time to clinically relevant thrombosis according to type of CVC. Conclusions We found no evidence for an increased risk of clinically relevant thrombosis in antibiotic impregnated compared to heparin-bonded or standard CVCs in children receiving intensive care."
https://openalex.org/W2929151041,"Risky decision making can be biased by several types of contextual factors-in particular, framing of outcomes. A popular explanation for outcome framing effects is based on presumed affective reactions that contribute to accepting sure gains and avoiding sure losses. Other theories propose that selective weighting of information about gains and losses contributes to framing bias. Prior research on framing bias has focused on preferences rather than on decisions in which choices can be classified as advantageous (correct) or disadvantageous (incorrect) by a normative criterion. The current study used a novel hypothetical risky decision making task offering choices between a sure option and a gamble option. The gamble was advantageous or disadvantageous on different trials based on the normative criterion of expected value. Results showed risk avoidance with a gain frame and risk seeking with a loss frame, comparable to findings when choices involve preferences. We also examined the impact of working memory loads of either non-affective stimuli, most likely to interfere with acquisition of choice information, or affective stimuli, which might influence affective processes contributing to framing. The results were that non-affective working memory load produced the greatest framing magnitude, while affective load produced changes in framing magnitude across trials that varied by valence. In addition, only the non-affective load decreased advantageous choices and reduced the accuracy of answers to knowledge probe questions about the choices. The findings are consistent with the notion that framing effects may arise from cognitive non-engagement with the task, rather than arising by way of affective processes. Affective loads had a limited influence on framing and no reliable impact on choice accuracy or choice knowledge, suggesting that the affective loads influenced the weighting of choice information."
