The increase of the enzyme activity was attributed mostly to the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 rather than cyclooxygenase-1 as judged by the inhibitory effect of NS398, Western blotting, and Northern blotting. In this system we attempted to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of the cyclooxygenase-2 gene. As examined by the luciferase assay, two positive regulatory regions (−186 to −131 and −512 to −385 base pairs) were found in the 5′-flanking promoter region of the mouse cyclooxygenase-2 gene in the TNFα-stimulated cells. The former included putative NF-IL6 (C/EBPβ) and AP2 elements, and the latter contained the NFκB motif. A DNA probe including the NF-IL6 and AP2 sites gave positive bands upon electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the nuclear extracts of MC3T3-E1 cells. The bands were supershifted by the addition of anti-NF-IL6 antibody but not by anti-AP2 antibody. A probe including the NFκB site also gave positive bands, which were supershifted by anti-NFκB p50 and p65 antibodies. Furthermore, when the motif of NF-IL6 or NFκB or both was subjected to point mutation, the luciferase activity was markedly reduced. These data suggested a potential role of both NF-IL6 and NFκB in the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by TNFα.

The enzyme is a bifunctional enzyme, and has the cyclooxygenase activity (from arachidonic acid to PGG2) and the hydroperoxidase activity (from PGG2 to PGH2). Two isozymes referred to as cyclooxygenase-1 and −2 in this paper are found in the mammalian tissues(1.Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Curr. Opin. Invest.

Cyclooxygenase-1 is generally considered as a constitutive enzyme, while cyclooxygenase-2 is rapidly and transiently induced by various cytokines, hormones, and tumor promoters(1.Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 1994; 3: 1-11Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 2.Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In view of such an inducible nature the cyclooxygenase-2 has recently been a subject of active molecular biological investigations. Promoter regions of the cyclooxygenase-2 genes of mouse(3.Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Regardless of the animal species these promoter regions contained a canonical TATA box and various putative transcriptional regulatory elements such as CRE, NF-IL6 (C/EBPβ), AP2, SP1, NFκB, and GATA box. Among these elements, CRE (6.Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 7.Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D.

An osteogenic MC3T3-E1 cell line was established from newborn mouse calvaria. The cells differentiate into osteoblasts, and show calcification in vitro(9.Kodama H. Amagai Y. Sudo H. Kasai S.

Yamamoto S. Kumegawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16.Pilbeam C.C. Kawaguchi H. Hakeda Y. Voznesensky O. Alander C.B. Raisz L.G. J. Biol.

In the present work, we attempted to find out the transcriptional regulatory factors involved in the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by TNFα in the MC3T3-E1 cells. The materials used in this work were purchased as follows: [1-14C]arachidonic acid (2.1 GBq/mmol) and 35S-labeled anti-rabbit IgG whole antibody (74 TBq/mmol) from Amersham International (Bucks, United Kingdom); Immobilon-P transfer membrane from Millipore (Bedford, MA); [γ-32P]ATP (220 TBq/mmol) from DuPont NEN; fetal bovine serum and newborn bovine serum from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA); penicillin G and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride from Sigma; α-modified Eagle's minimum essential medium (α-MEM), recombinant mouse TNFα, and lipofectAMINE from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD); ISOGEN from Nippon Gene (Tokyo, Japan); EMBL3 mouse genomic library from Clonetech (Palo Alto, CA); Pica Gene luciferase assay system from Toyo Ink (Tokyo, Japan); poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden); anti-AP2, anti-C/EBPβ (NF-IL6), and anti-NFκB p50 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-NFκB p65 antibody from Serotec (Oxford, United Kingdom); and purified NFκB p50 protein from Promega (Madison, WI). MC3T3-E1 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. H. Kodama of Ohu University, luciferase plasmid pXP-1 by Dr. T. Sakai of Kyoto Prefectural University, and expression vectors containing the genes of NF-IL6 and NFκB p50 by Dr. S. Akira of Osaka University. NS398 was donated by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. (Saitama, Japan). MC3T3-E1 cells (7.5 × 105 cells/dish) were plated in 150-mm plastic dishes with 30 ml of α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin G as described previously(11.Yokota K. Kusaka M. Oshima T. Yamamoto S. Kurihara N. Yoshino T. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15410-15415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dishes were placed in a humidified 7% CO2, 93% air incubator at 37°C. The cells were subcultured every 3 days. MC3T3-E1 cells (6 × 104 cells/dish) were plated in 35-mm dishes with 2 ml of α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent cultures were usually obtained on the 4th day. Then, the medium was changed to α-MEM supplemented with 2% newborn bovine serum, and TNFα was added. At indicated time intervals, the culture medium was removed and subjected to radioimmunoassay for PGE2(11.Yokota K. Kusaka M. Oshima T. Yamamoto S. Kurihara N. Yoshino T. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15410-15415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells (9 × 105 cells/dish) were plated in 150-mm dishes with 30 ml of α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and treated with TNFα. The cells were scraped from the dishes at various time intervals, suspended in 300 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM tryptophan, and sonicated twice each for 3 s at 20 kHz. The sonicates were incubated with 10 μM [1-14C]arachidonic acid (50,000 cpm in 5 μl of ethanol) for 2 min at 24°C in a 100-μl assay mixture containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 μM hematin, and 5 mM tryptophan. The reaction products were separated by TLC(15.Takahashi Y. Taketani Y. Endo T. Yamamoto S. Kumegawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and detected by a BAS2000 imaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(17.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. A polyclonal anti-cyclooxygenase-2 was prepared with a peptide corresponding amino acids 579-594 of murine enzyme, and provided by Dr. Yoko Hayashi of this laboratory. The sonicates of MC3T3-E1 cells were subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% SDS (10 μg of protein/lane). The protein bands were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane, which was incubated with the polyclonal antibody against cyclooxygenase-2 and then with 35S-labeled anti-rabbit IgG whole antibody as the second antibody. Radioactivity of the immunocomplex was quantified by a BAS2000 imaging analyzer. Total RNA was extracted from MC3T3-E1 cells using ISOGEN (a mixture of guanidium isothiocyanate and phenol) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Northern blotting was performed as described previously(15.Takahashi Y. Taketani Y. Endo T. Yamamoto S. Kumegawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18.Endo T. Ogushi F. Sone S. Ogura T. Taketani Y. Hayashi Y. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The relative radioactivity of each band was estimated using a BAS2000. We screened a mouse genomic library constructed in EMBL3 to clone the 5′-flanking region of the mouse cyclooxygenase-2 gene by the method as described previously for 12-lipoxygenase(19.Arakawa T. Oshima T. Kishimoto K. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12188-12191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragments of mouse cyclooxygenase-2 promoter regions of various lengths or their point mutants were prepared from the clone by polymerase chain reaction, and were inserted into the plasmid pXP-1 as described previously for 12-lipoxygenase(20.Arakawa T. Nakamura M. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells (1.4 × 105 cells/dish) were cultured for 2 days in 60-mm dishes with 5 ml of α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection the subconfluent cells were treated with plasmid DNA (2.3 μg) containing cyclooxygenase-2 promoter and luciferase reporter gene, standard plasmid DNA (1.2 μg) containing the β-galactosidase gene, and 9.2 μl of lipofectAMINE in 2.3 ml of serum-free α-MEM for 4 h at 37°C according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was changed to 5 ml of α-MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the transfected cells were further incubated for 3 days. Then the cells were stimulated by 20 ng/ml TNFα in the presence of α-MEM supplemented with 2% newborn bovine serum. After 12 h the cells were scraped from the dishes, and the luciferase activity was measured by a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold, Germany) using a Pica Gene luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activities which were assayed as described previously (20.Arakawa T. Nakamura M. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells (9 × 105 cells/dish) were plated in 10 150-mm dishes with 30 ml of α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and stimulated with various concentrations of TNFα. After 1 h the cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously(20.Arakawa T. Nakamura M. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We synthesized the five oligonucleotides as shown in Fig. 4. The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to the corresponding oligonucleotides as described by Berger and Kimmel(21.Berger S.L. Kimmel A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the double-stranded oligonucleotides were purified electrophoretically on 15% polyacrylamide gel, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, and used as probes. The binding of the probes (10,000 cpm, about 10 fmol) to the nuclear extracts (2.3 μg protein) was performed in a 20-μl mixture containing 5 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 15 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 12% glycerol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. For the supershift experiment, each antibody was added to the mixture. The mixture was incubated at 25°C for 30 min, and applied to 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels at a constant 150 V for 2 h. Distribution of the radioactivity on the dried gel was analyzed by a BAS2000 imaging analyzer. When MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated with various concentrations of TNFα for 12 h, there was a dose-dependent increase in the amount of PGE2 released into the medium (Fig. 1A). After the addition of 20 ng/ml TNFα, the PGE2 release increased with a lag time of about 1 h, and reached a maximum at 9 h (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, TNFα increased the cyclooxygenase activity dose and time dependently, and the enzyme activity continued to increase for 24 h to a specific activity of 0.8-2 nmol/2 min/mg of protein. NS398, a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2(22.Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), inhibited the enzyme activity almost completely at 15 μM concentration (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that most of the increased enzyme activity was attributable to cyclooxygenase-2 rather than cyclooxygenase-1. To confirm this finding we carried out Western blotting with an antibody specific for cyclooxygenase-2 (Fig. 2A). Without TNFα the cyclooxygenase-2 protein was undetectable, and the addition of 20 ng/ml TNFα increased the enzyme amount time dependently up to 9 h. There was a slight but reproducible decrease around 12 h, followed by an increase again. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2B, the change in mRNA level was followed by Northern blot analysis. The addition of TNFα brought about a biphasic increase in the cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA. First, there was a rapid 10-fold increase reaching a maximum at 2 h, followed by a decrease at 3 h. Then, the mRNA increased again at 6-12 h. However, after the first transient peak the presence of 15 μM NS398 reduced the second peak. The cyclooxygenase-1 mRNA was not detectable under these experimental conditions. These results presented in Figure 1:, Figure 2: demonstrated a rapid and marked induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by TNFα. The second peak of the cyclooxygenase-2 may be attributable to the enzyme which was induced by accumulating PGE2 produced by the cyclooxygenase-2 at the first peak. As illustrated at the top of Fig. 3, about 600 bp of the 5′-flanking region of mouse cyclooxygenase-2 gene contained various putative response elements; MEF-2 (a muscle-specific DNA binding protein, −490 to −481 bp), NFκB (−401 to −393 bp), SP1 (−239 to −234 bp), AP2 (−150 to −142 bp), NF-IL6 (−138 to −130 bp), CRE (−56 to −51 bp), and TATA box (−30 to −25 bp). The sequences of 5′-GGGATTCCC-3' (−401 to −393 bp) and 5′-TTGCGCAAC-3' (−138 to −130 bp) were identified as NFκB and NF-IL6 elements on the basis of their concensus sequences of 5′-GGGA(A/C)TN(T/C)CC-3' and 5′-T(T/G)NNGNAA(T/G)-3', respectively, as described previously (23.Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). For deletion analysis of the promoter region, we constructed luciferase vectors of various lengths covering the region from −621 to −41 bp (Fig. 3). Each vector was transfected to MC3T3-E1 cells by the lipofection method, and the luciferase activity of the cell lysate was measured at 12 h after the addition of 20 ng/ml TNFα. The addition of TNFα markedly stimulated the luciferase activity (closed column versus slashed column). The luciferase activity decreased when two regions (−512 to −385 bp, −186 to −131 bp) were deleted, and these regions were presumed to have positive response elements. We noted NFκB consensus element (−401 to −393 bp), AP2 element (−150 to −142 bp), and NF-IL6 element (−138 to −130 bp). For further identification of these positive regulatory elements, we prepared five double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (g1, g2, gA, gB, and gC). As shown in Fig. 4, g1 (−409 to −385 bp) contained NFκB and their vicinity. gA (−155 to −121 bp) contained AP2 and NF-IL6. g2, gB, and gC were mutant probes for NFκB, AP2, and NF-IL6, respectively. We carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the nuclear extracts of MC3T3-E1 cells preincubated with TNFα for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 5, when g1 probe was incubated with the nuclear extracts, a broad band of complex α was observed with increasing density depending on the amount of TNFα (lanes 3-6). The complex α was hardly detectable before the addition of TNFα (lane 2). Considering the subunit structure of NFκB (p50 and p65), the g1 probe was incubated with the purified NFκB p50, and a band appeared at the position of complex α (lane 7). The complex α was supershifted to complex β by the addition of anti-p50 antibody (lane 10), and was supershifted to complex γby the addition of anti-p65 antibody (lane 11). The binding was not observed using the probe g2 with a mutation in NFκB motif (lanes 13 and 14). When gA probe was incubated with the nuclear extracts, three complexes (a, b, and c) appeared with increasing density depending on the amount of TNFα (Fig. 6, lanes 3-6). These complexes were supershifted to bands d, f, and g by the addition of antibody against NF-IL6 (lane 8). The binding was scarcely observed by the use of the probe gC with a mutation in NF-IL6 (lanes 15-19). Moreover, the complex a was supershifted to complex e by the addition of anti-NFκB p50 (lane 9). The bands a, b, and c were not supershifted by anti-AP2 antibody (lane 7), and the binding profile was not affected by the use of the probe gB with a mutation in AP2 (lanes 10-14). These data suggested that NFκB and NF-IL6 were increased by the addition of TNFα in a dose-dependent manner. For mutation analysis of the promoter region, we constructed luciferase vectors including mouse cyclooxygenase-2 promoter region (−512 to +123 bp) with site-specific mutations (Fig. 7). Each vector was transfected to MC3T3-E1 cells, and the luciferase activity was measured as described above. As shown in Fig. 7, the luciferase activity decreased by 63% in a mutant of NFκB, 82% in a mutant of NF-IL6, and only 19% in a mutant of AP2 site. By mutation of both NFκB and NF-IL6, the luciferase activity was lost to the level of pXP1. These data suggested that both NFκB and NF-IL6 in combination acted as transcription factors for the induction of cyclooxygenase-2. Furthermore, expression vectors containing the genes of NF-IL6 and NFκB p50, respectively, were cotransfected to MC3T3-E1 cells together with a luciferase plasmid containing the promoter region of cyclooxygenase-2 (−512 to +123 bp). The luciferase activity increased depending on the amount of NF-IL6 cDNA (data not shown). A similar experiment using the expression vector for NFκB p50 has so far been unsuccessful. It was reported previously that TNFα increased the PGE2 production and the cyclooxygenase activity in mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1(24.Sato K. Kasono K. Fujii Y. Kawakami M. Tsushima T. Shizume K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25.Rapuano B.E. Bockman R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26.Yanaga F. Abe M. Koga T. Hirata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5114-5121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed these findings (Fig. 1), and demonstrated that the increased enzyme activity was attributed mostly to the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 according to the inhibitory effect of NS398, Western blotting, and Northern blotting (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). The mechanism of the biphasic increase of cyclooxygenase-2 protein and mRNA (Fig. 2) may be discussed as follows. First, TNFα activates phospholipase A2 (as reported in (27.Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar)) and induces cyclooxygenase-2, resulting in an increased production of PGE2. Then, the produced PGE2 binds to a PGE receptor, and increases the cyclooxygenase-2 protein and mRNA again. Previously we reported the cyclooxygenase-2 induction by various PGs, including PGE2 which was a major arachidonate metabolite in this cell line(15.Takahashi Y. Taketani Y. Endo T. Yamamoto S. Kumegawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since the addition of TNFα brought about such a typical and prominent induction of cyclooxygenase-2 in MC3T3-E1 cells, we attempted to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of the cyclooxygenase-2 gene in this system. The luciferase assay (Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Figure 5:, Figure 6:) revealed two positive regulatory elements on the 5′-flanking region of mouse cyclooxygenase-2 gene: NFκB motif (5′-GGGATTCCC-3') located at nucleotides −401 to −393 bp and NF-IL6 motif (also referred to as C/EBPβ, 5′-TTGCGCAAC-3') at −138 to −130 bp. NF-IL6 was originally identified as a nuclear factor binding to the IL-1 response element of the human IL-6 gene(28.Isshiki H. Akira S. Tanabe O. Nakajima T. Shimamoto T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2757-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). By cDNA cloning NF-IL6 was found to be a member of the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors(29.Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies suggested a regulatory role of NF-IL6 for the genes encoding many acute-phase proteins and cytokines(30.Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 25-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The NF-IL6 motif on the rat cyclooxygenase-2 gene (5′-TTATGCAAT-3' located at −140 to −132 bp) was previously reported to contribute to the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by forskolin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone in granulosa cells(4.Sirois J. Levy L.Ø. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12199-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21931-21938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that the cyclooxygenase-2 induction was mediated by an activating transcription factor/CRE element (5′-CGTCACGTG-3' at −56 to −48 bp) on the mouse cyclooxygenase-2 gene promoter (7.Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or by CRE element (5′-TTCGTCA-3' at −59 to −53) in the human cyclooxygenase-2 gene(6.Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, we could not demonstrate the involvement of the CRE motif in the TNFα-dependent cyclooxygenase-2 induction in MC3T3-E1 cells. The AP2 element (5′-CCGCTGCGG-3', −150 to −142 bp) close to the NF-IL6 was shown to be inactive (Fig. 3, Fig. 6, and Fig. 7). NFκB was originally found as a binding protein to immunoglobulin κ light-chain enhancer(31.Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar), and it is now considered as a ubiquitous transcription factor. It is constitutively present in the nuclei of B cells, certain T cell lines and monocytes, and has the structure of either homodimer or heterodimer(32.Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 33.Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Schmitz M.L. Henkel T.

Sci. 1992; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The heterodimer of p50 and p65 subunits has higher affinity to the NFκB site than the homodimer of either p50 or p65(36.Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). As examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 5), the nuclear extracts of MC3T3-E1 cells gave the complex α which is associated presumably with p50-p50 homodimer and p50-p65 heterodimer. The double mutant of NFκB and NF-IL6 showed a lower luciferase activity than a single mutant of either NFκB or NF-IL6 (Fig. 7). Interaction of both NFκB and NF-IL6 was suggested by a finding that band a was supershifted to band e by anti-NFκB p50 antibody in electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a probe including the NF-IL6 motif (lane 9 in Fig. 6). Individual binding sites for NF-IL6 and NFκB are present in the promoter of the IL-6 gene, and the cooperation of these two factors plays an important role in transcription of IL-6(37.Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). A similar activation was reported for the IL-8 promoter, which also contains both NF-IL6 and NFκB binding sites(37.Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The NFκB p50 and NF-IL6 proteins directly interact in vitro, and the Rel homology domain and leucine-zipper motif, respectively, are important for this interaction (38.LeClair K.P. Blanar M.A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). TNFα enhanced the promoter activity of the cyclooxygenase-2 gene of MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 3), and increased the amounts of NFκB and NF-IL6 bound to the DNA probes including the corresponding cis-elements (Figure 5:, Figure 6:). The results were in parallel with the marked induction of cyclooxygenase-2 in the TNFα-stimulated cells (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). It was shown that TNFα activated an endosomal acidic sphingomyelinase through the 55-kDa TNF receptor and then the produced ceramide triggered the activation of NFκB(27.Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). TNFα also induced NF-IL6 in the mouse lung, liver, and kidney(30.Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 25-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). By analogy we presume that TNFα triggers the activation or induction of both NFκB and NF-IL6, resulting in the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 in MC3T3-E1 cells. We should note that there are NFκB and NF-IL6 sites in human (5.Kosaka T. Miyata A. Ihara H. Hara S. Sugimoto T. Takeda O. Takahashi E. Tanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and rat (4.Sirois J. Levy L.Ø. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol.

Members of the BimC subfamily of kinesin-related MT-motor proteins are believed to be essential for the formation and functioning of a normal bipolar spindle. Here we report that KRP130, a homotetrameric BimC-related kinesin purified from Drosophila melanogaster embryos, has an unusual ultrastructure. It consists of four kinesin-related polypeptides assembled into a bipolar aggregate with motor domains at opposite ends, analogous to a miniature myosin filament. Such a bipolar 'minifilament' could crosslink spindle MTs and slide them relative to one another. We do not know of any other MT motors that have a bipolar structure."

https://openalex.org/W2047575901,"The phosphorylation and localization of the membrane-linking protein moesin was analyzed during early activation of platelets with thrombin. Activated platelets elaborate filopodia and spread to assume flat pancake-like shapes, and moesin is localized in filopodia and cell body. In resting platelets, approximately 25% of moesin molecules are phosphorylated as shown by metabolic labeling with 32P(i) and by isoelectric focusing. Within seconds after exposure to thrombin, phosphorylation increases, reaching a maximum of 35% labeled molecules by 1 min, followed by a decrease to a new basal level within 5 min. This modification affects a single residue, Thr558, which is located within or close to a binding site for F-actin. Rapid shifts (0-100%) in the number of phosphorylated molecules are observed in the presence of inhibitors of serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases. Inhibitors affecting tyrosine phosphorylation also modulate phosphorylation at this site suggesting that the enzymes involved in the modification of Thr558 are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Platelets respond to both extremes of modification by forming extremely long filopodia and the absence of spreading on glass. Completely phosphorylated moesin is concentrated together with F-actin in the center of the cell. The rapid modification of moesin at or near its actin-binding domain suggests a model for regulated membrane-cytoskeleton interaction during cell activation."

Using this system, we show that α-, β′-, and ∊-COP interact directly and that γ-COP interacts with ξ-COP. A partial complex comprising α-, β′-, and ∊-COP, obtained after coatomer disassembly, can bind to membranes in vitro. This binding is, at least in part, mediated by interactions with cytoplasmic KKXX motifs of proteins normally retained in or retrieved to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Coat proteins (COPs) ( (1)The abbreviations used are: COPscoat proteinsERendoplasmic reticulumARFADP-ribosylation factorIPimmunoprecipitationGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albumin.) play a key role in regulating intracellular membrane traffic (Kreis and Pepperkok, 1994). They are required to form transport vesicles, and they also prevent uncoupled membrane fusion (Orci et al., 1993; Ostermann et al., 1993; Barlowe et al., 1994; Elazar et al., 1994). Three types of coated vesicle have so far been described: clathrin-coated vesicles bud from the plasma membrane and from the trans-Golgi network (Pearse and Robinson, 1990), non-clathrin-coated or COP I-coated vesicles are involved in transport between the intermediate compartment and the Golgi complex (Pepperkok et al., 1993) and in intra-Golgi transport (Ostermann et al., 1993), and COP II-coated vesicles participate in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport (Barlowe et al., 1994). coat proteins endoplasmic reticulum ADP-ribosylation factor immunoprecipitation guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin. The non-clathrin (COP I) coat consists of two major components, coatomer and ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) (Serafini et al., 1991; Waters et al., 1991). Coatomer and ARF exist separately in the cytosol but co-assemble to form coats. Coatomer is a complex of seven subunits, termed α-(∼160 kDa), β-(107 kDa), β′-(102 kDa), γ-(∼100 kDa), δ-(∼60 kDa), ∊-(36 kDa), and ξ-(20 kDa) COP (Waters et al., 1991). ARF is a small GTPase that is required for membrane association of coatomer (Donaldson et al., 1992a; Palmer et al., 1993). ARF binding to membranes is dependent upon the activity of a brefeldin A-sensitive, membrane-associated, guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which converts ARF-GDP to ARF-GTP (Donaldson et al., 1992b; Helms and Rothman, 1992). ARF-GTP on the membranes stimulates coatomer binding, coat formation, and probably vesicle budding. At a later stage, GTP hydrolysis by ARF triggers coat disassembly and allows vesicle fusion to occur (Tanigawa et al., 1993). Coatomer and ARF were originally identified using an in vitro intra-Golgi transport assay (Malhotra et al., 1989; Serafini et al., 1991). Good evidence now exists that these components function in transport to the Golgi complex in vivo. For example, mutations in the γ-COP homologue of yeast coatomer, Sec21p, block transport between the ER and the Golgi complex (Hosobuchi et al., 1992). Microinjection of antibodies to β-COP into living mammalian cells blocks transport from the ER to the Golgi complex (Pepperkok et al., 1993). Interestingly, microinjected antibodies against β-COP also inhibit brefeldin A (BFA)-induced retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the ER, ( (2)J. Scheel, R. Pepperkok, M. Lowe, G. Griffiths and T. E. Kreis, manuscript in preparation.) suggesting a role for coatomer in retrograde traffic. Indeed, it has recently been shown that coatomer is essential in yeast for retrieval from the Golgi complex of ER proteins bearing the KKXX signal (Letourneur et al., 1994). The molecular weights of the coatomer subunits are similar to those of clathrin and the adaptors (Malhotra et al., 1989); β-COP has weak homology to β-adaptin (Duden et al., 1991), and more recently the cloning of ξ-COP has shown that it has homology to the AP17 and AP20 adaptor subunits (Kuge et al., 1993), suggesting there may be similarities in structure and function between the two types of coat. In addition, the binding of coatomer and the AP1 adaptor to the Golgi complex and trans-Golgi network, respectively, is sensitive to brefeldin A (Robinson and Kreis, 1992) and requires ARF (Stamnes and Rothman, 1993), suggesting that similar mechanisms of coat assembly may occur. Interestingly, β′-COP contains five WD40 repeats, which are also found in trimeric G protein β-subunits (Stenbeck et al., 1993; Harrison-Lavoie et al., 1993). The recent finding that yeast α-COP also contains WD-40 repeats in its N terminus (Letourneur et al., 1994) suggests that these repeats might mediate interaction between the β′- and α-COP subunits. We wanted to look at the intersubunit associations between individual COPs within the coatomer complex. To study interactions between the COPs, an in vitro system was established to reversibly disassemble and reassemble coatomer. Using this system, we show that α-, β′-, and ∊-COP interact directly and that ξ-COP interacts with γ-COP. We also demonstrate that a partial complex comprising α-, β′-, and ∊-COP, obtained after coatomer disassembly, can bind to membranes in vitro. In addition, using anti-peptide antibodies we show that the N- and C-terminal domains of β-COP are buried within the coatomer complex. Antibodies against synthetic peptides of β-COP have been prepared and affinity purified as described (Pepperkok et al., 1993). Anti-β′-COP antibodies were raised in rabbits against the peptide KTDINLDEDILDD. A murine monoclonal antibody against β-COP (M3A5) was also used (Allan and Kreis, 1986). An anti-peptide antibody raised against γ-COP was kindly donated by Drs. C. Harter and F. T. Wieland. Fab fragments were prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer using papain immobilized on beads (Pierce). Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells, ATCC CCL 81) were maintained as described earlier (Kreis and Lodish, 1986). Cells were incubated in labeling medium (prepared by mixing 9 parts of methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium with 1 part of normal minimal essential medium) containing 30 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Pro-Mix, Amersham) for 18-22 h at 37°C. To prepare cytosol, cells were washed three times with ice-cold homogenization buffer, and the dishes were drained of excess liquid. Homogenization buffer was either HB-N (0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA) if the cytosol was to be used immediately for immunoprecipitation or HB-P (0.1 M KPO4, pH 6.7, 5 mM MgCl2) if the cytosol was to be used in experiments requiring dialysis. Cells from four 10-cm dishes were scraped into 1 ml of homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM 1:10 phenanthroline, 2 μM pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and passed 20 times through a 25-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and the resulting high speed supernatant was used for experiments. Cytosol, which had been dialyzed or frozen/thawed was first centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4°C to remove aggregates. Triton X-100 was added from a 10% stock solution to give 0.5% final concentration. 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia, 50% slurry in immunoprecipitation buffer) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C on a rotating wheel. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and specific antibodies were added to the supernatant. After incubation overnight at 4°C, 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added. For immunoprecipitations with Fab fragments, 20 μg of goat anti-rabbit IgG was also added here. For immunoprecipitations with M3A5, 20 μg of sheep anti-mouse IgG was added. After 2 h at 4°C, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer and then once with 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline. IP buffer was IP-N (0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) for immunoprecipitations from cytosols prepared using HB-N, IP-P (0.1 M KPO4, pH 6.7, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) for cytosols prepared using HB-P and cytosols dialyzed against RB-P, or IP-T (0.5 M Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) for cytosols dialyzed against DB-T. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer and were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Coatomer was immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled Vero cytosol with 2 μg of anti-EAGE polyclonal antibodies as described above. After the final wash in immunoprecipitation buffer, the beads were resuspended in 1 ml of IP-N buffer, DB-TT (0.5 M Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100), DB-MT (0.25 M MgCl2, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100), or DB-NT (1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C on a rotating wheel. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 1 ml of the same buffer and then once with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins were eluted from the beads in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Coatomer was immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled Vero cytosol with 5 μg of anti-EAGE antibodies as described above. After the final wash in IP-N buffer, the beads were resuspended in 500 μl of DB-TB (DB-TT minus Triton, with 0.25 mg/ml BSA), DB-MB (DB-MT minus Triton, with 0.25 mg/ml BSA), or DB-NB (DB-NT minus Triton, with 0.25 mg/ml BSA) and incubated for 4 h at 4°C on a rotating wheel. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge to remove aggregates. 200 μl of the supernatant was injected onto a 24-ml Superose 6 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), equilibrated in DB-T, DB-M, or DB-N (DB-TT, DB-MT, DB-NT, respectively, minus Triton), and fractionated with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. After 10 ml of elution, 0.5-ml fractions were collected, 2.5 μl of BSA (10 mg/ml) was added as a carrier, and proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (see Duden and Franke, 1988) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The remaining 300 μl of the supernatant was loaded on top of a 5-30% sucrose gradient (11.3 ml) poured in DB-T, DB-P, or DB-N. After centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 18 h in a Kontron TST 41.14 rotor, 600-μl fractions were collected from the top, BSA was added as a carrier, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Typically between 200 μl to 1 ml of cytosol (2-4 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 1 liter of DB-T for 24 h at 4°C in micro-colloidon bags (Sartorius). Samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation, sucrose gradient centrifugation, or were redialyzed against 1 liter of RB-P (0.1 M KPO4, pH 6.7, 5 mM MgCl2) for another 24 h at 4°C. Samples (300 μl) were loaded on top of 5-30% sucrose gradients (11.3 ml) made in either DB-T (for Tris-dialyzed cytosol) or RB-P (for non-dialyzed cytosol), made in HB-P and cytosol dialyzed against RB-P, and centrifuged in a Kontron TST 41.14 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 18 h at 4°C. Fractions (600 μl) were collected from the top, and proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To prepare rat liver cytosol, 30 g of frozen rat liver was thawed at 4°C, minced in 60 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2) containing protease inhibitors, and homogenized with a Polytron using three 30-s bursts on setting 4, with a 2-min sedimentation and cooling period on ice between bursts. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min in a Haereus 18.50 rotor. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min in a Kontron TST 41.14 rotor. The resulting supernatant was collected and centrifuged for a further 120 min at 200,000 × g in the TST 41.14 rotor. The 200,000 × g supernatant (rat liver cytosol) was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Golgi-enriched membranes were prepared from rat liver using the method of Malhotra et al.(1989). Rat liver cytosol (200 μl, 20 mg/ml) was fractionated on a 24-ml Superose 6 column, equilibrated in 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 25 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, using a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and fractions containing proteins of 10-80 kDa (containing ARF but not coatomer) were pooled (elution volume of 17.0-19.5 ml). This pool (0.8 mg/ml protein) was stored at −80°C. To measure binding of 35coatomer, incubations (120 μl) were carried out for 10 min at 37°C in the presence of 0.2 M sucrose, 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 25 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and an ATP regenerating system (50 μM ATP, 2 mM creatine phosphate, 12.5 units/ml creatine kinase). 14 μg of Golgi-enriched membranes and 160 μg of non-dialyzed (3.3 mg/ml) or dialyzed (3.0 mg/ml) rat liver cytosol were added as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were layered on top of 200 μl of 15% sucrose (in 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 25 mM KCl) and centrifuged at 4°C in a microcentrifuge for 30 min at 15,000 rpm. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 15 μl of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and β-COP was detected by immunoblotting with M3A5 at 1:1,000 dilution. To measure binding of S-labeled disassembled COPs, coatomer was immunoprecipitated from 35S-labeled Vero cytosol with 5 μg of EAGE antibody as described above. The immunoprecipitate was incubated in 250 μl of DB-TB for 4 h at 4°C, and the beads were removed by centrifugation. The eluted COPs were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge to remove aggregates and added to the binding assay. Incubations (200 μl) were carried out for 10 min in the presence of 50 μl of disassembled COPs, 0.2 M sucrose, 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 25 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, an ATP regenerating system (as above), and 40 μg of the 10-80-kDa fraction of rat liver cytosol. 14 μg of Golgi-enriched membranes were added as indicated in the figure legends. For the WBP1 competition experiment, 25 μl of disassembled COPs were preincubated for 2 h at 4°C in the presence of 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 25 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, an ATP regenerating system (as above), 40 μg of the 10-80-kDa fraction of rat liver cytosol, and either 30 μg of GST-WBP1 or GST-WBP1-SS (Cosson and Letourneur, 1994) as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. 14-μg membranes were then added, and incubations were carried out for 10 min at 37°C. Samples were layered onto sucrose cushions and processed as described above. Proteins were detected by fluorography. To analyze proteins in the supernatant, they were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and processed for SDS-PAGE. To immunoprecipitate membrane-bound proteins, the membrane pellet was solubilized in IP-N for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 rpm. Proteins were then immunoprecipitated as described above. The GST-WBP1 and GST-WBP1-SS fusion proteins were purified from bacteria as described previously (Cosson and Letourneur, 1994). Incubations (240 μl) were carried out for 2 h at 4°C in the presence of 40 μl of disassembled COPs (prepared as for the membrane binding experiments), 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 90 mM KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 30 μg of GST-WBP1 or GST-WBP1-SS immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and processed for SDS-PAGE. The beads were washed 4 × 1 ml with 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 90 mM KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 and then 1 × 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Reduced proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (1970). For the analysis of 35S-labeled proteins, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, washed in water for 30 min, incubated in 1 M salicylate for 20 min, and vacuum dried. Fluorographs were taken on x-ray film (X-Omat-AR films, Eastman Kodak) at −70°C. Quantitation of radiolabeled proteins was performed with a ScanJet Plus (Hewlett Packard) using the Deskscan and NIH Image programs on the Macintosh. For immunoblotting, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were then incubated with primary antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cappel). Peroxidase labeling was detected by ECL (Amersham). To study disassembly of coatomer in vitro, the complex was immunoprecipitated from 35S-labeled Vero cytosol and then subjected to various treatments. Immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the EAGE epitope of β-COP under native conditions gave a pattern characteristic of coatomer with bands corresponding to α-, β/β′-, γ-, δ-, ∊-, and ξ-COP (Fig. 1A). If the immune complex was incubated in buffer containing 0.5 M Tris, 0.25 M MgCl2, or 1 M NaCl, only one major band at ∼100 kDa remained bound to the beads (Fig. 1A). Note that with 0.5 M Tris there was a small amount of δ-COP remaining bound to the beads. This was reproducible between experiments and represented 15% of the amount of δ-COP present before incubation in 0.5 M Tris. Quantitation of the other COPs revealed that in each case less than 2% of the amount originally bound was present after treatment with Tris. Since β-, β′-, and γ-COP migrate at ∼100 kDa on a normal SDS-polyacrylamide gel, immunoblotting was performed to identify which of these COPs remained on the beads. After incubation with 0.5 M Tris, 0.25 M MgCl2, or 1 M NaCl, only β-COP was present (Fig. 1B). β-COP therefore dissociates from the other coatomer subunits when incubated in high salt concentrations. The finding that ∼15% of δ-COP remained on the beads in 0.5 M Tris while the other subunits were completely dissociated suggests that β-COP can interact directly with δ-COP. We next analyzed whether the other COPs had dissociated from each other after incubation in high salt concentrations. Immunoprecipitated coatomer was incubated with 0.5 M Tris, 0.25 M MgCl2, or 1 M NaCl; the beads were removed by centrifugation, and the COPs in the supernatant were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration chromatography. After incubation with 0.5 M Tris or 1 M NaCl, α-COP comigrated with ∊-COP and a 100-kDa COP on a sucrose gradient (Fig. 2A). The three proteins peaked at fraction 6. There was another peak of 100-kDa COPs at fraction 4, and δ-COP peaked at fraction 3. In buffer containing 0.5 M Tris, ξ-COP comigrated with a 100-kDa COP at fraction 4 and had a second peak at fraction 2, whereas in buffer containing 1 M NaCl there was only one peak at fraction 2. 0.25 M MgCl2 gave identical results to 1 M NaCl (data not shown). After gel filtration chromatography in buffer containing 0.5 M Tris, there was a peak of 100-kDa COPs at fractions 10 and 11 (Fig. 2B). δ-COP peaked at fraction 12 while ξ-COP migrated as two species, one at fractions 10 and 11 and one at fraction 16. There were faint bands for α- and ∊-COP between fractions 3 and 8. Both proteins were much less abundant than the other COPs, however, suggesting that they are degraded or stick to the column under these conditions. Gel filtration in buffer containing 1 M NaCl (or 0.25 M MgCl2, not shown) gave similar results to 0.5 M Tris except that ξ-COP migrated as one peak at fraction 17, and strong bands were present for α-COP, ∊-COP, and a 100-kDa COP at fractions 6 and 7. To identify the 100-kDa COPs, proteins were separated on a 7% gel and immunoblotted with antibodies to γ- and β′-COP; note that β-COP remained attached to the beads (see Figure 1:, Figure 2:B). γ-COP migrated as one species peaking at fraction 4 on a sucrose gradient (Fig. 2C) and fraction 12 on a gel filtration column (Fig. 2D). β′-COP migrated as two species. The major species was at fraction 6 on sucrose gradient and fraction 7 on a gel filtration column, and the other (minor) species was at fraction 4 on a sucrose gradient and fraction 11 on a gel filtration column (Fig. 2, C and D). β′-COP is therefore the 100-kDa subunit that cofractionates with α- and ∊-COP. It was also possible to co-immunoprecipitate α-, β′-, and ∊-COP in buffer containing 0.5 M Tris using an antibody to β′-COP, confirming that these three proteins interact (data not shown). Thus, incubation with 0.5 M Tris dissociates the coatomer into smaller units, consisting of an α-, β′-, and ∊-COP complex, a γ- and ξ-COP complex, monomeric β-COP and δ-COP, and some monomeric ξ-COP and β′-COP. Incubation with 0.25 M MgCl2 or 1 M NaCl dissociates coatomer into an α-, β′-, and ∊-COP complex and monomeric β-COP, γ-COP, δ-COP, ξ-COP, and some monomeric β′-COP. These results show that α-, β′-, and ∊-COP interact directly in the coatomer complex and that γ-COP interacts with ξ-COP. We used an in vitro assay (Donaldson et al., 1991, 1992a; Palmer et al., 1993) to study the membrane binding activity of disassembled coatomer subunits. Coatomer that had been immunoprecipitated from 35S-labeled Vero cytosol was incubated with 0.5 M Tris, and the beads were removed by centrifugation. The eluted COPs were then incubated with Golgi-enriched membranes in the presence of a 10-80-kDa fraction of rat liver cytosol (as a source of ARF). α-COP, ∊-COP, and a 100-kDa COP bound to the membranes (Fig. 3A). Note that δ-COP and ξ-COP did not bind. The 100-kDa COP was identified as β′-COP since an antibody raised against this subunit co-immunoprecipitated α-, β′-, and ∊-COP from the membranes. This also showed that these three proteins were in a complex when bound to the membranes. In addition, separation of proteins on a 7% gel to resolve β′- from γ-COP (β-COP was not present in the assay since it is not eluted from the antibody with 0.5 M Tris) showed that only β′-COP, and not γ-COP, was present in the membrane pellet (Fig. 3B). A partial coatomer complex comprising α-, β′-, and ∊-COP can therefore bind to membranes. Interestingly, membrane binding of the trimer, unlike the intact coatomer, was insensitive to GTPγS (not shown). It has recently been demonstrated that a partial complex of coatomer, comprising α-, β′-, and ∊-COP, which formed in cell extracts in 0.3 M NaCl, could bind to the KKXX retrieval motif of resident ER proteins in vitro (Cosson and Letourneur, 1994). This suggested to us that membrane binding of the trimer may be through interactions with the KKXX motifs of certain membrane proteins. To investigate this further, the radiolabeled, disassembled COPs were incubated with beads containing either GST-WBP1, which has a functional KKXX ER retrieval signal, or GST-WBP1-SS, which does not have a functional retrieval signal (Cosson and Letourneur, 1994). As shown in Fig. 3C, the trimer comprising α-, β′-, ∊-COP bound specifically to the GST-WBP1 beads and not to the GST-WBP1-SS beads, in line with previous results (Cosson and Letourneur, 1994). This also demonstrated that the trimer was not apparently denatured since it could specifically interact with the WBP1 KKXX motif. To study whether membrane binding of the trimer involved KKXX binding, a competition experiment was performed. The disassembled COPs were preincubated with either WBP1 or WBP1-SS, and then the membrane binding was performed. Trimer binding to membranes was reduced to 40% of the control amount when the COPs were incubated with GST-WBP1 (Fig. 3D). The WBP1-SS mutant had no effect on binding. This suggests that binding of the α-, β′-, and ∊-COP partial complex to membranes is, at least in part, via interactions with KKXX motifs of certain membrane proteins. Vero cytosol was dialyzed against buffer containing 0.5 M Tris to disassemble coatomer and then redialyzed against a more physiological buffer to see if reassembly occurred. Coatomer could be immunoprecipitated from non-dialyzed cytosol under native conditions with the anti-peptide antibodies EAGE (β-COP) or KTDI (β′-COP) (Fig. 4A). After dialysis against buffer containing 0.5 M Tris, only β- or β′-COP was precipitated, showing that both of these proteins had completely dissociated from the other COPs. The complete dissociation of β′-COP was unexpected, since we had already demonstrated that it binds α-COP and ∊-COP after disassembly of immunoprecipitated coatomer with 0.5 M Tris (see Fig. 2). This difference was not due to the longer time used for dialysis since incubation of immunoprecipitated coatomer in buffer containing 0.5 M Tris for 24 h gave the same result as shorter incubations (data not shown). Perhaps coatomer bound to the EAGE antibody adopts a different conformation to coatomer in cytosol, and this limits the extent of disassembly. Alternatively, cytosolic factors might be required for complete disassembly of coatomer. If cytosol that had first been dialyzed against 0.5 M Tris was then redialyzed against 0.1 M potassium phosphate (RB-P), both EAGE and KTDI again immunoprecipitated the entire coatomer complex showing that reassembly had occurred. Densitometry confirmed that the stoichiometry of subunits was the same for native and for reassembled coatomer (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Sucrose gradient centrifugation confirmed that disassembly with 0.5 M Tris is reversible. β-COP peaked at fraction 11 in non-dialyzed Vero cytosol, giving a sedimentation coefficient of ∼13 S as previously reported (Duden et al., 1991) (Fig. 4B). After dialysis against buffer containing 0.5 M Tris, β-COP shifted to a lower density and peaked at fraction 5, corresponding to a sedimentation coefficient of ∼6 S. Redialysis against 0.1 M potassium phosphate resulted in a β-COP distribution similar to that of non-dialyzed cytosol, showing that it had fully integrated into reassembled coatomer. Identical results were obtained with rat liver cytosol (data not shown). The in vitro membrane binding assay was used to study the membrane binding activity of reassembled coatomer and to compare it to that of native coatomer. Incubation of non-dialyzed rat liver cytosol with Golgi-enriched membranes resulted in membrane binding of coatomer (Fig. 5). This binding was increased 2 to 3 fold by GTPγS in agreement with previously reported results (Donaldson et al., 1991; Palmer et al., 1993). Rat liver cytosol, which had previously been dialyzed against buffer containing 0.5 M Tris and then 0.1 M potassium phosphate to disassemble and reassemble coatomer, gave a similar amount of binding to untreated cytosol. This was enhanced 2-fold by GTPγS. Thus, reassembled coatomer is competent to bind membranes in a GTP-dependent manner, as described for native coatomer. To identify domains of β-COP required for interactions with the other coatomer subunits, we took advantage of the large number of anti-peptide antibodies raised against β-COP and the finding that coatomer can be disassembled using relatively mild conditions. 35S-Labeled Vero cytosol was subjected to immunoprecipitation under native conditions with eight antibodies raised against β-COP (see Fig. 7) (we initially used 24 different antibodies, but 16 of these did not immunoprecipitate under native conditions or in buffer containing 0.5 M Tris (data not shown)). Of the eight antibodies, seven failed to precipitate any specific proteins and only one, EAGE, immunoprecipitated coatomer (Fig. 6A). If the cytosol was first dialyzed against buffer containing 0.5 M Tris, all eight of the antibodies now immunoprecipitated β-COP. Note that, as expected, only β-COP and none of the other COPs was precipitated under these conditions since β-COP is dissociated from the other COPs. Similar results were obtained when the experiment was repeated with Fab fragments (Fig. 6B). The other coatomer subunits therefore appear to mask the epitopes of seven of these antibodies, and it is only when they are removed that the epitopes can be recognized. These epitopes may form interaction sites for binding to the other coatomer subunits.Figure 6:Immunoprecipitation with eight anti-β-COP antibodies. Non-dialyzed (top portion) or 0.5 M Tris (DB-T)-dialyzed (bottom portion) 35S-labeled Vero cytosol was immunoprecipitated with different anti-β-COP antibodies as indicated. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% gel and detected by fluorography. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with whole IgGs (A) or Fab fragments in conjunction with a linker antibody (B). Molecular mass standards are in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have developed an in vitro system that allows reversible disassembly of coatomer. Under defined conditions α-, β′-, and ∊-COP and γ- and ξ-COP remain associated, showing that these subunits interact directly in the coatomer complex. In addition, β-COP can interact directly with δ-COP since a significant fraction of the δ-COP present in immunoprecipitated coatomer remains associated with β-COP after treatment with 0.5 M Tris, while the other subunits are completely released. This interaction is weaker than that between γ- and ξ-COP. The interaction between γ- and ξ-COP is, in turn, weaker than that between α-, β′-, and ∊-COP since γ- and ξ-COP dissociate in buffer containing 1 M NaCl or 0.25 M MgCl2, while the α-, β′-, and ∊-COP complex does not. The α-, β′-, and ∊-COP partial complex could bind to Golgi-enriched membranes in vitro. This binding was insensitive to nucleotides and appeared to be due, at least in part, to interactions with membrane KKXX motifs. The competition with WBP1 was specific since the mutant containing two serines instead of lysines did not have any effect in the assay. However, the binding could only be reduced by about 60% by preincubation with the GST-WBP1 fusion protein. This could be explained by there being some KKXX motifs on the membranes with a much higher affinity for the trimer than for GST-WBP1. Alternatively, the trimer may interact with other membrane proteins (non-KKXX containing), or it may be sticky such that 40% can still bind to membranes even in the presence of an excess of WBP1. All three possibilities may have physiological relevance. One could imagine, for example, that coatomer first binds to membranes in an ARF-dependent manner, and during or after this step it undergoes a conformational change. The α-, β′-, and ∊-COP subunits could then become available for interaction with cargo molecules bearing, for example, the KKXX motif or other as yet undiscovered signals; alternatively, this trimer might perhaps also interact with the actual lipids of the membrane. An important function of the other subunits within the coatomer complex may be the regulation of these activities. Further experiments are clearly necessary to increase our understanding of the mechanistic details involved in coatomer binding to membranes. We initially chose to use 0.5 M Tris and 0.25 M MgCl2 to dissociate coatomer because it had already been demonstrated that these conditions disassemble the coat of clathrin-coated vesicles (Woodward and Roth, 1978; Keen et al., 1979). The separate clathrin and adaptor complexes that comprise the clathrin coat do not disassemble under these conditions, however, and disassembly requires high concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride (Ahle and Ungewickell, 1989; Scarmato and Kirchhausen, 1990; Prasad and Keen, 1991). The dissociated components of the clathrin (heavy and light chains) and adaptor (two 100-kDa, 50-kDa, and 19-kDa subunits) complexes reassemble when dialyzed out of non-denaturing conditions (Scarmato and Kirchhausen, 1990; Prasad and Keen, 1991). Similarly, we show here biochemically that dissociated coatomer subunits reassociate to form coatomer when they are dialyzed out of high salt concentrations. Thus, each set of coat protein complexes has the capacity to spontaneously reassemble in vitro. Reassembly of coatomer in vitro appears to be efficient since 100% of dissociated β-COP is integrated into coatomer during reassembly. Reassembled coatomer also appears to fold in a similar way to native coatomer, since both complexes have the same migration on a sucrose gradient. The fact that the subunit stoichiometry is the same for reassembled and native coatomer also supports the notion that the dissociated COPs refold properly during assembly. This is further supported by the finding that reassembled coatomer recruits onto membranes. Coatomer exists as a stable complex in vivo (Hara-Kuge et al., 1994), but it must assemble soon after synthesis of its individual subunits. Whether this assembly occurs spontaneously is not clear at the moment. It is, for example, conceivable that chaperonins might assist in folding of the COPs. Anti-peptide antibodies have been raised against epitopes throughout the sequence of β-COP (Pepperkok et al., 1993). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that only one of these antibodies, EAGE, could recognize the native coatomer complex. These data are in good agreement with results obtained from microinjection of antibodies into living cells (Pepperkok et al., 1993). Of the antibodies injected, only 110-12 and EAGE could bind to β-COP in vivo. The 110-12 and EAGE epitopes are in the central region of β-COP, while the other epitopes are either in the N-terminal 120 amino acids (KDLQ) or the C-terminal half (E1, M3A5, KESE, D1, KLVE, LGDK) of the protein (see Fig. 7). These parts of β-COP are therefore buried within the coatomer complex, rendering them inaccessible to antibodies. Only one of the ten anti-peptide antibodies raised against the N-terminal half of β-COP worked by immunoprecipitation in 0.5 M Tris (data not shown). This may be due to low antibody affinities or the possibility that the N-terminal half of β-COP has a complex folding. For much of the N terminus of β-COP, it is still therefore unclear whether it is sequestered in the coatomer complex, as is the C-terminal half of the protein. In addition, it is not known if those epitopes that are buried in the complex are contact sites for binding to other COPs, since antibody access can be sterically inhibited by COPs that may not bind to the epitope. Further experiments using mutated proteins should help identify contact sites between β-COP and other coatomer subunits. The structure of the coatomer complex, the spatial arrangement of its subunits, and the functions of the individual COPs are poorly understood at the moment. The ability to disassemble and reassemble the coatomer complex should help to further elucidate the structure of coatomer and clarify the roles of the individual COPs within the complex.

https://openalex.org/W2079563236,"The DNA binding and ATPase activities of RecF protein are modulated by RecR protein. Stoichiometric amounts of RecF protein bind to double-stranded (ds) DNA (about 1 RecF monomer/4-6 base pairs) in the presence of adenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (ATPγS), forming a homogeneous protein coating on the DNA. Little or no cooperativity is evident in the binding process. In the presence of ATPγ, RecF binding to dsDNA is much weaker, and no RecF protein coating forms. Instead, small numbers of RecF protomers are interspersed randomly along the DNA. RecR protein does not bind appreciably to the dsDNA under these same conditions. However, a protein coating, similar to that which was observed with RecF protein alone in the presence of ATPS, was produced when both RecF and RecR proteins were incubated with dsDNA in the presence of ATP. An interaction between RecF and RecR enables both proteins to bind tightly to the dsDNA in an approximately 1:1 molar ratio. We also report a weak ATP hydrolytic activity of RecF which is stimulated by RecR. The DNA binding and ATPase activities of RecF protein are modulated by RecR protein. Stoichiometric amounts of RecF protein bind to double-stranded (ds) DNA (about 1 RecF monomer/4-6 base pairs) in the presence of adenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (ATPγS), forming a homogeneous protein coating on the DNA.

An interaction between RecF and RecR enables both proteins to bind tightly to the dsDNA in an approximately 1:1 molar ratio. We also report a weak ATP hydrolytic activity of RecF which is stimulated by RecR. The products of the recF, recO, and recR genes are believed to act at a similar and early stage of recombinational DNA repair and homologous recombination in Escherichia coli(1.Smith G.R. Genome. 1989; 31: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 2.Sawitzke J.A. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1992; 130: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Wang T.C. Chang H.Y. Hung J.L. Mutat.

These three genes show remarkably similar mutant phenotypes. The frequency of recombination between plasmids is reduced 100-fold by a mutation in any one of these genes in a wild-type background(6.Cohen A. Laban A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1983; 189: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7.Kolodner R. Fishel R.A. Howard M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In excision repair deficient cells (uvrA), mutations in recF, recO, or recR produce a major deficiency in the repair of daughter strand gaps(9.Tseng Y.C. Hung J.L. Wang T.C. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, the SOS response to DNA damage is significantly delayed in cells harboring a mutation in any of the three (10.Hegde S. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Madiraju M.V. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11.Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). How the RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins are able to act on such a wide variety of DNA substrates is not known. Biochemical characterization of the individual proteins is beginning to offer some clues. The RecF protein has been shown to bind ssDNA ( (1)The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAbpbase pair(s)FII DNAnicked and circular form of dsDNAATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside.) (12.Griffin IV, T.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6291-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13.Madiraju M.V.V.S. Clark A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6295-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and, in the presence of ATP or ATPγS, dsDNA(14.Madiraju M.V. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The RecO protein also binds to both ssDNA and dsDNA, and promotes renaturation of complementary ssDNA molecules in the absence of ATP(15.Luisi D.C. Kolodner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). E. coli RecR does not bind to ssDNA(16.Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and no information regarding its dsDNA binding properties has been published, although the Bacillus subtilis RecR has been shown to bind both ssDNA and dsDNA(17.Alonso J.C. Stiege A.C. Dobrinski B. Lurz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1424-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the biochemical studies involving the combination of these proteins have focused on their interaction with the RecA protein in the presence of single-stranded DNA. The RecO and RecR proteins in combination have been shown to help the RecA protein overcome the inhibitory effects of the single-stranded DNA binding protein on joint molecule formation in vitro(4.Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16.Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the RecF protein inhibits most of the activities of the RecA protein in vitro, including ssDNA binding, joint molecule formation(13.Madiraju M.V.V.S. Clark A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6295-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and LexA cleavage. ( (2)B. L. Webb, unpublished results.) Although the primary structure of each of the three proteins displays a nucleotide-binding fold, ATP hydrolysis has not been reported for any of them. single stranded DNA double-stranded DNA base pair(s) nicked and circular form of dsDNA adenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside. Since these three proteins are thought to act at the same step of recombination and have been proposed to function as a complex(3.Wang T.C. Chang H.Y. Hung J.L. Mutat. Res. 1993; 294: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), they may manifest a physical interaction with each other under the right conditions. Recently, the RecO and RecR proteins were shown to interact in the absence of any DNA or nucleotide cofactor(16.Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we show that the RecF and RecR proteins interact in the presence of ATP and dsDNA. This interaction enables both to bind tightly to the DNA. We also provide evidence for a weak ATP hydrolytic activity of RecF protein. E. coli RecF and RecR proteins were purified as described below. The concentration of RecF and RecR proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (18.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. RecA protein was purified as described elsewhere (19.Cox M.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4676-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of ∊280= 0.59 A280 mg-1 ml(20.Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8039-8044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases and Vent DNA polymerase were purchased from New England BioLabs. Bovine serum albumin and ATP were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the University of Wisconsin Biochemistry Department Synthesis Facility. Plasmids pET21a and pET21d were purchased from Novagen. The Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was from Bachem. Phosphocellulose P11 was from Whatman Ltd. PBE94, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and Sepharose 4B resins were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Ultragel AcA54 gel filtration resin was from Sepracor. Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose type 100 resin was from Sigma. [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. Mahcery-Nagel polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography (polyethyleneimine/UV254) sheets were purchased from Brinkmann. φX174 RF II DNA was purchased from New England BioLabs. Bacteriophage M13mp8.1037 is derived from M13mp8(21.Messing J. Vieira J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar), having a 1037-bp insertion (EcoRV-EcoRV fragment from the E. coli galT gene) in the SmaI site(22.Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10164-10171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Supercoiled circular duplex DNA from bacteriophage M13mp8.1037 was prepared using a method described previously(23.Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar, 24.Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar, 25.Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8276-8282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete digestion of supercoiled M13mp8.1037 by MscI resulted in linear duplex DNA. The concentration of DNA stock solutions was determined by absorbance at 260 nm, using 50 mg ml-1A260-1 as the conversion factor. DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of total nucleotides. The recF and recR genes were individually isolated from the E. coli genome (26.Guyer M.S. Reed R.R. Steitz J.A. Low K.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1981; 1: 135-140Crossref Google Scholar) (strain MG1655, a gift from George Weinstock) by polymerase chain reaction using a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler. This was accomplished by designing DNA primers which were complementary to the 5′ DNA sequence and to the 3′ DNA sequence of each gene. For the recF gene, the 5′ DNA primer corresponded to bases 6-21 of the published DNA sequence(27.Blanar M.A. Sandler S.J. Armengod M.E. Ream L.W. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4622-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with the sequence 5′-CCTCATGAG added to the 5′ end to provide a BspHI restriction site. This primer, designed to facilitate cloning, changed the second codon of the gene from TCC to AGC, though both encode for serine. The 3′ DNA primer corresponded to bases 1057-1074, with the sequence 5′-CCCAAGCTT added to the 5′ end to provide a HindIII restriction site. For the recR gene, the 5′ DNA primer corresponded to bases 584-598 of the published sequence(28.Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6781-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with the sequence 5′-CGTGATCCATATGCAG added to the 5′ end to provide a NdeI site. This primer was designed to change the second codon of recR from CAA to the more preferred codon for glutamine in E. coli, CAG(29.Reznikoff R. Gold L. Maximizing Gene Expression. Butterworth Publishers, Stoneham, MA1986: 227Google Scholar). The 3′ DNA primer corresponded to bases 1164-1183, with the sequence 5′-CCCAAGC added to the 5′ end to create a HindIII restriction site. These primers were used to amplify DNA fragments of the appropriate size by the polymerase chain reaction. The recF gene fragment was digested with BspHI and HindIII and then ligated to the cloning vector pET21d (Novagen). This plasmid containing the recF gene was designated pBLW20. The recR gene fragment was digested with NdeI and HindIII and subsequently ligated to pET21a (Novagen). This plasmid containing the recR gene was designated pBLW22. The integrity of the entire recF and recR genes in these constructs was verified by direct sequencing (Sequenase kit and protocol, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For the purpose of overexpressing RecF protein, pBLW20 was transformed into the E. coli strain K38/pGP1-2(30.Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). For overexpressing RecR protein, pBLW22 was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(31.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar, 32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.9Google Scholar). A 30-liter culture of E. coli strain, K38/pGP1-2, with the plasmid pBLW20 was grown with aeration in a New Brunswick MPPF 30 liter fermentor at 30°C in Luria broth (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 40 μg/ml kanamycin) to an OD650 = 0.5. Expression of RecF protein was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and by raising the temperature of the medium to 42°C for 30 min. The culture was then incubated at 25°C for 5 h, after which the cells were collected by centrifugation. Outgrowth of the cells at 25°C rather than 37°C greatly increased the amount of soluble RecF protein. The cell pellet (480 g) was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 80% cation (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose) at 1.65 ml/g of wet cells, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. RecF protein was purified as previously described(12.Griffin IV, T.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6291-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13.Madiraju M.V.V.S. Clark A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6295-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The fractions from the phosphocellulose column containing RecF protein were pooled and treated with ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation. The precipitate was harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman JA21 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in a volume of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4°C), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) such that the conductivity was equal to that of buffer A + 100 mM NaCl. This solution was then loaded onto a PBE94 column (35-ml bed volume, 1.0 cm × 44 cm) that had been previously equilibrated in buffer A + 100 mM NaCl. The column was then washed with two bed volumes of buffer A + 100 mM NaCl and developed with a 160-ml linear gradient of buffer A with from 100 to 600 mM NaCl. Peak fractions (around 200 mM NaCl) were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A + 1 M NaCl. This solution was loaded onto a Ultragel AcA54 gel filtration column (125-ml bed volume, 1.5 cm × 71 cm) equilibrated in buffer A + 1 M NaCl. The high salt concentration was required to minimize interaction between RecF protein and the column resin. The pooled peak fractions were then dialyzed against buffer A + 60% glycerol [w/v] + 100 mM NaCl, and stored at −70°C. The final yield of RecF protein from 100 g cells was 3.6 mg. The RecF proteins was at least 95% pure as estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and contained no detectable endo- or exonuclease activities. A 30-liter culture of E. coli strain, BL21(DE3), with the plasmid pBLW22 was grown with aeration in a New Brunswick MPPF 30-liter fermentor at 37°C in Luria broth (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) to an OD650 = 1.5. RecR protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. The culture was then incubated at 37°C for 9 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation (200 × g), resuspended in lysis buffer at 2 ml/g of wet cells, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. RecR protein was purified as described elsewhere(4.Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The final yield of RecR protein from 26 g of cells was 7.6 mg. The RecR protein was estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) to be at least 95% pure and was free of detectable endo- or exonuclease activities. All reactions were carried out in a standard reaction buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. DNA and nucleotide cofactors were added as indicated. The pH at 37°C after addition of all reaction components was 7.01. Proteins were incubated with 3 μM DNA (FII or linear dsDNA as indicated) at 37°C in the standard reaction buffer for 10 min. Samples were prepared directly from reaction mixtures, without cross-linking, by the following adsorption procedure. (a) A carbon film was evaporated onto a set of freshly cleaved mica disks at an angle of 90°C. Carbon-coated disks were used after aging for at least 2 weeks and were usable for at least 1 year. The carbon film was made as thin as possible while retaining the capacity to resist breakage during subsequent steps. The carbon film was floated off the mica by sliding the disk through a clean air-water interface at an angle of 45°C, and pieces of the film were picked up from below on 400 mesh copper electron microscope grids. After drying, the grids were stored in a desiccator. (b) Immediately before use, the carbon-filmed grids were briefly dipped sequentially into three separate beakers containing CHCl3 and dried under a heat lamp. Carbon films were then “activated” by floating the grids on a 50-μl drop of 0.002% Alcian blue in 0.03% acetic acid, for 5-10 min followed by a wash on a 1-ml drop of water for 5-10 min. The excess water was removed, and grids were dried under a heat lamp. The above activation and washing steps were not necessary for visualization of the DNA-protein complexes discussed in this report, but were used to increase the yield of any unreacted DNA adsorbed to the carbon film and thus give a more realistic view of the contents of a reaction mixture. (c) The grids were floated on a 10-μl drop of the reaction mixture (immediately after the reaction incubation) for 30 s followed by floating on three 1-ml drops of washing solution containing 15% glycerol, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM MgCl2 for 1 s, 5 min, and 10 min, respectively. (d) The grids were then briefly touched to a 50-μl drop of staining solution containing 10% glycerol and 5% uranyl acetate, and then floated on a second drop of the same staining solution for 40 s. The grids were then washed by touching briefly to four drops of 10% glycerol in water, and the remaining liquid was withdrawn with a capillary pipette. The grids were dried under a heat lamp for 2 min. Finally, the sample was rotary shadowed with platinum in a vacuum evaporator. The uranyl acetate solution mentioned above was made up every 3 months, initially filtered through a 0.22-μm Millipore membrane and stored in a dark bottle at room temperature. Before each use, the solution was spun for 1 min in a microcentrifuge, and only the top part of the supernatant was used. The Alcian blue solution was made up each day by dilution of a stock solution containing 0.2% Alcian blue in 3% acetic acid. Photography and measurements of the protein-DNA complexes were carried out as described previously(33.Littlewood R.K. Inman R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1691-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Copies of the electron micrographs discussed in this publication are available for viewing or downloading using a World-Wide Web Client at the URL: http://phage.bocklabs.wisc.edu/. RecA (2 μM) was incubated with φX174 RF II DNA (6 μM) and 3 mM ATP in 25 mM MES-NaOH (56% cation, pH 6.27), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 2% glycerol (v/v) with an ATP-regenerating system (5 units ml-1 creatine phosphokinase, 6 mM phosphocreatine), 10 min at 37°C. After this incubation period, ATPγS was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and the reaction was incubated an additional 10 min. To neutralize the pH of this reaction mixture prior to spreading, it was diluted with an equal volume of a solution containing the same components described above except the buffer was 25 mM Tris acetate (40% cation, pH 8.4) and the RecA and DNA were not present. Nicked, circular φX174 dsDNA (FII; 10 μM) was preincubated with either RecF protein (2 μM), RecR protein (2 μM), or their corresponding storage buffers (as a control), 10 min at 37°C in a 60-μl reaction mixture containing the standard reaction buffer. Nucleotide cofactors were included as indicated. A 15-μl aliquot was then removed (for a zero time point with respect to digestion by the restriction endonuclease). To the remaining reaction mixture was added NEBuffer no. 4 and BspHI (New England Biolabs) to final concentrations of 1× and 0.1 units/μl, respectively (a total addition of 6 μl). Aliquots (25 μl) of the restriction digestion reactions were removed at the indicated time points and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of gel loading buffer (30% glycerol, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 30 mM EDTA, 5% SDS). Samples were then electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose gel. An agarose gel assay patterned after a published procedure (14.Madiraju M.V. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was used to detect complexes between linear dsDNA and RecF and RecR proteins. Proteins as indicated were incubated in 35-μl reaction mixtures containing 10 μM linear dsDNA in the standard reaction buffer at 37°C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation period 5 μl of a gel loading buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), 50% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) were added. Samples were then loaded onto an 0.8% agarose gel and electrophoresed at 2.5 V/cm with recirculation of the running buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), 4 mM sodium acetate, and 0.1 mM EDTA). The DNA was then detected by ethidium bromide staining. A Sepharose 4B gel filtration column (3.85-ml bed volume, 0.7 cm × 10 cm) was used to isolate RecF-RecR-DNA complexes. Proteins and linear dsDNA at the indicated concentrations were incubated in 60-μl reaction mixtures in the standard reaction buffer at 37°C for 10 min. This reaction mixture was loaded onto a Sepharose 4B column that had been previously equilibrated with buffer A + 100 mM NaCl + 1 mM ATP and chromatographed, 2 ml/h at room temperature. Fractions (115 μl) were collected and analyzed for DNA and protein content. A portion of each fraction was run on a 0.8% agarose gel to determine the elution volume of the DNA, which was found be in the column void volume (2.7 ml). A portion of each fraction was also run on a 15% polyacrylamide minigel to visualize the elution profile of the RecF and RecR proteins. RecF protein and RecR protein bound to the DNA were found in the void volume, while that which was unbound was found to elute at 5.78 ml and 4.62 ml, respectively. After each experiment the column was washed with 2 M NaCl to wash off any protein which had adsorbed to the column resin. The concentration of DNA in the void volume of individual experiments was determined by running a sample of the peak fraction alongside a DNA titration of known concentration on the same 0.8% agarose gel to generate a standard curve. The photographic negative of the ethidium bromide-stained gel was scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI and the DNA bands quantitated using ImageQuant NT software. The amount of RecF protein and RecR protein bound to the DNA was determined by running a sample of the same fraction on a 15% polyacrylamide minigel, including a RecF protein titration and a RecR protein titration to generate standard curves. After silver staining the gel, the protein bands were quantitated in the same fashion as the DNA. The polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates were first developed in water overnight, a step recommended by the manufacturer to clean the plates prior to use. The plates were then dried and stored at 4°C. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing the standard reaction buffer, [α-32P]ATP, various concentrations of cold ATP, and DNA as indicated, were preincubated at 37°C for 5 min. The reaction was started by the addition of RecF protein. RecR protein was added at this time as well, as indicated. At various time points, aliquots (1 μl) of the reaction were spotted to prewashed TLC plates to quench the hydrolysis reaction. The TLC plates were developed in 1 M formic acid, 0.5 M LiCl. The plates were dried and exposed to storage phosphor screens (Molecular Dynamics). The exposed phosphor screens were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (model 425E). The radioactivity in the ATP and ADP spots were quantified using ImageQuant NT software, and the percent ATP hydrolyzed was calculated and plotted versus time. The percent ATP hydrolyzed per min was calculated by a linear least squares fit. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated using the expression: Rate of ATP hydrolysis=((percnt ATP hydrolyzedmin)×[ATP]0)/100 where [ATP]0 is the concentration of ATP at time 0 (before the addition of RecF protein). An interaction between the RecF and RecR proteins was inferred from the effects of RecR on RecF activities in vitro as described below, and from the detection of complexes containing both proteins. Binding of RecF protein to dsDNA was characterized by electron microscopy, endonuclease protection, gel retardation, and gel filtration. A standard assay for ATP hydrolysis was adapted to detect a low level ATPase activity of RecF protein. RecF has been shown to retard linear dsDNA on an agarose gel in the presence of ATP and its nonhydrolyzable analog, ATPγS (14.Madiraju M.V. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy was used to visualize the RecF-dsDNA complex formed in the presence of ATPγS. Unbound nicked circular dsDNA is shown in Fig. 2A for reference. Addition of RecF protein, at concentrations equivalent to 1 monomer/1.25 base pairs of DNA resulted in a complete coating of the DNA with RecF protein (Fig. 2, B and C). These RecF-DNA complexes were sufficiently stable to survive the spreading procedure without cross-linking. DNA topology did not affect RecF binding, as similar results were seen with supercoiled and linear double-stranded DNA (data not shown). Further experiments showed that a full coating of the dsDNA was obtained at RecF concentrations corresponding to 1 RecF monomer/5 bp and greater. As described in more detail below, this coating of the DNA is not observed when ATP replaces ATPγS. We also measured the contour length of RecF-bound DNA to determine if binding resulted in a measurable extension of the DNA. Also shown in Fig. 2 is a comparison of RecF-coated dsDNA and the same dsDNA substrate bound by RecA protein in the presence of ATPγS. RecA is known to form a right-handed helical protein filament on linear dsDNA under these conditions(34.Stasiak A. Egelman E.H. Experientia. 1994; 50: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We found that RecA lengthened the dsDNA by 62% relative to protein-free DNA under these spreading conditions (Fig. 2, D versus A), somewhat more than the 53% extension reported previously(35.Stasiak A. Di Capua E. Nature. 1982; 299: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 36.Dunn K. Chrysogelos S. Griffith J. Cell. 1982; 28: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RecF (Fig. 2, B and C) had a more modest effect, increasing the contour length of dsDNA by 9% in the presence of ATPγS. RecF complexes formed on dsDNA at concentrations of RecF insufficient to coat the DNA suggested that the binding was largely noncooperative. Two intermediate points in the titration, at RecF to base pair ratios of 1:20 and 1:7, along with protein-free and fully coated DNA, are shown in Fig. 3, with increasing protein concentration from left to right. By counting the number of RecF dots per DNA molecule on a representative number of DNA molecules within each sample, we were able to demonstrate that the average number of dots bound per DNA does increase with increasing RecF concentration (data not shown). Also evident is that the dots accumulated in an apparently random fashion over the entire length of the DNA molecule, rather than as a single tract of protein, as would be expected if the binding were as cooperative as that observed with RecA protein(36.Dunn K. Chrysogelos S. Griffith J. Cell. 1982; 28: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with titrations using gel retardation (data not shown) in which increasing RecF concentrations kept the entire DNA band relatively compact while decreasing its mobility in incremental steps. Using the digestion of linear dsDNA by the restriction endonuclease BspHI as a measure of protein binding, we found that RecF protein (at 1 monomer/5 bp) completely protected the DNA from digestion in the presence of ATPS (Fig. 4). A partial protection was observed when ATP replaced ATPγS. RecR protein alone (at 1 monomer/5 bp) afforded no protection to the DNA. However, including the RecR protein in the reaction with RecF protein led to complete protection of the DNA in the presence of ATP (Fig. 4). The partial protection of the DNA afforded by RecF protein alone and ATP reflected an incomplete but apparently stable interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2070823973,"We have isolated cDNA clones encoding the rat and human forms of a novel protein kinase, termed TESK1 (testis-specific protein kinase 1). Sequence analysis indicates that rat TESK1 contains 628 amino acid residues, composed of an N-terminal protein kinase consensus sequence followed by a C-terminal proline-rich region. Human TESK1 contains 626 amino acids, sharing 92% amino acid identity with its rat counterpart. The protein kinase domain of TESK1 is structurally similar to those of LIMK (LIM motif-containing protein kinase)-1 and LIMK2, with 49-50% sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis of the protein kinase domains revealed that TESK1 is most closely related to a LIMK subfamily. Chromosomal localization of human TESK1 gene was assigned to 9p13. Anti-TESK1 antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide of TESK1 recognized two polypeptides of 68 and 80 kDa in cell lysates of COS cells transfected with human TESK1 cDNA expression plasmid. TESK1 protein expressed in COS cells exhibited serine/threonine kinase activity, when myelin basic protein was used as a substrate. Northern blot analysis revealed that TESK1 mRNA was specifically expressed in rat and mouse testicular germ cells. The TESK1 mRNA in the testis was detectable only after the 18th day of postnatal development of mice and was mainly expressed in the round spermatids.

Protein kinases play a pivotal role in intracellular signal transduction systems involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, and other activities. There are two broad categories of protein kinases; one is tyrosine kinase with substrate specificity toward the tyrosine residue, and the other is the serine/threonine kinase with specificity toward serine and threonine residues, although the latter includes proteins with dual specificity toward both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. The protein kinases in each category are further divided into many subfamilies, based on sequence similarities of the kinase catalytic domain and the extracatalytic domain(1.Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 249-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 2.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 3.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). An increasing number of protein kinase genes have been isolated by cDNA cloning. Some of the newly identified protein kinases contain catalytic and extracatalytic domains not related to any known members of the protein kinase family. It is assumed that these unclassified protein kinases have specific functions in signal transduction pathways not previously established and are regulated in a different manner. For example, a JAK family of protein kinases was identified as a solitary class of protein kinases structurally not related to other known kinases, and later specific roles in the signal transduction system linked to receptors for interferons and other cytokines were discovered (4.Ihle J.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In view of the central role of protein kinases in diverse cell activities, further searches for a novel class of protein kinases and specification of their roles in various systems are important to better understand signal-transduction mechanisms. We recently identified a novel class of protein kinases, termed LIM kinases (LIMKs), ( (1)The abbreviations used are: LIMKLIM motif-containing protein kinaseMBPmyelin basic proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineTESK1testis-specific protein kinase 1kbkilobase(s)SH3Src homology 3.) composed of LIMK1 and LIMK2(5.Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1605-1612PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ohashi K. Toshima J. Tajinda K. Nakamura T. Mizuno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both of these two closely related kinases contain characteristic structural features, consisting of the N-terminal two LIM motifs and the C-terminal unusual protein kinase domain. The LIM motif, a structural motif composed of two adjacent zinc fingers separated by a 2-amino acid linker(7.Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), may be involved in the regulation of the kinase activity of LIMKs. The C-terminal kinase domains of LIMKs contain a consensus sequence of protein kinases, but are unique in that they have an unusual sequence motif (DLNSHN) in the kinase catalytic loop in subdomain VIB and a highly basic insert sequence between subdomain VII and VIII(5.Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1605-1612PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ohashi K. Toshima J. Tajinda K. Nakamura T. Mizuno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the functional roles of LIMK family kinases have yet to be determined, the unique structural features of these kinases suggest specific roles for these kinases in previously uncharacterized signaling pathways. LIM motif-containing protein kinase myelin basic protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline testis-specific protein kinase 1 kilobase(s) Src homology 3. During the search for LIMK-related protein kinases, we isolated the cDNA encoding a novel protein kinase. As the mRNA transcripts of this kinase are expressed almost exclusively in the testis of rat and mouse, we termed this novel protein kinase TESK1 for “testis-specific protein kinase.” The protein kinase domain of TESK1 is most closely related to those of LIMKs, but the overall domain structure is totally different. In contrast to LIMKs, TESK1 has no N-terminal extension including LIM motifs but does have an N-terminal protein kinase domain, followed by a long C-terminal extension rich in proline residues. Here we report the molecular cloning and sequences of rat and human TESK1 cDNAs and the serine/threonine-specific kinase activity of TESK1 protein transiently expressed in COS cells. The predominant expression of the TESK1 mRNA in testicular germ cells and developmental changes in the expression of TESK1 mRNA in mouse testis indicate an important role of TESK1 at and after the meiotic phase of spermatogenesis. Using as a probe the 32P-labeled 1.9-kb PstI fragment of human LIMK1 cDNA(5.Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1605-1612PubMed Google Scholar), a random-primed rat brain cDNA library in λZAPII (approximately 3 × 105 independent phage plaques) was screened, under conditions of low stringency hybridization, as described previously(8.Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 699-705PubMed Google Scholar). One of the 16 positive clones, rLK-6, was isolated and subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), and the cDNA insert was subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. To obtain full-length cDNA clones, an oligo(dT)-primed rat testis cDNA library in λZAPII (3 × 105 independent plaques) was screened with the 32P-labeled rLK-6 cDNA probe. Of the 24 positive clones detected, 7 positive ones were isolated, subcloned into pBluescript, and subjected to the nucleotide sequence analysis. To isolate the cDNAs encoding human TESK1, an oligo(dT)-primed λZAPII cDNA library of human HepG2 hepatoma cells (5 × 105 phage plaques) was screened, using the rLK-6 probe. Two positive clones (hLK3-1 and hLK3-2) were isolated and used for sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method(9.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar), using Taq polymerase and a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit with a model 370A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Overlapping cDNA fragments were obtained by sequential exonuclease III digestion (10.Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) or by priming with sequence-specific oligonucleotides. Dissociated germ cells were prepared from rat and mouse testes, as described previously(11.Stern L. Gold B. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 1983; 28: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12.Kashiwabara S. Arai Y. Kodaira K. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, the decapsulated testicles were incubated in bicarbonate-buffered RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 mg/ml collagenase at 34°C for 15 min with constant agitation. The dispersed seminiferous tubules were washed three times with RPMI 1640 and treated with 0.25 mg/ml trypsin and 5 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease I in RPMI 1640 at 34°C for 15 min. The cell aggregates were washed with RPMI 1640, gently pipetted, filtered through a 74-μm nylon mesh, and then centrifuged to obtain an enriched suspension of germ cells. The germ cell suspension of mouse testicles was further purified by unit gravity sedimentation(13.Bellve A.R. Millete C.F. Bhatnagar Y.M. O'Brien D.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), using a 2-4% bovine serum albumin(w/v) gradient, as described(12.Kashiwabara S. Arai Y. Kodaira K. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The purities of the cell populations of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids exceeded 90% in all experiments. Total RNA was extracted from various tissues or cells by the guanidine thiocyanate procedure (14.Chirwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar) followed by CsCl centrifugation, or by the acid guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method(15.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by two cycles of Oligotex dT-30 (Rosch) adsorption, according to the manufacturer's instruction. The RNA samples were denatured with glyoxal or formaldehyde, electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels, and transferred onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.). The blots were probed by 32P-labeled 1.2-kb rLK-6 or by a 2.0-kb KpnI fragment of rat TESK1 cDNA and analyzed by a BAS2000 Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji Film), as described previously (5.Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1605-1612PubMed Google Scholar). A peptide TK-11 (TPSLQLPGARS) (5 mg), corresponding to the common C-terminal sequence of human and rat TESK1, was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (10 mg, Calbiochem) by glutaraldehyde. After dialyzing against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the resultant conjugate was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant and inoculated subcutaneously into two rabbits (1 mg each)(16.Toshima J. Ohashi K. Iwashita S. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The rabbits were given a booster every 2 weeks and were bled 1 week later. The IgG fraction was purified from collected antisera with a Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column, and an anti-TESK1 antibody was further purified on a column of Tresyl-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) coupled with the antigenic TK-11 peptide. Expression plasmid for TESK1 was constructed by inserting a 2.45-kb full-size open reading frame of human TESK1 cDNA into the NotI site of PUC-SRα vector(16.Toshima J. Ohashi K. Iwashita S. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17.Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, were transfected with expression plasmids by liposome methods (18.Ito A. Miyazoe R. Mitoma J. Akao T. Osaki T. Kunitake T. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured for 36 h. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were preadsorbed with Protein A-Sepharose (30 μl of 50% slurry) for 1 h at 4°C, centrifuged to remove debris, and incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-TESK1 antibody and Protein A-Sepharose (30 μl of 50% slurry). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), suspended in Laemmli's sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue), and subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked overnight with 3% ovalbumin in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-TESK1 polyclonal antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% ovalbumin. After washing, the membrane was probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham), and immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with kinase assay buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4), and incubated for 12 min at 30°C in 40 μl of kinase assay buffer with 15 μM ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham), in the presence or absence of substrate protein, myelin basic protein (MBP) (0.5 mg/ml, Sigma), histone (0.5 mg/ml, Boehringer), or enolase (0.05 mg/ml, Sigma)(19.Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). The samples were mixed with Laemmli's sample buffer and then resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described(20.Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The region of the membrane containing the radioactive MBP band was excised and incubated with 6 N HCl at 105°C for 2 h. After removal of the membrane, the hydrolysates were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography, and a comparison was made with the ninhydrin-stained phosphoamino acid standards. Direct R-banding fluorescence in situ hybridization was carried out, using the biotinylated human TESK1 cDNA probe, as described elsewhere (21.Hirai M. Suto Y. Kanoh M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To search for possible novel members of LIMK family protein kinases, a rat brain cDNA library was screened under conditions of low stringency hybridization, using as a probe the 32P-labeled cDNA fragment of human LIMK1(5.Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1605-1612PubMed Google Scholar). Of 16 positive clones, 6 were previously identified to encode rat LIMK1 and LIMK2. ( (2)K. Nunoue and K. Mizuno, unpublished data.) Another positive clone, rLK-6, contained the 1.2-kb insert, which encoded a previously unpublished amino acid sequence and was partially homologous to the sequences of LIMK1 and LIMK2. Northern blot analysis revealed that the mRNA probed with rLK-6 insert was preferentially expressed in the rat testis (see Fig. 4A). We therefore screened a rat testis cDNA library, using the rLK-6 cDNA fragment as a probe, and identified 24 positive clones. Nucleotide sequence analysis of several overlapping cDNA clones yielded a 3600-base pair sequence, which has a single long open reading frame encoding a novel protein (termed TESK1) of 628 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A). The initiation ATG codon at nucleotides 1131-1133 resides in the Kozak consensus sequence (22.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) and is preceded by an ∼1.1-kb 5′-noncoding region, which contains several in-frame stop codons. An ∼0.6-kb 3′-noncoding sequence includes a poly(A) tail and two polyadenylation signals (AATAAA). Some of the isolated clones had a shorter 0.3-kb 3′-noncoding sequence with a poly(A) tail 30-34-bases downstream of a 5′-side AATAAA signal. The size of the combined cDNA sequence (3.6 kb) coincides with the size of mRNA, measured by Northern analysis (see Fig. 4A); hence, the cloned cDNAs probably cover a practically full-length sequence of rat TESK1 mRNA.Figure 1:Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of rat (A) and human (B) TESK1. The nucleotides and deduced amino acids are numbered on the left and right. A putative initiation Met codon is circled. The protein kinase domain is underlined by a thin line. The putative polyadenylation signals, AATAAA, are underlined by thick lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The overlapping cDNA clones encoding human TESK1 were isolated from a human HepG2 hepatoma cDNA library, using the rat TESK1 cDNA fragment as a probe. Fig. 1B shows the combined 2,452-base pair nucleotide sequence and the predicted 626-amino acid sequence of human TESK1. Compared with the rat cDNA, human TESK1 cDNA contained a relatively shorter 5′-noncoding sequence. The predicted amino acid sequences of rat and human TESK1 share characteristic structural features, composed of an N-terminal protein kinase consensus sequence and a C-terminal extracatalytic sequence highly rich in proline residues. The overall amino acid sequence identity of rat and human TESK1 is 92%, and identities within the protein kinase domain and the C-terminal proline-rich domain are 97% and 90%, respectively. A hydropathy plot analysis of TESK1 showed no hydrophobic segment indicative of a signal sequence or a transmembrane domain, suggesting that TESK1 functions as an intracellular protein. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the protein kinase domain of TESK1 with known protein kinases revealed that TESK1 shared 17 out of 21 highly conserved residues throughout the protein kinase superfamily (3.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). In the protein kinase domain, TESK1 is most similar to LIMK1 (49% identity) and LIMK2 (50% identity), while identities to other protein kinases are at most 32%. Phylogenetic analysis of the kinase domains also revealed that TESK1 forms an obvious cluster with LIMK1 and LIMK2 (bootstrap probability; 100%), and they are clearly separated from other known protein kinases on the tree (Fig. 3). Thus, although the overall domain structure of TESK1 is entirely different from those of LIMKs (LIMK1 and LIMK2) (Fig. 2B), TESK1 can be grouped as a distant relative of a LIMK subfamily. In addition, TESK1 and LIMKs are located on the phylogenetic tree adjacent to the activin receptor and Daf-1 within a serine/threonine kinase family. This suggests that the LIMK/TESK1 subfamily belongs to the serine/threonine kinase subfamily and may be phylogenetically related to the activin receptor/Daf-1 subfamily.Figure 3:Phylogenetic tree of protein kinases inferred from a comparison of kinase domain sequences. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by comparing protein kinase domain sequences, using the neighbor-joining method(36.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). The bootstrap probability (37.Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at each branching point is shown. Branches including tyrosine kinases (TK) are indicated. Sequence data were taken from the GenBank (TM) data base (release 88.0).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The protein kinase domain is subdivided into 12 subdomains(2.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 3.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The short sequence motif in subdomain VIB is highly conserved within serine/threonine kinases and within tyrosine kinases. In this region, TESK1 contains an unusual short sequence motif DLTSKN, which does not match the consensus sequence for either serine/threonine kinases (DLKXXN) or tyrosine kinases (DLRAAN or DLAARN). This is also the case of LIMK1 and LIMK2, both of which possess a sequence motif DLNSHN in this region(5.Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1605-1612PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ohashi K. Toshima J. Tajinda K. Nakamura T. Mizuno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, we could not predict the substrate specificity of TESK1 from the sequence in this motif. TESK1 has no basic kinase insert sequence, which is observed between subdomain VII and VIII in LIMK1 and LIMK2(5.Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1605-1612PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ohashi K. Toshima J. Tajinda K. Nakamura T. Mizuno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Another notable structural feature of TESK1 is the presence of a proline-rich region at the C terminus. Within the C-terminal 315 and 308 amino acid residues of rat and human TESK1, there are 64 and 63 proline residues, respectively, which correspond to 20% of residues within the C-terminal half. Additionally, the C-terminal half of TESK1 is also rich in Ser, Thr, and Glu residues and might be the region for the rapid protein degradation signal known as a PEST sequence(23.Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of TESK1 gene expression was examined by Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNAs from various tissues of adult rat, using as a probe the rat TESK1 cDNA fragment. A major band of TESK1 mRNA, with a size of ∼3.6 kb, was detected almost exclusively in the testis (Fig. 4A). The relatively broad band of the mRNA may be due to the presence of transcripts derived by alternative use of two polyadenylation signals. A faint band of 2.5 kb was barely detectable in all tissues examined, after longer exposure (data not shown). It remains to be determined whether this 2.5-kb mRNA represents an alternatively spliced transcript of TESK1 or a cross-hybridized one from a closely related gene. The 3.6-kb mRNA of TESK1 was clearly detected in the total cellular RNA of rat spermatogenic cells, as in the case of mRNA of acrosin(12.Kashiwabara S. Arai Y. Kodaira K. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a serine protease localizing in the sperm acrosome (Fig. 4B). Thus, the TESK1 mRNA was found to be mainly expressed in the testicular germ cells of the adult rat. A similar pattern of TESK1 gene expression was observed in adult mouse tissues (Fig. 5A). Of 10 different mouse tissues examined, expression of TESK1 mRNA with the size of about 4.0 kb was detected only in the testis. No significant hybridization signal was detectable in other tissues, including the ovary. Expression of TESK1 mRNA was also observed in testicular RNAs from other species, including monkey, dog, guinea pig, and hamster, when the rat TESK1 cDNA fragment was used as a hybridization probe (data not shown). In human cell lines, a faint band of 2.5-kb mRNA, which hybridized to human TESK1 cDNA fragment, was detected in HepG2 hepatoma, A431 epidermoid carcinoma, and Lu99 lung carcinoma cells, while KB epidermoid carcinoma, HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cells, and THP-1 acute monocytic leukemia cells gave no apparent mRNA hybridization signal (data not shown). To examine the developmental pattern of TESK1 mRNA accumulation in mouse testis, the testicular total RNAs from prepuberal (14-24-day-old) and sexually mature (70-day-old) mice were analyzed by Northern blotting, using rat TESK1 cDNA as a probe. About 4.0-kb TESK1 mRNA was first detectable in the testis at the 18th day of postnatal development. The level of TESK1 mRNA expression increased progressively with postnatal development (Fig. 5B). This expression pattern of the TESK1 gene was apparently consistent with the temporal appearance of haploid round spermatids in the seminiferous epithelium of mouse; approximately 1, 4, and 10% of total spermatogenic cells differentiate into the round spermatids at the 18th, 20th, and 22nd postnatal day, respectively (24.Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). To verify whether or not the TESK1 gene is specifically expressed in haploid male germ cells after meiosis, total RNAs from purified populations of pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and a mixture of elongating spermatids and residual bodies (a residual body fraction) were subjected to Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5C). The TESK1 gene was most abundantly expressed in round spermatids, but a lower level of TESK1 mRNA was present in pachytene spermatocytes and a residual body fraction. Although a very small amount of multinucleate spermatids is usually contaminated in the purified population of the pachytene spermatocytes, it is most likely that expression of the TESK1 gene initiates during meiosis prior to the haploid phase of spermatogenesis and continues through the early stages of spermiogenesis. In view of the unusual sequence of the protein kinase domain of TESK1, it is particularly important to verify the kinase activity and substrate specificity of this protein. The expression plasmid containing the full-length coding region of human TESK1 cDNA was transfected into COS cells, and the expression of TESK1 protein was analyzed by immunoblotting, using anti-TESK1 polyclonal antibodies raised against the synthetic C-terminal 11-amino acid peptide of TESK1. As shown in Fig. 6A, two major immunoreactive bands with estimated molecular masses of about 68 and 80 kDa were detected in COS cells transfected with TESK1 cDNA (COS/TESK1 cells), while no such band was detected in the lysates of COS cells mock-transfected with the vector DNA alone (COS/mock cells). Thus, these bands are thought to be products derived from the ectopically expressed human TESK1 cDNA. A slowly migrating 80-kDa protein, although its apparent molecular mass is significantly higher than the molecular mass predicted from the analysis of TESK1 cDNA, appears to be a primary translation product with a full-length amino acid sequence of TESK1. The high proline content of TESK1 seems to be responsible for the unusually slow migration of the protein on SDS-PAGE, which has been noted for other proline-rich proteins, such as zyxin and Kruppel(38.Sadler I. Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). A rapidly migrating protein with an apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa may be a proteolytically processed product. When lysates of COS/TESK1 cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-TESK1 antibody, separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the same antibody, protein bands corresponding to 68- and 80-kDa TESK1 proteins appeared (Fig. 6B, lane 1). These bands were not detectable when the lysates were immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum (Fig. 6B, lane 3) or with the anti-TESK1 antibody preincubated with excess amounts of antigenic peptide (Fig. 6B, lane 4).

Here we demonstrate that Sim, in analogy to the structurally related bHLH/PAS dioxin receptor, was stably associated with the molecular chaperone hsp90. In the case of the dioxin receptor, release of hsp90 and derepression of receptor function appear to be regulated by ligand binding and dimerization with Arnt, a non-hsp90-associated bHLH/PAS factor. Dimerization with Arnt very efficiently disrupted Sim•hsp90 interaction, a process that required both the bHLH and PAS dimerization motifs of Arnt. Moreover, hsp90 was also released upon dimerization of Sim with the Drosophila PAS factor Per, whereas the hsp90-associated dioxin receptor failed to interact with Sim. These results indicate that hsp90 may play a role in conditional regulation of Sim function, and that Per and possibly bHLH/PAS partner factors may activate Sim by inducing release of hsp90 during the dimerization process.

As these methods are increasingly parallelized, optimization performance initially improves but then abruptly degrades to no better than that of random search beyond a certain point. The existence of this transition is demonstrated for a family of generalized spin-glass models and the traveling salesman problem. Finite-size scaling is used to characterize size-dependent effects near the transition, and analytical insight is obtained through a mean-field approximation."

https://openalex.org/W2091190896,"Two new polyaminolipids have been synthesized for the purpose of improving cellular uptake of oligonucleotides. The amphipathic compounds are conjugates of spermidine or spermine linked through a carbamate bond to cholesterol. The polyaminolipids are relatively nontoxic to mammalian cells. In tissue culture assays, using fluorescent-tagged or radiolabeled triple helix-forming oligonucleotides, spermine-cholesterol and spermidine-cholesterol significantly enhance cellular uptake of the oligomers in the presence of serum. Spermine-cholesterol is comparable with DOTMA/DOPE (a 1:1 (w/w) formulation of the cationic lipid N-[1-(2,3-di oleyloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA) and the neutral lipid dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)) in increasing cellular uptake of oligonucleotides, while spermidine-cholesterol is more efficient. The internalized oligonucleotides are routed to the nucleus as early as 20 min after treatment, suggesting that the polyaminolipids increase the permeability of cellular membranes to oligonucleotides. At later times, much of the incoming oligonucleotides are sequestered within punctate cytoplasmic granules, presumably compartments of endosomal origin. Coadministration with polyaminolipids markedly improves the cellular stability of the oligonucleotides; more than 80% of the material can be recovered intact up to 24 h after addition to cells. In the absence of the polyaminolipids, nearly all of the material is degraded within 6 h.

Oligonucleotides that specifically interfere with gene expression at the transcriptional or translational levels have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents to control the synthesis of deleterious proteins associated with viral, neoplastic, or other diseases. It is possible to select single-stranded oligonucleotides that recognize and bind to the major groove of a stretch of double-stranded DNA in a sequence-specific manner to form a triple helix(1.Morgan A.R.

Similarly, in vitro translation assays have been used to demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotides can bind mRNA targets and prevent protein synthesis(16.Uhlmann E. Peyman A. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 543-584Crossref Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, 17.Cohen, J. S., Hogan, M. E. (1994) Sci. Am. 76–82Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the biological efficacy of most oligonucleotides is drastically reduced if further testing is conducted in living cells. Factors such as the efficiency of cellular uptake, susceptibility to intra- and extra-cellular nucleases, salt concentration, and nonspecific association with cellular or extracellular components may adversely affect the specific function of oligonucleotides in cells(18.Milligan J.F. Matteucci M.D. Martin J.C. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 1923-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Typical triple helix-forming and antisense oligonucleotides are large (∼5000-10,000 Da) hydrophilic compounds that do not enter cells or reach their intracellular targets efficiently. Unprotected phosphodiester oligonucleotides are highly susceptible to nucleases in the serum and inside cells, but their t1/2in vivo can be increased from a few minutes to several hours by simply blocking the 3′ end, for example by a propanolamine group (19.Nelson P.S. Sherman-Gold R. Leon R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7179-7186Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20.Nelson P.S. Frye R.A. Liu E.

More extensive modifications to the backbone (e.g. phosphorothioate or methylphosphonate backbones) or to individual bases can also result in greater in vivo stability, binding affinity, and uptake properties of the oligonucleotides(17.Cohen, J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 139-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Uptake studies in cultured cells using fluorescent oligonucleotides show that the internalized material accumulates inside granular cytoplasmic compartments, most likely of endosomal or lysosomal origin, and only a small fraction reaches the nucleus(29.Loke S.L. Stein C.A. Zhang X.H. Mori K. Nakanishi M. Subasinghe C. Cohen J.S. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3474-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 30.Jaroszewski J.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when oligonucleotides are introduced directly into the cytosol by microinjection, nearly all of the material is quickly transported to the nucleus with a t1/2 of approximately 5 min(32.Chin D.J. Green G.A. Zon G. Szoka F.C. Straubinger R.M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 1091-1100PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Leonetti J.P. Mechti N. Degols G. Gagnor C. Lebleu B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2702-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that for oligonucleotides, movement across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane is the rate-limiting step in the import process. One approach to improve the cellular penetration of oligonucleotides is the coadministration of oligonucleotides with cationic lipids(34.Bennett C.F. Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Wagner R.W. Matteucci M.D. Lewis J.G. Gutierrez A.J. Moulds C. Froehler B.C. Science. 1993; 260: 1510-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). This class of uptake enhancer has found wide application in facilitating delivery of DNA(36.Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar, 37.Felgner J.H. Kumar R.

Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar), and protein (39.Walker C. Selby M. Erickson A. Cataldo D. Valensi J.P. Van-Nest G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7915-7918Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) into living cells. The mechanism by which these amphipathic compounds promote nucleic acid entry into cells is unknown, but it is possible that the cationic portion interacts with the nucleic acid, while the hydrophobic lipid group associates with membrane lipid bilayers, resulting in fusion with or transient disruption of the membrane and discharge of the nucleic acids into the cytosol. Cell culture assays have shown that the efficiency of cationic lipid-mediated delivery is influenced by numerous factors, including the composition and quantity of the nucleic acid and cationic lipid, cell type, concentration of serum in the medium, and time of exposure to the cell. In addition, many available cationic lipid preparations are toxic to cells at concentrations near their effective doses if exposure times are extended to several hours(34.Bennett C.F. Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the molecules are not easily metabolized. Thus, there remains a need for less toxic and more efficient delivery vehicles for oligonucleotides and other gene-based therapeutics. To this end, we have synthesized two novel polyaminolipid uptake enhancers, spermine- and spermidine-cholesterol, and have investigated their effect on the cellular uptake and distribution of oligonucleotides. Cholesteryl chloroformate (Aldrich) in methylene chloride was added dropwise to a solution of spermidine or spermine (Aldrich) in methylene chloride and N,N-diisopropylethylamine and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. Conjugation of cholesterol to spermine or spermidine can occur at either end of the polyamine. Because spermidine is an asymmetric molecule, a mixture of two products is expected from its conjugation to a single cholesterol (Fig. 1). The polyamine-(mono)cholesterol conjugates were purified from the reaction mix by chromatography on silica gel columns using methanol:methylene chloride (1:1) as eluent. The final products (white to yellow-white solids) were obtained by evaporation of the solvent and characterized by NMR. The preparations were approximately 95% pure, the remaining mass presumably consisting of polyamine conjugated to two cholesterols. The reagents were kept desiccated at −20°C for long term storage, or when used in cell-based experiments, the polyaminolipids were first solubilized to a concentration of ∼3-5 mg/ml at room temperature and then diluted as necessary in physiological buffers. Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells (ATCC CCL 81, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) ( (1)The abbreviations used are: MEMminimal essential mediumSpCspermine-cholesterolSpdCspermidine-cholesterolDOTMAN-[1-(2, 3-dioleyloxy)-propyl]-N, N, N-trimethylammonium chlorideDOPEdioleylphosphatidylethanolaminePBSphosphate-buffered saline.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

Cells were plated at an initial density of 500 cells/well in 96-well plates (Corning). After 20 h, cells were exposed to various concentrations of spermine-cholesterol (SpC), spermidine-cholesterol (SpdC) or DOTMA/DOPE (Lipofectin®, a 1:1 (w/w) formulation of the cationic lipid N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA) and the neutral lipid dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE); Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 days. Cell proliferation was measured in quadruplicate by the cell titer 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The oligonucleotides (ODN-1 and ODN-F1) used in the experiments described here are variants of a 36-mer G-rich phosphodiester oligonucleotide (5′-gtggttggtggtggtgtgtgggtttggggtgggggg-3') that has been described previously(40.Fennewald S.M. Mustain S. Ojwang J. Rando R.F. Antiviral Res. 1995; 26: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidites (PerSeptive Biosystems, Bedford, MA) on an Applied Biosystems model 394 automated DNA synthesizer. To improve nuclease resistance, the oligonucleotides were modified at their 3′ ends with a propanolamine moiety(21.Zendegui J.G. Vasquez K.M. Tinsley J.H. Kessler D.J. Hogan M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For this, amino modifier CPG (Glen Research, Sterling, VA) was used as the starting support. ODN-F1 was obtained by tagging the 5′ end with fluorescein, using fluorescein amidite during synthesis (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The deprotected compounds were purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose HP; Pharmacia), and the eluted full-length compounds were concentrated and desalted on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) or by membrane filtration (Filtron Technology Corp., Northborough, MA). ODN-1 was radiolabeled at the 5′ end with γ-35S-ATP (DuPont NEN) using polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) according to standard procedures(41.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988Google Scholar), followed by Sephadex G-100 exclusion chromatography (Pharmacia) in 5 mM HEPES-KOH, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, buffer to remove unincorporated label. The specific activity of the purified labeled ODN-1 was approximately 150 Ci/mmol. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in Corning 24-well plates (Corning). After 24 h, the medium in each well was replaced with fresh complete medium containing 0.1 μM unlabeled ODN-1 and 106 cpm 35S-labeled ODN-1 in the presence or absence of SpdC, SpC (each at 10 μg/ml), or DOTMA/DOPE (at 20 μg/ml, of which 10 μg/ml is DOTMA). In preliminary experiments, we had determined that ∼1.5-5-fold excess of SpdC over oligonucleotide (by mass) was optimal for uptake experiments. After 0, 3, 6, or 24 h of incubation, cells were washed six times with MEM, harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment, and washed once more with MEM. The radioactivity associated with cells was quantified by scintillation counting. Intracellular oligonucleotide concentration was calculated based on the specific activity of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide solution and the estimated volume of Vero cells (∼2 × 10-6μl/cell). Cells were seeded at a density of 7500 cells/chamber on eight-chamber microscope slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) in 200 μl of medium. After 24 h, medium in each chamber was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.1 μM (4.44 × 105 cpm) 35S-labeled ODN-1 in the presence or absence of SpdC at a 1:5 mass ratio of oligomer to cationic lipid. Cells were incubated with the oligonucleotide formulations for 30 min and then rinsed four times with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) containing 0.1% sodium azide and fixed with −20°C methanol for 6 min. After fixation and rinsing with D-PBS, the slides were air-dried for approximately 15 min. Microscopy autoradiography procedure was adapted from methods provided by Eastman Kodak Co. and described in Freshney (42.Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Techniques. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York1983Google Scholar). Slides were coated with Kodak NTB2 emulsion (in the darkroom), dried for 1 h, placed in light-tight plastic boxes with desiccant, sealed with electrical tape, and allowed to expose for 6 days at 4°C. Subsequently, slides were developed in Kodak Dektol developer (diluted 1:1 with distilled water) for 2 min, rinsed 15 s in distilled H2O, fixed for 5 min in Kodak Fixer solution, and rinsed 5 times in distilled H2O (∼1 min/wash). Slides were covered with coverslips, mounted with water, and viewed by bright field or phase contrast microscopy on a Nikon Labophot 2 system (Melville, NY). Images were recorded on Kodak Ektachrome ASA400 film. Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates (Corning). After 24 h, the medium in each well was replaced with fresh medium containing 1 μM (4 × 106 cpm) 35S-labeled oligonucleotide and 20 μg/ml SpdC. After 0, 3, 6, or 24 h of incubation, cells were washed six times with MEM, harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment, and washed once more with MEM. The radioactivity associated with whole cells was quantified by scintillation counting of an aliquot. Oligonucleotides were then isolated from the remaining cells by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and electrophoresed on 12% acrylamide/7 M urea gels. The gels were fixed, soaked in intensifying solutions (Entensify; DuPont NEN), dried, and exposed to film. The amount of radioactivity associated with individual bands on gels was quantified by a β-Scope analysis (Endogen, Cambridge, MA). Cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/dish in 60-mm dishes containing several glass coverslips. After 24 h, the medium in each dish was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.1 μM fluorescein-tagged oligonucleotide ODN-F1 in the presence or absence of SpdC (1:5 mass ratio of oligonucleotide to SpdC). At 20 min, 1 h, 5 h, or 24 h after the addition of oligonucleotide, the cells were washed four times with D-PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide, fixed with −20°C methanol at for 6 min (fixation by a 2% paraformaldehyde solution also gave identical results), and washed four more times with D-PBS. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), sealed with clear nail polish, and observed by phase contrast or fluorescence microscopy on a Nikon Labophot 2 system, using 100× objective. Several methods of enhancing oligonucleotide uptake have been established, including lipophilic modification of oligonucleotides (23.Vu H. Singh P. Lewis L. Zendegui J.G. Jayaraman K.

We have focused on cationic lipids as uptake enhancers because of ease of use, feasibility in screening large numbers of oligonucleotides, and potential versatility for delivery of other nucleic acid therapeutics. Although several cationic lipid preparations have been described(54.Kavanov A.V. Kavanov V.A. Bioconjugate Chem. 1995; 6: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 55.Behr J.-P.

In an effort to improve upon available compounds, two novel polyaminolipids, spermine- and spermidine-cholesterol (SpC and SpdC, respectively), have been synthesized (Fig. 1). Components of the polyaminolipids are ubiquitous in mammalian cells. The intracellular concentration of spermine, spermidine, and related polyamines is estimated to be in the millimolar range(57.Sarhan S. Seiler N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The polyamines participate in the structural organization of the genome by binding to the nucleic acids with high affinity and neutralizing their negative charge, allowing the compact packaging of DNA(58.Matthews H.R. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is an abundant constituent of animal cell membranes with a major role in the modulation of membrane fluidity(59.Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). The conjugates of polyamines and cholesterol, joined through a carbamate linkage, are expected to be biodegradable and nontoxic. To test this, the cytotoxic effect of the polyaminolipids on cell proliferation was assayed using a sensitive, nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2, SpdC and SpC had no discernible effect on cells when administered at levels below 25 μg/ml for up to 4 days, and the cells appeared healthy and viable even at concentrations as high as 100 μg/ml. Light microscopic examination of treated cells revealed no gross changes in cellular morphology. In contrast, DOTMA/DOPE was highly toxic to cells above approximately 20 μg/ml (10 μg/ml DOTMA), and at 100 μg/ml there were no viable cells left after 4 days of continuous treatment. Similar viability assays were performed with mixtures of SpdC and oligonucleotides, and again, no cytotoxic effects were observed at below 20 μg/ml of each (data not shown). The half-life of the polyaminolipids in vivo is not yet known, but the carbamate linkage in these carriers is designed to be biodegradable soon after completing delivery of the cargo, thus reducing the potential of observing toxic effects. The carbamate bond is already known to be chemically unstable at high pH and elevated temperatures(60.March J. Advanced Organic Chemistry. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides begin to have some cytotoxic effects of their own at extracellular concentrations above about 50 μM(61.Ojwang J. Elbaggari A. Marshall H.B. Jayaraman K. McGrath M.S. Rando R.F. J. AIDS. 1994; 7: 560-570PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments described in this paper, SpC and SpdC were used at the relatively nontoxic concentrations of 20 μg/ml or less and oligonucleotides at 1 μM or less. The amount of radiolabeled ODN-1 taken up by Vero cells in the presence or absence of various uptake enhancers was quantitated by scintillation counting. Cells were treated with 0.1 μM35S-ODN-1 in the presence or absence of SpdC, SpC, or DOTMA/DOPE. Oligonucleotides were labeled with 35S instead of 32P, because data from preliminary studies showed that terminal 35S is approximately 10-fold more resistant to cleavage by enzymes in the growth medium (data not shown). Incubation of Vero cells with 0.1 μM35 ODN-1 in the absence of cationic lipids resulted in cellular oligonucleotide concentration of approximately 0.3 μM (Fig. 3). Coadministration of the same oligonucleotide with cationic lipids enhanced cellular uptake by 30-65-fold after 24 h of incubation. Improved oligonucleotide uptake by cells in the presence of polyaminolipids was also confirmed by light microscopy autoradiography studies. Vero cells were incubated with 0.1 μM radiolabeled ODN-1 in the presence of SpdC or SpC for 30 min and processed for autoradiography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Observation of dark silver grains in and around the nuclear region indicated that the polyaminolipids had markedly enhanced the uptake of ODN-1 by cells (data not shown). In contrast, untreated cells contained few or no silver grains, confirming the idea that there is very little unaided uptake of oligonucleotides by cells. Among the uptake enhancers, SpdC was significantly more efficient at improving oligonucleotide entry into cells than either SpC or DOTMA/DOPE. To examine the intracellular stability of the oligomers taken up in the presence of cationic lipid, Vero cells were incubated with 1 μM radiolabeled ODN-1 coadministered with 20 μg/ml SpdC. At 0, 3, 6, or 24 h after addition, oligonucleotides were isolated from the cells by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and fractionated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). The absence of significant amounts of degradation products in the cellular oligonucleotide samples suggested that the internalized oligonucleotides are somehow protected from nucleases. Quantification of intact oligonucleotide by β-scope analysis of the gel confirmed that greater than 80% of the radiolabeled material recovered from cells after a 24-h incubation is intact. The phosphodiester oligonucleotides used in these studies were blocked at their 3′ end with a propanolamine moiety to confer greater resistance against serum exonucleases(19.Nelson P.S. Sherman-Gold R. Leon R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7179-7186Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20.Nelson P.S. Frye R.A. Liu E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7187-7194Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21.Zendegui J.G. Vasquez K.M. Tinsley J.H. Kessler D.J. Hogan M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 5′ end seems to require no such protection. Oligonucleotide-3'-propanolamine conjugates have been administered to mice and found to remain intact in the circulation and to be stable in tissues for at least eight hours(21.Zendegui J.G. Vasquez K.M. Tinsley J.H. Kessler D.J. Hogan M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SpdC appears to increase the in vivo stability to an even greater extent, partly because binding of the polyaminolipid to the nucleic acid may prevent the nucleases from recognizing and cleaving the oligonucleotide and partly because the SpdC-ODN complex may be stored within intracellular compartments that are not easily accessible to nucleases (see below). Vero cells were treated with ODN-F1 in the presence or absence of SpC or SpdC and the intracellular localization of fluorescein was examined by microscopy (Fig. 5; only the data using SpdC are shown). In the absence of uptake enhancers, oligonucleotide was taken up by cells at a low level, with much of the internalized material in perinuclear cytoplasmic compartments. Coadministration of SpC or SpdC with oligonucleotide resulted in brighter nuclear fluorescence by 20 min after addition (at earlier time points, from 5 to 15 min, the cell-associated fluorescence was very weak and nuclear fluorescence was barely discernible). The nuclear fluorescein was expected to be still attached to intact oligonucleotides, because studies by Fisher et al.(62.Fisher T.L. Terhorst T. Cao X. Wagner R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3857-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) have shown that fluorescein, if detached from oligonucleotides, is quickly discarded from cells. Cellular and nuclear uptake as early as 20 min after administration of SpdC/oligonucleotide mix to cells suggests that internalization is occurring within the time frames expected of endocytic events. Furthermore, entry into the nucleus indicates that the polyaminolipids can somehow increase the permeability of cellular membranes to the oligonucleotides. At approximately 5 h after treatment, cells exhibited nuclear fluorescence as well as some punctate cytoplasmic staining. Every cell on the slide contained fluorescent material, although there was considerable variability in the amount of oligonucleotide internalized by cells, even within the same microscopic field. Some decrease of nuclear fluorescence was observed after 24-h incubation, concomitant with an accumulation of large fluorescent granules in the cytoplasm. This loss in nuclear fluorescence over time has been seen in other studies (34.Bennett C.F. Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar, 62.Fisher T.L. Terhorst T. Cao X. Wagner R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3857-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and may represent some degradation of the fluorescein or the oligonucleotides in the nucleus, followed by the export of fluorescent metabolites. The composition of the large cytoplasmic granules is currently unknown, but may represent endosomal accumulation of the oligonucleotides. In an effort to confirm this, and to determine whether incubation of cells with SpdC/oligonucleotide leads to altered endosomal morphology, we probed the treated and untreated cells with a monoclonal antibody to the human transferrin receptor (a marker for endosomes), followed by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. Subsequent examination of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed the colocalization of transferrin receptor and internalized oligonucleotides in numerous cytoplasmic compartments (images not shown). In the case of SpdC/ODN-F1-treated cells, the compartments became larger and brighter with increasing time of incubation, confirming that much of the internalized oligonucleotide was sequestered within the endosome-derived vesicles (Fig. 5), protected from cellular nucleases (Fig. 4). Further studies of the polyaminolipids will be required to determine their mechanism of action and how well these compounds improve the actual biological activity of internalized oligonucleotides. Factors that may influence uptake include cell type, ratio of cationic lipid to the oligonucleotide, extracellular pH, and protein and salt concentrations. Moreover, the difference in toxicity and activity between SpC and SpdC would have been difficult to predict based on simple structural information. It was discussed earlier that SpdC described here is really a mixture of two isoforms (Fig. 1). It is not known whether one or both of the isoforms are equally effective at enhancing uptake. Synthesis of individual isoforms would require more complex regioselective synthesis, but may lead to a more effective uptake enhancer. Other polyamine-lipid conjugates (63.Behr J.-P. Demeneix B. Loeffler J.-P. Perez-Mutul J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6982-6986Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) have been widely used for improving the cellular uptake of nucleic acids, but in those compounds the lipids are fatty acyl chains linked through an internal site on the polyamine. That may, in part, account for some of the major differences in the toxicity and uptake properties. The polyamine-cholesterol conjugates described in this report are relatively nontoxic compounds that markedly enhance the uptake of oligonucleotides into cells. It is likely that the activity of the polyaminolipids can be optimized by properly formulating the compounds, e.g. with fusogenic lipids or peptides and/or by chemically altering the polyamine or steroid portions of the molecule. In addition, the delivery system can be further fine-tuned for different types of cells and different types of cargo. It is possible that SpC, SpdC, and a related family of compounds will have a much broader application than for just improving the cellular uptake of oligonucleotides. They may be useful for enhancing the delivery of other nucleic acid-based therapeutics and perhaps even acidic peptides or proteins or other polyanionic therapeutics. We thank Drs. P. A. Cossum, M. E. Hogan, R. F. Rando, G. R. Reyes, G. R. Revankar, R. Varma, and J. G. Zendegui for many helpful discussions. We are grateful to Dr. H.

Herein, its cleavage of Sbr in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes was shown to be minimized by captopril, an inhibitor of certain metallo-endoproteases, whereas this agent only marginally antagonized the inhibition of noradrenaline release, implicating a second action of the toxin. This hypothesis was proven by preparing three mutants (H233A, E234A, H237A) of the LC lacking the ability to cleave Sbr and reconstituting them with native heavy chain. The resultant dichains were found to block synaptosomal transmitter release, albeit with lower potency than that made from wild type LC; as expected, captopril attenuated only the inhibition caused by the protease-active wild type toxin.

Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Re-expression of CD45 by gene transfer overcomes this defect(15.Koretzky G.A. Kohmetscher M.A. Kadleck T. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1138-1142PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, transfection of J45.01 cells with a cDNA encoding a chimeric A2/A2/CD45 molecule (containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human HLA-A2 molecule fused at the eighth cytoplasmic amino acid to the CD45 phosphatase domain) also restores TCR-mediated signal transduction (16.Hovis R. Donovan J. Musci M. Motto D. Goldman F. Ross S. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1993; 260: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of signaling in these cells is reduced when compared to the parental Jurkat line. These data suggest that, although the phosphatase domains of CD45 are sufficient to activate TCR signaling, the extracellular and/or transmembrane domains could optimize these processes, possibly through interaction with other proteins. The in vivo substrates of CD45 have not been well defined. In vitro studies with CD45 fusion proteins have suggested that the intracellular domain of CD45 binds to and dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated ξchains(17.Furukawa T. Itoh M. Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10928-10932Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence also suggests that CD45 controls the state of phosphorylation of p56lck and p59lck, leading to a model that CD45 acts to enhance protein-tyrosine kinase activity, and thus signal transduction, through dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory COOH-terminal tyrosine of Src protein-tyrosine kinases(18.Cahir McFarland E.D.

Recently, the mouse and human cDNAs coding for a novel 30-32-kDa phosphoprotein that noncovalently associates with CD45 have been cloned (21.Schraven B. Kirchgessner H. Gaber B. Samstag Y. Meuer S.

Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the mouse molecule was named CD45-AP (CD45-associated protein)(26.Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We will use the name LPAP in this paper. LPAP is predominantly expressed in lymphocytes and contains a potential transmembrane domain and a short, 10-amino acid-long extracellular domain(25.Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, expression of LPAP appears to correlate with the expression of CD45 in human T lymphocytes, since the CD45-negative Jurkat T cell line J45.01 expresses LPAP mRNA but barely detectable levels of LPAP protein(25.Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of J45.01 has demonstrated that, although similar amounts of LPAP protein are synthesized, the half live time of LPAP in J45.01 is 10-fold less than in the wild-type cells (25.Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that LPAP is degraded in the absence of CD45. Re-expression of wild-type CD45 but not the above A2/A2/CD45 chimera rescues LPAP expression in J45.01. Moreover, when the A2/A2/CD45 chimera is transfected into wild type Jurkat cells, no association is seen with LPAP, although LPAP protein is present in these cells(25.Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that CD45 stabilizes LPAP protein expression, possibly through interaction via the extracellular and/or transmembrane domains. To understand further the composition of the CD45-associated protein complex and its role in TCR signaling, we have mapped the sites of interaction between CD45 and LPAP using CD45 chimeras and LPAP deletion mutants. Our data suggest that the transmembrane regions of both molecules are required for their association. Interestingly, it appears that membrane proximal amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of LPAP must also be present for complete association. Mutations of the LPAP gene (the full-length LPAP cDNA construct (25.Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S.

Plasmid DNA from identified mutant bacterial colonies was sequenced. Since LPAP represents a transmembrane molecule, the leader sequence was deleted from all constructs. Therefore, mutant A (mutA) corresponds to the mature LPAP protein except that the initiator methionine residue is incorporated into the construct. Fig. 1A summarizes all deletion mutants that were used in this study. The following oligonucleotides were used for site-directed mutagenesis: selection oligo (converts the unique Asp700 site of the BluescriptII vector into an Eco47III site), CATCATTGGAAAGCGCTCTTCGGGGC; mutA, GGGCCTGCGGACCAATGTCGGGTGGCAGCGCGG; mutB, GGGCCTGCGGACCAATGTGGCGCCGCCTCAGCCG; mutC1, GGCCTGCGGACCAATGGAGGACAGCGTGGGCTC; mutC2, GTCGGGTGGCAGCGCGTCCAGCTCTGTCACCG; mutC3, GGAGGACAGCGTGGGCGTCACCGTTGTCCTGC; mutC4, CGTGGGCTCCAGCTCTCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGC; mutC5, CTCTGTCACCGTTGTCGCCACTGGCCTAGCAC; mutC6, GCTGCTCCTACTGCTGCTAGCACTGGCCTGGC; mutC7, CTGCTGGCCACTGGCTGGCGCCGCCTCAGCC; mutD1, CCTAGCACTGGCCTGGGACTCAGGGGGCTAC; mutD2, GAAGCCAGAGACAGTGACGGCAGCGCAGCCTGG; mutE1, CGCCGCCTCAGCCGTTACCACCCGGCCCGC; mutE2, GTGACTCAGGGGGCTACCTAGGTGCCGCGCTGTG; mutE3, CTACCACCCGGCCCGCTGGGGCCGCACGCGG. In vitro transcription/translation was performed with the TNT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System from Promega (Heidelberg, FRG) with T7 RNA polymerase. 1 μg of plasmid DNA was used per reaction. L-[4,5-3H]Leucine (5.9 TBq/mmol, Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany) was used as radioactively labeled amino acid. In vitro translated proteins were mixed with post-nuclear lysates corresponding to 2 × 107 Jurkat cells lysed in 1 ml of buffer supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40(21.Schraven B. Kirchgessner H. Gaber B. Samstag Y. Meuer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22.Schraven B. Schirren A. Kirchgessner H. Siebert B. Meuer S.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Primary immunoprecipitates were prepared employing 25 μl of packed CNBr Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) coupled to protein A-purified monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were run on 12% mini slab gels (Bio-Rad, Munich) under reducing conditions. Gels were fixed and soaked in Amplify solution (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Fluorography was performed at −70°C using Amersham Hyperfilm. All expression constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3 (cytomegalovirus promoter, G418 resistant) (Invitrogen) or pAWNeo3 (spleen focus forming virus long terminal repeat, G418 resistant)(15.Koretzky G.A. Kohmetscher M.A. Kadleck T. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1138-1142PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length LPAP cDNA was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3. Wild-type CD45 cDNA was digested with SalI-XbaI and subcloned into the SalI-XbaI sites of pAWNeo3. A2A2CD45 has been previously described(16.Hovis R. Donovan J. Musci M. Motto D. Goldman F. Ross S. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1993; 260: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A2CD45 was made using primers incorporating BbsI-XbaI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, to amplify the CD45 transmembrane domain including eight cytoplasmic domains by polymerase chain reaction. The CD45 cytoplasmic domain of A2A2CD45 in pGEM3 was excised with BbsI-XbaI digestion and replaced with the CD45 transmembrane polymerase chain reaction fragment. Fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction reaction was confirmed by automated sequencing of the product. COS cells were electroporated with 20 μg each of two plasmid DNAs at 10 × 106 cells/0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with settings of 320 V and 960 microfarads and immediately replated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and harvested 48 h later by scraping in 300 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Transfected CD45 chimeric proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates employing 1 μg of CR11.351 (anti-human HLA-A2) monoclonal antibody or 9.4 (anti-CD45) monoclonal antibody bound to 30 μl of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Sigma) pre-armed with 1 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in high salt lysis buffer (Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with 0.35 M NaCl) and one time in lysis buffer and run on 10% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and LPAP was detected as described previously(25.Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that wild-type CD45, but not an A2A2CD45 chimera containing the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 fused to A2 extracellular and transmembrane regions, associates with LPAP in vivo(25.Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that the transmembrane or extracellular region of these proteins could mediate the CD45-LPAP interaction. We attempted to map the sites within the LPAP molecule responsible for its association with CD45 employing LPAP deletion mutants. LPAP mutants were expressed in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and subsequently investigated for their ability to bind wild-type CD45 in lysates of Jurkat cells. This approach was chosen because we expected that cells transfected with LPAP constructs bearing deletions in the transmembrane domain would likely not produce proteins that can be expressed on the cell surface. The deletion constructs used for in vitro translation are summarized in Fig. 1A. The data shown in Fig. 1B demonstrate the specificity of our assay. In vitro translated LPAP (mutA) associates with CD45 but not with HLA-class I, CD49d, CD2, or CD3. We next analyzed mutB, which lacks the extracellular and transmembrane domains of LPAP, for its ability to bind CD45. Fig. 2A demonstrates that while mutA readily associates with CD45, mutB does not. These data indicate that the association of LPAP with CD45 involves the extracellular and/or transmembrane regions of LPAP. We investigated the role of the extracellular domain of LPAP further using mutC1 and C2, which both have a five-amino acid deletion in the extracellular domain (see Fig. 1A). Fig. 2A shows that both mutC1 and mutC2 bind to CD45, demonstrating that deletions in the extracellular domain of LPAP do not diminish the capacity of the protein to interact with CD45. In marked contrast, all deletions within the transmembrane segment of LPAP (mutC3-C7) result in a loss of binding to CD45 (Fig. 2A, lanes I-S). MutC3 and mutC4 (lanes I and L) have a greatly diminished capacity to associate with CD45, while mutC5, mutC6, and mutC7 have completely lost their ability to bind CD45. Although there appear to be quantitative differences in the contribution of individual stretches of amino acids, our data demonstrate that the intact transmembrane region is required to mediate optimal association between the two molecules. Deletions in the cytoplasmic domain of LPAP (mutD1 and mutD2) were designed to investigate whether the LPAP-CD45 association is exclusively mediated via the transmembrane region. The 5 cytoplasmic amino acids directly adjacent to the transmembrane domain are deleted in mutD1, while mutD2 contains a deletion of 30 cytoplasmic amino acids closer to the COOH terminus. As shown in Fig. 2B, lanes A and E, mutD2 associates with CD45 similarly to mutA, demonstrating that this region of the cytoplasmic domain is not required for the association of LPAP and CD45. Interestingly, the deletion in mutD2 appears to induce conformational changes in the molecule that mask the amino terminus because mutD2 is not recognized by antisera directed against the first 10 amino acids of LPAP (not shown). Sequence analysis of mutD2 verified that this construct does not contain mutations in the amino-terminal epitope region that would explain loss of accessible epitopes. Thus, the deletion in the COOH-terminal portion of LPAP apparently alters the conformation of the protein, resulting in non-reactivity with the amino-terminal antisera. However, the mutation within mutD2 does not appear to dramatically alter the conformation of the transmembrane region since the molecule retains the ability to bind CD45. It is important to note at this point that we have most recently obtained a mutant Jurkat cell line (clone 14) that expresses a LPAP variant that carries a single point mutation in the cytoplasmic domain, resulting in a new stop codon 36 amino acids upstream of the original COOH terminus. Interestingly, the mutant LPAP protein expressed by clone 14 is, similarly to mutD2, not recognized by our amino-terminal antisera but still associates with CD45 in vivo. ( (2)E. Bruyns, L. R. Hendricks-Taylor, S. Meuer, G. A. Koretzky, and B. Schraven, unpublished observation.) In contrast to mutD2, the protein encoded by mutD1 does not bind to CD45 (Fig. 2B, lane C), suggesting that the cytoplasmic amino acids closest to the transmembrane region also contribute to the association with CD45. Three mutants (mutE1, mutE2, and mutE3), each containing contiguous deletions of five amino acids starting with those directly adjacent to the deletion in mutD1, were designed to address the question of whether or not additional amino acids within the cytoplasmic domain of LPAP are required to mediate association with CD45. Fig. 2B indicates that mutE1 and mutE2 are strongly impaired in their ability to bind to CD45, while mutE3 associates similarly to wild-type LPAP (mutA). Deletions further downstream of mutE3 do not influence the association between LPAP and CD45 (not shown). These results along with the lack of binding of mutD1 suggest that the 15 cytoplasmic amino acids adjacent to the transmembrane region play a role in CD45 association. We hypothesized that the transmembrane region of CD45, including adjacent cytoplasmic amino acids, was likely the site of interaction with LPAP since this was the region of LPAP that mediated its association with CD45. To confirm this assumption, we created a chimera, A2CD45 (A2 extracellular, CD45 transmembrane and 8 NH3-terminal cytoplasmic amino acids followed by a stop codon, Fig. 3A). This chimera, the A2A2CD45 (A2 extracellular and transmembrane and CD45 cytoplasmic domains) chimera, and wild-type CD45 were cotransfected into COS cells together with a full-length LPAP molecule. CD45 chimeras were immunoprecipitated with an anti-A2 or CD45 monoclonal antibody and analyzed for coprecipitation of LPAP by Western blotting. Fig. 3B demonstrates that LPAP coprecipitates with both wild-type CD45 (lane 4) and the A2CD45 chimera (lane 6). In contrast, LPAP does not associate with the A2A2CD45 chimera (lane 5). The amount of LPAP precipitated with wild-type CD45 and A2CD45 varies between experiments, but CD45 consistently appears to precipitate higher levels of LPAP than A2CD45. This difference is likely due to the fact that the A2 chimeras are expressed at lower levels than wild-type CD45 in COS cells. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional CD45 sequences not present in the A2 chimeras increase CD45 binding affinity for LPAP. An additional chimera, A2CD45CD45 (A2 extracellular domain, CD45 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains) also coimmunoprecipitates LPAP following cotransfection into COS cells (not shown). Thus, transfected LPAP only associates with chimeras that contain the CD45 transmembrane region including eight cytoplasmic amino acids. These data indicate that the CD45-LPAP interaction is mediated via the CD45 transmembrane region and strongly suggest that neither the extracellular nor the intracellular phosphatase domains of CD45 are required to associate with and stabilize LPAP. Our results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments with transfected CD45 chimeras and with in vitro translated LPAP deletion mutants define the sites of interaction between CD45 and LPAP to the transmembrane regions, possibly including the first 8 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 and the first 15 intracellular amino acids of LPAP. The association of cell surface molecules through transmembrane domains has been well documented. For example, the B cell receptor complex Ig heavy chain associates with the accessory molecules Ig-α and Ig-β via their respective transmembrane domains(27.Wienands J. Hombach J. Radbruch A. Riesterer C. Reth M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28.Grupp S.A. Campbell K. Mitchell R.N. Cambier J.C. Abbas A.K. J. Biol.

The transmembrane regions are also the sites of association between the TCR α-chain and the CD3-δ chain(32.John S. Banting G.S. Goodfellow P.N. Owen M.J. Eur. J.

Mariuzza R.A. Ermonval M. Acuto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4131-4135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular interaction between the TCR and CD3 is stabilized through charged amino acids within the transmembrane domains of both molecules. Mutation of only one of these charged amino acids leads to a loss of interaction (34.Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 63: 503-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 35.Cosson P. Lankford S.P. Bonifacino J. Klausner R.D.

Mariuzza R.A. Ermonval M. Acuto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4131-4135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, all deletions in the transmembrane domain of LPAP result in an almost complete loss of binding to CD45, suggesting that their association depends upon the entire sequence of amino acids present in the transmembrane region of LPAP. This pattern of binding activity, together with the high content of hydrophobic amino acids and the absence of charged amino acids in the transmembrane regions of LPAP and CD45, leads us to conclude that the association is mediated by hydrophobic interactions. Similar interactions have been postulated for the interaction of the bovine papillomavirus E5 oncoprotein with the 16-kDa membrane pore-forming protein and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor(38.Goldstein D.J. Andresson T. Sparkowski J.S. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4851-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39.Cohen B.D. Goldstein D.J. Rutledge L. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Schlegel R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5303-5311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the 15 LPAP cytoplasmic amino acids that contribute to the LPAP-CD45 interaction represent a portion of the binding site or whether their deletion results in conformational changes of the transmembrane region that abrogate its ability to interact with CD45. However, a requirement for transmembrane as well as flanking cytoplasmic amino acids has been observed previously for the interaction of MHC class I molecules with the chaperone protein p88 (40.Margolese L. Waneck G.L. Suzuki C.K. Degen E. Flavell R.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17959-17966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous data as well as the transfection data shown here demonstrate that LPAP associates with the transmembrane domain of CD45 and that the LPAP protein is stabilized through its binding to CD45. It is tempting to speculate that in the absence of CD45, particular sequences within the transmembrane region of LPAP become unmasked and thus become accessible to a protease that subsequently induces degradation of the protein. We have also presented data that suggest that deletions in the COOH-terminal region of LPAP alter the conformation of the extracellular amino acids, resulting in non-reactivity with amino-terminal antisera (mutD2, clone 14). In addition, we have reported previously that resting but not activated human T lymphocytes express a hyperphosphorylated form of LPAP (pp29) that is also not reactive with the amino-terminal antisera(25.Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that receptor-mediated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events affecting the COOH-terminal portion of LPAP may indirectly alter the conformation of the extracellular domain. These events could represent a mechanism to regulate the ability of LPAP to bind an external ligand via its intracellular phosphorylation pattern. The biological function of LPAP and its role in lymphocyte activation are unknown. We have shown previously that CD45 and p56lck associate with LPAP(21.Schraven B. Kirchgessner H. Gaber B. Samstag Y. Meuer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22.Schraven B. Schirren A. Kirchgessner H. Siebert B. Meuer S.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the A2A2CD45 chimera that does not associate with LPAP also does not associate with Lck.2 This lack of CD45-Lck association may explain the decreased efficiency of TCR signaling seen with A2A2CD45 in transfected J45.01 (CD45-deficient) when compared to wild-type Jurkat (16.Hovis R. Donovan J. Musci M. Motto D. Goldman F. Ross S. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1993; 260: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We are currently testing this hypothesis by establishing J45.01 stable transfectants expressing A2CD45 and A2CD45CD45 to assay LPAP and Lck binding and TCR signaling efficiency. CD45 associates with LPAP in the absence of Lck in JCam.1 cells(25.Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that CD45 and LPAP associate in the absence of Lck in COS cells. Collectively, these data lead us to speculate that LPAP may serve as a bridge to facilitate the interaction of CD45 with Lck. LPAP thus could be involved in the regulation of the CD45•Lck complex by controlling the interaction between both molecules. Conversely, the conformation and function of LPAP (e.g. its ability to interact with other proteins) could be regulated by the enzymatic activities of CD45 and p56lck. We thank Dr. Sheldon Ratnofsky for kindly providing the variant Jurkat cell line “clone 14” and Henning Kirchgessner and Hans Ulrich Fried for excellent technical assistance."
