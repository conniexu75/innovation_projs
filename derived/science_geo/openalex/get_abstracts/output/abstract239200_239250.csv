https://openalex.org/W2040706148,"Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are critical components of virus-induced immune activation and type I interferon regulation. IRF3 and IRF7 are activated in response to a variety of viruses or after engagement of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and TLR4 by double-stranded RNA and lipopolysaccharide, respectively. The activation of IRF5, is much more restricted. Here we show that in contrast to IRF3 and IRF7, IRF5 is not a target of the TLR3 signaling pathway but is activated by TLR7 or TLR8 signaling. We also demonstrate that MyD88, interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 are required for the activation of IRF5 and IRF7 in the TLR7 signaling pathway. Moreover, ectopic expression of IRF5 enabled type I interferon production in response to TLR7 signaling, whereas knockdown of IRF5 by small interfering RNA reduced type I interferon induction in response to the TLR7 ligand, R-848. IRF5 and IRF7, therefore, emerge from these studies as critical mediators of TLR7 signaling."

Overexpression of the βIII-tubulin isotype has been associated with paclitaxel resistance in a number of cancer cell lines and in tumors, but the mechanism of resistance has remained unclear. Paclitaxel inhibits cancer cell proliferation by binding to the β-subunit of tubulin in microtubules and suppressing microtubule dynamic instability, leading to mitotic arrest and cell death. We hypothesized that βIII-tubulin overexpression induces resistance to paclitaxel either by constitutively enhancing microtubule dynamic instability in resistant cells or by rendering the microtubules less sensitive to the suppression of dynamics by paclitaxel. Using Chinese hamster ovary cells that inducibly overexpress either βI- or βIII-tubulin, we analyzed microtubule dynamic instability during interphase by microinjection of rhodamine-labeled tubulin and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. In the absence of paclitaxel, there were no differences in any aspect of dynamic instability between the two β-tubulin-overexpressing cell types. However, in the presence of 150 nm paclitaxel, dynamic instability was suppressed to a significantly lesser extent (suppressed only 12%) in cells overexpressing βIII-tubulin than in cells overexpressing similar levels of βI-tubulin (suppressed 47%). The results suggest that overexpression of βIII-tubulin induces paclitaxel resistance by reducing the ability of paclitaxel to suppress microtubule dynamics. The results also suggest that endogenous regulators of microtubule dynamics may differentially interact with individual tubulin isotypes, supporting the idea that differential expression of tubulin isotypes has functional consequences in cells.

Microtubules are dynamic polymers composed of αβ-tubulin heterodimers that, both in vitro and in living cells, can continuously grow and shorten through tubulin dimer addition and loss at the microtubule ends. Dynamic microtubules are required for many processes in cells including cell migration, cell signaling, and mitosis (1.Valiron O. Caudron N. Job D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2069-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Mitosis is particularly sensitive to changes in microtubule dynamics, and mitotic progression depends upon the maintenance of microtubule dynamics and microtubule polymer levels within a narrow range (2.Goncalves A. Braguer D. Kamath K. Martello L. Briand C. Horwitz S. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11737-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 3.Cabral F. Drug Resist.

Paclitaxel is an extremely effective microtubule-targeted anticancer drug used to treat a wide range of tumor types (7.Jordan M.A. Curr. Med. Chem.-Anti-Cancer Agents. 2002; 2: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The binding of paclitaxel to tubulin in microtubules arrests cells in mitosis, leading to cell death (8.Jordan M.A. Wendell K.L. Gardiner S. Derry W.B. Copp H. Wilson L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar). Acquired resistance to paclitaxel is one of the most significant reasons for its failure in chemotherapy (3.Cabral F. Drug Resist. Update. 2001; 4: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Determining the molecular mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance is of great clinical value both in the design of chemotherapeutic treatment strategies and in the development of drugs to avoid or overcome resistance. The antimitotic and antiproliferative effects of paclitaxel are attributed to its ability to suppress microtubule dynamics and to induce microtubule polymerization and bundling (9.Schiff P.B. Horwitz S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 10.Derry W.B. Wilson L.

Because the lowest concentrations of paclitaxel that effectively inhibit cell proliferation and block mitosis suppress microtubule dynamics (6.Yvon A.-M. Wadsworth P. Jordan M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 947-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 12.Kamath K. Jordan M.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6026-6031PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Honore S. Kamath K. Braguer D. Horwitz S.B. Wilson L. Briand C. Jordan M.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4957-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) without significantly increasing microtubule polymer levels, suppression of microtubule dynamics appears to be its most potent mechanism of mitotic arrest (14.Jordan M.A. Toso R.J. Thrower D. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9552-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Paclitaxel binds to the β-subunit of tubulin, of which at least seven isotypes exist at the protein level in humans: βI, βII, βIII, βIVa, βIVb, βV, and βVI. The β-isotypes differ primarily within the C-terminal 15–20 amino acids, a region of the protein that lies on the exterior of the microtubule and is the putative binding site for several microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein, CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein, CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; HA, hemagglutinin.

Expression of some tubulin isotypes is restricted to specific tissues, whereas other isotypes are constitutively expressed, resulting in a unique pattern of expression for each tissue. In non-neuronal cells, βI is often the predominant tubulin isotype, whereas βIII-tubulin is generally expressed at very low levels. Tumor cells often express a different complement of β-tubulin isotypes than their normal counter-parts (18.Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytology. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of variations in tubulin isotype expression in both normal and tumor cells is not known. Overexpression of βIII-tubulin has been associated with paclitaxel resistance in cell lines and in tumors (19.Kavallaris M. Kuo D.Y.-S. Burkhardt C.A. Regl D.L. Norris M.D. Haber M. Horwitz S.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Kavallaris et al. (20.Kavallaris M. Burkhardt C.A. Horwitz S.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) showed that paclitaxel-resistant A549 cells overexpressed βIII-tubulin compared with their sensitive counter-parts and that partial sensitivity to paclitaxel was regained by down-regulation of βIII-tubulin in these cells. Hari et al. (21.Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) recently showed that overexpression of βIII-tubulin conferred 1.5–2-fold resistance to paclitaxel in CHO cells; however, the mechanism of resistance remains unclear. We hypothesized that βIII-tubulin induces paclitaxel resistance by generating inherently more dynamic microtubules or by rendering the microtubules less responsive to the suppressive effects of paclitaxel on microtubule dynamics, thus allowing cells to maintain sufficiently rapid microtubule dynamics in the presence of paclitaxel to complete mitosis. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed microtubule dynamic instability in CHO cells induced to overexpress βIII-tubulin or βI-tubulin, in the absence and presence of paclitaxel. We found that increased levels of βIII-tubulin did not affect microtubule dynamic instability in the absence of paclitaxel. However, in the presence of paclitaxel, microtubules in βIII-tubulin-overexpressing cells were significantly more dynamic than in either βI-tubulin-overexpressing cells or uninduced controls. Our results support the hypothesis that increased levels of βIII-tubulin directly induce paclitaxel resistance by rendering microtubules less sensitive to the effects of paclitaxel. In addition, our results suggest that tubulin isotype composition can regulate dynamic instability through the differential effects of endogenous regulators on microtubules of different isotype compositions. All materials were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Cell Culture, Microinjection, and Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics—CHO cells were stably transfected with C-terminal HA-tagged βI- or βIII-tubulin under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter (21.Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) such that in the presence of tetracycline, expression of the transfected β-tubulin was repressed (“tet-off”) and expression of the protein was induced when tetracycline was removed from the medium. In normal CHO cells, βI-tubulin is the predominant β-isotype comprising ∼70% of the total β-tubulin pool. CHO cells additionally express lower levels of βIVb-tubulin (25%) and βV-tubulin (5%) (22.Sawada T. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Ahmad S. Singh B. Gupta R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). βIII-tubulin is normally not expressed. After induction of HA-βI- or HA-βIII-tubulin expression, the percentages of each β-tubulin isotype were 80, 14, 5, and 1% for the HA-β-tubulin, endogenous βI, βIVb, and βV, respectively (21.Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in α modification of minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), non-essential amino acids, 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mg/ml G418 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were seeded at a density of 8 × 104 cells/2 ml in a 6-well plate onto poly-l-lysine-treated, gridded glass CELLocate coverslips (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) with/without tetracycline. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline after 8 h to remove any residual tetracycline and incubated for an additional 16 h, followed by a 24-h incubation in medium containing a reduced concentration of fetal bovine serum (2%) to promote cell flattening. Rhodamine tubulin was prepared by carboxyrhodamine labeling (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) of microtubules assembled from phosphocellulose-purified bovine brain tubulin (24.Hyman A. Drechsel D. Kellogg D. Salser S. Sawin K. Steffen P. Wordeman L. Mitchison T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To visualize microtubule dynamic instability, cells were microinjected with rhodamine-labeled tubulin (2.5 mg/ml) as described previously (2.Goncalves A. Braguer D. Kamath K. Martello L. Briand C. Horwitz S. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11737-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Paclitaxel was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at -80 °C until use. For experiments involving paclitaxel, cells were incubated with 150 nm paclitaxel for an additional 5 h prior to imaging and transferred to recording medium lacking paclitaxel during imaging (15 min-2 h). Time-lapse Microscopy, Image Acquisition, and Analysis of Dynamic Instability—Microscopy and analysis of dynamic instability have been described elsewhere (2.Goncalves A. Braguer D. Kamath K. Martello L. Briand C. Horwitz S. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11737-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 12.Kamath K. Jordan M.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6026-6031PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were sealed in a Rose chamber in recording medium containing 30 μl/ml Oxyrase (Oxyrase Inc., Mansfield, OH). 31–46 images were captured at 4-s intervals. The growth and shortening dynamics of individual microtubules were tracked using the track points function of Metamorph, converted to life history plots, and analyzed using real time measurement software (25.Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Dynamicity and time- and length-based catastrophe and rescue frequencies were calculated per microtubule as described previously (12.Kamath K. Jordan M.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6026-6031PubMed Google Scholar). Mitotic Index—Cells were plated at a concentration of 8 × 104 cells/2 ml into 6-well plates. After 48 h, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of paclitaxel at a range of concentrations (0.03–10 μm) for 6 h. Fixation, staining, and determination of mitotic indices were performed on all cells, both floating and attached, as described in Ref. 12.Kamath K. Jordan M.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6026-6031PubMed Google Scholar. Results are the mean and S.D. of five experiments, in each of which 500 cells were counted per drug concentration. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were pre-extracted for 30 s in TBS (20 mm Tris, 150 mm sodium chloride) containing 0.5% Triton X and fixed in 10% formalin (37 °C) or methanol (0 °C). Nonspecific antibody staining was blocked with TBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-HA antibody (1:100; AbCAM, Cambridge, UK) or mouse anti-HA antibody and YL1/2 rat anti-tubulin antibody, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) and Rhodamine Red-X goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Jackson Immunolaboratories, Westgrove, PA). Nuclei were stained with 4′, 6 diamidino-2-phenylindole. We used paclitaxel-resistant CHO cells overexpressing HA-tagged βIII-tubulin and paclitaxel-sensitive HA-βI-tubulin-overexpressing cells to determine whether βIII-tubulin expression differentially affects microtubule dynamics in the presence or absence of paclitaxel. In normal CHO cells, βI-tubulin is the predominant β-tubulin isotype. βIII-tubulin is normally not expressed (21.Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because we analyzed microtubule dynamics in individual cells, it was important to confirm that all the cells expressed similar levels of HA-βI- or HA-βIII-tubulin after inducing expression under the conditions used to analyze dynamic instability. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 48 h and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy (see “Materials and Methods”). In the absence of tetracycline (Fig. 1, A, C, E, G), all of the cells expressed HA-βI-(A, E) or HA-βIII-(C, G) tubulin at approximately equivalent levels, whereas in the presence of tetracycline, expression of the transfected β-tubulin was repressed and levels were negligible (B, D, F, H). In Fig. 1, E–H, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of tetracycline (to repress or induce HA-β-tubulin expression, respectively), and cells were labeled with an antibody to HA (green) and tubulin (red) and the images were overlaid. In induced cells, HA-βI-(E) or HA-βIII-tubulin (G) (green) coassembled with endogenous tubulin (red) producing yellow microtubules. Uninduced cells (F, H) expressed extremely low levels of HA-β-tubulin, indicated by red microtubules. To determine the effects of overexpressed βIII-tubulin on microtubule dynamic instability, cells overexpressing βIII- or βI-tubulin were microinjected with rhodamine-labeled tubulin. The dynamic instability of individual microtubules in the peripheral regions of the two cell types was observed and recorded by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and quantified (see “Materials and Methods”). As expected from previous studies of microtubule dynamic instability, in βI-overexpressing cells many of the individual microtubules underwent periods of slow growth and more rapid shortening within the 3-min observation period. For example, as shown in Table I, in βI-overexpressing cells, microtubules grew at a mean rate of 14.4 ± 6.8 μm/min and shortened approximately twice as fast, at a mean rate of 33.2 ± 12.8 μm/min. The parameters of microtubule dynamics in βIII-overexpressing cells were virtually identical to those of β1-overexpressing cells (Table I, compare data columns 1 and 2). Thus, by itself, overexpression of βIII-tubulin in CHO cells does not significantly affect the dynamic instability of interphase microtubules.Table IMicrotubule dynamic instability in CHO cells overexpressing βI- or βIII-tubulin Values are means ± S.D.

As shown in Fig. 2, in the absence of paclitaxel 3.2% of the cells were in mitosis. The mitotic index increased to 4.8% at 0.1 μm paclitaxel, and arrest was maximal by 1 μm (∼16%). We analyzed microtubule dynamic instability in cells incubated with 150 nm paclitaxel, at which the mitotic index was ∼6%. At this concentration, the microtubules remained somewhat dynamic, but the effects of paclitaxel were clearly detectable. Paclitaxel had relatively minor effects on dynamic instability in βIII-overexpressing cells, whereas the drug significantly suppressed many parameters of microtubule dynamics in βI-overexpressing cells (Table I, compare data columns 1 and 3). The major effects of paclitaxel in βI-overexpressing cells are summarized in data column 1 of Table II; the growth rate was suppressed by 31%, the growth length by 45%, the shortening rate by 54%, the shortening length by 55%, and the overall microtubule dynamicity by 47%.Table IIEffects of paclitaxel on microtubule dynamic instability in CHO cells overexpressing βI- or βIII-tubulinParameter150 nm PaclitaxelβI-TubulinβIII-TubulinβIII-Tubulin (uninduced)% change from βI control% change from βI control% change from βI controlGrowth rate-31-7-28Growth length-45-17-45Shortening rate-54-32-56Shortening length-55-34-59Dynamicity-47-12-45 Open table in a new tab By contrast, only two parameters of microtubule dynamic instability were significantly affected by 150 nm paclitaxel in βIII-overexpressing cells, the shortening rate (-32%) and the shortening length (-34%), and these changes resulted in only an insignificant change in overall dynamicity (-12%) (see data columns 2 and 4 in Table I and the summary in data column 2 in Table II). To rule out the possibility that the effects we observed were due to other additional genetic changes that had occurred in the βIII-overexpressing cells as a result of transfection or extensive passaging, we analyzed dynamic instability in βIII-overexpressing cells under non-inducing conditions in the presence of paclitaxel. These cells expressed very low levels of βIII-tubulin (Fig. 1, D, H). Paclitaxel (150 nm) suppressed microtubule dynamics to levels in βIII-uninduced cells nearly identical to those in βI cells. (Compare data columns 3 and 5 in Table I and compare percentages in data columns 1 and 3 in Table II.) We found that βIII-tubulin overexpression induces paclitaxel resistance by decreasing the efficacy of paclitaxel binding to βIII-tubulin, resulting in a weaker suppressive effect on microtubule dynamics. The results are also the first direct demonstration that drugs can differentially interact with different tubulin isotypes in cells, suggesting that microtubule dynamic instability might be regulated by the differential interaction of endogenous regulators with the individual isotypes as well. Overexpression of βIII-Tubulin Does Not Cause an Inherent Increase in Dynamic Instability as Compared with Overexpression of βI-Tubulin—One mechanism by which βIII-tubulin has been proposed to mediate resistance to paclitaxel is to constitutively increase microtubule dynamics, such that in the presence of paclitaxel microtubules would remain sufficiently dynamic to complete mitosis (2.Goncalves A. Braguer D. Kamath K. Martello L. Briand C. Horwitz S. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11737-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In living interphase CHO cells in the absence of paclitaxel, overexpression of βIII-tubulin did not significantly alter any parameters of microtubule dynamic instability. Thus, in these cells a high level of βIII-tubulin overexpression does not cause an inherent increase in dynamic instability, indicating that this is not the mechanism of βIII-tubulin-induced resistance. Hari et al. (21.Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) showed previously that in the βIII-tubulin-overexpressing CHO cells polymer mass was decreased by ∼30%. Taken together, these results suggest that a reduction in polymer mass does not necessitate a change in cellular microtubule dynamics. This result also suggests that in our previous study of paclitaxel-resistant and -dependent A549 cells (2.Goncalves A. Braguer D. Kamath K. Martello L. Briand C. Horwitz S. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11737-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the increased microtubule dynamics resulted not from the increased levels of βIII-tubulin but rather from other changes associated with resistance (a mutation in the putative stathmin and MAP4 binding site in conjunction with increased levels of unphosphorylated (active) stathmin and phosphorylated (inactive) MAP4 (26.Martello L.A. Verdier-Pinard P. He L. Torres K. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1207-1213PubMed Google Scholar)). The lack of a difference in microtubule dynamics parameters in the absence of paclitaxel observed in the present study in cells overexpressing either βI- or βIII-tubulin is perhaps surprising. In two previous in vitro studies, the microtubules assembled from αβIII-tubulin were significantly more dynamic than microtubules assembled from αβIV-tubulin. For example, comparison of their dynamicities indicated that αβIII-microtubules were 2.2-fold more dynamic than αβIV-microtubules in one study (27.Panda D. Miller H.P. Banerjee A. Luduena R.F. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11358-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and 1.7-fold more dynamic in a second study (28.Derry W.B. Wilson L. Khan I.A. Luduena R.F. Jordan M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3554-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The sequence of βIV resembles that of βI; thus one might expect that microtubules in cells overexpressing βIII-tubulin might be more dynamic than those in cells overexpressing βI-tubulin. In cells, tubulin undergoes post-translational modifications and interacts with a large number of microtubule regulatory proteins (ranging from proteins that induce catastrophe to those that stabilize microtubule dynamics) (11.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3498) Google Scholar); thus the dynamics of individual isotypes may be significantly altered in cells. Paclitaxel Has a Weaker Effect on Dynamic Instability in βIII-Tubulin-overexpressing Cells—Microtubules in cells overexpressing βIII-tubulin were significantly less susceptible to the suppressive effects of paclitaxel than in control cells. In controls (βI-overexpressing cells or uninduced βIII-tubulin-transfected cells), paclitaxel significantly reduced the mean growth and shortening rates and lengths and dynamicity. In βIII-overexpressing cells, only the mean shortening rate and length were reduced, and these parameters were affected to a significantly lesser extent than in controls (Tables I and II and Fig. 3). Dynamicity is a calculated value representing the overall dynamic instability of a population of microtubules. In previous studies, dynamicity was reduced by 25–64% in conjunction with drug-induced inhibition of cell proliferation or mitotic arrest in A498, CaOV3, A549, and MCF7 cancer cell lines (6.Yvon A.-M. Wadsworth P. Jordan M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 947-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 12.Kamath K. Jordan M.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6026-6031PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Honore S. Kamath K. Braguer D. Horwitz S.B. Wilson L. Briand C. Jordan M.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4957-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, in βI-overexpressing CHO cells, dynamicity was reduced by 47%. However, in βIII-overexpressing paclitaxel-resistant cells, the dynamicity was reduced by only a statistically insignificant 12%. The lack of an effect of paclitaxel on dynamic instability in βIII-overexpressing cells is also consistent with the in vitro study of Derry et al. (28.Derry W.B. Wilson L. Khan I.A. Luduena R.F. Jordan M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3554-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), who found that microtubules composed exclusively of αβIII-tubulin were 7-fold less sensitive to suppression by paclitaxel than microtubules composed of αβII- or unfractionated tubulin. Thus, both in vitro and in living cells, increased levels of βIII-tubulin reduce the ability of paclitaxel to suppress microtubule dynamics. The possibility that the C-terminal HA tag on the transfected β-tubulin artifactually produced the observed results is highly unlikely. First, previous studies have shown that the presence of the HA tag does not affect microtubule assembly or endogenous MAP4 binding nor does it change the growth or drug resistance properties of the cells when compared with its transfected untagged β-tubulin counterpart (21.Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29.Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Second, the HA tag was present on both overexpressed isotypes. Finally, transfection of βIII-tubulin with or without the HA tag induced the same degree of paclitaxel resistance, indicating that the βIII-tubulin alone is responsible for resistance (21.Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Suppression of microtubule dynamics correlates with inhibition of proliferation and sensitivity to paclitaxel (2.Goncalves A. Braguer D. Kamath K. Martello L. Briand C. Horwitz S. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11737-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 6.Yvon A.-M. Wadsworth P. Jordan M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 947-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar); thus, the lack of suppression of microtubule dynamics is the most likely explanation for the resistance phenotype. Whether differential tubulin isotype expression has functional significance in cells has been a long-standing, unresolved question (30.Luduena R.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Results presented here indicate that β-tubulin isotypes could potentially play a role in the control of microtubule dynamics in cells by differentially interacting with endogenous microtubule regulatory proteins. Microtubule dynamics are exquisitely controlled in cells by a large number of proteins, including the specific plus-end and minus-end microtubule-binding proteins and those that bind along microtubule surfaces (1.Valiron O. Caudron N. Job D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2069-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31.Cassimeris L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is likely that many of the binding sites for drugs on microtubules are also binding sites for microtubule regulatory proteins. The microtubule-associated protein tau, for example, may bind to the same or an overlapping site on microtubules as paclitaxel (32.Kar S. Fan J. Smith M.J. Goedert M. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and, like paclitaxel, suppresses microtubule dynamic instability in cells (33.Bunker J.M. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus it is plausible that the tubulin isotype composition of microtubules may function to determine which regulatory proteins bind to and act on microtubules. What Is the Mechanism of βIII-Tubulin-mediated Paclitaxel Resistance?—Our results indicate that the weaker effect of paclitaxel on microtubules in βIII-tubulin-overexpressing cells is due to reduced drug binding or reduced drug efficacy (i.e. reduced ability of the drug to induce the conformational change required to suppress microtubule dynamics). Other microtubule-targeted drugs, including estramustine and colchicine, interact more weakly with βIII-tubulin than with several other isotypes in vitro (34.Banerjee A. Luduena R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2041-2047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Laing N. Dahllof B. Hartley-Asp B. Ranganathan S. Tew K.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, colchicine binding studies and cysteine cross-linking studies suggest that βIII-tubulin has a more rigid conformation than the other β-isotypes examined (18.Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytology. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Sharma J. Luduena R. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, microtubules composed largely of βIII-tubulin might resist the paclitaxel-induced conformational changes that suppress microtubule dynamic instability. Tubulin dimers are thought to undergo a conformational change upon addition to the microtubule end (15.Downing K. Nogales E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The rigidity of βIII-tubulin might also cause it to resist this conformational change, which may account for the reduced microtubule polymer in βIII-overexpressing cells. It is also conceivable that paclitaxel binding is prevented by a MAP with higher affinity for βIII-tubulin than the other isotypes. However, this possibility is less likely because the in vitro studies indicating altered interactions between paclitaxel and the β-tubulin isotypes were performed in the absence of MAPs (28.Derry W.B. Wilson L. Khan I.A. Luduena R.F. Jordan M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3554-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), suggesting a weaker or less efficacious interaction between paclitaxel and βIII-tubulin. One important question is how the levels of βIII-tubulin overexpression in the paclitaxel-resistant CHO cells used here (80% of total tubulin) (21.Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) relate to levels of isotype overexpression in cell lines and tumor samples that are resistant to paclitaxel. Quantitation of individual tubulin isotypes in cell lines and tissues is problematic, and adequate data are not available to answer this question. Early attempts to determine the relative abundance of tubulin isotypes in cells relied upon relative mRNA levels, which have since been shown to be poor indicators of tubulin expression (37.Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1720-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar, 38.Chen G. Gharib T. Huang C. Taylor J. Misek D. Kardia S. Giordano T. Iannettoni M. Orringer M. Hanash S. Beer D. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 304-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Current methods to quantitate β-tubulin isotypes in cells have generated different results depending upon the methodology (39.Dozier J. Hiser L. Davis J. Thomas N. Tucci M. Benghuzzi H. Frank-furter A. Correia J. Lobert S. Breast Cancer Res. 2003; 5: R157-R169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Verdier-Pinard P. Wang F. Martello L. Burd B. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In tumor samples, these studies are further complicated by the presence of normal cells as well as many other cell types (39.Dozier J. Hiser L. Davis J. Thomas N. Tucci M. Benghuzzi H. Frank-furter A. Correia J. Lobert S. Breast Cancer Res. 2003; 5: R157-R169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Development of more sophisticated methods to measure tubulin isotype expression will be necessary to understand what level of overexpression of βIII-tubulin significantly contributes to paclitaxel resistance. In addition, understanding how βIII-tubulin expression is regulated will be important in preventing or overcoming this type of drug resistance. In summary, we have shown directly in living human tumor cells that increasing the expression of βIII-tubulin can induce paclitaxel resistance by rendering microtubules relatively insensitive to the effects of paclitaxel. Clinical determination and regulation of βIII-tubulin expression levels in tumors may lead to significantly improved prediction of tumor response to paclitaxel and ultimately to overcoming one source of clinical resistance to paclitaxel.

In addition, obesity, in which circulating lipids are elevated, is associated with increased risk of various cancers. Relative to this point, we previously showed that oleate stimulates the proliferation of breast cancer cells and that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a role in this process. Nonetheless, questions remain regarding the precise mechanism(s) by which oleate promotes breast cancer cell growth. Pharmacological inhibitors of the GTP-binding proteins Gi/Go, phospholipase C, Src, and mitogenic-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK 1/2) decreased oleate-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. In addition, oleate caused a rapid and transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+ and an increase in protein kinase B phosphorylation. Overexpressing in these cells the G protein-coupled receptor GPR40, a fatty acid receptor, amplified oleate-induced proliferation, whereas silencing the GPR40 gene using RNA interference decreased it. Overexpressing GPR40 in T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells that are poorly responsive to oleate allowed a robust proliferative action of oleate. The data indicate that the phospholipase C, MEK 1/2, Src, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathways are implicated in the proliferative signal induced by oleate and that these effects are mediated at least in part via the G protein-coupled receptor GPR40. The results suggest that GPR40 is implicated in the control of breast cancer cell growth by fatty acids and that GPR40 may provide a link between fat and cancer.

The results suggest that GPR40 is implicated in the control of breast cancer cell growth by fatty acids and that GPR40 may provide a link between fat and cancer. Epidemiological and animal studies have revealed an association between dietary fatty acids and the incidence of breast cancer (1.Fay M.P. Freedman L.S. Clifford C.K. Midthune D.N.

Cancer. 2004; 4: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). However, relative little information exists on the mechanisms by which exogenous FFAs influence breast cancer cell growth. FFAs play pivotal roles in many biological processes. They serve as an abundant source of energy and as precursors of many cellular signaling and structural molecules (6.McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1371-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As natural ligands for the nuclear receptors peroxisomal proliferated-activated receptors (PPARs), they also control the transcription of several genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolisms (7.Ferre P. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 43-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, several biological effects appear to be PPAR independent (8.Sauer L.A. Dauchy R.T. Blask D.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5289-5295PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Louet J.F. Chatelain F. Decaux J.F. Park E.A. Kohl C. Pineau T. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the monounsaturated FFA oleate (C18:1) and the saturated FFA palmitate (C16:0), the two most abundant fatty acids in plasma, are not equivalent with respect to their actions on breast cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis (10.Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar). Oleate stimulates the proliferation of breast cancer cells, whereas palmitate induces apoptosis. Moreover, we found as a general principle that saturated FFAs (palmitic, myristic, and stearic) are proapoptotic, whereas unsaturated FFAs (oleic, linoleic, arachidonic, and eicosapentaenoic) increase proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (11.Hardy S. El-Assaad W. Przybytkowski E. Joly E. Prentki M. Langelier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31861-31870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition, a 1:10 molar ratio of oleate versus palmitate was sufficient to annihilate the proapoptotic action of palmitate (10.Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar). Important differences in the metabolism of these two FFAs in MDA-MB-231 cells contribute to their opposite effects on cell fate. An early enhancement of cardiolipin turnover and a decrease in the level of this mitochondrial phospholipid necessary for cytochrome c retention are involved in the proapoptotic effect of palmitate. By contrast oleate, by channeling palmitate to inert triglyceride stores and by permitting sustained cardiolipin synthesis, not only blocks palmitate-induced apoptosis but also permits cell proliferation (11.Hardy S. El-Assaad W. Przybytkowski E. Joly E. Prentki M. Langelier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31861-31870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition, oleate but not palmitate appears to act like a growth factor because it stimulates cell proliferation at very low concentrations and rapidly activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) in these cells (10.Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest the existence of signaling pathways via membrane receptors such as receptor tyrosine kinases or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), which are known to activate PI3-K (12.Grant S.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms by which oleate increases the proliferation of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. The results suggest that multiple pathways are involved in the proliferative action of oleate in these cells and that the oleate effect implicates a GPCR. In addition, evidence is provided that the oleate-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells is mediated at least in part through GPR40. Materials—Sodium salts of fatty acids were purchased from Nu-Check Prep (Elysian, MN). Fatty acid-free BSA (fraction V) was obtained from Sigma. Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). [3H]thymidine (specific activity, 71 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Lipofectamine 2000 and FuGENE 6 were purchased from Invitrogen and from Roche Applied Sciences, respectively. U73122, PD98059, PP1, LPA, H-89, wortmannin, protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) peptide inhibitor were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Pertussis toxin and AG1478 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture—The human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, T47D, and MCF-7 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in phenol red-free minimal essential medium containing non-essential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (standard medium). BSA-bound fatty acids were prepared by stirring fatty acid sodium salts (≥99% purity) at 37 °C with 5% fatty acid-free BSA as described before (25.Roche E. Buteau J. Aniento I. Reig J.A. Soria B. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2007-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After being adjusted to pH 7.4, the solution was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and the fatty acid concentration was measured using a NEFA C kit (GmbH; Wako Chemicals). When BSA-bound fatty acids were added to serum-free culture medium, the final concentration of BSA was adjusted to 0.5%. Cell Proliferation—For cell growth assay, 5000 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h in standard medium (10.Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar). After a 24-h starvation period in medium without serum, cells were incubated without or with BSA-bound fatty acids for 24 h. DNA synthesis was then assayed with a pulse of [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) during the last 4 h of the incubation. Cells were harvested with a PHD cell harvester from Cambridge Technology (Watertown, MA), and the radioactivity retained on the dried glass fiber filters was measured by liquid scintillation. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Analyses—For measuring EGFR activation, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (26.Buteau J. Foisy S. Joly E. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation analyses, cells were seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes at 2 × 105 cells/dish and incubated for 24 h in standard medium. After a 24-h period of serum starvation in medium containing 0.5% BSA, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mm glucose and 0.5% BSA for 2 h and stimulated with oleate or epidermal growth factor (EGF) for the indicated time. This incubation in Dulbecco's PBS was used to reduce basal levels of ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation. After stimulation, cells were washed and lysed in protein extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm NaPi, 1 mm NA3VO4, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad DC colorimetric assay. Equal amounts of protein (25 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using phospho(Thr-202/Tyr-204)-ERK1/2 (phosphorylated-ERK1/2), ERK1/2, phospho(Ser-473)-AKT (phosphorylated AKT), or AKT-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Cytosolic Calcium Determination—Cells grown in 150-mm Petri dishes (70% confluent) were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's PBS containing 5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2.5 mm probenecid, and 3 mm fura-2/AM. After 30 min of fura-2/AM loading at 25 °C, cells were washed and resuspended as above but without fura-2/AM and were dispensed at 2 × 105 cells/well into 96-well plates. [Ca2+]i was measured at 37 °C by the ratiometric method (emission fluorescence at 500 nm and excitation wavelengths at 340 and 380 nm) using a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies Inc., Durham, NC). Calcium concentrations were calculated as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (27.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cell Transfection—Cells seeded in 6-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well were incubated for 24 h in standard medium. Cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of the plasmid pIRESpuro-GPR40 expressing the human GPR40 (provided by Bjorn Olde, Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, Lund, Sweden) or a control plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase (CMV-RLuc) using Lipofectamine 2000 (MDA-MB-231) and FuGENE 6 (T47D and MCF-7) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five hours post-transfection, cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 5000 cells/well and assayed for cell growth as described above. RNA Interference—Vectors that express hairpin small interfering RNAs (siRNA) under the control of the human H1 promoter were constructed by inserting pairs of annealed DNA oligonucleotides into pSilencer H1 3.0 vector (Ambion, Austin, TX) between BamH1 and HindIII restriction sites according to the manufacturer's instructions. The target sequence for human GPR40 was 5′-AAGGGCATATTGCTTCAGTTC-3′. Cells were co-transfected with plasmid encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and siRNA targeting GPR40 gene or a scrambled siRNA control (Ambion). Cells expressing the GFP were enriched by selection on a fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FAC-Star Plus; BD Biosciences). Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 5000 cells/well and assayed for cell growth as described above. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene (Corbett Research, Sidney, Australia) using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used were as follows: GPR40 5′-AGCTCTCCTTCGGCCTCTATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGAGAGACTGTCAGCAGCAG-3′ (reverse), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGTCCACCACTGACACGTTG-3′ (reverse). Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between two conditions were assessed with a Student's t test for related samples. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Oleate-induced Cell Proliferation Does Not Involve EGFR Activation—We previously showed that the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate stimulates the proliferation of three different breast cancer cell lines and that PI3-K is implicated in this effect (10.Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A confirms this observation because the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin (28.Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) markedly curtailed oleate-induced proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, we showed that PI3-K is rapidly activated by oleate, suggesting signaling through a receptor (10.Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar). Because the EGFR has been reported to be activated by oleate in endothelial cells (14.Vacaresse N. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Auge N. Suc I. Frisach M.F. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we first examined whether the activation of the EGFR could be involved in oleate-induced proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. AG1478, a pharmacological inhibitor of EGFR activity (29.Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), did not significantly affect oleate-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1B). However, AG1478 efficiently prevented the phosphorylation of EGFR induced by EGF (Fig. 2A). In addition, an examination of the time course of EGFR phosphorylation induced by oleate revealed no activation of EGFR over 240 min of treatment (Fig. 2B). However, EGF induced a strong activation of the EGFR at 2 min that became maximal at 15 min and decreased thereafter. Interestingly, LPA transiently produced a modest increase in EGFR phosphorylation resulting probably from transactivation of the EGFR following LPA binding to its receptor (30.Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). These results establish that the EGFR is not implicated in oleate-induced proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells.Fig. 2EGFR is not activated by oleate in MDA-MB-231 cells. A, cells were stimulated with BSA alone (Cont), 0.1 mm oleate (Ole), or palmitate (Pal) bound to BSA (0.5%) or 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 min in the absence or presence of 250 nm AG1478. B, cells were stimulated with 0.1 mm oleate or 10 μm LPA bound to BSA or 100 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times. Cells were lysed, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated from total protein extracts to perform immunoblot analysis with an anti-phospho-tyrosine (p-Tyr)-specific antibody. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with an EGFR-specific antibody. The figure shows representative experiments that have been repeated twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oleate-induced MDA-MB-231 Cell Proliferation Is Decreased by Specific Inhibitors of Gi/Go, Phospholipase C, Src, MEK1/2, and PKCζ—Several fatty acid derivatives such as LPA are known to act via GPCRs and to activate PI3-K via G proteins (13.Yart A. Chap H. Raynal P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We first studied the effect of pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi/Go proteins (31.Moss J. Vaughan M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 303-379PubMed Google Scholar), on oleate-induced cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 1C, pertussis toxin decreased oleate-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation by 70%. The same extent of inhibition was observed with LPA, which has been shown to increase cell proliferation through GPCR activation via Gi/Go proteins (32.Fang X. Yu S. LaPushin R. Lu Y. Furui T. Penn L.Z. Stokoe D. Erickson J.R. Bast Jr., R.C. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This strongly supports that the effect of oleate on breast cancer cell proliferation is mediated at least in part by GPCR(s), because the action of pertussis toxin to inhibit Gi/Go is considered highly specific (31.Moss J. Vaughan M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 303-379PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation of GPCR caused the activation of a wide variety of signaling pathways, including modulation of phospholipases and protein kinases (20.Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To assess a possible role of these different signal transduction pathways in the action of oleate on breast cancer cell proliferation, we tested the effect of different classes of specific inhibitors. Treating cells with the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 (33.Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in an 80% reduction of oleate- or LPA-induced proliferation (Fig. 1D). PP1 and PD98059, which are pharmacological inhibitors of the Src-like family (34.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar) and of mitogenic-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) (35.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar), respectively, reduced the proliferative effect of oleate by about 40% (Fig. 1, E and F). Moreover, PKCζ, a downstream effector of PI3-K, appears also to be implicated in the proliferative effect of oleate because a specific membrane-permeant peptide inhibitor of PKCζ (36.Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31130-31137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) blocked the oleate-induced proliferation (Fig. 1G). However, this peptide inhibitor also decreased the proliferation in the control situation, suggesting that PKCζ is important for the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. Blocking protein kinase A, another downstream effector of GPCR, with H-89 (37.Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not affect oleate-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 1H). Taken together, the results are consistent with the view that oleate signals at least in part via GPCR(s) and that many downstream signal transduction pathways, including PLC, Src, MEK1/2, and PKCζ, may participate in its proliferative effect. Oleate Induces a Rapid Increase in AKT Phosphorylation— ERK1/2 and AKT, the direct downstream effectors of MEK1/2 and PI3-K, respectively, are major regulators of cell proliferation (38.Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the role of ERK1/2 and AKT in oleate-induced cell proliferation by using antibodies recognizing the activated/phosphorylated forms of Thr-202/Tyr-204-ERK1/2 and Ser-473-AKT. Because basal ERK1/2 activity is very high in MDA-MB-231 cells as previously described (39.Price J.T. Tiganis T. Agarwal A. Djakiew D. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5475-5478PubMed Google Scholar), we were unable to detect significant increases in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to either oleate or the usual positive control EGF (data not shown). In sharp contrast, both oleate and EGF stimulated AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). Oleate-induced AKT phosphorylation, which increased more than 2-fold during the first 5 min of treatment, peaked at 30 min and then slowly declined. The same extent of AKT activation was observed with five different preparations of oleate-BSA. In agreement with our previous data showing that oleate, but not palmitate, activates PI3-K (10.Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar), AKT phosphorylation was not induced by two different preparations of palmitate-BSA that had been shown to be active in inducing apoptosis (data not shown). Considering the PI3-K inhibitor data described in Fig. 1A, the results indicate that the proliferative signal induced by oleate is mediated at least in part via PI3-K/AKT activation. Oleate Increases [Ca2+]i in the Presence and Absence of BSA—GPR40 was first recognized to be activated by medium and long chain FFA (not bound to BSA) by assays measuring [Ca2+]i in GPR40-overexpressing cells (21.Itoh Y.

https://openalex.org/W1991948582,"More than 125 genes that regulate pigmentation have been identified to date. Of those, MART-1 has been widely studied as a melanoma-specific antigen and as a melanosome-specific marker. Whereas the functions of other melanosomal proteins, such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1, dopachrome tautomerase, and Pmel17, are known, the function of MART-1 in melanogenesis, is unclear. A role for MART-1 in pigmentation is expected because its expression pattern and subcellular distribution is quite similar to the other melanosomal proteins and usually correlates with melanin content. We investigated the function of MART-1 using a multidisciplinary approach, including the use of siRNA to inhibit MART-1 function and the use of transfection to re-express MART-1 in MART-1-negative cells. We show that MART-1 forms a complex with Pmel17 and affects its expression, stability, trafficking, and the processing which is required for melanosome structure and maturation.

We conclude that MART-1 is indispensable for Pmel17 function and thus plays an important role in regulating mammalian pigmentation. Melanosomes are lysosome-related organelles which have the unique capacity to produce melanin pigment (1.Orlow S.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and which progress through four sequential morphological steps as they mature (2.Seiji M. Fitzpatrick T.B. Simpson R.T. Birbeck M.S.C. Nature. 1963; 197: 1082-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Stage I melanosomes are round, membrane-bound and electron-lucent vesicles that are generally found in the perinuclear area. The transition to Stage II melanosomes involves an elongation of the vesicle, and the appearance within of distinct fibrillar structures. The production of those internal matrix fibers and the maturation from Stages I to II melanosomes depend on the presence of a structural protein termed Pmel17, also known as gp100 or SILV. Shortly after its delivery to Stage I melanosomes, Pmel17 is cleaved into several fragments, which form the fibrillar matrix of the organelle (3.Berson J.F. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S.

In pigmented cells, melanins are deposited on these fibers, resulting in a progressively pigmented internal matrix, at which time the organelles are termed Stage III melanosomes. In highly pigmented tissues, melanin synthesis and deposition continue until little or no internal structure is visible, at which time they are termed Stage IV melanosomes. More than 125 pigmentation-related genes have been identified to date (7.Bennett D.C. Lamoreux M.L. Pigment Cell Res. 2003; 16: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).

MART-1 was initially cloned by two independent groups using melanoma reactive CD8+ T cells (8.Coulie P.G. Brichard V. Van Pel A. Wolfel T. Schneider J. Traversari C. Mattei S. De Plaen E. Lurquin C.

MART-1 is a type III membrane protein (with an apparent molecular mass of 22-24 kDa) localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and in melanosomes (10.Kawakami Y.

MART-1 does not contain consensus signals for N-linked glycosylation sites or for N-terminal signal peptides, which TYR, TYRP1, DCT, and Pmel17 possess. Although MART-1 has no apparent homology to other known melanosomal proteins and no detectable enzymatic activity, MART-1 is highly enriched in early melanosomes (Stage I and/or II melanosomes) (5.Kushimoto T.

Pmel17 is the human homologue of murine silver, whose disruption of function produces a silver hair color in mice (13.Kwon B.S. Halaban R. Ponnazhagan S. Kim K. Chintamaneni C.D. Bennett D.C. Pickard R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Pmel17 was also cloned initially as a melanoma specific antigen recognized by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (14.Bakker A.B.H. Schreurs M.W.J. de Boer A.J. Kawakami Y. Rosenberg S.A. Adema G.J. Figdor C.G. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Both MART-1 and Pmel17 serve as common targets for tumor-directed T lymphocytes; both are often highly expressed in melanoma cells and have been widely studied as targets of immunotherapy for melanoma (15.Kawakami Y. Robbins P.F. Wang R.F. Parkhurst M.R. Kang X. Rosenberg S.A. J. Immunother. 1998; 21: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, despite intensive efforts, the role of MART-1 in melanocytes, and perhaps in melanogenesis, has remained unknown, and the phenotype caused by the loss of MART-1 function is undefined. In this study, we assessed the role of MART-1 in human melanocytic cells, including normal human melanocytes and human melanoma cells. We used siRNA technology as well as transfection of MART-1 into MART-1-negative melanoma cells to characterize the function of MART-1. We show that MART-1 plays a vital role in the expression, stability, trafficking, and processing of Pmel17, which is critical to the formation of Stage II melanosomes. This study also provides important clues toward understanding the synergistic effects of melanosome-associated proteins and the role of MART-1 in pigmentation. Cell Cultures—MNT-1 cells and SK-MEL-28 cells were used as described previously (16.Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Mizoguchi M. Appella E. Hearing V.J.

Primary normal human melanocytes, a kind gift from Dr. Zalfa A. Abdel-Malek (University of Cincinnati) were cultured in melanocyte basal medium with growth supplements (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR). At least three independent strains of melanocytes were used in each experiment reported in this study. Plasmid Construction and Transfection—We reverse-transcribed total RNA from MNT-1 cells using a cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). cDNA was amplified with PCR cloning enzyme (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using MART-1-specific primers. Products were ligated into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Pmel17 vector was constructed by ligating an EcoRI/XbaI DNA fragment from hugp100 (hugp100 was kindly provided by Dr. Nicholas Restifo at the NCI, National Institutes of Health) into pcDNA3.1 vector (17.Rakhmilevich A.L. Imboden M. Hao Z. Macklin M.D. Roberts T. Wright K.M. Albertini M.R. Yang N.S. Sondel P.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 952-961PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. As a negative control vector, the pcDNA3.1 vector with no insertion was used. For transfection, cells were plated 1 day in advance and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA Studies—MART-1 siRNA was synthesized using the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The following DNA template and its complementary antisense sequence were used to make double-stranded MART-1 siRNA: aagacgaaatggatacagagc and its complementary sequence. For a negative control, we used aagaggaaaagcaaagtctcg and its complementary sequence. They were reverse-transcribed and annealed into siRNAs. Transfection was performed with the siRNA transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (2.0 μg/ml siRNA was used unless noted). We confirmed that these siRNAs did not share at least 21-bp successive sequences with any human Pmel17 mRNA sequence, which had ever been published. Semiquantitative RT-PCR Analysis—We reverse-transcribed total RNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). PCR reactions consisted of 35 cycles for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (18.Hoashi T. Kadono T. Kikuchi K. Etoh T. Tamaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Pmel17, and 40 cycles for MART-1 using Ex-TaqHS (Takara). PCR products for GAPDH, MART-1 and Pmel17 were 450, 300, and 700 bp, respectively, and were electrophoresed in parallel with DNA molecular mass marks (Invitrogen). Each PCR product was also electrophoresed with a reaction after five additional cycles and was confirmed to be within the exponential amplifying state (data not shown). Target gene transcripts relative to GAPDH were quantified by Scion Image software (Scion, Frederick, MD). Each experiment was repeated three times. Primer sequences are available upon request. Antibodies and Reagents—αPEP1h, αPEP7h, αPEP8h, and αPEP13h antibodies were generated in rabbits against synthetic peptides corresponding to the C termini of human TYRP1, TYR, DCT, and Pmel17, respectively (6.Yasumoto K.

M2-9E3 and M2-7C10 for MART-1 (Neo Markers, Fremont, CA), A103 for MART-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HMB45 for the processed internal domain of Pmel17 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), HMB50 for full-length Pmel17 (Neo Markers), anti-KDEL (Stressgen, San Diego, CA), anti-LAMP-2 (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ), anti-Bip/GRP78, anti-Vti1b (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and anti-β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) were used. For immunopurification, a mixture of M2-9E3, M2-7C10 and A103 was used. M2-9E3 was used for other applications. BFA was purchased from Sigma. MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. Subcellular Fractionation—For purification of melanosomes, ER, and Golgi apparatus, we used the protocols previously described (16.Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Mizoguchi M. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7971-7981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were plated in 2-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) and incubated at 37 °C and were stained by double or triple indirect immunofluorescence methods. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. After three further washes in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were permeabilized with 100% methanol for 15 min at 4 °C and were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated with a mixture containing a polyclonal and/or monoclonal antibodies (at the dilution noted in the figure legends) overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, the polyclonal antibodies were reacted with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400) labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and the monoclonal antibodies were reacted with goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200), IgG1 (1:200), IgG2a (1:200), and/or IgG2b (1: 200) labeled with Alexa Fluor 488, 594, or 647 (Molecular Probes). Then, the cells were counterstained with DAPI (Vector, Burlingame, CA). The reactivities of Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 were visualized as green and red signal, respectively. They were classified into three categories, according to whether they showed green, red, or yellow signals. The latter was indicative of colocalization of the red and green signals. The reactivities of Alexa Fluor 647 and DAPI are visualized as violet and blue, respectively. All preparations were examined with a confocal microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss, Germany), equipped with HeNe (543 nm and 633 nm), argon, and krypton laser sources. Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was performed as previously described (16.Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Mizoguchi M. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7971-7981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thin sections were examined using a Zeiss EM 912 Omega electron microscope. Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting—Cell extracts were prepared, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (6.Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28330-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Radioactive metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (6.Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28330-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were starved in the Met/Cys-free medium for 30 min and were then pulsed for 30 min with [35S]Met/Cys (Amersham Biosciences). They were chased for specific periods (as detailed in the figure legends) in medium containing 1 mm cold methionine, and then were solubilized in immunoprecipitate lysis buffer (6.Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28330-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). If indicated, MG132 and BFA were added from the “starvation” and “pulse” periods, respectively, to the “chase” period. Cell extracts were incubated with normal rabbit serum (NRS; Vector) and were then incubated with protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences). The supernatants were incubated with αPEP13h. The immune-complexes were separated by incubation with beads and were further washed with immunoprecipitate lysis buffer. The final pellets were eluted, electrophoresed, and visualized by autoradiography. For cold immunoprecipitation, samples were dissolved in immunoprecipitate lysis buffer and were then incubated with appropriate controls or antibodies as detailed in the figure legends. The immunocomplexes were separated by incubation with beads and were further washed. Immunoblotting was then performed as described above. Sequential immunoprecipitation was described previously with some modifications (21.Toyofuku K. Wada I. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Ferrans V.J. Hearing V.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The duration of the “starvation” and the “pulse” was 30 min each. After 0 or 45 min of chase, cells were solubilized in immunoprecipitate lysis buffer. Samples were incubated with normal mouse IgG (Vector), and then were further incubated with beads. The supernatants were incubated with MART-1 antibodies or with normal mouse IgG and then were further incubated with beads. After washing, immune complexes were eluted with elution buffer (22.Toyofuku K. Wada I. Spritz R.A. Hearing V.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with NRS then were further incubated with beads to eliminate nonspecific binding and excess antibodies. Supernatants were used for the second immunoprecipitation with the same procedure as described above. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.D. Student's t test was used. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Expression of Melanosomal Proteins in Various Types of Melanocytic Cells—To elucidate the function of MART-1, we screened a number of melanocytic cell lines to find one that does not express MART-1 but does express other melanosomal proteins. Unpigmented WM266-4 human melanoma cells have been reported to have undetectable levels of MART-1 (10.Kawakami Y. Battles J.K. Kobayashi T. Wang X. Tupesis J.L. Marincola F.M. Robbins P.F. Hearing V.J. Gonda M.A. Rosenberg S.A. J. Immunol. Meth. 1997; 202: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As MART-1-positive controls, we used pigmented MNT-1 melanoma cells, unpigmented SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells and normal human melanocytes. We then characterized the expression of various other melanosomal proteins, including TYR, TYRP1, DCT, and Pmel17, in those four types of cells; all four types of cells expressed TYR, DCT, and Pmel17 (as recognized by the αPEP13h antibody, which is specific for the carboxyl tail of the protein) (Fig. 1A). SK-MEL-28 cells and WM266-4 cells, both of which are unpigmented, were negative for TYRP1. WM266-4 cells expressed negligible levels of MART-1, as previously reported (10.Kawakami Y. Battles J.K. Kobayashi T. Wang X. Tupesis J.L. Marincola F.M. Robbins P.F. Hearing V.J. Gonda M.A. Rosenberg S.A. J. Immunol. Meth. 1997; 202: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); however, the other three types of cells strongly expressed MART-1, also as reported previously (16.Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Mizoguchi M. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7971-7981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The processed and cleaved forms of Pmel17, termed P100 (∼100 kDa) and P26 (∼26 kDa) were detected by αPEP13h, which recognizes the C terminus of Pmel17 in all four types of cells, although with different relative band intensities (Fig. 1A). The P100 form has been termed P1 or the full-length form while the P26 form has also been termed as Mβ (3.Berson J.F. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3451-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 6.Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28330-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); the epitopes of the different antibodies to Pmel17 are depicted in Fig. 1B. A ∼75-kDa band (P75) was clearly detected by α-PEP13h in melanocytes and in MNT-1 cells, and that band represents the nascent form of Pmel17 (6.Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28330-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, WM266-4 cells expressed the P100 and P26 forms of Pmel17 much weaker than did the other types of cells. It should be noted that αPEP13h reacts well with Pmel17 in Stage I melanosomes or in the ER but very poorly with Stage II melanosomes (5.Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Matsunaga J. Vieira W.D. Muller J. Appella E. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10698-10703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In contrast, HMB45 reacts specifically with the cleaved internal domain of Pmel17 (which is found only in Stages II-IV melanosomes), but does not react with the intact Pmel17 found in Stage I melanosomes (5.Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Matsunaga J. Vieira W.D. Muller J. Appella E. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10698-10703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 6.Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28330-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); HMB45 thus serves as a specific marker for fibrillar melanosomes (Stages II-IV). The reactivity of HMB45 consists mainly of a ∼35-kDa band and several larger diffuse bands (6.Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28330-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, WM266-4 cells did not express the processed form of Pmel17 that is recognized by HMB45, although the other cells were strongly positive for that epitope (Fig. 1A). We confirmed that WM266-4 cells express MART-1 and Pmel17 mRNAs and that there are no mutations in those genes, at least in their coding regions, compared with published cDNA sequences (data not shown). We previously established a subcellular fractionation technique using a stepwise sucrose density gradient to purify melanosomes at various stages from MNT-1 cells (5.Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Matsunaga J. Vieira W.D. Muller J. Appella E. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10698-10703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and from SK-MEL-28 cells (16.Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Mizoguchi M. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7971-7981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In pigmented MNT-1 cells, the 0.8-1.2 m and the 1.6-1.8 m sucrose fractions contain Stage I-II and Stage III-IV melanosomes, respectively (5.Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Matsunaga J. Vieira W.D. Muller J. Appella E. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10698-10703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23.Kushimoto T. Valencia J.C. Costin G.E. Toyofuku K. Watabe H. Yasumoto K. Rouzaud F. Vieira W.D. Hearing V.J. Pigment Cell Res. 2003; 16: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, in unpigmented SK-MEL-28 cells, the 0.8 m and the 1.4-1.8 m sucrose fractions contain Stage I and II melanosomes, respectively (16.Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Mizoguchi M. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7971-7981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As expected from the results above, neither MART-1 nor Pmel17 (recognized by HMB45; data not shown) was detected in any of those fractions from WM266-4 cells, including the ER- and the Golgi-enriched fractions (Fig. 1C). The enrichment of the ER and Golgi fractions was demonstrated by reactivities of those fractions to the organelle markers Bip/GRP78 and Vti1b, respectively. To validate the identity of those melanosome fractions, we detected TYR by immunoblotting, which is readily detectable in early melanosomes (16.Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Mizoguchi M. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7971-7981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23.Kushimoto T.

In WM266-4 cells, TYR was strongly detected in the 0.8-1.8 m sucrose fractions and in the ER (Fig. 1C). This reactivity pattern indicates that TYR trafficking is not significantly disrupted in WM266-4 cells. The P100 and P26 forms of Pmel17 were detected in the ER and in the 1.0-1.8 m sucrose fractions of WM266-4 cells, and the distribution was very similar to that of TYR. Diffuse, smeared bands detected by αPEP13h were also observed in the 0.8-1.0 m sucrose fractions, which was likely due to degradation of Pmel17. There were no Stage II melanosomes (or even fibrils within vesicles) visible in the 1.0 or 1.8 m sucrose fractions by electron microscopy (Fig. 1D). Thus, Pmel17 processing to the HMB45 reactive form is disrupted in WM266-4 cells since staining with HMB45 was always negative (Fig. 1A and other data not shown). Taken together, the patterns of expression of MART-1 and Pmel17 (recognized by HMB45) differed between WM266-4 cells and the other melanocytic cells. WM266-4 cells did not express detectable levels of MART-1 or Pmel17 (recognized by HMB45) in any sucrose fraction or in the cell lysate, although TYR and Pmel17 (recognized by αPEP13h) were readily detected. Those results indicate that the 1.0-1.8 m sucrose fractions in WM266-4 cells contain Stage I melanosomes. Processing and Stability of Pmel17 in WM266-4 Cells—To characterize the processing of Pmel17 and to determine its stability in WM266-4 cells, we used pulse-chase metabolic labeling with αPEP13h (Fig. 1E). As a control, we used SK-MEL-28 cells, because they express other melanosomal proteins (TYR, DCT, and Pmel17) similar to WM266-4 cells and contain Stage II melanosomes (16.Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Kushimoto T. Ando H. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Mizoguchi M. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7971-7981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Pmel17 has been shown to be synthesized and glycosylated rapidly, then cleaved to the P26 form in MNT-1 cells (4.Berson J.F. Theos A.C. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6.Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28330-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and we confirmed that in SK-MEL-28 cells. The P120 form, which represents fully glycosylated Pmel17 and has also been reported as P2 (3.Berson J.F. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3451-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), was detected between at 15 min to 1 h in both types of cells. Interestingly, a band noted as P75′ (∼75 kDa) appeared after 30 min in SK-MEL-28 cells and it was even more apparent in WM266-4 cells. However, the P75′ band is not identical to the P75 band because P75 was not observed in SK-MEL-28 cells or in WM266-4 cells (Fig. 1A) and because P75′ was not observed in MNT-1 cells (data not shown). Degradation of P100 was quicker (nearly undetectable at 3 h) in WM266-4 cells in contrast with SK-MEL-28 cells. P26 was similarly detectable at 30 min to 1 h and was undetectable at 3 h in WM266-4 cells, kinetics that were quite similar to SK-MEL-28 cells. From these results, we conclude that the processing of Pmel17 to the P26 form is quite similar in both types of cells but that the stability of Pmel17 is significantly decreased in WM266-4 cells compared with SK-MEL-28 cells (lower panel in Fig. 1E), which suggests that MART-1 may play a role in the structure and/or function of Pmel17. MART-1 and Pmel17 Form Complexes in Melanocytic Cells— To examine the possible interactions of MART-1 and Pmel17, we next immunopurified Pmel17 with αPEP13h, and then used an antibody to MART-1 in an immunoblotting assay to see if Pmel17 and MART-1 h"
https://openalex.org/W2134051610,"The hypothesis that neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) may interact with heparin-binding proteins other than vascular endothelial growth factor has been tested using an optical biosensor-based binding assay. The results show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1, 2, 4, and 7, FGF receptor 1, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), FGF-binding protein, normal protease sensitive form of prion protein, antithrombin III, and Npn-1 itself are all able to interact with Npn-1 immobilized on the sensor surface. FGF-2, FGF-4, and HGF/SF are also shown to interact with Npn-1 in a solution assay. Moreover, these protein-protein interactions are dependent on the ionic strength of the medium and are inhibited by heparin, and the kinetics of binding of FGF-2, FGF-4 and HGF/SF to Npn-1 are characterized by fast association rate constants (270,000–1,600,000 m–1 s–1). These results suggest that Npn-1 possesses a “heparin” mimetic site that is able to interact at least in part through ionic bonding with the heparin binding site on many of the proteins studied. Npn-1 was also found to potentiate the growth stimulatory activity of FGF-2 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells, indicating that Npn-1 may not just bind but also regulate the activity of heparin-binding proteins.

Cohen T. Shraga N. Lange T. Kessler O. Herzog Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Signal transduction requires the formation of a functional semaphorin-3A-Npn-1-plexin complex (2.Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M.

Npn-1 has also been reported to form stable complexes with the L1-CAM adhesion molecule, modulating the axon repellent effect of semaphorin-3A (1.Neufeld G. Cohen T. Shraga N. Lange T. Kessler O.

It has since become apparent that Npn-1 interacts with other partners and has substantial biological functions outside the nervous system. Thus, Npn-1 is also a receptor for a heparin binding isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF165 (6.Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M.

The presence of Npn-1 apparently enhances the interaction of VEGF165 with its VEGFR2 signaling receptor and potentiates both VEGF-stimulated mitogenesis and chemotaxis in cultured endothelial cells. However, it is not yet clear whether Npn-1 forms complexes directly with VEGFR2 or through the VEGF ligand (7.Soker S. Miao H.Q. Nomi M. Takashima S. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 8.Whitaker G.B. Limberg B.J. Rosenbaum J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25520-25531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), although it was recently reported that Npn-1 does form complexes directly with VEGFR1/Flt-1 (9.Gluzman-Poltorak Z.

Moreover, studies with monomeric and dimeric forms of soluble Npn-1 suggest that only the dimeric form can deliver VEGF165 efficiently to the VEGFR2 receptor (11.Yamada Y. Takakura N. Yasue H. Ogawa H. Fujisawa H. Suda T. Blood. 2001; 97: 1671-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and so the dimer may represent the agonist form of the molecule, the monomer acting as an antagonist. Considerable data support a functional role for Npn-1 in regulating VEGF activities on endothelium. Studies with cultured endothelial cells have shown that semaphorin-3A can compete with VEGF165 binding to Npn-1 and inhibit angiogenesis in vitro (12.Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Recently, a truncated form of Npn-1 mRNA encoding a soluble form of Npn-1 (sNpn-1) was identified in prostate carcinoma cells, heart, liver, kidney, skin, and placenta (6.Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar, 13.Gagnon M.L. Bielenberg D.R. Gechtman Z. Miao H.Q. Takashima S. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In situ analysis of Npn-1 expression associated with blood vessels showed that only full-length Npn-1, and not sNpn-1, is expressed. Overexpression of sNpn-1 by prostate carcinoma cells inhibited tumor growth and reduced both the number and integrity of tumor blood vessels, suggesting that sNpn-1 inhibits VEGF165 binding to Npn-1 or VEGFR2. This is supported by the recent finding that soluble monomeric Npn-1 suppressed angiogenesis in vitro (11.Yamada Y. Takakura N. Yasue H. Ogawa H. Fujisawa H. Suda T. Blood. 2001; 97: 1671-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Npn-1 knock-out mice die at mid-gestation and, in addition to neural defects, exhibit transposition of large vessels, disorganized and insufficient capillary formation, and defects in heart development (14.Kawasaki T. Kitsukawa T. Bekku Y. Matsuda Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Development. 1999; 126: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of Npn-1 leads to over stimulation of blood vessel formation (15.Kitsukawa T. Shimono A. Kawakami A. Kondoh H. Fujisawa H. Development. 1995; 121: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These in vivo studies suggest that Npn-1 expression is critical to normal vessel development, tumor, and wound angiogenesis (13.Gagnon M.L. Bielenberg D.R. Gechtman Z. Miao H.Q. Takashima S. Soker S.

Npn-1 has also been shown to bind two other VEGF family members, VEGFB and placenta growth factor (17.Makinen T. Olofsson B. Karpanen T. Hellman U. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Eriksson U. Alitalo K. J.

Savory L.J. Fleming S.B. Caesar C. Vitali A. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3071-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All of these VEGF-related proteins also bind heparin. However, Npn-1 does not bind to VEGF121, the VEGF isoform that lacks the heparin binding site encoded by exon 7 (6.Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these results is that the site on Npn-1, which has been identified as responsible for interacting with heparin-binding VEGF family members, may represent a heparin mimic, which might act as a receptor organizing scaffold. Such a site would be relatively promiscuous and interact with heparin-binding proteins outside the VEGF family. We have tested this idea with a quantitative optical biosensor-based binding assay. The results show that Npn-1 interacts with a subset of the heparin-binding proteins tested, notably, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1, FGF-2, FGF-4, FGF-7, FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1), and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). In support of the idea that these interactions are due to a heparin mimetic site on Npn-1, they depend on ionic strength and are competed by heparin. Because Npn-1 potentiated the growth stimulatory activity of FGF-2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), the possibility is raised that Npn-1 may have a broad modulatory activity on a subset of growth factors, morphogens. and other heparin-binding proteins.

Carrier-free recombinant human FGF-4, HGF/SF, tumor necrosis factor α, VEGF165, rat Npn-1 (as an Fc fusion protein), the Fc protein, and a polyclonal anti-serum to FGF-2 were purchased from R&D systems (Abingdon, UK). Antithrombin III, protein G-Sepharose, and porcine intestinal mucosa heparin (15–20 kDa) were from Sigma. Heparin-derived hexasaccharides were prepared from partial heparinase I digests of pig mucosal heparin and were obtained from Iduron (Manchester, UK). HUVEC, large vessel endothelial basal medium, large vessel medium supplement, and gentamycin/amphotericin supplement (1000× concentrate) were purchased from TCS CellWorks (Buckingham, UK). Dialyzed fetal calf serum was prepared by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 5 × 10 volumes over 48 h, at 4 °C, and filter-sterilized. Immunoprecipitation—One μg of Npn-1 was incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose in 1 ml of 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8. At lower concentrations of NaCl, the Npn-1 self-associated, which prevented the efficient interaction of the Fc fusion protein with the protein G (result not shown). After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant (S1) was collected, and protein was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of PBS and incubated for 3 h at room temperature with growth factor (500 ng FGF-2 and FGF-4, 1.5 μg HGF/SF) in 250 μl of PBS. The sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant (S2) was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the pellet was washed with 1 ml of PBS. Supernatants S1 and S2 and the final pellet were adjusted in volume, and polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver nitrate staining or Western blot using a rabbit antibody to FGF-2 (26.Delehedde M.

Binding Assays—Npn-1 was immobilized on aminosilane surfaces using bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS3; Perbio, Chester, UK) as the cross-linker following the manufacturer's recommendations (Thermo electron, Basingstoke, UK). To ensure low coverage by the immobilized ligand and prevent self-association of Npn-1 (Table I, Fig. 1) from blocking binding sites, a low concentration of Npn-1 (≤1 μg/ml) was added to the BS3-activated surface, and no more than 200 arc s Npn-1 was immobilized on the surface (600 arc s = 1 ng of protein/mm2). Because this self-association reaction was inhibited by high concentrations of NaCl, in some experiments Npn-1 was immobilized (again no more than 200 arc s) in 2 m NaCl buffered with 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2. Binding assays were carried out in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2) supplemented with 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) at 20 °C following previously described methods (26.Delehedde M. Lyon M.

A single binding assay consisted of adding the soluble binding partner or ligate in 5 μl of PBST to a cuvette containing 25 or 45 μl of PBST. The association reaction was followed over a set time, usually 180 s, by which time binding was within 90% of the maximum. The cuvette was then washed 3 times with 50 μl of PBST to initiate the dissociation of bound ligate. The Npn-1-derivatized surface was regenerated by washing twice with 50 μl of 2 m NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 20 mm HCl, which removed 98–100% of bound ligate. Binding parameters were calculated from the association and dissociation phases of the binding reactions using the non-linear curve fitting FAST-fit (Thermo Electron).Table IThickness and density of Npn-1 immobilized on aminosilane surfacesNpn-1ThicknessaThickness of the Npn-1 immobilized on the sensor surface.

In competitive binding assays, 5 μl of PBST-containing polysaccharide was added to a Npn-1 derivatized cuvette containing 40 μlof PBST. Ligate was then added, and the association reaction was followed for 210 s. Data Analysis—The determination of binding kinetics in optical biosensors can be prone to artifactual second phase binding sites, due either to rates of diffusion of soluble ligate approaching or exceeding the rate of association or to steric hindrance at the binding surface (29.Fernig D.G. Iozzo R.V. Proteoglycan Protocols. 171. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 505-518Google Scholar). Binding assays were designed to avoid such artifacts (26.Delehedde M. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 235-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Delehedde M. Lyon M. Vidyasagar R. McDonnell T.J. Fernig D.G. J. Biol.

Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 505-518Google Scholar). Thus, kon was only determined at low concentrations of ligate, whereas koff was measured at higher concentrations of ligate to avoid steric hindrance and rebinding artifacts, respectively. Competing soluble Npn-1 could not be added to the dissociation buffer to avoid rebinding artifacts (29.Fernig D.G. Iozzo R.V. Proteoglycan Protocols. 171. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 505-518Google Scholar), since it was found to interact with the immobilized Npn-1 in a self-association reaction (Fig. 1). A single site binding model fitted the association and the dissociation data at least as well as a two-site binding model in both the competitive binding assays and the kinetic experiments. Therefore, the binding reaction between the ligates and immobilized Npn-1 was deemed to be monophasic, and a single site model was used to calculate all binding parameters. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated both from the ratio of the kd and ka and from the extent of binding to provide an estimate of the self-consistency of the results. Dual Polarization Interferometry—An Analight Bio200 (Farfield Sensors, Salford, UK) was used to probe the Npn-1 immobilized on amine surfaces, since unlike first generation optical biosensors, this instrument measures absolute changes in refractive index and so determines quantitatively the amount of adsorbate (30.Cross G.H. Reeves A.A. Brand S. Popplewell J.F. Peel L.L. Swann M.J. Freeman N.J. Biosens. Bioelectronics. 2003; 19: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 31.Swann M.J. Peel L.L. Carrington S. Freeman N.J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). An aminosilane chip (Farfield Sensors) was calibrated by injecting a solution of 80% ethanol, 20% H2O (both w/w) twice over the chip surface followed by an injection of H2O. BS3 was used to cross-link Npn-1 to the amine surface; BS3 was injected onto both channels on the chip surface at a concentration of 10 mm twice for 3 min per injection followed by a brief wash with PBS at a flow rate of 50 μl min–1. Npn-1 (3.3 μgm/l) was loaded in 2 m NaCl to prevent self-association onto channel 1, and a high concentration of neuropilin, 33 μg/ml, was loaded in PBS onto channel 3. Contact time for the reaction with BS3 was 15 min. Unreacted BS3 was then blocked with Tris-HCl (1 m, pH 8.0) followed by a wash with 20 mm HCl to remove non-covalently adsorbed Npn-1. Heparin (10 μg/ml) and FGF-2 (3.3 μg/ml) were injected in PBS at a flow rate of 50 μl min–1 per channel for 3 min. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Npn-1 (200 μl) was applied to a 150-ml column of Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) on an ACTA Purifier 10 (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.5 ml/min. Npn-1 was injected at concentrations of 3.33 μg/ml in PBS with PBS as the mobile phase and of 10 μg/ml in 2 m NaCl buffered with 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, with 2 m NaCl in the same buffer as the mobile phase. A greater concentration of Npn-1 was in the buffer containing 2 m NaCl to compensate for the increased background absorbance from the NaCl. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad) were used under the same conditions to assess the hydrodynamic volume of the eluted peaks. HUVEC DNA Synthesis Assays—HUVEC were routinely cultured in complete large vessel endothelial medium (TCS CellWorks) containing 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, as recommended by the manufacturer, and in humidified 5% CO2, air. Cells were passaged just before confluence using a 1:3 split and used at passage 3. For the determination of the effect of FGF-2 and Npn-1 on growth, cells were suspended in complete medium and plated into a 96-well tissue culture plate (Corning Costar, Sigma) at 104 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were then washed 3 times with sterile PBS over a period of 10 min and then incubated in large vessel basal medium (100 μl) for 2 h. This was then replaced with 100 μl of basal medium containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum, gentamycin/amphotericin supplement, and FGF-2 and Npn-1, as indicated in the figure legend. After a further 48 h of incubation, 10 μl of 100 μm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine was added to each well, and the plate was reincubated for a further 3 h. Incorporated 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine was then measured using a colorimetric immunoassay kit (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions. Characterization of Npn-1 in Solution—To identify the monomeric and oligomeric species of Npn-1 in solution under the conditions used for immobilization on biosensor surfaces, Npn-1 was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography in different concentrations of NaCl. Npn-1 chromatographed as two peaks, the first corresponding to a hydrodynamic size equivalent to thyroglobulin (670 kDa) and a second corresponding to bovine γ globulin (158 kDa). These presumably represent an oligomeric species and a single Npn-1 Fc fusion protein, respectively. When 3.33 μg/ml Npn-1 was applied in PBS, 62% of the protein eluted in the first peak and 38% in the second peak. However, in 2 m NaCl (10 μg/ml Npn-1), just 7% of the Npn-1 eluted as the larger species, and 93% eluted as the smaller species. These results support the notion that Npn-1 undergoes a NaCl-dependent self-association and show that in PBS at 3.3 μg/ml, 38% of the Npn-1 is likely to be in the form of a single Fc fusion protein. Characterization of Npn-1 of Surfaces and Immobilized Npn-1—Preliminary results in the IAsys biosensor showed that if the concentration of Npn-1 used to derivatize the surface was 13.3 μg/ml in PBS the amount of immobilized Npn-1 (>600 arc s) was far greater than warranted by simple mass action (1 mg/ml protein required to immobilize ∼600 arc s). Such a high level of immobilization of Npn-1 was presumably due to the self-association of the Npn-1 (Fig. 1). A dual polarization interferometer was used to obtain information regarding the density of Npn-1 immobilized on aminosilane surfaces and the ability of the immobilized Npn-1 to bind heparin. The addition of 33 μg/ml Npn-1 to a BS3-activated aminosilane surface resulted in the immobilization of 5.19 ng of protein/mm2 of sensor surface with a thickness of 4.8 nm (Table I). Although the structure of Npn-1 is not known, given the modular form of the protein and the presence of a C-terminal Fc fusion, the thickness of the immobilized protein suggests an asymmetric shape in which the longer sides are parallel to the surface and the shorter side (4.8 nm) is normal to the sensor surface. The theoretical maximum coverage for Npn-1 oriented in this way is 7.5 ng of protein/mm2 of sensor surface. Therefore, the immobilized Npn-1 is close to a monolayer. The dual polarization interferometer readily measures the binding of polysaccharides as well as proteins, but on the surface with a high density of Npn-1, specific binding of heparin (10 μg/ml) could not be detected (result not shown). Moreover, in both the IAsys and the dual polarization interferometer, Npn-1 immobilized at these high densities did not bind FGF-2 (result not shown). In the IAsys biosensor the level of immobilized Npn-1 matched that expected from simple mass action (≤200 arc s or ≤0.3 ng/protein/mm2 of sensor surface; “Experimental Procedures”) when a lower concentration of Npn-1 (≤1 μg/ml) was used or 3.3 μg/ml Npn-1 was added in 2 m NaCl. Immobilization of Npn-1 in the dual polarization interferometer under the latter conditions resulted in the immobilization of just 0.16 ng of protein/mm2 of sensor surface (Table I), which is within the range observed with the IAsys biosensor. This level, commensurate with that expected from simple mass action, represents a protein density equivalent to 2% of a monolayer. Npn-1 immobilized at a low density in the interferometer did not bind 10 μg/ml heparin (result not shown), but such Npn-1 did bind FGF-2 in both instruments. Taken together with the size-exclusion chromatography, the results suggest that Npn-1 is immobilized at a high density as a consequence of self-association of the Npn-1 and that in this form the Npn-1 fails to bind heparin or FGF-2. In contrast, Npn-1 immobilized at a low density is likely to consist of single, well separated protein units; the covalent link to the surface prevents subsequent self-association of these molecules. In this form Npn-1 binds FGF-2 and a range of other proteins (Fig. 1) but still does not bind heparin, which may be due to basic residues in Npn-1 that are involved in binding heparin being obscured, perhaps due to one or more reacting with the BS3. Interactions of Proteins with Npn-1—Surfaces with a low density of immobilized Npn-1 (≤200 arc s) were used to measure the interactions of proteins with Npn-1 in the IAsys biosensor. Ten proteins whose interactions with heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) are known to depend on different combinations of structural elements within the polysaccharide were tested for their ability to bind to Npn-1. The binding of three other proteins to immobilized Npn-1 was also determined: VEGF165, a known HS and Npn-1-binding protein, Npn-1 itself, and tumor necrosis factor α, which in our hands failed to bind to heparin (result not shown). None of the proteins showed significant (≥1 arc s) binding to underivatized control aminosilane surfaces, indicating that under the conditions of this assay there was no significant nonspecific binding (result not shown). In addition, when the Fc fusion partner of the Npn-1 was immobilized alone on aminosilane surfaces, no binding was observed (result not shown). Because Npn-1 binds HS (32.Mamluk R. Gechtman Z.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24818-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), it was important to exclude the possibility that the Npn-1 protein used in these experiments was associated with hepa"
https://openalex.org/W2053881022,"Modification of the phosphate groups of lipid A with 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) is required for resistance to polymyxin and cationic antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. We previously demonstrated that the enzyme ArnA catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid to yield the UDP-4″-ketopentose, uridine 5″-diphospho-β-(l-threo-pentapyranosyl-4″-ulose), which is converted by ArnB to UDP-β-(l-Ara4N). E. coli ArnA is a bi-functional enzyme with a molecular mass of ∼ 74 kDa. The oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid is catalyzed by the 345-residue C-terminal domain of ArnA. The latter shows sequence similarity to enzymes that oxidize the C-4″ position of sugar nucleotides, like UDP-galactose epimerase, dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, and UDP-xylose synthase. We now show that the 304-residue N-terminal domain catalyzes the N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate-dependent formylation of the 4″-amine of UDP-l-Ara4N, generating the novel sugar nucleotide, uridine 5″-diphospho-β-(4-deoxy-4-formamido-l-arabinose). The N-terminal domain is highly homologous tomethionyl-tRNAfMet formyltransferase. The structure of the formylated sugar nucleotide generated in vitro by ArnA was validated by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The two domains of ArnA were expressed independently as active proteins in E. coli. Both were required for maintenance of polymyxin resistance and l-Ara4N modification of lipid A. We conclude that N-formylation of UDP-l-Ara4N is an obligatory step in the biosynthesis of l-Ara4N-modified lipid A in polymyxin-resistant mutants. We further demonstrate that only the formylated sugar nucleotide is converted in vitro to an undecaprenyl phosphate-linked form by the enzyme ArnC. Because the l-Ara4N unit attached to lipid A is not derivatized with a formyl group, we postulate the existence of a deformylase, acting later in the pathway. Modification of the phosphate groups of lipid A with 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) is required for resistance to polymyxin and cationic antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. We previously demonstrated that the enzyme ArnA catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid to yield the UDP-4″-ketopentose, uridine 5″-diphospho-β-(l-threo-pentapyranosyl-4″-ulose), which is converted by ArnB to UDP-β-(l-Ara4N). E. coli ArnA is a bi-functional enzyme with a molecular mass of ∼ 74 kDa. The oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid is catalyzed by the 345-residue C-terminal domain of ArnA. The latter shows sequence similarity to enzymes that oxidize the C-4″ position of sugar nucleotides, like UDP-galactose epimerase, dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, and UDP-xylose synthase. We now show that the 304-residue N-terminal domain catalyzes the N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate-dependent formylation of the 4″-amine of UDP-l-Ara4N, generating the novel sugar nucleotide, uridine 5″-diphospho-β-(4-deoxy-4-formamido-l-arabinose). The N-terminal domain is highly homologous tomethionyl-tRNAfMet formyltransferase. The structure of the formylated sugar nucleotide generated in vitro by ArnA was validated by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The two domains of ArnA were expressed independently as active proteins in E. coli. Both were required for maintenance of polymyxin resistance and l-Ara4N modification of lipid A. We conclude that N-formylation of UDP-l-Ara4N is an obligatory step in the biosynthesis of l-Ara4N-modified lipid A in polymyxin-resistant mutants. We further demonstrate that only the formylated sugar nucleotide is converted in vitro to an undecaprenyl phosphate-linked form by the enzyme ArnC. Because the l-Ara4N unit attached to lipid A is not derivatized with a formyl group, we postulate the existence of a deformylase, acting later in the pathway.

LPS consists of three domains, which are the O-antigen, the core oligosaccharide, and the lipid A moiety (1.Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev.

The O-antigen functions as a protective barrier, whereas the core sugars maintain outer membrane integrity and provide an attachment site for the O-antigen (1.Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev.

Lipid A is the hydrophobic membrane anchor of LPS, and it is the active (endotoxin) component of LPS, accounting for many of the pathophysiological effects associated with Gram-negative sepsis (5.Parillo J.E.

Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar). Covalent modifications to Kdo2-lipid A can be induced by environmental stimuli, such as low Mg2+ concentrations or low pH (8.Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M.

The modification of at least one phosphate residue with l-Ara4N is required for maintaining resistance to certain cationic antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system and to the antibiotic polymyxin (18.Helander I.M. Kilpeläinen I. Vaara M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19.Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Resistance is due, in part, to the neutralization of the negative charges of lipid A by l-Ara4N, reducing the affinity of lipid A for cationic substances (20.Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and preventing these anti-microbial compounds from penetrating the outer membrane.The addition of pEtN and l-Ara4N groups to lipid A is controlled by the PmrA/PmrB two-component regulatory system, which is activated by low pH, high Fe3+ levels, or indirectly, by low concentrations of Mg2+ via the PhoP/PhoQ system through the action of PmrD (9.Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Activated PmrA stimulates transcription at the pmrCAB, pmrE(ugd), and pmrHFIJKLM loci (19.Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J.

Constitutive pmrA (pmrAc) mutants of E. coli and S. typhimurium are polymyxin-resistant, and they modify their lipid A with l-Ara4N and pEtN groups under all growth conditions (17.Trent M.S.

Microbiol. 1995; 16: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Inactivation of either pmrE or the genes in the pmrHFIJKLM operon results in complete loss of polymyxin resistance and of l-Ara4N-modified lipid A in pmrAc bacterial cells (19.Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 21.Gunn J.S. Ryan S.S. Van Velkinburgh J.C. Ernst R.K. Miller S.I.

Similarly, pmrAc mutants harboring a nonpolar disruption of the pmrC(eptA) gene are unable to incorporate pEtN groups into their lipid A and are slightly more sensitive to polymyxin under some growth conditions (14.Trent M.S.

Chem. 2003; 279: 24731-24739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is supported by the following observations. 1) ArnT (PmrK) is an inner membrane enzyme that transfers the l-Ara4N moiety of the glycolipid undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N to lipid A (16.Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43122-43131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). 2) ArnA(PmrI) catalyzes the oxidation and decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) to yield a molecule of uridine 5′-diphospho-β-(l-threo-pentapyranosyl-4″-ulose), also designated UDP-4″-ketopentose (or UDP-Ara4O) (25.Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 3) ArnB(PmrH) is an amino-transferase that converts the UDP-4″-ketopentose to UDP-l-Ara4N, with l-glutamate functioning as the amine donor (26.Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 24731-24739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 4) Cell extracts of polymyxin-resistant E. coli mutants, but not wild type, convert UDP-l-Ara4N to a putative formamido derivative in the presence of N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate (25.Breazeale S.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Biosynthesis of UDP-l-Ara4FN and transfer of the l-Ara4N moiety to lipid A. In polymyxin-resistant E. coli and S. typhimurium, biosynthesis of the l-Ara4N moiety begins with oxidation of UDP-glucose to UDP-GlcUA (25.Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Next, the C-terminal domain of ArnA catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-GlcUA to yield UDP-4″-ketopentose (25.Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which is converted to UDP-l-Ara4N by ArnB (26.Breazeale S.D. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 24731-24739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As reported in this study (boxed reaction), the N-terminal domain of ArnA uses N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate to convert UDP-l-Ara4N to UDP-l-Ara4FN. ArnC (a distant ortholog of dolichyl phosphate-mannose synthase) selectively transfers the l-Ara4FN residue of UDP-β-l-Ara4FN (magenta rectangle) to undecaprenyl phosphate, forming undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4FN. The ArnD-dependent deformylation of this substance to undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N (which accumulates in polymyxin resistant mutants) (17.Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J.

After transport to the outer surface of the inner membrane, the membrane protein ArnT (16.Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2886-2896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) but also catalyzes the transfer of the formyl group from N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate to the 4″-amine of UDP-l-Ara4N, yielding the novel sugar nucleotide uridine 5′-diphospho-β-(4-deoxy-4-formamido-l-arabinose) (UDP-l-Ara4FN). The analog N-5-formyltetrahydrofolate is not a substrate. In aqueous solution, purified UDP-l-Ara4FN is recovered as a 4:1 mixture of the cis-and trans-formamido rotational isomers, as judged by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, ArnA can be split into two functional proteins, a formyltransferase and a dehydrogenase, derived from the N and C termini of the full-length protein, respectively. Both domains are required for incorporation of the l-Ara4N moiety into lipid A in vivo and for the maintenance of polymyxin resistance. The formylated sugar nucleotide is needed because of the selectivity of the subsequent enzyme (ArnC), which does not utilize UDP-l-Ara4N (Fig. 2). The unanticipated requirement of the ArnA formyltransferase reaction for the maintenance of polymyxin resistance further suggests that an as yet unidentified deformylase must also exist, since neither l-Ara4N-modified lipid A (13.Zhou Z.

The latter was transformed into E. coli NovaBlue(DE3) cells (Novagen). Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C from single colonies in LB broth (31.Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh LB broth, and cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 ∼ 0.6. Expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth was continued at 30 °C for 3.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A consisting of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 300 mm NaCl. Cells were broken by one passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to yield the crude cell-free extract.The extract was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A followed by 10 volumes each of buffer A containing 10, 25, 75, and 200 mm imidazole. Some ArnAN6H eluted with 75 mm imidazole, but most emerged with 200 mm. The imidazole was removed by passing the protein over a PD-10 (Sephadex™ G-25, Amersham Biosciences) desalting column (1.5 × 5.0 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 300 mm NaCl. Expression and purification of ArnAN6H was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4% stacking gel and 8% resolving gel) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Purification based on specific activity was about 10-fold compared with the cell extract of the over-producing strain. The purified protein, which was greater than 95% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue staining, tended to precipitate at concentrations greater than 5 mg/ml.Construction of pET-ArnAFT and pET-ArnADH Expressing the Separate Domains of ArnA—The predicted coding region of the ArnA formyltransferase domain was amplified by PCR from pET-ArnA with the primers (5′-cgggatcCATATGaaaaccgtcgtttttgcctac-3′, ArnAFT5) and (5′-cgggatcCTCGAGtcacaagcgtgaaccttgcaccagg-3′, ArnAFT3) containing engineered NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (in capital letters), respectively. The Opti-Prime™ PCR kit (Stratagene) was used. Amplification in a 50-μl reaction with 10× Opti-Prime Buffer 7 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 35 mm MgCl2, 250 mm KCl), 0.2 mm dNTP, 20 ng pET-ArnA DNA, 0.5 μm primers, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase for 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min) followed by 1 cycle of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 10 min resulted in a single product of the predicted size. The product was isolated with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested with XhoI and NdeI, and ligated into the T7 expression vector, pET24b (Novagen), previously digested with the same enzymes. The product was confirmed by DNA sequencing.The dehydrogenase domain of ArnA was cloned into pET24b using the same strategy, except that the primers used were 5′-cgggatc-CATATGcgggtactcatcctcggggtg-3′ (ArnADH5) and 5′-cgggatcCTCGAGtcatgatggtttatccgtaagatc-3′ (ArnADH3), which contained engineered NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (shown in capital letters), respectively. The product was confirmed by DNA sequencing of pET-ArnADH.Expression of the ArnA Formyltransferase and ArnA Dehydrogenase Domains—-The formyltransferase (pET-ArnAFT) and dehydrogenase domains (pET-ArnADH) of ArnA were expressed in E. coli NovaBlue(DE3) (Novagen), as described above for the ArnA-H6N protein, except that a 2.5-h isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction at 30 °C was used.Construction of pWSK-ArnA, pWSK-ArnAFT, and pWSK-ArnADH— The inserts in the expression vectors pET-ArnA, pET-ArnAFT, or pET-ArnADH were excised with XbaI and XhoI and cloned into the same restriction sites of the relatively low copy vector pWSK29 (32.Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) to generate pWSK-ArnA, pWSK-ArnAFT, and pWSK-ArnADH.Construction of pSDB300 and pSDB350 —To make pSDB300 and pSDB350, we first constructed pSDB100 and pSDB150 (Supplemental Fig. 1) by cloning the ArnADH- and ArnAFT-encoding genes from pET24b (see Table I) into pET28b, respectively. To generate pSDB100, pET-ArnADH was linearized with XbaI, and a two-base fill-in was performed with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of dCTP and dTTP. The DNA encoding the ArnADH was excised with XhoI and cloned into pET28b, previously prepared with a HindIII digestion, followed by a fill-in reaction with dATP and dGTP using Klenow fragment, and then cut with XhoI (Supplemental Fig. 1). Repeating this procedure with the ArnAFT encoding DNA from pET-ArnAFT (see Table I) gave pSDB150. pSDB200 was constructed by excising the ArnAFT encoding DNA from pET-ArnAFT with XbaI and XhoI and then ligating this fragment into the XbaI and SalI sites of pSDB100 (Supplemental Fig. 1). Similarly, pSDB250 was made by first excising the ArnADH-encoding DNA from pET-ArnADH with XbaI and XhoI and then ligating this into the XbaI and SalI sites of pSDB150 (Supplemental Fig. 1). Ligating the XbaI-XhoI fragment of pSDB200 into these same restriction sites of pWSK29 resulted in the construction of pSDB300, which contains the arnAFT followed by arnADH, each with a ribosomal binding site derived from pET28b just upstream of the cloned genes. Similarly, pSDB350 was constructed by ligating the XbaI/XhoI fragment of pSDB250 into these same restriction sites of pWSK29 (Supplemental Fig. 1). pSDB350 contains the arnADH followed by arnAFT, each with a ribosomal binding site derived from pET28b just upstream of the cloned genes.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrains and plasmidsDescriptionSource or referenceE. coli W3110Wild type, F−, λ−E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale WD101W3110, pmrAc, Pmr17.Trent M.S.

https://openalex.org/W2026617356,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important metabolic stress-sensing protein kinase responsible for regulating metabolism in response to changing energy demand and nutrient supply. Mammalian AMPK is a stable αβγ heterotrimer comprising a catalytic α and two non-catalytic subunits, β and γ. The β subunit targets AMPK to membranes via an N-terminal myristoyl group and to glycogen via a mid-molecule glycogen-binding domain. Here we find that the conserved C-terminal 85-residue sequence of the β subunit, β1-(186–270), is sufficient to form an active AMP-dependent heterotrimer α1β1-(186–270)-γ1, whereas the 25-residue β1 C-terminal (246–270) sequence is sufficient to bind γ1, γ2, or γ3 but not the α subunit. Deletion of the β C-terminal Ile-270 precludes βγ association in the absence of the α subunit, but the presence of the α subunit or substitution of Ile-270 with Ala or Glu restores βγ binding. Truncation of the α subunit reveals that β1 binding requires the α1-(313–473) sequence. The conserved C-terminal 85-residue sequence of the β subunit (90% between β1 and β2) is the primary αγ binding sequence responsible for the formation of the AMPK αβγ heterotrimer."

However, details of this pathway are not well understood, including the number and order of proteases involved. Protease inhibitors from the serpin superfamily appear to regulate the proteases in the pathway. Manduca sexta serpin-4 and serpin-5 suppress pro-PO activation in plasma, apparently by inhibiting proteases upstream of the direct activator of pro-PO. To identify plasma proteases inhibited by these serpins, we used immunoaffinity chromatography with serpin antibodies to isolate serpin-protease complexes that formed after activation of the cascade by exposure of plasma to bacteria or lipopolysaccharide. Covalent complexes of serpin-4 with hemolymph proteases HP-1 and HP-6 appeared in plasma activated by Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria, whereas serpin-4 complexes with HP-21 and two unidentified proteases were unique to plasma treated with Gram-positive bacteria. HP-1 and HP-6 were also identified as target proteases of serpin-5, forming covalent complexes after bacterial activation of the cascade. These results suggest that HP-1 and HP-6 may be components of the pro-PO activation pathway, which are activated in response to infection and regulated by serpin-4 and serpin-5. HP-21 and two unidentified proteases may participate in a Gram-positive bacteria-specific branch of the pathway. Several plasma proteins that co-purified with serpin-protease complexes, most notably immulectins and serine protease homologs, are known to be components of the pro-PO activation pathway.

Bacteria or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was then added to the plasma to stimulate activation of protease cascades. Dried M. luteus (Sigma) was added (0.5 μg/μl) to plasma from larvae previously injected with M. luteus. Formaldehyde-killed E. coli XL-1 (1 × 108 cells/ml) or LPS from E. coli 026/B6 (0.01 μg/μl, Sigma) was added to the plasma from larvae induced by E. coli. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma; final concentration 5 mm) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8849; 1 ml for 30 ml of plasma) were added to inactivate proteases. After 10 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 1–2 ml of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads coupled with serpin antibody overnight at 4 °C, and the mixture was then packed into a column. The column was washed with 20 volumes of 1 m NaCl and then 10 volumes of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. For purification of serpin-5 complexes from E. coli-treated plasma, these washing steps were replaced with 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 4.3 mm Na2PO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and then 10 volumes of 0.5 m NaCl. The columns were eluted with 10 volumes of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, 10% ethylene glycol.

Determination of Amino-terminal Sequences—Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, stained with 0.025% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 40% methanol, and destained with 50% methanol. The protein bands of interest were excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation sequencing. Serpin-protease complexes were sequenced by the HHMI/Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University. Other proteins were sequenced by the Biotechnology Microchemical Core Facility, Kansas State University. Mass Spectrometry Analyses—To identify serpin-4- and serpin-5-protease complexes after separation by SDS-PAGE, the bands were excised, reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and then subjected to in-gel digestion with modified l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated porcine trypsin (Promega). The tryptic peptide pools were evaporated to near-dryness and desalted on C18 Ziptips (Millipore). The eluted peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry in the Proteomics Center, University of Missouri, Columbia. Spectra were acquired in the positive ion delayed extraction reflector mode on a Voyager DEPro mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Spectra were calibrated with a six-peptide calibration standard mixture. The peptide masses were used to search the NCBI nonredundant protein sequence data base with ProFound (prowl.rockefeller.edu/) or MASCOT Peptide Mass Fingerprint (www.matrixscience.com/) programs. The mass values were also compared with the masses calculated for tryptic peptides derived from M. sexta hemolymph proteases, using the MS-Digest program of ProteinProspector version 4.0.5 (prospector.ucsf.edu/). Inhibition of Pro-HP and Pro-SPH Activation by Serpin-4 or Serpin-5—Samples of 2 μl of plasma were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in the presence or absence of recombinant serpin-4 or serpin-5 (final concentration 0.4 μg/μl), then activated by addition of M. luteus in saline (0.4 μg/μl), and incubated at room temperature for 10 min (43Tong Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14923-14931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with available HP or SPH antibodies. Identification and Purification of Serpin-Protease Complexes—Serpin-4 and serpin-5 antibodies detected bands in untreated plasma representing intact serpins (∼50 kDa) and a minor, slightly smaller protein consistent with cleaved serpin (Fig. 1). After incubation with M. luteus, E. coli, or LPS, the intensity of the 50-kDa band was reduced, and the 45-kDa band increased, suggesting that some intact serpins were converted to the cleaved form. At the same time, higher molecular weight bands (∼70 kDa) containing serpin-4 or serpin-5 appeared, consistent with the expected size for serpin-protease complexes (Fig. 1). Apparently, the exposure to bacteria/LPS led to the activation of plasma proteases, which formed covalent complexes with serpin-4 and serpin-5. Similar changes occurred in plasma from naive larvae (data not shown), although all of the serpin bands were less intense due to lower concentration of serpin-4 and serpin-5 in plasma from naive animals. Treatment of plasma with M. luteus consistently stimulated the formation of more intense serpin-4-protease complex bands than did treatment with LPS. To identify the proteases inhibited by serpin-4 or serpin-5, we purified the serpin-protease complexes by immunoaffinity chromatography by using the serpin antibodies. Five serpin-4-protease complexes (SPC4-1–5) were isolated from M. luteus-treated plasma (Fig. 2). Two serpin-4-protease complexes, which had the same electrophoretic mobility as SPC4-1 and SPC4-5, were isolated from LPS-treated plasma (Fig. 2). The appearance of the multiple serpin-4-protease complex bands suggests that serpin-4 inhibited several plasma proteases. Two serpin-5-protease complexes (SPC5H and SPC5L) were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using serpin-5 antibody (Fig. 3). These two SPCs were present in plasma treated with M. luteus or E. coli.Fig. 3Purification and identification of serpin-5-protease complexes from plasma.

Based on their apparent masses, we named the most abundant of these proteins P42, P40, P37, and P34 (Figs. 2A and 3A). The association of these proteins with serpin-4 and serpin-5 was apparently not due to incomplete washing of the columns, because the abundance of these proteins in plasma is much lower than major hemolymph proteins (e.g. hexamerin storage proteins and lipophorin) that did not bind to the antibody columns. In controls using columns coupled with antibodies from preimmune sera, these proteins did not bind (data not shown), further indicating their specific interaction with serpin-4 and serpin-5 or with plasma proteins that interact with the serpins. Identification of Proteases in Serpin-Protease Complexes—We have cloned cDNAs for 25 M. sexta hemolymph proteases, including three PAPs and other HPs synthesized in fat body or hemocytes (7Jiang H.

Wang, and M. R. Kanost, unpublished results. and we prepared antibodies to 16 of these proteases. To test whether these proteases were present in the isolated serpin-4 and serpin-5 complexes described above, we analyzed fractions containing the complexes by immunoblotting, using the HP antibodies. Antibodies to proteases HP-1, HP-6, and HP-21 bound to complex bands SPC4-1, SPC4-5, and SPC4-4, respectively (Fig. 2B). The SPC4-4 band recognized by antibody to HP-21 was present in M. luteus-treated plasma but not in plasma treated with LPS (Fig. 2B), consistent with the result using serpin-4 antibody. Likewise, a 31-kDa band detected by HP-21 antibody (consistent in size with the catalytic domain of active HP-21) was detected only in M. luteus-treated plasma. These results indicate that HP-21 might be involved in a response specific to Gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, the putative catalytic domains of both HP-1 and HP-6 and their complexes with serpin-4 were detected in fractions obtained after treatment with LPS or M. luteus (Fig. 2B). None of the available HP antibodies recognized SPC4-2 or SPC4-3, which were present only in plasma samples activated by treatment with M. luteus. SPC5H (∼85 kDa) was recognized by antibodies to serpin-5 and HP-1, whereas SPC5L (∼70 kDa) was recognized by serpin-5 and HP-6 antibodies (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that serpin-5 regulates HP-1 and HP-6, which are activated in the presence of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. HP-1, HP-6, and HP-21 belong to a family of proteases that contain an amino-terminal clip domain and a serine protease domain, linked by a disulfide bond. They are predicted to be activated by specific cleavage between the clip domain and the protease domain (2Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In SDS-PAGE of a serpin-protease complex, it is expected that the catalytic domain of the protease will remain connected to the serpin through a covalent bond between the catalytic serine residue of the protease and the P1 residue of the serpin. The clip domain is released under reducing conditions due to reduction of the disulfide bond that links the clip and protease domains. In Edman degradation analysis of a serpin-protease complex, two amino-terminal sequences can be expected, one for the serpin and one for the catalytic domain of the protease. Amino-terminal sequencing of proteins in SPC4-1, SPC4-4, and SPC4-5 bands isolated from gels showed that all three complexes contained a sequence matching the amino-terminal sequence of serpin-4 (Table I). SPC4-5 also yielded phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives expected from the HP-6 catalytic chain, consistent with the immunoblot result (Fig. 2B) indicating that SPC4-5 is a complex of serpin-4 with HP-6. However, no second sequence was detected in SPC4-1 or SPC4-4, perhaps due to blocking of the amino termini of the proteases.Table IAmino-terminal sequencing by automated Edman degradation of serpin-4-protease complexesExperimental resultsExpected sequencesCycleSPC4-1 and SPC4-4SPC4-5Serpin-4HP-6 catalytic domainPhenoloxidase-11AspAsp, Ile, PheAspIlePhe2AspAsp, Leu, GlyAspLeuGly3LeuLeu, Gly, AsnLeuGlyAsn4ProPro, Gly, Gl"
https://openalex.org/W1969819496,"Infection stimulates the innate immune responses of insects, including activation of prophenol oxidase (pro-PO) in plasma as the last step of a serine protease cascade. To investigate the roles of protease inhibitors in regulating this pathway, we cloned cDNAs for two new serpins (serpin-4 and serpin-5) from the tobacco hornworm, <i>Manduca sexta</i>. Serpin-4 and serpin-5 mRNAs are constitutively expressed at a low level in larval hemocytes and fat body and increased dramatically upon bacterial challenge. These serpins are present in larval plasma at ∼3 (serpin-4) and ∼1 μg/ml (serpin-5) and increased 3–8-fold by 24 h after injection of bacteria or fungi. Recombinant serpin-4 and serpin-5 decreased pro-PO activation when added to plasma, but they did not directly inhibit the pro-PO-activating proteases. Instead, they apparently regulate the pathway by inhibiting one or more target proteases upstream of the pro-PO-activating proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2015859607,"STAT6 is a critical regulator of transcription for interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced genes. Activation of gene expression involves recruitment of coactivator proteins that function as bridging factors connecting sequence-specific transcription factors to the basal transcription machinery, and as chromatin-modifying enzymes. Coactivator proteins CBP/p300 have been implicated in regulation of transcription in all STATs. CBP is also required for STAT6-mediated gene activation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. In this study we investigated the mechanisms by which STAT6 recruits CBP and chromatin-modifying activities to the promoter. Our results indicate that while STAT1-interacted directly with CBP, the interaction between STAT6 and CBP was found to be mediated through p100 protein, a coactivator protein that has previously been shown to stimulate the transcription of IL-4-induced genes. The staphylococcal nuclease-like (SN)-domains of p100 directly interacted with amino acids 1099–1758 of CBP, while p100 did not associate with SRC-1, another coactivator of STAT6. p100 was found to recruit histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity to STAT6 in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that p100 increases the STAT6-p100-CBP ternary complex formation in the human Igϵ promoter. p100 also increased the amount of acetylated histone H4 at the Igϵ promoter, and siRNAs directed against p100 effectively inhibited Igϵ reporter gene expression. Our results suggest that p100 has an important role in the assembly of STAT6 transcriptosome, and that p100 stimulates IL-4-dependent transcription by mediating interaction between STAT6 and CBP and recruiting chromatin modifying activities to STAT6-responsive promoters.

Darnell Jr, J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Cytokines bind to their cognate receptors at the cell surface, which leads to the activation of receptor-associated JAK kinases, which in turn activate STATs by phosphorylating them at the conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue. The activated STATs undergo dimerization through a reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction and translocate to the nucleus, where the STAT dimers bind to symmetrical TTC(N2–4)GAA DNA target elements. The specificity in cytokine signaling is conveyed by selective activation of different STATs by individual cytokine receptors, specific recognition of target DNA elements by various STATs, and through selective interaction and cooperation with other transcription factors and regulatory proteins. The family of STAT proteins consists of seven members that mediate highly specific functions in cytokine signaling. STAT6 is mediating interleukin-4 (IL-4)- and IL-13-induced gene responses (2Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). IL-4 is an important regulator of immune and anti-inflammatory responses. In T cells IL-4 mediates induction of Th2 differentiation, while inhibiting Th1 development, and in B cells IL-4 triggers the immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype class switching and production of IgG1 and IgE. Several genes that are critical for these responses are directly regulated by STAT6, and e.g. the promoter regions of Ig heavy chain germline Igϵ and Igγ1, CD23, and major histocompatibility complex class II promoters contain functional STAT6 response elements (3Rengarajan J.

The initiation of transcription requires sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors and their cooperation with transcriptional coregulatory proteins and the basal transcription machinery. STAT6 cooperates with several cis-acting transcription factors such as PU.1, IRF-4, BSAP, NF-κB, and C/EBPβ (6Pesu M. Aittomaki S. Valineva T. Silvennoinen O. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 1822-1828PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation is also critically regulated by coactivator proteins, which are often recruited by transactivation domains (TADs). In STATs the C-terminal TAD is the most variable domain between different STATs. Recruitment of distinct coactivator complexes by various TADs may contribute to transcriptional specificity in cytokine signaling (12Goenka S. Marlar C. Schindler U. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50362-50370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have previously identified p100 protein as a STAT6-TAD interacting protein that enhances STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation and gene expression (13Yang J. Aittomaki S. Pesu M. Carter K. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Kieff E. Silvennoinen O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). p100 protein was first identified as a coactivator for the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) (14Tong X. Drapkin R. Yalamanchili R. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4735-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and subsequently found to interact with other transcription factors such as TFIIE, c-Myb (15Dash A.B. Orrico F.C. Ness S.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and STAT5 (16Paukku K. Yang J. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Also a member of the p160/SRC family of steroid receptor coactivator proteins SRC-1 (also called NcoA-1) directly interacts with the TAD of STAT6 (17Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45713-45721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). SRC-1 functions as a coactivator for STAT6, as well as for STAT3 (18Giraud S. Bienvenu F. Avril S.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45340-45351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Also another member of the p160/SRC family coactivators p/CIP (NcoA-3) indirectly interacts with STAT6 via p300 (20Arimura A. vn Peer M. Schroder A.J. Rothman P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31105-31112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An important function for the coactivator proteins is to relieve the repression of the tightly packed DNA by remodeling chromatin by post-translational modifications. Acetylation of lysine residues in the core histone proteins, particularly H3 and H4, opens the chromatin structure and allows transcription to proceed. Many transcriptional coactivators are histone acetylases (HATs), while corepressors often possess deacetylase activity (21Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). SRC-1 has been shown to possess some HAT activity, but the mechanism of SRC-1 coactivation in STAT signaling is unknown. Generally, the contribution of SRC-1 to transcriptional activation is considered to occur through recruitment of CREB-binding protein (CBP) and the highly homologous p300 to transcription factors. CBP/p300 are multifunctional coactivator proteins that act as molecular integrators of several signaling pathways and mediate important functions in transcriptional regulation (22Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CBP/p300 are ubiquitously expressed and they have been implicated in coactivation of all STATs (23Horvai A.E. Xu L.

An important question in IL-4-mediated gene regulation is the mechanism by which chromatin-modifying activities are targeted to STAT6 responsive elements and how these activities are regulated. Previous analysis of coactivators in STAT signaling has been defining the molecular interactions and the functional end point in gene regulation. This study was aimed at investigating the mechanisms by which STAT6 is recruiting histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity to the promoter. Our results indicate that the coactivator protein p100 is mediating interaction between STAT6 and CBP, and recruits HAT activity to STAT6. p100 also increases the amount acetylated histone H4 that associates with Igϵ promoter. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that p100 protein functions as an important adapter and HAT recruiting and regulating factor for STAT6-dependent transcription. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Plasmids—HeLa cells and COS-7 cells were grown as previously reported (13Yang J. Aittomaki S. Pesu M. Carter K. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Kieff E. Silvennoinen O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Transfection of HeLa cells was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation with a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 260 V/960 microfarads. pSG5-p100-FLAG, pSG5-p100-SN-FLAG, pSG5-p100-TD-FLAG, and pCIneo-STAT6-HA plasmids were constructed as previously described (13Yang J.

The pSG5 expression plasmids containing first and second SN-like domain (SN1 + 2, amino acids 1–319), or third and fourth SN-like domain (SN3 + 4, amino acids 320–639) of human p100 protein were generated by PCR using primers containing C-terminal FLAG sequence. STAT1α, Igϵ-reporter, pSG5-SRC-1a, and pSG5-SRC-1e plasmids have been described previously (35Aittomaki S. Pesu M. Groner B. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Silvennoinen O. J.

GST-St1-TAD was constructed by cloning PCR products corresponding to amino acids 711–750 of human STAT1 into pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST-St6-TAD (amino acids 642–847) was constructed as previously reported (13Yang J. Aittomaki S. Pesu M. Carter K. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Kieff E. Silvennoinen O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). GST-St6-TAD-6 was constructed by cloning PCR products corresponding to amino acids 794–847 of human STAT6 into pGEX-4T-1 vector. GST-p100-SN, GST-p100-TD plasmids were constructed as previously described (13Yang J. Aittomaki S. Pesu M. Carter K. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Kieff E. Silvennoinen O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). GST-CBP-D1 (amino acids 1–452), D2 (amino acids 452–1099), D3 (amino acids 1099–1620), D4 (amino acids 1620–1877), D5 (amino acids 1877–2441), and HAT (amino acids 1099–1758) were generated by PCR amplification of the relevant domain of CBP and inserted into pGEX-4T-1 vector. pBlue-CBP-D1 (amino acids 1–452), D2 (amino acids 452–1099), D3 (amino acids 1099–1758), and D4 (amino acids 1758–2441) were constructed by PCR amplification of the related domains of CBP and inserted into BamHI and XbaI sites. All PCR products were sequenced. GST pull-down assays—GST fusion proteins were bound on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins, COS-7 cell lysates or HeLa cell nuclear lysates (as described in Ref. 13Yang J. Aittomaki S. Pesu M. Carter K. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Kieff E. Silvennoinen O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Nuclear lysates of HeLa cells were prepared as previously described (13Yang J. Aittomaki S. Pesu M. Carter K. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Kieff E. Silvennoinen O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After washing, the bound proteins were eluted from beads, separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-SRC-1 (Upstate Biotech) antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—Transfected COS-7 cells were resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium butyrate). Protein concentrations of the lysates were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The cell lysates transfected with CBP together with p100-FLAG or STAT6-HA were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-CBP antibody or rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a control. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by blotting with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or anti-HA antibody (clone 16B 12; BabCO). Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells were starved in serum-free medium for 4 h and treated with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) for 20 min or left untreated. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% formaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8) for 10 min at room temperature and postfixed thereafter with methanol for 5 min at –20 °C. Cells were stained either with the mixture of anti-STAT6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-p100 (14Tong X. Drapkin R. Yalamanchili R. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4735-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), or the mixture of anti-STAT6 and anti-CBP antibodies, followed by washing with Alexa 488 anti-mouse and Texas Red anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Confocal images were collected using LSM510 program and Zeiss confocal microscope, equipped with an Argon laser (488 nm) and HeNe laser (543 nm) and a ×63 objective. Green emission was detected using a 505-nm low pass filter and red emission using a 630-nm low pass filter. HAT Assays with Immunopurified Proteins—Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride) supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin. Protein concentrations of the lysates were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The lysates of cells transfected with STAT6 alone or together with CBP and/or p100-FLAG were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT6 antibody. The lysates of cells transfected with STAT1 alone or together with CBP were immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-STAT1 antibody (N terminus) (Transduction Laboratories, BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitated proteins were collected on protein A/G beads. The beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) and HAT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin. The beads were then incubated with H4 substrate (synthetic peptide containing the first 23 amino acids of histone H4 coupled through a linker sequence to a biotin molecule) and [3H]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences) at 30 °C for 45 min. The acetylated substrate was collected with immobilized streptavidin (Sigma) at room temperature for 20 min and then washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Following the washing, 500 μl of the HAT buffer was added to resuspend the resin, and the contents were transferred to the scintillation vial. 1 ml of scintillation fluid (Optiphase Supermix liquid scintillation mixture; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wallac) was added, and the associated radioactivity was counted with 1450 MicroBeta Plus liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wallac) for 5 min per vial. To compare the protein concentrations, the amounts of STAT1, STAT6, and p100 proteins in the lysates were analyzed by blotting with anti-HA (clone 16B 12; BabCO) and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies. To compare the amount of CBP between samples, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were collected on protein A beads. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by blotting with anti-CBP antibody. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were transfected with pSG5-p100-FLAG or empty vector. Formaldehyde was added to the IL-4 or mock-treated cells at a final concentration of 1%. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 100 mm. The cells were washed and harvested and the soluble chromatin was prepared according to the protocol by Nissen and Yamamoto (38Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Chromatin was sonicated to an average length of 200–1000 bp using Vibra Cell 500 watt sonicator (Sonics & Materials, Inc., Newtown, CT) with microtip. After centrifugation, samples were precleared with protein A beads and immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT6, anti-CBP, anti-acetyl-histone H4 (Upstate Biotech), anti-HA (clone 16B 12; BabCO), or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, and the immunocomplexes were collected onto protein A beads. Beads were washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 and once with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). The chromatin fragments were eluted from beads with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and cross-links were reverted by heating at 65 °C overnight. DNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed for human Igϵ promoter using PCR. The PCR reactions were performed in a 25-μl volume with 10 μl of immunoprecipitated material, using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 35 PCR cycles. The following primers were used: 5′-TGGGCCTGAGAGAGAAGAGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTCTGCCTCAGTGCTTTC-3′. The extract aliquoted before the immunoprecipitation step (total input chromatin) was also used for PCR analysis. p100 RNAi—siRNAs were generated using the Ambion Silencer™ siRNA Construction kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sense and antisense primers corresponding to the following target sequences were used: p100 I 5′-AAGGCATGAGAGCTAATAATC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 602–622 of human p100 mRNA), p100 II 5′-AAGGAGCGATCTGCTAGCTAC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 2218–2238 of human p100 mRNA). Primers were extended with the sequence 5′-CCTGTCTC-3′ at the 3′-end. Transfection of cells was performed as follows: HeLa cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells per well and incubated for 24 h before transfection. Cotransfection of 100 ng of Igϵ-reporter, 50 ng of β-galactosidase, and siRNAs (final concentration 60 pm) were performed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection cells were either stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-4 or left untreated. Cells were lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) 48 h after transfection. Luciferase expression was determined using the Luciferase Assay system (Promega), and the results were normalized against β-galactosidase activity of the lysates. Interaction of CBP with STAT1-TAD and STAT6-TAD—Several lines of evidence have implicated histone acetylation in IL-4-mediated gene responses. Histone acetylation has been shown to occur at the IL-4 locus during Th2 differentiation (39Fields P.E. Kim S.T. Flavell R.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and during IL-4-induced gene activation (40Shankaranarayanan P. Chaitidis P. Kuhn H. Nigam S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42753-42760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of acetyltransferase activity of CBP by adenoviral E1A protein has been shown to repress IL-4- and STAT6-regulated gene activation (30McDonald C. Reich N.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Gingras S. Simard J. Groner B. Pfitzner E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42753-42760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we wanted to gain further insight into the function of CBP/p300 in STAT6-mediated gene activation. The TAD domains are the most divergent domains in STATs, and it is reasonable to assume that STATs may utilize different mechanisms to interact with coactivator proteins. The TAD of STAT1 has been shown to interact directly with CBP/p300 (23Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 24Zhang J.J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W. Chakravarti D. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15092-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and in initial experiments the interaction of CBP with STAT1 and STAT6 was compared. To investigate whether the TAD of STAT6 is interacting directly with CBP, GST pull-down assays were performed by incubating GST-STAT1-TAD and STAT6-TAD with endogenous nuclear proteins from HeLa cells. CBP was found to bind strongly with GST-STAT1-TAD while only a very weak interaction with GST-STAT6-TAD was detected in the same experiment (Fig. 1A). Similar GST pull-down experiments were also performed with COS-7 cells that overexpressed CBP. As shown in Fig. 1B, CBP strongly associated with GST-STAT1-TAD, while there was no detectable association between CBP and GST-STAT6-TAD. The expression levels of GST fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 1C. The results indicate that the lack of STAT6-CBP interaction is not caused by limitation of sensitivity in the detection methods. These results suggested that CBP/p300 may not interact directly with STAT6-TAD, but the interaction may require additional proteins as bridging factors. Alternatively the interaction may require secondary modifications in STAT6-TAD, or be mediated through N-terminal domains of STAT6. p100 Interacts with CBP in Vivo—p100 is a transcriptional coactivator that functions as an adapter between different transcription factors. We have previously shown that p100 protein directly interacts with the TAD of STAT6 and functions as a coactivator for STAT6 (13Yang J. Aittomaki S. Pesu M. Carter K. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Kieff E. Silvennoinen O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and thereby we wanted to investigate whether p100 protein would interact with CBP. To this end, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were conducted to study the interaction of p100 and STAT6 with CBP in vivo. COS-7 cells were transfected with CBP and FLAG epitope-tagged p100 (p100-FLAG) or HA epitope-tagged STAT6 (STAT6-HA). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CBP antibody or control IgG antibody, and p100 and STAT6 were detected with anti-FLAG or anti-HA immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, upper panel, p100 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with CBP but not with the control rabbit IgG antibody. In contrast, there was no detectable coimmunoprecipitation between STAT6 and CBP under similar experimental conditions suggesting that there are no high affinity interactions between the proteins (Fig. 2B, upper panel). The middle and lower panels of Fig. 2, A and B show CBP, p100, and STAT6 protein levels. IL-4 stimulation did not induce interaction between CBP and STAT6 (data not shown) thus posttranslational modifications are not likely to provide explanation for the lack of interaction. STAT6 but Not p100 Interacts with SRC-1—Next we wanted to gain further insight into the specificity of p100 interactions in the assembly of STAT6 transcriptosome. SRC-1 is known to stimulate STAT6 gene responses and to directly interact with both CBP and STAT6-TAD (41Yao T.P. Ku G. Zhou N. Scully R. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it has been shown that IFN-γ is also involved in central nervous system development. Here we studied the underlying mechanism for IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation using the human neuroblastoma Paju cell line. Our results indicate that IFN-γ treatment led to neurite outgrowth followed by growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. IFN-γ induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and subsequently the transcription factor early gene response 1, which in turn up-regulated p35 expression and increased cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity. IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth was abolished by the treatment of MEK1/2 kinase inhibitors, such as U0126 and PD98059, which inhibit the ERK1/2 activation and subsequently prevent the up-regulation of p35 expression and Cdk5 activity. In agreement with the role of p35-Cdk5 in neuronal differentiation, small interfering RNA targeting Cdk5 abrogate the IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that IFN-γ-triggered neuronal differentiation mediated through the up-regulation of p35-associated Cdk5 depends on the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Therefore, the present study suggests that IFN-γ is not only involved in tumorigenicity but also involved in neurogenesis by regulating cell proliferation and differentiation.

However, it has also been reported that IFN-γ plays a role in embryonic neural differentiation and neuronal survival. For example, IFN-γ enhances nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth (2.Improta T. Salvatore A.M. Di Luzio A. Romeo G. Coccia E.M. Calissano P. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 179: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), increases neuronal numbers in embryonic cortical and hippocampal cultures (3.Jonakait G.M. Wei R. Sheng Z.L. Hart R.P. Ni L. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and promotes cholinergic differentiation of septal nucleus and basal forebrain neurons (4.Barish M.E. Mansdorf N.B. Raissdana S.S. Dev. Biol. 1991; 144: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). IFN-γ also appears to affect the differentiation of neural stem cells (5.Wong G. Goldshmit Y. Turnley A.M. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 187: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). While in combination with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily death ligands, such as TNFα, Fas ligand/CD95 ligand, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), IFN-γ can induce apoptosis in both human brain cells and neuroblastoma cells (6.Saas P. Boucraut J. Quiquerez A.L. Schnuriger V. Perrin G. Desplat-Jego S. Bernard D. Walker P.R. Dietrich P.Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2326-2333PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Fulda S. Debatin K.M.

However, the potentiation mechanisms of IFN-γ on death receptor-mediated apoptosis are not fully understood, and no study has yet illustrated the molecular mechanisms of IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation. To elucidate the effects of IFN-γ on cell survival and death and to further discern the signaling pathways that are responsible for IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation, we conducted a series of experiments using Paju cells, a neuroblastoma cell line that was established from human neural crest-derived tumor (9.Zhang K.Z. Westberg J.A. Holtta E. Andersson L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4504-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As observed in some other neuroblastomas (10.Encinas M.

Zhang K.Z. Andersson L.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1621-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a small serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in neuronal migration, differentiation, and survival during central nervous system development. Cdk5 kinase activity has been shown to be dependent upon p35, a neuron-specific Cdk5 activator (13.Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Expression of p35 and Cdk5 kinase activity have been shown to increase during in vitro neuronal differentiation, and mutant mice lacking either Cdk5 or p35 exhibit defective neuronal migration and cortical lamination in the developing mouse brain (14.Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna, Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 15.Chae T.

Increased p35 expression and Cdk5 activity are essential for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and are also required for Fas-mediated neuronal differentiation in vivo (16.Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 17.Desbarats J. Birge R.B. Mimouni-Rongy M. Weinstein D.E. Palerme J.S. Newell M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We found that treatment with IFN-γ also resulted in neuritic outgrowth of Paju cells and generated nearly pure populations of human neuron-like cells, which provided a model to explore the molecular mechanisms of IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation. Treatment of Paju cells with IFN-γ significantly increased the expression of p35 and Cdk5 activity through the activation of the extracellular-signal regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and the early gene response 1 (Egr1) pathway. In addition, co-treatment with Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb), but not TRAIL, enhanced IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that the signaling pathway initiated by IFN-γ occurred through the ERK-Egr1-p35-Cdk5 pathway. Antibodies and Materials—Primary monoclonal antibodies included anti-human Fas mAb (CH-11) and caspase-8 (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), and DNA fragmentation factor 45 (DFF45; StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada). Primary polyclonal rabbit antibodies included anti-human caspase-3 and ERK1/2 (StressGen), p-ERK and Egr1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), p35, Cdk5, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies included HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2b and IgG1 antibodies (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Recombinant human TRAIL (amino acids 114–281) was obtained from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). RPMI 1640 medium was purchased from Invitrogen, and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PD98059, U0126, and LY294002 were purchased from New England Biolabs. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Cdk5 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Dharmacon). Protein quantification reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories, and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for Western blot analysis were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Protease inhibitor mixtures, IFN-γ, roscovitine, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Wild-type and dominant-negative Cdk5 cDNAs in pcDNA3.1 vector were kindly provided by Dr. Li-Huei Tsai (Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA). Cell Culture—Paju, a human neural crest-derived tumor cell line, was a gift from Dr. L. Andersson (Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland). The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin (20 units/ml), streptomycin (20 μg/ml), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a saturated humidity atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Death Receptor Analysis—Expression of Fas, DR4, and DR5 receptors was measured by flow cytometry. Briefly, 0.1 μg of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human Fas, DR4, and DR5 (mouse IgG1) or mouse IgG1 (negative control) was added to 1 × 106 cells in 200 μl of PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.02% sodium azide. Cells were incubated for 1 h in the dark at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and suspended in 500 μl of PBS. Samples were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACScan (Mountain View, CA), and the data were processed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Cell Viability, Apoptosis, and Cell Cycle Analysis—To examine cell viability, apoptotic death, and cell cycle progression, cells (15 × 103/cm2) were plated in 6-well plates or 100-mm dishes, and treatments were started at 24 h after plating. Cells were harvested at predetermined time points after treatments, and viable cells were determined using the trypan blue exclusion assay (18.Xiao C. Yang B.F. Asadi N. Beguinot F. Hao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25020-25025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The number of viable cells in culture was also measured with acid phosphatase assay in 96-well plates (19.Song J.H. Slot A.J. Ryan R.W. Ross G.M. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 984-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for sub-G1 content (20.Shu C.H. Yang W.K. Shih Y.L. Kuo M.L. Huang T.S. Apoptosis. 1997; 2: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cell cycle analysis was carried out by staining the DNA with propidium iodide. Briefly, cells grown in a subconfluent culture were collected by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and fixed by incubation in 1% paraformaldehyde and then in 70% ethanol solution at 4 °C. The washed pellet was stained using a propidium iodide-RNase solution (PBS containing 20 μg/ml propium iodide, 200 μg/ml Dnase-free RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at 20 °C in the dark. The cell cycle status was analyzed with a flow cytometer using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House Inc.). Cell Staining and Neurite Outgrowth—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min, washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked for 40 min with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated overnight with monoclonal rabbit anti-human NF-H (1:100; 200K; Sigma), diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100, washed three times in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated at room temperature for 40 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:200 in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100; Jackson Immuno-Research). Finally, the cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted with Cytoseal (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). The cells were observed with a Leica fluorescence microscope. Paju cell differentiation was determined by scoring for neurite outgrowth. Cells possessing one or more neurites with a length >1.5-fold of the diameter of the cell body were scored as positive. Western Blot Analysis—Cells grown in a subconfluent culture were lyzed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants were collected. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20)) for1hat room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in the blocking buffer. The membranes were washed in TBST and incubated for1hat room temperature with the following secondary antibodies diluted in TBST: anti-mouse IgG2b-HRP (1:5,000) and anti-mouse IgG1-HRP (1:10,000) or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:5,000) according to the primary antibody used. The blots were then washed and developed by chemiluminescence. Transfection of cDNA and siRNA—Paju cells were grown in 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well. The cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of wild-type or dominant-negative Cdk5 cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection of siRNA targeting Cdk5 (SMARTpool™ containing four pooled SMARTselected siRNA duplexes) was performed using TransMessenger transfection reagent from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were allowed to grow for 36 h following transfection and then were experimentally treated as outlined under “Results.” Cdk5 Kinase Assay—Cells were lyzed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (or 7.4), containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min. For Cdk5 immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-Cdk5 (c-8) for 4 h at 4 °C. The Cdk5 immunoprecipitates were placed in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) with 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and then 10 μg of histone-H1 and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by spotting 30 μl of the reaction mixture on P81 phosphocellulose pads (Upstate) that were washed five times with 0.75% phosphoric acid followed by rinsing with acetone. Radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. In some experiments, in vitro Cdk5 kinase activity was also analyzed by Western blotting. Neuroblastoma Paju Cells Are Resistant to Death Receptor-mediated Apoptosis—A recent study demonstrated that IFN-γ sensitizes some neuroblastoma cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis (7.Fulda S. Debatin K.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2295-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To investigate whether IFN-γ enhances apoptosis induced by Fas and TRAIL, we first analyzed the expression of death receptors in Paju cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that Paju cells expressed cell surface Fas and DR5 but failed to reveal DR4 expression (Fig. 1a). Exposure of the cells to IFN-γ for 24 h significantly increased Fas expression, whereas no increase in DR4 and DR5 expression was evident (Fig. 1a). Next, we examined whether Fas and TRAIL can induce apoptosis in Paju cells. As we previously reported (18.Xiao C. Yang B.F. Asadi N. Beguinot F. Hao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25020-25025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 21.Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar), Jurkat T leukemia cells are susceptible to apoptosis induced by agonistic Fas mAb and TRAIL (Fig. 1b). However, parallel cultures of Paju cells did not show any evidence of apoptosis following treatment with Fas mAb or TRAIL (Fig. 1b). In general, the lack or absence of caspase-8 expression is often correlated with the resistance of neuroblastoma cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis. It has been proposed, however, that IFN-γ sensitizes cells to undergo apoptosis by increasing the endogenous expression of caspase-8. In light of this, we decided to examine whether IFN-γ can sensitize Paju cells to undergo apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that lack of caspase-8 expression in Paju cells and exposure of the cells to IFN-γ resulted in an increase of caspase-8 at 24 h; this expression level was sustained for at least 72 h after the treatment (Fig. 1c). However, no cleavage forms of caspase-8 were detected. The expression of downstream products of caspase-8, caspase-3, and DNA fragmentation factor 45 was not changed following the treatment with IFN-γ. Additionally, no activated forms of the caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation factor 45 were detected following the treatment. To further investigate whether IFN-γ sensitizes Paju cells to death receptor-induced apoptosis, cell death was measured after treatment with IFN-γ in combination with either Fas mAb or TRAIL. Cells were pretreated with IFN-γ for 24 h before the application of Fas mAb or TRAIL, and cell viability was assessed by the acid phosphatase assay 24 h later. Fas mAb or TRAIL either alone or in combination with IFN-γ failed to induce apoptosis in Paju cells (Fig. 1d). The activation of caspase-8 and casapse-3 was also analyzed by Western blotting. Treatment with IFN-γ alone or in combination with these ligands increased caspase-8 expression (Fig. 1d). However, these treatments failed to show cleavage forms of caspase-8 and caspase-3. These results indicate that IFN-γ is capable of restoring caspase-8 expression but not sufficient enough to induce apoptosis, implying that a number of factors may be involved in the resistance of neuroblastoma cells to apoptosis. IFN-γ Induces Neuronal Differentiation in Paju Cells—Surprisingly, treatment with IFN-γ induced neuronal differentiation in Paju cells as characterized by neurite outgrowth. Following treatment with IFN-γ, neurite outgrowths began to appear on day 1 (Fig. 2a). The increases in length and number of the neurites were rapid. On day 5 after IFN-γ treatment, extensive networks were formed by the neuritic processes and the cells had differentiated into nearly pure populations of human neuron-like cells. Neurofilament staining confirmed that these neuron-like cells expressed the marker typical of neurons (Fig. 2b). In contrast to IFN-γ, neither Fas mAb nor TRAIL treatment enhanced the neurite outgrowth in Paju cells. To investigate whether IFN-γ treatment causes the transition from proliferation to neuronal differentiation, Paju cells were exposed to IFN-γ for different periods of time, and cell proliferation was examined by analyzing changes in cell numbers. IFN-γ treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, and this inhibition was seen on day 1 (Fig. 2c). Treatment with Fas mAb also inhibited cell proliferation, but its inhibitory action was weaker than IFN-γ. Further, Fas mAb-mediated growth inhibition began 2 days after treatment. In contrast, treatment with TRAIL had no inhibitory effects on cell proliferation. The inhibitory actions of IFN-γ and Fas mAb on cell proliferation were also confirmed with cell viability assay (Fig. 2d). To confirm IFN-γ mediated transition of neuronal differentiation from proliferation, the effect of IFN-γ on cell cycle progression of Paju cells was examined. Results from flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining showed that cell cycle arrest occurred at G1 stage (Fig. 2e). Hence, these results indicate that IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation is initiated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and then differentiation proceeds as shown by neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2, a and b). IFN-γ-induced Neuronal Differentiation Requires p35-associated Cdk5 Activity—p35/Cdk5 has been shown to be essential for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and FasL-induced neuronal differentiation in animals (16.Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 17.Desbarats J. Birge R.B. Mimouni-Rongy M. Weinstein D.E. Palerme J.S. Newell M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether Cdk5-p35 plays a role in IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation of Paju cells. We first examined the expression of p35 and Cdk5 in Paju cells. Following treatment with IFN-γ, the level of p35 increased at 1 h and peaked at 5 h of IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 3a). The level of p35 then gradually decreased and returned to basal level on day 1 after IFN-γ treatment. However, the level of Cdk5 did not change significantly following the IFN-γ treatment. Subsequently, we examined the changes of Cdk5 activity following IFN-γ treatment. Cdk5-p35 complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdk5 antibody, and the activity of Cdk5 was assessed using histone H1 as a substrate (Fig. 3a). The activity of Cdk5 increased markedly after IFN-γ treatment, and this change paralleled the changes of p35. This observation is in agreement with previous findings that Cdk5 activity is absolutely dependent on its activator, p35 (15.Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 29-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 16.Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 22.Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). We then studied whether Cdk5 is involved in cell differentiation. Two series of experiments were carried out. First, we examined whether the transfection of dominant-negative Cdk5 gene (dn-Cdk5) into Paju cells blocks IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth. Treatment of the Paju cells with IFN-γ at 24 h after Cdk5 gene transfection resulted in an increase in neurite out-growth, whereas IFN-γ failed to induce neurite outgrowth in dn-Cdk5-transfected cells (Fig. 3, b and c). In the next set of experiments, we studied whether inhibition of Cdk5 expression can block cell differentiation. Cdk5 expression was suppressed using siRNA duplex targeting Cdk5 (siRNA-Cdk5). Transient transfection of siRNA-Cdk5 significantly reduced Cdk5 protein expression and inhibited its kinase activity (Fig. 3d). Similarly, IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth was also inhibited when Cdk5 expression was inhibited using siRNA-Cdk5 (Fig. 3e). In addition, we examined whether treatment of IFN-γ in combination with either Fas mAb or TRAIL can enhance cell differentiation. Results from this study showed that co-treatment with Fas mAb, but not TRAIL, enhanced IFN-γ-induced cell differentiation as evidenced by the occurrence of neurite out-growth (Fig. 3f). Western blotting analysis also showed p35 expression was higher following the combined treatment (IFN-γ and Fas mAb) than IFN-γ alone (data not shown). Treatment with Fas mAb or TRAIL alone did not cause an increase in p35 expression; these treatments also did not enhance neurite outgrowth. Therefore, we conclude that increased p35-Cdk5 kinase activity is required for IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation in Paju cells. ERK1/2-Egr1 Signaling Pathway Is Involved in IFN-γ-induced Neuronal Differentiation—In a previous study, sustained activation of ERK1/2 was shown to be necessary and sufficient for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth; up-regulation of p35 by sustained ERK1/2 activation is an essential component of this pathway (16.Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has also been shown that ERK1/2-induced up-regulation of p35 is mediated by transcription factor Egr1. To identify whether ERK1/2 activation also mediates IFN-γ-induced cell differentiation in Paju cells, we examined whether IFN-γ treatment in the present system resulted in the activation of ERK1/2 and Egr1 pathway. ERK1/2 kinases are activated through dual phosphorylation by MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) (23.Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses revealed that following IFN-γ treatment, robust phosphorylation of ERK1/2 p44/42 proteins starting at 15 min and peaking at 1 h was evident in Paju cells (Fig. 4a). The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 then appeared to decrease at 5 h, although it was still higher than the control samples. Egr1 could not be initially detected in the control samples. However, a significant increase was observed 1 h after IFN-γ treatment; a lower level of Egr1 was also seen at 3 and 5 h after treatment (Fig. 4a). We then studied whether ERK1/2 activation mediated IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation in Paju cells using several specific inhibitors: PD98059 (30 μm), a specific inhibitor of MAP-kinase kinase 1 (MEK1); U0126 (10 μm), a specific inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2; SB203580 (10 μm), a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. The Paju cells were treated with IFN-γ for 5 h in the presence or absence of each inhibitor, and then the cells were collected for Western blot analysis (Fig. 4b). Treatment with U0126 or PD98059 completely suppressed ERK1/2 phosphorylation and p35 expression (Fig. 4b). Alternatively, SB203580 treatment did not have a significant effect on the suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation or p35 expression (Fig. 4b). The decrease in the p35 level upon inhibition of ERK1/2 activity correlates with the changes in Cdk5 activity in Paju cells (Fig. 4c). Moreover, treatment with ERK1/2 inhibitors significantly blocked the neurite out-growth in Paju cells (Fig. 4d). We also examined Cdk5 down-stream Akt pathway (24.Li B.S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Zheng Y. Takahashi S. Zhang L. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35702-35709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Akt activation occurs through PI3K phosphorylation (25.Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). In Paju cells, Akt activation was constantly high either with or without IFN-γ treatment as seen in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4a). Treatment with LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, revealed cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, and pretreatment with a nontoxic concentration of 10 μg/ml LY294002 failed to prevent IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth and p35 up-regulation (Fig. 4b). Taken together, these results suggest that the ERK1/2-Egr1-p35-Cdk5 signaling pathway is required for neuronal differentiation induced by IFN-γ in Paju cells. Cytokines including TNFα superfamily death ligands (TNFα, FasL, and TRAIL) and IFN-γ have been shown to be involved in apoptotic death of the brain cells during traumatic and ischemic central nervous system injury (26.Qiu J. Whalen M.J. Lowenstein P. Fiskum G. Fahy B. Darwish R. Aarabi B. Yuan J. Moskowitz M.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3504-3511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Plunkett J.A. Yu C.G. Easton J.M. Bethea J.R. Yezierski R.P. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 168: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been shown that these cytokines may also play a significant role in neurogenesis (5.Wong G. Goldshmit Y. Turnley A.M. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 187: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28.DiProspero N.A. Meiners S. Geller H.M. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 148: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29.Wang C.X. Shuaib A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 67: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Fas and TRAIL have an ability to induce apoptosis; however, these cytokines also promote cell proliferation and differentiation (30.Lambert C. Landau A.M. Desbarats J. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31.Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar), which implies that the role of Fas and TRAIL in the central nervous system is the subject of controversy. Here we have demonstrated the effects of these cytokines on apoptosis in Paju cells. Treatment of Paju cells with Fas mAb or TRAIL failed to induce apoptosis. As shown here as well as in previous studies (32.Fulda S. Kufer M.U. Meyer E. van Valen F. Dockhorn-Dworniczak B. Debatin K.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5865-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 33.Yang X. Merchant M.S. Romero M.E. Tsokos M. Wexler L.H. Kontny U. Mackall C.L. Thiele C.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1122-1129PubMed Google Scholar), the inability of Fas and TRAIL to induce apoptosis may be attributed to the inefficient expression of caspase-8 in Paju cells (Fig. 1). IFN-γ has been shown to up-regulate death receptor expression and increase caspase-8 expression via the Stat1 pathway, thus increasing sensitivity to death receptor-mediated apoptosis (7.Fulda S. Debatin K.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2295-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although IFN-γ increased Fas receptor (but not DR4 and DR5) expression and restored caspase-8 expression in Paju cells (Fig. 1, a and d), the resistance of Paju cells to apoptosis was not reversed by co-treatment of IFN-γ in combination with either Fas mAb or TRAIL (Fig. 1, e and f). Thus, IFN-γ-modulated apoptosis seems to be cell type-specific in the nervous system, and additional mechanisms might be involved in the resistance of Paju cells to apoptotic death. In search of the resistant mechanism of Paju cells, we unexpectedly found that treatment with IFN-γ induced the cells to differentiate into a neuronal phenotype. It has been shown that the differentiating cells are much more resistant to apoptosis than the undifferentiated parent cells (34.Lombet A. Zujovic V. Kandouz M. Billardon C. Carvajal-Gonzalez S. Gompel A. Rostene W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1352-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35.Lasorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4711-4716PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps because of the activation of antiapoptotic systems including PI3K/Akt, ERK, and Bcl-2 family molecules. Similarly, Paju cells showed constant activation of PI3K/Akt during IFN-γ treatment, and treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 caused cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a). Therefore, Paju cells were insensitive to apoptosis, which may be the result of constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. Next we examined IFN-γ-mediated cell cycle changes because cell cycle arrest is often required for neuronal differentiation, which is regulated by Cdk inhibitors such as p15, p16, p21, and p27 that inhibit phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (36.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4313) Google Scholar). IFN-γ treatment led to growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, accompanied by a decrease in S-phase (Fig. 2). This proliferation inhibition may be correlated with occurrence of the neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2). These results are in agreement with previous observations that in many cell types the decision of cells to differentiate is often made in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and that the transition from proliferation to differentiation is an inversely correlated process at cell cycle exit (37.Zhu L. Skoultchi A.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We subsequently elucidated the signal pathway responsible for the IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation in Paju cells. Results from the present study indicate that treatment with IFN-γ up-regulated p35 expression, the neuron-specific activator for Cdk5, and thus activated Cdk5. p35-associated Cdk5 activation is required and sufficient for the IFN-γ-induced neuronal differentiation in Paju cells. As shown in Fig. 3, b–e, inhibition of Cdk5 activity by either transfection of siRNA-Cdk5 or dominant-negative Cdk5-expressing vector inhibited IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth. We further studied whether ERK-Egr1 pathway is necessary for IFN-γ-induced p35/Cdk5 activation. Results from Fig. 4 demonstrated that treatment of U0126 or PD98059 not only reduced p35 expression and inhibited Cdk5 activity but also blocked IFN-γ-induced neurite out-growth. Additionally, ERK1/2 activation resulted in the induction of Egr1, a member of a zinc finger transcription factor family that binds to the promoter region of p35 and induces p35 expression (16.Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Collectively, the present results thus suggest that IFN-γ-mediated p35-Cdk5 activity is implicated in neurogenesis but independent from the pro-apoptotic role of IFN-γ. In previous studies, the activation of ERK and up-regulation of p35 have been observed in NGF-induced neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells and also in Fas-induced neuronal differentiation in vivo (16.Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 17.Desbarats J. Birge R.B. Mimouni-Rongy M. Weinstein D.E. Palerme J.S. Newell M.K. Nat.

Chem. 2002; 277: 528-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These cytokines are also up-regulated during neuronal development and neurological diseases. Therefore, these observations, together with the present results, support the notion that IFN-γ-induced ERK1/2-dependent p35-Cdk5 activity may be implicated in neural regeneration in the nervous system.

This study examined the mechanisms of α-catenin degradation, the role of α-catenin in β-catenin signaling, and the physiological significance of α-catenin regulation of β-catenin signaling in articular chondrocytes. We found that both α- and β-catenin accumulated during dedifferentiation of chondrocytes by escaping from proteasomal degradation. β-Catenin degradation was ubiquitination-dependent, whereas α-catenin was proteasomally degraded in a ubiquitination-independent fashion. The accumulated α- and β-catenin existed as complexes in the cytosol and nucleus. The complex formation between α- and β-catenin blocked proteasomal degradation of α-catenin and also inhibited β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and the suppression of type II collagen expression associated with ectopic expression of β-catenin, the inhibition of proteasome, or Wnt signaling. Collectively, our results indicate that ubiquitin-independent degradation of α-catenin regulates β-catenin signaling and maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of articular chondrocytes.

The accumulated α- and β-catenin existed as complexes in the cytosol and nucleus. The complex formation between α- and β-catenin blocked proteasomal degradation of α-catenin and also inhibited β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and the suppression of type II collagen expression associated with ectopic expression of β-catenin, the inhibition of proteasome, or Wnt signaling. Collectively, our results indicate that ubiquitin-independent degradation of α-catenin regulates β-catenin signaling and maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of articular chondrocytes. β-Catenin interacts with cadherin to participate in cell-cell adhesion and regulates gene expression by acting as a transcriptional co-activator (1.Ben-Ze'ev A.

Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In the absence of extracellular stimuli, cytosolic β-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. However, extracellular stimuli, such as Wnt signaling, lead to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, escape of β-catenin from ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic degradation, and subsequent cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin (3.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). The accumulated β-catenin translocates into the nucleus in association with members of the T cell-factor (Tcf) 1The abbreviations used are: Tcf, T cell-factor; Lef, lymphoid-enhancer-factor; ALLnL, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal; ALLM, N-acetylleucyl-leucyl-methioninal; siRNA, small interference RNA; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; CBZ, carbamazepine; Suc, succinic acid; MCA, 3-methylcholanthrene./lymphoid-enhancer-factor (Lef) family of transcription factors, leading to stimulation or suppression of target gene transcription (2.Willert K.

As a transcriptional co-activator, β-catenin is involved in the regulation of several biological functions. Our group previously has shown that β-catenin regulates maintenance of differentiated phenotypes (4.Hwang S.-G. Ryu J.-H. Kim I.-C. Jho E.-H. Kim K. Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. J. Biol.

We have also shown that Wnt-7a causes dedifferentiation of chondrocytes characterized by suppression of type II collagen expression and the onset of type I collagen expression. Accumulation and stimulation of β-catenin transcriptional activity by Wnt-7a signaling is sufficient to cause chondrocyte dedifferentiation (4.Hwang S.-G. Ryu J.-H. Kim I.-C. Jho E.-H. Kim K.

Cadherins regulate the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in a cell adhesion-independent manner (7.Sadot E. Simcha I. Shtutman M. Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15339-15344Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 8.Stockinger A. Eger A. Wolf J. Beug H. Foisner R. J.

Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), whereas γ-catenin increases the turnover of β-catenin protein (10.Salomon D. Sacco P.A. Roy S.G. Simcha I. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The NEMO-like kinase does not regulate β-catenin stability but rather inhibits the interaction between DNA and the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex by phosphorylating Tcf/Lef proteins (11.Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). During cell-cell adhesion, α-catenin associates directly with β-catenin, acting to link cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton. However, α-catenin is localized not only to areas of cell-cell contact; it is also found in other parts of the cell, such as the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that it participates in the regulation of other cellular functions. Indeed, recent reports indicated that α-catenin inhibits β-catenin signaling in various cell types. For instance, when α-catenin is overexpressed in Xenopus embryo, Wnt signaling is inhibited through direct binding of α- and β-catenin (9.Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12.Sehgal R.N. Gumbiner B.M. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), perhaps due to the sequestration of β-catenin in the cytoplasm (9.Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating β-catenin signaling, the α-catenin protein is actively degraded in cadherin-deficient L cells in a proteasome-independent manner, although α-catenin contains the PEST sequence, which is a common target for rapid degradation by calpain- or proteasome-mediated proteolysis (13.Takahashi N. Ishihara S. Takada S. Tsukita S. Nagafuchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It appears likely that α-catenin regulates β-catenin signaling during various cellular processes. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the modulation of α-catenin protein stability and the physiological function of α-catenin regulation of β-catenin signaling remain to be elucidated. We, therefore, investigated the mechanisms of α-catenin degradation, the role of α-catenin in β-catenin signaling, and the physiological significance of α-catenin regulation of β-catenin signaling in articular chondrocytes. Reagents—The proteasome inhibitors, Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO (MG132) and N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLnL), and the calpain inhibitor, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methioninal (ALLM), were purchased from Sigma. The peptide caspase inhibitors, CBZ-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) and CBZ-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-DEVD-fmk), were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). The synthetic peptide substrate for proteasomes (Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA) was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratory Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Control- or Wnt-7a-conditioned medium were prepared as described previously by Hwang et al. (4.Hwang S.-G. Ryu J.-H. Kim I.-C. Jho E.-H. Kim K. Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26597-26604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), by culturing Wnt-expressing L929 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cell Culture—Individual articular chondrocytes were isolated from joint cartilage slices from 2-week-old New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (15.Kim S.-J. Kim H.-G. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G.

The cells were plated on culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. The medium was replaced every 2 days until the cultures were tested with the indicated pharmacological reagents in each experiment. A β-catenin-negative cell line, human mesothelioma cancer cell (H28), was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cell Fractionation—Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (5.Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear fractions were prepared by homogenizing chondrocytes in 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.9) containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). Following the addition of 0.6% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, the cells were incubated for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.9) containing 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (nuclear fraction) was stored at –70 °C until needed for further analyses. Construction and Transfection of Expression Vector—A cDNA for human α-catenin was prepared by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from HeLa cells with specific primers (sense, 5′-GGA AAT CCA TGA CTG CTG TCC ATG CAG GCA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGG GTA CCC CTT AGA TGC TGT CCA TAG CTT T-3′) designed to introduce EcoRI and KpnI restriction sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The resulting cDNA was cloned into pGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). The non-ubiquitinatable S37A β-catenin was constructed as described previously (5.Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Articular chondrocytes were transfected with expression vectors using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (17.Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H.

Knockdown of α-Catenin by siRNA—We examined three siRNAs to silence α-catenin in chondrocytes and found that one of them caused effective knockdown of α-catenin. Briefly, a 21-nucleotide sequence (5′-GGA CCT GCT TTC GGA GTA CAT-3′) within the coding region of rabbit α-catenin-(1038–1058) (accession number: AB193105) was selected according to the manufacturer's notes (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). Two complementary oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-GTA CCT CGG ACC TGC TTT CGG AGT ACA TTC AAG AGA TGT ACT CCG AAA GCA GGT CCT TTT TGG AAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAG GAC CTG CTT TCG GAG TAC ATC TCT TGAATG TAC TCC GAA AGC AGG TCC GAG-3′; bold characters indicate α-catenin mRNA targeting sequences, and italic characters indicate the hairpin loops) were synthesized chemically. A scrambled α-catenin siRNA (5′-GCT CGC CTA GGT CAG GTA TAT-3′) was used as a negative control, which shows no significant homology to known gene sequences and did not regulate α-catenin expression. Annealing of sense and antisense oligonucleotides (25 μm each) was performed in 0.15 m NaCl at 80 °C for 2 min and then maintained until the temperature reached 35 °C in a thermal unit. Annealed siRNA was ligated into Acc65I/HindIII-digested psiRNA-hH1GFP:zeo vector (InvivoGen). Transfection was carried out with Lipofectamine reagent as described above. β-Catenin Reporter Gene Assay—The transcriptional activity of the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex was determined using the previously described reporter gene assay (4.Hwang S.-G. Ryu J.-H. Kim I.-C. Jho E.-H. Kim K. Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26597-26604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5.Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H.

Briefly, cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of the Tcf/Lef reporter genes, TOPFlash (optimal Lef-binding site) or FOPFlash (mutated Lef-binding site) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and l μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test B, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and reverse-transcribed with MoMLV-RT (Invitrogen) as described previously (19.Kim S.-J. Hwang S.-G. Shin D.-Y. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The following primers and conditions were used for PCR: α-catenin (334-bp product), sense, 5′-AGG GAC CTG ATA TAC AAG CA-3′, and antisense, 5′-ATG TAC TCC GAA AGC AGG-3′, with an annealing temperature of 45 °C; β-catenin (518-bp product), sense, 5′-GAA AAT CCA GCG TGG ACA ATG GCT ACT C-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACC ATA ACT GCA GCC TTA TTA ACC-3′, with an annealing temperature of 52 °C; glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (299-bp product), sense, 5′-TCA CCA TCT TCC AGG AGC GA-3′, and antisense, 5′-CAC AAT GCC GAA GTG GTC GT-3′, with an annealing temperature of 50 °C. The primers were based on the sequences of the human α- and β-catenin genes. Sequencing of the resulting PCR products for rabbit α-catenin and β-catenin showed that these gene fragments were 90 and 94% homologous to human α- and β-catenin, respectively (data not shown). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The fixed cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with antibodies against α-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories) or β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The cells were washed, incubated with rhodamine- or fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min, and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Where indicated, green florescence protein (GFP)-labeled α-catenin was used to determine the localization of transfected α-catenin. Proteasome Activity Assay—Proteasome activity in the cell extracts was determined by fluorometric measurement of 4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amide release from a fluorogenic peptide substrate (Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA). Homogenized cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were used for determination of enzymatic activity. Proteins (30 μg) were mixed with 100 μl of assay mixture containing 100 μm fluorogenic peptide substrate in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then quenched with 200 μl of ethanol. Fluorescence was measured in a spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. Native Gel Electrophoresis and Fluorogenic Substrate Overlay—Native gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Mahaffey et al. (20.Mahaffey D. Yoo Y. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21205-21211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were analyzed on non-denaturing gels consisting of a 4.5% resolving gel and a 2.5% stacking gel; these were cast in 90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.6 mm borate, and 0.4 mm EDTA and run 4 °C for 700 V-h. After electrophoresis, the proteasome bands (20 S and 26 S) were identified by overlaying the gels with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KC1, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 100 μm fluorogenic peptide and then incubating the gels at 37 °C for 30 min. The 26 S proteasome bands were excised, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation—Chondrocytes were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and the supernatant (500 μg) was precleared with rabbit IgG and protein A-Sepharose for 1 h and then incubated with 1.5 μg of antibodies against α-catenin or β-catenin. The immunocomplexes were then precipitated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Western Blot Analysis—Chondrocytes were lysed on ice for 30 min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected using the following antibodies: monoclonal mouse anti-type II collagen (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin, -α-catenin, -γ-catenin, -pp120, -N-cadherin, and -ERK-1 (all from BD Transduction Laboratories) and goat polyclonal anti-actin and mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). For the detection of ubiquitin, membranes were sandwiched between several sheets of Whatman 3MM paper and submerged in deionized water, and membrane-bound ubiquitin was heat-activated by autoclaving for 30 min. Ubiquitin-independent Proteasomal Degradation of α-Catenin in Articular Chondrocytes—Based on previous reports that β-catenin levels were regulated by proteasomal degradation (3.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar), we first examined whether the proteasomal degradation pathway regulates α-catenin protein level in primary cultured articular chondrocytes. As expected, β-catenin protein levels were significantly increased by 26 S proteasome inhibitors (ALLnL and MG132) but not by caspase (Z-VAD-fmk and DEVD-fmk) or calpain (ALLM) inhibitors (Fig. 1A). Protein levels of α-catenin were also significantly increased by the inhibition of the 26 S proteasome (Fig. 1A), suggesting that both α- and β-catenins are degraded via proteasomal pathways. Treatment with a translation inhibitor (cycloheximide) reduced levels of α- and β-catenin; this reduction was blocked by the inhibition of the 26 S proteasome with MG132 (Fig. 1B), confirming that both α- and β-catenins are post-translationally regulated via the proteasomal degradation pathway. Post-translational regulation of α- and β-catenin was additionally supported by our observations that their transcript levels were not affected by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 1C). To characterize the proteasomal degradation of α-catenin, we next examined its physical association with the 26 S proteasome. For this purpose, chondrocytes were treated with ALLnL or MG132 to inhibit proteasome activity (Fig. 2A), and total cell lysates were separated by native gel electrophoresis. The 26 S proteasome band was identified by fluorogenic substrate overlay (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Proteins localized in the 26 S proteasome band were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting indicated that both α- and β-catenins were located in the 26 S proteasome fraction (Fig. 2B, lower panel), suggesting that α- and β-catenins may associate with the 26 S proteasome. Proteasome inhibition with ALLnL and MG132 caused accumulation of α- and β-catenins in a dose-(Fig. 2C) and time-(Fig. 2D) dependent manner. Accumulated β-catenin was detected in the gel as a ladder form consistent with ubiquitination (3.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we did not detect any electrophoretic mobility shift of α-catenin following proteasome inhibition (Fig. 2, C and D). Because the electrophoretic pattern of α-catenin suggested non-ubiquitination, we further tested for ubiquitination of α- and β-catenin by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2E, Western blot analysis indicated that β-catenin, but not α-catenin, was ubiquitinated in chondrocytes, suggesting that α-catenin is degraded by the 26 S proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent fashion. β-Catenin Inhibits α-Catenin Degradation—We next examined whether accumulation of α- and β-catenin proteins is associated with each other in chondrocytes. For this purpose, we first used immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis to determine the expression levels of α- and β-catenins in chondrocytes transfected with wild-type α-catenin or S37A β-catenin (which cannot be ubiquitinated due to the loss of its phosphorylation site). Double immunostaining of chondrocytes (Fig. 3A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B) revealed that cells overexpressing S37A β-catenin showed high levels of α-catenin protein, whereas overexpression of α-catenin did not affect β-catenin protein levels. Because the above results suggest that accumulation of α-catenin is associated with the observed increases in β-catenin protein levels, the association of α- and β-catenin accumulation was further characterized by uncoupling the degradation of α-catenin from that of β-catenin using a β-catenin-negative cell line (H28). As shown in Fig. 3C, α-catenin was accumulated in the β-catenin-negative cell line by the inhibition of proteasome, indicating that α-catenin degradation via the proteasomal pathway is independent of the existence of β-catenin protein. The role of β-catenin accumulation in α-catenin degradation was further examined by ectopic expression of S37A β-catenin in H28 cells. Ectopically expressed S37A β-catenin binds to endogenous α-catenin and caused the increase in α-catenin protein level (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the existence of β-catenin protein and its binding to α-catenin inhibit proteasomal degradation of α-catenin. This also suggests that the observed increase in α-catenin protein level in β-catenin-overexpressing chondrocytes is due to the inhibition of α-catenin degradation by β-catenin. The inhibitory role of β-catenin in α-catenin degradation was further examined by inducing β-catenin accumulation in chondrocytes. Consistent with our previous observations that accumulation of β-catenin and subsequent stimulation of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex transcriptional activity caused dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes (4.Hwang S.-G.

The accumulation of β-catenin is accompanied by the increase in α-catenin protein level (Fig. 4A). Transcript levels of α- and β-catenin and proteasome activity were not affected by the treatment of chondrocytes with Wnt-7a, LiCl, or interleukin-1β (Fig. 4D), suggesting post-translational regulation of α- and β-catenin protein levels. α-Catenin Inhibits β-Catenin Signaling and β-Catenin-mediated Dedifferentiation of Articular Chondrocytes—We next examined the functional significance of the proteasomal degradation of α-catenin in articular chondrocytes. First, we examined the intracellular localization of α- and β-catenins. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that α-catenin was localized throughout cells, whereas β-catenin was detected mainly at areas of cell-cell contact. However, when proteasome activity was blocked by MG132 treatment, levels of α- and β-catenins were significantly increased in the nucleus (Fig. 5A). Cell fractionation experiments indicated that following proteasome inhibition, accumulated α- and β-catenins were localized in both the cytosolic fraction and the nuclear fraction (Fig. 5B). Co-immunoprecipitation of α- and β-catenins suggested that these proteins exist as complexes in both the cytosolic and the nuclear fractions (Fig. 5C). The functional significance of α-catenin degradation by the proteasomal pathway was next examined in terms of its role in Wnt- and β-catenin signaling. As expected, accumulation of β-catenin following proteasome inhibition by MG132 led to stimulation of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity (Fig. 6A, left panel). β-Catenin accumulation also inhibited type II collagen expression (Fig. 6A, right panel), which is consistent with our previous observation (4.Hwang S.-G.

The significance of α-catenin accumulation and association with β-catenin was determined by overexpressing α-catenin followed by proteasome inhibition. As shown in Fig. 6B, ectopic expression of α-catenin blocked the MG132-induced increase of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and also significantly blocked the inhibition of type II collagen expression. The partial recovery of type II collagen expression (Fig. 6B) may be due to low α-catenin transfection efficiency, whereas the complete inhibition of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity could be due to our co-transfection of the reporter gene and α-catenin. Because the above results suggest that α-catenin may inhibit β-catenin signaling, the role of α-catenin in β-catenin signaling was directly examined by overexpressing α- and/or β-catenin. As shown in Fig. 7A, overexpression of α-catenin alone led to decreased basal levels of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity (Fig. 7A, upper panel) and increased type II collagen expression (Fig. 7A, lower panel). Ectopic expression of S37A β-catenin led to increased β-catenin transcriptional activity and suppression of type II collagen expression (Fig. 7B). Co-expression of α-catenin and S37A β-catenin blocked the S37A β-catenin-induced increase in β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex transcription activity and the inhibition of type II collagen expression (Fig. 7C), indicating that α-catenin inhibits β-catenin signaling and subsequent dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. The inhibitory action of α-catenin in β-catenin signaling was further confirmed by examining the role of α-catenin in Wnt signaling. Infection of cells with an adenovirus carrying Lef-1 (Fig. 8A) or treatment of cells with Wnt-7a-conditioned medium (Fig. 8B) led to increased β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity (left panels) and suppression of type II collagen expression (right panels). Ectopic expression of α-catenin blocked the increase of transcriptional activity and rescued type II collagen expression (Fig. 8), indicating that α-catenin inhibits Wnt signaling by disturbing the transcriptional activity of β-catenin.Fig. 8α-Catenin inhibits Wnt signaling and Wnt-induced inhibition of type II collagen expression.A, chondrocytes were transfected with empty vector (Control and Lef-1) or with a vector encoding α-catenin. Following incubation for 24 h, the cells were infected with empty adenovirus or with an adenovirus carrying Lef-1. The transcriptional activity of β-catenin was determined by reporter gene assay (left panel), and expression levels of α-catenin, β-catenin, type II collagen, and Lef-1 (determined with anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody) were determined by Western blotting (right panel). B, chondrocytes were transfected with empty vector or α-catenin expression vector. Following incubation for 24 h, the cells were treated with 200 μl of Wnt-7a-conditioned medium for 24 h. The transcriptional activity of β-catenin was determined by reporter gene assay (left panel), and expressions of α-catenin (determined with anti-GFP antibody), β-catenin, and type II collagen were determined by Western blotting (right panel). ERK was employed as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an attempt to elucidate the physiological significance of α-catenin degradation and its regulation of β-catenin signaling, we finally examined whether endogenous α-catenin can regulate β-catenin signaling and chondrocyte differentiation by using siRNA to knock down the endogenous α-catenin in chondrocytes. As shown in Fig. 9A, down-regulation of endogenous α-catenin increased the basal level of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity (left panel) and caused reduction in type II collagen expression level (right panel). Knockdown of α-catenin also increased Wnt-7a-induced activation of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and promoted the inhibition of type II collagen expression caused by Wnt-7a treatment (Fig. 9B). We previously showed that stimulation of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity by ectopic expression of β-catenin or Wnt-7a treatment caused dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes (4.Hwang S.-G.

Here, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of α-catenin degradation in articular chondrocytes and examined the role of α-catenin in β-catenin signaling and its physiological significance in chondrocyte differentiation. We found that α-catenin was actively degraded by a ubiquitin-independent proteasomal pathway and that accumulated α-catenin inhibited the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex, thereby blocking β-catenin- or Wnt-induced dedifferentiation of primary cultured articular chondrocytes. Ubiquitin-independent Proteasomal Degradation of α-Catenin—This is the first report that α-catenin is degraded via a proteasomal pathway, as evidenced by our observation that the inhibition of proteasome caused accumulation of α-catenin. This conclusion is further supported by our finding that α-catenin was associated with the proteasome fraction. Proteasomes play an essential role in the rapid elimination of short-lived key regulatory proteins. A major determinant for protein half-life is the presence of degradation signals, such as the ubiquitin fusion degradation signal, the PEST sequence, and the destruction box (2.Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that α-catenin, which contains a high quality PEST sequence (residues 633–651), was actively degraded in L cells (13.Takahashi N. Ishihara S. Takada S. Tsukita S. Nagafuchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the previous report found that various proteasome and calpain inhibitors did not affect the level of endogenous α-catenin proteins in L cells (13.Takahashi N. Ishihara S. Takada S. Tsukita S. Nagafuchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, under our experimental conditions, proteasome inhibition increased α-catenin protein levels not only in primary chondrocytes but also in HTB-94 chondrosarcoma, Balb/c, and NIH3T3 cells (data not shown), suggesting that proteasomal degradation of α-catenin is not restricted to primary cultured articular chondrocytes. Another interesting finding in this study is that α-catenin degradation is ubiquitination-independent. For typical proteasomal protein degradation, the rate-limiting step is the recruitment of the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3), which conjugates a polyubiquitin tree to the substrate (21.Dantuma N.P. Masucci M.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 26 S proteasomes preferentially degrade ubiquitinated proteins (22.Benaroudj N. Tarcsa E. Cascio P. Goldberg A.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, we did not detect any evidence for the ubiquitination of α-catenin in articular chondrocytes, which suggests that α-catenin is degraded via the 26 S proteasome in a ubiquitination-independent manner. This is not unheard of; several other proteins are degraded by proteasomes in a ubiquitination-independent fashion. For instance, ornithine decarboxylase is degraded by the 26 S proteasome via a ubiquitin-independent pathway (23.Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and this phenomenon is conserved between animals and fungi (24.Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Other proteins such as calmodulin, troponin C (22.Benaroudj N. Tarcsa E. Cascio P. Goldberg A.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and α-synuclein (25.Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) are also degraded by 26 S proteasomes without ubiquitination. The p53 protein can undergo proteasomal degradation by two alternative pathways; one is ubiquitin-dependent and regulated by Mdm-2, whereas the other is ubiquitin-independent and regulated by NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (26.Asher G. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13125-13130Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that ubiquitin-independent degradation by 26 S proteasomes may be more important than has generally been assumed. However, we do not yet know precisely how this occurs in the case of ubiquitin-independent degradation of α-catenin in chondrocytes. One possibility is that α-catenin degradation is dependent to the degradation of β-catenin and that ubiquitinated β-catenin accompanies α-catenin into proteasomal degradation. This is based on the observations that overexpression of S37A β-catenin or accumulation of β-catenin caused accumulation of α-catenin, whereas overexpression of α-catenin did not affect β-catenin accumulation. However, this is unlikely to happen in chondrocytes because α-catenin degradation is also observed in the β-catenin-negative cell line. Therefore, our experiments uncoupling the degradation of α-catenin from that of β-catenin using the β-catenin-negative cell line clearly indicate that α-catenin degradation is independent to the β-catenin degradation. Our results additionally indicate that accumulation of β-catenin inhibits degradation of α-catenin, as evidenced by the observation that ectopically expressed S37A β-catenin in β-catenin-negative cells binds to α-catenin and causes the increase in α-catenin protein level. This also explains the reason why the accumulation of β-catenin always causes accumulation of α-catenin in chondrocytes. α-Catenin Regulation of β-Catenin Signaling and Chondrocyte Differentiation—Our current results clearly indicated that α-catenin inhibits nuclear signaling of β-catenin and thereby blocks β-catenin- or Wnt-induced dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. The observations that 1) α-catenin inhibits β-catenin signaling and that 2) Wnt signaling increased not only β-catenin but also α-catenin levels appear to be paradoxical for the maximum effects of Wnt signaling, i.e. stimulation of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and resulting dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. However, our results suggested that the increase in α-catenin by Wnt signaling is to assure fine-tuning of the transcriptional activity of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex. This conclusion is based on the observations that 1) knockdown of endogenous α-catenin by siRNA increased the basal level of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and increased Wnt-7a-induced activation of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and 2) binding of α-catenin to β-catenin inhibited degradation of α-catenin and thereby inhibited β-catenin signaling. Our previous study (16.Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) indicated that chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells accompanied decreased expression of α- and β-catenin. We also reported that down-regulation of β-catenin is necessary for chondrogenesis and accumulation of β-catenin inhibited chondrogenesis by stabilizing cell-cell adhesion (5.Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, β-catenin inhibits chondrogenesis by acting as a cytoskeletal component, whereas it causes dedifferentiation of chondrocytes by acting as a transcriptional co-activator. Therefore, it is likely that down-regulation of both α- and β-catenin during chondrogenesis is necessary for the disruption of cell-cell adhesion, which is necessary for chondrocyte differentiation, and the increase of α-catenin during dedifferentiation is to assure fine-tuning of the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity. Consistent with our observations, several previous studies have indicated that the inhibition of β-catenin signaling by α-catenin occurs via direct binding to β-catenin (9.Simcha I. Shtutman M.

Cell Res. 2000; 255: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is thought that α-catenin overexpression inhibits β-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription by sequestering β-catenin in the cytoplasm (9.Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12.Sehgal R.N. Gumbiner B.M. Reichardt L.F. J.

Commun. 2000; 277: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, endogenous or exogenously expressed α-catenin is found in the nuclei of various cell types such as SW480, DLD-1, and Cos cells but not in the nuclei of HCT116 cells (14.Giannini A.L. Vivanco M. Kypta R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27.Giannini A.L. Vivanco M.M. Kypta R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reason for this differential nuclear localization of α-catenin is presently unknown but may suggest that β-catenin is not the only factor involved in nuclear localization of α-catenin. It was further demonstrated that α-catenin binding to β-catenin does not affect entry of α-catenin into the nucleus but rather inhibits the interaction of the β-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex with target DNA (27.Giannini A.L. Vivanco M.M. Kypta R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In articular chondrocytes, α- and β-catenin complexes are localized in both the cytosol and the nucleus, indicating that sequestration of β-catenin in the cytoplasm is not the mechanism by which β-catenin signaling is inhibited by α-catenin. Instead, it is more likely that association of α-catenin with β-catenin blocks their interaction with target DNA. However, this hypothesis will await further study. In summary, we have demonstrated that both α- and β-catenins are actively degraded by 26 S proteasomes in articular chondrocytes. The degradation of β-catenin is ubiquitination-dependent, whereas α-catenin is degraded independent of detectable ubiquitination. We also demonstrated that accumulated α-catenin associates with β-catenin, resulting in the inhibition of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and subsequent blockade of β-catenin- or Wnt-induced the inhibition of type II collagen expression. Our results collectively suggest that α-catenin functions in chondrocytes not only as a cytoskeletal component but also as a modulator of β-catenin signaling."

SRF is a member of an ancient DNA-binding protein family, which shares a highly conserved DNA binding/dimerization domain of 90 amino acids, termed the MADS box (7Schwarz-Sommer Z. Huijser P. Nacken W. Saedler H. Sommer H. Science. 1990; 250: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). SRF from human through yeast transcription factors MCM1 and ARG80 and several plant proteins, such as Deficiens, all have an evolutionarily conserved MADS box with similar DNA sequence binding specificity (8Hayes T.E. Sengupta P. Cochran B.H. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, SRF-related proteins (RSRF/MEF-2) constitute a subfamily of the MADS box family of transcription factors (9Martin J.F. Schwarz J.J. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 10Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). MEF-2 factors contain the MADS box and an adjacent MEF-2 box (10Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). MEF2 proteins bind to MEF-2 sites, CTA(A/T)4TAG, which can be found in the regulatory regions of both non-muscle and muscle-specific genes (10Pollock R. Treisman R.

Science. 1995; 267: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Despite their similarities, MADS box proteins have evolved to perform important biological functions such as specification of mating type in yeast (12Treisman R. Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), homeotic activities in plants (13Ma H. Yanofsky M.F. Meyerowitz E.M.

Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). SRF is a key regulator of immediate early gene expression, which frequently results in mitogenesis, and also of terminal muscle differentiation (3Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 16Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 17Reecy J.M.

SRF acts as a platform to interact with other regulatory proteins and ultimately the regulation of specific gene programs. For example, at the c-fos promoter, SRF recruits proteins having an Ets domain and forms ternary complexes through the B box region of the Ets protein (18Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The contiguous Ets DNA-binding site adjacent to the SRE and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of the B box stimulates SRF-dependent c-fos activity in replicating cells (19Dalgleish P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 560-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For the most part, Ets factor-dependent ternary complexes do not play a role in regulating SRF-dependent myogenic gene targets.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 812-822PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, high levels of SRF expression and increased SRF mass appeared to coincide with the expression of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle α-actins (19Dalgleish P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 560-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) noted as early markers for terminal striated and smooth muscle differentiation. The homologous recombinant knock-out of the murine SRF gene demonstrated a severe block for mesoderm formation during mouse embryogenesis (15Arenian S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). These very early lethal SRF-deficient embryos, which appear to have normal cell replication, also have a severe gastrulation defect and do not develop to term or express SRF-dependent genes. Currently, there are a limited number of direct SRF gene targets, which are regulated during the formation of the early cardiovascular mesoderm. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) was harnessed to explore regulatory networks in the developing cardiovascular mesoderm. ChIP assays have begun to reveal co-regulated groups of genes that share cis-regulatory elements that bind the same transfactors. The great advantage of combining global transcription factor binding analysis with expression profiling is that the direct targets of transcription factors can be distinguished from indirect downstream effects. ChIP is a powerful tool for elucidating in vivo DNA-protein interactions. Recently, ChIP has been used to identify the target genes of a variety of DNA-binding proteins from yeast to human, such as the Gal4 gene in yeast (27Ren B. Robert F. Wyrick J.J. Aparicio O. Jennings E.G. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Schreiber J. Hannett N. Kanin E. Volkert T.L. Wilson C.J. Bell S.P. Young R.A.

We developed a systematic nonbiased search for downstream sequence genes that may be directed through the SRF to capture genetic targets. A generic protocol was devised to purify the DNA fragments bound to SRF in vivo from the whole genome by Protein A-TEV-tagged Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (PATChIP). We used PATChIP technology to purify the DNA fragments bound in vivo to serum-response factors, and we identified 188 SRF-binding fragments and 92 contiguous genes as SRF targets. Here, we focused on 43 of these SRF-binding fragments that appear to play important roles in mesoderm formation and cardiovascular and muscle differentiation. Construction of the Protein A-tagged-TEV-SRF Expression Vectors— A DNA fragment containing a Kozak sequence, the two IgG binding units of protein A (ProtA), and TEV protease recognition sequences was amplified by PCR from pNOPPATAIL (32Lau E. Kunzler M. Braunwarth A. Hellmuth K. Podtelejnkov A. Mann M. Hurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 467-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and subcloned between the NheI and XbaI sites of a pcDNA3.1(-) myc-his (Invitrogen) to build a pcDNA-ProtA-TEV construct (N-terminal ProtA construct). The C-terminal ProtA construct, pcDNA-TEV-ProtA, was obtained by a ligation of three fragments. Fragment A (1.4 kb) is an ScaI-BamHI fragment of the pcDNA3.1(-) myc-his vector containing a partial ampicillin resistance gene and a cytomegalovirus promoter. Fragment B (4.4 kb) is a KpnI-ScaI fragment from pcDNA-ProtA-TEV. It consists of the two IgG binding units of ProtA, a poly(A), neomycin resistance gene, and a partial ampicillin resistance gene from the pcDNA-ProtA-TEV construct. Fragment C, containing BamHI, HpaI, and HindIII sites, the TEV protease recognition site, and a KpnI site, was obtained by annealing the following two synthesized oligonucleotides: 5′-GATCCACGTTAACAAAGCTTGAAAACCTGTATTTTCAGGGCTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGAGCCCTGAAATACAGGTTTTCAAGCTTTGTTAACGTG-3′. An XbaI-XbaI fragment containing the SRF gene from a pCGN-SRF construct was cloned into the XbaI site of the pcDNA-ProtA-TEV construct to obtain pN-ProtA-TEV-SRF. A similar cloning strategy was used to make a pC-SRF-TEV-ProtA construct. An XbaI-BamHI PCR product without stop codon from the pCG-SRF construct was ligated into XbaI and BamHI sites of pcDNA-TEV-ProtA. SRF-binding Fragment, Hsp68 Luciferase Construct—An 871-bp fragment from the HindIII to NcoI sites of the Hsp68-LacZ construct was subcloned into the HindIII and NcoI sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The SRF-binding fragments were cut with EcoRI and XhoI and then subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of the Hsp68 luciferase construct. Cell Culture, Transfection, Stable Line Selections, Differentiation, and Luciferase Assays—The P19 mouse EC cell line from the American Type Culture Collection was cultured in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Invitrogen; growth medium is DMEM with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5% normal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm non-essential amino acids according to Skerjanc (33Skerjanc I.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)). P19 cells were transfected with pN-ProtA-TEV-SRF, pC-SRF-TEV-ProtA, pcDNA-ProtA-TEV, or pcDNA-TEV-ProtA. Stable transfectants were selected with G418 and pooled in P19 cells. Several stable lines were obtained, including S18 (expressed the fusion protein, SRF N-tagged ProtA) and SM1 (expressed the SRF C-tagged ProtA). Another P19-ProtA stable line was also selected as control, in which the ProtA protein only was expressed. For differentiation, P19 cells, or S18, and SM1 stable lines were seeded in bacterial Petri dishes at 1 × 106 cells/dish; the cells grew and aggregated with differentiation medium (growth medium1% Me2SO) for 3–4 days. These aggregates were placed onto standard tissue culture plates with growth medium for another 3–4 days. For early differentiation, the cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde after 4 days in differentiation medium. For luciferase assays, the SRF-binding fragment Hsp68-luciferase constructs were co-transfected with the pCGN-SRF construct alone into CV-1 cells. After 48 h, the transfectants were harvested and lysed, and 20 μl of cell lysates was analyzed for luciferase activity as described previously. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Chen and Schwartz (20Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of extracts was estimated by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays used 5–10 μg of the nuclear extract prepared from transfected SRF null ES cells with expression vectors driving the Prot A-tagged SRF species. The nuclear extract was first incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1 μg of poly(dG-dC) in binding buffer (50 mm NaCl; 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5; 0.1 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; 10% glycerol). Specific c-fos SRE and nonspecific E box double-stranded oligonucleotides and anti-SRF antibodies were included in the reaction for competition and supershift assays, respectively. Subsequently, 0.01 pmol of the indicated end-labeled probe was added and incubated for a further 10 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel cast and autoradiographed. Purification and Cloning of SRF-binding Fragments—The following solutions for PATChIP were used: Cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm NaCl; 3 mm MgCl2; 0.1% Nonidet P-40); Nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mm EDTA; 1% SDS); IPP-150 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mm NaCl; 0.1% Nonidet P-40); TEV buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mm NaCl; 0.1% Nonidet P-40; 1 mm EDTA); IP buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, KOH; 150 mm KCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1% Triton X-100; 0.1% deoxycholic acid); High salt solution (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5; 500 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1% Triton X-100; 0.1% deoxycholic acid); LiCl solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 m LiCl; 0.02% SDS; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 0.5% deoxycholic acid); Elution buffer A (1% SDS; 0.1 m NaHCO3); and Elution buffer B (500 mm NaCl; 0.1 m NaHCO3). PATChIP, Strategy and Protocol—Protein-DNA complexes from SM1 or P19-proteinA cells were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20–30 min, and then glycines were added to stop the reaction at a final concentration of 0.125 m for 5 min. Cells were then washed two times with 1× PBS, harvested into a 15-ml tubes, and centrifuged at 700 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. After that the cell pellet was suspended in 1 ml of Cell lysis buffer on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10–15 min at 4 °C to pellet the nuclei. Isolated nuclei were suspended in 1 ml of Nuclei lysis buffer, incubated on ice for 10 min, and sonicated to fragment DNA with an average length of 200–400 bp. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g, the soluble chromatin was transferred to a 15-ml column and 12 ml of IPP-150 buffer, 300 μl of pre-activated IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added for incubation at 4 °C for 2 h. The Sepharose beads in the column were washed with 45 ml of ice-cold IPP-150 and then 10 ml of TEV buffer. To cleave the SRF-DNA complexes, Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 ml of TEV buffer with 100 units of TEV protease (Invitrogen) and were rocked gently at room temperature for 3 h or at 4 °C overnight. Then the SRF-DNA complexes were eluted into a new 1.5-ml microtube by gravity, and the Sepharose beads were washed with 1 ml of IP buffer. 100 μl of SRF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and pre-coupled protein G beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were added into the tube that contained the SRF-DNA complex eluates and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice each with IP buffer, once with high salt solution, LiCl solution, and TE at room temperature. 500 μl of elution buffer A was incubated with the beads, rotating at room temperature for 15–30 min. Harvested SRF-DNA complexes were carefully transferred into a new 1.5-ml tube and treated with 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 5 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for 2 h of incubation at 55 °C. 20 μlof 5 m NaCl was then added into the 500-μl eluate and incubated at 65 °C for overnight for reverse cross-links. SRF-binding fragments were purified by the Qiagen column (from Qiagen PCR purification kit), and 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, was added to recover the DNA. To check the quality of DNA from PATChIP, 2 μl of recovered DNA was used as the template to amplify the mouse cardiac actin and c-fos fragment by PCR with the specific primers for the cardiac actin and c-fos genes. Construction of SRF-binding Fragment Library, BLAST Searches of Genomic Sequences, and Determination of Putative Binding Motif for DNA-binding Proteins—To make the SRF-DNA binding fragment library, DNA was blunted by T4 DNA polymerase, phosphorylated by T4 kinase, and then cloned into the EcoRV site of Bluescript KSII vector. Individual clones were purified and sequenced. The genomic locus of each sequence was mapped by BLAST searches of Ensembl, UCSC, and Celera mouse genome server. MatInspector (www.genomatix.de) and TESS (www.cbil.upenn.edu) were used for searching the putative binding motif for DNA-binding proteins within each SRF-binding fragment. RNA Preparation, Probe Labeling and Microarray, and RT-PCR— Srf-/-, Srf+/-, and Srf+/+ (wild-type) ES cells (murine embryonic stem cells) were kept without feeder cells on gelatin-coated dishes in complete medium (DMEM) with 2 mm l-glutamine,100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml steptomycin, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15% fetal bovine serum, and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor. To initiate differentiation, ES cells were seeded and grown in monolayer fashion on gelatin-coated dishes and kept overnight in complete medium. The 1st day after seeding was counted as day 0 of differentiation. The medium was then replaced with complete medium without LIF. The medium was replaced every other day, and the cells were harvested at days 2, 4, 8, and 14. Total RNA was then isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen), and the RNA pellets were redissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate distilled H2O. According to the protocol of Affymetrix, two-cycle amplification by in vitro transcription, and antisense RNA was labeled with biotin. After fragmentation and hybridization to MOE430A chips, data were analyzed using Microarray Suite-5 and d-Chip software (34Gallardo T.D. Hammer R.E. Garry D.J. Genesis. 2003; 37: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription reaction was carried out with Superscript II and oligo(dT), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The following PCR primers are available upon request: α-Mhc, Nkx2-5, Gapdh, Srf, Raf1, Map4k4, Bicc1, Pax2, Map3k14, Az-2, Tnip2, Txnl2, Mapk10, Actc1, Myl3, Ppia, Lrp4, Hspg2, Sema3a, Myst4, Pgm2, Hif3α, Itga9, Asb5, Ski, Eya3, Hes6, E2F5, Npm1, Rbbp6, and Scyl1. RNA Probe Construction, Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization, and β-Galactosidase Staining—The RNA probe constructs were obtained by cloning the RT-PCR fragment of gene-specific primers into the EcoRV site of Bluescript KSII. Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed by the Robotic machine InsituPro (Intavis AG), and our detailed protocols are available upon request. Generation of Srf+/- LacZ mouse lines will be described elsewhere. Staged embryos from E 6.0 to E 10.5 were stained for β-galactosidase after fixation in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 60 min, were washed three times with 1× PBS containing 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and then stained in the reaction solution (10 mm ferrocyanide, 5 mm ferricyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) in dimethylformamide) at 37 °C overnight. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel and Western Blotting—A total of 1 × 107 cells were lysed on ice in RIPA (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 0.25% deoxycholic acid; 1% Triton X-100/ and protease inhibitor mixture). Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then subjected to Western blotting analysis. Generation of the PATChIP System in P19 Cells—We developed a protein A tag-based technology to recover transfactor-DNA complexes, as diagrammed in Fig. 1A. This flow chart shows the following strategy: (i) starts with formaldehyde chromatin cross-linking within stable transfected cells; (ii) chromatin sonication; (iii) retrieval of ProtA-tagged SRF chromatin fragments; (iv) reversal of formaldehyde cross-links; (v) subsequent formation of a library, and sequencing of potential targets; and (vi) the identification of potential SRF gene targets. First, P19 cells were chosen as a tractable biological system for retrieval of SRF gene targets, because P19 cells can differentiate into several cell types, including cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle (33Skerjanc I.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). P19 cells also naturally express endogenous SRF (Fig. 1B) and, when grown on a large scale, provide sufficient chromatin DNA for cloning after multiple steps of PATChIP purification. Second, the ProtA tag has been widely used for protein complex purification (35Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.-E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Prujin G. J.M. Stoeckline G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 36Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Nature. 2002; 145: 141-147Crossref Scopus (4008) Google Scholar) and modified to place a cleavable TEV site between the SRF coding region and the dual ProtA moiety. ProtA-TEV-SRF (N-tagged) and SRF-TEV-ProtA (C-tagged) constructs were stably transfected into P19 cells (Fig. 1B). Antibody blots of P19 cellular proteins on PAGE showed expression of heavier N′-tagged (cell line S18 and S15) and C′-tagged SRF species (cell line SM1) in comparison with wild type SRF expressed in control P19 cell lines (S10 and S12) only expressing endogenous SRF in the presence of ProtA. We did not observe any differences in forming DNA-binding complexes as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 1C) or their ability to be cleaved by TEV (Fig. 1D). Because a tag placed on the C′ terminus of a protein may still be preferable because of less interference with protein folding than with N′-terminal tags, studies were continued with the SRF-TEV-ProtA (C-tagged) P19 stable lines. P19 and stably transfected C-tagged SRF cell lines were then treated with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), aggregated, and then differentiated into cardiogenic cell types as shown by expression of specific cardiac marker genes, Nkx2-5 and α-MHC (Fig. 1E). Third, after formaldehyde cross-linking and sonication of the chromatin, SRF-DNA complexes were captured on IgG-Sepharose by high affinity binding of their ProtA tags (Fig. 1A, IIIa). Gentle elution of enriched SRF-DNA complexes, although leaving behind nonspecific bound complexes, was achieved by the incubation with TEV protease (Invitrogen), which cut the unique TEV site Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly (Fig. 1A, IIIc). To obtain greater enrichment of SRF-binding fragments, an additional step was used to immunoprecipitate the SRF-DNA complexes with SRF-specific antibody (Fig. 1A, IIId and IIIe). Finally, a pool of SRF-binding fragments were then filled in, blunt-ended, and ligated into Bluescript plasmid vectors to build an SRF-DNA target library. Samples were taken for quality control assays and were found to be enriched in cardiac α-actin promoter sequences over nonfractionated genomic DNA (data not shown). We sequenced 242 individual clones from the SRF-DNA target library, and we compared their sequences against the published mouse genome (that was assembled by December, 2002) by BLAST search engines of from the University of California, Santa Cruz (genome.ucsc.edu), Ensembl (Sanger Institute, www.ensembl.ori), and Celera (www.celera.com). A cloned fragment was validated as a potential SRF-DNA binding target, by the following three criteria. 1) The fragment must have 95% or greater identity to the sequence of C57/black mouse genome, because P19 cells were derived from a CH3 mouse. 2) The fragment must be located within 100 kb upstream or downstream of a gene, based on previous reports that some enhancers may reside 85 kb upstream of its promoter (37Blackwood E.M. Kadomaga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). 3) The fragment must contain at least one SRF-binding site as a CArG consensus sequence or a CArG-like box (CArGL), being off the consensus sequence by no more than 1 base (16Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows group assignment of the PATChIP cloned fragments, as SRF gene targets. Of the 242 cloned fragments, we found that 188 DNA clones (78%) contained at least a CArG or CArGL box, thus validating PATChIP technology as a highly efficient tool for retrieving SRF DNA-binding sites, as listed in Table I. In addition, 54 fragments that did not contain CArG boxes were also listed in Table I, in the event that they might also serve as indirect SRF targe"
https://openalex.org/W1979789359,"The lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1 (Lox-1) mediates the recognition and internalization of oxidatively modified low density lipoprotein by vascular endothelial cells. This interaction results in a number of pro-atherogenic cellular responses that probably play a significant role in the pathology of atherosclerosis. The 1.4 Å crystal structure of the extracellular C-type lectin-like domain of human Lox-1 reveals a heart-shaped homodimer with a ridge of six basic amino acids extending diagonally across the apolar top of Lox-1, a central hydrophobic tunnel that extends through the entire molecule, and an electrostatically neutral patch of 12 charged residues that resides next to the tunnel at each opening. Based on the arrangement of critical binding residues on the Lox-1 structure, we propose a binding mode for the recognition of modified low density lipoprotein and other Lox-1 ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2009175120,"In eukaryotic cells IQGAP1 binds to and alters the function of several proteins, including actin, E-cadherin, β-catenin, Cdc42, and Rac1. Yeast IQGAP1 homologues have an important role in cytoskeletal organization, suggesting that modulation of the cytoskeleton is a fundamental role of IQGAP1. Phosphorylation is a common mechanism by which cells regulate protein function. Here we demonstrate that endogenous IQGAP1 is highly phosphorylated in MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells. Moreover, incubation of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated phosphate incorporation into IQGAP1. By using mass spectrometry, Ser-1443 was identified as the major site phosphorylated on IQGAP1 in intact cells treated with PMA. Ser-1441 was also phosphorylated but to a lesser extent. In vitro analysis with purified proteins documented that IQGAP1 is a substrate for protein kinase Cϵ, which catalyzes phosphorylation on Ser-1443. Consistent with these findings, inhibition of cellular protein kinase C via bisindolymaleimide abrogated Ser-1443 phosphorylation in response to PMA. To elucidate the biological sequelae of phosphorylation, Ser-1441 and Ser-1443 were converted either to alanine, to create a nonphosphorylatable construct, or to glutamic acid and aspartic acid, respectively, to generate a phosphomimetic IQGAP1. Although overexpression of wild type IQGAP1 promoted neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, the nonphosphorylatable IQGAP1 S1441A/S1443A had no effect. In contrast, the S1441E/S1443D mutation markedly enhanced the ability of IQGAP1 to induce neurite outgrowth. Our data disclose that IQGAP1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites in intact cells and that phosphorylation of IQGAP1 will alter its ability to regulate the cytoskeleton of neuronal cells.

The cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells comprises several elements, including actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. Numerous proteins interact with the actin cytoskeleton and regulate its function. Major regulatory proteins include the Rho family GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42), myosin, the Ena/VASP family, Arp 2/3, profilin, β-catenin, and IQGAP1 (13.Winder S.J. Curr. Opin.

Phosphorylation is a major post-translational method for regulating protein function, including that of the cytoskeleton. The important role of phosphorylation as a component of the changes in the cytoskeleton produced by malignant transformation has been known for some time (18.Ben-Ze'ev A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 780: 197-212PubMed Google Scholar). More recent evidence reveals that phosphorylation is essential for Ena/VASP function in cell movement (19.Loureiro J.J. Rubinson D.A. Bear J.E.

In this work we demonstrate that endogenous IQGAP1 is highly phosphorylated in cells and that IQGAP1 is a target for protein kinase C (PKC). 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; MAP-2, microtubule-associated protein 2; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LC-ESMS, liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry. The specific phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometry, and point mutant constructs of IQGAP1 were generated. A phosphomimetic mutant of IQGAP1 dramatically enhanced its ability to promote neurite outgrowth, suggesting that IQGAP1 regulates the neuronal cytoskeleton in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Materials—PKC and PKCϵ were purchased from Promega and Panvera, respectively. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) was from Millipore. Tissue culture reagents and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies (9E10.2) were manufactured by Maine Biotechnology. The anti-IQGAP1 polyclonal antibody has been characterized previously (5.Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies for ECL detection were from Amersham Biosciences. Bisindolymaleimide was purchased from Calbiochem. 32Pi and [γ-32P]ATP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of standard analytical grade. IQGAP1 Plasmid Construction—Myc-tagged wild type IQGAP1 (amino acids 2–1657), IQGAP1-N (amino acids 2–863), and IQGAP1-C (amino acids 864–1657) in the pcDNA3 vector have been described previously (5.Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To perform site-directed mutagenesis, the C-terminal half of IQGAP1 was inserted into pBluescript KS to produce pBluescript-IQC. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). IQGAP1 S1441A/S1443A (amino acids 1441 and 1443, Ser to Ala) was generated using the primers 5′-CCTGACAAGATGAAAAAGGCAAAAGCTGTAAAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCCTTTACAGCTTTTGCCTTTTTCATCTTGTCAGG-3′ (mutated residues are in boldface and underlined). For IQGAP1 S1441E/S1443D (amino acids 1441 and 1443, Ser to Glu and Ser to Asp, respectively), the primers 5′-CCTGACAAGATGAAAAAGGAAAAAGATGTAAAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCCTTTACATCTTTTTC CTTTTTCATCTTGTCAGG-3′ were used. After mutagenesis, the ClaIXbaI fragment of pBluescript-IQC was re-inserted into pcDNA3 IQGAP1 from which the wild type IQGAP1 C-terminal region had been removed. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were purified with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. IQGAP1 constructs were tagged with tandem enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by digesting IQGAP1 in pcDNA3 with XbaI. After making a blunt end with T4 polymerase, partial digestion was performed with BamHI. The 5577-bp fragment was inserted into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) at the BglII-SmaI site. To enhance fluorescence, a second EGFP was added. pEGFP-IQGAP1 was digested with NheI and PacI. The NheI cleavage site was filled with T4 polymerase and inserted into pEGFP-IQGAP1 at a BsrGI-PacI site. The BsrGI site was also filled in with T4 polymerase. GST-IQGAP1 Fusion Constructs—The production of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs of full-length IQGAP1 (GST-IQGAP1) and the N- (GST-IQGAP1-N, amino acids 1–863) and C-terminal halves (GST-IQGAP1-C, amino acids 864–1657) has been described previously (5.Ho Y.D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). GST-IQGAP1-S1441A/S1443A was generated by excising the 928-bp Cla1-SpE1 fragment from pGEX4T-TEVIQGAP1 and replacing it with the same fragment from pcDNA3-IQGAP1-S1441A/S1443A. The constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated by glutathione-Sepharose essentially as described previously (5.Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells, HEK 293H cells, and N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. Where indicated, FBS was omitted (serum starvation). Phosphorylation of IQGAP1 in Intact Cells—MCF-7 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then washed once with phosphate-free and serum-free DMEM. Radiolabeling was performed by incubating a 100-mm plate of cells with 0.6 mCi of 32Pi in phosphate-free DMEM for 3 h at 37 °C. Induction was performed by adding PMA to a final concentration of 1 μm. (An equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide was used as control.) Where indicated, cells were preincubated with 1 μm bisindolymaleimide for 1 h prior to PMA stimulation. After incubating with PMA for 20 min at 37 °C, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors), followed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated as described previously (10.Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, after clarifying by centrifugation, samples were precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. Anti-IQGAP1 antibody was added, followed 2 h later with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 3 h. Samples were washed five times with lysis buffer, resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. Membranes were exposed to BioMax XAR (Eastman Kodak Co.) film for autoradiography. Subsequently, the same membranes were probed with anti-IQGAP1 antibodies to establish the identity of the phosphoproteins. Phosphorylation of the N- and C-terminal halves of IQGAP1 in intact cells was examined by separately transfecting these constructs into HEK 293H cells. Cells were treated essentially as described above, except lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody to isolate the transfected protein (the constructs are Myc-tagged). Samples for mass spectrometry were processed as described for full-length IQGAP1 above, but radioactivity was omitted. After immunoprecipitating endogenous IQGAP1 with anti-IQGAP1 antibody, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue. The IQGAP1 bands were excised and digested in situ with trypsin as described previously (25.Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by PKC and PKCϵ in Vitro—Phosphorylation of IQGAP1 purified from cells and GST-IQGAP1 was performed in vitro with pure PKC. GST-IQGAP1 was expressed in E. coli and isolated with glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (5.Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Endogenous IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated from serum-starved, unstimulated MCF-7 cells as described above, except cells were not incubated with 32Pi. Samples on glutathione-Sepharose (GST-IQGAP1) or protein A-Sepharose (endogenous IQGAP1) beads were washed twice in PKC assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.67 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and beads were resuspended in 100 μl of PKC buffer containing 8 μl of 6.25 mg/ml phosphatidylserine. After adding 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi), the reaction was initiated with 1 μl of PKC. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min with gentle agitation every 1 min. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE solubilization buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed, followed by transfer to PVDF and autoradiography. In vitro phosphorylation with PKCϵ was performed by incubating washed GST-IQGAP1, GST-IQGAP1-C, and GST-IQGAP1 S1441A/S1443A (all on glutathione-Sepharose beads) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20 mm MgCl2, 300 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 10 μm ATP, 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was initiated with 0.5 μl of PKCϵ. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min with gentle agitation every 1 min and processed as described above for PKC. Phosphorylation Site Analysis of IQGAP1—Phosphopeptide-specific LC-ESMS was performed as described (26.Zappacosta F. Huddleston M.J. Karcher R.L. Gelfand V.I. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 3221-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides from IQGAP1 were separated by capillary reversed phase HPLC using acetonitrile/water gradients flowing at 4 μl/min. Negative ion LC-ESMS using single ion monitoring for the phosphate-specific marker ions m/z 63 (PO2−) and m/z 79 (PO3−) was performed as described previously (27.Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Bean M.F. Carr S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) on a PESciex API III+ (Concord, Ontario, Canada) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Micromass nanoflow ion source as described above. The HPLC eluent was split post-column with 0.4–0.6 μl/min going to the mass spectrometer and the remainder being sent to a preparation line for manual fraction collection into PCR tubes. Fractions were immediately stored at -70 °C until needed for further analysis. Precursor ion scanning for m/z 79 was performed on a Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray source. One-half of each HPLC fraction collected in the experiment described above was made basic by adding 2 volumes of 50/50 methanol/water containing 10% ammonium hydroxide (30 weight %), and 1.5 μl was loaded into the nanospray needle for analysis. Spectra were acquired in the multichannel analyzer mode as described previously (28.Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Alternatively, precursor ion scanning for m/z 79 was performed online during LC-ESMS using a Sciex API 4000 triple quadrupole-linear ion trap (29.Hager J.W. Yves Le Blanc J.C. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 1056-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides from IQGAP1 were separated by nanobore (75 μm inner diameter) reversed phase HPLC using acetonitrile/water gradients flowing at 0.3 μl/min. A makeup flow of 0.3 μl/min acetonitrile was added post-column by means of a tee. The entire HPLC eluent was introduced into the mass spectrometer, which recorded a precursor scan from m/z 500 to 1500 every 3.8 s. Phosphorylated peptides were sequenced by nanobore LC-ESMS/MS on a micromass quadrupole time-of-flight. Tandem MS data were collected every 2 s on a single precursor or alternating between a set of predefined precursors. The precursor selection window was set to 3 Da. Neurite Outgrowth—N1E-115 cells in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum were plated out at 1.2 × 105 cells per 3-cm dish on laminin-coated coverslips, and the following day the cells were transfected with wild type and mutant IQGAP1 cDNA constructs in Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 4 h as described previously (30.Hall C. Michael G.J. Cann N. Ferrari G. Teo M. Jacobs T. Monfries C. Lim L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5191-5202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM, 5% fetal calf serum for a further 18 h, fixed, and stained. Cells bearing neurites greater than 1 cell diameter were counted. Hippocampal Neuron Cultures—Rat E17 hippocampal neurons were isolated essentially as described previously (31.Bartlett W.P. Banker G.A. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 1944-1953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in neurobasal media, B-27 supplement 1/50, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 0.06 mg/ml cysteine (Sigma), and 1% antimycotic antibiotic (Invitrogen) for 24–48 h. Neurons were fixed and stained with antibodies against IQGAP1 and MAP-2. Staining with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin was also performed to visualize F-actin. IQGAP1 Is a Phosphoprotein—Phosphorylation is a fundamental post-translational mechanism for regulating protein function. IQGAP1 contains numerous theoretical phosphorylation sites for several different protein kinases. To determine whether human IQGAP1 is phosphorylated in cells, we isolated IQGAP1 from MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells by calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography and SDS-PAGE. A Coomassie Blue-stained IQGAP1 band was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin. A small aliquot of the sample was analyzed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (25.Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) to establish the protein as IQGAP1. The remaining sample was analyzed for phosphorylation content by using a phosphopeptide-specific liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry technique in which the mass spectrometer detects phosphate released from phosphopeptides undergoing collision-induced dissociation in the ion source (26.Zappacosta F. Huddleston M.J. Karcher R.L. Gelfand V.I. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 3221-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32.Verma R. Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Carr S.A. Reynard G. Deshaies R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that endogenous IQGAP1 is phosphorylated on multiple sites in intact cells (Fig. 1). Phorbol Esters Promote IQGAP1 Phosphorylation in Intact Cells—In silico analysis revealed that IQGAP1 has multiple consensus sequences for protein kinases, including CK2, protein kinase A, and PKC. Therefore, to determine whether basal phosphorylation could be augmented, MCF-7 cells were loaded with 32Pi and incubated with vehicle or phorbol ester, which activates PKC. When cells were serum-starved, minimal 32Pi was incorporated into IQGAP1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, incubation for 20 min with PMA induced robust phosphorylation of endogenous IQGAP1 (Fig. 2A). Probing the blot with anti-IQGAP1 antibody verified that the phosphoprotein was IQGAP1 and that the amount of IQGAP1 was not increased in the PMA-treated sample. To determine which region of IQGAP1 is phosphorylated, we separately transfected the N- and C-terminal halves of IQGAP1 into cells. Serum-starved cells were radiolabeled and incubated with PMA. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody to isolate the transfected constructs. Autoradiography revealed that 32Pi was incorporated exclusively into the C-terminal half of IQGAP1; the N-terminal half was not phosphorylated (Fig. 2B). Western blotting revealed that the N- and C-terminal halves were present at equivalent levels. Identification of PMA-stimulated Sites of Phosphorylation on Endogenous IQGAP1—To identify specifically where endogenous IQGAP1 is phosphorylated in response to phorbol ester treatment, we performed mass spectrometry. Serum-starved MCF-7 cells were incubated with vehicle or PMA in the absence of 32Pi. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IQGAP1 antibody and purified by SDS-PAGE. After in situ tryptic digestion of the bands corresponding to IQGAP1, the samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Phosphopeptide-specific LC-ESMS (Fig. 3A) showed that serum starvation drastically reduced the level of phosphorylation of endogenous IQGAP1 (compare Fig. 3A, gray trace, to Fig. 1). Following treatment with phorbol ester (Fig. 3A, black outline trace), four new phosphopeptides peaks were present. Precursor ion scanning MS on the fractions (for example see Fig. 3B) containing these four peaks yielded three phosphopeptide molecular weights 1785.4, 1913.4, and 700.2, which were tentatively assigned to IQGAP1 amino acid sequences 1441–1455, 1440–1455 or 1441–1456, and 1438–1442, respectively (Fig. 3D). LC-ESMS-based peptide sequencing of the triply charged ion (m/z 596.0) from the 1785-Da phosphopeptide (Fig. 3, C and D) confirmed the sequence as 1441SKSVKEDSNLTLQEK1455. LC-ESMS-based sequencing of the 1913-Da phosphopeptide revealed two peptides with the sequences 1441–1456 and 1440–1455. The sequencing data for all three of these peptides conclusively identified Ser-1443 as the major site of phosphorylation. However, we were not able to rule out that a fraction of these sequences might be phosphorylated on Ser-1441. Supporting the notion that this serine was modified was the tentative assignment of the 700-Da phosphopeptide to the sequence 1438MKKSK1442. This peptide would be produced efficiently only if Ser-1443 were not phosphorylated, thus allowing trypsin to cleave at Lys-1442 but not at Lys-1440 and Lys-1439. The relative abundance of the 700-Da phosphopeptide was rather low, suggesting either that this site is phosphorylated at low stoichiometry or that the peptide does not ionize well. We were not able to produce any direct sequencing data on this peptide. We could find no evidence for a peptide with phosphorylation at both Ser-1441 and Ser-1443. To confirm that IQGAP1 is a direct substrate for PKC in cells, we preincubated serum-starved MCF-7 cells with or without the selective PKC inhibitor bisindolymaleimide (33.Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h and then stimulated the cells with phorbol esters. Phosphorylation-dependent LC-ESMS using full time precursor ion scanning on IQGAP1 from PMA-stimulated cells showed that the PKC inhibitor completely abolished phosphorylation on Ser-1443 (Fig. 4, bottom trace). In the absence of inhibitor, the IQGAP1 phosphorylation profile was as expected (Fig. 4, top trace). IQGAP1 Is a Substrate for PKC in Vitro—PMA is widely used to activate PKC in cells. Therefore, we set out to determine whether IQGAP1 is a direct substrate for PKC. We first demonstrated that pure PKC catalyzed the phosphorylation of IQGAP1 in vitro. Incubation of IQGAP1 immunoprecipitated from serum-starved MCF-7 cells with PKC in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP resulted in phosphorylation of IQGAP1 (Fig. 5A, lane 1). Although unlikely, it is possible that the radioactivity detected is a consequence of exchange of 32P with phosphate on IQGAP1. In order to eliminate this possibility, we repeated the assay using GST-IQGAP1. The GST-IQGAP1 was expressed in E. coli, thereby ensuring that the protein was not phosphorylated. As was observed with IQGAP1 isolated from cells, PKC catalyzed the phosphorylation of GST-IQGAP1 (Fig. 5A, lane 2). In addition, when phosphatidylserine (data not shown) or PKC (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4) was omitted from the reaction mixture, no phosphate was incorporated into IQGAP1. Western blotting showed that the amount"
https://openalex.org/W2079520339,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein whose transcript undergoes complex regulated splicing in the mammalian nervous system. Exon 2 modulates the tau N-terminal domain, which interacts with the axonal membrane. Exon 10 codes for a microtubule binding domain, increasing the affinity of tau for microtubules. Both exons are excluded from fetal brain, but their default behavior is inclusion, suggesting that silencers are involved in their regulation. Exon 2 is significantly reduced in myotonic dystrophy type 1, whose symptoms include dementia. Mutations that affect exon 10 splicing cause frontotemporal dementia (FTDP). In this study, we investigated three regulators of exon 2 and 10 splicing: serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins SRp55, SRp30c, and htra2β1. The first two inhibit both exons; htra2β1 inhibits exon 2 but activates exon 10. By deletion analysis, we identified splicing silencers located at the 5′ end of each exon. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SRp30c and SRp55 bind to both silencers and to each other. In exon 2, htra2β1 binds to the inhibitory heterodimer through its RS1 domain but not to exon 2, whereas in exon 10 the heterodimer may sterically interfere with htra2β1 binding to a purine-rich enhancer (defined by FTDP mutation E10-Δ5 = Δ280K) directly downstream of the silencer. Increased exon 10 inclusion in FTDP mutant ENH (N279K) may arise from abolishing SRp30c binding. Also, htra2β3, a naturally occurring variant of htra2β1, no longer inhibits exon 2 splicing but can partially rescue splicing of exon 10 in FTDP mutation E10-Δ5. This work provides interesting insights into the splicing regulation of the tau gene. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein whose transcript undergoes complex regulated splicing in the mammalian nervous system. Exon 2 modulates the tau N-terminal domain, which interacts with the axonal membrane. Exon 10 codes for a microtubule binding domain, increasing the affinity of tau for microtubules. Both exons are excluded from fetal brain, but their default behavior is inclusion, suggesting that silencers are involved in their regulation. Exon 2 is significantly reduced in myotonic dystrophy type 1, whose symptoms include dementia. Mutations that affect exon 10 splicing cause frontotemporal dementia (FTDP). In this study, we investigated three regulators of exon 2 and 10 splicing: serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins SRp55, SRp30c, and htra2β1. The first two inhibit both exons; htra2β1 inhibits exon 2 but activates exon 10. By deletion analysis, we identified splicing silencers located at the 5′ end of each exon. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SRp30c and SRp55 bind to both silencers and to each other. In exon 2, htra2β1 binds to the inhibitory heterodimer through its RS1 domain but not to exon 2, whereas in exon 10 the heterodimer may sterically interfere with htra2β1 binding to a purine-rich enhancer (defined by FTDP mutation E10-Δ5 = Δ280K) directly downstream of the silencer. Increased exon 10 inclusion in FTDP mutant ENH (N279K) may arise from abolishing SRp30c binding. Also, htra2β3, a naturally occurring variant of htra2β1, no longer inhibits exon 2 splicing but can partially rescue splicing of exon 10 in FTDP mutation E10-Δ5. This work provides interesting insights into the splicing regulation of the tau gene. Alternative splicing is a versatile and widespread mechanism for generating multiple mRNAs from a single transcript (1.Grabowski P.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2.Graveley B.R. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Splicing choices are spatially and temporally regulated, and the ensuing mRNAs produce functionally diverse proteins, contributing significantly to proteomic complexity (2.Graveley B.R. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 3.Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar). Splicing is carried out by the spliceosome, a large and dynamic complex of proteins and small RNAs (4.Stamm S. Ben-Ari S. Rafalska I. Tang Y. Zhang Z. Toiber D. Thanaraj T.A. Soreq H. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 344: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 5.Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). A major question in splicing, and an obvious point of regulation, is how the spliceosome recognizes authentic splicing sites. The rules governing splice site selection are not fully understood; combinatorial control and “weighing” of splice element strength are used to enable precise recognition of the short and degenerate splice sites (6.Smith C.W. Valcárcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Despite the high fidelity of exon recognition in vivo, it is currently impossible to accurately predict alternative exons (7.Thanaraj T.A. Stamm S. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2003; 31: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Exonic and intronic enhancers and silencers are involved in splicing regulation (8.Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 9.Cartegni L. Wang J. Zhu Z. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3568-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Their mutation can result in human disease by causing aberrant splicing (10.Faustino N.A. Cooper T.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 419-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 11.Stoilov P. Meshorer E. Gencheva M. Glick D. Soreq H. Stamm S. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 803-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the trans side of regulation, mammalian splicing regulators mostly belong to two superfamilies, the serine/argininerich (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, serine/arginine-rich; hnRNP, heterogeneous ribonuclear protein; RRM, RNA recognition motif; RS, arginine/serine-rich; FTDP, frontotemporal dementia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription. proteins and the heterogeneous ribonuclear proteins (hnRNPs), neither of which is exclusively involved in alternative splicing (12.Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 13.Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The former are also components of the spliceosome, whereas the latter are also involved in pre-mRNA transport, RNA stability, and translational regulation. Several mammalian splicing factors are enhanced in or restricted to neurons, among them htra2β3, a splicing variant of htra2β1 (14.Nayler O. Cap C. Stamm S. Genomics. 1998; 53: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it appears that the exquisite calibration of mammalian alternative splicing is primarily achieved by SR and hnRNP proteins, which show distinct tissue and developmental ratios, despite their ubiquitous distribution (15.Hanamura A. Cáceres J.F. Mayeda A. Franza Jr., B.R. Krainer A.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 430-444PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Kamma H. Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Tau is a microtubule-associated protein enriched in axons of mature and growing neurons (17.Kempf M. Clement A. Faissner A. Lee G. Brandt R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5583-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it is also found in other cell compartments and types (18.Andreadis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated, microtubule-dissociated tau protein is the major component of neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases (18.Andreadis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 19.Ingram E.M. Spillantini M.G. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The tau gene produces three transcripts that undergo complex alternative splicing: 6 of the 16 tau exons are regulated cassettes (18.Andreadis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the tau protein interacts with the plasma membrane (20.Brandt R. Léger J. Lee G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The structure and function of the tau N terminus are modulated by cassette exons 2 and 3. The C terminus of the tau protein contains four imperfect repeats (encoded by exons 9–12) that act as microtubule binding domains (21.Lee G. Neve R.L. Kosik K.S. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1615-1624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Exons 2 and 10 are adult-specific in rodents and humans but with a crucial difference relevant to neurodegeneration: in adult rodents, exon 2 remains regulated, but exon 10 becomes constitutive (22.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar, 23.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J.

Neuron. 1989; 2: 1389-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In contrast, in adult humans exon 10, like exon 2, remains regulated in the central nervous system (23.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 25.Gao Q.S. Memmott J. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Screaton G. Andreadis A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The difference most likely arises from the details of the cis sequences flanking exon 10 in various organisms (26.Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J. Lewis J. Prihar G. Pickering-Brown S. Duff K. Hutton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15134-15143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 27.Wang J. Gao Q.S. Wang Y. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Andreadis A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1078-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which in turn affect the regulation exerted by trans factors. Altered splicing factor ratios suppress exon 2 splicing in myotonic dystrophy type 1, a multisystemic disorder whose symptoms include dementia (28.Sergeant N. Sablonniere B. Schraen-Maschke S. Ghestem A. Maurage C.A. Wattez A. Vermersch P. Delacourte A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2143-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Altered splicing regulation of tau exon 10 can cause inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTDP) with Parkinsonism (17.Kempf M. Clement A. Faissner A. Lee G. Brandt R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5583-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), almost certainly by disturbing the normal tau isoform ratio (18.Andreadis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 19.Ingram E.M. Spillantini M.G. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, the splicing regulation of these two exons is directly relevant to neurodegeneration. Both exons show a splicing default pattern of inclusion (25.Gao Q.S. Memmott J. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Screaton G. Andreadis A. J.

In this report we show that these two tau exons are partially regulated by exonic silencers located at their respective 5′ ends, which bind splicing factors SRp30c and SRp55. A third factor, htra2β1, acts in opposite fashion on the two exons: it inhibits exon 2 by binding to the SRp30c·SRp55 heterodimer through its RS1 domain but activates exon 10 by binding to an exonic enhancer located directly downstream of the silencer that recognizes the SRp30c·SRp55 heterodimer. In the case of exon 10, htra2β1 and the SRp30c·SRp55 complex may sterically interfere with each other. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The starting constructs were SP/2L (Fig. 1A) and SP/10L (Fig. 1C), in which tau genomic fragments are inserted in vector pSPL3 (Invitrogen). SP/2L contains tau exon 2 and 1 kilobase pair of the upstream and downstream native introns flanking exon 2 (30.Li K. Arikan M.C. Andreadis A. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Construct SP/10L contains tau exon 10, 471 bp of its upstream intron, and 408 bp of its downstream intron (27.Wang J. Gao Q.S. Wang Y. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Andreadis A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1078-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Using directed mutagenesis, as previously described (27.Wang J. Gao Q.S. Wang Y. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Andreadis A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1078-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30.Li K. Arikan M.C. Andreadis A. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we created nine deletions that scan exon 2 in SP/2L (E2-Δ1 to E2-Δ9; Fig. 1A) and three deletions and a double point mutation in exon 10 (E10-Δ2/3/4, E10-Δ8/9, and E10-Δ15, following the nomenclature of D'Souza and Schellenberg (32.D'Souza I.

Orecchio L.D. Bakalis S. Neve R.L. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1389-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar)). The mutations are diagrammed in Fig. 1, A and C, and the mutagenic primers are listed in Table I. The deletions were verified by PCR (using primers 2PCS and HTI2 for exon 2 and primers HT10PS and HT10N90 for exon 10; Table I) and by sequencing.Table IPrimers used in PCR For creation of deletions and point mutations, we used pairs of these primers and their reverse complements (not shown).

Reed R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). E10+30 contains all of tau exon 10 and 30 nucleotides of its downstream intron inserted into vector pGEM-TE (Promega). We also made deletions E2-Δ1, E2-Δ2, and E2-Δ4 (Fig. 1A) in81+2PCS/2PCN and deletion E10-Δ3/4 (Fig. 1C) inE10+30. Protein Expression in Cells and Bacteria and GST Pull-down Assays—For eukaryotic expression, cDNAs were expressed from the following promoters: cytomegalovirus (CMV) for htra2β1, SRp30c, SRp55, and the variants of htra2β1 and SRp30c (14.Nayler O. Cap C. Stamm S. Genomics. 1998; 53: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40.Cáceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 823-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots show that the factor variants express stable proteins in equivalent amounts (data not shown). For protein interactions in vitro, htra2β1 and SRp55 were cloned into pGEX-4T1 and pGEX-4T3, respectively (Amersham Biosciences). SRp30c (a generous gift from Dr. Chris Lorson) was in vector pRSET-c (Invitrogen). The recombinant proteins were produced and purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Stratagene) according to the vendor's instructions. For protein and RNA pull-downs, htra2β1 and SRp55 were cloned into pFLAG-CMV-6c, and SRp30c was cloned into pFLAG-CMV-6b (Sigma). Protein expression was verified by using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) on Western blots of crude lysates from cells transfected with each construct. 1 μl of a GST-factor fusion or GST alone was incubated with 1 μl of SRp30c-His or with 1 μl of htra2β1-FLAG in 0.5 ml of loading buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 10 μl (bed volume) of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of wash buffer (0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). The retained proteins were run on 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mouse monoclonal antibodies as primary antibodies (anti-His (Invitrogen) at 1:3000 or anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) at 1:2500) and goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:10,000 as secondary antibody. Cell Culture, Transfections, and RNA Preparation—Monkey kidney (COS) and human epithelial (HeLa) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmid DNA was prepared by Qiagen Tip-50s and introduced into cells by lipofection (LT1; Panvera). Total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). Reverse Transcription and PCRs—We performed PCR analysis of RNA as previously described (30.Li K. Arikan M.C. Andreadis A. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with primer pair SPL-LS/SPL-LN or SVP2/SPL-LN (Table I). The isoform ratio was calculated by scanning the bands from three independent transfections using the One-Dscan program and the Scanalytics IPLab software. Riboprobe Generation, UV-cross-linking, and RNA-protein Immunoprecipitation—We transcribed 81+2PCS/2PCN, E10+30, and their variants in vitro using the Promega transcription kit, [32P]CTP, [32P]UTP, or both (Amersham Biosciences) and RNA polymerase T3 and T7, respectively (Promega). For UV-cross-linking, exon 2 riboprobes and GST fusions of htra2β1, SRp30c, and SRp55 were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, and 1 μg of tRNA). Reaction mixtures were pre-chilled on ice and irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 10 min. The samples were digested with RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h and run on 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. For RNA pull-downs, equal counts of the riboprobes were added to lysates from HeLa cells transfected with htra2β1, SRp30c, and SRp55 FLAG fusions. The vectors were used as negative controls. We immunoprecipitated the proteins using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody conjugated with agarose (Sigma) according to the Novagen instructions and counted the radioactivity of the precipitated pellet in a beta scintillation counter. Scanning of Exon 2 by Deletions Uncovers an Exonic Silencer—Because the default behavior of exon 2 and 10 is inclusion (25.Gao Q.S. Memmott J. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Screaton G. Andreadis A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29.Andreadis A. Broderick J.A. Kosik K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3585-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the most likely explanation for their exclusion in fetal brain (18.Andreadis A. Biochim. Biophys.

In our previous work we found one weak silencer within exon 2 by point mutagenesis (30.Li K. Arikan M.C. Andreadis A. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, this element is context-specific and is not influenced by factors that strongly inhibit exon 2 splicing (30.Li K. Arikan M.C. Andreadis A. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that the point mutation may strengthen an enhancer rather than disrupt a silencer. In this study, we decided to employ a strategy used successfully for tau exon 10 (37.Jiang Z. Tang H. Havlioglu N. Zhang X. Stamm S. Yan R. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 38.Kondo S. Yamamoto N. Murakami T. Okumura M. Mayeda A. Imaizumi K. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) by creating nine deletions that scan exon 2 (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows the splicing behavior of the nine deletions. Two (E2-Δ7 and E2-Δ8) leave exon 2 splicing essentially unchanged. Four (E2-Δ3, E2-Δ5, E2-Δ6, and E2-Δ9) show a significant decrease of exon 2 inclusion, and one (E2-Δ4) shows a moderate decrease of exon 2 inclusion, suggesting that these deletions excise exonic enhancers; E2-Δ4 and E2-Δ5 partly overlap an enhancer previously defined by a point mutation (E2–6, shown in Fig. 1A) (30.Li K. Arikan M.C. Andreadis A. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, two (E2-Δ1 and E2-Δ2) increase exon 2 inclusion, indicating that the first ∼20 residues of exon 2 act as a silencer. In the case of exon 10, we found that the regions defined by E10-Δ2/3/4, E10-Δ8/9, and E10-Δ15 act as splicing silencers (Fig. 2C, lanes 3, 5, and 7; Fig. 2D, lane 3), in agreement with previous reports (26.Grover A.

Conversely, mutant M280 defines an enhancer (Fig. 4E, lane 1). This mutant is the obverse of mutant ENH (N279K) that extends a purine-rich region that binds htra2β1 (27.Wang J. Gao Q.S. Wang Y.

Deletion E10-Δ5 (also denoted Δ280K) overlaps mutation M280 and almost completely abolishes exon 10 splicing (27.Wang J. Gao Q.S. Wang Y. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Andreadis A. J.

We believe that inclusion of exon 10 in the M280 mutant would be even lower in the absence of the compensating M3 mutation, which affects a silencer (26.Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J.

https://openalex.org/W2090363054,"Integrin adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins protects adhesion-dependent cells from suspension-induced apoptosis. Previous studies indicate that activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB was necessary for the integrin αvβ3 ligand osteopontin to protect endothelial cells from apoptosis caused by serum withdrawal. In this study, β3 integrins were overexpressed in smooth muscle cells. When plated on osteopontin, cells overexpressing wild-type β3 had enhanced cell adhesion, cell spreading, and nuclear factor-κB activation compared with vector control. Removal of four amino acids (759X) from the C terminus of β3 eliminated the ability of the integrin to promote these processes. Single amino acid substitutions indicated that phosphorylation at tyrosine 759 was not required for activation of the transcription factor, however this residue appeared to play a structural role, because mutation to alanine significantly inhibited nuclear factor-κB activation. The Src family of tyrosine kinases represents important transducers during integrin signaling, and the C terminus of β3 has been implicated as the binding site for Src. Immunoprecipitations demonstrated that Src associated with wild-type β3 integrins, but Src and integrins lacking the C terminus (759X) did not form a complex. Pharmacological inhibition with the Src inhibitor PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) or overexpression of kinase-dead c-Src blocked nuclear factor-κB activation. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for Src failed to activate nuclear factor-κB when plated on osteopontin, in contrast to control fibroblasts. Together, these experiments indicate that the C terminus of β3 and Src activity are required for integrin αvβ3-mediated nuclear factorκB activation.

Together, these experiments indicate that the C terminus of β3 and Src activity are required for integrin αvβ3-mediated nuclear factorκB activation. Integrins are heterodimeric receptors composed of two type I transmembrane glycoproteins, α and β. Integrins typically contain a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular domain with no known enzymatic function. The integrin extracellular domain binds to extracellular matrix ligands or cell surface ligands, whereas the intracellular domain provides a link to adapter proteins and the cytoskeleton. Thus, integrins act as adhesion receptors, physically linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. Integrin ligation also promotes intracellular signal transduction through outside-in signaling. These signaling pathways promote complex biological functions, including cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and cell survival. For many cell types, integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix is required for not only cell growth but also for cell survival (1.Meredith Jr., J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Disruption of adhesion causes the cells to undergo apoptosis, a process termed anoikis. Integrin antagonists also induce apoptosis both in vitro (2.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and in vivo (3.Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that non-ligated integrins can actively promote cell death (4.Stupack D.G. Puente X.S. Boutsaboualoy S. Storgard C.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar).

The Src family consists of eight members but only c-Src, Yes, and Fyn are ubiquitously expressed. SFKs show redundancy, therefore, inhibition of multiple SFKs is often required to demonstrate phenotypes. Mice deficient in the three ubiquitous kinases: c-Src, Yes, and Fyn, display developmental defects leading to embryonic lethality (5.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Embryonic fibroblasts from mice lacking c-Src, Yes, and Fyn (SYF cells) have reduced protein phosphotyrosine levels following integrin ligation and reduced cell migration on fibronectin (5.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Although c-Src is only modestly activated following integrin stimulation, c-Src has been shown to directly phosphorylate many downstream proteins, including FAK, Cas, and paxillin. In fibroblasts, SFKs regulate integrin-mediated cell attachment and spreading in response to fibronectin but not collagen (6.Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is another important player in cell survival. NF-κB activation protects endothelial cells, hepatocytes, B cells, osteoclasts, melanoma, and smooth muscle from apoptosis (7.Kucharczak J. Simmons M.J. Fan Y. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8961-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family consists of homo- or heterodimeric subunits of Rel family members. In the cytoplasm, NF-κB binds to the inhibitory protein I-κB (IκB). Upon stimulation, IκB becomes phosphorylated, ubiquinated, and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and promote gene expression of pro-survival genes, including but not limited to the inhibitors of apoptosis, bcl-2 family proteins, and osteoprotegrin (8.Malyankar U.M.

We have previously shown that integrin αvβ3 ligation in rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) activates NF-κB, protecting the cells from apoptosis (2.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Blocking αvβ3 ligation or preventing NF-κB activation induces cell death. Thus, NF-κB is a downstream mediator of integrin αvβ3 in endothelial cell survival. In the present study we provide evidence that the integrin αvβ3/NF-κB pathway is found in multiple cell types, perform structure/function studies to establish the region of the integrin αvβ3 required for NF-κB activation, determine that SFKs bind to integrin β3 and the association requires the C terminus of the integrin, and identify that SFK kinase activity is required for integrin αvβ3-mediated NF-κB activation.

The PBMN-IRES-eGFP vector was also treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to prevent self-ligation.

K402R forward: 5′-CCGTGGCTGTGAGAATACTGAAAAACGAGGCC-3′; K402R reverse: 5′-GGCCTCGTTTTTCAGTATTCTCACAGCCACGG-3′. Cell Culture—RAECs were purchased from VEC Technologies Inc. and grown in MCDB 131 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Medial smooth muscle cells from Wistar Kyoto rat pups were isolated as previously described (15.Lemire J.M. Covin C.W. White S. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1068-1081PubMed Google Scholar) and grown in Waymouth's MB 752/a media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were passaged by immersing in 0.05% trypsin. Retroviral Infections—High titer amphotrophic retrovirus was prepared as previously described (16.Garton K.J. Ferri N. Raines E.W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (832, 834 passim): 830Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, Phoenix packaging cells were transiently transfected with the retroviral plasmids. Medium was removed 10 and 24 h post-transfection. At 24-h post-transfection the cells were moved to a 32 °C incubator and virus was collected between 24 and 48 h after transfection. The virus-containing media was passed through a 0.45-μm filter to remove cellular debris. Twenty-four hours prior to the infections, 105 Wistar Kyoto rat smooth muscle cells (WKY) or 2 × 105 RAECs were plated per well in 6-well tissue culture plates. Cells underwent three rounds of infection. For each infection, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of retroviral-containing medium supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and spun at 1100 × g and 32 °C for 1 h then returned to the 37 °C incubator. After 24 h, the old medium was removed. Following the third infection, enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive cells were detected by flow cytometry when applicable. For viruses encoding Src, cells were selected with 200 μg/ml Hygromycin D (Calbiochem). Flow Cytometry—For integrin expression profiling, 1 × 106 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) plus 0.02% sodium azide. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with either non-immune mouse-IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) or the mouse monoclonal antibody SZ.21, which recognizes human β3 but not rat β3 (17.Liaw L. Lindner V. Schwartz S.M. Chambers A.F. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cells were washed and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Cells were washed and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. Samples were analyzed using the BD FACScan flow cytometry system and analyzed by CellQuest (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Recombinant OPN—Generation of histidine-tagged full-length recombinant rat OPN has been previously described (18.Martin S.M. Ganapathy R. Kim T.K. Leach-Scampavia D. Giachelli C.M. Ratner B.D. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 2003; 67A: 334-343Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli were transformed with the pQE30 plasmid encoding recombinant rat OPN with six histidines attached to the N terminus. The bacteria were amplified, and protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Research Products International, Mt. Prospect, IL). The protein was collected using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and eluted using 0.2 m imidazole (Acros Organics). Protein concentration was determined using the MicroBCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Western blots and adhesion assays verified protein purity and functionality respectively. Adhesion Assays—Adhesion assays were performed as previously described (19.Liaw L. Skinner M.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 713-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, protein solutions were diluted in PBS and adsorbed to 96-well Maxisorb plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) at 4 °C overnight. Wells were rinsed with PBS, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by adding 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and washed twice with Waymouth's media without serum. Samples were plated with 60,000 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The plates were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were stained with 0.5% toluidine blue (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) in 4% paraformaldehyde and rinsed in water. The dye was solubilized using 1% SDS. Adhesion was quantified by absorbance at 630 nm. NF-κB Activation Assays—Recombinant histidine-tagged rat OPN or poly-d-lysine (PDL) (Sigma-Aldrich) was adsorbed to 12-well tissue culture plates by incubating at 4 °C overnight. The wells were blocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. RAECs or WKY cells expressing the NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter were trypsinized and washed in serum-free media. For inhibition studies, the cells were treated with the active pharmacological Src inhibitor PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, Calbiochem) or the inactive control PP3 (4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol-[3,4-d]pyrimidine, Calbiochem) and kept in suspension for 45 min. The cells were then plated on the OPN-coated surfaces and allowed to adhere for 5–7 h. Non-adherent cells were washed away and adherent cells were lysed with Reporter Lysis Buffer from Promega (Madison, WI). Protein recovery was monitored by microBCA assay (Pierce). Luciferase activity was detected using the Promega Luciferase Assay System, and activity was normalized to total protein recovered. Western Blots—Proteins were extracted from cell monolayers in Laemmli buffer containing protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After lysis and boiling, protein concentration was determined by MicroBCA assay. 30 μg of lysate was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Identical gels were stained with Pro-Blue staining solution (Owl Separation Systems, Portsmouth, NH) to verify uniform loading. Samples were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with the appropriate primary antibody, washed, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Bands were detected using the Western Lightning chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitations—WKY cells overexpressing c-Src and vector control or integrin β3 subunits, WT or 759X, were grown to confluence and lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm NaF and protease inhibitors. 800 μg of lysate was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-integrin β3 antibody or rabbit IgG control antibody and Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). The immunoprecipitates or total cell lysate were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated detection antibodies. Previous studies showed that integrin αvβ3 ligation activated the transcription factor NF-κB in RAECs, and inhibition of αvβ3 ligation or inhibition of NF-κB activation caused endothelial cell apoptosis (2.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated the mechanism of αvβ3-mediated NF-κB activation. To determine which integrin subunit was involved in activation of NF-κB, melanoma cells overexpressing αvβ3 or αIIbβ3 were plated on the αvβ3 ligand fibronectin or the αIIbβ3 ligand fibrinogen, respectively. Both cell types activated NF-κB based on gel shift assays (data not shown), suggesting that the β3 subunit was the mediator for integrin-mediated NF-κB activation. Smooth Muscle Cell Adhesion through the Integrin αvβ3-Activated NF-κB—Medial smooth muscle cells from Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were identified as an excellent cell model for structure/function studies of the integrin β3 subunit, based on their high surface expression of αv and low expression of β3 (data not shown). To test NF-κB activation, WKY cells were infected with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase retroviral construct. The cells were then plated on surfaces coated with the β3 ligand OPN or PDL, which interacts with cells through a non-integrin-mediated electrostatic interaction. Luciferase readings for cells treated on PDL correspond to basal levels of NF-κB activation. Cells plated on the OPN-coated surface had enhanced luciferase activity (1.9-fold) relative to the PDL control as seen in Fig. 1, indicating that NF-κB had been activated. Activation of NF-κB was mediated by the αvβ3 integrin, because a β3-neutralizing antibody reduced OPN-mediated luciferase activity by 78%, whereas an IgG control antibody was unable to significantly reduce luciferase activity. Collagen, a ligand for β1 integrins, failed to increase NF-κB activation above basal levels (data not shown), further indicating the specificity of this pathway. Therefore, cellular adhesion to OPN through the integrin αvβ3 promoted NF-κB activation in smooth muscle cells as well as endothelial cells. The C Terminus of the β3 Subunit Was Necessary for Integrin-mediated NF-κB Activation—Retroviral vectors containing human integrin β3 constructs, either wild-type or mutated, were created (Table I) and used to stably infect WKY cells. Cells were incubated with an anti-human β3 antibody to detect surface expression of the integrin. All β3 constructs were efficiently expressed, with at least 80% of cells positive for surface expression of β3. The level of surface expression was similar for each of the β3 constructs, as shown in Fig. 2. Due to difficulties acquiring antibodies that recognize rat integrins, β3 constructs were also expressed in human smooth muscle cells and surface expression of other integrins was detected by flow cytometry. Overexpression of β3 did not significantly affect αvβ5, αvβ6, or β1 integrin expression levels (data not shown). Assuming the same trend occurs in rat smooth muscle cells, then observed phenotypes in cells infected with the β3 constructs are due to overexpression of αvβ3 integrins and not changes in the expression profile of other integrins.Table ISequences used in this studyNameCytoplasmic sequenceWild-type β3KLLITIHDRK EFAKFEEERA RAKWDTANNP LYKEATSTFT NITYRGT761XKLLITIHDRK EFAKFEEERA RAKWDTANNP LYKEATSTFT NITYRY759FKLLITIHDRK EFAKFEEERA RAKWDTANNP LYKEATSTFT NITFRGTY759AKLLITIHDRK EFAKFEEERA RAKWDTANNP LYKEATSTFT NITARGT759XKLLITIHDRK EFAKFEEERA RAKWDTANNP LYKEATSTFT NIT Open table in a new tab To test functionality of the β3 constructs, smooth muscle cells were seeded onto OPN-coated surfaces and allowed to attach for 2 h. Unattached cells were washed away, and phase contrast microscopy images of attached cells were acquired. All cell types attached to the OPN-coated surface (Fig. 3A), but substantial differences in post-receptor occupancy interactions were observed between the cell types. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) β3 dramatically increased cell spreading compared with vector control. Truncation of four amino acids from the C terminus (759X) eliminated the ability of the integrin to promote cell spreading, whereas removal of two amino acids did not impair cell spreading (761X). Substitution of tyrosine 759 with phenylalanine (Y759F) did not reduce cell spreading, but mutation to alanine (Y759A) resulted in an intermediate level of cell spreading. To quantify these post-receptor occupancy differences, adhesion assays were performed. Compared with vector control, overexpression of WT β3 significantly enhanced cellular adhesion by 3-fold or greater at all OPN concentrations tested (Fig. 3B). 759X significantly reduced adhesion compared with WT β3 (p < 0.001), whereas 761X did not impair the ability of the integrin to promote adhesion to OPN. Substitution of tyrosine 759 with phenylalanine (Y759F) did not reduce cell adhesion, indicating that phosphorylation of this residue was not required. Alanine substitution at this residue (Y759A) allowed for adhesion, but it was impaired compared with WT β3 especially at the lowest OPN concentration tested. Thus the adhesion assay results agreed with the differences in cell spreading seen in Fig. 3A. To test the ability of the integrins to mediate NF-κB activation, smooth muscle cells expressing the NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter and the integrin β3 constructs were plated on surfaces coated with the β3 ligand OPN. After 7 h, adherent cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized to protein recovered. For ease of comparison, vector control samples were then normalized to a value of one. Compared with vector control cells, overexpression of full-length β3 or 761X significantly increased NF-κB activation (p < 0.01), whereas 759X was unable to increase NF-κB activation when plated on OPN (Fig. 3C). Integrins with the Y759F mutation retained the ability to activate NF-κB, but WKY cells overexpressing Y759A integrins have significantly reduced activation of NF-κB compared with WT β3 (p < 0.01). These results indicated that tyrosine 759 of integrin β3 had a critical structural role in OPN-mediated NF-κB activation, because truncation at position 759 or substitution to alanine significantly inhibited activation of the transcription factor, but tyrosine phosphorylation was not required, since the Y759F mutation retained the ability to signal. Pharmacological Inhibition of SFKs Reduced Integrin αvβ3-Mediated NF-κB Activation—Having identified that tyrosine 759 within the C terminus of β3 was required for NF-κB activation, we performed a preliminary experiment to identify proximal downstream mediators of NF-κB activation. The Src family of tyrosine kinases was recently reported to bind directly to β3 integrins through the C terminus, and its members are known proximal mediators of integrin signals (20.Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). To test the role of SFKs in integrin-mediated NF-κB activation, RAECs were pretreated with the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2, the inactive analog PP3, or vehicle control and plated on OPN. Treatment with 10 μm PP2 significantly inhibited integrin-mediated NF-κB activation (p < 0.01), whereas 10 μm PP3 or vehicle did not, as seen in Fig. 4. Similar results were seen when WKY smooth muscle cells were also treated with PP2 and PP3 (data not shown). Although PP2 inhibition is not complete at this dosage and higher doses of PP2 fail to yield further inhibition, 10 μm PP2 does lead to greater than 75% reduction in integrin-mediated activation of the transcription factor. These results indicate that NF-κB activation required SFK activity in this model. Overexpression of Kinase-dead c-Src Blocked Integrin αvβ3-Mediated NF-κB Activation—To further characterize the role of SFKs, RAECs cells were infected with retroviral vectors encoding WT chicken c-Src (WT), kinase-dead c-Src (K295R), activated c-Src (Y527F), or the double mutant (K295R/Y527F) (13.Cary L.A. Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2427-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5A, lane 5, Western blots of total cell lysates indicated that the RAECs expressed endogenous SFKs (the antibody was unable to distinguish Src family members). Cells infected with c-Src constructs have enhanced Src protein expression (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–4). RAECs expressing the c-Src constructs were plated on PDL- or OPN-coated surfaces. Expression of c-Src constructs did not affect cell adhesion to OPN (data not shown). RAECs infected with the control vector activated NF-κB when plated on OPN as expected (Fig. 5B). Compared with vector control, overexpression of activated c-Src (Y527F) enhanced NF-κB activation independent of substrate (p < 0.01), suggesting that c-Src was downstream of the integrin αvβ3. Overexpression of kinase-dead c-Src (K295R) acted as a dominant negative inhibitor, completely blocking OPN-mediated NF-κB activation and reducing luciferase activity to levels seen on PDL. Kinase-dead c-Src may function either by preventing c-Src from phosphorylating a downstream substrate or by preventing autophosphorylation leading to a conformational change required for recruitment of other signaling moieties necessary for NF-κB activation. The c-Src double mutant K295R/Y527F maintains an activated conformation allowing recruitment of these moieties but prevents c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of other substrates. Overexpression of the double mutant also completely eliminated NF-κB activation (Fig. 5B), thus activation of the enzyme was not able to overcome the loss of its k"

UCP 1 is known to transport protons and dissipates the proton electrochemical gradient (Δp) across the mitochondrial inner membrane. UCP 1 thus acts as a major regulator of metabolic flux in mitochondria and as a heat regulator in the whole animal (1Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol.

UCP 1 synthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and thermogenesis are controlled by sympathetic nerve activity and thyroid status. Isolated brown adipocytes from cold-acclimated animals have increased oxygen consumption compared with those from room temperature animals, and the mitochondria isolated from active BAT are uncoupled (1Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of the uncoupling phenomenon is still a matter of investigation (9Skulachev V.P.

The purine nucleotide-binding site on UCP 1 in mitochondria faces the cytosolic side of the inner membrane, and in the presence of saturating amounts of purine nucleotides in vitro, oxygen consumption rates due to UCP 1 activity are inhibited. Subsequent addition of nanomolar concentrations of long chain free fatty acids in vitro restores the activity of UCP 1-containing mitochondria, and oxygen consumption rate increases (1Nicholls D.G.

To date, UCP 1 protein has not been found in any tissue other than BAT, although it has been sought in liver, heart, epididymal white adipose tissue, parametrial white adipose tissue, and thigh muscle (4Ricquier D.

However, in this study, we have detected UCP 1 transcripts in whole thymus and thymocytes by using RT-PCR. We have detected UCP 1 protein by using immunoblotting in mitochondria isolated from whole thymus and thymocytes. We have purified and identified UCP 1 from thymus mitochondria by using mass spectrometry. We have also shown that mitochondria isolated from thymus bind GDP with kinetics consistent with the presence of UCP 1 and have a GDP-sensitive and fatty acid-dependent proton leak indicative of the presence of UCP 1. Tissue Sources and Isolation of Mitochondria—Wild-type C57BL/6J mice, female CD-1 mice (20–25 g), and female Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus; 180–200 g) were provided by the BioResources Unit, Trinity College Dublin.

Thymocytes were isolated from Wistar rats (180–200 g) essentially as described by Buttgereit et al. (20Buttgereit F. Grant A. Muller M. Brand M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 15: 513-519Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The thymus was removed from the rat, trimmed clean of connective tissue and brown fat (if present), and transferred into RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). A single cell suspension was prepared by passage through 70-μm nylon sieves (Falcon). The thymocyte suspension was washed extensively. The viability of cells was >99% by trypan dye exclusion. Cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-rat Thy-1 (CD90; MRC OX-7; Serotec) or a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse IgG1 isotype control (Pharmingen). Data were collected on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Cellquest software. Oxygen consumption rates by thymocytes isolated from rats were measured in the aforementioned medium using an Oxygraph Respirometer (Oroboros™, Innsbruck, Austria). Mitochondria isolated from whole mouse thymus, whole rat thymus, rat thymocytes, rat kidney, and rat and mouse liver were isolated by homogenization followed by differential centrifugation according to the procedure of Chappell and Hansford (21Chappell J.B. Hansford R.G. Birnie G.D. Subcellular Components: Preparation and Fractionation. Butterworth, London1972: 77-91Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from rat skeletal muscle by mincing the muscle and treating the tissue with nagarse (protease VII, Sigma). Mitochondria were separated from the homogenate by differential centrifugation according to the procedure of Bhattacharya et al. (22Bhattacharya S.K. Thakar J.H. Johnson P.L. Shanklin D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein concentrations were determined by the reduction of Folins-Ciocalteau phosphomolybdic-phosphotungstic reagent according to the method of Markwell et al.

PCR and Analysis of the Products—Total RNA was purified from rat BAT, whole rat thymus, rat Thy-1-positive thymocytes, and liver using Tri Reagent™ (Sigma) containing guanidine thiocyanate. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase and random primers (Promega, Southampton, UK). Primers used to amplify UCP 1 were as described by Carroll and Porter (24Carroll A.M. Porter R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1700: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Primers for application of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sequence were used as a housekeeping gene control. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GenBank™ accession number M32599) primers were designed according to Tokunga et al. (25Tokunga K. Nakamura Y. Sakata K. Fujimori K. Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5616-5619PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification conditions were as follows: initial denaturation of 5 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C with a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR mixtures were electrophoresed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel incorporating ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light. Polyacrylamide Gels and Immunoblot Analysis—One-dimensional SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions was used to examine UCP 1 purity after hydroxyapatite chromatography. Proteins were detected by staining gels with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (26Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1998; 9: 255-262Crossref Scopus (2349) Google Scholar). This stain is very sensitive (can detect 8–10 ng of protein in a single gel band or spot) and is compatible with the post-staining processing required for mass spectrometry (see below). SDS-PAGE (reducing conditions) was also used to separate proteins prior to immunoblot analysis. UCP 2 purified from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli and UCP 3 protein from yeast, as described by Cunningham et al. (27Cunningham O. McElligott A.M. Carroll A.M. Breen E. Reguenga C.

Commercial anti-UCP 1 (amino acids 145–159) and anti-UCP 2 (amino acids 144–157) rabbit antisera were purchased from Calbiochem. A goat antiserum to full-length rabbit UCP 1 protein was a gift from Dr. Daniel Ricquier, CNRS, Meudon, France. A rabbit antiserum specific for the β-subunit of F1-ATP synthase from Neurospora crassa was a gift from Dr. Matt Harmey, Department of Botany, University College Dublin, Ireland. The antisera were all used at 1:1000 dilution. Following blocking and a 1-h primary antibody incubation, the blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, 5% (w/v) milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoreactions were visualized by exposure to Kodak X-Omat LS film. GDP Binding Assay—Endogenous residual bound nucleotides were removed from isolated mitochondria using an anion exchanger (Dowex 21K) by the procedure described by Huang and Klingenberg (15Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, were shaken with Dowex (120 mg/mg protein) at room temperature for 1 h. Measurement of binding of tritiated GDP was performed by a modification of the procedure described by Scarpace et al. (28Scarpace P.J. Bender B.S. Borst S.E. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1991; 69: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (50 μg) were incubated with [3H]GDP (0.1–6.0 μm, 11.0 Ci/mmol) and [14C]sucrose (250 μCi/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C in the absence (total binding) and presence (nonspecific binding) of unlabeled GDP (1.5 mm). Specific binding was calculated from the difference between total and nonspecific binding. The Michaelis dissociation constant (KD) and the maximal binding capacity (Bmax), describing the saturable binding of [3H]GDP, were obtained by fitting mean values for specific binding sites on the y axis and free radioligand concentrations used on the x axis by using the program “Sigma Plot,” version 5 (SPSS Inc. Chicago). The data were fitted to a rectangular hyperbola by nonweighted, nonlinear least squares regression. Oxygen Consumption by Nonphosphorylating Mitochondria—Oxygen consumption rates were measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode as described by González-Barroso et al. (29González-Barroso M. Fleury C. Bouillaud F. Nicholls D.G. Rial E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15528-15532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in medium containing 120 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 16 μm fatty-acid free BSA, 5 μm atractyloside, 5 μm rotenone, and 1 μg/ml oligomycin. Nonphosphorylating (state 4) oxygen consumption rates were measured as the steady-state rates achieved on addition of 7.5 mm succinate (succinate-KOH, pH 7.4). The sensitivity of this state 4 oxygen consumption rate to GDP (1 mm) was then determined. The sensitivity of the resulting oxygen consumption rate to palmitate (in ethanol) (64 μm) (∼40 nm free) was then determined. Finally, the mitochondrial uncoupler cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (40 nm FCCP) was added to the chamber to determine the maximum oxygen consumption rate attainable due to uncoupling. The Clark-type oxygen electrode was calibrated according to the procedure of Reynafarje et al. (30Reynafarje B. Costa L.E. Lehninger A.L. Anal.

Purification of UCP 1 from Rat Thymus Mitochondria—Purification of UCP 1 was performed using a hydroxyapatite (HTP) column chromatography procedure as described by Lin and Klingenberg (31Lin C.S. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1980; 113: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Intact thymus mitochondria (8–10 mg) suspended in STE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Trizma (Tris base), 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) were centrifuged at 22,600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellet was solubilized in 13% (v/v) octylpentaoctylethylene (octyl-POE) ether in STE (total volume ∼500 μl) and incubated on ice for 10 min prior to loading the solubilized mitochondrial proteins onto an HTP column. The column was prepared by soaking 0.34 g of HTP in 10 ml of STE buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, for 6 h prior to pouring it into a 1-ml column (Bio-Rad) (diameter 1 cm, length 6 cm). The soaking solution was removed from the column by centrifugation at 800 × g for 2 min at room temperature immediately prior to loading of the mitochondrial proteins. The HTP column, containing the solubilized mitochondrial proteins, was incubated at room temperature for 10 min (to denature the adenine nucleotide carrier) followed by 25 min of incubation at 4 °C. The column was then centrifuged at 800 × g for 2 min to remove the HTP eluate (UCP 1-enriched fraction), leaving behind the unwanted bound proteins. The protein concentration of the HTP eluate was determined (23Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5307) Google Scholar), and the octyl-POE detergent was removed using a Bio-Bead (Bio-Rad) column. The Bio-Bead column was prepared by placing 2 ml of Bio-Beads (suspended in distilled/deionized H2O) into a 2-ml syringe barrel and allowing them to settle. The H2O was removed from the Bio-Beads by centrifugation at 800 × g for 2 min. The Bio-Beads were equilibrated in ∼2 ml of STE buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min prior to use and were further centrifuged at 800 × g for 2 min to remove excess STE buffer. The HTP eluate was loaded onto the Bio-Beads with gentle mixing and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with periodic slight agitation using a vortex-type mixer. The Bio-Bead column was centrifuged at 800 × g for 2 min, and the protein eluate was collected. The protein concentration of this elute was determined, and ∼5–10 μg of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 staining. Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry—A 30–33-kDa colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250-stained protein band was excised from a one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 6A) and was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube (previously autoclaved and rinsed with 50% high pressure liquid chromatography grade methanol to remove any contaminants) containing 100 μl of 20% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The excised band was de-stained for 2 days in several washes of 50% (v/v) methanol, 5% (v/v) acetic acid, dehydrated with acetonitrile, reduced for 30 min with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 56 °C, and alkylated for 30 min with 100 mm iodoacetamide at 45 °C as described previously (32Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 147-165Google Scholar). The carboxyamidomethylated protein band was digested overnight at 37 °C with 40 μl of 20 ng/μl sequencing grade, modified porcine trypsin according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega, Madison, WI). Peptides were extracted from the gel by using a series of elutions with 10% (v/v) formic acid. The resulting eluate pool was reduced to a final volume of 20 μl in a SpeedVac Concentrator (Savant, Hicksville, NY) and processed for mass spectrometry. Peptide Mass Mapping—Peptide mass mapping was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. A 5-μl amount of the trypsin-digested sample was desalted and concentrated using a micro ZipTip μ-C18 (C18 resin; P10, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The peptide mixture was eluted from the ZipTip with 1 μl of the MALDI-TOF matrix, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, Sigma), and spotted onto a Voyager stainless steel MALDI plate (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). An Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) running in delayed extraction and reflectron mode was used to acquire MALDI-TOF data. Selected peptide masses were submitted to four on-line search algorithms that use peptide masses to identify proteins from primary sequence data bases as follows: MS-Fit (Protein Prospector software package; San Francisco, CA, prospector.ucsf.edu/), Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK, www.matrixscience.com/), ProFound (Prowl, Rockefeller University, prowl.rockefeller.edu), and PeptideSearch (EMBL Bioanalytical Research Group, Heidelberg, Germany, www.mann.embl-heidelberg.de/GroupPages/PageLink/peptidesearch/Services/PeptideSearch/FR_PeptideSearchFormG4.html). Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry—The remaining peptide digest was analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The peptide samples were first desalted and concentrated on a PepMap C18 precolumn and then separated on a PepMap C18 column (LC Packings-Dionex, The Netherlands) followed by tandem mass spectrometry using a PE Sciex QStar Pulsar i Quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The independent data acquisition parameters were as follows: after a 1-s survey scan from 400 to 1500 m/z, peaks with signal intensity over 10 counts with charge state +2 to +4 were selected for MS/MS fragmentation followed by a 2-s MS/MS from 65 to 1800 m/z for the four most intense ions in the survey scan. Once an ion was selected for MS/MS fragmentation, it was put on an exclude list for 180 s to prevent that ion from being gated again. A 4-atomic mass unit peak window was used to avoid gating of masses from the same isotopic cluster during the survey scan. Keratin and porcine trypsin peak masses were put on an exclude list to prevent these ions from being selected for MS/MS analysis. Independent acquisition data were submitted to ProID (proprietary Applied Biosystems software) for bioinformatics analysis of public protein data base (NCBInr) and subsequent protein identification. By using RT-PCR, UCP 1 transcripts were detected in rat thymus and BAT (Fig. 1, lane 4 in each case). As shown previously (24Carroll A.M. Porter R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1700: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), rat liver was negative for UCP 1 transcripts. The specificity of our primers for detection of transcripts encoding uncoupling proteins 1–3 in rat brown adipose tissue, known to express all of these transcripts, has been demonstrated previously (24Carroll A.M. Porter R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1700: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although it was clear that transcripts for UCP 1 were present in rat thymus, it was important to know whether UCP 1 protein was expressed. To that end we used an anti-UCP 1 polyclonal antibody (from Calbiochem). The specificity of the antibody (Calbiochem) is demonstrated in the supplemental figure. We showed that UCP 1 protein was present in mitochondria isolated from rat brown adipose tissue (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and mitochondria isolated from whole rat thymus of fed (lane 2) and fasted (lane 3) animals (and in thymocytes from fed and fasted rats; results not shown). UCP 1 was clearly expressed at higher levels in mitochondria from brown adipose tissue (Fig. 2A, lane 1). As expected, no UCP 1 protein was detected in equivalent amounts of mitochondria isolated from rat liver (Fig. 2A, lane 4). As a control for assessing protein loading, an antibody to the F1 β-subunit of ATP synthase was used in immunoblots on the same mitochondrial preparations (Fig. 2B). Collation of data for three separate preparations and experiments demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in expression of the UCP 1 protein in mitochondria isolated from rat thymus when compared with the fed and fasted states (Fig. 2C; or rat thymocytes; results not shown). These results were confirmed using other anti-UCP 1 antibodies, namely a UCP 1-specific anti-peptide antibody characterized by Cunningham et al. (27Cunningham O. McElligott A.M. Carroll A.M. Breen E. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E.M. Azevedo J.E. Porter R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and also an antibody to the full-length UCP 1 (results not shown). The anti-UCP 1 peptide antibody also detected UCP 1 in mitochondria isolated from the thymus of wild-type mice (Fig. 3, lane 6) but not in mitochondria from thymus of UCP 1 knock-out mice (Fig. 3, lane 5). The immunoblot also shows detection of UCP 1 in mitochondria isolated from BAT of wild-type mice (Fig. 3, lane 8) but not in mitochondria from BAT of UCP 1 knock-out mice (lane 7) as expected. No protein was detected using this antibody in mitochondria isolated from liver (Fig. 3, lane 2) or kidney (lane 4) of wild-type mice or liver (lane 1) or kidney (lane 3) of UCP 1 knock-out mice. BAT can be present in the vicinity of the thymus. Therefore, a reasonable concern is that the detection of UCP 1 in mitochondria isolated from whole thymus could be due to BAT contamination of the thymus preparation. As BAT is visibly distinguishable from the translucent white thymus when present, it is easily removed (results not shown). However, to formally ensure there was no BAT contamination of the thymus, a single cell suspension of thymocytes was prepared from thymus from rats or mice. By using flow cytometry, it was confirmed that >99% of cells in the resulting thymocyte suspension from rats, and also mice, were positive for the thymocyte-specific marker, Thy-1 (Fig. 4A; data not shown). Consistent with the data from whole thymus (Figs. 1 and 3), both UCP-1 transcripts and UCP 1 protein were detected in this thymocyte preparation (Fig. 4, B and C). UCP 1 is known to contain a purine nucleotide-binding site that is accessible from the cytoplasmic side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Thus, in the presence of atractyloside/carboxyatractyloside (which inhibits function and prevents purine nucleotide binding to the adenine nucleotide carrier), purine nucleotide binding to brown adipose tissue mitochondria can be used as a measure of UCP 1 abundance. However, experience from working with brown adipose tissue mitochondria taken from animals held at r"

In the present study, we found that the myelin basic protein gene is one of the genes that is regulated by Nkx2.2. Expression of Nkx2.2 represses the expression of myelin basic protein in oligodendrocyte progenitors. Two regulatory elements in the myelin basic protein promoter were identified and found to interact with Nkx2.2 in vitro. Despite their sequence divergence, both sites were involved in the Nkx2.2-mediated repression of the myelin basic protein promoter. Binding of Nkx2.2 also blocked and disrupted the binding of the transcriptional activator Purα to the myelin basic protein promoter. Additionally Nkx2.2 recruited a histone deacetylase 1-mSin3A complex to the myelin basic protein promoter. We also found that the transcription factor Sp1 was able to compete off the binding of Nkx2.2 to its consensus binding site in vitro and reversed the repressive effect of Nkx2.2 in vivo. Our data revealed a novel role for Nkx2.2 in preventing the precocious expression of myelin basic protein in immature oligodendrocytes.

Our data revealed a novel role for Nkx2.2 in preventing the precocious expression of myelin basic protein in immature oligodendrocytes. Based on this study and our previous reports, a model for myelin basic protein gene control is proposed. Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-producing cells in the central nervous system. Differentiation of the progenitor cells into mature myelinating cells involves the activation of a genetic program that leads to expression of a set of genes encoding proteins important for the elaboration of the myelin membrane. The expression of these genes is at least partially regulated by transcription factor activity. These regulators of transcription include activators, repressors, and their cofactors. Transcriptional regulation may also involve chromatin modifications. One of the genes that is activated during differentiation of oligodendrocytes is the gene encoding myelin basic protein (MBP). 1The abbreviations used are: MBP, myelin basic protein; HDAC, histone deacetylase; DM, differentiation medium; Luc, luciferase; TSA, trichostatin A; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PLP, proteolipid protein. This gene is exclusively expressed in mature oligodendrocytes, and its expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. It provides an ideal model to investigate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation during cellular differentiation. Myelination begins in the mouse at ∼9 days after birth, peaks at about postnatal day 17, and declines to a steady state by 2 months of age. MBP is encoded by a single gene in the mouse and human. The sequence of the MBP promoter from mouse, rat, and human has been determined, and it is highly conserved, especially in the core promoter region (1Wei Q. Miskimins W.K. Miskimins R. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 313: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In mouse brain, MBP mRNA is detected in oligodendrocytes at the end of the first postnatal week, peaks at 18 days, and remains at low levels in the adult (2Sorg B.A. Smith M.M. Campagnoni A.T. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus expression of MBP is temporally regulated and is tightly correlated with myelination in the developing central nervous system. Previous work from our laboratory and the laboratories of others has shown that several different transcription factors are involved in activation of MBP expression in differentiating oligodendrocytes. Among these is the Sp1 family of transcription factors. Sp1 plays an essential role in the regulation of MBP expression through binding to the GC-rich region of the MBP promoter (3Tamura T. Miura M. Ikenaka K. Mikoshiba K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11441-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4Tretiakova A. Steplewski A. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell.

Through interaction with Sox10, Sp1 activates and contributes to the tissue-specific expression of MBP in the central nervous system (6Wei Q. Miskimins W.K. Miskimins R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other transcription factors also found to play a role in the regulation of MBP expression include nuclear factor κB (7Huang C.J.

Nkx2.2, a member of the homeodomain transcription factor gene family, has been shown to be involved in oligodendrocyte specification (12Briscoe J. Sussel L. Serup P. Hartigan-O'Connor D. Jessell T.M. Rubenstein J.L. Ericson J. Nature. 1999; 398: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 13Kitamura K. Miura H. Yanazawa M. Miyashita T. Kato K. Mech.

Development. 2001; 128: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the target genes of Nkx2.2 are still unclear. In the present study, we found that expression of Nkx2.2 repressed the expression of MBP in CG4 cells. Repression of MBP expression by Nkx2.2 involved disruption of the binding of a transcriptional activator and recruitment of the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)-mSin3A corepressor complex to the MBP promoter. We also showed that Sp1 was able to compete off the binding of Nkx2.2 to the MBP promoter in vitro and reverse the effect of Nkx2.2 on the MBP promoter in vivo. These results suggested that Nkx2.2 plays a role in the regulation of MBP expression and that coordination of various transcription factors including Nkx2.2 and Sp1 defines the temporal and specific expression of MBP in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Cell Culture—CG4 cells were cultured and induced to differentiate as reported previously (5Wei Q. Miskimins W.K. Miskimins R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4035-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were plated in dishes coated with poly-l-ornithine and cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. Cells were maintained in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 30 nm sodium selenite, 50 ng/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml transferrin, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor, 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C. Fresh platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor were added to the cultures every other day. To induce differentiation, cells were switched to differentiation medium (DM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 30 nm sodium selenite, 5 μg/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml transferrin, 10 nm biotin, 10 nm hydrocortisone, 30 nm 3,3′,5′-triiodo-l-thyronine, 20 nm progesterone, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Plasmids—The MBP-luciferase (MBP-Luc) constructs -1323 MBPLuc and -105 MBPLuc were made as described previously (1Wei Q. Miskimins W.K. Miskimins R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic Nkx2.2 expression plasmid (pBAT12.shNkx2.2) was a gift from Dr. M. S. German (University of California, San Francisco) and is described in Watada et al. (16Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Leung J. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34224-34230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A second Nkx2.2 expression plasmid (pLNCX2.Nkx2.2) was provided by Dr. M. Qiu (University of Louisville) and is described in Qi et al. (14Qi Y. Cai J. Wu Y. Wu R. Lee J. Fu H. Rao M. Sussel L. Rubenstein J. Qiu M. Development. 2001; 128: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Nkx2.2 coding region was amplified from pBAT-Nkx2.2 by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pRSET-A to generate the prokaryotic Nkx2.2 expression plasmid (pRSET-Nkx2.2) encoding an N-terminal His6-tagged Nkx2.2 fusion protein. The eukaryotic Purα expression plasmid (pCI-purα) and prokaryotic expression plasmid (pQE30-Purα) encoding His-Purα were kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Kelm (University of Vermont) and are described in Carlini et al. (17Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol.

Lassar (Harvard University) and is described in Kim et al. (19Kim D.W. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8704-8717Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). DNA Transfection and Luciferase Assays—CG4 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and cultured as described above. Transfections were done in growth medium using GenePorter (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A combination of 1.0 μg of MBPLuc construct and 2.0 μg of expression plasmid or control vector (unless otherwise specified) was transfected into each dish of cells. Four hours after transfection, the medium was changed to DM. For treatment with trichostatin A (TSA) (Calbiochem), the medium was changed to DM containing TSA or Me2SO. After 48 h, the cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured in a Packard TopCount luminometer. The samples were also assayed for protein content using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent and for luciferase activity using Steady-Glo luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to the protein concentration. Site-specific Mutagenesis—The eukaryotic expression plasmid pBAT-NkxNQ was made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. pBAT-NkxNQ encodes a mutant form of Nkx2.2 containing a single amino acid mutation (Asn to Gln) in the homeodomain. The prokaryotic expression plasmid pQE30-NkxNQ was made using the same strategy. Reporter gene constructs containing a mutated 5′-flanking region of the MBP gene in which the Nkx2.2 binding sites were altered were also made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. All constructs were subjected to sequencing to confirm the mutations. Protein Purification—Plasmids encoding His-Nkx2.2, His-NkxNQ, or His-Purα were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21. For protein preparation, 500 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with a 25-ml overnight culture and incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 3–5 h until the A595 reached 0.6. Recombinant protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The culture was further incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was completely resuspended in 10 ml of IMAC-5 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were lysed by sequential addition of lysozyme to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) and then incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional stirring. Lysates were then subjected to pulse sonication on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. His-Bind resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) equilibrated with IMAC-5 was charged with 5 mg/ml NiCl2. The column was then equilibrated with 10 volumes of IMAC-5 following which the cell lysates were loaded. The His-tagged protein was eluted with a step gradient of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 5, 20, 50, 100, and 200 mm imidazole. Fractions were collected and analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel that was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Fractions containing the target protein were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C overnight. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Protein samples were stored at -70 °C. DNase I Footprinting—-1323 MBPLuc plasmid was digested with StuI and HindIII to generate the MBP promoter fragment containing sequences from -265 to +30. The fragment was purified and labeled with [α-32P]dATP by end-filling using Klenow fragment. The probe (20,000 cpm) was incubated with ∼0.5 μg of purified Nkx2.2 in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a total volume of 25 μl and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. MgCl2 (10 mm) and CaCl2 (5 mm) were added, and the reaction was incubated for 1 min at room temperature. DNase I was then added to the reaction at a final concentration of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 μg/ml. A control tube without DNase I was also treated similarly. After further incubation for 1 min at room temperature the reaction was stopped by adding 75 μl of stop solution (20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 0.2 m NaCl, 125 μg/ml yeast tRNA) and extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, and the nucleic acids were precipitated with 2.5 volumes of chilled ethanol. The precipitated nucleic acids were dissolved in 10 μl of formamide dye, mixed by vigorous shaking, and boiled for 5 min. A Maxam-Gilbert G reaction was also performed using the labeled MBP promoter fragment according to standard procedures (20Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed.2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Samples were run on a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and visualized by autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed and end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentis, Hanover, MD). The Sp1 protein used in these experiments was purified from HeLa cells (Promega). Approximately 0.5–5 ng (10,000–20,000 cpm) of labeled probe was incubated for 30 min on ice with ∼0.5 μg of recombinant protein (unless otherwise specified) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2 μg poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 40 μl. When included as competitors, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added in excess to the reaction together with the labeled probe. Complexes were resolved on 3.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA (0.022 m Tris, 0.022 m boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA). Gels were dried, and complexes were detected by phosphorimaging on an Amersham Biosciences Typhoon. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Western blotting was done as described previously (5Wei Q. Miskimins W.K. Miskimins R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4035-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies and dilutions used were goat anti-Nkx2.2 (sc-15015, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1: 2000), rabbit anti-p27 (sc-527, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:2500), rabbit anti-Sp1 (sc-59, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:250), rabbit anti-Sox10 (Abcam; 1:2000), mouse anti-MBP (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA; 1:2000), rabbit anti-2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphohydrolase (Chemicon International; 1:2000), mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma; 1:10,000), rabbit anti-histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000), mouse anti-FLAG (Stratagene; 1: 1000), mouse anti-HDAC1 (sc-8410, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000), and rabbit anti-mSin3A (sc-994, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1: 1000). The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were mouse anti-FLAG and goat anti-Nkx2.2. Mouse anti-FLAG-conjugated protein G beads (Sigma) were also used for immunoprecipitation. The control antibodies for nonspecific binding were mouse anti-p27 (sc-1641, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat anti-Sox10 (sc-17343, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation, cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected with plasmids encoding Nkx2.2 and HDAC1. Two days after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and were collected by scraping. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a short sonication, cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined as described above. About 1 mg of total lysate protein was used for each immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were precleared by incubation for 2 h with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-conjugated (or protein G-conjugated) agarose beads at 4 °C. After removal of the beads, 4 μg of antibody was added to each reaction, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-conjugated (or protein G-conjugated) agarose beads (30 μl of a 50% slurry) were added to the reaction, and incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed four times with lysis buffer. SDS sample buffer was added to each sample followed by heating for 5 min. The samples were then loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by Western blotting. Nkx2.2 Is Down-regulated as CG4 Cells Are Induced to Terminally Differentiate—CG4 cells are derived from primary cultures of rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells (21Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). They proliferate in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. Upon withdrawal of growth factors, these cells are capable of differentiating into mature oligodendrocytes. After being transplanted into the central nervous system, they function as oligodendrocytes in vivo to myelinate axons (22Espinosa de los Monteros A. Zhao P. Huang C. Pan T. Chang R. Nazarian R. Espejo D. de Vellis J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 872-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nkx2.2 is expressed in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and is important for oligodendrocyte specification in the developing spinal cord. We therefore first investigated the expression of Nkx2.2 in CG4 cells by Western blotting. Nkx2.2 was expressed at elevated levels in proliferating cells and was down-regulated when these cells undergo terminal differentiation (Fig. 1). After 3 days of culture in differentiation medium, Nkx2.2 was not detectable, whereas the expression of MBP was significantly elevated (Fig. 1). Thus the level of Nkx2.2 expression was inversely correlated with the levels of differentiation markers such as 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphohydrolase and MBP. This expression pattern is similar to those reported in primary oligodendrocytes in vivo (23Watanabe M. Hadzic T. Nishiyama A. Glia. 2004; 46: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The levels of the transcription factors Sp1 and Sox10 also increase in differentiating CG4 cells and primary oligodendrocytes (5Wei Q. Miskimins W.K. Miskimins R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4035-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Wei Q. Miskimins W.K. Miskimins R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These data suggested that CG4 cells represent an accurate model in which to study Nkx2.2 expression and function during differentiation. Nkx2.2 Inhibits MBP Promoter Activity—To explore the function of Nkx2.2 in the regulation of MBP expression, reporter gene constructs containing either 1323 or 105 bp of the MBP promoter upstream of the luciferase gene were made (Fig. 2A). CG4 cells were cotransfected with each of the MBP-luciferase constructs and either a control plasmid or a plasmid encoding Nkx2.2. After transfection the cells were switched to differentiation medium for 2 days before harvesting for luciferase assays. The results of these transfection experiments are shown in Fig. 2B. Compared with control, expression of Nkx2.2 caused a dramatic decrease of luciferase activity driven by either the -1323 or -105 MBP promoter (Fig. 2B). Transfection experiments using a different expression vector encoding Nkx2.2 gave rise to the same results (data not shown). Similar repression effects were also obtained by co-transfection of reporter gene constructs and Nkx2.2 plasmids into CG4 cells under growing conditions (data not shown). Therefore, it appeared that expression of Nkx2.2 strongly repressed MBP promoter activity in both proliferating and differentiating cells. These data also suggested that the -105 MBP promoter contains regulatory elements that respond to the expression of Nkx2.2. Nkx2.2 Binds to the MBP Promoter through Two Distinct Binding Sites—The Nkx family of proteins has been shown to modulate gene expression through interacting with multiple cis-elements within various target genes. It is likely that the repression of the MBP promoter by Nkx2.2 also shares a similar mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we first did DNase I footprinting to identify the cis-elements involved in the binding of Nkx2.2 to the MBP promoter. His-tagged Nkx2.2 was expressed in E. coli, and recombinant protein was purified. Purified protein was incubated with a 32P-labeled fragment of the MBP promoter containing sequences between -300 and +30 and subjected to increasing amounts of DNase I digestion. In this region of the MBP promoter, two sites were found to be protected from DNase I digestion by Nkx2.2. These are shown in Fig. 3A in the boxes. Interestingly both binding regions are located downstream of -105 in the MBP promoter, which is consistent with luciferase data showing that this length of promoter could still be repressed by Nkx2.2. Inspection of the sequences protected by Nkx2.2 revealed a conserved Nkx2.2 binding site, ACTTGA (-83 to -78), within site A (Fig. 3B, underlined), while the second site showed no sequence homology to the consensus binding site (Fig. 3B, site B). Binding of Nkx2.2 to site A in the MBP promoter was also confirmed by EMSAs using recombinant Nkx2.2. Two probes were used in these experiments. One was an MBP promoter fragment spanning -95 to -76 containing the consensus Nkx2.2 binding site. The other was a probe with mutations in the consensus binding site (Fig. 4A). Nkx2.2 was capable of binding to the probe containing the consensus Nkx2.2 site in the wild type MBP promoter context (Fig. 4B, lane 2). This binding was specific since it could be competed by unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the consensus sequence but not by oligonucleotides containing nonspecific sequences (data not shown). However, there was no complex formed when the probe containing a mutation in the consensus sequence was used as a probe (Fig. 4B, lane 4). This indicated that the mutation in the consensus binding site completely disrupted the binding of Nkx2.2 to this region of the MBP promoter. To pinpoint the Nkx2.2 binding sequences in site B of the MBP promoter, we made a series of probes corresponding to the sequences between -27 and -10 of the MBP promoter. Each oligonucleotide contained a different mutation in site B (Fig. 5A). EMSAs were performed using these probes and recombinant Nkx2.2. The results are shown in Fig. 5B. Nkx2.2 did bind to this region of the MBP promoter as shown in lane 1, which is consistent with our DNase I footprinting assay. The binding was also specific as it could be competed by unlabeled specific competitor oligonucleotides but not by other nonspecific competitors (data not shown). Mutation of the sequence GGCCCTC led to partial or complete loss of Nkx2.2 binding (Fig. 5B, lanes 2–4), while mutation of bases other than this sequence had no significant effect on binding (Fig. 5B, lane 5). These data indicated that Nkx2.2 bound to site B through the GGCCCTC sequence. Nkx2.2 Has a Higher Binding Affinity for Site A than Site B, but Both Sites Are Involved in Nkx2.2-mediated Repression of the MBP Promoter—To assess the relative binding affinity of Nkx2.2 for sites A and B, we did a competitive binding assay using either unlabeled site A-containing oligonucleotides or unlabeled site B-containing oligonucleotides to compete the binding of Nkx2.2 to a labeled probe containing site B. Both competitors were capable of effectively competing with the probe for Nkx2.2 binding (Fig. 6). However, the cold competitor containing site A was a better competitor of the binding of Nkx2.2 to the probe than the site B-containing competitor (Fig. 6B). Similar experiments were also performed using unlabeled competitors to compete the binding of Nkx2.2 to site A-containing probes with similar results (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that Nkx2.2 bound with a higher affinity to site A-containing sequences than to site B-containing sequences. To test whether either one or both sites are involved in the Nkx2.2-mediated repression of the MBP promoter, transient transfection experiments were performed. Reporter gene constructs driven by either the wild type MBP promoter or the MBP promoter containing mutations in one or the other Nkx2.2 binding sites were used. The mutations in site A (CTT mutated to ACA) or site B (CCC mutated to AAA) were those shown to completely disrupt the binding of Nkx2.2 to the MBP promoter (Figs. 4 and 5). Expression of Nkx2.2 was still able to repress promoter activity when either site A or site B was mutated in the MBP promoter. However, the amount of repression was not as great as with the wild type promoter (Fig. 7). However, when both binding sites were mutated Nkx2.2 was no longer able to repress MBP promoter activity. Instead there was a slight increase in luciferase activity, which may result from the titration of corepressors away from the promoter by Nkx2.2. These data indicated that both sites A and B were involved in Nkx2.2-mediated repression of the MBP promoter. The Homeodomain of Nkx2.2 Is Required for Binding and Repression of the MBP Promoter—The Nkx2 family of transcription factors contains three highly conserved regions including the homeodomain, the tin domain, or the N-terminal decapeptide and the Nkx2-specific domain (24Hartigan D.J.

Accordingly, COL10A1 mutations disrupt growth plate function and cause Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD). SMCD mutations are almost exclusively located in the NC1 domain, which is crucial for both trimer formation and extracellular assembly. Several mutations are expected to reduce the level of functional collagen X due to NC1 domain misfolding or exclusion from stable trimer formation. However, other mutations may be tolerated within the structure of the assembled NC1 trimer, allowing mutant chains to exert a dominant-negative impact within the extracellular matrix. To address this, we engineered SMCD mutations that are predicted either to prohibit subunit folding and assembly (NC1del10 and Y598D, respectively) or to allow trimerization (N617K and G618V) and transfected these constructs into 293-EBNA and SaOS-2 cells. Although expected to form stable trimers, G618V and N617K chains (like Y598D and NC1del10 chains) were secreted very poorly compared with wild-type collagen X. Interestingly, all mutations resulted in formation of an unusual SDS-stable dimer, which dissociated upon reduction. As the NC1 domain sulfhydryl group is not solvent-exposed in the correctly folded NC1 monomer, disulfide bond formation would result only from a dramatic conformational change. In cells expressing mutant collagen X, we detected significantly increased amounts of the spliced form of X-box DNA-binding protein mRNA and up-regulation of BiP, two key markers for the unfolded protein response. Our data provide the first clear evidence for misfolding of SMCD collagen X mutants, and we propose that solvent exposure of the NC1 thiol may trigger the recognition and degradation of mutant collagen X chains.

Collagen X is a major constituent of the pericellular matrix of hypertrophic chondrocytes within the cartilage growth plate (1Chan D. Jacenko O. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the expression of collagen X during endochondral ossification is intimately linked to the onset of cartilage calcification and extracellular matrix remodeling (2Schmid T.M. Popp R.G. Linsenmayer T.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The absence of a functional collagen X network in mice is associated with displacement of proteoglycans, altered mineral deposition, compression of the growth plate, and hematopoietic changes (3Gress C.J.

Based on these studies, it has been proposed that collagen X interactions within the cartilage extracellular matrix establish the correct microenvironment for matrix mineralization and subsequent bone development.The human α1(X) collagen chain has a short collagenous domain flanked at the C and N termini by globular NC1 and NC2 domains. The NC1 domain plays a critical role in intracellular trimer formation (6Zhang Y. Chen Q. J. Biol.

Cheah K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7992-7997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), SMCD mutations are located in the NC1 domain (1Chan D. Jacenko O.

Mutat. 2004; 23: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Despite a lack of phenotypic variation in affected patients, the SMCD mutations identified to date range from amino acid substitutions to nonsense mutations and deletions resulting in premature termination codons. Analysis of the effect of SMCD mutations in vitro and in vivo has generated several alternative hypotheses for the underlying disease mechanism. In the case of nonsense mutations, analysis of cartilage from two SMCD patients with collagen X premature termination codons (W611X and Y632X) demonstrated complete nonsense-mediated decay of mutant mRNA (16Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bateman J.F. Freddi S. Nattrass G. Savarirayan R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although cartilage has not been available from other patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations, recent studies using transfection of engineered mouse gene constructs into chondrocytes have shown that premature termination codon mutations throughout the gene region coding for the NC1 domain result in nonsense-mediated decay. 2J. F. Bateman, S. Freddi, S. Golub, and K. M. Bell, unpublished data. 2J. F. Bateman, S. Freddi, S. Golub, and K. M. Bell, unpublished data. However, premature terminations close to the normal stop codon (such as NC1del10) may escape degradation at the mRNA level and produce NC1 domains with short C-terminal truncations. These data strongly suggest that mRNA surveillance and degradation of transcripts with premature termination codons by nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in haploinsufficiency, are the most common disease mechanism in SMCD patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations.Investigation of the effect of missense mutations on collagen X structure and function has relied on analysis of collagen X assembly and secretion in vitro. Both haploinsufficiency due to compromised collagen X assembly and dominant effects on collagen X function (either at the level of trimer formation or within the extracellular matrix) have been proposed as underlying disease mechanisms. Indeed, several SMCD missense mutants co-assemble with wild-type α1(X) collagen chains in vitro (18McLaughlin S.H. Conn S.N. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7570-7575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Chan D. Freddi S. Weng Y.M. Bateman J.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3632-3641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), consistent with a dominant-negative disease mechanism.Careful analysis of the NC1 domain crystal structure and molecular modeling studies predict a degree of heterogeneity in the effect of missense mutations on NC1 domain folding and assembly (10Bogin O. Kvansakul M. Rom E. Singer J. Yayon A. Hohenester E. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Marks D.S. Gregory C.A. Wallis G.A.

Accordingly, mutations have been divided into three classes. Class I substitutions (C591R, G595E, Y597H, L614P, and L644R), which prohibit correct NC1 domain folding due to disruption of hydrophobic interactions within the subunit core, are likely to be excluded from collagen X assembly, resulting in haploinsufficiency. Class II mutations (S600P, S671P, and Y598D) are located within the solvent-filled region of the trimer center and may prevent the formation of stable NC1 trimers. However, class III mutations (N617K, G618V, D648G, and W651R) may be tolerated within the structure of the assembled NC1 trimer and perturb collagen X supramolecular assembly or interactions within the cartilage matrix.Although supported by some experimental data, other results are inconsistent with these predictions. For example, in semipermeabilized cells, the N617K substitution results in marked reduction in trimer thermal stability compared with W651R, another class III mutation (18McLaughlin S.H. Conn S.N. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7570-7575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In transfected cells and in a bacterial expression system capable of producing folded NC1 trimers, both Y598D and G618V mutations prevent collagen X assembly (21Wilson R. Freddi S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12516-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Dublet B. Vernet T. van der Rest M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, these data suggest that SMCD mutations that are theoretically tolerated within the native NC1 trimer, such as N617K and G618V, may still, in a cellular context, compromise trimer formation. This raises the possibility that the interaction of NC1 subunits may be altered by subtle conformational changes within structural elements of the NC1 domain apparently not directly involved in monomer or trimer stability.We and others have shown that certain mutant α1(X) collagen chains are selectively degraded and do not interfere with wild-type collagen X secretion (21Wilson R. Freddi S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12516-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F.

This suggests that collagen X assembly is monitored by an efficient quality control mechanism that recognizes misfolded NC1 domains prior to any detrimental effect on normal chain folding. In this study, we have selected SMCD mutations that are predicted either to prohibit subunit folding and assembly (NC1del10 and Y598D, respectively) or to allow trimerization and secretion (N617K and G618V). We have expressed mutant and wild-type collagen X in both 293-EBNA and SaOS-2 cells and found that, like Y598D and NC1del10, the N617K and G618V mutations also prevented efficient secretion. Furthermore, all four SMCD mutations resulted in formation of aberrant disulfide bonds, and expression of mutant collagen X triggered the unfolded protein response. Therefore, this present study is the first to demonstrate a direct link between SMCD mutations and NC1 domain misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Wild-type and Mutant Collagen X Expression Constructs for Stable Transfection—For the stable expression of His6-tagged collagen X in transfected cells, we generated five expression constructs (pCEP4-WT-His, pCEP4-Y598D-His, pCEP4-G618V-His, pCEP4-N617K-His, and pCEP4-NC1del10-His) encoding α1(X) sequences flanked at the N termini by sequences encoding the BM40 signal peptide, a His6 tag, and an enterokinase cleavage site.

This 740-bp fragment was ligated into pCEP4-WT-His from which the equivalent wild-type sequence had been excised by BamHI digestion. The pCEP4-N617K-His construct was created by strand overlap extension PCR using primer set N617K-F (5′-CTGTATAAGAAGGGCACCCCTGTA-3′) and HX6-NotI (5′-GCGGCCGCCTTTTCAGCCTACCTCCATA-3′) or primer set N617K-R (5′-TACAGGGTGCCCTTCTTATACAG-3′) and HX-SP-NotI (5′-GCGGCCGCGTGTTTTACGCTGAACGATA-3′) to generate independent fragments with overlapping sequences. Additional sequences encoding NotI restriction enzyme sites were added to the primers (underlined) to enable subsequent cloning into the plasmid pCEP4-BM40-HisEK (24Bengtsson E. Aspberg A. Heinegard D. Sommarin Y. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40695-40702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All PCRs were performed at 60 °C for 35 cycles using 0.5 units of DeepVent polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.), and PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using QIAquick columns (Qiagen Inc.). Second round PCRs were carried out with primers HX-SP-NotI and HX6-NotI using 5 ng of the primary PCR products as template. The resulting 2-kb recombinant PCR product was digested with NotI, purified, and ligated with pCEP-4-WT-His from which the equivalent wild-type sequence had been excised by NotI digestion. The construct was sequenced to verify the presence of the N617K mutation and to ensure that no PCR errors were introduced.Stable Transfection of 293-EBNA and SaOS-2 Cells—The human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cell line (Invitrogen) and the SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line (HTB-85, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Cells were passaged at a 1:3 ratio ∼24 h prior to transfection to achieve 70% confluency at the time of transfection. For each transfection, 6 μg of collagen X expression construct DNA was combined with 20 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, cells were passaged at a 1:6 ratio into DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Diagnostics) to select for positive transfectants. Cells were maintained in selection medium as a pool of transfectants and seeded simultaneously into 6-well dishes for subsequent mRNA extraction, protein analysis, and collagen X biosynthetic labeling.Northern Blotting and Hybridization Analysis—RNA was prepared from transfected and untransfected cells cultured in 6-well dishes at ∼80% confluence using the RNeasy™ extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.). Electrophoresis, transfer of RNA to nitrocellulose filters, and preparation of a collagen X-specific 32P-labeled probe were performed as described previously (21Wilson R. Freddi S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12516-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Filters were exposed to autoradiography film or visualized by phosphorimaging (STORM™, Amersham Biosciences) where indicated (see “Results”).Biosynthetic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Transfected cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates and incubated for 16 h with 1 ml of methionine- and serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate and 100 μCi of l-[35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, 1032 Ci/mmol; ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.). In pulse-labeling experiments, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 1 ml of methionine- and serum-free DMEM prior to incubation with 100 μCi of l-[35S]methionine for 1 h. After metabolic labeling, the medium was removed, and cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitation of α1(X) collagen chains in cell lysates and media samples was performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the His6 epitope tag (Roche Diagnostics) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml as described previously (21Wilson R. Freddi S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12516-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by heating to 65 °C for 10 min in an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% glycerol and 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue) unless otherwise stated. In all experiments, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% (w/v) acrylamide gels, and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography. For analysis of cell lysates by immunoblotting, cells were grown to confluence in 6-well dishes, lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (21Wilson R. Freddi S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12516-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Soluble proteins were precipitated for 1 h on ice using 9 volumes of ethanol and then recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Proteins were solubilized in 2% (w/v) SDS, and protein concentration measured using the BCA assay (Pierce) to ensure equal loading (0.5 μg of protein/lane). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma) in the presence of 5% (w/v) milk protein. Mouse anti-KDEL monoclonal antibodies (Stressgen Biotech Corp.) were used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, and primary antibodies were detected using a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako Corp.). Rabbit anti-collagen X polyclonal antibodies raised against human recombinant collagen X were used at a dilution of 1:2000 and detected using a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako Corp.). Blots were developed by chemiluminescence (ECL™, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Primer Extension Analysis of Spliced XBP1 Transcripts—Transfected and untransfected cells were grown to confluence in 6-well dishes, and following a 2-h incubation in fresh DMEM containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate, RNA was extracted using the RNeasy™ extraction kit. RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Ambion, Inc.) to remove traces of genomic DNA. To generate PCR products corresponding to the spliced and unspliced forms of the XBP1 transcript, a cDNA template was first synthesized from mRNA with reverse transcriptase and random hexamers (Roche Diagnostics) as primers using 100 ng of total RNA/reaction. With sense (5′-GGAGTTAAGACAGCGCTTGG-3′, bp 401–420) and antisense (5′-ACTGGGTCCAAGTTGTCCAG-3′, bp 648 to 629) primers spanning the XBP1 RNA processing sequence (GenBank™ accession number AB076383), we amplified PCR products corresponding to unspliced and spliced XBP1 (248 and 222 bp, respectively) for 35 PCR cycles using a primer annealing temperature of 60 °C. The products were resolved on 2.5% (w/v) agarose gels and visualized under ultraviolet light. To differentiate between spliced and unspliced XBP1 RNAs by primer extension analysis, we used an 18-mer oligonucleotide (5′-TCTGCTGAGTCCGCAGCA-3′, bp 490–507), which is extended by a single cytosine when annealed to unspliced XBP1 cDNA and by two guanosine nucleotides when annealed to spliced XBP1 cDNA. Template for each reaction was prepared by RT-PCR using the conditions described above. Primer extension reactions were performed essentially as described (17Bateman J.F. Freddi S. Nattrass G. Savarirayan R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using 5 ng of each cDNA template and 2 μCi of either [α-33P]dGTP or [α-33P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The products were resolved on a 15% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, and the radioactivity of the primer extension products was quantified by phosphorimaging.RESULTSEffect of SMCD Point Mutations on Collagen X Secretion in Transfected 293-EBNA Cells—We have recently shown that collagen X chains harboring the SMCD mutation Y598D assemble very poorly in stably transfected cells and are retained and degraded (21Wilson R. Freddi S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12516-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Analysis of the NC1 domain crystal structure revealed that the substitution of Tyr598 with a charged Asp residue would compromise trimer stability by interfering with tight intersubunit assembly (10Bogin O. Kvansakul M. Rom E. Singer J. Yayon A. Hohenester E. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To further investigate the molecular mechanism underlying SMCD, we have analyzed two more SMCD missense mutations, G618V and N617K, which, unlike Y598D, are predicted to permit trimerization of α1(X) collagen chains (10Bogin O. Kvansakul M. Rom E. Singer J. Yayon A. Hohenester E. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Marks D.S. Gregory C.A. Wallis G.A. Brass A. Kadler K.E. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3632-3641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The G618V and N617K substitutions map to the surface of the assembled NC1 trimer and are therefore believed to interfere with subsequent collagen X supramolecular assembly and/or extracellular interactions. For initial transfection experiments, we elected to use the human embryonic kidney cell line 293-EBNA transfected with His6-tagged collagen X cDNAs. Collagenous and non-collagenous human recombinant proteins expressed in 293-EBNA cells undergo post-translational modifications such as N- and O-linked glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, oligomerization, and secretion (25Fichard A.

J. 2002; 367: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).To compare the effects of the missense mutations Y598D, G618V, and N617K on assembly and secretion of α1(X) collagen chains, we transfected 293-EBNA cells with wild-type and mutant collagen X cDNAs. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled for 16 h, and collagen X chains were recovered from cell and media fractions by immunoprecipitation with anti-His6 antibodies. Consistent with previous results in stably transfected cells expressing wild-type and Y598D α1(X) collagen chains (21Wilson R. Freddi S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12516-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the Y598D chains were secreted very poorly in comparison with wild-type chains (Fig. 1a, lanes 5 and 6). After disruption of collagen X immunocomplexes in 2% (w/v) SDS, secreted α1(X) collagen chains migrated as a mixture of trimers and monomers. To confirm that α1(X) collagen chains were secreted only as trimers, we analyzed the medium of 293-EBNA cells expressing wild-type collagen X by ethanol precipitation, followed by denaturation in 1% (w/v) SDS-PAGE buffer (Fig. 1c). We identified a single major protein band at the expected position of the collagen X trimer (lane 1), which dissociated into α1(X) collagen monomers in the presence of trichloroacetic acid (lane 2).Like Y598D, the N617K mutation resulted in very low levels of α1(X) collagen in the medium, and G618V chains were completely absent in the media fractions (Fig. 1a, lanes 6–8). We confirmed that this effect was not due to instability of the mutant transcripts, as comparable levels of expression were identified by Northern analysis (Fig. 1d). Therefore, our data indicate that all three missense mutations inhibit collagen X secretion in 293-EBNA cells.Effect of SMCD Point Mutations on Collagen X Assembly inTransfected 293-EBNA Cells—In addition to the defect in collagen X secretion caused by the three missense mutations, we observed significant differences in trimer stability. In all transfections, a significant fraction of intracellular α1(X) collagen chains migrated as monomers (Fig. 1a, lanes 1–4). The remaining wild-type α1(X) collagen chains migrated as trimers (lane 1). In striking contrast, a very minor fraction of SMCD α1(X) collagen chains migrated as trimers, whereas significant amounts of mutant chains migrated at the expected position of α1(X) collagen dimers (lanes 2–4). To investigate the nature of the interactions contributing to NC1 multimer stability, samples were treated under conditions identical to used in the previous experiment, except for the addition of 20 mm dithiothreitol to the SDS-PAGE buffer. Whereas a similar banding pattern was observed for wild-type chains (Fig. 1, a and b, lane 1), the α1(X) collagen dimers were completely dissociated into monomers under reducing conditions (Fig. 1b, lanes 2–4). This indicates that correctly assembled NC1 subunits are stabilized by noncovalent forces, whereas the SMCD chains form dimers that are linked by disulfide bonds. Our results therefore provide strong evidence that the mutant α1(X) collagen chains misfold into a conformation not adopted by the native NC1 domain, leading to aberrant disulfide bond formation.Misfolding of SMCD Mutant Collagen X Chains in SaOS-2 Cells—One potential limitation of recombinant protein expression in 293-EBNA cells is the very high expression level of the exogenous protein, which may compromise ER quality control. This has been shown in a recombinant collagen VI expression system in which unassembled α1(VI) and α2(VI) collagen chains are secreted (30Tillet E. Wiedemann H. Golbik R. Pan T.C. Zhang R.Z. Mann K.

These receptors show very high affinity for various sigma ligands including neuroleptics like haloperidol. We hypothesized that in associating haloperidol-linked lipid into the cationic lipid-DNA complex, we can specifically target and deliver genes to breast cancer cells that overexpress sigma receptors. In the present study, haloperidol was chemically modified to conjugate at the distal end of the polyethylene glycollinked phospholipid, which was then incorporated into the cationic liposome known to condense and deliver genes inside cells. The resulting haloperidol-conjugated targeted lipoplex showed at least 10-fold higher (p < 0.001) reporter gene expression in MCF-7 cells than control lipoplex. The reporter gene expression of the targeted lipoplex was significantly blocked by haloperidol (p < 0.001) and by another sigma ligand, 1,3-ditolylguanidine (p < 0.001) in the majority of cationic lipid to DNA charge ratios (±). Spironolactone-mediated sigma receptor down-regulation enabled MCF-7 to show 10-fold lower transgene expression with targeted lipoplex compared with that obtained in spironolactone-untreated cells. The targeted lipoplex generated nonspecific gene expression in sigma receptor-nonexpressing human cancer cells such as Hela, KB, HepG2, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Moreover, the transgene expression remained unabated in physiologically relevant serum concentrations.

Haloperidol is a common neuroleptic drug that is subtype non-selective yet shows a strong affinity for sigma receptors. Haloperidol and other sigma ligands have been shown to elicit various physiological processes, which include triggering apoptosis in cells of neuronal origin and in rapidly proliferating cells (1Vilner B.J.

It is evident now that these physiological processes are exerted through haloperidol-sigma receptor interaction. Sigma receptors are membrane-bound protein receptors that are expressed in normal tissues, such as liver, endocrine glands, kidneys, lungs, gonads, central nervous system, and ovaries at basal levels (5Wolfe S Jr A.

Although the physiological roles of these receptors in normal tissues are not yet clear, a diverse set of human tumors, such as melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, breast tumors of neural origin, and prostate cancer overexpress sigma receptors (7Vilner B.J.

Structurally diverse sigma ligands have been shown previously to exhibit high affinity to these sigma receptor-expressing cells, suggesting the prospect of using these sigma receptor binding ligands for diagnosis as tumor-imaging agents and targeted therapy of a variety of tumors (12John C.S.

In cancer-targeting studies, specific targeting to tumor cells by liposomes has previously been demonstrated (14Huang A. Huang L. Kennel S.J. J. Biol.

Recently, a non-immunogenic, small molecular weight sigma ligand carrying an anisamide moiety was used as a targeting ligand in a drug-carrying liposomal system to target anticancer drugs to sigma receptor-expressing prostate cancer cells in the xenograft tumor mice model (19Banerjee R. Tyagi P. Li S. Huang L Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 112: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The above-mentioned study propelled us to investigate the use of a readily available inexpensive generic drug, haloperidol, which shows very high affinity for sigma receptors, as a targeting ligand in a stealth liposomal system carrying genes to sigma receptor-overexpressing breast adenocarcinoma cells. Without potentially reducing targeting ability, the haloperidol is chemically conjugated to phospholipids with a PEG spacer in between. This ligand-conjugated PEG-lipid is included in 5 mol %, along with a known cationic lipid (20Singh R.S. Mukherjee K. Banerjee R. Chaudhuri A. Hait S.K. Moulik S. Ramdas Y. Vijayalakshmi A. Rao N.M. Chem. Eur. J. 2002; 8: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and cholesterol, to form long-lived circulating and targeted cationic liposomes. These cationic liposomes pre-condense plasmid DNA containing the reporter or therapeutic gene. It is expected that haloperidol having high affinity for the sigma receptor, upon incorporation into the surface of the liposome, will avidly interact with cells expressing the sigma receptor. This liposome-cell interaction eventually ferries the genetic cargo inside the cell, possibly through receptor-mediated uptake. As an added advantage, the liposome-DNA complex will remain stabilized because PEG is known to prolong the circulation times of the liposome in vivo (21Klibanov A.L. Maruyama K. Torchilin V.P. Huang L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 22Zalipsky S. Brandeis E. Newman M.S. Woodle M.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, because of the low mol % of haloperidol-associated lipid, the lipoplex is expected to exert minimal agonistic effect, if any, to sigma receptor-expressing cells. To this end, we have incorporated haloperidol-conjugated PEG phospholipid in the cationic liposome formulation and condense reporter plasmid DNA. The targeted uptake followed by the efficiency of reporter gene expression in sigma receptor-overexpressing human breast carcinoma cell MCF-7 was studied in the presence of serum-containing medium and in the absence or presence of free haloperidol and ditolylguanidine. Chemicals and General Procedures—Phospholipids such as DSPE-PEG(2000)-maleimide and DSPE-PEG(2000)-COOH were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Cholesterol, trypsin, EDTA, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and haloperidol (HP) were purchased from Sigma. All the chemicals and organic solvents required for synthesis were purchased from either Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI) or S.D. Fine Chem (Mumbai, India). They were used without further purification. Spironolactone was obtained from the drug aldactone (RPG Life Sciences Ltd., Ankleshwar, India). Briefly, aldactone tablets (50 mg by spironolactone weight) were crushed and dissolved in 10 ml of water. The drug was extracted by dichloromethane (2 × 25 ml). Upon evaporation of the non-aqueous layer, the free drug was crystallized out in methanol at –20 °C. The purity and authenticity of the crystallized compound (white needle, 48 mg) was characterized by TLC, melting point analysis, and by its NMR spectrum. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker FT 300 MHz and Varian FT 200 MHz and 400 MHz instrument. Cell Culture—MCF-7, CHO, Hela, KB, and HepG2 cells were purchased from the National Center for Cell Sciences (Pune, India) and were mycoplasma-free. Cells were cultured in DMEM (ATCC) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cultures of 85–90% confluency were used for all of the experiments. The cells were trypsinized, counted, and subcultured in 96-well plates for transfection and viability studies. The cells were allowed to adhere overnight before they were used for experiments. Synthesis of Ligands—The synthetic procedure for preparing the lipid DSPE-PEG-HP is depicted schematically in Fig. 1. Detailed experimental procedures are delineated below. Step a: Synthesis of N-Boc-β-Alanine-Haloperidol Conjugate (Compound I,Fig. 1)—A mixture of N-Boc β-alanine (400 mg, 2.1 mmol), haloperidol (400 mg, 1 mmol), and N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 20 mg, catalytic) were mixed in a 25-ml round bottom flask in 5 ml of dry DCM and stirred in ice for 0.5 h. To the mixture, EDC (240 mg, 1.2 mmol) was added, and the sample was stirred in an ice bath for 1 h. The reaction mixture was further stirred for 12 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was dissolved in 20 ml of dichloromethane, washed with water (2 × 20 ml), and brine (1 × 20 ml), and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. Column chromatographic purification (using 60–120 mesh silica gel and 2% methanol-chloroform as eluent) of the residue yielded compound I, a white solid (116 mg, 20% yield, Rf 0.6 in 5% methanol/chloroform). 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 1.2 [s, 9H, -(CH3)3C-O-CONH], 1.9 [t, 4H, -CH2-CH2-N-CH2-CH2], 2–2.6 [m, 8H, (CH2)2-N-CH2-CH2-], 2.7 [m, 2H, -O-CO-CH2-CH2-NHBOC], 2.9 [t, 2H, -CH2-COAr], 3.2 [m, 2H, -CH2NHBOC], 4.8–4.9 [bs, 1H, BOC-NH], 6.9–7.2 [m, 6H, o- and m-C6H4-F + o-C6H4-Cl, 8 [m, 2H, o-C6H4-CO]. FABMS (LSIMS): m/z, 547 [M+] for C29H36O5N2ClF. Step b: Boc Deprotection of N-Boc-β-Alanine-Haloperidol Conjugate (Compound II,Fig. 1)—N-Boc-β-alanine-haloperidol conjugate, compound I (intermediate product obtained from step a, 280 mg, 0.6 mmol) was put into a 25-ml round bottom flask and dissolved in 5 ml of 10% trifluoroacetic acid-dichloromethane (v/v). The reaction mixture was stirred over an ice bath for 2 h, and then the solution was neutralized using saturated NaHCO3 solution. The mixture was extracted with DCM (2 × 15 ml), and the organic layer was dried with Na2SO4. Evaporation of the organic layer afforded compound II as a gummy material (160 mg, 70% yield, Rf 0.1 in 5% methanol/chloroform, active in ninhydrin charring). Because compound II was obtained as ∼95% pure (revealed by TLC), it was directly used for the final step. Step c: Synthesis of DSPE-PEG-HP—A mixture of DSPE-PEG(2000)-COOH (50 mg, 0.018 mmol) and compound II (30 mg, 0.06 mmol) were put into a 10-ml round bottom flask in 3 ml of dry DCM and stirred over an ice bath. After 0.5 h, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 5 mg, 0.023 mmol) was added to the reaction, with continued stirring at room temperature for 12 h. The solvent was evaporated, and the crude product was purified three times by recrystallization using methanol/ether (1:15 v/v) as solvent. The purified compound obtained as a white gummy material (38 mg, 66% yield with respect to the PEG-lipid, Rf 0.1 at CHCl3/acetone/methanol 79:20:1, UV active). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD) of representative peaks: δ = 0.9 [t, 6H, O-CO-CH2-(CH2)14CH2CH3, 1.2–1.6 [m, 56H, O-CO-CH2-(CH2)14CH2CH3]], 7.2 [m, 2H, & o-C6H4Cl], 7.4 [m, 4H, o- and m-C6H4F], 8.2 [m, 2H, o-C6H4-CO]. The integration of the protons in the aromatic moiety when attached to the high molecular weight PEG does not give accurate peak heights in contrast to other protons in NMR, as reported elsewhere (23Greenwald R.B. Gilbert C.W. Pendri A. Conover C.D. Xia J. Martinez A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectra of the product revealed an inverted U shape mass spectral pattern with an increment of 44 (a characteristic of PEG-based molecules) spanning between molecular weights 2922 and 3450. The peak of the mass spectral pattern is obtained at molecular weight 3149 (possibly M+2). The starting material DSPE-PEG-COOH shows a pattern spanning between molecular weights 2630 and 2985, with a peak at molecular weight 2718. The peak for the product was considered 3147 [2718 + 429 (contributed from HP)] and was accepted as the molecular weight of the product for the mole calculations hereafter. Liposome Preparations—The lipid films were prepared by drying the chloroform solution, from a total of 2.05 μmol of DODEAC, cholesterol and DSPE-PEG-HP or DSPE-PEG-mal under a gentle stream of N2, under vacuum for at least 6 h. The lipid mixtures were composed of DODEAC/Chol/DSPE-PEG-HP or DODEAC/Chol/DSPE-PEG-mal in a molar ratio of 1:1:0.05. The mixture was hydrated with 1 ml of sterile water overnight and then first subjected to a low intensity bath sonication for 15 min at room temperature and then probe sonication for 2 min in ice using a constant duty cycle and output control magnitude of 2–3 in a Branson Sonifier 450. DNA Binding Assay—The DNA binding ability of the targeted and non-targeted lipids containing DSPE-PEG-HP and DSPE-PEG-mal, respectively, was assessed by gel retardation assay on a 0.8%-agarose gel. 0.40 μg of pCMV-SPORT-β-gal was complexed with the cationic lipids (at a cationic lipid/DNA charge ratio 8:1, 4:1, 2:1, and 1:1) in a total volume of 16 μl of HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min on a rotary shaker. 3 μl of 6× loading buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 40% sucrose) was added, and the total solution was loaded to each well. The samples were electrophoresed at 80 V for ∼2 h, and the DNA bands were visualized by staining for 30 min with ethidium bromide solution followed by 30 min of destaining in water. DNase 1 Sensitivity Assay—In a typical assay, 3 nmol of DNA (1 μg) were complexed with both targeted and non-targeted cationic lipids containing DSPE-PEG-HP and DSPE-PEG-mal, respectively, in a (±) charge ratio of 8:1, 4:1, 2:1, and 1:1. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min on a rotary shaker. Subsequently, the complex was treated with DNase I (at a final concentration of 10 ng/3 nmol of pDNA), in the presence of 20 mm MgCl2. The volume was brought up to 50 μl with HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h. To stop the hydrolysis reaction, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 10 min in a water bath. The aqueous layer was extracted with 50 μl of phenol/chloroform mixture (1:1, v/v) and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The aqueous supernatant was separated, loaded (20 μl) on a 0.8% agarose gel, and electrophoresed at 80 V for 3 h. DNase I-treated and untreated naked DNA were also included in the same experiment. The bands were visualized after 45 min of ethidium bromide staining followed by 30 min of destaining in water. Western Blot Analysis of Sigma Receptors—MCF-7 and CHO cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks until they reached a confluency of about 80%. Cells were detached from the flasks using 0.1% EDTA solution. Whole cell lysates were prepared by directly lysing the cells in SDS loading buffer. Total protein content in each sample was determined by amido black staining (24Sheffield J.B. Graff D. Li H.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were loaded and separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Biosciences) using semidry blotting. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to visualize equal loading of protein samples. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% BLOTTO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blot was then incubated with polyclonal antibody raised against full-length recombinant sigma receptor 1 of human origin in rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:500 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:4000 dilution for 45 min. To confirm equal loading of protein samples, the blot was also probed for levels of β-actin using monoclonal antibody (Sigma) raised in the mouse against β-actin at 1:800 dilution. We used anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) to detect actin. Using the enhanced chemiluminescence method and exposing the membrane to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Company) in a dark room, protein bands were visualized. Gene Transfection—Cells were seeded at a density of 12,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate usually 18–24 h before transfection. 0.30 μg of pCMV-SPORT-β-gal DNA (diluted to 50 μl with DMEM) was complexed with varying amount of cationic liposomes (diluted to 50 μl with plain DMEM) for 30 min. The molar ratios (lipid/DNA) were 8:1, 4:1, 2:1, and 1:1. After complexation was completed, 200 μl of DMEM containing 10% FBS (CM1X) were added to the resulting lipoplexes for triplicate experiments. Thus the final concentration of serum became 6.7%. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (1 × 200 μl) and then with lipoplex (100 μl). After incubation of the cell plates in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 4 h, 100 μl of DMEM containing 10% FBS (CM1X) were added to cells. The reporter gene activity was assayed after 48 h. The medium was removed completely from the wells, and cells were lysed with 50 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) for 30 min. The β-galactosidase activity per well was estimated by adding 50 μlof2× substrate (1.33 mg/ml of ONPG, 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, and 2 mm magnesium chloride) to the cell lysate in the 96-well plate. Absorption of the product ortho-nitrophenol at 405 nm was converted to absolute β-galactosidase units using a calibration curve constructed with commercial β-galactosidase enzyme. For the haloperidol- and DTG-pretreated experiments, cells (in 100 μl of complete medium) were treated either with haloperidol or DTG (in Me2SO) in a final concentration of 20 and 100 μm, respectively, for 2 h. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS (1 × 100 μl). The cells were subsequently treated with the lipoplexes, and the reporter gene assay was performed according to the above-mentioned procedure. For studies with spironolactone-treated MCF-7 cells, the cells were treated with spironolactone at a final concentration of 10 μm in serum medium for 1 day. Microscopically, cells show no change in cellular morphology compared with spironolactone-untreated MCF-7 cells before plating. The cells upon becoming 80–90% confluent were plated in 96-well plates in the presence of spironolactone. The cells were kept in spironolactone-containing medium overnight. The medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS (1 × 100 μl) before lipoplex was added to the cells. The transfection and assay were performed as mentioned before. For the serum dependence study, upon incubation for 30 min in DMEM, 200 μl of either of the following were added to the lipoplex: (a) DMEM, (b) 10% FBS-containing DMEM, (c) 40% FBS-containing DMEM, (d) 80% FBS-containing DMEM, or (e) 100% FBS. 100 μl of each of the 300 μl of resulting complex solution were added to each of the wells of the triplicate experiments, and the cells were incubated for 4 h as described above. The final percentages of serum were 0, 26, 53, and 66, respectively, during incubation. After 4 h the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated in 10% FBS-containing DMEM and were incubated for another 48 h. The cellular assays were done as described previously. The transfection values are reported as the average values of triplicate experiment performed in the same plate on the same day. To verify reproducibility, each transfection experiment in the MCF-7 cell was performed at least four times on four different days. Other cell line data were representative data from at least two transfection experiments. The day to day variations in transfection efficiency were mostly within 2–3-fold and were dependent on the condition of cells. Cell Viability Assay—Cytotoxicity of the cationic lipids was assessed using the MTT reduction assay as described earlier (25Hansen M-B. Neilson S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity assay was performed in 96-well plates, keeping the ratio of number of cells to amount of cationic lipid constant as was maintained in previously described transfection experiments. Briefly, 4 h after the addition of lipoplexes, MTT (5 mg/ml PBS) was added to the cells and was incubated for 3–4 h at 37 °C. Results are expressed as shown in Equation 1. Percent viability=[A550(treated cells)-background]/[A550(untreated cells)-background]×100 eq.1 Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. and statistically analyzed by the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test using Microsoft Excel (Seattle, WA). Data were primarily considered significant if p < 0.001. Synthesis of DSPE-PEG-HP—HP is a very potent sigma drug, which possesses excellent affinity toward both subtypes of sigma receptors. With the help of the β-alanine adduct, HP is suitably modified to conjugate it to the PEG-grafted phospholipid, wherein PEG (Mr 2000) acts as spacer between the lipid and the targeting ligand. The inclusion of the PEG spacer is done to improve the targetability and to provide stealth property to the liposome containing the PEG-lipid. Fig. 1 shows the scheme for the synthesis of haloperidol-derivatized phospholipid. The overall yield for the reactions involved in the suitable modification of HP is 60%, and the final conjugation yield is 70%. Binding Study and DNase I Treatment Study of DNA—The targeted and non-targeted lipoplexes showed practically no difference in their binding property (Fig. 2A). Both the liposomes exhibit comparable affinity and bind to DNA in a similar fashion. At and beyond the 4:1 (±) charge ratio, DNA remains completely complexed with PEG-associated cationic liposomes, whereas at and below the 2:1 (±) charge ratio, a majority of the DNA remains non-complexed. These binding properties are corroborated in the DNase I treatment study of lipoplex (Fig. 2B). The lipoplexes irrespective of the presence of targeted or non-targeted PEG-lipid save DNA from DNase I with similar avidity in a ± charge ratio of 4:1 or greater. Targeted Gene Transfection in MCF-7 Cells—Fig. 3A shows the comparison between reporter gene expression in HP- and DTG-untreated sigma receptor-overexpressing breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells treated with cationic lipoplex, which contain either targeted lipid DSPE-PEG-HP or non-targeted lipid DSPE-PEG-mal. The cells treated with targeted lipoplex express significantly more amounts of reporter gene than that of the non-targeted lipoplex-treated cells. The highest differences in expression (8–12-fold, p < 0.001) were at a cationic lipid/DNA charge ratio of 4:1 and 2:1. Fig. 3A also shows that Lipofectamine™, one of the most frequently used cationic lipid-based gene transfection reagent, has significantly less effect in transfecting DNA in MCF-7 cells; thereby, proving the utility of the DSPE-PEG-HP-containing targeted lipoplex to transfect MCF-7 cells. Fig. 3B shows the comparison between reporter gene expression in MCF-7 cells treated with targeted lipoplex in the absence or presence of either HP or DTG. With a cationic lipid/DNA charge ratio of 4:1 the difference in reporter gene expression is maximum (p < 0.001). With a 2:1 charge ratio, the difference in transgene expression is significant in the case of HP (p < 0.001) and is nearly significant for DTG (p = 0.008). The result proves that the uptake of targeted lipoplex is indeed mediated through sigma receptors. Fig. 3C shows a similar comparison in MCF-7 cells treated with non-targeted cationic lipoplexes in the presence or absence of either HP or DTG. The overall gene expression is severalfold lower compared with that obtained through targeted lipoplex. Simultaneously, there is no consistent evidence of targeted uptake and eventual gene expression in cells treated with non-targeted cationic lipoplex. The gene expression was nonspecific in all the charge ratios and remains uninhibited in the presence of either HP or DTG. Gene Transfection in CHO Cells—CHO, a non-human cell, is known to possess very low levels of sigma receptors (26Mei J. Pasternak G.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is one of the most transfectable cell lines by cationic lipids. Fig. 3D shows the relative comparison between the reporter gene expression in CHO cells treated with targeted cationic lipoplex in the presence or absence of HP. Fig. 3E shows the relative comparison of gene expression in CHO cells treated with non-targeted cationic lipoplex in the presence or absence of HP. The gene expression is relatively high because of known nonspecific cell surface interaction with transfecting cationic lipids. However, the difference in gene expression in cells pretreated or untreated with HP is shown to be mostly insignificant, and no specific comparable trend is observed between cells treated with targeted and non-targeted lipoplexes. Hence, the sigma receptor has no role in targeted lipoplex-mediated gene transfection in CHO. Comparison of Sigma Receptor Levels in MCF-7 and CHO Cells—To correlate the difference in targeted transfection in MCF-7 cells compared with that obtained in CHO with the present levels of sigma receptors in respective cells, a Western blot analysis was undertaken for the cellular proteins of the two cell lines. Fig. 4 shows the Western blot analysis of MCF-7 and CHO for the detection of the sig"

Recently, xanthine oxidase (XO) has been reported to catalyze organic nitrate reduction under anaerobic conditions, but questions remain regarding the initial precursor of nitric oxide (NO) and the link of organic nitrate to the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). To characterize the mechanism of XO-mediated biotransformation of organic nitrate, studies using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, NO electrode, and immunoassay were performed. The XO reducing substrates xanthine, NADH, and 2,3-dihydroxybenz-aldehyde triggered the reduction of organic nitrate to nitrite anion (NO2−). Studies of the pH dependence of nitrite formation indicated that XO-mediated organic nitrate reduction occurred via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. In the absence of thiols or ascorbate, no NO generation was detected from XO-mediated organic nitrate reduction; however, addition of l-cysteine or ascorbate triggered prominent NO generation. Studies suggested that organic nitrite (R-O-NO) is produced from XO-mediated organic nitrate reduction. Further reaction of organic nitrite with thiols or ascorbate leads to the generation of NO or nitrosothiols and thus stimulates the activation of sGC. Only flavin site XO inhibitors such as diphenyleneiodonium inhibited XO-mediated organic nitrate reduction and sGC activation, indicating that organic nitrate reduction occurs at the flavin site. Thus, organic nitrite is the initial product in the process of XO-mediated organic nitrate biotransformation and is the precursor of NO and nitrosothiols, serving as the link between organic nitrate and sGC activation.

The beneficial effects of organic nitrates result primarily from their vasodilator properties, which have been attributed to their metabolic product, nitric oxide (NO) (1Arnold W.P. Mittal C.K.

In 1998, the Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of “nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system.” It is well known that organic nitrates require enzymatic metabolism to generate bioactive NO; however, the molecular mechanisms of their biotransformation have not been fully elucidated.It has been reported that flavoenzymes play important roles in the bioactivation of organic nitrates (5Blehert D.S.

XO plays a variety of important roles in normal physiology and disease, and it is the only identified enzyme that can mediate organic nitrate and inorganic nitrate/nitrite reduction (11Li H.

It has been reported that XO can catalyze organic nitrate reduction to nitrite anion (NO–2) under anaerobic conditions (13Doel J.J. Godber B.L. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1527: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but questions remain concerning the initial product, the precursor of NO, and the link of organic nitrate to the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Thus, there is a need to characterize the process of XO-mediated organic nitrate bioactivation, and this should provide broader insights regarding bioactivation of organic nitrates by other enzymes as well.Normally, NO–2 has been assumed to be the initial product of organic nitrate metabolism and the precursor of NO that accounts for organic nitrate bioactivity. However, controversies remain whether inorganic nitrite is an active intermediate in the vascular metabolism of organic nitrate to form NO (15Kowaluk E.A. Chung S.J. Fung H.L. Drug Metab.

It has been questioned how the low micromolar to nanomolar levels of GTN in tissues can produce sufficient inorganic nitrite to serve as an intermediate to generate the levels of NO required to induce significant vasodilatory effects (21Kleschyov A.L.

Additional studies have shown that the magnitude and time course of GTN-mediated NO–2 formation in tissues make it impossible for GTN to act via liberation of nitrite (15Kowaluk E.A. Chung S.J.

Thus, the link between organic nitrate and sGC activation remains elusive and is the most puzzling issue regarding the mechanism of organic nitrate biotransformation.The literature is replete with conflicting observations concerning the role of thiols in the biotransformation of organic nitrate. Previous studies show that the bioactivation of organic nitrate involves thiols or sulfhydryl-containing compounds, and the repeated administration of organic nitrate causes sulfhydryl depletion and consequent tolerance to further vasodilation (25Hutter J. Schmidt M. Rittler J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 156: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 26Needleman P. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1973; 184: 709-715PubMed Google Scholar, 27Needleman P. Jakschik B. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1973; 187: 324-331PubMed Google Scholar, 28Winniford M.D. Kennedy P.L. Wells P.J. Hillis L.D. Circulation. 1986; 73: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, other investigators have shown that there is no correlation between the concentration of endogenous thiols and the state of tolerance (29Gruetter C.A. Lemke S.M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1986; 64: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7816-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular mechanism of the interaction between organic nitrate and thiols to generate NO and S-nitrosothiol remains unclear.To characterize the mechanism of XO-catalyzed organic nitrate reduction and elucidate the precise molecular mechanism of organic nitrate bioactivation in biological systems, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, NO electrode, and immunoassay studies were performed under anaerobic conditions to characterize the initial product, the precursor of NO and nitrosothiol, and to determine the link between organic nitrate and sGC activation. These results demonstrate that XO catalyzes the bioactivation of organic nitrate to form NO and nitrosothiols in a thiol-dependent reaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Xanthine oxidase from buttermilk (xanthine: oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.3.22), xanthine, oxypurinol, DPI, sodium nitrite, Griess Reagent, β-NADH, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 2,3-dihydroxybenz-aldehyde (DBA) were obtained from Sigma. Soluble guanylyl cyclase was obtained from Alexis Biochemical Corp. (San Diego, CA). Direct cGMP assay kit was obtained from Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI), and cGMP production was quantified by immunoassay according to the protocol provided by the company. GTN was synthesized as described previously (9Meah Y. Brown B.J. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8560-8565Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). N-Methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD) was synthesized using carbon disulfide and N-methyl-d-glucamine (31Shinobu L.A. Jones S.G. Jones M.M. Acta Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1984; 54: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 32Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol.

Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Invitrogen. Millipore ultra free centrifugal filter (nominal molecular weight limit 10,000) was obtained from Fisher.EPR Spectroscopy—EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker EMX spectrometer with HS resonator operating at X-band. Measurements were performed at ambient temperature with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 2.5 G, and a microwave power of 20 milliwatts. NO generated by XO-catalyzed reduction of organic nitrate was purged out using argon to a vessel that contained the spin-trap Fe2+-MGD, as described previously (14Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16939-16946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This setup was designed to isolate the reaction solution from spin trap and thus avoid any possible perturbation caused by the reaction of (MGD)2-Fe2+ with nitrite or with the enzyme. Fe2+-MGD complexes were prepared by adding solid ferrous ammonium sulfate and MGD (molar ratio, 1:5) to the deoxygenated (argon-purged) solution with a final concentration of 2 mm iron. Quantitation of NO formation and trapping were performed by double integration of observed EPR signal with comparison to that from the similar aqueous NO-Fe-MGD standard (14Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16939-16946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Chemiluminescence Measurements—The rate of the NO production was measured using a Sievers 270B nitric oxide analyzer interfaced through a DT2821 A to D board to a personal computer. In the analyzer, NO is reacted with ozone forming excited-state NO2, which emits light. Mixing of reagents and separation of NO from the reaction mixture were done at controlled temperature in a glass-purging vessel equipped with heating jacket. An ice-water cooling condenser was attached to the top of the vessel to reduce the outflow of vapors during purging. The release of NO was quantified by analysis of the digitally recorded signal from the photomultiplier tube using specially designed data acquisition and analysis software developed in our laboratory (33Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After an initial 60 s of equilibration of flow from the purging vessel to the detector, the signal provides the rate of NO formation over time.As described previously, nitrite in the solution is measured from its reduction to NO under conditions of acidic pH in the presence of glacial acetic acid and 1% KI (12Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This method has been shown to be highly sensitive, enabling detection of nitrite down to picomole amounts (33Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Neither GTN nor ISDN was found to generate any detectable NO under these conditions. XO-dependent nitrite generation was calculated by subtracting nitrite production without addition of XO (control). Calibration of the magnitude of nitrite and NO production was determined from the integral of the signal over time compared with that from nitrite concentration standards (12Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Electrochemical Measurements—Electrochemical measurements of NO generation by XO under anaerobic conditions were carried out at 37 °C in a sealed electrochemical vial using a CHI 832 electrochemical detector (CH Instruments, Inc., Cordova, IN) and a Clark-type NO electrode (ISO-NOP; Word Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). A slow flow of argon gas was maintained in the space above the solution. The electrochemical detector continuously recorded the current through the working electrode, which is proportional to the NO concentration in the solution. The sensor was calibrated before and after experiments with known concentrations of NO, using NO equilibrated solutions.Assay of S-Nitrosothiol—The concentrations of S-nitrosothiol were determined from the increase of nitrite concentration after treatment of samples with HgCl2. Spectrophotometric quantitation of nitrite with Griess Reagent was performed according to the protocol provided by Sigma, using a Varian Cary 300 UV-visible spectrophotometer. One milliliter of sample was supplemented with 50 μl of 10 mm HgCl2 and 1 ml of Griess Reagent for 10 min at room temperature. Background levels of nitrite in the samples were determined by using Griess Reagent without addition of HgCl2. The standard curve was obtained with a known amount of nitrite.Immunoassay of Guanylyl Cyclase Activity—Activation of soluble sGC by XO-mediated organic nitrate reduction was investigated by employing enzyme-linked immunoassay. After incubation of XO (0.04 mg/ml) and GTN (10 μm)/or ISDN (100 μm) with 1 ml of reaction buffer (10 ng of sGC, 10% BSA, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 1 mm NADH/or 20 μm xanthine in 1 ml of PBS) at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions, the enzymes in the samples were removed using Millipore filter by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The measurements of cGMP in the solution were performed using direct cGMP assay kit by immunoassay according to the manufacturer's product protocol (Assay Designs, Inc.). The standard curve was obtained with known amounts of cGMP.Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of at least three repeated measurements, and statistical significance of difference was evaluated by Student's t test. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.RESULTSInorganic Nitrite Generation from XO-mediated Organic Nitrate Reduction—It has been reported that XO can catalyze organic nitrate reduction to NO–2 (13Doel J.J. Godber B.L. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1527: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of NO–2 generation, as well as its possible role as an intermediate of NO in the process of XO-mediated organic nitrate reduction, the rate of nitrite formation derived from XO-catalyzed GTN and ISDN reduction was measured under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). In the presence of GTN (10 μm) or ISDN (100 μm) and reducing substrates DBA (0.5 mm), xanthine (20 μm), or NADH (1.0 mm), after addition of XO, the reaction mixture was sampled every 2 min, and its nitrite concentration was determined by NO analyzer with reduction of nitrite to NO using 1% KI under acidic conditions. With FAD site-binding substrate NADH as an electron donor, nitrite concentrations in the reaction mixture linearly increase for the first 10 min and then gradually plateau by 30 min (Fig. 1, c). With xanthine or DBA that provides electrons to XO at the molybdenum site, the increase in nitrite concentrations plateaus within 20 min, and a quicker decrease in nitrite generation rates is seen (Fig. 1, a and b).For xanthine as reducing substrate, the initial rate of XO-mediated nitrite formation was determined as a function of GTN or ISDN concentration, and Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed with correlation coefficient γ2 > 99% (Fig. 2, A and B). The apparent Km and Vmax values are shown inside each curve. The apparent Km values of GTN (0.49 mm) and ISDN (1.64 mm) are far higher than the clinical levels of organic nitrates in tissues or blood. Thus, at pharmacological levels in the range of 10–100 μm, the rate of XO-mediated organic nitrate reduction would be expected to increase linearly with the given organic nitrate dose. From this kinetic data, it is possible to predict the magnitude of XO-mediated nitrite formation as a function of organic nitrate and to determine the quantitative importance of this mechanism of nitrite generation and its subsequent NO generation in a given biological system where these substrate levels are known.Fig. 2Kinetics of XO-mediated nitrite generation as a function of GTN or ISDN concentration using xanthine as reducing substrate. Measurements were performed under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C in PBS, pH 7.4, using 0.04 mg/ml XO and 20 μm xanthine. A shows the initial rate of nitrite generation in the presence of GTN (0.01–3 mm); B shows the initial rate of nitrite generation in the presence of ISDN (0.1–10 mm). For each graph, the corresponding fitting (solid lines), Km, and Vmax were obtained using data the Michaelis-Menten equation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Under ischemic conditions, in addition to marked hypoxia, marked intracellular acidosis also occurs, and pH values in tissues, such as the heart, can fall to levels of 6.0 or below (35Zweier J.L. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In order to assess the nitrite formation under different physiological or pathological conditions and to further characterize the mechanism of XO-catalyzed organic nitrate reduction, experiments were performed to measure the effects of different pH values on the magnitude of nitrite generation. Because the apparent Km of organic nitrates is far higher than the pharmacological levels of organic nitrates in tissues or blood, we evaluated the effect of pH on XO-mediated organic nitrate reduction with a typical pharmacological level of 10 μm GTN or 100 μm ISDN. As shown in Table I, it was observed for each of the three reducing substrates (xanthine, NADH, and DBA) that under acidic conditions, increased XO-mediated nitrite generation occurs. In contrast, under alkaline conditions, decreased nitrite generation was seen.Table IEffect of pH on nitrite generation rateNitrite generation ratepH 6.0pH 7.4pH 8.0nmol·mg-1·s-1nmol·mg-1·s-1nmol·mg-1·s-1NADH (1 mm) + GTN (10 μm)0.11 ± 0.020.06 ± 0.010.04 ± 0.01NADH (1 mm) + ISDN (100 μm)0.21 ± 0.030.10 ± 0.010.06 ± 0.01Xanthine (20 μm) + GTN (10 μm)0.56 ± 0.070.31 ± 0.030.17 ± 0.02Xanthine (20 μm) + ISDN (100 μm)0.77 ± 0.070.46 ± 0.060.22 ± 0.03DBA (0.5 mm) + GTN (10 μm)0.33 ± 0.050.17 ± 0.030.10 ± 0.02DBA (0.5 mm) + ISDN (100 μm)0.56 ± 0.070.32 ± 0.040.16 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Nitric Oxide Generation from XO-mediated GTN or ISDN Reduction—It is well known that organic nitrates such as GTN and ISDN are prodrugs requiring metabolism to generate bioactive NO. In order to investigate whether XO can directly catalyze the reduction of GTN and ISDN to NO and quantitate the rates of NO generation, EPR spectroscopy was applied to measure GTN- and ISDN-mediated NO generation under anaerobic conditions. NO generated by organic nitrate was purged out using argon to a purging vessel that contained the spin-trap Fe2+-MGD. NO is paramagnetic and binds with high affinity to the water-soluble spin trap Fe2+-MGD forming the mononitrosyl iron complex NO-Fe2+-MGD with characteristic triplet spectrum at g = 2.04 and hyperfine splitting aN = 12.8. From the intensity of the observed spectrum, quantitative measurement of NO generation can be performed (36Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

With ISDN (100 μm) or GTN (10 μm), in the presence of XO (0.04 mg/ml) and NADH (1 mm), no signal was seen (Fig. 3, spectra A and B). This demonstrates that no significant NO formation occurs.Fig. 3EPR measurement of NO generated from XO under anaerobic conditions. XO (0.04 mg/ml) and 1 mm NADH were incubated in PBS buffer with 10% BSA, pH 7.4, at 37 °C with the following: spectrum A, ISDN (100 μm); spectrum B, GTN (10 μm); spectrum C, ISDN (100 μm) and 5 mm l-cysteine; spectrum D, GTN (10 μm) and l-cysteine (5 mm); and spectrum E, ISDN (100 μm), l-cysteine (5 mm), and DPI (100 μm). NO was continuously purged using argon into a trap vessel containing 5 ml of 2 mm (MGD)2-Fe2+. Samples were taken from the trap vessel after 30 min, and spectra of (MGD)2-Fe2+-NO adducts formed are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been reported that sulfhydryl (–SH) compounds are needed for GTN activation and that repeated administration of GTN causes sulfhydryl depletion and consequent tolerance to further vasodilatation (25Hutter J.

To test whether sulfhydryl compounds play a role in XO-mediated transformation of organic nitrates, l-cysteine (5 mm) was added, and this triggered marked NO generation from 100 μm ISDN with 0.28 μm NO trapped over 30 min (Fig. 3, spectrum C) and from 10 μm GTN with 0.22 μm NO trapped over 30 min (Fig. 3, spectrum D). The XO molybdenum site inhibitor oxypurinol (100 μm) could not inhibit this NO generation from GTN or ISDN (data not shown); however, the FAD site inhibitor DPI (100 μm) effectively blocked XO-dependent NO formation (Fig. 3, spectrum E). This suggests that organic nitrate reduction takes place at the FAD site of XO.In order to further investigate XO-mediated GTN and ISDN reduction and quantitate the rates of NO generation, studies were performed using a chemiluminescence NO analyzer. NO was purged from the solution by argon and then reacted with ozone in the analyzer to form an excited-state NO2, which emits light. This method provides direct measurement of the rate of NO generation as a function of time. With GTN (10 μm), in the presence of xanthine (20 μm) or NADH (1 mm) with XO (0.04 mg/ml), no measurable rate of NO formation was observed (Fig. 4, trace D). To test the effect of sulfhydryl compounds on GTN reduction, l-cysteine (5 mm) was added, and prominent NO generation was triggered (Fig. 4, traces A and B). In the absence of XO, cysteine alone reacted with GTN to produce NO, but only trace production was seen (Fig. 4, trace C).Fig. 4Measurement of the rate of NO generation from XO catalyzed GTN reduction.

These bacteria have a gene encoding a putative avidin- and streptavidin-like protein, which bears an amino acid sequence identity of only about 30% over the core regions with both of them. We produced this protein in Escherichia coli both as the full-length wild type and as a C-terminally truncated core form and showed that it is indeed a high affinity biotin-binding protein that resembles (strept)avidin structurally and functionally. Because of the considerable dissimilarity in the amino acid sequence, however, it is immunologically very different, and polyclonal rabbit and human antibodies toward (strept)avidin did not show significant cross-reactivity with it. Therefore this new avidin, named bradavidin, facilitates medical treatments such as targeted drug delivery, gene therapy, and imaging by offering an alternative tool for use if (strept)avidin cannot be used, because of a deleterious patient immune response for example. In addition to its medical value, bradavidin can be used both in other applications of avidin-biotin technology and as a source of new ideas when creating engineered (strept)avidin forms by changing or combining the desired parts, interface patterns, or specific residues within the avidin protein family. Moreover, the unexpected discovery of bradavidin indicates that the group of new and undiscovered bacterial avidin-like proteins may be both more diverse and more common than hitherto thought.

In addition to chicken avidin and streptavidin, the existing, rather thoroughly characterized avidin protein pool for medical purposes includes poultry avidins, of which duck, goose, and ostrich avidin (4.Hytönen V.P. Laitinen O.H. Grapputo A. Kettunen A. Savolainen J. Kalkkinen N. Marttila A.T. Nordlund H.R. Nyholm T.K. Paganelli G. Kulomaa M.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 219-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in particular have been shown in vitro to be potential alternatives for patients who have strong immunological response toward (strept)avidin because of usually repeated treatments. Some of the AVR proteins (6.Laitinen O.H. Hytönen V.P. Ahlroth M.K. Pentikäinen O.T. Gallagher C. Nordlund H.R. Ovod V. Marttila A.T. Porkka E. Heino S. Johnson M.S. Airenne K.J. Kulomaa M.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) might also prove usable instead of or before (strept)avidin in sequential pretargeting radioimmunotherapy treatments, if they turn out to be immunologically different enough in vivo and show no significant cross-reactivity with the antibodies elicited in the possible preceding steps. Furthermore, differences in pharmacokinetics and other properties because of, for example, varied glycosylation patterns and protein pI (24.Rosebrough S.F. Hartley D.F. J. Nucl. Med. 1996; 37: 1380-1384PubMed Google Scholar), can be exploited when selecting avidins for specific applications. However, as all these biotin-binding proteins are xenoproteins and there is no avidin analog of human origin, they are likely to be antigenic and therefore cannot be used effectively on successive occasions with the same patient. Therefore, an immediate need exists for new and dissimilar avidins, such as the characterized bradavidin and others discussed in this report. Production and Purification of Bradavidin—The gene coding for bradavidin (DDBJ AP005955.1) was amplified by PCR using Bradyrhizobium japonicum genomic DNA as a template and was extended using stepwise elongation of sequence (SES)-PCR (25.Majumder K. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to include attL recombination sites at both ends (26.Hartley J.L. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Two constructs were generated: the full-length wild type (138 amino acid residues) and a C-terminally truncated core form (118 amino acid residues). Both constructs also contained their innate signal peptides (25 amino acid residues). These constructs were then transferred to pBVboostFG vector 1Laitinen, O. H., Airenne, K. J., Hytönen, V.

(2005) Nucleic Acids Res., in press. using the site-specific recombination-based Gateway method (Invitrogen). The resulting expression vectors were confirmed to be as designed by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli BL-21(AI) cells (Invitrogen) were used for protein expression as described previously (27.Hytönen V.P. Laitinen O.H. Airenne T.T. Kidron H. Meltola N.J. Porkka E. Hörhä J.

The recombinant proteins were isolated from bacterial cell extracts by affinity chromatography on 2-iminobiotin agarose column (27.Hytönen V.P. Laitinen O.H. Airenne T.T. Kidron H. Meltola N.J.

J. 2004; 384: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie staining of the gels. Protein concentrations were determined using the calculated extinction coefficient 39 380 m–1 cm–1 for both bradavidins at 280 nm (28.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Primary Structure Analysis—Pairwise sequence alignments were done using the Needle program from the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS), and the ClustalW program was used to generate the multiple sequence alignment (29.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar). The theoretic biochemical properties were determined using the ProtParam program (28.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). The putative signal peptide cleavage site was determined by the SignalP 3.0 program (30.Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5643) Google Scholar). Analysis of Function and Properties—The dissociation rate constant of [3H]biotin (Amersham Biosciences) from the bradavidins and avidin was measured at various temperatures as described in detail previously (31.Klumb L.A. Chu V. Stayton P.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7657-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate of a fluorescent biotin conjugate (ArcDia BF560™-biotin) was measured, as described previously (27.Hytönen V.P. Laitinen O.H. Airenne T.T. Kidron H. Meltola N.J. Porkka E. Hörhä J. Paldanius T. Määttä J.A. Nordlund H.R. Johnson M.S. Salminen T.A. Airenne K.J. Ylä-Herttuala S. Kulomaa M.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), at 50 °C. The purified proteins were analyzed by gel filtration using a Shimadzu HPLC instrument equipped with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) with 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer (pH 11) with 150 mm NaCl as the liquid phase. The column was calibrated using a marker mixture (thyroglobulin, IgG, ovalbumin, myoglobin, vitamin B12; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and bovine serum albumin (Roche Diagnostics) as molecular mass standards. The thermal stability characteristics of the proteins were studied using an SDS-PAGE-based method as described previously in detail (32.Bayer E.A. Ehrlich-Rogozinski S. Wilchek M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Antibody Recognition—Serum samples from cancer patients exposed to avidin and streptavidin were used to compare the immunological properties of the avidins. The serum samples as well as the negative control sera from persons not exposed to (strept)avidin were obtained from the Division of Nuclear Medicine, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy. The analysis was performed similarly as described previously (4.Hytönen V.P. Laitinen O.H. Grapputo A. Kettunen A. Savolainen J. Kalkkinen N. Marttila A.T. Nordlund H.R. Nyholm T.K. Paganelli G. Kulomaa M.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 219-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immobilizer™ Amino plates (Nalge Nunc Int.) were coated with the proteins under study (10 μg/ml) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, agitated for 1 h at room temperature, and blocked with PBS-T 2The abbreviation used is: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. (PBS plus Tween 20, 0.05% v/v). The serum samples were diluted 1:100 in PBS-T and incubated in the wells for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS-T, polyvalent anti-human immunoglobulin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody (dilution 1:6000; 1 h, 37 °C) followed by six washes with PBS-T. Finally, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml, Sigma) was used as a substrate molecule, and a plate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 405 nm. Proteins were further compared using polyclonal rabbit antibodies produced against avidin (University of Oulu, Finland) and streptavidin (a generous gift from Edward A. Bayer, Weissman Institute, Jerusalem, Israel). Proteins were first attached to Immobilizer™ Amino plates as described above and blocked with PBS-T. Antibodies were diluted 1:2000 to PBS-T and applied to the protein-coated plates (1 h, 37 °C). After washing with PBS-T, goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad Laboratories) diluted 1:2000 in PBS-T was used as a secondary antibody (1 h, 37 °C), and the signal was measured as described above. Production and Purification of Bradavidin—Two forms of bradavidin, the full-length wild type and a C-terminally truncated core (analogous to streptavidin core), were produced in E. coli with their innate signal peptides. After one-step purification on 2-iminobiotin agarose column, the eluted proteins appeared to be pure and virtually homogenous, as only one band/lane of the expected size was observed on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Primary Structure Analysis—Pairwise sequence alignment for mature core regions of avidin and bradavidin revealed that 29.2% of the amino acids are identical and 39.2% similar, whereas with streptavidin these values are 30.2 and 41.7%, respectively. Interestingly, when avidin and streptavidin were compared equivalently, the values obtained, 31.9 and 45.2%, were only slightly higher. Multiple sequence alignment of streptavidin, bradavidin, and avidin (Fig. 1) revealed that most of the conserved residues are directly involved in biotin binding in avidin and streptavidin or are structurally important characteristics in the avidin protein family (33.Weber P.C. Ohlendorf D.H. Wendoloski J.J. Salemme F.R. Science. 1989; 243: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 34.Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Over the plausible biotin-binding residues bradavidin bears a slightly closer resemblance to streptavidin than avidin. Bradavidin has two cysteine residues which, according to the known avidin structure (34.Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), could form an intramonomeric disulfide bridge spatially different from that in chicken avidin, whereas streptavidin is devoid of cysteines. In line with this understanding, we observed only monomeric forms in the SDS-PAGE samples boiled in sample buffer without the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2), indicating that bradavidin does not have intermonomeric disulfide bridges analogous to those present in engineered avidin forms (35.Reznik G.O.

According to the results (Table I, Fig. 3), the faster dissociation rate measured from bradavidin indicates weaker affinity toward radiobiotin than that found in avidin and streptavidin. However, bradavidin showed a clearly slower rate of fluorescent biotin displacement than did avidin, thus proving to be almost as extreme a biotin conjugate binder as streptavidin (37.Pazy Y.

Open table in a new tab Gel filtration chromatography showed that bradavidin is a homogenous tetramer, and both forms appeared as a single symmetrical and sharp peak on the chromatograms. SDS-PAGE stability analysis confirmed the tetrameric appearance. These oligomeric assemblies showed comparable stability with that of avidin and streptavidin (Table I). Antibody Recognition—Immunological cross-reactivity of bradavidin with human and rabbit serum antibodies, elicited toward avidin and streptavidin, was analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The avidin protein under inspection was first immobilized on the plate followed by the antiserum and alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 4). Samples from cancer patients exposed to avidin and streptavidin recognized avidin and, even more clearly, streptavidin. This may stem not only from the number and extent of medical treatments but also from the fact that streptavidin is more antigenic than avidin (38.Chinol M. Casalini P. Maggiolo M. Canevari S. Omodeo E.S. Caliceti P. Veronese F.M. Cremonesi M. Chiolerio F. Nardone E. Siccardi A.G. Paganelli G. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39.Paganelli G. Chinol M. Maggiolo M. Sidoli A. Corti A. Baroni S. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 1997; 24: 350-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). None of the patient sera showed a significant response toward bradavidin, which clearly indicates that this protein is largely devoid of common epitopes with (strept)avidin. In addition to human samples, polyclonal rabbit antibodies recognized only the protein toward which they had been elicited in the first place. Bradavidin was also probed by polyclonal rabbit antibodies against (strept)avidin on Western blots, with only the positive (strept)avidin controls being detected after immunostaining. Preceding that step, when the nitrocellulose filter was stained with Ponceau S dye, wild-type bradavidin was clearly visible at the expected location, whereas the bradavidin core appeared to be virtually absent from the blot at this stage (data not shown). This behavior may result from the rather low pI of the core form (Table I), as has also been suspected, for example, in the case of the acidic natural rubber latex allergen Hev b5 (40.Akasawa A. Hsieh L.S. Martin B.M. Liu T. Lin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25389-25393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Comparison of New Potential Avidins—A multiple sequence alignment of many known avidin-like proteins (6.Laitinen O.H. Hytönen V.P. Ahlroth M.K. Pentikäinen O.T. Gallagher C. Nordlund H.R. Ovod V.

The majority of the putative biotin-binding residues, according to the avidin (34.Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and streptavidin (33.Weber P.C. Ohlendorf D.H. Wendoloski J.J. Salemme F.R. Science. 1989; 243: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) structures, were conserved, albeit the overall sequence similarity was rather low (Fig. 5). Conserved structural characteristics of the avidin fold (42.Flower D.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were also observed in the sequences, which further supports our assumptions. However, at present we have more sequence data and experimental knowledge of these proteins at our disposal than Flower (42.Flower D.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) had when he originally determined the structural signature for avidin. Therefore we may be able to both extend and circumscribe the essential characteristics of the avidin fingerprint. Biotin is an essential cofactor in many vital biochemical reactions (43.Wood H.G. Barden R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 385-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 44.Samols D. Thornton C.G. Murtif V.L. Kumar G.K. Haase F.C. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6461-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it is understandable that (strept)avidin can work as a broad-range antimicrobial agent by forming a biotin-free zone or protective barrier around an organism or, for example, an egg possessing the biotin-binding protein (41.Green N.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). The biological role of bradavidin could also be protective, as it proved to be a high affinity biotin-binding protein. If the B. japonicum-containing root nodules on soybeans are found to express, possibly upon injury or infection, and contain or secrete at least a small amount of bradavidin among other defense proteins and compounds, the plant could be resistant toward many invaders. These could include harmful soil microbes, insects, and even higher animals. Experiments on transgenic corn have shown that the expression of avidin in the plant has an enormous impact on the majority of insect pests, particularly at certain developmental stage of the larvae (45.Morgan T.D. Oppert B. Czapla T.H. Kramer K.J. Entomol. Exp. Appl. 1993; 69: 97-108Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 46.Kramer K.J. Morgan T.D. Throne J.E. Dowell F.E. Bailey M. Howard J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the biological role suggested here for bradavidin is only hypothetical, and a bradavidin knock-out, B. japonicum, could give valuable information on this matter. In addition it would be interesting to exchange the bradavidin gene in B. japonicum with a different and even engineered avidin form displaying, for example, better ligand affinity, enhanced stability, or some other special property (such as the peculiar DNA-protein interaction or the lack of such trait, described recently for chicken avidin (47.Morpurgo M. Radu A. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). Although avidin and streptavidin are structurally and functionally similar, their pharmacokinetic characteristics differ radically (24.Rosebrough S.F. Hartley D.F. J. Nucl. Med. 1996; 37: 1380-1384PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Schechter B. Silberman R. Arnon R. Wilchek M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 49.Rosebrough S.F. Nucl. Med. Biol. 1993; 20: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both glycosylation and high pI are thought to cause the rapid clearance of avidin from the blood. It has been found that glycosylation causes avidin accumulation in the liver, and the high pI is responsible for the avidin accumulation in the kidneys (50.Yao Z. Zhang M. Sakahara H. Nakamoto Y. Higashi T. Zhao S. Sato N. Arano Y. Konishi J. J. Nucl. Med. 1999; 40: 479"
https://openalex.org/W2052703427,"RecG differs from most helicases acting on branched DNA in that it is thought to catalyze unwinding via translocation of a monomer on dsDNA, with a wedge domain facilitating strand separation. Conserved phenylalanines in the wedge are shown to be critical for DNA binding. When detached from the helicase domains, the wedge bound a Holliday junction with high affinity but failed to bind a replication fork structure. Further stabilizing contacts are identified in full-length RecG, which may explain fork binding. Detached from the wedge, the helicase region unwound junctions but had extremely low substrate affinity, arguing against the “classical inchworm” mode of translocation. We propose that the processivity of RecG on branched DNA substrates is dependent on the ability of the wedge to establish strong binding at the branch point. This keeps the helicase motor in contact with the substrate, enabling it to drive dsDNA translocation with high efficiency.

This keeps the helicase motor in contact with the substrate, enabling it to drive dsDNA translocation with high efficiency. Helicases are ubiquitous enzymes essential in all stages of DNA and RNA metabolism, including replication, transcription, recombination, and repair (1.Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 2.Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). They are motor proteins that generally translocate along one or both strands of dsDNA, 1The abbreviations used are: ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; RF, replication fork. 1The abbreviations used are: ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; RF, replication fork. dsRNA, or a DNA-RNA hybrid in an ATP-dependent manner and separate some or all parts of the molecule into its component strands. Some enzymes are highly processive, driving strand separation for long distances without dissociating from the template, a property that is especially important for enzymes involved in chromosome replication (3.Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).A variety of mechanisms has evolved to ensure processivity. The prokaryotic helicase DnaB, for example, forms a hexameric ring that completely encircles the DNA, which allows one-dimensional motion while preventing dissociation (4.Kaplan D.L. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5.Kaplan D.L. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Such a strategy is common to many of the hexameric helicases (6.Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Other helicases are thought to achieve the same effect by interacting with the “sliding clamp” that encircles the DNA strands during replication. Examples include Wrn and Rrm3, which have been shown to have enhanced processivity in the presence of PCNA (7.Schmidt K.H. Derry K.L. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45331-45337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8.Lebel M. Spillare E.A. Harris C.C. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37795-37799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The RecC component of the RecBCD helicase has no helicase activity in itself, but its role may be similar to a sliding clamp, preventing dissociation of the RecBCD complex from the DNA (9.Phillips R.J. Hickleton D.C. Boehmer P.E. Emmerson P.T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 319-329PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2004; 432: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).A second strategy is for the helicase to have two binding sites, such that one site can release and move along the strand while the second stays bound. This can be achieved by having a dimeric structure, with one binding site per monomer and has led to the proposal of the “hand over hand” or “rolling” method. Rep helicase is thought to translocate using this mechanism (12.Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The Rep dimer binds to DNA, with one monomer behind the other. ATP hydrolysis alters the conformation of the helicase, radically changing the position of one monomer relative to the other, as well as causing a change in its nucleic acid binding properties (12.Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 13.Cheng W. Hsieh J. Brendza K.M. Lohman T.M. J. Mol.

Nature. 2002; 419: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This movement means the second monomer can now bind the DNA in front of the first monomer, and thus translocation is achieved.An alternative method, which does not rely on a dimeric structure, is the “inchworm” method of translocation. This also requires at least two binding sites, but they can be within a single monomer. The best characterized example of this is in PcrA helicase (15.Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 16.Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The PcrA helicase region contains two RecA-like helicase domains, 1A and 2A, that move relative to each other on ATP binding and hydrolysis. The two domains bind ssDNA bases in pockets that open and close with this conformational change. Initially the ssDNA is bound tightly by domain 1A. ATP binding causes the pockets in domain 2A to open, binding the ssDNA, while the pockets in domain 1A close, releasing ssDNA. At the same time, the two domains move closer together. Upon ATP hydrolysis, the pockets in 1A open, binding ssDNA, and the pockets in 2A close, releasing ssDNA. The domains also move apart, causing the ssDNA to be pulled along the DNA binding channel relative to domain 2A. Thus the DNA is effectively moved along the channel and translocation occurs. However, this “classical inchworm” method of translocation is reliant on one of the two RecA-like domains of the helicase region alternating between strong and weak DNA binding in the ATP-bound and ATP-free conformations, with the other domain conversely alternating between weak and strong DNA binding.In this study, we have investigated the RecG helicase of Escherichia coli. RecG was first identified as a protein involved in DNA recombination and repair (17.Lloyd R.G. Buckman C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This role was supported by the discovery that it has specificity for branched DNA molecules, in particular, Holliday junctions and replication forks (18.Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19.McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol.

It does not unwind linear duplex DNA and has extremely low activity on classical linear, partial duplexes. Biochemical studies revealed that RecG is active as a monomer (22.McGlynn P. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2324-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and catalyzes the interconversion of forks and junctions (20.McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G.

Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 413-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26.McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The conversion of a replication fork into a Holliday junction requires the simultaneous unwinding of the leading and lagging strands followed by the reannealing of the two parental strands and the annealing of the two nascent strands. An understanding of how this could be achieved has come from the crystal structure of Thermatoga maritima RecG in complex with a replication fork substrate (27.Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). RecG has standard helicase domains linked to a novel “wedge” domain that provides the specificity for branched DNA. The structure has suggested models for how RecG could translocate on double-stranded DNA (27.Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 28.Mahdi A.A. McGlynn P. Levett S.D. Lloyd R.G.

Sci. 2004; 359: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The monomeric nature of the active RecG helicase precludes the use of a physical barrier to prevent dissociation, as employed by the hexameric helicases. In addition, it also excludes the use of a rolling method of translocation to maintain contact with the DNA. We have found no evidence of an interaction with a sliding clamp complex. The poor binding observed with non-branched DNA molecules provides evidence against a classical inchworm method, which necessitates having a strong binding site within the conserved helicase region of the protein. We have dissected the RecG domain structure and identified the main structural features facilitating DNA binding. From the results presented, we suggest the wedge domain not only provides the specificity for branched DNA structures and the means to separate DNA strands but also prevents dissociation of RecG from branched DNA during the translocation process. In this sense, the wedge can be regarded as both a strand separation module and a processivity factor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Plasmids—The E. coli strains used are all derivatives of MG1655 (30.Bachmann B.J. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

C.1996: 2460-2488Google Scholar), except AM1125, a ΔrecG263 derivative of BL21(DE3) plysS (31.Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). N4256 (ΔrecG263::kan), N4583 (ΔruvABC::cat), and N4971 (ΔrecG263 ΔruvABC) have been described (32.Bolt E.L. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The pT7-7-derived plasmid, pAM210, carries a cassette version of wild-type recG, allowing convenient restriction fragment exchange (28.Mahdi A.A. McGlynn P. Levett S.D. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3875-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutant recG genes encoding RecG proteins with defined amino acid substitutions were made by site directed mutagenesis using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) as described (31.Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mutations were transferred into pAM210 by fragment exchange, confirmed by DNA sequencing, and subsequently engineered into the E. coli chromosome essentially as described (33.Posfai G. Koob M.D. Kirkpatrick H.A. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4426-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The mutated chromosomal recG allele was then transferred into AM1418, a ΔrecG263::kan ΔpyrE::dhfr derivative of MG1655 2A. A. Mahdi, unpublished observations. by P1vir-mediated transduction, selecting for Pyr+ colonies. Inheritance of the donor recG allele was indicated by loss of the kanamycin resistance of the recipient ΔrecG263::kan and confirmed by sequencing PCR products amplified using recG-specific primers. The ΔruvABC::cat allele was subsequently introduced by P1vir-mediated transduction from strain N4971, selecting resistance to chloramphenicol. To make a construct encoding a Δwedge derivative of RecG, the DNA encoding the N-terminal region of RecG from Met-1 to Thr-48 was amplified from pAM210 using a 5′ primer covering the NdeI site and a 3′ primer inserting a SpeI site, which modified the Thr-48 codon ACC for ACT (silent mutation) and added a codon for Ser-49. This was cloned into pBluescript SK(+) as an NdeI-SpeI fragment to form pGB005. A further region of RecG, from Glu146 to Arg223, was amplified from pAM210 using primers that added a 5′ SpeI site and encompassed the 3′ SalI site. This was inserted into pGB005 as a SpeI-SalI fragment to form pGB008. The entire NdeI-SalI fragment was then transferred into pAM210 by fragment exchange to form the plasmid pGB010. A construct encoding the wedge domain of RecG was amplified from pAM210, using primers that modified Leu42 to Met by the addition of an NdeI site and a 3′ stop codon, TAA, by the addition of a 3′ HindIII site. This was cloned into pET28 as NdeI-HindIII fragment to form the plasmid pGB023.Media and General Methods—LB broth and agar media and methods for P1 transduction and for determining sensitivity to UV light were as described (34.Al-Deib A.A. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6782-6789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data for UV survival are based on the means of at least two, but in most cases three or more, independent experiments. Values are very reproducible, with standard errors being less than 10% of the mean.Protein Expression and Purification—Full-length wild-type RecG mutants, carrying defined amino acid substitutions, and the Δwedge derivative were purified as described (31.Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The RecG wedge domain linked to a His6 tag at the N terminus was expressed as described (31.Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Induced cells were resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl) containing 10 mm imidazole and lysed by sonication, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. This was loaded onto a Ni2+-charged Hitrap chelating column and eluted with a gradient of Buffer A containing 0.01–1 m imidazole. After buffer exchange into Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) using a PD-10 column, the protein was loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column and eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Peak fractions of the wedge protein was dialyzed against Buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl and 50% glycerol and stored at -80 °C.DNA Substrates—DNA substrates J12 and RF were made by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides as described (18.Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21.McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Holliday junction, J12, has a homologous core of 12 bp flanked by 19–20-bp heterologous arms. The partial replication fork (RF) has a 25-bp duplex lagging strand arm (31.Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All DNA concentrations are given in moles of junction or fork structure.DNA Binding and Unwinding—Assays were conducted essentially as described (21.McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31.Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For binding assays, RecG and 32P-labeled substrate DNA were mixed in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6% (v/v) glycerol) and incubated on ice for 15 min before loading onto a prechilled 4% native polyacrylamide gel in a low ionic strength buffer (6.7 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, and 2 mm EDTA). Electrophoresis was at 160 V for 90 min at 4 °C. For DNA unwinding assays, RecG at the concentration indicated was mixed in helicase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ATP, and 5 mm MgCl2) and kept on ice for 5 min prior to the addition of labeled substrate DNA to 0.2 nm. An aliquot was removed immediately and deproteinized by the addition of 0.2 volumes of stop buffer (2.5% (w/v) SDS, 200 mm EDTA, and 10 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubating for a further 10 min at 37 °C. This was taken as the zero time point. The remaining reaction was then placed at 37 °C, and samples were removed at intervals, and deproteinized. All samples were then analyzed by electrophoresis using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and a Tris borate buffer system. For both DNA binding and unwinding assays, gels were dried and quantified using x-ray film and a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics).RESULTSRecG-DNA Interactions at the DNA Branch Point—The crystal structure of RecG from T. maritima identified two residues as candidates in the binding of branched DNA molecules. Phe204 was thought to stabilize the orphan base of the leading strand template by base stacking, effectively capping the parental duplex. Tyr208 was thought to play a similar role in the stabilization of the lagging strand duplex (27.Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment of this region of RecG (Fig. 1A) shows that Phe204 in T. maritima is highly conserved and is likely to be equivalent to Phe97 in E. coli. However, Tyr208 is less conserved, and there is no equivalent aromatic residue in E. coli RecG at position 101. However, those sequences that do not have an aromatic residue at position 101 (E. coli numbering) do have an aromatic residue at position 99. Based on the published T. maritima RecG-DNA structure, we modeled the E. coli RecG in a complex with a DNA structure mimicking a replication fork but without a leading strand at the branch point (Fig. 1, B and C). Analysis of this model suggests that the E. coli residue Phe96 may also have a stabilizing effect equivalent to that of Phe204 in T. maritima, whereas Phe99 could act as an equivalent of Tyr208. In addition, Phe75 may be in position to stabilize the separation of the leading strand duplex, and Arg78 may be in position to interact with the phosphate backbone of the leading strand template. To test these hypotheses, we mutated phenylalanine residues 75, 96, 97, and 99 to alanine and Arg8 to glutamine and studied the resulting proteins in vivo and in vitro.A ΔrecG allele confers extreme sensitivity to UV radiation when combined with ΔruvABC allele but only very modest sensitivity in a ruv+ background (Fig. 2A), consistent with the overlapping roles of the RecG and RuvABC proteins in the processing of DNA repair intermediates (26.McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 36.Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used this difference to investigate the activities of the mutant RecG proteins in vivo, replacing the chromosomal wild-type recG with a mutated copy. We used chromosomal constructs because previous studies have shown that the increased expression of RecG from a high copy number recG+ plasmid construct reduces the copy number of that plasmid quite severely. This effect is reversed to varying degrees by mutations that reduce or eliminate RecG activity (31.Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37.Vincent S.D. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Such effects can complicate the in vivo analysis of RecG mutant proteins expressed from a plasmid, especially as RecG appears to be expressed normally at very low levels in the cell (less than 10 copies/cell during exponential growth. 3P.

The single mutants also proved resistant to the DNA cross-linking agent, mitomycin C, unlike recG null strains, which are quite sensitive (17.Lloyd R.G. Buckman C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate the substitutions cause little or no reduction in the capacity of RecG to promote DNA repair. The F96A and F97A mutations also have little effect on their own but reduce UV survival substantially when combined with ΔruvABC (Fig. 2C). Thus, whereas these substitutions impair repair activity, the effect is hardly noticeable in the presence of RuvABC.As the sequence alignments and model structure indicate that the loss of Phe96 could be alleviated by Phe97 and, vice versa, the loss of Phe97 by Phe96, we made the double mutant. This mutation proved as extreme as ΔrecG, with or without RuvABC (Fig. 2C), indicating that it eliminates RecG activity, consistent with Phe96 and Phe97 being to a large degree functionally interchangeable. The reduced survival seen with the double mutant in the presence of RuvABC is modest but is highly reproducible and similar in extent to that seen with ΔrecG. It is also associated with a comparable increase in sensitivity to mitomycin C (data not shown). Transcription of the mutant gene from its chromosomal locus might be expected to occur with normal efficiency, but it is possible that the two substitutions interfere with protein solubility and stability. Two observations argue against this possibility. First, the mutant protein was expressed at a high level from a pT7-7 plasmid construct and proved both soluble and stable. Second, when the plasmid construct was introduced into the strains used for measuring sensitivity to UV light, the mutant protein could be detected in the soluble fraction by Western analysis. The same was true for all the other RecG proteins analyzed (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the double mutant protein is expressed normally but is defective in DNA repair.Our modeled structure of the E. coli RecG-DNA complex implicates Phe96 and Phe97 in the stabilization of the leading strand template. To determine whether the substitutions at these positions reduce the DNA binding and unwinding activities, the mutant proteins were purified and tested on replication fork and Holliday junction structures. The single mutants have an ∼20-fold reduction in the ability to bind the partial (missing the leading strand) RF substrate, and the double mutant has an ∼50-fold reduction (Fig. 3A). Reduced binding is also seen with a Holliday junction substrate, J12 (Fig. 3, B and C). However, in this case there is a significant difference between the mutants; Phe96 has a 50-fold reduction in binding, but Phe97 has only a 4-fold reduction. The double mutant has a 500-fold reduction in affinity.Fig. 3DNA binding properties of RecG proteins. A, RF binding affinities as measured in band shift assays with 0.2 nm32P-labeled DNA. B, band shift assay with Holliday junction substrate J12. Reactions used the RecG proteins indicated at 0, 0.025, 0.1, 0.4, 1.6, 6.25, 25, or 100 nm and 32P-labeled J12 DNA at 0.2 nm. C, quantification of J12 binding. Data are the means of at least two experiments as described in B. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The rates of unwinding of the RF substrate reflect the differences in the binding affinities. All three proteins have detectable activity when used at 10 nm, but when used at 0.5 nm it is clear that both F96A and F97A have only 3–5% of the wild-type RecG activity, whereas unwinding by the double mutant is too low to be accurately measured (Fig. 4A). The F97A protein has a much greater ability to unwind the Holliday junction substrate at 0.5 nm, having ∼20% of wild-type activity as opposed to 5% for F96A. It appears that a mutation at Phe97 has less effect on both binding and unwinding activity with the Holliday junction substrate than with the RF substrate, whereas substrate type appears to have little effect on F96A activity. This implies their activities are not functionally identical. These data suggest that the mutant proteins would be less effective than the wild-type protein in targeting branched DNA structures in vivo, thus accounting for the observed deficiency in DNA repair.Fig. 4Unwinding activity of RecG proteins. A and B, rates of dissociation of 32P-labeled RF (A) and Holliday junction (J12) (B) substrates at an initial concentration of 0.2 nm with either 10 nm (left) or 0.5 nm (right) RecG proteins as indicated.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Deletion of the RecG Wedge Domain—Our studies on the phenylalanine mutations F96A and F97A imply that the binding of branched DNA is almost entirely due to interactions with the wedge domain. Analysis of the crystal structure of RecG from T. maritima and our model of RecG from E. coli indicated it might be possible to delete the entire wedge domain while retaining a correctly folded protein with an unaffected DNA duplex translocation channel. We constructed such a deletion version of RecG (Δwedge) by replacing residues 49–145 with a single serine residue (Fig. 5). A plasmid construct designed to express the mutant protein failed to confer resistance to UV light and mitomycin C in a ΔrecG strain and also failed to eliminate the extreme UV sensitivity conferred by ΔrecG in a Δruv background (data not shown), indicating that deletion of the wedge disables the ability of RecG to promote DNA repair. After over-expression in an E. coli strain deleted for native RecG, the Δwedge protein was found to purify under conditions identical to the full-length protein and was stable under normal assay conditions. As might be predicted from the structure of a RecG-DNA complex and the failure of the mutant protein to function in vivo, band shift assays showed that the Δwedge protein has a drastically reduced affinity for both the J12 and RF substrates (Fig. 6A and data not shown). The binding of J12 appears to be ∼10,000-fold weaker than with wild-type RecG (Fig. 6B). Unwinding activity is barely detectable at protein concentrations normally used for wild-type RecG (1–10 nm), even though significant unwinding activity is seen with the phenylalanine mutants under these conditions (Fig. 4). Unwinding activity is detectable at high pro"

https://openalex.org/W2163312629,"We present a comprehensive description of the dynamic behavior of CDK2 in complex with cyclin A, arrived at by analysis of a total of 0.25 μs of solvated molecular dynamics trajectories and 42 deposited CDK2 structures, and refined using other protein simulation algorithms. The CDK2-cyclin A dimer is a dynamic complex of 6 subdomains. Thermal motions are dominated by a relative twisting of the two monomers. The predominant motion within CDK2 is a breathing of the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes. The N-terminal lobe of cyclin A is tightly linked to the PSTAIRE helix of CDK2 to provide a rigid nucleus to the complex. By contrast, the CDK-insert region (residues 219-251) sometimes becomes highly mobile, a behavior that is observed in crystallographic analyses of CDK2 structures and that may relate to its role in recognizing diverse binding partners. We find that the three arginines that anchor phosphothreonine 160 of fully active CDK2 do not contribute equally to structural stabilization. This observation is supported by a survey of protein kinase sequences. We have also explored the physical basis of the role of the phosphate moiety in signaling by artificially modifying the charge of phosphothreonine 160 in molecular dynamics simulations. We find that phosphothreonine binding involves an active process of attraction in which both the receptor site (the arginine triad), and the phosphothreonine have a higher charge than is required to maintain an active conformation once formed. We have deposited our dynamics data to aid protein kinase inhibitor design."
https://openalex.org/W2061801537,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of tuberculosis, is a devastating human pathogen. The emergence of multidrug resistance in recent years has prompted a search for new drug targets and for a better understanding of mechanisms of resistance. Here we focus on the gene product of an open reading frame from M. tuberculosis, Rv1347c, which is annotated as a putative aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferase. The Rv1347c protein does not show this activity, however, and we show from its crystal structure, coupled with functional and bioinformatic data, that its most likely role is in the biosynthesis of mycobactin, the M. tuberculosis siderophore. The crystal structure of Rv1347c was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing from selenomethionine-substituted protein and refined at 2.2 Å resolution (r = 0.227, Rfree = 0.257). The protein is monomeric, with a fold that places it in the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family of acyltransferases. Features of the structure are an acyl-CoA binding site that is shared with other GNAT family members and an adjacent hydrophobic channel leading to the surface that could accommodate long-chain acyl groups. Modeling the postulated substrate, the Nϵ-hydroxylysine side chain of mycobactin, into the acceptor substrate binding groove identifies two residues at the active site, His130 and Asp168, that have putative roles in substrate binding and catalysis.

The Rv1347c protein does not show this activity, however, and we show from its crystal structure, coupled with functional and bioinformatic data, that its most likely role is in the biosynthesis of mycobactin, the M. tuberculosis siderophore. The crystal structure of Rv1347c was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing from selenomethionine-substituted protein and refined at 2.2 Å resolution (r = 0.227, Rfree = 0.257). The protein is monomeric, with a fold that places it in the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family of acyltransferases. Features of the structure are an acyl-CoA binding site that is shared with other GNAT family members and an adjacent hydrophobic channel leading to the surface that could accommodate long-chain acyl groups. Modeling the postulated substrate, the Nϵ-hydroxylysine side chain of mycobactin, into the acceptor substrate binding groove identifies two residues at the active site, His130 and Asp168, that have putative roles in substrate binding and catalysis.

Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione M.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). Two features of this very slow growing organism make it particularly difficult to combat. First, it has a thick, waxy cell wall, rich in unusual lipids (2.Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar), that makes it impermeable to many drugs. Second, when engulfed by macrophages, it can switch its metabolism and remain in a latent or persistent state inside granulomas in the lung (3.Parrish N.M. Dick J.D. Bishai W.R. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 4.McKinney J.D. Honer zu Bentrup K. Munoz-Elias E.J. Miczak A. Chen B. Chan W.T. Swenson D. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Russell D.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). This latent state can last for many years (5.O'Regan A. Joyce-Brady M. Br. Med. J. 2001; 323: 635Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), until the organism is reactivated, for example when the immune system becomes compromised. Current estimates are that one-third of the world's population is infected, and that the incidence of active TB is rising, in particular as a result of synergy with the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Although effective anti-TB drugs exist, treatment regimes require a mixture of two to three drugs administered for at least 6 months. The emergence in recent years of strains of M. tuberculosis that are resistant to all of the current front-line drugs (6.Stokstad E. Science. 2000; 287: 2391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) presents a new threat, paralleling the rise in resistance to antibiotics across the whole spectrum of infectious disease (7.Barker K.F. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1999; 48: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The publication of the complete genome sequence for the H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis (8.Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T.

Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar) presents new opportunities, both for understanding, at a molecular level, the factors that contribute to antibiotic resistance and for identifying genes whose protein products have potential importance as targets for the design of new anti-TB drugs. At the same time, the problems of functional annotation are considerable; a large proportion of the gene products of the M. tuberculosis genome are still of unknown or uncertain function, some anticipated pathways cannot be traced in their entirety, and many presently unknown pathways are likely to exist. Several open reading frames (ORFs) in the M. tuberculosis genome have been annotated as antibiotic resistance genes. These include two putative aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferases (APHs) (Rv3225c and Rv3817) and three putative aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases (AACs) (Rv0133, Rv0262c, and Rv1347c). The aminoglycosides, which include streptomycin, the first chemotherapeutic agent to be effective against M. tuberculosis, typically have a three-ring structure comprising one highly substituted aminocyclitol ring linked to a modified ribose, which is in turn linked to N-acetylglucosamine. The APH enzymes inactivate aminoglycoside antibiotics by ATP-dependent phosphorylation of a target oxygen atom and the AAC enzymes by CoA-dependent acetylation of an amino group (9.Smith C.A. Baker E.N. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2002; 2: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A confounding factor in the annotation of these ORFs, however, is that both the APHs and the AACs belong to wider families of enzymes with diverse functions. The APHs are structurally homologous with protein kinases (10.Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S.C. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and possess weak protein kinase activity (11.Daigle D.M. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1998; 6: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The AACs belong to a large family of N-acetyltransferases that includes enzymes that acetylate histones and other amino-containing substrates, as well as aminoglycosides (12.Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13.Dyda F. Klein D.C. Hickman A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 81-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Sequence identity within these families is generally low, making definitive identification difficult, and substrate specificity can be relatively broad. Thus, for example, the gene product of Rv0262c has been shown to be able to carry out the in vitro acetylation of aminoglycosides with either 2′-amino or 2′-hydroxyl substituents, but biochemical data and inferences from the crystal structure suggest that the “true” physiological substrate could be a substituted glucosamine derivative such as mycothiol (14.Hegde S.S. Javid-Majd F. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45876-45881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15.Vetting M.W. Hegde S.S. Javid-Majd F. Blanchard J.S. Roderick S.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the product of the M. tuberculosis ORF Rv1347c, determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.2 Å resolution. This gene product has been annotated as a possible aminoglycoside 6′-N-acetyltransferase, although recent in vitro biochemical assays have failed to demonstrate this activity (16.Draker K.A. Boehr D.D. Elowe N.H. Noga T.J. Wright G.D. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2003; 56: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Intriguingly Rv1347c has been found to be essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in a genomescale transposon mutagenesis analysis (17.Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar), suggesting that it could have some other, essential, function. The structure determined here shows that Rv1347c is a member of the GCN5 related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family of enzymes (13.Dyda F. Klein D.C. Hickman A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 81-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), which includes the AACs (18.Wolf E. Vassilev A. Makino Y. Sali A. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the structure, however, combined with bioinformatic analysis and modeling, leads us to suggest an alternative role in siderophore biosynthesis. We propose that Rv1347c functions in the acylation of one or both of the Nϵ-hydroxylysine arms of mycobactin, the essential iron chelator produced by M. tuberculosis, and further identify several key residues at the active site and a hydrophobic channel that can accommodate a long-chain acyl group. Overexpression and Purification—The gene coding for Rv1347c was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA, and cloned into a modified pET42a vector (Novagen), with an rTEV cleavage site incorporated. Rv1347c was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) as a C-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. To increase the yield of soluble fusion protein, each 1-liter culture was grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.7 was reached, at which point the temperature was reduced to 25 °C. The temperature was further reduced to 18 °C once an A600 of 1.2 was attained, after which expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 1.5. Expression was allowed to continue overnight. Cells were harvested at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and resuspended in precooled lysis buffer; 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, containing 10 mm benzamidine and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The fusion protein was extracted from the cells using ultrasonication and batch-purified on pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Following three washes in cold lysis buffer (minus benzamidine and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the resin was resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer and EDTA added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The resin was then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 0.2 mg of rTEV (Invitrogen), leaving Rv1347c in the soluble fraction. The resin was removed using a 0.2-μm filter and the Rv1347c separated from the poly-His-tagged rTEV by passing over a HiTrap chelating ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel and pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. Soluble Rv1347c was present in the flow-through fraction. The flow-through fraction was concentrated using an Amicon stirred cell (membrane cut-off 10 kDa) and loaded onto a Superdex 75 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated in running buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% NaN3. Rv1347c was isolated in an elution volume consistent with a molecular mass of ∼24 kDa. Dynamic light scattering (DynaPro, Protein Solutions) showed a monodisperse sample with a ratio Cp/RH of 18.2% and a molecular mass of 28 kDa, consistent with a monomeric species in solution. The protein was concentrated to ∼15 mg ml−1 and stored frozen in small aliquots at -80 °C. Selenomethionine-incorporated (SeMet) protein was produced via inhibition of the methionine metabolism pathway (19.Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) and purified as above. After concentration to ∼15 mg ml−1, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (adjusted to pH 8.0) was added to a final concentration of 2 mm to help prevent oxidation of the SeMet. Incorporation of SeMet was assayed using ion spray mass spectrometry, which confirmed the incorporation of five SeMet residues. Crystallization and Data Collection—Initial crystallization conditions were identified by the Crystallization Facility of the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Structural Genomics Consortium (www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/TB/) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory using CRYSTOOL random screening (20.Segelke B.W. J. Cryst. Growth. 2001; 232: 553-562Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and were readily reproducible in our laboratory. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion from hanging drops by mixing equal volumes of the native or SeMet incorporated protein with crystallization buffer; 25–27% methoxypolyethylene glycol 5000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 0.8% β-octyl glucoside (BOG). The crystals belong to space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 75.85 Å, b = 77.39 Å, c = 297.60 Å, with eight molecules per asymmetric unit giving a Matthews coefficient VM of 2.4 Å3/Da (51% solvent). For data collection, the crystals were flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at 100 K after stepwise addition of polyethylene glycol 400 to the crystal drops to a final concentration of 5%. A native data set to 2.15 Å resolution was collected in-house, using Cu-Kα radiation from a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode generator equipped with Osmic mirror optics and a Mar345 image plate detector. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data to 2.25 Å resolution were collected at three wavelengths using a Quantum 4 ADSC CCD detector on Beamline 9-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. All data were reduced and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (21.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar).

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), which located 30 of the expected 32 sites (excluding the N-terminal Met residues, which are disordered in all eight molecules). The initial phases, which gave a figure of merit of 0.66 for data to 2.5 Å resolution, were improved using solvent flattening and 8-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging as in RESOLVE (23.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The final figure of merit was 0.72. Initial tracing of the polypeptide chain was performed using MAID (24.Levitt D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1013-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the side chains were placed manually using the program O (25.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out using CNS (26.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallgr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar) incorporating Rfree validation to monitor the progress of refinement. The final model contained 1,590 residues out of the 1,680 expected in the asymmetric unit, together with 650 water molecules and three BOG molecules, which were found in equivalent positions in three of the eight molecules (D, E, and G) in the asymmetric unit. The final R and Rfree values are 0.227 and 0.257, respectively, with a root mean square deviation from standard geometry of 0.009 Å for bond lengths and 1.7° for angles. The residues that are modeled in the eight molecules of the asymmetric unit are: A, 10–207; B, 12–207; C, 11–209; D, 10–209; E, 10–207; F, 8–209; G, 11–210; H, 10–206. The main chain torsion angles conform well with standard values, with 89% of non-glycine residues falling in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, as defined in PROCHECK (27.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and only two residues (0.1% of total) in disallowed regions. Crystal Structure Determination—The ORF Rv1347c, which encodes a poplypeptide of 210 amino acid residues, was cloned into E. coli, overexpressed, purified, and crystallized. The crystal structure was then solved, in its apo form, by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction methods (28.Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) using selenomethionine-substituted protein and was refined at 2.2 Å resolution to a final R factor of 0.227 (Rfree = 0.257) (Table II). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains eight independent molecules. To investigate possible oligomerization we analyzed the interfaces between neighboring molecules using the Protein-Protein Interaction Server (www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server), based on principles described by Jones and Thornton (29.Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that the largest interface buries only 477 Å2 (4.5%) of the total accessible surface of the molecule, typical for intermolecular crystal contacts, strongly suggesting that the protein is monomeric in solution. This is consistent with gel filtration and dynamic light scattering data (data not shown), which also indicate a monmeric species.Table IIRefinement statisticsResolution range (Å)40.0–2.2Number of reflections (working/test)83,972/1,824R factor/Rfree0.227/0.257Number of atoms (non-hydrogen) Protein (eight molecules)12,812 Solvent650 β-Octyl glucoside (3 mol)60Root mean square deviations from ideality Bonds (Å)0.006 Angles (degree)1.33Average B factors (Å2) Protein atoms36.0 Water molecules33.1 β-Octyl glucoside58.8Residues in most favored region (%)89.2 Open table in a new tab Molecular Structure—The Rv1347c monomer is folded into a single domain based on a central β-sheet with helices packed against both faces of the sheet (Fig. 1). The most striking feature of the structure, which is characteristic of all acyltransferases of the GNAT family (see below), is that the β-sheet is divided into two halves which diverge in the center to create a cleft that serves as a conserved binding site for the acyl-CoA cofactor (13.Dyda F. Klein D.C. Hickman A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 81-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The N-terminal four strands, β1–β4, form an antiparallel β-sheet that abuts a C-terminal three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet comprising strands β5–β7. Strands β4 and β5 run parallel, joined by hydrogen bonding at their N-terminal ends but diverging half-way along. In other GNAT family members, this divergence has been attributed to the presence of a conserved β-bulge in strand β4 that gives an accentuated twist to this strand. Rv1347c does not have this bulge, however, yet β4 from Rv1347c aligns perfectly with the β4 strands of the other family members apart from the deletion of one residue from the middle of the strand. This suggests that the β-bulge may have more to do with the details of substrate binding and catalysis than the polypeptide conformation of the GNAT scaffold. The single residue, His130, that replaces the two β-bulge residues of the other proteins is invariant in all the closest homologs of Rv1347c and seems likely to have a key active site role (see below). One face of the central β-sheet has three helices packed against it, α1, α2, and α3, following the nomenclature of Modis and Wierenga (30.Modis Y. Wierenga R. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1345-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These three helices form the connection between strands β1 and β2, and together with the 16-residue β3-β4 loop (residues 110–125), the short β6-β7 loop, and part of a long N-terminal extension, enclose a cavity above the central β-sheet that we propose to be the acceptor substrate binding site. The other face of the β-sheet has packed against it two helices, the long α4 helix connecting strands β4 and β5, which is a conserved feature of all GCN5 family enzymes, and the shorter α5 helix joining strands β5 and β6. Prior to strand β1, the N-terminal portion of the polypeptide wraps around the periphery of the molecule, largely in extended form except for a short 310-helix, and contributes a loop, residues 16–20, that helps enclose the proposed binding site for the acceptor substrate. The overall topology resembles a left-handed glove, with the N-terminal half of the β-sheet and helices α1-α3 representing the palm and fingers of the hand and the C-terminal half of the β-sheet representing the thumb. The cleft formed between the “thumb” and the “palm” is the putative binding site for AcCoA and adjacent to this, in the hollow of the palm is the proposed substrate binding site. The crystal structure contains several additional pieces of continuous density that cannot be accounted for by the polypeptide chain (Fig. 2). The most prominent of these is an extended ribbon of density that is found associated with each of the eight molecules in the asymmetric unit. Although not equally well defined in each case, it can be modeled as a molecule of the detergent BOG, which was used in crystallization, and has been fully refined as such in three of the eight molecules. The extended octyl chain inserts into a hydrophobic cleft in the “back” side of the molecule, in contact with residues Gly96, Trp98, Leu106, Ile133, Phe143, Leu147, and Ile151 from strands β2, β3, and β4, and helix α4. The glucosyl ring resides on the surface between the β2-β3 and β4-α4 loops, in contact with Trp98, Thr101, Asp135, and Lys138. A second, but less well defined, ribbon of density follows another hydrophobic channel leading to the acyl-CoA binding site (discussed later). Sequence and Structural Comparisons—Searches of the current sequence data bases with BLAST (31.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar) reveals many homologous sequences, reflecting the widespread occurrence of proteins from the GNAT family. The top BLAST hits, which are almost exclusively from bacteria, apart from a few fungal representatives, include many proteins that are annotated as “conserved hypotheticals.” Perhaps significantly, however, more than half of the top 30 hits are to various bacterial homologues of IucB, which is a CoA-dependent Nϵ-hydroxylysine N-acetyltransferase from the biosynthetic pathway for the siderophore aerobactin (32.De Lorenzo V. Bindereif A. Paw B.H. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 570-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence identity between Rv1347c and these proteins is ∼25% on a pairwise basis, with only nine residues completely conserved (Fig. 3). Four of these conserved residues, Asp126, Gly128, His130, and Pro169 in Rv1347c, together with Asp168, which changes only to Glu, map to strands β4 and β5, around the region of the proposed active site.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar; see also www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm/) aligns Rv1347c with a number of other GNAT family enzymes. The closest structural homologues are two aminoglycoside 6′-N-acetyltransferases, from Salmonella enteritidis (AAC6′-Iy) (34.Vetting M.W. Magnet S. Nieves E. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Chem.

Each of these proteins matches Rv1347c to a similar degree, with typically 130–140 Cα atoms aligning with root mean square differences of 2.6–3.0 Å and sequence identities over the aligned portions of 10–15%. The most closely matching portion comprises strands β2-β6 of the central β-sheet, together with helices α4 and α5. Cofactor Binding—All structurally characterized acyltransferases of the GNAT family share the same binding site for the acyl-CoA cofactor, in which the pantotheine moiety is wedged between the diverging β-strands β4 and β5, with the thioacyl group close to the point of divergence. Binding depends on three main features; hydrogen bonding of the pantotheine amide groups with main chain groups on strand β4, a hydrophobic pocket for the dimethyl moiety, and interactions of the diphosphate moiety with main chain NH groups from the β4-α4 connection and the N terminus of helix α4. The latter interaction accounts for one of the most conserved sequence motifs in GNAT enzymes, designated motif A (12.Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The preponderance of main chain interactions accounts for the remarkably consistent CoA conformation found in GNAT enzymes (13.Dyda F. Klein D.C. Hickman A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 81-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), despite low sequence identity. Attempts to co-crystallize Rv1347c with acetyl-CoA have not been successful, but the pantotheine moiety can be modeled into the Rv1347c structure in a straightforward way, as in Fig. 2, based on the other GNAT family members. The two pantotheine amide groups hydrogen bond to peptide C=O and NH groups from strand β4; these correspond in Rv1347c to 131 C=O and 133 NH. The side chain of Asn173 could also provide an additional hydrogen bond, either directly (after a small conformational adjustment) or via a bridging water; this is not a conserved interaction in GNAT enzymes but is found in all cases where an Asn residue fills this position. As expected, the dimethyl group is adjacent to several hydrophobic side chains, from Ile133 and Val139. It is not p"

At a lower concentration of 0.2 μm, PDI facilitated the aggregation of unfolded rabbit muscle creatine kinase (CK) and exhibited anti-chaperone activity, which was shown to be mainly due to the hydrophobic interactions between PDI and CK and was independent of the cross-linking of disulfide bonds. At concentrations above 1 μm, PDI acted as a protector against aggregation but an inhibitor of reactivation during CK refolding. The inhibition effect of PDI on CK reactivation was further characterized as due to the formation of PDI-CK complexes through intermolecular disulfide bonds, a process involving Cys-36 and Cys-295 of PDI. Two disulfide-linked complexes containing both PDI and CK were obtained, and the large, soluble aggregates around 400 kDa were composed of 1 molecule of tetrameric PDI and 2 molecules of inactive intermediate dimeric CK, whereas the smaller one, around 200 kDa, was formed by 1 dimeric PDI and 1 dimeric CK. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that PDI could switch its conformation from dimer to tetramer in its functions as a foldase.

In eukaryotes, all the nascent outer membrane and secreted proteins are synthesized and fold to their native structures in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum. The specialized compartment provides a favorable environment for native disulfide bond formation, which is often the rate-limiting step in the folding of many proteins. Endoplasmic reticulum is abundant in molecular chaperones and folding catalysts, among which the most abundant and efficient catalyst of disulfide bond formation is protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; CK, rabbit muscle creatine kinase; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type.

PDI is a multidomain and multifunction homodimer. It comprises four thioredoxin-like domains, a, b, b′, and a′, plus a linker region between b′ and a′ and a C-terminal acid extension (2.Freedman R.B.

Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that the b′ domain provides the principle peptide binding site, whereas the other domains should also be involved when the protein substrates have a substantial secondary structure (7.Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8.Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The latest study (9.Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of a ligand binding site in the b′ domain, which was a small hydrophobic pocket defined as Leu-242, Leu-244, Phe-258, and Ile-272. Much effort has been devoted to investigating the catalytic mechanism of PDI since the first report published more than 40 years ago (10.Goldberger R.F. Epstein C.J. Anfisen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 628-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As an enzyme, the specific binding to its substrate is a basic property of PDI, and the nature of the interaction between PDI and its substrates plays a crucial role in its activity of accelerating steps in protein folding associated with disulfide formation or isomerization. However, the lack of high resolution structures of PDI or the PDI-substrate complex limits the knowledge of the pathway involved, and thus, the identification of the PDI-substrate complex is the key to elucidating its catalytic mechanism. Unfortunately, only a few reports have addressed this problem directly. Direct evidence of the binding ability of PDI was found in the characterization of a complex (>500 kDa) of PDI and alcohol dehydrogenase by gel filtration HPLC analysis (11.Primm T.D. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By chemical cross-linking of peptides or nonnative proteins to PDI, Klappa et al. (8.Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 12.Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) recently proposed that the essential core of the PDI binding site was in its b′ domain, and all four domains might contribute to the binding of large peptides. It, thus, seems likely that PDI provides a specific environment that facilitates large peptide folding through all domains. However, it is not clear yet whether this hypothesis is true or not for large proteins, and it is still unknown how PDI further performs its activity through the cross-linking of disulfide bonds. Particularly, it is still a mystery how PDI acts for very large proteins that might have similar or larger dimensions than PDI. In this study creatine kinase (CK, EC 2.7.3.2), an 86-kDa model protein extensively studied in our laboratory (13.Ou W.B. Luo W. Park Y.D. Zhou H.M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2346-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14.Li S. Bai J.H. Park Y.D. Zhou H.M. Int. J. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was chosen as the protein substrate of PDI. CK is a homodimer with large quantities of secondary structures, and each subunit of CK contains four free cysteines. Because the refolding of CK did not need the oxidation of any free sulfhydryls into disulfides, no thiol-disulfide interchange reactions would occur upon the formation of the PDI-CK complexes, and thus, an accumulation of the long-lived PDI-substrate complexes was obtained. These complexes were characterized as being disulfide-linked by comparing the PDI activity of assisting CK refolding in solutions with or without DTT. The mutation analysis further indicated that although the noncovalent hydrophobic interactions were the major driving force, Cys-36 and Cys-295 of PDI were involved in PDI-CK interactions. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first report that PDI could switch its conformation from dimer to tetramer in its catalysis of CK refolding, which implied that a much more complex mechanism associated with dimer to tetramer transition of PDI might play a crucial role in its assisting large proteins to refold. Materials—The plasmid pBV220-PDI (5.20 kilobases) containing the human PDI gene without the signal peptide was a generous gift from Dr. Y. Gao, Capital Normal University, People's Republic of China. Ultrapure GdnHCl, Tris, and ATP were from Sigma. DTT was from Promega. Mouse anti-PDI monoclonal antibody was purchased from MBL International Corp, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse antibody was from DAKO. N-Ethylmaleimide was from Acros Organics. All the other chemicals were local products of analytical grade. Protein Purification and Concentration Determinations—PDI was purified according to the published protocol (16.Gao Y. Yang Z.W. Hua Z.L. Gao H. Wan P. Li H.Y. J. Biol. Eng. 1999; 15: 349-354Google Scholar). The preparation of rabbit muscle CK was as described earlier (17.Yao Q.Z. Zhou H.M. Hou L.X. Tsou C.L. Sci. Sin. 1982; 25: 1296-1302Google Scholar). Purified PDI and CK were homogeneous on SDS-PAGE. The concentrations of PDI and CK were measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, A0.1%1cm = 0.9 for PDI (18.Hu C.H. Wang C.C. Chin. Biochem. J. 1988; 4: 61-66Google Scholar) and A0.1%1cm = 0.88 for CK (17.Yao Q.Z. Zhou H.M. Hou L.X. Tsou C.L. Sci. Sin. 1982; 25: 1296-1302Google Scholar). Construction of PDI Mutants—There are six cysteine residues in the primary sequence of PDI, two located at the N-terminal active site (a domain), two at the C-terminal active site (a′ domain), and two in the b′ domain. According to the requirement of the experiment, some of the cysteines are mutated to serines to give rise to nine mutants. The mutants are constructed and designated as listed in Table I. Purification of these mutants was the same as that of WT PDI.Table ICys to Ser mutants of PDI and their designationN-terminal active site36CGHC39b′ domainC-terminal active site380CGHC383DesignationCys295Cys326CGHCCysCysCGHCWt-PDI (NCC:BCC:CCC)CGHCCysCysSGHSNCC:BCC:CSSCGHSCysCysSGHSNCS:BCC:CSSSGHCCysCysSGHSNSC:BCC:CSSSGHSCysCysCGHCNSS:BCC:CCCSGHSCysCysSGHSNSS:BCC:CSSSGHSSerCysSGHSNSS:BSC:CSSSGHSCysSerSGHSNSS:BCS:CSSSGHSSerSerSGHSNSS:BSS:CSS Open table in a new tab Biophysical Analysis—Far UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco 725 spectrophotometer using a cell with a path length of 0.1 cm. Fluorescence spectra were collected on an F-2500 spectrofluorometer using a 1-ml cuvette, excitation at 285 nm and emission in the range of 300–400 nm. The concentrations of the PDI species are 10 μm. All resultant spectra were collected at 25 °C as an average of five scans. Denaturation and Reactivation of CK—CK (with a final concentration of 242 μm) was completely denatured in 3 m GdnHCl at 25 °C overnight. Reactivation was carried out by a 121-fold dilution of the denatured enzyme into 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing various PDI species at different concentrations. The final concentration of CK was 2 μm. At suitable intervals 10 μl of the sample was used for activity assay according to the pH colorimetry method (17.Yao Q.Z. Zhou H.M. Hou L.X. Tsou C.L. Sci. Sin. 1982; 25: 1296-1302Google Scholar). After refolding for 4 h, DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mm for an incubation period of 2 h, and then CK activity was remeasured. All the reactions were conducted at 25 °C, and all the measurements were repeated at least 3 times. Non-reduced SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Samples containing PDI and CK at a molar ratio of 5 were used for non-reduced SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Before non-reduced SDS-PAGE was carried out, N-ethylmaleimide was added to a final concentration of 5mm to stop the disulfide exchange. Western blot was carried out after 10% non-reduced SDS-PAGE with mouse anti-PDI monoclonal antibody as the primary antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse antibody as the secondary antibody. Aggregation of Denatured CK in the Presence of Various PDI Species—3 m GdnHCl denatured CK was diluted into 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer with or without 10 mm DTT in the presence of various PDI species at different concentrations. Aggregation was followed by monitoring the turbidity at 400 nm with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda Bio UV spectrophotometer at 25 °C. All the measurements were repeated at least three times. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) Analysis—Samples containing PDI and CK at a molar ratio of 5 were chosen for SEC analysis with a Superdex HR200 column. Then samples were combined with 10 mm DTT for 2 h at 25 °C and used for SEC analysis. All the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min before loading. The SEC was recorded with an ÄKTA purifier. Each peak was collected for further analysis by reduced SDS-PAGE. CK Refolding in the Presence of WT PDI—To characterize the effect of PDI on CK refolding, the reactivation and aggregation of CK without or with various amounts of PDI was investigated first. Similar to the results reported previously (19.Leydier C. Clottes E. Couthon F. Marcillat O. Ebel C. Vial C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17579-17589Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), GdnHCl-denatured CK could refold to about 45% of the activity of native CK after being diluted into 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer to a final concentration of 2 μm, and nonnative aggregation was observed along with the refolding process (Fig. 1). It was surprising to find that the reactivation of CK was gradually inhibited by the addition of WT PDI with concentrations higher than 1 μm (Fig. 1A), although PDI could successfully depress the aggregation of CK in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 1B). When DTT was added to the above samples, the CK activity measured burst up to nearly or even higher than that of the self-refolding CK (Fig. 2A), and the changes in CK activities after the addition of DTT became more and more obvious with the increase of the ratio of PDI and CK (Fig. 2D). The results indicated the release of additional free CK molecules, which could efficiently refold to its native state. As a control, the activity of self-refolding CK was not affected by the addition of DTT, which suggested that the additional free CK molecules released by DTT were not from the nonnative aggregates but more likely from PDI-CK complexes. These results also suggested that the inhibition effect of WT PDI on the reactivation of CK in DTT-free solutions might be due to the formation of complexes through intermolecular disulfide bonds. To verify this hypothesis, PDI mutants with some certain cysteines mutated to serines were constructed (Table I). Cys-36 and Cys-295 of PDI Play a Central Role in the Inhibition Effect on CK Reactivation—Mutational analysis were used to characterize the central cysteine(s) in PDI-CK complex formation. Besides the six cysteines in the N- and C-terminal active site, the two cysteines in the b′ domain were also considered. First of all WT PDI and the nine mutants (Table I) were constructed for biophysical analysis. CD spectra of the PDI species showed only little differences (Fig. 3A), whereas the intrinsic fluorescence spectra were undistinguishable between the WT PDI and mutants (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that both the secondary and the tertiary structures of the PDI mutants were unaffected by mutation. The reactivation of CK in the presence of different PDI mutants at different molar ratios revealed quite different behaviors when compared with WT PDI (Fig. 2). According to the changes in CK activities before and after the addition of DTT, the mutants can be classified into three classes, and the changes of typical species in each class are shown in Fig. 2, A–C, respectively. NCC:BCC: CSS and NCS:BCC:CSS demonstrated a significant activity-enhancing effect (several times enhancing when [PDI]/[CK] was larger than 2) after the addition of DTT, which was similar to WT PDI (Fig. 2A). NSS:BCC:CCC, NSC:BCC:CSS, NSS:BCC:CSS, and NSS:BCS:CSS had less inhibition effect on CK reactivation and exhibited less enhancing effect (Fig. 2B), whereas no significant changes could be detected for NSS:BSC:CSS and NSS: BSS:CSS (Fig. 2C). A clearer result can be seen in Fig. 2D in the plot of the logarithm of the recovered CK activity before and after the addition of DTT in the presence of various PDI species. A close inspection of Fig. 2D indicated that mutations of Cys-36, the cysteine in the N-terminal active site (a domain), and Cys-295, the non-active site cysteine in the b′ domain of PDI, could effectively eliminate the inhibition effect of WT PDI on CK reactivation in DTT-free conditions. This result suggested that Cys-36 and Cys-295 of PDI might be involved in the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds with CK and were responsible for the inhibition effect of PDI on CK. The Existence of the Disulfide-linked Complex and the Dimer to Tetramer Switch of PDI—More direct evidence of the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between PDI and CK came from the characterization of the PDI-CK complexes. The solutions of CK refolding in the presence of various PDI species in DTT-free conditions were first analyzed by non-reduced SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As a control, all the PDI species except NCS:BCC:CSS had only one band, whereas an additional band with a higher molecular weight was found for NCS:BCC:CSS (Fig. 4), which disappeared after the addition of DTT and was characterized to be a PDI tetramer linked by disulfide bonds by SEC analysis (see Supplemental Fig. 8B). This unusual tetramer peak might have been due to the cross-linking of Cys-36 between NCS:BCC:CSS dimers. For the samples of GdnHCl-denatured CK refolding in the presence of various PDI species containing Cys-36 or Cys-295, the formation of PDI-CK complexes could be identified by the appearance of some new high molecular weight bands. In contrast, no new bands could be found for NSS:BSC:CSS or NSS:BSS:CSS (Fig. 4). The results here confirmed the existence of the disulfide-linked complexes between PDI and CK, and once more they revealed that Cys-36 and Cys-295 were responsible for the formation of the complexes. A further characterization of the complexes was carried out using samples of CK refolding in the presence of various PDI species with or without DTT by SEC analysis. Samples containing PDI and CK at a molar ratio of five were chosen for SEC analysis. As a control, no complex peaks could be observed in the SEC spectra of samples prepared by directly mixing solutions of WT PDI and native CK either with or without DTT (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5A, in addition to the peaks from WT PDI and CK, two new peaks appeared in the SEC spectrum of the CK refolding sample assisted by WT PDI. One peak appeared at the void volume (≥400 kDa), and another one appeared at a molecular mass of about 200 kDa. The two new peaks in the SEC spectra (Fig. 5A) were further confirmed to contain both WT PDI and CK by reduced SDS-PAGE, which indicated that these two new peaks were the complexes formed between PDI and CK. According to the molecular mass, the 400-kDa peak could be assigned to two dimeric PDI and two dimeric CK, whereas the 200-kDa peak could be assign to one dimeric PDI and one dimeric CK (also see “Discussion”). When DTT was added to the above CK refolding sample, the amount of the 400-kDa peak was found to decrease gradually (Fig. 5B). Reduced SDS-PAGE showed that the remainder of this peak contained both WT PDI and CK, which suggested that the addition of DTT destabilized the 400-kDa peak. Surprisingly, the peak around 200 kDa still existed, and it only contained WT PDI, which suggested that it might be tetrameric PDI according to the molecular mass. At the same time, the peak of refolded CK increased to an amount similar to the self-refolding CK control, indicating that most CK was released from the PDI-CK complexes. These results from SEC and reduced SDS-PAGE analysis further confirmed that the formation of disulfide-linked complexes between PDI and CK was responsible for the inhibition effect of WT PDI on CK reactivation in DTT-free conditions. A more interesting observation was the appearance of tetrameric PDI after the addition of DTT, which suggested that the transition of dimer to tetramer might be an essential step in PDI-assisted CK refolding. PDI Exhibits Both Anti-chaperone and Chaperone Activity in Its Assisted CK Refolding—It has been reported that PDI functioned as an anti-chaperone at lower concentrations (11.Primm T.D. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20.Puig A. Lyles M.M. Noiva R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19128-19135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our systems, strong aggregation occurred upon the dilution of GdnHCl-denatured CK into 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 2 μm (Fig. 1B). The addition of 0.2 μm WT PDI facilitated the aggregation of CK during refolding. To further characterize whether the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond was involved, the precipitation was analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). It was found that the precipitation contained both PDI and CK for all samples in DTT-free (Fig. 6A) or DTT-containing buffer (Fig. 6B). Thus the anti-chaperone activity of PDI at low concentrations resulted from non-covalent cross-linking rather than the cross-linking of the disulfide bonds. These observations were quite consistent with those in previous studies (11.Primm T.D. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20.Puig A. Lyles M.M. Noiva R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19128-19135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Song J.L. Quan H. Wang C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At higher concentrations (≥1 μm), PDI could efficiently inhibit the aggregation of CK in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Thus, PDI should still be taken as a chaperone at higher concentrations (≥1 μm), although WT PDI gradually inhibited the reactivation of CK in DTT-free conditions. However, this inhibition effect could be reversed by the addition of DTT and resulted in a slight increase in the recovered activity relative to self-refolding CK (Fig. 2A). Moreover, NSS:BSS:CSS, a mutant of PDI without any cysteines, did assist the reactivation of unfolded CK (Fig. 2C). The abilities of various PDI species to inhibit aggregation behaved slightly differently when the buffer contained 10 mm DTT (Fig. 7). A more direct comparison of the changes in the abilities of the PDI mutants to depress CK aggregation with or without DTT was presented in Fig. 7D. Compared with that in DTT-free buffer, a relatively large decrease in the abilities to depress CK aggregation was found for WT PDI, NCC:BCC:CSS, and NCS:BCC:CSS in DTT-containing buffer (Fig. 7A), a slight decrease was found for NSS:BCC:CCC, NSC:BCC:CSS, NSS:BCC: CSS, and NSS:BCS:CSS (Fig. 7B), whereas no significant change was found for NSS:BSC:CSS or NSS:BSS:CSS (Fig. 7C). It should also be noted that all the PDI mutants could strongly inhibit the aggregation of CK whether in the DTT-free or DTT-containing buffer (Fig. 7A–C), although the abilities of some of the PDI species to depress CK aggregation could be affected by DTT (Fig. 7, A and B). These results suggested that the formation of disulfide bonds between PDI and CK contributed to the suppression of CK aggregation during refolding but was not the major driving force. PDI has been demonstrated to act as a molecular chaperone independent of its isomerase activity (21.Song J.L. Quan H. Wang C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22.Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Quan H. Fan G.B.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25.Wang C.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and it can exploit the synergy between these functions, especially when disulfide reshuffling is needed in the refolding of the substrates (3.Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26.Bulleid N.J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that WT PDI at high concentrations could act as a protector against aggregation but acted as an inhibitor of reactivation during CK refolding. The inhibition effect of PDI on CK reactivation was further characterized as being due to the formation of PDI-CK complexes through intermolecular disulfide bonds. In general, the hydrophobic interaction between PDI and its substrates is the major driving force of the binding (12.Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Since no disulfide bond is required for CK reactivation, the catalysis of thiol-disulfide interchange by PDI will not happen. Thus, the protection effect of PDI on CK aggregation could be attributed to its chaperone activity mainly through hydrophobic interactions, whereas the inhibition effect on CK reactivation could be attributed to its uncompleted isomerase activity through the cross-linking of intermolecular disulfide bonds. This hypothesis was further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (Figs. 2 and 7), which indicated that PDI without any cysteines could increase the reactivation of CK and gradually depressed the formation of aggregates during CK refolding in either DTT-free or DTT-containing conditions. The more N-terminal cysteine, Cys-36 or Cys-380, in each active site of PDI has been characterized as playing a central role in its isomerase activity (27.Laboissière M.C.A. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T.

Cell. 1993; 74: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29.Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal active site was considered to contribute more to the whole isomerase activity of PDI (30.Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30946-30952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The non-active site cysteines in the b′ domain were reported not to be required for the catalytic activity in human PDI (7.Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and unlikely to participate in substrate binding (9.Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, our results indicated that Cys-36 and Cys-295 were involved in the cross-linking of intermolecular disulfide bonds, whereas Cys-380 was not required. A possible explanation was that the binding of unfolded CK to PDI might have sequence specificity, as that had been demonstrated in pancreas-specific PDI (31.Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Langenbuch M. Lan M.S. Robinson G.K. Ruddock L.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32.Ruddock L.W. Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The specific recognition made the binding of PDI to unfolded CK directional, and this resulted in the exposure of a certain cysteine of CK that was conformationally close to Cys-36 but not to Cys-380. The participation of Cys-295 in the formation of disulfide bonds with CK might also result from the specific binding of PDI to CK. Moreover, it was noteworthy that a recent study reported that Cys-295 is located near the ligand binding site of PDI (9.Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which further suggested that the ligand binding site near Cys-295 of PDI might also be one of the specific binding sites of large proteins like CK. It has been widely accepted that PDI is a dimer, although it had been shown to be a mixture of dimer and tetramer at 4 °C and pH 7.5 in a previous study (33.Yu X.C. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The changes from dimer to oligomer, however, have never been reported to be required for PDI to function as a chaperone or foldase. In our research, two disulfide-linked PDI-CK complexes, a 400-kDa one and a 200-kDa one, which appeared during CK refolding in DTT-free conditions, were characterized by SEC and reduced SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 5). Our previous work indicated that unfolded monomeric CK could rapidly form inactive dimeric folding intermediates upon dilution to a refolding buffer and that the dimerization of CK was not the rate-limiting step during the refolding process (34.Wang Z.F. Yang Y. Zhou H.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that GroEL could strongly bind an inactive dimeric intermediate of CK (14.Li S. Bai J.H. Park Y.D. Zhou H.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). According to all these previous observations, CK in the 400- or 200-kDa complexes was more likely to be an inactive dimeric folding intermediate. Thus the 400-kDa peak was assigned to complexes containing 2 dimeric PDIs and 2 dimeric CKs, whereas the 200-kDa peak was assigned to complexes containing 1 dimeric PDI and 1 dimeric CK. The conformational state of the 400-kDa peak was further characterized by comparing the SEC results of DTT-free (Fig. 5A) and DTT-containing conditions (Fig. 5B). The 200-kDa complex in the DTT-containing conditions was found to be formed by PDI without CK, which suggested that this complex was a PDI tetramer. At the same time, the 400-kDa peak in Fig. 5B gradually decreased, and the peak of CK increased in comparison to Fig. 5A, which suggested that the existence of DTT destabilized the 400- and 200-kDa complexes and released the cross-linked CK from the complexes. Further identification of the PDI tetramer was obtained by SEC analysis of CK refolding in the presence of various mutants constructed in this study (see Supplemental Fig. 8). Although a rather different behavior could be observed for different mutants, PDI tetramer was found in all samples. Similar to the previous report (33.Yu X.C. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the PDI tetramer that occurred in the CK refolding process was not formed by cross-linking of disulfides between PDI dimers but rather by specific oligomerization interfaces. The effect of NCC: BCC:CSS on CK refolding was almost the same as that of WT PDI, which suggested that the mutations of Cys in the a′ domain did not affect the function of PDI in its assisting CK refolding. The decrease of the 400-kDa peak in profiles of CK refolding in the presence of NSS:BCC:CCC, NSC:BCC:CSS, NSS: BCC:CSS, and NSS:BCS:CSS might be due to the slightly decreased stability of the PDI-CK complex for these species. These results by SEC analysis further suggested that the transition from dimer to tetramer might be an essential step in the process of PDI-assisted CK refolding. Our research strongly suggested that the transition from dimer to tetramer was involved in PDI activities in assisting the folding of large proteins. However, several important issues still remain to be answered. (i) Is there another inverse transition from tetramer to dimer in its assisting the refolding of large proteins requiring the formation of native disulfide bonds? Since the major component of PDI in native conditions is a dimer, such an inverse process might exist although it could not be distinguished in this research. (ii) Is this transition from dimer to tetramer specific for the substrate CK? As described in the introduction, the PDI tetramer might not accumulate for substrates containing native disulfide bonds due to the thiol-disulfide interchange and the low stability of both the complex and the tetramer. However, such an accumulation might be achieved by using a substrate containing Cys but no native disulfide bonds. Primm et al. (11.Primm T.D. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) had reported a large soluble complex (≥500 kDa) of PDI and ADH by gel filtration HPLC analysis. This PDI-ADH complex was quite similar to the 400-kDa PDI-CK complex in this research. Tetrameric PDI might also be involved in the PDI-ADH complex (>500 kDa), although the model suggested that the complex might be formed between two dimeric PDI and two unfolded protein substrate (11.Primm T.D. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). (iii) It is also not clear yet whether the changes in oligomerization of PDI can take place in vivo or not. Nevertheless, the widely reported examples for such a transition of many chaperones, such as small heat shock proteins (Hsp) (35.Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), Hsp90 (36.Chadli A. Ladjimi M.M. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4133-4139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and some other chaperones (37.Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16760-16769Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 38.Jorgensen C.S. Ryder L.R. Steino A. Hojrup P. Hansen J. Beyer N.H. Heegaard N.H. Houen G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4140-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggested that such a switch from dimer to tetramer might be involved in the functions of PDI. According to the unusual experimental observations in this research and our previous work on the folding pathways of CK (14.Li S. Bai J.H. Park Y.D. Zhou H.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15.Park Y.D. Ou W.B. Yu T.W. Zhou H.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 34.Wang Z.F. Yang Y. Zhou H.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a working model was proposed for the molecular mechanism of CK refolding catalyzed by PDI (Scheme I). Previous work showed that the native dimeric CK (N) dissociated to monomers (U) upon denaturation (kdena). When diluted into the refolding buffer, the monomers can form inactive dimeric folding intermediate (U2) in a very short time (kdim). Two fates of U2 were found; one was the formation of large insoluble aggregates through hydrophobic interaction (kself), and in the other, U2 undergoes a fast phase (k1) to the partially active dimer N2′. Then N2′ refolds to the active native-like form N2 through a slow phase (k2) and finally refolds to the native state after a very slow adjustment (ks-adju). When PDI is present in the buffer, it can bind the inactive dimeric intermediate U2, which further forms a soluble complex (U2P) (kb). If PDI is at a low concentration (0.2 μm), the excessive U2 binds with U2P through hydrophobic interaction, which results in the formation of large insoluble aggregates. In this way PDI facilitates the aggregation of CK and exhibits anti-chaperone activity (ka-chap). If PDI is at a higher concentration (≥1 μm), U2P further forms large disulfide-linked soluble complexes (PU2U2P, kb1). The intermolecular disulfide bonds between U2 and PDI prevent U2 from further refolding, and an inhibition effect is observed for CK reactivation. With the addition of DTT, the inactive dimeric intermediate CK (U2), dimeric PDI, or tetrameric PDI are released from the large complexes. Then U2 undergoes a fast phase and a slow phase and finally refolds to the native state. In conclusion, PDI was found to act as a protector against aggregation, which resulted from its chaperone function, and an inhibitor of reactivation, which arose partially from its uncompleted isomerase function, in CK refolding. The unusual observations in this research suggested that the two major functions of PDI were interrelated in its assisting CK refolding and further suggested that the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds through Cys-36 and Cys-295 and the switch of dimer to tetramer of PDI plays a crucial role in its activities. In our system the large PDI-CK complex (400 kDa) for WT PDI was strongly protected by the intermolecular disulfide bonds, whereas the mutation species had less stability. This implied the PDI tetramer might be short-lived in assisting the folding of proteins containing disulfide bonds due to the thiol-disulfide interchange and the potential hidden transition from tetramer to dimer. However, the consistence of our working model (Scheme I) with the previous findings in PDI activity as well as those in many chaperones suggested that this model might also work in other in vitro systems as well as in vivo conditions. A further investigation of the nature of the transition in oligomerization and the structures of both the dimer and tetramer forms of PDI should elucidate how PDI meets the specific requirements for large proteins.

Although it is expected that the last phases of this process must be tightly regulated since it results in cell death, the signaling pathways involved in this induction remain ill defined. We now report that a single kinase, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK), acts in the epidermis to promote the terminal differentiation of human keratinocytes. In support of this notion, we showed that DLK expression was restricted to the granular layer in situ. In addition, cultured keratinocytes infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing DLK exhibited morphological and biochemical changes, including a suprabasal localization, altered cell shape, compacted cytoplasm, DNA fragmentation, and the up-regulation of filaggrin, that are reminiscent of a terminally differentiated phenotype. Moreover the expression of wild-type DLK in keratinocytes stimulated transglutaminase activity and the consequent formation of the cornified cell envelope, while a kinase-inactive variant of DLK did not. Together these results identify DLK as a signaling molecule implicated in the regulation of keratinocyte terminal differentiation and cornification. In the skin, epithelial cells undergo a terminal differentiation program leading to the formation of the stratum corneum.

We now report that a single kinase, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK), acts in the epidermis to promote the terminal differentiation of human keratinocytes.

Together these results identify DLK as a signaling molecule implicated in the regulation of keratinocyte terminal differentiation and cornification. The epidermis is a self-renewing stratified epithelium mainly populated by keratinocytes that undergo a complex and dynamic program of terminal differentiation throughout life (1.Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2.Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). This process begins when proliferating keratinocytes of the innermost basal layer cease to divide and initiate their migration successively through the spinous, granular, and cornified cell layers (1.Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 3.Eckert R.L. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 1316-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Upon moving upward to the suprabasal layers of epidermis, the keratinocytes progressively acquire the ability to express in a sequential manner specific gene products that are required for differentiation. For instance, the expression of keratin 1 and keratin 10 starts in the spinous layer, whereas that of filaggrin, loricrin, cystatin A, and small proline-rich protein is primarily detected in the granular layer (2.Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 4.Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 5.Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The transition of cells from the upper granular to the cornified layer is accompanied by the elimination of all organelles (including the nuclei) and the activation of transglutaminases, which are essential for the assembly of an insoluble barrier structure termed the cornified cell envelope. Ultimately these events culminate in the production of the outermost epidermal layers, composed of flattened, enucleated, dead cornified cells (corneocytes) that ensure the skin barrier function (2.Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The ability of keratinocytes to differentiate is regulated by a number of biological signals derived from cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions that act through downstream signaling pathways (6.Szabowski A. Maas-Szabowski N. Andrecht S. Kolbus A. Schorpp-Kistner M. Fusenig N.E. Angel P. Cell. 2000; 103: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Among the pathways that are particularly important for the regulation of keratinocyte growth and differentiation are those involving phosphorylation cascades that lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AdDLK, recombinant adenovirus expressing the green fluorescent protein together with a T7 epitope-tagged form of wild-type DLK; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AdGFP, recombinant adenovirus expressing the green fluorescent protein; DLK, dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase; MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; NHK, normal human keratinocyte; TG1, transglutaminase 1; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling. In mammals, the MAPKs are classified into at least three distinct subfamilies of related polypeptides referred to as the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and the p38 kinases (7.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). The activation of these proteins in response to extracellular stimuli is catalyzed by specific upstream protein kinases known as MAPKKs, which are themselves substrates for a further upstream group of protein kinases, the MAPKKKs. Once activated, MAPKs transit from their primary cytoplasmic subcellular location to the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors, which in turn modulate the expression of prescribed sets of downstream effector genes (7.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Although some exceptions can be found in the literature, it is generally observed that ERK signaling in keratinocytes is linked to proliferation and survival (8.Hobbs R.M. Silva-Vargas V. Groves R. Watt F.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 123: 503-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas activation of the JNK and p38 cascades mediates prodifferentiation and proapoptotic responses (9.Eckert R.L. Efimova T. Dashti S.R. Balasubramanian S. Deucher A. Crish J.F. Sturniolo M. Bone F. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2002; 7: 36-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Evidence supporting the involvement of JNK in keratinocyte differentiation derives from the findings of Takahashi et al. (10.Takahashi H. Ibe M. Nakamura S. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Hashimoto Y. Iizuka H. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2002; 30: 94-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), who have shown by immunohistochemistry on normal human epidermis that the active phosphorylated form of JNK is present in keratinocytes of the upper spinous and granular layers. Moreover, in studies carried out in vitro with cultured normal human keratinocytes, these authors demonstrated that the expression of cystatin A, a key marker of differentiation, requires the activation of JNK (11.Takahashi H. Honma M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Iizuka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36632-36638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly experiments with cultured keratinocytes have also highlighted the importance of p38 MAPK signaling in the terminal differentiation of these epidermal cells. It has been proposed that a specific isoform of p38, named p38δ, plays a role in the differentiation of keratinocytes on the basis of the observation that its activation promotes involucrin gene expression (12.Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13.Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Dermatol. 2003; 120: 823-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition to JNK and p38, which might play complementary roles in the control of keratinocyte differentiation, numerous protein kinases acting as MAPKK and MAPKKK components of these signaling pathways have been reported to contribute to various aspects of this process. For example, overexpression experiments in cultured keratinocytes, using either activated or dominant-negative mutants, have shown that the MAPKKs MKK3, MKK6 (13.Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27214-27220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and MKK7 (15.Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8059-8063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as well as the MAPKKKs MEKK1 (12.Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (16.Sayama K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Yamasaki K. Sawada Y. Sun L. Yamanishi K. Ichijo H. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 999-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) are required for the induction of terminal differentiation markers such as involucrin, loricrin, and transglutaminase 1. Several lines of evidence suggest that DLK as well as its human homolog (also known as human leucine-zipper protein kinase (17.Reddy U.R. Pleasure D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) or its rat homolog (MAPK upstream kinase (18.Hirai S. Izawa M. Osada S. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar)), a serine/threonine kinase originally isolated from mouse embryonic kidney (19.Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is another particularly interesting MAPKKK that could also be implicated in regulating keratinocyte differentiation. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that DLK mRNA and protein are specifically expressed in the differentiated granular layer of human epidermis and in the inner root sheath of hair follicles (20.Germain L. Fradette J. Robitaille H. Guignard R. Grondin G. Nadeau A. Blouin R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 860-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which possess histological and histochemical characteristics comparable to those of keratinizing epidermal cells (21.Akiyama M. Matsuo I. Shimizu H. Br. J. Dermatol. 2002; 146: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, the transient expression of wild-type DLK by the transfection of normal human keratinocytes cultured on plastic is associated with the detection of filaggrin in these cells (20.Germain L. Fradette J. Robitaille H. Guignard R. Grondin G. Nadeau A. Blouin R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 860-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that DLK may play an active role in the mechanisms that regulate the terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. In an attempt to define more precisely the role of DLK in keratinocyte terminal differentiation, we extended the characterization of its expression in situ with normal human skin. Moreover cultured normal human keratinocytes were infected with an adenovirus vector expressing the wild-type form of DLK as a complementary model system to investigate the consequences of its expression on the late stages of terminal differentiation. Our results indicated that the expression of DLK in human skin was tightly linked to late epidermal differentiation. In addition, our results demonstrated that the expression of DLK induced phenotypic changes associated with keratinocyte terminal differentiation including the up-regulation of filaggrin, DNA fragmentation, the activation of transglutaminases, and the formation of a cornified cell envelope. Collectively these data demonstrated that DLK plays the role of an important regulator of the physiological events occurring during the final stage of the keratinocyte terminal differentiation program. Tissue and Cell Culture—Human newborn foreskin biopsies were embedded in OCT compound and stored at –80 °C. Normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) were isolated and cultured from a newborn foreskin as described previously (20.Germain L. Fradette J. Robitaille H. Guignard R. Grondin G. Nadeau A. Blouin R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 860-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were cultured on a feeder layer of irradiated mouse 3T3 fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 medium in a 3:1 proportion (Invitrogen) supplemented with 24.3 μg/ml adenine (Sigma), 5% fetalclone II (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Calbiochem), 10–10m cholera toxin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA), and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin G and 25 μg/ml gentamicin). Immunological Staining—Acetone-fixed (10 min at –20 °C) frozen sections (5 μm thick) of human tissues or formaldehyde (4%, 20 min at room temperature)-methanol (100%, 10 min at –20 °C)-fixed cultured cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (22.Michel M. Torok N. Godbout M.J. Lussier M. Gaudreau P. Royal A. Germain L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1017-1028PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were a rabbit antiserum directed against the N-terminal portion (223 amino acids) of recombinant mouse DLK (23.Douziech M. Laberge G. Grondin G. Daigle N. Blouin R. J.

The anti-DLK specifically recognized the mouse and human DLK proteins (20.Germain L. Fradette J. Robitaille H. Guignard R. Grondin G. Nadeau A. Blouin R. J. Investig.

Goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate was used as secondary antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Negative controls consisted of omission of the primary antibody during the labeling reaction. Cell nuclei were labeled with Hoechst reagent 33258 (Sigma). Adenoviruses and Infection of NHKs—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing the control green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) alone or together with T7 epitope-tagged wild-type (AdDLK) and kinase-defective (AdDLK(K185R)) DLK were described previously (24.Robitaille K.

Subconfluent cultures of NHKs were infected with the recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 or 50 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.8 mml-arginine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml amphotericin B. After 1 h, the medium was replaced, and the cells were incubated for 3 or 5 days before being processed for further analyses. Flow Cytometry Analysis—To evaluate DNA content, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol 72 and 120 h after infection. Fixed cells were then washed with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with propidium iodide for 15 min. Labeled cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). DNA Degradation Analysis—For DNA laddering, the DNA of infected and non-infected cells was extracted with DNA ladder Suicide Track™ (Oncogene Research) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Extracted DNA was fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide (Sigma). For the TUNEL assay, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 1% Triton 72 h postinfection. The cells were then incubated with a tetramethylrhodamine TUNEL reaction mixture according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics) and labeled with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Labeled cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Cornified Cell Envelope Assay—Cornified cell envelope formation was detected according to the method of Cline and Rice (25.Cline P.R. Rice R.H. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3203-3207PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly cells were harvested by trypsinization, treated with 1% sodium dodecylsulfate (Bio-Rad) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma), and boiled for 15 min at 100 °C. 5 μl of DNase (Calbiochem) were then added to the cell suspension. Detergent- and reducing agent-resistant cornified cell envelopes were visualized by light microscopy and counted in a hemacytometer. In Situ Transglutaminase Activity Assays—Infected cells were incubated 48 h postinfection with 10 μm tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-cadaverine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in culture medium. After a 24-h incubation, the cells were washed gently with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with acetic acid-ethanol-water (1:49:50) for 20 min. The cells were then washed with ethanol to reduce the background fluorescence. The nuclei of fixed cells were labeled with Hoechst 33258 and observed with a fluorescence microscope. Alternatively cells were labeled for 2 h with 1 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine. The cells were subsequently rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and sonicated on ice. The protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by the modified Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Transglutaminase activity was quantified by measuring the transglutaminase-dependent incorporation of 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine into proteins by a microplate assay as described previously (26.Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Normal human newborn foreskin biopsies were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 20 min. The fixed samples were washed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer and post-fixed with 1% OsO4 for 30 min. The samples were then embedded in LRWhite and cut into thin sections. Briefly the sections were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin and processed for immunogold labeling using a rabbit anti-DLK antibody and gold-conjugated (10-nm particles) goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (British Biocell International, Cardiff, UK). Sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate were observed with a JEOL 1200 EX transmission microscope. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed for 60 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the concentration of total protein in the supernatant fraction was quantified by the modified Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, equal amounts of proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Diagnostics) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% skim milk powder before addition of the primary antibody (1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C). The primary antibodies were mouse monoclonal anti-T7 (Novagen, Madison, WI), anti-p16 INK4, anti-p21 WAF1, anti-p27 Kip1 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA), anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-p44/42 ERK, rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK total, anti-p38 total, anti-p44/42 ERK total (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), and anti-actin (Sigma) antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (ECL Plus Western blotting kit, Amersham Biosciences). Immunocomplex Kinase Assay for DLK—Cultures of NHKs infected with the adenoviruses were harvested and homogenized in lysis buffer. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the concentration of total protein in the supernatant fraction was quantified using the modified Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Typically 600 μg of protein extract were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation using a T7 tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen, 1:2000 dilution) and protein A-Sepharose beads. After incubation, the immunocomplexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed by incubating the immune complexes in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 25 μm ATP, and 1 μg of myelin basic protein as a substrate. Following a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding an appropriate volume of 6× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography after fractionation by SDS-PAGE. DLK Exhibits a Differentiation-associated Localization in Normal Human Skin Epithelium—The cellular localization of endogenous DLK in normal human skin was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy with a specific antiserum raised against the recombinant mouse DLK (23.Douziech M. Laberge G. Grondin G. Daigle N. Blouin R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). DLK staining was restricted to the stratum granulosum, the upper suprabasal layers of living epidermis, where filaggrin, a terminal differentiation marker, was also found (Fig. 1A). Immunoelectron microscopy analysis of normal human skin confirmed this localization, showing that the immunoreactive protein was preferentially detected on the inner face of the plasma membrane in the keratinocytes of the granular layer (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that DLK expression is restricted to the most differentiated living keratinocytes in normal human skin. DLK Mediates JNK Activation in Normal Human Keratinocytes—To address the possibility that DLK plays a functional role in the late stages of terminal differentiation, we examined the effects of its forced expression using an in vitro model of poorly differentiated NHKs (cultured on plastic substrate). For this purpose, NHKs were infected at an m.o.i. of 10 or 50 with recombinant adenoviruses expressing the control green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) alone or together with a T7 epitope-tagged form of wild-type DLK (AdDLK). The expression of DLK in infected cells was confirmed by probing a Western blot of the lysates with the T7 antibody (Fig. 2A). As expected, the abundance of DLK in infected cells correlated with the amount of virally transduced cDNAs. The activity of DLK was also determined in the cell lysates by an immunocomplex kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate (Fig. 2A). Our results using this assay indicate that the kinase activity of wild-type DLK in infected cells increased in an m.o.i.-dependent manner. In comparison, no activation of DLK was detected in non-infected or AdGFP-infected keratinocytes. Since DLK is an essential component of the JNK MAPK pathway (27.Fan G. Merritt S.E. Kortenjann M. Shaw P.E. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24788-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we tested whether the activity of endogenous JNK was modulated in cells infected with the adenovirus vectors at an m.o.i. of 10 or 50. JNK activity was determined in the lysates from these cells by immunoblotting experiments with an antibody specific to the phosphorylated and activated form of JNK. Fig. 2B shows that DLK expression in keratinocytes infected at an m.o.i. of 50 induced sustained activation of endogenous JNK, while no such effect was observed in keratinocytes infected at an m.o.i. of 10, in mock-infected cells, or in cells infected with AdGFP. Immunoblots processed in parallel with an antibody that is insensitive to the phosphorylation state of JNK confirmed that the increase in kinase activity was not attributable to variations in JNK protein levels (Fig. 2B). In conjunction with these experiments, we also investigated the consequences of DLK expression on p38 MAPK and ERK activity by immunoblotting with phosphospecific and phospho-independent antibodies. The results shown in Fig. 2B demonstrate that both p38 and ERK exist as constitutively phosphorylated proteins in intact NHKs cultured under our experimental conditions. When these cells were infected with AdDLK at an m.o.i. of 10 or 50, no effect on the phosphorylation level of p38 was observed, while expression of DLK was found to slightly stimulate the activity of ERK (Fig. 2B). Thus, the expression of DLK preferentially stimulates the activity of endogenous JNK in NHKs. Expression of DLK in NHKs Induces Morphological Changes Characteristic of Terminal Differentiation—Microscopic examination of NHKs infected at an m.o.i. of 50 with the adenovirus vectors revealed that DLK expression induces morphological changes associated with terminal differentiation. Indeed 72 h after infection, cells expressing DLK were flattened and located on top of the keratinocyte colonies. In contrast to this suprabasal localization, NHKs infected with AdGFP remained in the basal layer (Fig. 3). DLK expression in NHKs also promoted the formation of cytoplasmic granules (Fig. 3). Interestingly adenovirus-mediated expression of DLK was accompanied by an increase in the number of cells with nuclei exhibiting chromatin condensation as revealed by Hoechst staining (Fig. 3). To complement these observations, we characterized in more detail the effects of DLK expression on DNA by flow cytometry, TUNEL cytochemistry staining, and DNA gel electrophoresis. As seen in Fig. 4A, flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells showed that expression of DLK reduced the percentage of NHKs in the G0/G1 phase by 12% as compared with the control. This reduction was paralleled by a marked increase (14%) in the proportion of cells in the sub-G1 population, indicating that extensive DNA degradation occurred. Consistent with these flow cytometry results, AdDLK induced a significant increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells compared with AdGFP-infected control cells (Fig. 4B). Finally, as predicted from these findings, the DNA laddering analysis revealed that DNA was fragmented in AdDLK-but not in AdGFP-infected cells (Fig. 4C). Collectively the results obtained with three different techniques suggest that DLK may contribute to the process of DNA fragmentation that is inherent to the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes.Fig. 4DLK expression in keratinocytes induces DNA cleavage.A, NHKs were infected at an m.o.i. of 50 with AdDLK or AdGFP. 3 days after infection, the nuclei were labeled with propidium iodide, and their DNA content was determined by flow cytometry. Values are the average of three independent experiments. B, NHKs were infected at an m.o.i. of 50 with AdDLK or AdGFP. After 3 days, cells were fixed and stained for DNA cleavage by the TUNEL assay. The nuclei were visualized by staining the DNA with Hoechst. C, NHKs were infected at an m.o.i. of 50 with AdDLK or AdGFP or mock-infected and harvested 3 days postinfection to assess DNA ladder formation.

https://openalex.org/W2003280609,"The basement membrane protein laminin-5 (LN5; α3β3γ2) undergoes specific proteolytic processing of the 190-kDa α3 chain to the 160-kDa form after the secretion, releasing its COOH-terminal, LG4–5 domain. To clarify the biological significance of this processing, we tried to express a recombinant precursor LN5 with a 190-kDa α3 chain (pre-LN5), in which the cleavage sequence Gln-Asp was changed to Ala-Ala by point mutation. When the wild-type and mutated LN5 heterotrimers were expressed in HEK293 cells, the wild-type α3 chain was completely cleaved, whereas the mutated α3 chain was partially cleaved at the same cleavage site (Ala-Ala). pre-LN5 was preferentially deposited on the extracellular matrix, but this deposition was effectively blocked by exogenous heparin. This suggests that interaction between the LG4–5 domain and heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface and/or extracellular matrix is important in the matrix assembly of LN5. Next, we purified both pre-LN5 and the mature LN5 with the processed, 160-kDa α3 chain (mat-LN5) from the conditioned medium of the HEK293 cells and compared their biological activities. mat-LN5 showed higher activities to promote cell adhesion, cell scattering, cell migration, and neurite outgrowth than pre-LN5. These results indicate that the proteolytic removal of LG4–5 from the 190-kDa α3 chain converts the precursor LN5 from a less active form to a fully active form. Furthermore, the released LG4–5 fragment stimulated the neurite outgrowth in the presence of mat-LN5, suggesting that LG4–5 synergistically enhances integrin signaling as it is released from the precursor LN5.

The basement membrane proteins laminins plays essential roles in both tissue construction and regulation of cellular functions. The laminin molecules consist of the three subunits (or chains) of α, β, and γ, linked by disulfide bonds to form the well known cross-shape structure. To date, more than 16 laminin isoforms with different combinations of five α, three β, and three γ chains have been identified (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 2Libby R.T. Champliaud M.F. Claudepierre T. Xu Y. Gibbons E.P. Koch M. Burgeson R.E. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24774-24784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Each laminin chain contains many functional domains, which allow the laminins to interact with various molecules in the extracellular matrix (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FCS, fetal calf serum; LG domain, laminin globular domain; LN5, laminin-5; pre-LN5, recombinant LN5 with a mutated 190-kDa α3 chain; mat-LN5, recombinant LN5 with a 160-kDa, processed α3 chain; PBS, Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; NGF, nerve growth factor; BRL, buffalo rat liver. For example, laminin α chains (α1 to α5) contain a large globular domain (laminin globular domain, LG domain) in their COOH termini, which is divided into five homologous subdomains (LG1–LG5). The LG domain is thought to be a major site to interact with specific receptors on cell surface, such as integrins, syndecans, and α-dystroglycan, whereas the NH2-terminal regions of the α, β, and γ chains contain functional domains that are mainly involved in the matrix assembly (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Because of these complex structures, partial proteolysis of laminins alters their biological activities. One of the laminin isoforms, laminin-5 (α3β3γ2; LN5), was originally found as an anchoring filament component of keratinocyte (4Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 5Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and as a cell scatter factor secreted by gastric carcinoma cells (6Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11767-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). LN5 has strong activities to promote cellular adhesion, motility, and cell scattering in culture (7Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These activities are mediated by integrins α3β1, α6β4, and α6β1 (5Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 7Kikkawa Y.

Biochem. 2003; 88: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The LG domain of α3 chain contains several integrin-binding sites (10Mizushima H. Takamura H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar), and the LG3 domain plays a critical role in the expression of the unique activities of LN5 (9Kariya Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33045-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The association of LN5 with integrin α6β4 is essential for the stable hemidesmosome structure (13Baker S.E. Hopkinson S.B. Fitchmun M. Andreason G.L. Frasier F. Plopper G. Quaranta V. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thereby it supports the stable anchorage of epidermal keratinocytes to the underlying connective tissues in vivo (14Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Sonnenberg A. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the cell migration-promoting activity of LN5 is thought to contribute to wound healing (15Nguyen B.P. Ryan M.C. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). LN5 is synthesized and secreted as a precursor form consisting of a 190-kDa α3 chain, a 135-kDa β3 chain, and a 150-kDa γ2 chain. After secretion, the α3 and γ2 chains undergo specific extracellular proteolytic processing to convert to the mature form containing a 160-kDa α3 chain and a 105-kDa γ2 chain (16Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Matsui C. Wang C.K. Nelson C.F. Bauer E.A. Hoeffler W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23496-23503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Much attention has been focused on the physiological consequence of this processing of LN5. Laminin γ2 chain is cleaved at its NH2-terminal region by BMP-1/mTLD proteinases (18Amano S. Scott I.C. Takahara K. Koch M. Gerecke D.R. Keene D.R. Hudson D.L. Nishiyama T. Lee S. Greenspan D.S.

In rat LN5, the cleavage of the 150-kDa γ2 chain to a 80-kDa form by gelatinase A (matrix metalloproteinase-2) or membrane type-1-MMP elevates its cell motility activity (20Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 21Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Similarly, the cleavage of the 150-kDa γ2 chain to a 105-kDa form in human LN5 increases its cell motility activity but decreases its cell adhesion activity (22Ogawa T. Tsubota Y. Maeda M. Kariya Y. Miyazaki K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The proteolytic processing of the α3 chain occurs much more efficiently than that of the γ2 chain. Therefore, it is difficult to detect the precursor LN5 with the unprocessed α3 chain in the conditioned medium and ECM of LN5-producing cells (17Matsui C. Wang C.K. Nelson C.F. Bauer E.A. Hoeffler W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23496-23503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the 190-kDa α3 chain of LN5 is cleaved between the LG3 and LG4 domains, releasing an LG4–5 fragment (11Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Tsubota Y. Mizushima H. Hirosaki T. Higashi S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the physiological meaning of the α3 chain cleavage is controversial. It was reported that the cleavage of the 190-kDa α3 chain to a 160-kDa form decreases the cell motility activity of LN5 and promotes stable cell anchorage (24Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The mature LN5 with the 160-kDa α3 chain induces the nucleation of hemidesmosome assembly through interaction with integrin α6β4 (13Baker S.E. Hopkinson S.B. Fitchmun M. Andreason G.L. Frasier F. Plopper G. Quaranta V. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the skin is injured, the precursor LN5 with the unprocessed α3 chain is deposited in the provisional matrix by leading keratinocytes, which appears to support migration of following cells toward the wound edge (15Nguyen B.P. Ryan M.C. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 24Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44168-44177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To the contrary, other studies have shown that the LN5 with the processed α3 chain supports rapid migration of various types of cells (6Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11767-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J.

Cancer. 1998; 76: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In a case of laminin-6 (LN6; α3β1γ1), the same cleavage of the α3 chain activates this laminin, increasing both the cell adhesion and cell migration activities (27Hirosaki T. Tsubota Y. Kariya Y. Moriyama K. Mizushima H. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49287-49295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological significance of the α3 chain cleavage still remains to be unclear. No past studies have directly compared the functional difference between the processed and unprocessed LN5 forms, using the purified proteins. In this study, therefore, we prepared a recombinant LN5 with an unprocessed α3 chain and compared the biological activities of the two LN5 forms with the processed or unprocessed α3 chain. Cell Culture—LN5-HEK and β3γ2-HEK cell lines were previously established by transfecting HEK293 cells with the cDNAs of human laminin α3, β3, and γ2 chains and with those of the β3 and γ2 chains, respectively (28Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). LN5-HEK cells secrete the human recombinant LN5 heterotrimer at a high level. The non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line (BRL) derived from Buffalo rat liver has been used in previous studies (6Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11767-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Tsubota Y. Mizushima H. Hirosaki T. Higashi S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 was obtained from the Japanese Cancer Resource Bank (Tokyo, Japan). These cell lines were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium, DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate. A spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT (29Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3476) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. N. E. Fusenig (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany), and maintained in DMEM (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% FCS. PC12/HS, a clone of PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells that responds to nerve growth factor (NGF) with a high sensitivity, was kindly given by Dr. Hiroshi Iizuka (30Iizuka H. Umeda M. Brain Res. 1992; 599: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% FCS on plastic dishes precoated with 30 μg/ml of type-I collagen (Koken, Tokyo, Japan). cDNA Construction and Transfection—Human laminin α3 chain (α3A) cDNA has been cloned from a cDNA library of gastric cancer cells (31Mizushima H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To convert two amino acid residues at the processing site of laminin α3 chain, Gln1337 and Asp1338, to Ala, the site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the inverted PCR method reported by Imai et al. (32Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The EcoRI/SmaI fragment of the α3 cDNA (nucleotides 3293–4406) was cloned into the EcoRI/HincII sites of pGEM-3Zf (+) and used as a template. The whole sequence of the template was amplified with a mutagenesis primer pair designed in the inverted tail-to-tail direction. The sequence of primers used were as follows: the primer α3/AA-3′ (sense, 4010–4031), 5′-ccGcCACACCAGTGGCCTCCCC-3′; and the primer α3/AA-5′ (antisense, 3983–4009), 5′-ctAGCAGCTGGTTGATACGAAAAGTCT-3′, in which the small letters indicate the base substitution to convert both Gln1337 and Asp1338 to Ala, and the underlined letters indicate additional base substitution to introduce a unique NheI site for rapid screening of mutated clones. The amplified linear DNA was self-ligated to transform Escherichia coli. The mutated clones thus created were screened by NheI digestion, and these sequences were verified with DNA sequence analysis. The ClaI/ApaI fragment of laminin α3 cDNA (3730–4403) in pGEM-LS/CX (11Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was replaced with the corresponding region of the mutated fragment to construct the full-length cDNA of mutant α3 chain (α3AA) (pGEM-LS/CX/AA). The full-length cDNA of α3/AA chain was released with XbaI from pGEM-LS/CX/AA and cloned into the XbaI site of the pcDNA3.1-Hygro(+) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) to make α3/AA-pcDNA3.1-Hygro. The α3/AA-pcDNA3.1-Hygro was transfected into β3γ2-HEK cells as described previously (28Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The α3/AA-transfected β3γ2-HEK cells were cloned and expanded in 10% FCS-DMEM/F-12 containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Sigma), 300 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Wako, Osaka, Japan). One of the clones highly expressing the introduced α3/AA chain was used in this study (hereafter referred as LN5AA-HEK). Preparation of Conditioned Media and ECMs—HEK cells expressing recombinant LN5 were grown to confluence in 90-mm culture dishes with 10% FCS-DMEM/F-12. Confluent cultures were washed twice with Ca2+-Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and further incubated in serum-free DMEM/F-12 for 2 days. The resultant serum-free conditioned media were collected, dialyzed against pure water, and concentrated by lyophilization. After collecting the serum-free conditioned media, the cells in the dishes were lysed with 20 mm NH4OH (24Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and the remaining ECM components on the dishes were washed with PBS and then solubilized in a sample buffer containing 3% SDS in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). To examine the effect of heparin on LN5 deposition, LN5AA-HEK cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per 35-mm culture dish in 10% FCS-DMEM/F-12. After incubation overnight, the media were changed to fresh serum-free DMEM/F-12 with or without heparin (Wako) at various concentrations, and further incubated for 2 days. The resultant conditioned media and ECMs were prepared as described above. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting Analyses—SDS-PAGE was performed on 6% gels under reducing conditions or 4–7.5% gradient gel under non-reducing conditions. In the case of purified proteins, separated proteins were stained with a Wako silver staining kit II (Wako). For immunoblotting, proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The three subunits of LN5 were detected with specific antibodies using ECL-kit (Amersham Biosciences). The monoclonal antibodies used are a mouse monoclonal antibody against the NH2-terminal region of human laminin α3 chain (LSαc1), a mouse monoclonal antibody against human laminin β3 chain (Anti-Kalinin B1) (BD Transduction Laboratory), and a mouse monoclonal antibody against domain III of human laminin γ2 chain (D4B5). LSαc1 and D4B5 were prepared in our laboratory. Purification of Two LN5 Forms—Serum-free conditioned medium of LN5AA-HEK cells was prepared and fractionated by molecular-sieve chromatography on a Sepharose 4B column (2.6 × 98 cm; Amersham Biosciences) according to the previously reported method (28Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The collected conditioned medium was previously incubated with 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to inactivate proteinase activities, and the column was previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS, 0.01% Brij 35, and 1 mm EDTA (TCBE buffer) supplemented with 500 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The fractions containing recombinant LN5 were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, diluted with TCBE buffer to decrease the NaCl concentration below 0.25 m, and then applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (2.6 × 10 cm; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with TCBE buffer supplemented with 0.25 m NaCl and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bound proteins were sequentially eluted with 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 m NaCl. The recombinant precursor LN5 with the 190-kDa α3 chain (pre-LN5) was purified from the 1.0 m NaCl fraction by immunoaffinity chromatography with the anti-laminin-α3 monoclonal antibody (LSα3c4) as described previously (28Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mature LN5 with the 160-kDa, processed α3 chain (mat-LN5) was purified from the 0.4 m NaCl fraction. Cell Adhesion Assay—The cell adhesion assay was performed as described previously (11Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Costar, Acton, MA) were coated with test samples in PBS at 4 °C overnight and then blocked with 1.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Cells were trypsinized and recovered in 10% FCS-containing medium at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times with and suspended in serum-free DMEM/F-12. The cell suspension (3 × 104 HaCaT cells or 4 × 104 BRL cells per 0.1 ml) was inoculated into each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Adherent cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, stained with 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet in 20% (v/v) methanol for 10 min, and washed with tap water. The dye was extracted with 0.1 m citrate in 50% methanol (v/v) for 30 min and measured for the absorbance at 590 nm using a microplate reader. Cell-scattering Assay—Assay of cell scattering activity was performed using BRL cells as reported before (33Kariya Y. Miyazaki K. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 508-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For analysis of soluble proteins, BRL cells (7000 cells) were seeded per well of 24-well culture plates (Sumibe Medical, Tokyo, Japan) containing 0.5 ml/well of DMEM/F-12 plus 1% FCS with a test sample. For analysis of insoluble proteins, test samples were previously coated on 24-well plates as described above. After 2 days in incubation, cell scattering was judged by microscopic observation. For the quantification of cell scattering, total cells and scattered, single cells were counted in three randomly selected microscope fields. At least 500 cells were counted in each field. The degree of cell scattering was expressed by the percentage of single cells in each field. In Vitro Wound-healing Assay—HaCaT cells in 10% FCS-DMEM medium were densely plated onto a 96-well plate (Sumibe) and allowed to attach to the wells. After 2- or 3-h incubation, each culture formed a monolayer sheet of cells. The confluent cell monolayer was scratched with a plastic pipette tip to create a cell-free zone in each well. The wells were washed with serum-free DMEM extensively to remove cellular debris. The wells were then incubated with test samples in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min to establish a fresh substrate surface on the cell-free zones, followed by washing with serum-free DMEM. The HaCaT cells were allowed to migrate from the cut edge of the scratch in fresh serum-free DMEM. Photographs were taken at 0 and 13 h. Assay of Neurite Outgrowth—Each well of 24-well plastic plates was coated with test samples at indicated concentrations in 500 μl of PBS at 4 °C overnight, and then washed with PBS. PC12/HS cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 or 40,000 cells per well containing 1 ml of serum-free RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml NGF (Mouse 2.5S NGF, Wako) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h or 24 h. The degree of neurite outgrowth was expressed as the total length of extended neurites per total cells in each field. Expression of LN5 with Unprocessed Laminin α3 Chain in HEK293 Cells—The 190-kDa, precursor α3 chain of LN5 is almost completely cleaved to the 160-kDa mature form immediately after secretion in many LN5-producing cells. To prepare the LN5 with the 190-kDa α3 chain, we expressed a processing-resistant, mutated α3 chain in β3/γ2-HEK cells, which had previously been transfected with the cDNAs of human laminin β3 and γ2 chains (28Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cleavage of the α3 chain by an endogenous proteinase occurs at the Gln1337-Asp1338 bond in the spacer region between the LG3 and LG4 domains, releasing the LG4–5 domain (Fig. 1A) (23Tsubota Y. Mizushima H. Hirosaki T. Higashi S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Gln-Asp sequence is commonly found at the corresponding site of LN5 in human, mouse, and rat. To prevent the proteolytic cleavage, we converted these two amino acid residues to alanine by the site-directed mutagenesis of the α3 chain cDNA (Fig. 1B). The mutated α3 cDNA (α3/AA) was transfected into β3/γ2-HEK cells. An HEK transfectant clone, which expressed all the three chains at high levels as the LN5 heterotrimer, named LN5AA-HEK, was selected. Processing of α3 Chain in Two HEK Transfectants—The recombinant LN5 produced by LN5AA-HEK cells was compared with that produced by LN5-HEK cells, which had been transfected with the cDNAs of the wild-type α3, β3, and γ2 chains (28Kariya Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Nakashima Y. Hirosaki T. Ogawa T. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When analyzed by immunoblotting, the conditioned medium of LN5-HEK cells contained the 160-kDa, processed α3 chain with a trace of 140-kDa α3 chain but not the 190-kDa form at all (Fig. 2A). The 140-kDa α3 chain is produced by a proteolytic cleavage within the NH2-terminal, domain IIIa of the native chain (3Kariya Y. Yasuda C. Nakashima Y. Ishida K. Tsubota Y. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24774-24784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the conditioned medium of LN5AA-HEK cells contained the 160-kDa α3 chain as a major band with a smaller amount of the 190-kDa α3 chain. This showed that the amino acid substitution could not sufficiently prevent the proteolytic processing. We also analyzed LN5 deposited on ECM by the two HEK transfectants. The ECM of LN5-HEK cells, like their conditioned medium, did not contain the 190-kDa α3 chain (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the ECM of LN5AA-HEK cells contained the 190-kDa, precursor α3 chain. The relative amount of the 190-kDa α3 chain was higher than that of the 160-kDa form. These results indicated that LN5AA-HEK cells expressed the precursor LN5 with the 190-kDa α3 chain, which was efficiently deposited on the ECM. Recent studies have suggested that metalloproteinases of the BMP-1/mTLD family, which specifically recognize Asp at the P1′ site, are responsible for the processing of the laminin α3 and γ2 chains (18Amano S. Scott I.C. Takahara K. Koch M. Gerecke D.R. Keene D.R. Hudson D.L. Nishiyama T. Lee S. Greenspan D.S. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22728-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To determine the cleavage site in the mutated α3 chain α3/AA, we purified the LG4–5 fragments from the serum-free conditioned media of LN5AA-HEK and LN5-HEK cells, and analyzed their NH2-terminal amino acid sequences. The yield of the purified LG4–5 from LN5AA-HEK cells was about one-third that of LN5-HEK cells:1.5 μg/liter for LN5AA-HEK versus 4.5 μg/liter for LN5-HEK. The NH2-terminal sequence of the LG4–5 derived from LN5-HEK cells started at residue 1338 (Asp), in agreement with our previous result (23Tsubota Y. Mizushima H. Hirosaki T. Higashi S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Table I). Unexpectedly, the NH2-terminal sequence of the mutated LG4–5 derived from LN5AA-HEK also started at residue 1338 (Ala) with the same following sequence as that of the wild-type LG4–5. We could not identify any additiona"
https://openalex.org/W2143462721,"A novel “long chain” toxin BmP09 has been purified and characterized from the venom of the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch. The toxin BmP09 is composed of 66 amino acid residues, including eight cysteines, with a mass of 7721.0 Da. Compared with the B. martensi Karsch AS-1 as a Na+ channel blocker (7704.8 Da), the BmP09 has an exclusive difference in sequence by an oxidative modification at the C terminus. The sulfoxide Met-66 at the C terminus brought the peptide a dramatic switch from a Na+ channel blocker toaK+ channel blocker. Upon probing the targets of the toxin BmP09 on the isolated mouse adrenal medulla chromaffin cells, where a variety of ion channels coexists, we found that the toxin BmP09 specifically blocked large conductance Ca2+- and voltage-dependent K+ channels (BK) but not Na+ channels at a range of 100 nm concentration. This was further confirmed by blocking directly the BK channels encoded with mSlo1 α-subunits in Xenopus oocytes. The half-maximum concentration EC50 of BmP09 was 27 nm, and the Hill coefficient was 1.8. In outside-out patches, the 100 nm BmP09 reduced ∼70% currents of BK channels without affecting the single-channel conductance. In comparison with the “short chain” scorpion peptide toxins such as Charybdotoxin, the toxin BmP09 behaves much better in specificity and reversibility, and thus it will be a more efficient tool for studying BK channels. A three-dimensional simulation between a BmP09 toxin and an mSlo channel shows that the Lys-41 in BmP09 lies at the center of the interface and plugs into the entrance of the channel pore. The stable binding between the toxin BmP09 and the BK channel is favored by aromatic π -π interactions around the center.

Large conductance Ca2+- and voltage-dependent potassium (MaxiK, BK) channels are thought to play a primary role in a link between the membrane potential and the cellular calcium homeostasis. BK channels are very abundant in many tissues from pancreas to smooth muscle to brain (1Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1355-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Natural toxins are among the most potent and important tools for studying the functions and structure of ion channels. Various species such as the sea anemone, snakes, cone snails, spiders, and scorpions possess ion channel toxins in their venom (2Goudet C. Chi C.W. Tytgat J. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 1239-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). κ conotoxin BtX (κ-BtX) coming from the venom of a worm-hunting cone snail enhances the currents of BK (3Fan C.X. Chen X.K. Zhang C. Wang L.X. Duan K.L. He L.L. Cao Y. Liu S.Y. Zhong M.N. Ulens C. Tytgat J. Chen J.S. Chi C.W. Zhou Z. J. Biol.

Another toxin from the medicine herb dehydrosoyasaponin-1 (DHS-1) also increases the BK currents when the α-subunit coexists with its β-subunit (4McManus O.B. Harris G.H. Giangiacomo K.M.

Scorpion venoms are rich sources of fascinating neurotoxins, which bond with high affinity and specificity to various ion channels and thus widely serve as useful tools in probing the protein mapping of ion channels and clarifying the molecular mechanism involved in the signal transmission and channel gating. Some of the peptidyl scorpion toxins such as Charybdotoxin (ChTX), 1The abbreviations used are: ChTX, Charybdotoxin; MACCs, mouse adrenal medulla chromaffin cells; MS, mass spectrometry; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TEA, tetraethylammonium; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; BmK, B. martensi Karsch. Iberiotoxin, and Slotoxin also block the BK currents encoded by both the Slo1 α-subunits and the β-subunits but with a higher EC50 (5Kaczorowski G.J. Knaus H.G. Leonard R.J. McManus O.B. Garcia M.L.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Those toxins have in common very poor reversibility, which makes it difficult to study the functions of BK currents, especially in current clamp experiments, even though this property is often used to identify the existence of β-subunits (7Xia X.M.

Recently, Xu et al. (10Xu C.Q. Brône B. Wicher D. Bozkurt Ö. Lu W.Y. Huys I. Han Y.H. Tytgat J. Van Kerkhove E. Chi C.W. J. Biol.

According to its specific characteristics, BmBKTx1 can be used to identify different subunits involved in BK channels. So far more than 120 peptide modulators of ion channels have been isolated from scorpion venoms. Most of the scorpion toxins blocking K+ channels (KTx) are short peptides (22–43 amino acids residues) with a well conserved three-dimensional structure stabilized by three or four disulfide bridges (11Rodriguez de la Vega R.C. Possani L.D. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch (BmK) has been used as traditional medicine in China for more than 1000 years, especially for treatments in neural diseases such as apoplexy, hemiplegia, and facial paralysis (12Li H.M. Wang D.C. Zeng Z.H. Jin L. Hu R.Q. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 415-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Indeed, over the past decade, more than 70 different peptides, toxins, or homologues have been isolated. Among them, 14 short chain peptides are associated with the K+ channel toxin family; 51 long chain peptides are related to the Na+ channel toxin family, and only one long chain peptide is identified as a blocker of voltage-dependent K+ channels (KV) (2Goudet C. Chi C.W. Tytgat J. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 1239-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In our previous paper (13Wu H.M. Wu G. Huang X.L. Jiang S.K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1999; 71: 1157-1162Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a systematic isolation has been achieved, and 11 short chain peptides have been characterized from the venom of the Chinese scorpion BmK. Solution structures of some short chain scorpion toxins (less than 40 amino acid residues long) have been described previously (14Zhang N. Li M. Chen X. Wang Y. Wu G. Hu G. Wu H. Proteins. 2004; 55: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Zhang N. Chen X. Li M. Cao C. Wang Y. Wu G. Hu G. Wu H.

Here we report on the purification, characterization, and sequence determination of a novel BK potassium channel blocker BmP09, which is composed of a long chain (66 amino acid residues long) with four disulfide bridges. By assaying the effects of BmP09 on voltage-gated channels in MACCs and on BK channels (mSlo) expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we found that BmP09 was a better specific blocker of BK channels encoded by mSlo α-subunits with perfect reversibility; in other words, it only took less than 5 s for a full recovery. Compared with the Charybdotoxin (ChTX), the superior selectivity and reversibility makes BmP09 a better tool for the structural and functional studies on BK channels. Crude venom was collected by electrical stimulation of the telson of scorpion BmK bred in captivity in Henan Province, China. The peptide was purified as described previously (13Wu H.M. Wu G. Huang X.L. Jiang S.K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1999; 71: 1157-1162Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Lyophilized crude venom was dissolved in NH4HCO3 buffer (50 mm, pH 8.5) and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Sephadex G-50 column (2.5 × 150 cm, Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated and eluted with the same buffer (Fig. 1A). Fraction III from the Sephadex G-50 column was loaded onto a Mono S cation exchange column (HR 5/5, Amersham Biosciences), eluted with a step gradient of solution A to solution B at pH 5.0 (Fig. 1B). Solution A contained NaAc (20 mm), and solution B contained NaAc (20 mm) and NaCl (1 m). It was followed by similar separation on another Sephadex G-50 column (Fig. 1C). The final purification of BmP09 (G3512) was performed by using a reversephase HPLC column (C18 column, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm bead size, Alltech) eluted with a linear gradient from solution C to 50% solution D in solution C at a flow of 1 ml/min. Solution C contained CH3CN (10%) and trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) in H2O, and solution D contained H2O (20%) and trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) in CH3CN (Fig. 1D). The molecular weight of BmP09 was measured using a LCMS-2010A ESI-MS instrument (Shimadazu, Japan). Amino acid analysis was performed on a Beckman 6300 apparatus (Beckman) after hydrolysis of the sample in HCl (6 m) under vacuum at 110 °C for 18 h. The N-terminal sequence of BmP09 was achieved by Edman degradation using a Beckman LF3200 protein-peptide sequencer. Because of the existence of disulfide bonds in the sequence, the sample of BmP09 was subjected to dithiothreitol reduction and iodoacetamide derivatization before MS analysis. Peptide BmP09 was reduced with a 250-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol in 0.25 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 4 mm EDTA. Reduction was carried out in the dark under nitrogen at 37 °C for 1 h. Free thiols were alkylated by addition of a 500-fold molar excess of iodoacetamide held at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The sample was load onto a 10% Tris-Tricine gel for SDS-PAGE to remove reagents. Peptide mapping study was performed on S-alkylated BmP09 as the l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin took place in situ in the gel after electrophoresis. AutoMS-Fit automation software was used to analyze the masses of peptide fragments obtained by digestion. A sample of BmP09 (100 μl, 50 ng/μl) was digested with carboxypeptidase P and Y (Sigma, 0.2 ng/μl, enzyme/substrate ratio was 1:500, w/w) in aqueous solution at 25 °C. Every 6.0-μl digested sample was taken out at 20, 40, and 60 s, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 min, and 2 and 4 h after the onset of incubation, and each aliquot was acidified with 1% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized immediately. Each lyophilized sample was mixed at the ratio of 1:1 with a 4 mg/ml solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CH3OH:H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and performed by a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS spectrum using a Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems) operated in the reflection mode with time lag focusing. Chromaffin Cell Preparation—Based on several early studies (17Neely A. Lingle C.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 453: 97-131Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2448-2465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), MACCs were isolated and maintained as described previously. To compare the effects of BmP09 and BmK AS-1 in the patch clamp experiments, we used rat adrenal chromaffin cells (3Fan C.X. Chen X.K. Zhang C. Wang L.X. Duan K.L. He L.L. Cao Y. Liu S.Y. Zhong M.N.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2844-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dispersion of chromaffin cells was typically done on adrenal medullas from two or three Wistar mice (20–30 g) ∼1 month of age. Cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in a standard CO2 incubator at 37 °C, and currents were recorded 1–5 days after plating. Mutagenesis—Point mutations of mSlo, F266L and F266A, were produced by using QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). In brief, PCRs were performed by using the wild-type mSlo as a template and a pair of complementary mutagenesis primers (F266L, 5′-CAGGGGACCCATGGGAAAATCTTCAAAACAACCAGGCACTTAC-3′ and 5′-GTAAGTGCCTGGTTGTTTTGAAGATTTTCCCATGGGTCCCCTG-3′; F266A, 5′-CAGGGGACCCATGGGAAAATGCTCAAAACAACCAGGCACTTACG-3′ and 5′-CGTAAGTGCCTGGTTGTTTTGAGCATTTTCCCATGGGTCCCCTG-3′). The PCR mixture was then cut with the enzyme DpnI to digest the template wild-type mSlo. After DpnI digestion, the PCR product was transformed into competent bacterial cells to amplify the mutant plasmid of mSlo. Both mutant constructs were verified by sequencing. Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Methods of expression in stage V–VI Xenopus oocytes were as described previously (7Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were defolliculated by treatment with 2 mg/ml collagenase I (Sigma) in zero calcium ND-96 solution. Between 2 and 24 h after defolliculation, 1–2 ng (mSlo) cRNA (a gift of Dr. Christopher Lingle, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) were injected into Xenopus oocytes using a Drummond Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific Co.). After injection, oocytes were then incubated in ND-96 solution at 18 °C. Currents were recorded 2–7 days after RNA injection. ND-96 solution (pH 7.5) containing the following concentrations (in mm), 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, and 10 H+-HEPES, were supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (only for incubation). Solutions—For MACCs, the normal extracellular solution contained the following (in mm): 150 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 H+-HEPES (pH 7.4) titrated with NaOH. For whole-cell recording, the standard pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 130 potassium glutamine, 30 KCl, 0.1 EGTA, 10 H+-HEPES, 0.05 GTP, and 2 MgATP (pH 7.4). The “high tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA)” solution was the same as the standard bath solution except that the 20 mm NaCl was replaced by 20 mm TEA. The “high Cs+” solution contained the following (in mm): 130 cesium glutamine, 30 CsCl, 0.1 EGTA, 10 H+-HEPES, 0.05 GTP, and 2 MgATP (pH 7.4). To record Na+ currents, the high TEA solution was used as a bath solution, and pipettes were backfilled with high Cs+ solution. For Ca2+ current recording solutions, the bath solution contained the following (in mm): 160 TEA, 5 BaCl2, 10 H+-HEPES, and 0.1 EGTA, with pH adjusted to 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide, and the pipette solution was the high Cs+ solution. For oocytes, during recordings, oocytes were bathed in the solution containing the following (in mm): 160 MeSO3K, 10 H+-HEPES, and 2 MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.0 with MeSO3H. Pipettes were filled with a solution containing the following (in mm): 160 MeSO3K, 10 H+-HEPES, and 5 N-hydroxyethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA) with added Ca2+ to make 10 μm free Ca2+, as defined by the EGTAETC program (E. McCleskey, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR), with the pH adjusted to 7.0. All of the chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Patch Clamp Recording from Single Cells—Patch pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries had resistances of 2–6 megohms when filled with internal solution. An outside-out patch was obtained by excising the patch from a cell in the whole-cell configuration. Experiments were performed and recorded using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier and PULSE software (HEKA Electronics, Germany). Currents were typically digitized at 20 kHz. Macroscopic records were filtered at 2.9 kHz during digitization. Single-channel records were filtered at 10 kHz. During recording, drugs and control/wash solutions were puffed locally onto the cell via a puffer pipette containing seven solution channels. The tip (300 μm diameter) of the puffer pipette was located about 120 μm from the cell. As determined by the conductance tests, the solution around a cell under study was fully controlled by the application solution with a flow rate of 100 μl/min or greater. All pharmacological experiments met this criterion. All these experiments were done at room temperature (22–25 °C). Data were analyzed with IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), Clampfit (Axon Instruments, Inc.), SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc.), and QUB (State University of New York, Buffalo) software. Unless stated otherwise, the data are presented as means ± S.E.; significance was tested by Student's t test, and differences in the mean values were considered significant at a probability of ≤0.05. Dose-response curve for the percent block of BK currents was drawn according to the Hill equation I = Im/(1 + ([toxin]/EC50)n), where Im is maximum blocking percentage of BK currents, and [toxin] is the concentration of BmP09. EC50 and n denote the toxin concentration of half-maximal effect and the Hill coefficient, respectively. The model of BK channel (20Morita T. Hanaoka K. Morales M.M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F615-F624PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by homology modeling on the basis of the crystal structure of the bacterial KcsA channel (Protein Data Bank code 1BL8) (21Doyle D.A. Morais C.J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar), using the software SYBYL6.3 (Tripos Associates). The sequence alignment between KcsA and BK channel was obtained using the same criteria as those described by Gao and Garcia (22Gao Y.D. Garcia M.L. Proteins. 2003; 52: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The homology model of BK channel was further subjected to Powell minimization (2000 steps) using Kollman force field. The models of toxin BmP09 and BmK AS-1 (23Lan Z.D. Dai L. Zhuo X.L. Feng J.C. Xu K. Chi C.W. Toxicon. 1999; 37: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were generated by homology modeling on the basis of the crystal structure of the toxin neurotoxin 2 (Protein Data Bank code 1JZB) (24Cook W.J. Zell A. Watt D.D. Ealick S.E. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment between them is described in Fig. 3. The homology models of toxins BmP09 and BmK AS-1 were further subjected to energy minimization and dynamic simulation. The surface electrostatic distribution analysis indicated that BmP09 preferred association with the entryway of the K+ channel by using the positively charged patch with the side chain of Lys-41 in the center. The program “O” (version 8.0.6) (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) was used for the docking experiment. BmP09 was docked manually into the outer entryway of the BK channel model along with the dipole direction. As expected, the mouth of the K+ channel bears a large negative charge, whereas the surface of the toxin BmP09 has a positive charge. The electrostatic potential between the toxin BmP09 and the K+ channel attracted the positively charged toxin to the entryway of the channel. In order to obtain favorable toxinchannel clusters, the toxin molecule was allowed to rotate during the docking process. The most stable cluster with the best fit between the toxin and the K+ channel was used to analyze the contacts between the BmP09 and the BK channel. The BmP09-BK channel cluster docked most favorably was further subjected to energy minimization for 2000 steps to achieve the gradient tolerance 0.05 kcal/(mol Å) using the Powell algorithm and the Kollman force field in the software SYBYL6.3. Molecular dynamics simulation using the Powell algorithm was then carried out for the complex for 100 fs at 300 K. Kollman force field constraints were applied on the backbones of the channel in the region comprising residues His-254 to Val-0278, whereas the remaining part of the channel was kept fixed during the simulation. The structure of the peptide was completely unconstrained. A cut-off distance of 8 Å was used for nonbounded interactions. An integration time step of 0.1 fs was used, and coordinate sets of the trajectory were saved every 2 fs. Every structure obtained from the coordinate sets over the 100 fs of simulation was performed with 500 steps of minimization. Finally, the average structure was energy-minimized with 1000 steps of Powell minimization. Purification of BmP09 —The crude venom was initially separated into four fractions (I–IV) by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 column (Fig. 1A). Separation of the fraction III on a Mono S cation exchange column gave five fractions (Fig. 1B). Among the five fractions, fraction 5 was further separated on another Sephadex G-50 column, and two sub-fractions 351 and 353 were obtained (Fig. 1C). A pure peptide was obtained after the separation of fraction 351 on a reverse-phase HPLC column (Fig. 1D). Primary Sequence of BmP09 —The molecular weight of BmP09 was 7721 Da, as determined by ESI-MS (Fig. 1E). The results of the amino acid analysis (Table I), the N-terminal 14-residue sequence analysis (DNGYLLNKYTGCKI), and peptide mapping studies (Fig. 2) are consistent with those calculated from the mature peptide BmK AS-1 derived from cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF079061). The difference in molecular weight between the ESI-MS data (7721 Da) and calculated value (7704.8 Da) according to the sequence of BmK AS-1 could be attributed to the oxidation of the C-terminal Met residue (26Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The oxidative modification could be validated by the MS analysis of the carboxypeptidase-digested products. Actually, a principal ion with the MS value of 7575 Da was observed under the molecular ion in the MS spectrum of the carboxypeptidase-digested products. The mass difference (147 Da) is well accounted for a Met residue with a sulfoxide group. Therefore, the sequence of BmP09 is the same to that of BmK AS-1, and only differs at the C terminus by an oxidative modification (see Fig. 3).Table IThe amino acid compositions of BmP09Amino acidNo. residuesAsx8.77 (9)Thr1.87 (2)Ser2.06 (3)Glx5.57 (5)Gly5.93 (6)Ala3.06 (3)Val1.56 (1)Met0.85 (1)Ile1.98 (2)Leu5.02 (5)Tyr5.37 (7)Phe1.35 (1)Arg2.04 (2)Lys6.57 (7)Pro1Trp3Cys-Cys3.17 (4)Mh (calculated)7704.81Mh (experimental)7721 Open table in a new tab Effects of BmP09 on Voltage-gated Channels in Chromaffin Cells—MACCs are excitable cells and express variety of voltage-gated channels such as voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels. They are widely used as a neuronal model for studying the features of channel behaviors and searching the targets of toxins (27Zhou Z. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 469: 245-273Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 28Zhou Z. Misler S. J. Biol.

Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 453: 133-166Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To study whether the BmP09 affects voltagegated ion channels, we started to screen for its effects on the MACCs. As shown in Fig. 4A, whole-cell currents were elicited by 60-ms voltage ramps from –90 to +100 mV within the normal extracellular solution in the presence and absence of 100 nm BmP09. With the augmentation of the membrane potential by the voltage ramp, inward currents of Na+ and Ca2+ channels first emerged at ∼0 mV, and the outward currents of voltage-gated K+ channels, including both the KV and the KCa channels, started to increase gradually (28Zhou Z. Misler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3498-3505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Neely A. Lingle C.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 453: 133-166Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4A, the dark trace shows a 67% reduction of outward maximum currents, by the application of 100 nm BmP09, with a slight increase in inward currents. The reduction of outward currents may result in the slight increase of inward currents. In addition, after removal of BmP09, the current trace indicated in Fig. 4A is almost back to the control level, which hints that the blocking behavior of BmP09 is reversible. Voltage-gated sodium channels play a critical role in the repeated firing of action potentials and propagation in excitable cells (2Goudet C. Chi C.W. Tytgat J. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 1239-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Most of the long chain peptides have been proved to be the blockers of Na+ channels such as BmK AS-1 (32Tan Z.Y. Mao X. Xiao H. Zhao Z.Q. Ji Y.H. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the traces in Fig. 4B, activated by voltage steps to 0 mV after a prepulse to –90 mV to remove inactivation, are overlaid to emphasize that there is no inhibition on Na+ channels before, during, and after the application of the toxin 100 nm BmP09. In contrast, BmK AS-1 has an inhibitive effect on the Na+ channel in chromaffin cells (32Tan Z.Y. Mao X. Xiao H. Zhao Z.Q. Ji Y.H. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) but no effect on the K+ currents (n = 5, data not shown). In chromaffin cells, most types of calcium channels exist, and the L-type calcium channel is clustered with the BK channels (33Prakriya M. Lingle C.J. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 2267-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). There were three possibilities for the inhibition of BmP09 on outward K+ currents. The first possibility was directly blocking on Ca2+-activated K+ currents; the second possibility was directly blocking K +V channels; and the third possibility was indirectly blocking on the Ca2+ channels. Therefore, we intended to verify whether BmP09 blocked voltage-gated calcium channels first. In Fig. 4C, Ca2+ currents were elicited by 200 ms of depolarization from a holding potential –70 mV to 0 mV. Three traces of Ca2+ currents are nearly at the same level for 0, 100, and 0 nm BmP09, which suggests that BmP09 has negligible effects on the inward Ca2+ currents. This result also hinted that the BmP09 blocked K +V/BK channels. Selectivity of BmP09 among K+Channels—K+-selective channels with a tremendous diversity are found in probably all the cells. K+ channels, when they are open, set the resting potential, keep fast action potential short, etc. (34Yellen G. Nature. 2002; 419: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). However, we often do not know which types are present in cells, e.g. in MACCs. As we know, there are at least two types of KV channels, i.e. a delayed-rectified channel and an A-type transient channel, and two types of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (KCa) in MACCs, i.e. a small conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ channel (SK) and a BK channel. It is hard to distinguish their individual types in MACCs, but it is easy to separate KV and KCa channels by applications with alternating calcium concentration in the bath solution. In the Fig. 5, A and B, all traces were activated by 100 ms of depolarization to +80 mV from a holding potential of –70 mV, which was designed to avoid the calcium influx induced by the opening of calcium channels at ∼0 mV. In Fig. 5A, 100 nm BmP09 obviously blocked the “KV” currents within the normal bath solution, i.e. 1.8 mm Ca2+ in the normal saline. But as applied with Ca2+-"

The 2.0- and 3.15-Å resolution crystal structures of the binary complex between human DPPIV and nonapeptide Tat-(1–9) and the ternary complex between the variant MWPVDPNIE, called Trp2-Tat-(1–9), and DPPIV bound to adenosine deaminase show that Tat-(1–9) and Trp2-Tat-(1–9) are located in the active site of DPPIV. The interaction pattern of DPPIV with Trp2-Tat-(1–9) is tighter than that with Tat-(1–9), in agreement with inhibition constants (Ki) of 2 × 10–6 and 250 × 10–6 m, respectively. Both peptides cannot be cleaved by DPPIV because the binding pockets of the N-terminal 2 residues are interchanged compared with natural substrates: the N-terminal methionine occupies the hydrophobic S1 pocket of DPPIV that normally accounts for substrate specificity by binding the penultimate residue. Because the N-terminal sequence of the thromboxane A2 receptor resembles the Trp2-Tat-(1–9) peptide, a possible interaction with DPPIV is postulated.

HIV-1-infected cells release Tat into extracellular space, where Tat suppresses antigen- and mitogen-induced activation of human T cells. Full-length Tat inhibits DPPIV with high affinity (Ki = 0.02–11 nm) (16Gutheil W.G. Subramanyam M. Flentke G.R. Sanford D.G. Munoz E. Huber B.T. Bachovchin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and full-length Tat protein that was N-terminally modified with rhodamine lacks any inhibitory potential. Much improved inhibition was observed with a peptide analogue of Tat-(1–9) featuring Trp in the second position, Trp2-Tat-(1–9), with a Ki of 2 μm (18Lorey S. Stockel-Maschek A. Faust J. Brandt W.

Interestingly, the N-terminal sequence Met-Trp-Pro is found in the G-protein-coupled thromboxane A2 receptor located on the surface of monocytes known as antigen-presenting cells. Because monocytes interact strongly with T cells carrying DPPIV, it was suggested that, similar to Tat protein, an interaction between the N terminus of thromboxane A2 receptor and DPPIV might modulate T-cell activation by inhibiting DPPIV proteolytic activity (19Wrenger S.

The DPPIV monomer is composed of a 6-residue-long N-terminal cytoplasmic tail followed by a 22-residue-long transmembrane α-helix, and the extracellular ectodomain is divided into an eight-bladed β-propeller domain (Arg54-Asn497) and a C-terminal α/β-hydrolase domain (Gln508-Pro766) harboring the catalytic triad (Asp708, His740, and Ser630) that is required for peptidase activity. DPPIV binds specifically to adenosine deaminase (23Gorrell M.D. Gysbers V. McCaughan G.W. Scand. J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 25Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B.

Recently, we determined the structure of the complex between human DPPIV (hDPPIV) and bovine adenosine deaminase (bADA) at 3.0-Å resolution (28Weihofen W.A. Liu J. Reutter W. Saenger W. Fan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43330-43335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and 22-Å resolution (29Ludwig K. Fan H. Dobers J. Berger M. Reutter W. Bottcher C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the complex with [hDPPIV·bADA]2 stoichiometry, the active sites of hDPPIV and bADA are fully accessible for substrates, and in hDPPIV, the possible alternative paths of substrate through the central tunnel of the β-propeller or through the side opening to the active site of hDPPIV are not blocked by bound bADA (Fig. 1). We report here the three-dimensional structures of complexes formed between hDPPIV and Tat-(1–9) with sequence MDPVDPNIE and between [hDPPIV·bADA]2 and the nonapeptide MWPVDPNIE that differs from Tat-(1–9) only in the replacement D2W, referred to henceforth as Trp2-Tat-(1–9). Our intention was to elucidate the binding site of these peptides and reveal their mechanism of DPPIV inhibition. Enzyme Purification—Full-length human DPPIV was produced and purified as described previously (30Dobers J. Zimmermann-Kordmann M. Leddermann M. Schewe T. Reutter W. Fan H. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because the N-terminal 28 residues were uniformly truncated during purification as confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, hDPPIV was soluble and further purified by gel filtration on Superdex200 using buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. Peptide Synthesis—Tat-(1–9) with sequence MDPVDPNIE and Trp2-Tat-(1–9) (MWPVDPNIE) were custom synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography purified by Dr. Volkmar Engert (Charité Berlin, Germany). Crystallization of Tat-(1–9)·hDPPIV—hDPPIV was concentrated to 5 mg/ml and crystallized by sparse matrix screening (Hampton Research) in sitting drop wells. Small crystals grew in conditions containing PEG 3350 and PEG 4000, but just a single crystal of hDPPIV grew to a size suitable for x-ray analysis from reservoir solution containing 20% PEG 3350, 100 mm KCl, and 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5. This crystal was soaked for 2 h in reservoir solution supplemented with 1 mm Tat-(1–9) and 20% glycerol for cryo-cooling. Crystallization of Trp2-Tat-(1–9)·hDPPIV·bADA—hDPPIV·bADA was produced and purified as described previously (30Dobers J. Zimmermann-Kordmann M. Leddermann M. Schewe T. Reutter W. Fan H. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and crystallized with microseeding from a reservoir solution containing 20–22% PEG 3350, 200 mm NaCl, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (28Weihofen W.A. Liu J. Reutter W. Saenger W. Fan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43330-43335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Crystals were incubated for 2 h in reservoir solution containing Trp2-Tat-(1–9) peptide at 100 μm concentration. Subsequently, crystals were soaked in 25% PEG 3350, 200 mm NaCl, and 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with 20% glycerol and cryo-cooled. X-ray diffraction power and quality of these crystals were improved by annealing crystals to room temperature two times for 3 s. Structure Determination—X-ray data were collected at beamline ID14-2, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) (see Table I). Because the crystals of the Tat-(1–9) and Trp2-Tat-(1–9) complexes were isomorphous to (hDPPIV)2 with one dimer in the asymmetric unit (Protein Data Bank code 1N1M) and [hDPPIV·bADA]2 (Protein Data Bank code 1W1I) with two heterotetramers in the asymmetric unit, respectively, the initial structures used glycoside-depleted hDPPIV and were adjusted for small packing differences by rigid body refinements with the program REFMAC5.Table ICrystallographic data and refinement statisticsTat-(1-9)·DPPIVTrp2-Tat-(1-9)·DPPIV·ADASpace groupP212121C2Unit cell constants (Å)a = 158.1, b = 168.5, c = 238a = 158.1, b = 168.5, c = 238.8, β = 100.5°Resolution range (Å)30.0 to 2.030.0 to 3.15No. of observations548,144243,240No. of unique reflections128,89897,782Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses refer to the outer resolution shell.92.2 (87.7)89.3 (85.9)〈I/σ(I)〉aValues in parentheses refer to the outer resolution shell.19.8 (3.1)9.1 (2.6)Rsym (%)aValues in parentheses refer to the outer resolution shell.,bRsym = (Σ|Ihkl — 〈I〉|)/(Σ Ihkl), where Ihkl is the observed intensity, and 〈I〉 is the average intensity obtained from multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.6.8 (37)10.6 (41)Refinement statisticsNo. of residues/atoms1,538/14,4544,440/35,904Rwork16.022.4Rfree20.324.6Root mean square deviationscComputed with PROCHECK.Bond lengths (Å)0.0120.01Bond angles (o)1.51.5a Values in parentheses refer to the outer resolution shell.b Rsym = (Σ|Ihkl — 〈I〉|)/(Σ Ihkl), where Ihkl is the observed intensity, and 〈I〉 is the average intensity obtained from multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.c Computed with PROCHECK. Open table in a new tab The crystal structures were determined by difference Fourier techniques. The (Fo – Fc) electron density maps showed the bound peptides Tat-(1–9) and Trp2-Tat-(1–9) in the active sites of DPPIV. The three N-terminal residues of Tat-(1–9) and glycosides bound to each DPPIV, but not the remaining 6 residues of Tat-(1–9), could be modeled manually into the electron density. Similarly, for Trp2-Tat-(1–9), only the 6 N-terminal residues and the sugars could be modeled. Subsequent restrained refinement applied 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry to the protein chains throughout in [Tat-(1–9)·hDPPIV]2 and 4-fold (two times 2-fold) non-crystallographic symmetry in [Trp2-Tat-(1–9)·hDPPIV·bADA]2, but the peptides were refined independently. Further TLS refinement implemented in REFMAC5 yielded the R and Rfree values provided in Table I together with other refinement statistics. Figures of molecules were prepared with MOLSCRIPT (32Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (33Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 2BGR and 2BGN for Tat-(1–9)·DPPIV and Trp2-Tat-(1–9)·hDPPIV·bADA, respectively. Overall Structure of [Trp2-Tat-(1–9)·hDPPIV·bADA]2—Because crystals of [hDPPIV·bADA]2 were incubated with Trp2-Tat-(1–9), the stoichiometry was maintained, and neither hDPPIV nor bADA suffered significant structural changes upon binding of the peptide, as shown by a root mean square deviation of 0.3 Å between protein backbone positions of the complex with the peptide and of free [hDPPIV·bADA]2. The crystal asymmetric unit contains two structurally isomorphous complexes [Trp2-Tat-(1–9)·hDPPIV·bADA]2. Each hDPPIV binds one bADA at the periphery of the β-propeller domain (Fig. 1), and one Trp2-Tat-(1–9) is located in the active site of DPPIV between the α/β-hydrolase domain and the β-propeller domain. The N-terminal 4 residues of Trp2-Tat-(1–9) are clearly defined in the electron density and permitted unambiguous modeling of this part of the peptide. They form intermolecular interactions with DPPIV as shown in Figs. 2A and 3 that are of van der Waals type. In addition, the N-terminal ammonium group forms salt bridges to Glu205 and Glu206 carboxylates and a hydrogen bond to Tyr662Oη, and the Trp2 indole Nϵ hydrogen bonds to Glu206O. The main chains of Asp5-Pro6 are also well defined in the electron density, but only poor density is observed for the side chains because they do not form contacts to DPPIV. These side chains were consequently placed with the most likely conformation determined by NMR spectroscopy of peptide Trp2-Tat-(1–9) in aqueous solution, which indicated that the main chain conformation of this nonapeptide is determined by Pro3 (17Wrenger S.

It is notable that the conformation of Trp2-Tat-(1–9) in the NMR study is comparable to that found here for the N-terminal 6 residues of Trp2-Tat-(1–9). The C-terminal 3 residues of Trp2-Tat-(1–9) are not seen in the electron density due to solvent exposure and possible disorder.Fig. 3Stereo representation of surface area around the active site of hDPPIV with the backbone of bound six N-terminal residues MWPVDP of Trp2-Tat-(1–9) shown in green; the remaining 3 residues are not seen in the electron density.

Upon binding to the active site, 850 Å2 of surface area are buried for each peptide. A second binding site for the inhibitor or a binding site outside the active center as suggested from kinetic studies for full-length Tat protein (16Gutheil W.G. Subramanyam M. Flentke G.R.

Overall Structure of [Tat-(1–9)·hDPPIV]2—The 2.0-Å resolution crystal structure of hDPPIV complexed with Tat-(1–9) was refined to R and Rfree values of 16.0 and 20.3%, respectively (Table I). The asymmetric unit contains one homodimeric [Tat-(1–9)·hDPPIV]2 with comparable geometry as shown in Fig. 1 (with bADA omitted). An Fo – Fc electron density peak above 10.0 σ in the active site of hDPPIV served as a landmark to place the sulfur of the N-terminal methionine side chain containing the only sulfur atom in Tat-(1–9). Given the position of the methionine side chain, the N terminus of Tat-(1–9) could be modeled. The N-terminal ammonium group forms salt bridges and a hydrogen bond similar to that described for hDPPIV bound to Trp2-Tat-(1–9) and to the substrate Ile-Pro-Ile (21Thoma R. Loffler B. Stihle M. Huber W. Ruf A. Hennig M. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), see Fig. 2, A, C, and E. Difference in electron density allowed unambiguous modeling of the conformation of Asp2 of Tat-(1–9). Only sparse density was observed for the main chain of Pro3 (Fig. 2C), and the rest of the peptide lacks any difference electron density and could not be modeled. This is surprising in comparison to crystal structures of hDPPIV in complex with Trp2-Tat-(1–9) presented above and with neuropeptide Y (24Aertgeerts K. Ye S. Tennant M.G. Kraus M.L. Rogers J. Sang B.C. Skene R.J. Webb D.R. Prasad G.S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) because both structures show electron density for at least 6 residues in the active site. The peptides in each half site of the DPPIV dimer were independently refined. Their backbones show comparable conformations and superimpose with root mean square deviations of about 0.5 Å. Upon binding to the active site, 600 Å2 of surface area are buried for each peptide. As noticed for Trp2-Tat-(1–9) (see above) a second binding site for the inhibitor or a binding site outside the active site was not observed. Substrate Access to the Binding Site—As shown by crystal structures of DPPIV in complex with different inhibitors (20Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct.

Immunol. 2001; 54: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and by the complex of DPPIV and a decapeptide substrate (24Aertgeerts K. Ye S. Tennant M.G. Kraus M.L. Rogers J. Sang B.C. Skene R.J. Webb D.R. Prasad G.S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), there are two possible entrances for substrates to the active site of DPPIV. The two routes are both fully accessible in the complex [hDPPIV·bADA]2 as shown in the present study and in our earlier study (28Weihofen W.A. Liu J. Reutter W. Saenger W. Fan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43330-43335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The side opening formed between the β-propeller domain and the α/β-hydrolase domain and the central tunnel of the eight-bladed β-propeller domain measures 20 and 15 Å in diameter, respectively. The bound Trp2-Tat-(1–9) points with the N terminus to the active site of hDPPIV and with the C terminus pointing to the side opening, suggesting that this is the entrance to the active site utilized by the peptide (Fig. 1). Tat-(1–9) and Trp2-Tat-(1–9) Do Not Adopt the Same Conformation as a Substrate in the Active Site of DPPIV—As serine exopeptidase, DPPIV cleaves the N-terminal dipeptide of substrates with Pro or Ala in the penultimate position called P1 in the protease nomenclature introduced by Berger and Schechter (1Berger A. Schechter I. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1970; 257: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), see Scheme 1. Substrate specificity is associated with the narrow hydrophobic pocket S1 (Fig. 2E) that accommodates the side chain of residue P1 of a substrate and restricts possible residues fitting to this pocket in DPPIV to be unpolar and as large or smaller than Pro, consequently also allowing for Ala, as actually observed for the Pro2/Ala2 dimorphism of DPPIV substrates. The side chain of the upstream N-terminal residue P2 points to the large cavity S2 that gives rise to low specificity of DPPIV for this position. The catalytically active Ser630 attacks the scissile carbonyl group between P1 and P1′ to from a tetrahedral intermediate as observed in the structures of DPPIV in complex with two peptide inhibitors, the tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ile (Fig. 2E) (21Thoma R. Loffler B. Stihle M. Huber W. Ruf A. Hennig M. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal decapeptide of neuropeptide Y (24Aertgeerts K. Ye S. Tennant M.G. Kraus M.L. Rogers J. Sang B.C. Skene R.J. Webb D.R. Prasad G.S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Compared with a natural substrate, Trp2-Tat-(1–9) exhibits a different backbone conformation when bound to the active site of DPPIV. Except for the N-terminal ammonium group that is anchored to the active site in the same way as found for natural substrates, the side chains of P1 and P2 interchange their supposed binding pockets, with P1 binding to S2 and P2 binding to S1 (Scheme 1; Fig. 2, A, B, and E). The side chain of Met1 (P2) mimics the conformation of proline in the P1 position of a feasible substrate and fills pocket S1, which is supposed to assure substrate specificity and is lined by Ser630, Tyr631, Val656, Tyr662, and Tyr666 (Fig. 2, A and B). The subsequent Trp2 of Trp2-Tat-(1–9) points to and is located in cavity S2, which is supposed to nonspecifically accommodate the side chain of P2. The bulky indole group of Trp2 (P1) forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Glu206 and packs against Arg125, Phe357, and Tyr547 (Fig. 2, A and B). The side chain arrangements of Met1 and Trp2 force the backbone of Trp2-Tat-(1–9) into a conformation that shows the peptide plane of the scissile bond (Trp2-Pro3) rotated by 120° so that the carbonyl carbon of Trp2 is displaced from Ser630Oγ by 5 Å, and this geometry prevents formation of a tetrahedral intermediate and turnover (see Figs. 2, A and B, and 3; compare with Fig. 2E). Pro3 in position P1′ and Val4 in position P2′ form hydrophobic interactions with Tyr547 and Trp629, respectively (Figs. 2, A and B, and 3). Asp5 (P3′) and Pro6 (P4′) could be located from the electron density but are more than ∼4 Å distant to residues of DPPIV so that only the N-terminal 4 residues of the peptide interact tightly with DPPIV. Tat-(1–9) occupies the active site of DPPIV with the N-terminal Met1 (P2) bound to the S1 pocket (Fig. 2, C and D), and the N-terminal ammonium group interacts with the active site as described above for the Trp2-Tat-(1–9) complex. However, the subsequent residues Asp2 and Pro3 adopt a different position and orientation because Asp2 is rotated by ∼180° compared with Trp2 in Trp2-Tat-(1–9) to form a hydrogen bond (Asp2Oδ–Ser630Oγ) to the catalytically active Ser630 and is placed between Ser630 and the scissile bond of the peptide, thereby preventing turnover. Difference electron density only allowed modeling the backbone of Pro3, and no density was observed for the side chain of Pro3 (Fig. 2C) that was modeled based on the geometry of the main chain. In the final model, Pro3 is displaced by >4 Å from any DPPIV residue, and all interactions are restricted to Met1 and Asp2 (Fig. 2, C and D). Considering the less dense interaction pattern of Tat-(1–9) bound to the DPPIV active site and the buried surface area of only 600 Å2 upon complex formation, the reported lower binding affinity (see below) of Tat-(1–9) to the active site of DPPIV relative to Trp2-Tat-(1–9) is in good agreement with our structural data. Structural Data Suggest a Competitive Type of Inhibition Contrasting Kinetic Data—Extensive kinetic studies were performed regarding the inhibition potentials of the original Tat-(1–9) peptide and Tat-(1–9) derivatives on DPPIV activity. Some results of these studies are given in Table II. Depending on the experimental setup, Ki values and type of inhibition were determined for Tat-(1–9)-derived peptides with some of the N-terminal amino acids exchanged. Here we only discuss the results for Tat-(1–9) and Trp2-Tat-(1–9).Table IIKinetic constants of Tat-(1–9)-derived peptides for inhibition of DPPIV, taken from Ref.18Lorey S. Stockel-Maschek A.

They slightly altered Ki, and the type of inhibition changed in some cases to a competitive or parabolic/linear mixed type. Compared with Tat-(1–9), which inhibits DPPIV weakly with a Ki of about 250 μm, the best inhibitor is Trp2-Tat-(1–9) with Ki of 1.9 μm. The types of inhibition observed in these two cases (parabolic mixed and linear mixed, respectively) suggest Tat-(1–9) and Trp2-Tat-(1–9) to be located not only in the active site but also in a noncompetitive binding site on DPPIV that is distant from the active site (18Lorey S.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This contradicts our findings that suggest purely competitive inhibition and demands a new interpretation of the kinetic data. One could argue, however, that we find Tat-(1–9) and Trp2-Tat-(1–9) only in the active site and not in a second site because the complexes were generated by soaking of the [hDPPIV]2 and [hDPPIV·bADA]2 crystals and that crystal packing contacts and binding of ADA to DPPIV had obscured secondary binding sites of the ligands. This, however, can be ruled out because [hDPPIV]2 and [hDPPIV·bADA]2 crystallized in two different crystal forms with different crystal contacts and a second binding site was not observed in either case. Structures Partly Explain the Kinetic Behavior of Single Mutants of Tat-(1–9)—The structural data of Tat-(1–9) and Trp2-Tat-(1–9) bound to the active site of DPPIV suggest a new interpretation of kinetic data determined for Tat-(1–9) and derivatives. For this we presuppose that peptides with inhibitory potential are bound with their N-terminal ammonium group to Glu205 and Glu206 in the active site of DPPIV (see above). On this basis, we propose that peptides comprising a hydrophobic N-terminal residue show the same binding pattern to DPPIV as observed for Tat-(1–9) and Trp2-Tat-(1–9). The hydrophobic side chain would likely replace the Tat-(1–9) methionine side chain in the S1 pocket of DPPIV. This view is supported by a kinetic study showing that the peptides FAPAG, FHPKR, and IKPEA have an inhibitory potential comparable to peptides featuring an N-terminal Met (17Wrenger S. Reinhold D. Hoffmann T. Kraft M. Frank R. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Peptides with Ala, Gly, or Thr in the N-terminal position lacked the ability to inhibit DPPIV and indicated that an N-terminal hydrophobic residue is a prerequisite for a peptide to act as a DPPIV inhibitor. The influence of single amino acid exchanges at position 2 of Tat-(1–9) on the ability to inhibit DPPIV was investigated in another study (35Wrenger S. Reinhold D. Faust J. Mrestani-Klaus C. Brandt W. Fengler A. Neubert K. Ansorge S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 477: 161-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only relative inhibitory potentials were determined, and the ranking of residues with increasing influence on the binding affinity was found to be D < P ≪ S < G < K < F < A ≪ W. Tat-(1–9) comprising Asp2 shows no prominent role, but Ala2 features the second best inhibition potential and suggests that neither extensive hydrophobic contacts nor polar interactions of residue 2 are important determinants for strong DPPIV binding affinity. How much the presence of Pro in position 3 accounts for binding affinity to DPPIV was investigated previously (18Lorey S. Stockel-Maschek A. Faust J. Brandt W. Stiebitz B. Gorrell M.D. Kahne T. Mrestani-Klaus C. Wrenger S. Reinhold D. Ansorge S. Neubert K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results in Table II indicate that the inhibition constant of Trp2-Tat-(1–9) is about 20-fold lower compared with that of Trp2, Ile3-Tat-(1–9). Pro3 stabilizes the conformation of the peptide, which reduces loss of entropy upon binding and results in stronger binding affinity (34Wrenger S. Hoffmann T. Faust J. Mrestani-Klaus C. Brandt W.

Trp2-Tat-(1–9) bound to the active site of DPPIV shows Pro3 stacked with Tyr547, but in the case of Tat-(1–9), no contacts were found between Pro3 and any DPPIV residues (see above). To what extent Pro3 contributes to binding affinity can hardly be derived from our structural data because the two peptides show different backbone conformations. Kinetic studies of Tat-(1–9) peptides with replacements in position 5 or 6 showed similar inhibitory potential compared with wild type Tat-(1–9) (34Wrenger S. Hoffmann T. Faust J. Mrestani-Klaus C.

This is consistent with our structure and the crystal structure of DPPIV in complex with the N-terminal decapeptide of neuropeptide Y (24Aertgeerts K. Ye S. Tennant M.G. Kraus M.L. Rogers J. Sang B.C. Skene R.J. Webb D.R. Prasad G.S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), both showing that substrate recognition does not extend beyond P2′ (Scheme 1). Implications for Tat Binding—Tat protein was reported to bind to DPPIV at physiological salt concentrations without inhibiting the protease activity of DPPIV against small chromogenic substrates used to assay enzymatic activity (16Gutheil W.G. Subramanyam M. Flentke G.R. Sanford D.G. Munoz E. Huber B.T. Bachovchin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6594-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The kinetics of inhibition indicate that the affinity of Tat for DPPIV varies from 20 pm to 11 nm, and the activity of DPPIV varies from 13% to 100% depending on NaCl concentration in the range between 0 and 140 mm. Another study reported that the N-terminal residues of Tat protein are essential for the inhibition of DPPIV-catalyzed degradation of interleukin-2 (1Berger A. Schechter I. Philos. Trans. R Soc.

These observations and the reported low Ki values for wild-type Tat binding in comparison to moderate binding of Tat-(1–9) to DPPIV suggest that the N terminus of Tat is not the only determinant for binding and that other intermolecular interactions might contribute as well. DPPIV has been shown to play a crucial role in T-cell activation and in several functions of the immune system (2De Meester I. Korom S. Van Damme J. Scharpe S. Immunol.

Previous evidence implicated DPPIV in antigen-specific T-cell activation events and Tat protein in suppression of antigen-induced, but not mitogen-induced, T-cell proliferation. In the present work, we show that the N-terminal residues of Tat-(1–9) bind to the active site of DPPIV and provide evidence that Tat-(1–9) might inhibit DPPIV activity. This suggests that the immunosuppressive effect of Tat is mediated, at least partly, by competitive inhibition of DPPIV activity. In addition, the inhibition of DPPIV activity influences the processing of chemokines SDF-1α, SDF-1β, RANTES, and LD78β, thereby modulating their anti-HIV activities.

The purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma vivax (TvNH) fixes the 5′-OH group in a gauche,trans orientation about the C4′–C5′ bond, enabling the 5′-oxygen to accept an intramolecular hydrogen bond from the C8-atom of the purine leaving group.

Inverse 4′-3H and normal 5′-3H kinetic isotope effects are commonly observed, contrary to the non-enzymatic reactions, and have been invoked to account for a strained conformation of the 5′-OH group in the transition state (5Berti P.J. Tanaka K.S.E. Adv. Phys. Org. Chem. 2002; 37: 239-314Google Scholar). However, care must be taken in the interpretation of these kinetic isotope effects because they may be caused by binding rather then catalysis (6Birck M.R. Schramm V.L. J. Am. Chem.

The present study on the purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase (EC 3.2.2.1) of Trypanosoma vivax (TvNH) 1The abbreviations used are: TvNH, Trypanosoma vivax nucleoside hydrolase; NH, nucleoside hydrolase. aims to elucidate the catalytic role of the 5′-OH group, which contributes 5.4 kcal/mol to kcat/Km (1Versées W.

The putative transition state for enzymatic cleavage of N-glycosidic bonds is generally highly dissociative with substantial lengthening of the scissile bond but no bond formation to the incoming nucleophile (5Berti P.J.

In purine nucleosides, departure of the leaving group is facilitated by protonation at N7 prior to reaching the transition state. In the base aspecific 2The term “base aspecific” implies that the enzyme accepts substrates with either a purine or a pyrimidine leaving group. NH of Crithidia fasciculata a histidine residue has been identified as the general acid to accomplish this. However, a remarkable feature of the TvNH enzyme is the apparent lack of an acidic group to protonate the leaving purine. In this enzyme, x-ray crystallography and mutagenic scanning analysis did not reveal a suitable general acid candidate (1Versées W. Decanniere K. Van Holsbeke E. Devroede N. Steyaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15938-15946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rather, a tryptophan (Trp-260) was found to be the only catalytic residue in the vicinity of the purine leaving group. A previous study combining quantum chemical calculations, mutagenesis, and presteady state kinetics revealed that an aromatic stacking interaction between Trp-260 and the purine ring contributes to catalysis by raising the basicity of the latter (8Versées W. Loverix S. Vandemeulebroucke A. Geerlings P. Steyaert J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because enhanced basicity facilitates protonation by solvent, it appears that the TvNH enzyme employs specific, rather than general, acid catalysis. Depurination by TvNH is further catalyzed by interactions with the three hydroxyls of the ribose moiety of the substrate, because the 2′-, 3′-, and 5′-deoxy nucleosides are severely impaired in binding and catalysis (1Versées W. Decanniere K. Van Holsbeke E. Devroede N. Steyaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15938-15946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The inosine bound in the TvNH active site adopts an unusual C4′-endo ribose pucker, with a H2′-C2′-C1′-N9 dihedral angle near 0°. This eclipsed conformation about the C2′–C1′ bond is indicative of ground state destabilization. Interestingly, the C4′-endo pucker is about 2 kcal/mol higher in energy than the C3′-exo pucker adopted in the transition state (9Saenger W. Cantor C.R. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1984: 62Google Scholar). The C4′-endo pucker is stabilized by interactions between the 2′-, 3′-, and 5′-OH groups and the enzyme, which could in part explain the necessity of these groups in catalysis. The 5′-OH is tightly bound in a gauche,trans orientation about the C4′–C5′ bond (see Fig. 1a) via hydrogen bonds to Glu-184 (2.57 Å) and Asn-173 (2.94 Å) (Fig. 2). A similar anchoring of the 5′-OH is observed in the homologous and extensively studied C. fasciculata NH (10Degano M. Almo S.C. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6277-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the latter enzyme as well, the 5′-OH was found to be crucial for catalysis (2Parkin D.W. Horenstein B.A. Abdulah D.R. Estupiñán B. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20658-20665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was suggested that the lone pair electrons of the 5′-oxygen stabilizes the ribo-oxocarbenium transition state electrostatically via a “neighboring group interaction” with O4′ (Fig. 1a, dashed line) (5Berti P.J. Tanaka K.S.E. Adv. Phys. Org. Chem. 2002; 37: 239-314Google Scholar, 10Degano M. Almo S.C. Sacchettini J.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6277-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Such an interaction would imply that the oxonium-like resonance form of the oxocarbenium predominates (Fig. 1b). In the present study, we set out to investigate the catalytic role of the 5′-OH by theoretical and experimental methods.Fig. 2The 5′-OH binding pocket in TvNH.

The 5′-OH Group in TvNH Does Not Contribute to Ribooxocarbenium Ion Stabilization—In all NHs, the 5′-OH group of the ribose moiety of the substrate has been shown to play a prominent role in catalysis (1Versées W.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6277-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), as well as in purine nucleoside phosphorylase (19Fedorov A. Shi W. Kicska G. Fedorov E. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Hanson J.C. Gainsford G.J. Larese J.Z. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), this 5′-OH catalytic effect has been proposed to originate from a stabilization of the ribo-oxocarbenium transition state via an electrostatic neighboring group interaction with the O4′ atom. This proposal was based on crystal structures of the enzymes in complex with substrate analogues or transition state inhibitors (iminoribitols), invariably showing the 5′-OH group firmly anchored in a gauche,trans orientation about the C4′–C5′ bond. This orientation implies a close proximity between the O5′ and O4′ atoms (N4′ atom in iminoribitols). Allegedly, the 5′ lone pair electrons would electrostatically stabilize the developing positive charge on the O4′ atom. To test this hypothesis, we used high level ab initio methods to calculate the charge distribution in the ribo-oxocarbenium ion. The results indicate that the positive charge resides primarily on the C1′ atom, whereas the O4′ atom remains negatively charged, albeit to a lesser extent than in the nucleoside ground state. Thus, although the ribo-oxocarbenium tends toward an oxonium ion (Fig. 1b), the absence of positive charge on O4′ excludes a favorable electrostatic interaction with the O5′ lone pair electrons, undermining the neighboring group hypothesis. To further scrutinize any effects of the 5′-OH group on the stability of the ribo-oxocarbenium ion, we calculated the gas phase energies of three conformers about the C4′–C5′ bond. Apart from the gauche,trans conformation observed in enzyme-bound species, two other staggered conformers exist (Fig. 1a). The gauche,gauche conformer has the 5′-OH positioned over the ribosyl ring, whereas this group is pointing away in the trans,gauche conformer. Energy optimizations of the three conformers for the ribo-oxocarbenium ion show that the trans,gauche and gauche,trans conformers are energetically equal within the uncertainty on the calculated values, 3The trans,gauche conformer of the ribo-oxocarbenium ion was found to be 0.2 kcal/mol more stable than the gauche,trans conformer, whereas the uncertainty on these values is at least 1 kcal/mol. despite the proximity between the O5′ and O4′ atoms in the latter. This observation excludes a stabilizing O5′-O4′ neighboring group interaction. Remarkably, the gauche,gauche ribo-oxocarbenium ion is found to be 5 kcal/mol more stable than the other two conformers, presumably because of the proximity (3.07 Å) between O5′ and the positively charged C1′. It is quite surprising that NHs do not utilize this potential of the 5′-OH to lower the energy of a ribo-oxocarbenium-like transition state, because the gauche,gauche conformer has never been observed. Modulation of Purine Basicity via a C8H–O5′ Hydrogen Bond—Because the catalytic function of the 5′-OH in TvNH cannot be attributed to ribo-oxocarbenium ion stabilization, another mechanism should be envisioned.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15938-15946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it appears that the gauche,trans conformation about the C4′–C5′ bond combined with the anti conformation of the nucleobase about the C1′–N9 bond allows for the formation of a hydrogen bond between C8-H of the purine and the 5′-oxygen (Fig. 2). Because of the low electronegativity of carbon, a CH–O hydrogen bond is a weak interaction and its importance is generally ignored. Yet, ab initio studies have shown that the strength of a CH–O bond may surpass that of a conventional uncharged OH–O hydrogen bond when the donor molecule is positively charged (20Scheiner S. Kar T. Pattanayak J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13257-13264Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It turns out that the carbon atom between the nitrogens in the imidazolium ion is an extremely potent hydrogen bond donor. Inversely, one could argue that the formation of a CH–O hydrogen bond between imidazole and an acceptor molecule should increase the nitrogen basicity of the former. Likewise in TvNH, the 5′-oxygen could promote the protonation of the nucleobase at N7 by preferentially accepting a hydrogen bond from the C8 of a positively charged purine ring. To corroborate this hypothesis, we compared the gas phase N7 proton affinities of C4′-endo puckered purine nucleoside in the trans,gauche (no C8H–O5′ hydrogen bond) and gauche,trans (C8H–O5′ hydrogen bond) conformations. It turns out that upon hydrogen bond formation, the gas phase N7 proton affinity increases by about 5 kcal/mol. The existence of a genuine CH–O hydrogen bond in the calculated protonated species is further supported by a C–O distance of 2.92 Å and a 108 cm–1 red shift of the C8-H stretching frequency upon going from the trans,gauche to the gauche,-trans conformer. To translate the calculated change in proton affinity to changes in the acid dissociation constant (pKa), we calculated proton affinities for a series of amine bases. Plotting these values against their experimental pKa values yields a linear curve with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 (data not shown) that was used to estimate the difference in pKa between the various conformers of purine nucleoside from their calculated proton affinities. Via this approach, an increase in the pKa of purine nucleoside (at N7) by about 1.9 units is found going from the gauche,trans to the trans,gauche conformer. Considering the low pKa range (1Versées W. Decanniere K. Van Holsbeke E. Devroede N. Steyaert J. J. Biol.

Perkin Trans. 2002; 2: 1320-1327Crossref Google Scholar), this pKa shift raises the concentration of the reactive (protonated) species by more than an order of magnitude at physiological pH. These calculations thus imply that the 5′-OH in TvNH could establish a near 100-fold rate enhancement via leaving group activation. A Catalytic Role for the 5′-OH in Leaving Group Activation—To experimentally assess the role of the 5′-OH in leaving group activation in TvNH, a double-substrate engineering approach was employed. The contribution of 5′-OH to catalysis was measured by comparing the kinetic parameters for guanosine and 5′-deoxyguanosine. To filter out the fraction originating from leaving group activation, the kinetic effect of removing the 5′-OH group was also gauged in the presence of an activated leaving group (i.e. comparison of 7-methylguanosine with 5′-deoxy-7-methylguanosine). Similar to protonation, N7-methylation of guanosine induces a positive charge in the purine ring, facilitating leaving group departure. Because TvNH follows a complex mechanism with rate-limiting ribose release (22Vandemeulebroucke A. Versées W. De Vos S. Van Holsbeke E. Steyaert J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12902-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the kinetic analysis was performed on the second order rate constant kcat/Km, which is independent of product release (23Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985: 121-154Google Scholar) (Table I). Removal of the 5′-OH group in guanosine causes a 6,000-fold reduction in kcat/Km (corresponding to 5.4 kcal/mol). However, with 7-methylguanine as a leaving group, removing the 5′-OH group decreases kcat/Km by merely a factor of 50 (corresponding to 2.4 kcal/mol). From the thermodynamic cycle in Fig. 3, it can be deduced that upon removing 5′-OH, a 125-fold reduction in kcat/Km comes from weakened leaving group activation. These results, combined with the ab initio calculations, indicate that the 5′-OH group in TvNH contributes 3.0 kcal/mol to leaving group activation by accepting a hydrogen bond from the C8 of the purine. The remaining part of the 5′-deoxy effect (2.4 kcal/mol) could originate from the impossibility of the enzyme to bind 5′-deoxyribose in a C4′-endo pucker, which would result in impaired ground state destabilization. Truncation of the side chains of Glu-184 and Asn-173, which make up the 5′-OH binding pocket in TvNH (Fig. 2), affects kcat/Km for guanosine by a factor of 20,000 (Table I). This is the same order of magnitude as the 5′-deoxy effect for the wild type enzyme. However, kcat/Km for the substrate 5′-deoxyguanosine is lowered only 40-fold by the mutations. 4The latter rate reduction can be attributed to a structural perturbation of the active site in the N173A/E184A double mutant, as observed in the crystal structure (x-ray data not shown). These structural effects complicate a direct quantitative comparison of the kinetics for the double mutant and the wild type enzyme, but they cancel out in the kinetic coupling between different substrates. The kinetic coupling between the N173A/E184A double mutant and the presence of the 5′-OH group demonstrate that the catalytic function of the latter depends on correct anchoring and/or polarization by Glu-184 and Asn-173. Furthermore, comparison of the kinetic implications of the double mutant for guanosine and 7-methylguanosine confirms that these side chains have a role in leaving group activation via the 5′OH group.Table Ikcat/Km (m-1s-1) for wild type and N173A/E184A TvNHWild typeN173A/E184AGuanosine(1.0 ± 0.2) 10652 ± 87-Methylguanosine(1.7 ± 0.2) 106(1.5 ± 0.3) 1045′-Deoxyguanosine159 ± 204 ± 15′-Deoxy-7-methylguanosine(3.4 ± 0.6) 104(7 ± 3) 103 Open table in a new tab Hydrolysis/phosphorolysis of the N-glycosidic bond in (deoxy-) nucleosides and nucleotides commonly involves the protonation of the leaving nucleobase by a general acid, concomitant with nucleophilic attack. Although TvNH lacks a general acid, it is equally catalytically proficient to nucleoside hydrolases from other sources (17Versées W. Decanniere K. Pelle R. Depoorter J. Brosens E. Parkin D.W. Steyaert J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1363-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that, instead of employing general acid catalysis, TvNH activates the leaving purine base by increasing the N7 basicity (hence favoring its protonation) via a parallel aromatic stacking interaction with the indole side chain of Trp-260 (8Versées W. Loverix S. Vandemeulebroucke A. Geerlings P. Steyaert J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Mignon P. Loverix S. De Proft F. Geerlings P. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2004; 108: 6038-6044Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The high level ab initio calculations presented here rule out a previously presumed stabilizing catalytic interaction between 5′O and 4′O. Rather, they suggest that a crystallographically observed intramolecular C8H–O5′ hydrogen bond in the purine nucleoside increases the basicity of the leaving group. A double-substrate engineering kinetic analysis confirms the computational results and unambiguously implicates the 5′-OH group in leaving group activation, aided by the side chains of Glu-184 and Asn-173."

Despite the discovery of constitutive PDGF-mediated tumorigenesis in human tumors, the steps involved in multistep tumorigenesis because of PDGF signaling are not well understood. We previously derived a cell line (SV7tert) from a human angiomyolipoma through the sequential introduction of SV40 large T cells and telomerase (8.Arbiser J.L. Yeung R. Weiss S.W. Arbiser Z.K. Amin M.B. Cohen C. Frank D. Mahajan S. Herron G.S. Yang J. Onda H. Zhang H.B. Bai X. Uhlmann E. Loehr A. Northrup H. Au P. Davis I. Fisher D.E. Gutmann D.H. Am. J.

Despite the introduction of two oncogenes into these cells, they fail to form tumors in nude mice. One potential reason for this failure is the presence of high levels of PDGF in the kidney but not the skin. Knockouts of PDGF or its receptors lead to severe defects in renal development, and these defects are the major cause of lethality in mice carrying these deficiencies (10.Leveen P. Pekny M. Gebre-Medhin S. Swolin B. Larsson E. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 11.Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In order to explore whether PDGF could cause these cells to become tumorigenic, we introduced constitutive expression of PDGF-BB using retroviral gene transfer into SV7tert cells. Constitutive expression of PDGF-BB led to tumorigenesis in nude mice, with a prolonged latency of several months. This implied that epigenetic factors may play a role in PDGF-mediated tumorigenesis in human cells. Among the changes we observed in PDGF-transduced cells are high levels of reactive oxygen. We have shown previously (12.Govindarajan B. Klafter R. Miller M.S. Mansur C. Mizesko M. Bai X. LaMontagne Jr., K. Arbiser J.L. Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that carcinogenesis due to reactive oxygen results in silencing of the tumor suppressor p16ink4a. Consistent with this, we observed decreased expression of p16ink4a in tumor-derived tissue compared with the original PDGF-overexpressing cell line. The p16ink4a silencing gene Id-1 was highly expressed in tumor-derived tissue. Consistent with this hypothesis, tumorigenesis in vivo was accelerated by introduction of Id-1 into PDGF-expressing SV7tert cells. We observed that in vivo growth selects for cells with a low bioenergetic index (BEC) (Warburg effect). Inhibition of PDGFRβ signaling with the clinically approved inhibitor Glivec resulted in inhibition of some but not all of the changes observed because of constitutive expression of PDGF, implying that PDGF-induced carcinogenesis of human cells results in both reversible and irreversible changes. These irreversible changes may account in part for the failure of tyrosine kinase-based therapies in advanced malignancies. SV7tert cells were infected with retroviruses encoding PDGF-BB or GFP as a vector control according to the method of Schechner and co-workers (13.Enis D.R. Bothwell A.L. Sessa W.C. Pober J.S. Schechner J.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 209Google Scholar). Unselected pooled cells were used for further in vitro and in vivo analyses. PDGF overexpression was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For the analysis of protein expression of VEGF, cells were extracted in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin), and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (14.Chung J.

SV7tert, SV7tert PDGF, SV7tert PDGF-pLXSN, and SV7tert PDGF-Id-1 (1 × 106) cells were injected into the flank of 6-week-old nude male mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories). Three weeks after tumors became visible, they were excised and fixed in formalin for hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 6). Tumor volume was measured using the formula (width2 × length) × 0.52, where width represents the shortest dimension (Fig. 5). Transduction of SV7tert cells with Id-1 in the absence of PDGF did not lead to tumorigenesis over a period of 6 months (data not shown).Fig. 5Introduction of PDGF into SV7tert cells converts them to a tumorigenic phenotype.

The p65(RelA), c-Rel, and RelB NF-κB subunits are fully functional transcriptional activators, whereas the p50 and p52 subunits lack a transcriptional activation domain (for review, see Refs. 12.Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar and 13.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar). NF-κBs function as specific hetero- or homodimers that bind to a GGGRNWTYCC consensus DNA sequence found in the promoters or enhancers of NF-κB target genes (for review, see Refs. 12.Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar and 13.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activating NF-κB subunits are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells in a complex with one of the IκB family proteins, which block their nuclear import and DNA binding activity. A large variety of extracellular activating stimuli induce the proteosomal dependent destruction of IκBs thereby differentially freeing NF-κBs to bind DNA and activate the transcription of their genomic targets (for review, see Ref. 14.Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3437) Google Scholar).

More recently, a distinct class of NF-κB stimuli (exemplified by LTβ, BAFF, and CD40 ligand), which also contribute to the implementation of differentiation programs and the adaptive phase of immune responses, have been shown to function as biphasic activators initially acting via the rapid canonical pathway and subsequently feeding into a delayed noncanonical protein synthesis-dependent route characterized by the activation of RelB/p52 heterodimers (for review, see Refs. 8.Bonizzi G.

Biol. 2003; 23: 8070-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the release of NF-κBs from IκBs is mediated by the cytoplasmic signalsome complex, which consists of two serine-threonine kinases (IKKα, IKKβ) and NEMO/IKKγ, a regulatory/docking protein (for review, see Refs. 1.Karin M.

IKKβ is essential for the phosphorylation of IκBs on a pair of amino-terminal serines (residues 32 and 36 in IκBα) thereby targeting IκB for ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal destruction (for review, see Refs. 1.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4070) Google Scholar, 7.Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang Q.M. Nat. Rev.

Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). In contrast, IKKα is not required for the phosphorylation of IκBs via the canonical NF-κB activation pathway in vivo, with the exception of receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand signaling in mammary epithelial cells (19.Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Rather, IKKα plays an essential role in epidermal keratinocyte differentiation independent of both its kinase activity and NF-κB activation and has also recently been found to play NF-κB-dependent and -independent roles in tooth development (20.Hu Y. Baud V. Oga T. Kim K.I. Yoshida K. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 21.Sil A.K. Maeda S. Sano Y. Roop D.R. Karin M.

Cell. 2004; 6: 219-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). With respect to its physiological role in NF-κB signaling pathways, IKKα is instead essential for the activation of the noncanonical NF-κB activation pathway, which requires neither IKKβ nor NEMO/IKKγ (for review, see Refs. 8.Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar, 15.Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 2002; 10: 693-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In this context, via NF-κB-inducing kinase-dependent signaling, IKKα phosphorylates multiple serines of the p100 precursor of the p52 subunit, thereby inducing its proteosome-dependent processing into mature p52 subunits that are then freed to activate NF-κB target genes as RelB/p52 heterodimers (8.Bonizzi G.

We and other groups have also found that IKKα is required to activate the transcription of canonical NF-κB target genes (25.Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

The latter dependence on IKKα is independent of IκBα destruction and instead appears to involve one or more nuclear targets perhaps including histone H3 (27.Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C.

Cell. 2004; 16: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) resulting in the de-repression of NF-κB target genes. In this report we have investigated the physiological requirement of the kinase activity of IKKα for the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes on a genomic scale in IKKα-null MEFs. Physiological expression of Wt. IKKα in IKKα(-/-) MEFs by retroviral transduction resulted in the rescue of specific NF-κB-dependent genes in the presence and absence of TNFα stimulation. Comparative microarray screens with NF-κB-compromised MEFs (p50(-/-) and Wt. + IκBα(S32A,S36A)) revealed that the large majority of these IKKα-rescued genes are either dependent on basal or TNFα-inducible NF-κB, thus demonstrating that 1) IKKα plays an essential role in controlling the expression of both signal-induced and basal NF-κB-dependent genes, and 2) IKKα does not appear to influence the expression of a large number of genes outside the NF-κB pathway. Comparable physiological rescue with a kinase-dead IKKα mutant protein (IKKα(K44M)) showed that most of these genes are dependent on IKKα kinase activity for their stimulus-dependent and -independent expression. However, the expression of up to 28% of these NF-κB-dependent genes was also surprisingly rescued by the kinase-inactive IKKα(K44M) mutant. Furthermore both wild type and mutant IKKα are also required for the basal levels of expression of specific NF-κB-dependent genes. Thus, our findings collectively reveal that the levels of expression of different downstream NF-κB-dependent genes are differentially codependent on catalytically active IKKα in the presence or absence of extracellular stimuli. Tissue Culture—Growth of IKKα(-/-) MEFs and their stimulation with TNFα were performed as described previously. Wt. IKKα/CHUK-HA or IKKα(K44M)-HA (a kinase-inactive ATP binding domain mutant with lysine 44 mutated to methionine) with carboxyl-terminal HA epitope tags (30.Connelly M.A. Marcu K.B. Cell. Mol. Biol.

Massa P.E. Hanidu A. Peet G.W. Aro P. Savitt A. Mische S. Li J. Marcu K.B. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). IKKα(-/-) cells harboring an empty retroviral vector (EV cells) were simultaneously generated as a matched negative control. RNA Preparation—Total cellular RNAs were extracted from cell lysates with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Purified RNAs were converted to double-stranded cDNA with a Super Script Double Stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (GENSET). Biotin-labeled cRNAs were generated from the cDNA samples by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Enzo kit, Enzo Diagnostics). The labeled cRNAs were fragmented to an average size of 35-200 bases by incubation at 94 °C for 35 min. Hybridization (16 h), washing, and staining protocols have been described (Affymetrix Gene Chip Expression Analysis Technical Manual; (34.Mahadevappa M. Warrington J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1134-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)). DNA Microarrays and Clustering Analysis—We employed Affymetrix MG-U74Av2 chips that include 12,400 genes. Chips were stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes) and scanned with a Hewlett-Packard Gene Array Scanner. DNA microarray chip data analysis was performed using MAS5.1 software (Affymetrix) and as described previously (26.Li X. Massa P.E. Hanidu A. Peet G.W. Aro P. Savitt A. Mische S. Li J. Marcu K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45129-45140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Levels of gene expression were quantitated from the hybridization intensities of 16 pairs of perfectly matched and mismatched control probes (35.Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar) (Affymetrix, Inc.). The average of the differences (perfectly matched minus mismatched) for each gene-specific probe family was calculated and expressed as signal values. The software computes how the expression level of each transcript has changed between the base line and experimental samples (difference call/change call). A change call is a qualitative call that describes whether a transcript in an experimental array has changed compared with a base-line array. One array is designated as the experimental, and another array is designated as the base line. Wilcoxon's signed rank is used to generate a change p value. A change call is assigned based on analysis parameters. Change p values between 0.00 and 0.0025 are given an Increase call. Change p values between 0.0025 and 0.003 are given a marginal increase call. Change p values between 0.997 and 0.998 are given a marginal decrease call. Change p values between 0.998 and 1.00 are given a decrease call (Affymetrix User Manual). For a comparative chip file (such as TNFα-stimulated IKKα(-/-) MEF + Wt. IKKα versus IKKα(-/-) MEF + EV, the experimental file (Wt. IKKα 2T) was compared with the base-line file (EV 2T). We employed the following stringent selection criteria to identify significant changes in gene expression: 1) a change call of increase or marginal increase in both samples, and 2) average -fold change values of 1.5 or greater (minimum of 1.3-fold each) in two independently stimulated samples of IKKα(-/-) MEF + Wt. IKKα 2T versus IKKα(-/-) MEF + EV 2T. The following additional criteria were employed to identify the spectrum of these genes that were also dependent upon NF-κB for their expression: 1) a change call of either increase or marginal increase in Wt. MEF 2T versus Wt. MEF + IκBαSR-Iresneomycin, or 2) a change call of either increase or marginal increase in Wt. MEF 2T versus p50(-/-) MEF 2T, and 3) a valid presence call in Wt. 2T screens. By this analysis we define NF-κB dependence to represent genes whose expressions either directly (true direct targets of NF-κB subunits) or indirectly (other downstream genes whose expressions are affected by the NF-κB pathway) require NF-κB. The TNFα inducibilities of genes rescued by either Wt. IKKα or IKKα(K44M) were based on a combination of the following stringent criteria: 1) increase calls in duplicate 2T versus US microarray screens of IKKα(-/-) MEFs rescued by Wt. IKKα or IKKα(K44M), and/or 2) TaqMan real time PCR analysis performed at least in duplicate and an increase call in one of two screens. By these criteria, the vast majority of IKKα-rescued genes that responded to TNFα did so with -fold change values of 2.0 and higher in duplicate screens with a minimum unstimulated (US) average -fold change value of 1.7. Hierarchical clustering was performed with the Cluster program (available at rana.lbl.gov/) as described previously (36.Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13195) Google Scholar). Genes that have double increase calls and are induced >1.5-fold (average -fold values) in the duplicate primary Wt. IKKα versus EV-rescued IKKα(-/-) MEFs (see above description) were selected. The signal values (equivalent to the quantities of mRNAs, see above) of the selected genes were median-centered by subtracting the median observed value and normalized by genes to the magnitude (sum of the squares of the values) of a row vector to 1.0. The normalized data were clustered by average linkage clustering analysis of the y axis (genes) using an uncentered correlation similarity metric, as described in the program Cluster. Signal values of 50 or less were set to 50 before centering and normalization. The clustered data were visualized with the Treeview program (available at rana.lbl.gov/). TaqMan Real Time Quantitative PCR—TaqMan real time quantitative PCRs were performed as described previously (26.Li X. Massa P.E. Hanidu A. Peet G.W. Aro P. Savitt A. Mische S. Li J. Marcu K.B. J.

PCR Methods Appl. 1995; 4: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Data from TaqMan PCR analyses were normalized based on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA copy numbers using rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control reagents (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan probe sets were designed for the following genes using either Primer Express 1.5 or Bio-Rad Beacon Designer 2.0 software: ATF3, A20, ISG15, MyD118/GADD45β, SAA3, and VCAM1. Murine IL-6 and RANTES TaqMan reagents were obtained from ABI. TaqMan real time PCR experiments were performed in an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector or in a Bio-Rad iCycler. DNA sequences for each of these probe sets are available upon request. Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared in an isotonic lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors. SDS-PAGE (10% gel) transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was performed as described previously, and membranes were probed with primary antibodies to either IKKα (Cell Signaling Technology) or NEMO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by an anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using a Lumi-Light Plus kit (Roche Applied Science). Immunostaining—Prior to immunostaining cells were maintained in 10-cm tissue culture-treated plates in their regular growth medium. Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in 12 ml of growth medium, and plated at 3 ml/well in 6-well plates containing 22-mm glass microscope coverslips (VWR) precoated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The following day, cells were washed and then fixed in 50% methanol and 50% acetone for 10 min. These and all subsequent washes were with phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline, and the coverslips were washed, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% heat-denatured fetal bovine serum for 1 h, and washed again. In situ expression of retrovirally transduced Wt. IKKα-HA and IKKα(K44M)-HA proteins in IKKα(-/-) cells were specifically detected with a primary anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (38.Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). 12CA5 antibody was diluted in blocking solution and applied to the cells followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature. After washing, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson) secondary antibody, diluted 1:2,000 in block solution, was applied for a 1-h incubation at room temperature. The coverslips were washed and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate developing substrate applied (Roche Applied Science). Cells were visualized on a Nikon Diaphot phase-contrast microscope and photographed using a Nikon D1X digital camera. NF-κB DNA Binding—Activation of NF-κB p65-dependent DNA binding activity was quantitated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based kit (Active Motif, Inc.) (39.Renard P. Ernest I. Houbion A. Art M. Le Calvez H. Raes M. Remacle J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E21Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated or 2-h TNFα-stimulated WT. IKKα-null and Wt. IKKα or IKKα(K44M)-rescued IKKα(-/-) MEFs and applied to 96-well plates containing an immobilized NF-κB DNA binding consensus oligonucleotide according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif, Inc.). DNA-bound NF-κB was detected with a p65-specific primary antibody followed by the addition of a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and absorbance quantitated at 450 nm with a microplate spectrophotometer. The specificity of NF-κB DNA binding was confirmed by competitions with wild type and mutant NF-κB binding sequences. Negative controls for stimulus-dependent NF-κB nuclear localization and DNA binding activity also included nuclear extracts prepared from NEMO(-/-) and p65/p50(-/-) MEFs. Physiological Rescue of IKKα(-/-) MEFs with Wt. IKKα IKKα(K44M) Proteins Does Not Interfere with the Induction of NF-κB DNA Binding Activity—By employing DNA microarray chip technology, we previously reported that the IKKα protein was as essential as the IKKβ and NEMO/IKKγ signalsome subunits for the genomic NF-κB-dependent transcriptional response induced by TNFα or IL-1 stimulation. Our finding of a strict requirement for IKKα in the regulation of NF-κB-dependent transcription in MEFs was controversial because earlier studies had shown that cells derived from IKKα-null mice exhibited no significant defect in the stimulus-dependent induction of NF-κB nuclear localization and DNA binding activity. However, in agreement with our observations, two other studies had shown that IKKα was required for the TNFα- and IL-1-dependent transcriptional induction of IL-6 gene expression (25.Sizemore N.

Subsequent to these reports, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the role of IKKα in engendering DNA-bound NF-κB with transcriptional competence was associated with its TNFα-dependent binding to the IκBα gene promoter and with its ability to directly phosphorylate histone H3 on serine 10 in vitro (27.Anest V.

https://openalex.org/W2091654154,"Integrins expressed on leukocytes possess the ability to maintain themselves in a non-adhesive state, thus preventing unwarranted adhesion and uncontrolled inflammation. Leukocyte adhesion is regulated through the modulation of integrin receptors such as αVβ3. Firm adhesion to the extracellular matrix and directed cellular motility requires the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The ability of β3 to recruit signaling and scaffolding molecules to propagate αVβ3 -mediated signals is regulated in part by the phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic tail. The identities of integrin-associated signaling molecules within αVβ3 podosomes and in particular the proximal binding partners of the β3 cytoplasmic tail are not completely known. Here we show that αVβ3 ligation induces Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation and its association with the β3 cytoplasmic tail in a β3-Tyr-747 phosphorylation-dependent manner. Pyk2 binding to the β3 cytoplasmic tail is direct and dependent upon Pyk2-Tyr-402 and β3 -Tyr-747 phosphorylations. These data identify Pyk2 as a phosphorylated β3 binding partner, providing a potential structural and signaling platform to achieve αVβ3 -mediated remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Integrins expressed on leukocytes possess the ability to maintain themselves in a non-adhesive state, thus preventing unwarranted adhesion and uncontrolled inflammation. Leukocyte adhesion is regulated through the modulation of integrin receptors such as αVβ3. Firm adhesion to the extracellular matrix and directed cellular motility requires the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The ability of β3 to recruit signaling and scaffolding molecules to propagate αVβ3 -mediated signals is regulated in part by the phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic tail.

The ability of hematopoietic cells and in particular leukocytes to self-regulate adhesion to complex extracellular matrices is an essential requirement for the maintenance of immunosurveillance. Hematopoietic cells migrate throughout the vasculature in a non-adhesive state until they encounter proinflammatory or thrombotic signals. These signals induce an arrest from the circulation by means of firm adhesion to the vascular walls, extravasation from the vascular compartment, followed by migration to the site of inflammation. The ability of leukocytes to undergo this spatially and temporally integrated multistep process is regulated in part by the integrin αVβ3. The αVβ3 integrin plays a pivotal role in the ability of many cell types to adhere to the extracellular matrix and can also serve as a route of pathogen entry (1Roivainen M. Piirainen L. Hovi T.

Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously shown that, although αVβ3 recognizes many different ligands, there is differentially regulated αVβ3-mediated adhesion to individual ligands, particularly Vn and fibronectin (5Butler B. Williams M.P. Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5264-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Integrin ligation by the extracellular matrix initiates conformational changes within integrin structure and, in the case of αVβ3, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of residues within the β3 cytoplasmic domain. Both of these events are involved in the recruitment of cytosolic proteins in a phosphorylation- and conformation-dependent manner leading to an integrin-associated protein complex. Although phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic tail is required for αVβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn, the cytoplasmic tail itself exhibits no signaling capabilities. Therefore, signaling molecules must be recruited to propagate adhesion-initiated signals to downstream effector proteins. We have previously demonstrated that hematopoietic cells expressing non-tyrosine phosphorylatable β3 integrins fail to adhere due to an inability to form actin stress fibers (5Butler B. Williams M.P. Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5264-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similarly, in mice expressing only non-phosphorylatable β3 integrins, a failure in the maintenance of platelet aggregation can also be attributed to defects in myosin-based contraction of actin fibrils (6Phillips D.R.

Circulation. 2001; 103: 2501-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These findings are likely related to the requirement of β3 phosphorylation for both Rho GTPase activation and recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex to β3-containing podosomes (10Chandhoke S.K. Williams M. Schaefer E. Zorn L. Blystone S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as both of these events are known to lead to actin reorganization within cells. Because it seems unlikely that either Rho or Arp2/3 interact directly with phosphorylated β3, we have pursued identification of the proximal binding partner for phosphorylated β3. Protein-tyrosine kinases are a class of proteins that, once associated with the integrin complex, would be capable of relaying signaling events. Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk-2), also known as cell adhesion kinase-β or related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase, is a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase closely related to p125 focal adhesion kinase that couples receptors, including integrins, with a variety of downstream effectors such as small G proteins belonging to the Ras and Rho families, mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase C, and inositol phosphate metabolism (for review, see Refs. 11Schlaepfer D.D.

Our laboratory has recently shown that Pyk2 co-localizes selectively with tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 in podosomes (10Chandhoke S.K. Williams M. Schaefer E. Zorn L. Blystone S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that Pyk2 associates with β3 in a Pyk2 and β3 tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. The binding of Pyk2 with a β3 cytoplasmic tail appears to be direct as demonstrated by binding of GST-Pyk2 and β3 peptides in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Pyk2 phosphorylation and translocation to tyrosinephosphorylated β3 is blocked by Src kinase inhibition, known to regulate Pyk2 activity. Pharmacological blockade of Pyk2 or β3 phosphorylation also prevents PI3K association with β3. The phosphorylation dependence of β3 in adhesive processes may lie in the ability to recruit the kinase and adaptor capabilities of Pyk2, a molecule suited to supporting a proadhesive signaling complex. Cells and Materials—K562 cells were stably transfected with cDNA encoding wild type β3 (KαVβ3) or cDNA encoding β3 mutated at Y747F (KαVβ3-Y747F), Y759 (KαVβ3-Y759F), or Y747F,Y759F (KαVβ3-Y747F,Y759F) together with αV and maintained as previously described (30Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The anti-β3 monoclonal antibody 7G2 was a gift of Eric J. Brown. Vn was prepared as previously described (30Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Anti-GST, anti-Pyk2, anti-Pyk2Y402P, anti-p85 (PI3K), anti-PY (4G10), anti-AktS473P, anti-talin, anti-Src, and anti-SrcY416P were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-β3 PSSA was purchased from BIO-SOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Synthesized GRGDSP peptide was purchased from Invitrogen. All reagents unless otherwise noted were purchased from Sigma. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—KαVβ3 cells (1 × 107) stably expressing β3 constructs were incubated in suspension with 1 mm GRGDSP (RGD) in serum-free media containing 50 μm Na3VO4 with or without PMA (10 ng/ml), PP1 (10 nm), calphostin C (100 nm), piceatannol (5 μg/ml), wortmannin (10 μm), or Y27632 (10 μm) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were lysed in PBS buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, Na3VO4 (1 mm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with gelatin-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with goat anti-mouse-Sepharose beads (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) precoated with anti-β3 7G2, anti-Pyk2, anti-talin, or anti-PI3K monoclonal antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% w/v bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies followed by peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For adhesion studies, 6-well tissue culture-treated plates were coated with Vn (1 μg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. KαVβ3 cells were plated at 3 × 106 cells/well in serum-free IMDM media containing 50 μm Na3VO4 with or without PMA (10 ng/ml), PP1 (50 nm), calphostin C (100 nm), piceatannol (50 μg/ml), wortmannin (10 μm), or Y27632 (10 μm) for upto 1 h at 37 °Cin5%CO2. All cells in each well were lysed and treated as described above. Pyk2 Overlays—The N terminus of Pyk2 (amino acids 1–432) was cloned into pGex4T-1 by the creation of flanking EcoR1 sites. Additionally, Pyk2-Y402F was created by PCR mutagenesis. GST-Pyk2 constructs were transfected into XL1 Blue cells, and protein production was induced by 5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Bacterial cells were pulse-sonicated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-agarose to purify GST fusion proteins. SDS-PAGE gels were performed to ensure the purity of the constructs. Phosphorylation of GST-Pyk2 constructs by recombinant c-Src was performed as described by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Saranac Lake, NY). Synthetic integrin peptides mimicking the β3 cytoplasmic tail, as employed in a previous study (10Chandhoke S.K. Williams M. Schaefer E. Zorn L. Blystone S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), as well as the corresponding cytoplasmic tail regions from other integrins with indicated modifications (10 μm) (β3 wild type (WT), β3-Y747F, β3-Tyr(P)-747, β1-Tyr(P)-788, β5-Tyr(P)-752, β7-Tyr(P)-778) (Invitrogen) were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% w/v bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with recombinant GST, GST-Pyk2, or GST-Pyk2-Y402F (1 μm) after incubation with (+) or without (–) recombinant Src as described above. Membranes were then probed with anti-β3 or anti-GST and developed by ECL. GST-Pyk2 Pull-downs—Cell lysates were prepared from KαVβ3, KαVβ3-Y747F, KαVβ3-Y759F, or KαVβ3-Y747F,Y759F cells that had been incubated with (+) or without (–) PMA and RGD. Cell lysates were incubated with Src treated or untreated GST-Pyk2, GST-Pyk2-Y402F, or GST-coated agarose beads and incubated at 4 °C for 12 h. Precipitated proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% w/v bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with mAb 7G2 followed by peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and developed by ECL. Cell Adhesion Assays—96-Well microtiter plates (Immulon II, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with Vn (1 μg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed twice in PBS and post-coated with 1% casein in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. KαVβ3 cells were added at 1 × 105 cells/well in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 1.0 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+ with or without PMA (10 ng/ml), PP1 (50 nm), calphostin C (100 nm), piceatannol (50 μg/ml), wortmannin (10 μm), or Y27632 (10 μm) and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were rinsed three times in Hanks' buffered saline solution without Ca2+ or Mg2+, and adherent cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C and stained with 0.05% crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature. Crystal violet was dispersed in methanol and quantified by absorbance at 570 nm using an Emax microplate reader (Amersham Biosciences). Pyk2 Phosphorylation and Activity Are Induced by αvβ3 Ligation—Our previous reports demonstrate a requirement for phosphorylation at Tyr-747 of the β3 cytoplasmic tail for both hematopoietic cell adhesion and Rho association with β3 (5Butler B. Williams M.P. Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5264-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not Pyk2 may mediate these effects, we first evaluated whether or not Pyk2 association with β3 was regulated by the phosphorylation of one or both partners. We evaluated Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation in the presence of known soluble inducers of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation as well as when K562 cells expressing αVβ3 were adherent to Vn. Although Mn2+ (5 mm) and Na3VO4 (100 μm) induced β3-Tyr-747 phosphorylation, there was no significant phosphorylation of Pyk2-Tyr-402 at 15 min with these same stimuli (Fig. 1A). However, when αVβ3 was ligated by incubation with RGD (1 mm) peptide or by adhesion to Vn, there was a significant increase in Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of Pyk2 was augmented with the addition of PMA (Fig. 1A). Previous studies have shown that in many cell types including islet cells and muscle cells, PMA induces Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation (31Wrenn R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Bayer A.L. Heidkamp M.C. Howes A.L. Heller B.J. Byron K.L. Samarel A.M. J. Mol. Cell.

Conversely it has also been shown in T cells that PMA ablates Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation (33Tsuchida M. Manthei E.R. Alam T. Knechtle S.J. Hamawy M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1344-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells of hematopoietic lineage often require additional stimuli, such as thrombin or cytokines, mimicked in vitro by PMA to achieve integrin-mediated firm adhesion (23Sayed M.R. Sheid M.P.

In K562 cells expressing αVβ3 we see an immediate induction of Pyk2 phosphorylation by PMA within 5 min that dissipates by 10 min (Fig. 1B). With the addition of Na3VO4 (100 μm) we see that, whereas β3 phosphorylation is robust at 15 min, Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation is prolonged only slightly to 10 min. However, with αVβ3 ligation, by the addition of RGD peptide we find that β3-Tyr-747 and Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylations remain robust at 15 min (Fig. 1B). The exact role that PMA plays in αVβ3-mediated adhesion remains unclear; however, PMA activates protein kinase Cs, PI3K, and Src family kinases, and it has been demonstrated that Src family kinases and Pyk2 associate in an activation-dependent manner, leading to Pyk2 phosphorylation and Pyk2-mediated signaling (13Dikic I.

We have previously shown in K562 cells expressing αVβ3 that in the presence of PMA, PI3K and Rho are activated when these cells are adherent to Vn (5Butler B. Williams M.P. Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5264-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We examined the role of cellular activation by PMA in Pyk2 and PI3K activation. In cells adherent to Vn in the presence of PMA, Src inhibition by PP1 causes a complete inhibition of Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation as well as PI3K phosphorylation and activity as indicated by Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C) with no effect on β3 phosphorylation (see Fig. 3A). Although wortmannin inhibits PI3K phosphorylation and activity, there was no effect on Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Pyk2 phosphorylation occurs independently of PI3K activity during αVβ3-mediated adhesion. These data indicate that Pyk2 activation via phosphorylation at Tyr-402 requires αVβ3 ligation and Src activity. These data also suggest that Pyk2 activation during αVβ3-mediated adhesion may contribute to PI3K activation in hematopoietic cells.Fig. 3Selective inhibition of Pyk2 association with β3. A, KαVβ3 cells were either kept in suspension in the presence or absence (–) of PMA (10 ng/ml) and RGD (1 mm) or allowed to adhere to Vn in the presence or absence (–) of PMA. Suspension and adhesion groups were incubated with or without known inhibitors to Src kinases (10 nm PP1), PI3K (10 μm wortmannin), protein kinase C (10 μm calphostin C (CC)), Rho-associated coiled kinase (10 μm Y27632), or Syk (50 μg/ml piceatannol (Pic)). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-β3 or anti-Pyk2 bound to Sepharose. Western blotting was performed using PSSA antibodies to Pyk2-Tyr-402 or β3-Tyr-747 or mAb to the p85 subunit of PI3K. Total Pyk2 and PI3K were determined from lysate blots using ¼ of the preimmunoprecipitate lysate. Total β3 was determined by a Western blot of 110 of the β3 immunoprecipitation probed with mAb 7G2. Shown are representative blots for more than three individual experiments. B, selective inhibition of αVβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn.

Immunoprecipitates from cells expressing β3-WT, -Y747F, -Y759F, or -Y747F,Y759F incubated with RGD and PMA show that phosphorylated Tyr-402 Pyk2 associates with the β3 cytoplasmic tail only when Tyr-747 is intact and phosphorylated (Fig. 2A), and we see the same results when we probe with a non-PSSA Pyk2 antibody, indicating that only Pyk2 that is phosphorylated at Tyr-402 is associated with β3. The lack of Pyk2/β3 association in the Y747F and Y747F,Y759F cells is not due to a lack of Pyk2 phosphorylation, as we show that in cells expressing these β3 variants there is Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation with the addition of PMA and RGD. Immunoprecipitates from cells expressing β3-WT, -Y747F, -Y759F, or -Y747F,Y759F adherent to Vn in the presence of PMA also show that phosphorylated Pyk2-Tyr-402 associates with the β3 cytoplasmic tail only when Tyr-747 is intact and phosphorylated (Fig. 2A). Additionally, as with RGD-treated suspension cells, the lack of Pyk2 association with β3 is not due to a lack of Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation, as there is Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation in cells expressing mutant β3 integrins (Fig. 2A). As a control we probed for talin in β3 im-munoprecipitates because we had previously determined in our laboratory that talin binds to the β3 cytoplasmic tail independently of β3-Tyr-747 phosphorylation. Here we show that talin binds to mutated and non-phosphorylated β3 (Fig. 2A). To further elucidate the role of β3-Tyr-747 phosphorylation in Pyk2/β3 association, we show that with decreasing Na3VO4 concentrations and, thus, a reduction in RGD-induced β3-Tyr-747 phosphorylation, there was a corresponding decrease in Pyk2/β3 association (Fig. 2B). As shown and stated earlier, PMA is a known inducer of Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation, and PMA is required for αVβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn. We, therefore, wanted to establish the possible role of PMA in the translocation of Pyk2 to the β3 cytoplasmic tail. Lysates from cells adherent to Vn in the absence of PMA show low levels of β3-Tyr-747 phosphorylation, Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation, and Pyk2/β3 association (Fig. 2C). However, when cells are adhered in the presence of PMA, there is a substantial and rapid increase in β3-Tyr-747 and Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylations as well as Pyk2 translocation to the β3 cytoplasmic tail. Pyk2 is associated with β3 within 5 min, whereas in cells without PMA there is little appreciable association until 30 min post-adhesion (Fig. 2C). These experiments demonstrate that Pyk2 associates with the β3 cytoplasmic tail only when Tyr-747 is intact and phosphorylated. Selective Inhibition of Pyk2 Association with β3—As shown above, inhibition of Src but not PI3K reduces Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation. We wanted to identify signaling pathways that regulate Pyk2 association with β3. To this end we employed pharmacological inhibitors and examined Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation and association with β3 as well as PI3K association with the β3/Pyk2 complex. When suspension cells were treated with PMA/RGD and Vn adherent cells were treated with PMA we saw an increase in Pyk2-Tyr-402 and β3-Tyr-747 phosphorylations (Fig. 3A). The addition of the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 (10 nm) ablates Pyk2-Tyr-402 phosphorylation and Pyk2-Tyr-402 association with β3 in suspension cells treated with PMA and RGD and cells adherent to Vn in the presence of PMA. In adherent cells, PP1 treatment reduces β3-Tyr-747 phosphorylation, presumably due a lack of firm adhesion, a decrease in the number of ligated αVβ3 molecules, and"

B., Gallon, C. E., Hodgkin, M. A., Fattoum, A., Perry, S. V., and Levine, B. A. (2002) Eur. J. Biochem. 269, 5088–5100). We have extended this work and have shown that segments corresponding to other regions of human cardiac β-myosin, presumed to be sites of interaction with F-actin (residues 554–584, 622–646, and 633–660), likewise bind independently to actin under similar conditions. The binding to F-actin of a peptide spanning the minimal inhibitory segment of human cardiac troponin I (residues 134–147) resulted in the dissociation from F-actin of all the myosin peptides bound to it either individually or in combination. Troponin C neutralized the effect of the inhibitory peptide on the binding of the myosin peptides to F-actin. We conclude that the binding of the inhibitory region of troponin I to actin, which occurs during relaxation in muscle when the calcium concentration is low, imposes conformational changes that are propagated to different locations on the surface of actin. We suggest that the role of tropomyosin is to facilitate the transmission of structural changes along the F-actin filament so that the monomers within a structural unit are able to interact with myosin. The N terminus of skeletal myosin light chain 1 and the cardiomyopathy loop of human cardiac myosin have been shown previously to bind to actin in the presence and absence of tropomyosin (Patchell, V.

We suggest that the role of tropomyosin is to facilitate the transmission of structural changes along the F-actin filament so that the monomers within a structural unit are able to interact with myosin. One of the outstanding problems of muscle is to define in protein structural terms how actin interacts with myosin. This interaction enables the conversion of myosin from an enzyme that in the resting muscle hydrolyzes its substrate, MgATP, at a very low rate to one with the high rate associated with contraction. These features are intrinsic to the regulatory process. Crystals of actomyosin or the myosin head (S1) complexed with actin are not yet available to permit the determination of the high resolution structure of the myosin motor domain bound to actin. Nevertheless, modeling of the interaction using the known structures of actin and myosin S1, mutation studies, and a variety of experimental approaches have highlighted a number of regions on the myosin motor domain that may be involved in the interaction (1Rayment I.

It was concluded from the original structural studies on chicken skeletal myosin S1 that the interface with actin is likely to involve at least three exposed segments common to members of the myosin family (1Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, 2Milligan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Implicated in making contact with a single actin subunit were the regions comprising chicken skeletal myosin residues 403–416 (the so-called “cardiomyopathy” loop), the helix-turn-helix region, residues 529–558, and residues 626–647 (loop 2, at the protease-sensitive junction between the 50- and 20-kDa domains). Another surface loop, residues 567–578, has been modeled as interacting with an adjacent actin monomer (1Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A.

The short cardiomyopathy loop of myosin is resolved as a well defined surface protrusion that is modeled as docking onto actin upon strong binding of myosin (4Volkmann N. Hanein D. Ouyang G.

This loop region is clearly significant for actomyosin interaction because residue deletion results in the loss of the strong binding of actin to myosin (3Sasaki N. Asukagawa H. Yasuda R.

The affinity of these peptides for F-actin was observed to increase slightly in the presence of tropomyosin, whereas their interaction was prevented by the binding of the inhibitory region of troponin I to actin (22Patchell V.B. Gallon C.E. Hodgkin M.A. Fattoum A. Perry S.V. Levine B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5088-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have extended these observations to peptides representing the other presumptive binding regions of myosin, and we have investigated their individual actin-binding properties. Our results indicate that three loops on the surface of the myosin molecule, human cardiac β-myosin residues 398–414, 554–584, and 623–660, interact with distinct sites on the actin molecule. These interactions provided the opportunity to explore the regulatory effects of tropomyosin and troponin-I. In the case of each myosin peptide, the nature of the residues making contact with F-actin was unaltered by tropomyosin. Interaction of the inhibitory region of human cardiac troponin-I with F-actin in the absence or presence of tropomyosin displaced all three myosin contacts. Some aspects of this work have been briefly reported in abstract form elsewhere (25Gallon C.E. Patchell V.B. Levine B.A. Perry S.V. J. Muscle Cell Motil. 2003; 24: 327Google Scholar). Peptides—The peptides of human cardiac β-myosin and human cardiac troponin-I (hcTnI) used in this study (Table I) were synthesized with acetylated N- and amidated C-terminal residues (Alta Bioscience, Birmingham University) and were purified as described previously (22Patchell V.B.

The composition and purity of all peptides were confirmed by mass spectral and NMR analyses. Amino acid analysis was used to determine the concentration of each of the stock peptide solutions used for the fluorescence and NMR studies.Table ISequences of the peptides of hcβM, human and rabbit cardiac troponin I (hcTnI, rcTnI) used in this studyPeptideSequencehcβM-(291-311)SNKKPELLDMLLITNNPYDYAhcβM-(365-388)KLKQREEQAEPDGTEEADKSAYLMhcβM-(398-414)GLCHPRVKVGNEYVTKGhcβM-(554-584)DNHLGKSANFQKPRNIKGKPEAHFSLIHYAGhcβM-(622-646)ANYAGADAPIEKGKGKAKKGSSFQThcβM-(633-660)KGKGKAKKGSSFQTVSALHRENLNKLMThcTnI-(128-153)TQKIFDLRGKFKRPTLRRVRISADAMhcTnI-(128-140)TQKIFDLRGKFKRhcTnI-(141-153)PTLRRVRISADAMrcTnI-(164-184)AKETLDLRAHLKQVKKEDTEK Open table in a new tab Muscle Proteins—Actin was isolated freeze-dried from rabbit skeletal muscle using the method of Spudich and Watt (26Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 264: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Measurement of the absorbance of G-actin at 290 nm was used to determine the concentration of the G-actin in the solution. The actin concentration was calculated using the empirical observation that absorbance at 290 nm of a 1 mg/ml solution is equal to 0.63 units (26Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 264: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). F-actin was prepared in a solution containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl as described previously (22Patchell V.B. Gallon C.E. Hodgkin M.A. Fattoum A. Perry S.V. Levine B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5088-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and dialyzed overnight against several changes of 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in H2O2 for fluorescence measurements or H2O for the NMR titration studies. The F-actin-tropomyosin complex was made by adding G-actin to a stock solution of 1 mg/ml rabbit skeletal tropomyosin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, to give a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml actin, 0.5 mg/ml tropomyosin. The complex was dialyzed into several changes of 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in 2H2O. Complex formation and the absence of free protein was confirmed by comparison with the electrophoretic patterns of the free proteins obtained upon electrophoresis on 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels run in 10% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm Tris, 80 mm glycine, pH 8.3. G-actin labeled at Cys-374 with IAEDANS was prepared according to the method of Miki et al. (27Miki M. dos Remedios C.G. Barden J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as reported previously (22Patchell V.B. Gallon C.E. Hodgkin M.A. Fattoum A. Perry S.V. Levine B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5088-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The extent of labeling was normally 0.8–0.9 mol/mol G-actin. This preparation of labeled G-actin was polymerized using 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and aliquots were stored frozen for subsequent use. Fluorescence Measurements—All fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence spectrometer. Emission fluorescence intensity values (IAEDANS excitation at 340 nm) were corrected for solvent emission fluorescence and any dilution effects (<5%) resulting from the titration carried out by the sequential addition of small (1–5 μl) volumes of the peptide solution. The fractional change in fluorescence observed was assumed to be directly proportional to the fraction of the complex formed. The dissociation constant was derived using a nonlinear regression procedure fitting the fluorescence data obtained in separate titrations to a 1:1 binding curve. NMR Studies—All spectra were obtained using a Bruker 500-MHz DRX spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. The residue-specific assignment of peptide resonances was carried out using standard protocols following the acquisition of total correlation spectroscopy and NOESY spectra using samples in 90% H2O solution. Titration of the myosin peptides (concentration range used 40–300 μm) with F-actin was typically carried out by sequential addition of aliquots of F-actin (10 mg/ml) or F-actin-tropomyosin (5 mg/ml F-actin) at T = 293 K in 2H2O solution, pH 7.4, buffered with 25 mm Tris HCl. The molar proportions of the components of each mixture were obtained from the respective concentrations in solution. The broad signals of the spectrum of F-actin obtained upon these additions contributed relatively little to the spectra of the peptides in the presence of actin. Confirmation of the extent of relaxation resulting from interaction with F-actin was obtained by use of two-pulse spin-echo spectra (1024 transients) using a (90–180-t) sequence with a delay time, t = 60 ms, and an overall delay of 3 s to enable complete magnetization recovery. In these experiments the coupling constant and relaxation time of individual resonances modulate the signal amplitudes that therefore provide sensitive indicators of the extent of complex formation. The spectral perturbations were also visualized by difference spectra taken at each stage of the titration. The identification of contact residues on a small peptide interacting with a much larger protein can be undertaken by the use of NMR spectroscopy to detect the broadening of the signals from residues of the peptide at the molecular interface. This broadening is a consequence of the much faster relaxation rate in the bound state and the dynamic process of exchange between free and bound states of the target peptide (28Lian L-Y.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 30Jardetzky O. Roberts G.C.K. NMR in Molecular Biology. Academic Press, New York1981Google Scholar). The interface with F-actin can be characterized by the progressive perturbation of specific peptide resonances during titration that directly reflects the population of the free and bound states of each peptide. The use of a cryogenic probe for such experiments permits titrations to be carried out using concentrations in the low micromolar range thereby reducing the probability of nonspecific interaction. Titrations monitored by both NMR and fluorescence have been used to confirm that binding is saturable and of defined stoichiometry. The directness of this experimental approach has allowed us to investigate the F-actin and actin-tropomyosin binding characteristics of different regions of the human β-cardiac myosin head and the modulation of these actin associations by the inhibitory region of human cardiac troponin-I. Multiple Contacts of Residues 398–414 of Human Cardiac β-Myosin with F-actin Involve a Preference for a Looped Conformation—In view of the importance of the cardiomyopathy loop region in the activation of the myosin ATPase (e.g. Refs. 3Sasaki N.

Schroder R.R. Nature. 2003; 425: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and the ability of the cardiac myosin peptide hcβM-(398–414) (Table I) to competitively inhibit actin-activated myosin ATPase (23Bartegi A. Roustan C. Chavanieu A. Kassab R. Fattoum A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we have defined the nature of this interaction in detail by carrying out titrations with F-actin by using a range of concentrations of the peptide (40–300 μm). As shown in Fig. 1, the presence of sub-stoichiometric concentrations of F-actin resulted in extensive signal broadening with spectral line widths dominated by the bound ligand cross-relaxation that results from the substantial increase in correlation time of the peptide bound to F-actin. The progressive line broadening observed with increasing concentration of F-actin (Fig. 1) reports on the relative population of free and bound states of the peptide, and the interaction interface can be robustly defined by inspection of the progressively broadened resonances. Notably affected at low ratios of complexed to free peptide are the side chain signals of Gly-407 and Asn-408 with the resonances deriving from His-401, Arg-403, Glu-409, Tyr-410, Val-411, and Thr-412 increasingly broadened in the presence of higher concentrations of F-actin (Fig. 1). The observation of line width perturbation for all of these uniquely resolved peptide signals in the presence or absence of tropomyosin indicates that hcβM-(398–414) lies close to the actin surface along most of its length. Of significance with regard to the extensive nature of the association between hcβM-(398–414) and F-actin was the NOESY-based evidence that the sequence Val-406 to Asn-408 in the middle of the peptide was characterized by a predisposition to adopt a β-turn conformation. Clearly resolved in the amide region of the proton NOESY spectrum is the (i → i + 2) NOE cross-peak that identifies the time-average proximity of the side chain methyl group(s) of Val-406 and the backbone –NH of Asn-408 (Fig. 2). The relatively strong intensity of this (i → i + 2) cross-peak compared with the variety of inter-residue (i → i + 1) NOE detected suggests the presence of a significant population of the turn conformation of the central region of the peptide. This conclusion is supported by the further observation of the nonequivalence of the resonances of the two Cα protons of Gly-407 (Fig. 2) that is indicative of a preferred rotamer population (30Jardetzky O. Roberts G.C.K. NMR in Molecular Biology. Academic Press, New York1981Google Scholar). Because the sequences flanking the central turn region of hcβM-(398–414) contain charged residues, we proceeded to investigate the sensitivity of the interaction of F-actin with the peptide to ionic strength. These spectral studies showed that the addition of salt did not significantly alter the structured predisposition of the central region of the peptide, and we observed that the interaction is salt concentration-dependent, with the actin-induced perturbation of the different residues along the peptide chain virtually undetectable in 50 mm KCl (Fig. 3). Earlier binding studies using peptides incorporating the site mutations R403Q and E407S have shown that actin affinity remained unaffected by these single charge changes with randomization of the peptide sequence resulting in the loss of actin binding (23Bartegi A. Roustan C. Chavanieu A. Kassab R. Fattoum A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although our results indicate multiple contacts with F-actin along the sequence of hcβM-(398–414), they do not preclude the possibility that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of this peptide bind to actin with differing affinity. Complex formation by hcβM-(398–414), however, appears to be mediated by electrostatic contributions, a characteristic previously only associated with the interaction of loop 2 of myosin with F-actin (5Joel P.B.

Localization of the Residues of Loop 2 of Human Cardiac β-Myosin That Interact with F-actin—Two overlapping segments of the loop 2 region of human cardiac β-myosin, peptide 600A, residues 622–646, and peptide 600B, residues 633–660 (Table I), were studied to compare the nature of their interaction with F-actin. Perturbation of residues 633–646 in the overlapping region was observed with both peptides in the presence of F-actin. Although neither peptide was found to interact with tropomyosin in control titrations, comparable spectral broadening in the case of each peptide occurred at lower F-actin:peptide molar ratios when tropomyosin was present. These observations indicated that tropomyosin had increased the actin-binding affinity of each peptide but had not altered the nature of the residues involved in the association with F-actin. In the case of hcβM-(622–646), a very restricted subset of peptide residues was observed to interact with F-actin (Fig. 4). Marked spectral perturbation occurred for the extreme C-terminal residues Gly-641, Phe-644, Gln-645, and Thr-646. Resonances of residues at the N-terminal of hcβM-(622–646), Tyr-624, Ala-629, Ile-631, and Glu-632 remained virtually unaffected and even retained fine structure (Fig. 4B). These observations indicated that the N-terminal region of the bound peptide extended away from the actin surface and retained segmental mobility independent of F-actin. Inspection of the lysine ϵCH2 side chain resonance that is derived from the cluster of five basic residues adjacent to the C-terminal of hcβM-(622–646) showed that this composite signal was only slightly altered upon association with F-actin (Fig. 4B). The comparably small perturbation detected for Ala-638 and the clear demarcation observed between the actin-bound C-terminal residues and those at the mobile N terminus of hcβM-(622–646) suggested that the actin-induced spectral alteration in the composite lysine resonance could have resulted from the involvement in complex formation of Lys-639 and/or Lys-640 at the C terminus of the basic cluster. The interaction of hcβM-(622–646) with F-actin was, however, relatively stable to increasing ionic strength with complex formation virtually abolished only in the presence of 0.2 m KCl (Fig. 4C). Notably, acetylation of the lysine residues of hcβM-(622–646) resulted in the complete loss of actin binding with complex formation undetectable even when F-actin was present in solution at a 2.5 m excess (Fig. 4D). The actin affinity of hcβM-(622–646) was determined by monitoring the change in the fluorescence emission of IAEDANS-labeled F-actin (Fig. 5A) under solution conditions corresponding to the NMR experiment shown (Fig. 4B). Saturation of the quenching of the emission of the IAEDANS label attached to actin Cys-374 was observed with an apparent dissociation constant of 1 ± 0.5 μm derived for 1:1 complex formation. Taken overall, the observations are indicative of a specific mode of docking involving the C-terminal residues of hcβM-(622–646). These residues occur in the central region of hcβM-(633–660) whose interaction with F-actin showed that the composite lysine side chain signal was relatively unperturbed by complex formation (Fig. 5B), again suggestive of a fluctuating interaction with the surface of actin by a restricted subset of the cluster of basic residues at the N-terminal of loop 2 of human cardiac β-myosin. The association of hcβM-(633–660) with F-actin involved residues Phe-644, Val-647, His-651, Arg-652, Met-659, and Thr-660 downstream of the basic N terminus (Fig. 5B). Specificity of Interaction of the Myosin Loop Peptides with F-actin Is Demonstrated by the Failure of Other Surface-exposed Regions of Myosin S1 to Associate with Actin—Inspection of the published structures of the myosin head shows two other regions that jut away from the surface of the molecule in a location close to the cardiomyopathy loop and loop 2 protrusions. The corresponding sequences of human cardiac β-myosin, hcβM-(291–311) and hcβM-(365–388) (Table I), were therefore synthesized for study of their potential actin-binding properties. No detectable spectral changes resulted upon titration of either peptide with F-actin or with F-actin-tropomyosin (Fig. 6). Resonances of hcβM-(291–311) (e.g. Lys-293, Lys-294, Thr-304, Tyr-308, Tyr-310, and Ala-311) retained fine structures even when present at a concentration equivalent to an equimolar ratio of peptide:F-actin (Fig. 6, A and B). Similarly, no detectable actin-induced spectral perturbation was observed for signals of residues along the sequence of hcβM-(365–388) (Lys-365, Lys-367, Leu-366, Leu-387, Thr-368, Arg-369, and Tyr-386; Fig. 6, C and D). These experiments using hcβM-(291–311) and hcβM-(365–388) indicated the complete absence of any interactions with the surface of actin and provided robust evidence for the specificity of complex formation with F-actin observed with the cardiomyopathy and the loop 2 regions that are also located on the same face of the myosin head. Concurrent Interaction of Three Different Myosin Loop Peptides with F-actin Indicates That They Possess Distinct Binding Sites—In order to study actin-binding site selectivity, equimolar mixtures of different myosin peptides were titrated with actin and actin-tropomyosin. As well as the human cardiac β-myosin cardiomyopathy loop and loop 2 peptides, we made use of a peptide comprising human cardiac β-myosin residues 554–584 also located on the same surface of the myosin head and modeled to be an actin-binding region (1Rayment I.

https://openalex.org/W2004387498,"Hemocyanins are large respiratory proteins of arthropods and mollusks, which bind oxygen with very high cooperativity. Here, we investigated the relationship between oxygen binding and structural changes of the 24-mer tarantula hemocyanin. Oxygen binding of the hemocyanin was detected following the fluorescence intensity of the intrinsic tryptophans. Under the same conditions, structural changes were monitored by the non-covalently bound fluorescence probe Prodan (6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene), which is very sensitive to its surroundings. Upon oxygen binding of the hemocyanin a red shift of 5 nm in the emission maximum of the label was observed. A comparison of oxygen binding curves recorded with tryptophan and Prodan emission revealed that structural changes in tarantula hemocyanin lag behind oxygen binding at the beginning of oxygenation. Analyses based on the nested two-state model, which describes cooperative oxygen binding of hemocyanins, indicated that the transition monitored by Prodan emission is closely related to one of the four conformations (rR) predicted for the allosteric unit. Earlier, the allosteric unit of tarantula hemocyanin was found to be the 12-mer half-molecule. Here, fluorescence titration revealed that the number of Prodan binding sites/24-mer tarantula hemocyanin is approximately 2, matching the number of allosteric units/hemocyanin. Based on the agreement between oxygen binding curves and fluorescence titration we concluded that Prodan monitors a conformational transition of the allosteric unit."

During lipid metabolism, apoA-I moves among HDL and triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. The main structure and the major lipid binding motif of apoA-I is the amphipathic α-helix. To understand how apoA-I behaves at hydrophobic lipoprotein interfaces, the interfacial properties of apoA-I and an amphipathic α-helical consensus sequence peptide (CSP) were studied at the triolein/water (TO/W) interface. CSP ((PLAEELRARLRAQLEELRERLG)2-NH2) contains two 22-residue tandem repeat sequences that form amphipathic α-helices modeling the central part of apoA-I. ApoA-I or CSP added into the aqueous phase surrounding a triolein drop lowered the interfacial tension (γ) of TO/W in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. The γTO/W was lowered ∼16 millinewtons (mN)/m by apoA-I at 1.4 × 10–6 m and ∼15 mN/m by CSP at 2.6 × 10–6 m. At equilibrium γ, both apoA-I and CSP desorbed from the interface when compressed and readsorbed when expanded. The maximum surface pressure CSP could withstand without being ejected (ΠMAX) was 16 mN/m. The ΠMAX of apoA-I was only 14.8 mN/m, but re-adsorption kinetics suggested that only part of the apoA-I desorbed at Π between 14.8 and 19 mN/m. However, above ∼19 mN/m (ΠOFF) the entire apoA-I molecule desorbed into the water. ApoA-I was more flexible at the TO/W interface than CSP and showed more elasticity at oscillation periods 4–128 s even at high compression, whereas CSP was elastic only at faster periods (4 and 8 s) and moderate compression. Flexibility and surface pressure-mediated desorption and re-adsorption of apoA-I probably provides lipoprotein stability during metabolic-remodeling reactions in plasma.

Small D.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 403-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It promotes cholesterol efflux from tissues to the liver for excretion and is a cofactor for lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is responsible for the formation of most plasma cholesterol esters. ApoA-I exchanges off HDL onto other lipoproteins like very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and moves back and forth among lipoprotein classes in the course of its metabolism. Thus the conformational adaptability of apoA-I to the polar environment in plasma and the apolar environment on lipoprotein particles is essential for their function. The predominant secondary structure feature of apoA-I is the 11/22-mer tandem repeat amino acid segments with high propensity to form amphipathic α-helices (1Atkinson D. Small D.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 403-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Segrest J.P. Jackson R.L. Morrisett J.D. Gotto Jr., A.M.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the amphipathic α-helices in apoA-I are class A amphipathic α-helices, which have a large (30–50%) apolar face with the positive residues distributed in the polar-nonpolar interface and are highly suited to lipid binding. This structure is thought to serve as the lipid association motif of apoA-I and to stabilize the lipoprotein surface. ApoA-I exists in at least three states during metabolism: lipid-poor or free in solution, bound to a discoidal nascent HDL assembled with phospholipids and free cholesterol in a bilayer, or at the surface of a spherical lipoprotein particle (HDL or VLDL) with an apolar core of cholesterol esters and triglycerides, and a surface of phospholipids and free cholesterol (4Small D.M. Kreisberg R.A. Segrest J.P. Current Issues in Endocrinology and Metabolism: Plasma Lipoproteins and Coronary Artery Disease. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Boston, MA1992: 57-91Google Scholar). It is believed that apoA-I interacts primarily with the phospholipid hydrocarbon chains on discoidal HDL, and it is possible that it also interacts with the hydrophobic core of HDL particles and with the hydrophobic core of VLDL.

It is generally agreed that the C-terminal region of apoA-I (185–243 amino acids) has the highest affinity for lipid and plays a critical role in initiating the lipid binding.

As one could expect, apolipoproteins (apoA-I, apoA-II, apoC-I, apoC-II, apoA-IV, and apoE) are all surface-active and lower the surface energy. Exclusion pressures (Πe) at which the apoproteins could no longer penetrate into the phospholipids monolayer have been measured. For instance, apoA-I has an Πe of ∼33 mN/m (18Phillips M.C. Krebs K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) at the egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) A/W interface, whereas the Πe of apoA-II is 34 mN/m and that of apoA-IV is 29 mN/m at the egg PC A/W interface. The Πe of synthesized 8 tandem-repeating 22-mer domains of apoA-I at egg PC A/W interface has also been measured (15Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillip M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S.

Among the 22-mers, the N- and C-terminal peptides (44–65 amino acids and 220–241 amino acids) exhibited the highest Πe (28 mN/m and 30 mN/m), whereas other central peptides exhibited lower Πe values (<23 mN/m).

Some of these peptides, as short as 18 amino acids, have high Πe in phospholipid monolayers, and others exhibit lower Πe depending upon the specific amino acid arrangement of the amphipathic helical segment. For instance, upon substituting phenylalanine (Phe) for other hydrophobic residues in an A-type 18-residue α-helix (18A), Πe rose from 30 mN/m for 18A-1F to 46 mN/m for 18A-6F (27Datta G. Chaddha M.

It is expected to comprise two antiparallel 20-residue amphipathic α-helices linked by a 4-residue proline-containing turn and is an idealized fundamental structural motif of exchangeable apolipoproteins (16Chao, Y. (2002) Conformational Studies of a Consensus Sequence Peptide (CSP) and a Real Sequence Peptide (RSP) of Apolipoproteins by Circular Dichroism and X-ray Crystallography.

J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that CSP binds strongly to the DD/W interface and the A/W interface to lower the interfacial tension (γ) and the free energy (28Wang L. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37480-37491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CSP binds more tightly to the DD/W interface than the A/W interface, but it lies flat on both interfaces at saturation with an average area per residue of 14–16 Å2. It can be compressed 6–12% while remaining on the surface, but it is ejected from the surface above a critical surface pressure (ΠMAX). ΠMAX on the A/W interface is 20.3 mN/m, but more than 10 mN/m higher on DD/W (31.7 mN/m). We suggest that surface pressure-mediated desorption and re-adsorption of amphipathic α-helices provide lipoprotein stability during remodeling reactions in plasma. We have also studied the interfacial properties of two amphipathic β strand (AβS) consensus peptides of apoB (P27 and P12) on DD/W and triolein/water (TO/W) interfaces (30Wang L. Small D.M J. lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1704-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unlike CSP peptide, AβS peptides show stronger binding to these oil/water interfaces, and the bound peptides are difficult to force off the surface under compression. Furthermore, AβS peptides are almost purely elastic on DD/W, TO/W, and A/W interfaces when oscillated at periods from 4 to 128 s and from 6 to 25% deformation. In this report, we examined the interfacial properties of native apoA-I and CSP at a more physiological TO/W interface. We measured and compared the adsorption isotherms, desorption behaviors, and the elasticity properties of both the protein and the peptide. Based on our results, we propose a probable mechanism for how apoA-I behaves at a hydrophobic interface, partly detaching at lower surface pressure and fully detaching at high pressures. Such information will be helpful to understand the structure of apolipoproteins on lipoprotein surfaces and the structural changes that occur during remodeling of lipoproteins in plasma. The CSP peptide ((PLAEELRARLRAQLEELRERLG)2-NH2), which contains two 22-amino acid tandem repeats derived from the consensus sequence of the tandem repeats of human apoA-I, apoA-IV, and apoE (28Wang L. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37480-37491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys.

Stock solution of CSP (9–10 mg/ml) was prepared in ultra-filtered water obtained from a Hydro (Research Triangle Park, NC) Picosystem. The peptide has been shown to exhibit ∼90% α-helical conformation in solution (16Chao, Y. (2002) Conformational Studies of a Consensus Sequence Peptide (CSP) and a Real Sequence Peptide (RSP) of Apolipoproteins by Circular Dichroism and X-ray Crystallography.

To measure the interfacial tension of the TO/W interface with CSP, varied amounts of peptide stocks were added to the aqueous phase to obtain different peptide concentrations (from 7 × 10–9 m to 5 × 10–6 m). The pH of the aqueous phase was kept at pH 7.4 with phosphate buffer (2 mm). Triolein (>99% pure) was purchased from NU-CHEK PREP, Inc. (Elysian, MN), and its interfacial tension was 32 mN/m. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Human apoA-I was isolated and purified as described previously (31Wetterau J.R. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10961-10966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfolded human plasma apoA-I (0.1 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 6 m guanidine in the cold room overnight, then dialyzed against 6 m urea, 4 m guanidine, and 2 m guanidine overnight separately, and then dialyzed against pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (0.02 m) for 2 days. An Amicon was used to concentrate the apoA-I solution. Its purity was assessed by running a SDS-PAGE mini-gel; its folded state was checked by CD spectroscopy, and the apoA-I concentration was measured by protein assay. For interfacial tension measurements on the TO/W interface, varied amounts of apoA-I stocks were added to the aqueous phase to obtain different protein concentrations (from 1.7 × 10–8 m to 1.4 × 10–6 m). The pH of the aqueous phase was kept at pH 7.4 with phosphate buffer (2 mm). The interfacial tension of the TO/W interface in the presence of different amounts of CSP or apoA-I in the aqueous phase was measured with an I. T. CONCEPT (Longessaigne, France) Tracker oil-drop tensiometer (32Labourdenne S. Gaudry-Rolland N. Letellier S. Lin M. Cagna A. Esposito G. Verger R. Rivière C. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 71: 163-173Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 8-μl triolein drops were formed in gently stirred pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (6.0 ml) containing a given amount of apoA-I or CSP peptide. The interfacial tension was recorded continuously until it approached an equilibrium. The surface pressure Π was obtained from γ of the interface without CSP or apoA-I (γ0) minus the surface tension of the interface with CSP or apoA-I (γ), i.e. Π = γ0 – γ. All experiments were carried out at 25 ± 0.1 °C in a thermostated system. Once the interfacial tension curve approached an equilibrium, the oil drop (8 μl) was compressed by rapidly decreasing the volume by about 25% (2 μl), 12% (1 μl), or 6% (0.5 μl). In some experiments with apoA-I, larger compression was achieved by decreasing the oil drop volume by up to 5 μl (62%). The sudden decrease in volume instantaneously decreased the drop surface area and resulted in a sudden compression causing the tension to decrease abruptly. The oil drop was held at this reduced volume for about 5 or 10 min, and the surface tension was recorded continuously. If peptide or protein molecules readily desorbed from the surface, the surface tension rose back toward the equilibrium value, and this is called the desorption curve. If peptide or protein molecules stayed on the interface, γ would not change. To expand the interface, the decreased volume of the oil drop was rapidly increased by about 25% (2 μl), 12% (1 μl), or 6% (0.5 μl) back to its initial volume (8 μl), respectively. In cases following larger compression of apoA-I, the decreased volume of the oil drop was increased by up to 5 μl back to its initial volume (8 μl). As a result the surface area increased, and the tension abruptly increased. If molecules adsorbed from the bulk phase to adhere to the newly formed extra surface, then the surface tension would drop back toward the equilibrium, and this is called the readsorption curve. The 25% desorption and adsorption curves were fitted by a bi-exponential equation: y = y0 + A1exp(–x/t1) + A2exp(–x/t2). The time constant t1 and t2 are related to desorption and adsorption processes (28Wang L. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37480-37491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To estimate the maximum pressure (ΠMAX) that the peptide or protein molecule could withstand without being ejected from the surface, a series of experiments were carried out in which the oil drop volume was decreased abruptly to increase the surface pressure (i.e. decrease the γ) to a given value, Π0, and then the interfacial tension γ was followed for 3–10 min. The change in tension (Δγ) was then plotted against Π0. A positive Δγ indicated that the bound peptide or protein molecules had desorbed from the surface. If there was no change in γ, it indicated that the peptide or protein molecule on the surface remained there without desorption. In addition, a negative Δγ indicated that the peptide or protein molecules in the bulk solution were still able to adsorb onto the surface; that is, that Π0 was not quite at equilibrium. The plot of the Π0 versus Δγ was fitted to a straight line. The intercept at Δγ = 0 gave the Π at which peptide or protein molecules showed no net adsorption or desorption, this is the so-called ΠMAX. Because apoA-I consists of 10 putative tandem-repeating amphipathic α-helical domains, it may partially desorb from the interface under compression. ΠMAX of apoA-I gives the estimated pressure at which bound apoA-I starts to be pushed off the interface. To estimate the pressure at which the whole molecule of apoA-I is ejected from the interface, we used the same method used to estimate ΠMAX except that we used larger (>50%) compressions and re-expansions of the interface. We then compared the re-adsorption curve (after the desorption process) with the initial adsorption curve and identified all cases where the curves were almost identical under the same conditions. When the re-adsorption curve was identical to the initial adsorption curve (see Fig. 6B for example) in the same interfacial tension range, it indicated that the compression used had displaced the entire molecule of apoA-I into the aqueous phase. For these cases we plotted Δγ against Π0 and fitted the data to a straight line. The intercept at Δγ = 0 gave the Π at which the whole apoA-I molecule started to be ejected from the interface (see “Results” for detail), which we call ΠOFF. When the compression was less and gave rise to a lower Π0, the re-adsorption curve was much faster than the initial adsorption curve in the same γ range (see Fig. 6A for example). This indicated that only part of apoA-I was displaced from the surface and could re-adsorb very rapidly when the surface was expanded. The data from those cases formed a separate line with a different slope (Fig. 7), where ΠMAX was the lowest Π needed to displace part of apoA-I from the interface.Fig. 7The estimation of ΠMAX and ΠOFF of apoA-I at the TO/W interface. Changes of γ (Δγ) during compression plotted against the instant pressure (Π0) generated right after compression. Open circles (fast re-adsorption): only part of apoA-I was pushed off the interface. The intercept of the fitted line at γ = 0 gives the value of ΠMAX of apoA-I; crosses (slow re-adsorption): whole apoA-I was pushed off the interface and had to re-adsorb from solution. The intercept of the fitted line at γ = 0 gives the threshold value of ΠOFF of apoA-I. Therefore, when compressed to pressures above 14.8 mN/m, part of apoA-I was pushed off the interface, whereas only at pressures above 18.9 mN/m did whole apoA-I begin to be ejected from the interface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Equilibrium Oscillations—When the tension approached an equilibrium value, the volume of the triolein drop was sinusoidally oscillated at different periods (frequencies) ranging from 4 to 128 s (0.25–0.008Hz) and different amplitudes of about ±25%, ±12% or ±6%. As the volume V was oscillated in a sinusoidal fashion, interfacial area A and surface tension γ were recorded continuously and the phase angle ϕ between compression and expansion computed. The interfacial elasticity modulus ϵ was derived (ϵ = dγ/d ln A). The elasticity real part ϵ′ and the elasticity imaginary part ϵ″ were obtained (ϵ′= |ϵ| cos ϕ, ϵ″= |ϵ| sin ϕ) (33Benamins J. Lucassen-Reynders E.H. Möbius D. Miller R. Proteins at Liquid Interfaces. Elsevier, Amsterdam1998: 341-384Google Scholar, 34Benamins J. Cagna A. Lucassen-Reynders E.H. Coll. and Surf. 1996; 114: 245-254Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Continuous Oscillation—Continuous oscillations were carried out 10 s after an 8-μl oil drop was formed in CSP or apoA-I solution. Allowing 10 s to form the drop allowed the system to stabilize. Then the volume was oscillated in separate experiments at different periods (4, 8, and 16 s) and different amplitude of about ±25%, ±12%, or ±6% continuously until the mean interfacial tension reached an equilibrium. This gave a continuous measurement of the mean surface tension (and surface pressure), ϵ, ϵ′, ϵ″, and ϕ. Adsorption of CSP on Triolein/Water (TO/W) Interface—Fig. 1 shows a typical set of interfacial tension (γ) curves of the TO/W interface with different amounts of CSP in the aqueous phase. The γ of TO/W interface was about 32 mN/m. When adding different amounts of CSP into the aqueous phase (7 × 10–9 m to 4.9 × 10–6 m), the CSP molecule adsorbed onto the TO/W interface and lowered γ to approach an equilibrium value. At the most dilute concentration (7 × 10–9 m, Fig. 1, curve a), γ showed a very slow decrease over about 7000 s (lag period), then a sharp decrease, and then a very gradual decrease approaching an equilibrium value at about 19 mN/m, which generated 13-mN/m pressure on the surface. As the CSP concentration increased, the lag period shortened, and the steepness of the rapid fall of γ increased. At the highest concentration (2.6 × 10–6 m) shown in Fig. 1, γ did not show the lag period and started falling rapidly at a very early stage and reached 16.7 mN/m at 1 h, which generated 15.3-mN/m surface pressure. In our previous study (27Datta G. Chaddha M. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Garber D.W. Mishra V.K. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1096-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have shown that CSP can generate up to ∼31-mN/m pressure on the DD/W interface and up to ∼24.5-mN/m pressure on the A/W interface. CSP generated less pressure at the TO/W interface than at DD/W and A/W interfaces, because the starting γ of TO/W (32 mN/m) is much lower than DD/W (52 mN/m) or A/W (72 mN/m). At lower concentrations, the γ-time curves (Fig. 1) showed a discontinuity in the lag period. Fo"
