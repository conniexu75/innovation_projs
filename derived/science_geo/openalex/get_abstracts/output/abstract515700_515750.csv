The hematopoietic system is at the forefront of cell-based gene therapies due to the fact that the cells can be readily obtained, manipulated, and reintroduced into patients. The development of genome editing methodologies such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (Urnov et al., 2010Urnov F.D. Rebar E.J. Holmes M.C. Zhang H.S. Gregory P.D. Genome editing with engineered zinc finger nucleases.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar);(Joung and Sander, 2013Joung J.K.

Xiao L. Li A.S. Zhang X. Sirois P. Zhang J. Li K. Biological and biomedical applications of engineered nucleases.Mol. Biotechnol. 2013; 55: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite much promise, limitations associated with these technologies, including low targeting efficacy and de novo engineering of proteins for each target, have precluded wide-spread adoption of these technologies for therapeutic use (Silva et al., 2011Silva G. Poirot L. Galetto R. Smith J. Montoya G. Duchateau P. Pâques F. Meganucleases and other tools for targeted genome engineering: perspectives and challenges for gene therapy.Curr. Gene Ther. 2011; 11: 11-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The recent emergence of the clustered, regularly interspaced, palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system for gene editing has the potential to overcome these limitations (Jinek et al., 2012Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.Science. 2012; 337: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (9330) Google Scholar). The CRISPR technology utilizes a fixed nuclease, often the CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) from Streptococcus pyogenes, in combination with a short guide RNA (gRNA) to target the nuclease to a specific DNA sequence (Cong et al., 2013Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W. Marraffini L.A. Zhang F.

CRISPR/Cas9 relies on simple base-pairing rules between the target DNA and the engineered gRNA rather than protein-DNA interactions required by ZFNs and TALENs (Gaj et al., 2013Gaj T. Gersbach C.A.

As a result, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has proven extremely simple and flexible. Perhaps most important, this system has achieved highly efficacious alteration of the genome in a number of cell types and organisms (Ding et al., 2013Ding Q. Regan S.N. Xia Y. Oostrom L.A.

Given the importance of the hematopoietic system in cell-based gene therapies, we tested the CRISPR/Cas9 system in primary human CD4+ T cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) targeting two clinically relevant genes, beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). B2M encodes the accessory chain of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and is required for their surface expression (Bjorkman et al., 1987Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C.

Deletion of B2M is a well-established strategy to ablate MHC class I surface expression (Riolobos et al., 2013Riolobos L. Hirata R.K. Turtle C.J. Wang P.R. Gornalusse G.G. Zavajlevski M. Riddell S.R.

Ther. 2013; 21: 1232-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and could be used to generate hypoimmunogenic cells for transplantation and adoptive immunotherapy. CCR5 is the main coreceptor used by CCR5-tropic strains of HIV-1 (Trkola et al., 1996Trkola A. Dragic T. Arthos J. Binley J.M. Olson W.C. Allaway G.P. Cheng-Mayer C. Robinson J. Maddon P.J.

CD4-dependent, antibody-sensitive interactions between HIV-1 and its co-receptor CCR-5.Nature. 1996; 384: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) and a validated target for gene ablation, as mutations resulting in loss of protein expression or haploinsufficiency protect against HIV infection (Catano et al., 2011Catano G.

Moreover, transplantation of CCR5 homozygous mutant HSPCs provides long-term protection against HIV rebound even after discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (Allers et al., 2011Allers K. Hütter G. Hofmann J. Loddenkemper C. Rieger K. Thiel E. Schneider T.

Biol. 2011; 18: 1189-1198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), though the efficiency of gene targeting was not sufficient to protect against viral recrudescence (Tebas et al., 2014Tebas P. Stein D. Tang W.W. Frank I. Wang S.Q. Lee G. Spratt S.K. Surosky R.T. Giedlin M.A. Nichol G. et al.Gene editing of CCR5 in autologous CD4 T cells of persons infected with HIV.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 370: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Recently, CCR5 has been targeted using CRISPR/Cas9 in cell lines (Cho et al., 2013Cho S.W. Kim S. Kim J.M. Kim J.S. Targeted genome engineering in human cells with the Cas9 RNA-guided endonuclease.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar) and iPS cells (Ye et al., 2014Ye L. Wang J. Beyer A.I. Teque F. Cradick T.J. Qi Z. Chang J.C. Bao G. Muench M.O. Yu J. et al.Seamless modification of wild-type induced pluripotent stem cells to the natural CCR5Δ32 mutation confers resistance to HIV infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9591-9596Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in primary human hematopoietic cells remains untested. Here we report that use of CRISPR/Cas9 with single gRNAs led to highly efficient CCR5 ablation in CD34+ HSPCs but not B2M in CD4+ T cells. Employing a dual gRNA approach improved gene deletion efficacy in both cell types with biallelic inactivation frequencies reaching 34% for B2M in CD4+ T cells and 42% for CCR5 in CD34+ HSPCs. Importantly, CRISPR/Cas9 CCR5-edited CD34+ HSPCs retained multilineage potential in vitro and in vivo upon xenotransplantation. Deep target capture sequencing of predicted on- and off-target sites in CD34+ HSPCs revealed highly efficacious on-target mutagenesis and exceedingly low off-target mutagenesis. We designed gRNAs to target Cas9 to the B2M gene (Figure 1A). Each guide was first tested for the ability to direct site-specific mutations in HEK293T cells. Using flow cytometry we measured the efficiency of each gRNA to direct Cas9-mediated ablation of B2M surface expression 72 hr posttransfection (Figure 1B). We observed that B2M was abrogated in ∼7% (±1.02 SEM, n = 3) to 48% (±1.80 SEM, n = 3) of HEK293T cells depending upon the gRNA utilized (Figure 1C; Figure S1A available online). Similar results were observed using the Surveyor assay, with gRNA-specific mutation frequencies of 0%–26% in HEK293T cells (Figure S1B). We also designed gRNAs to target Cas9 to the CCR5 gene (Figure 1D). Upon introducing these into K562 cells, we measured targeting efficacy using the Surveyor assay and observed mutation frequencies ranging from 22%–40% (Figure 1E). Variation in the efficiency with which a specific gRNA directed Cas9-mediated ablation was observed, even between gRNAs targeting the same exon or nearly overlapping sites (Figures 1A–1E) indicating that on-target efficiency of site-directed mutation is highly gRNA dependent, as previously noted (Hsu et al., 2013Hsu P.D. Scott D.A. Weinstein J.A. Ran F.A. Konermann S. Agarwala V. Li Y. Fine E.J. Wu X. Shalem O. et al.DNA targeting specificity of RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). Next, we tested selected single gRNAs in CD4+ T cells and CD34+ HSPCs. Surprisingly, gRNAs that were highly efficacious at targeting B2M in HEK293T cells exhibited lower targeting efficiencies in primary CD4+ T cells ranging from 1.4% (±0.2 SEM, n = 6) to 4.7% (±0.9 SEM, n = 6) ablation of B2M expression (Figures 1F, S1C, and S1D) or 3%–11% using the Surveyor assay (Figures S1B and S1E). For instance, crB2M_13 exhibited more than 10-fold reduced efficacy in CD4+ T cells (4.7% ± 0.9%) as compared to HEK293T cells (48.0% ± 1.8%) (Figures 1F and S1C). Interestingly, single gRNAs targeting CCR5 showed comparable mutation frequencies in CD34+ HSPCs as observed in K562 cells (Figures 1E and 1G). To explore this further, we performed direct Sanger sequencing of several hundred colonies derived from HSPC clones targeted with crCCR5_A or crCCR5_B from two donors and observed very high mutation frequencies in all cases (Figure 1H). As only cells expressing Cas9 were analyzed, it is unlikely that differences in on-target mutation efficiency were due to differential transfection efficiencies, although we cannot rule out differential transfection of individual guides, but rather may reflect intrinsic properties of certain primary hematopoietic cell types. We reasoned that using two gRNAs directed against the same locus might generate predictable mutations (deletions) more frequently than that achieved by error-prone non-homologous end joining, which represents the predominant DNA double strand break repair pathway in HSPCs (Beerman et al., 2014Beerman I. Seita J. Inlay M.A. Weissman I.L. Rossi D.J. Quiescent hematopoietic stem cells accumulate DNA damage during aging that is repaired upon entry into cell cycle.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 37-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Indeed, this approach has previously been utilized for ZFNs, TALENs, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system to achieve predictable deletions (Bauer et al., 2013Bauer D.E. Kamran S.C. Lessard S. Xu J. Fujiwara Y.

Dual sgRNAs facilitate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mouse genome targeting.FEBS J. 2014; 281: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Six dual gRNA combinations targeting B2M with DNA sequence lengths between their predicted Cas9 cleavage sites ranging from 81 to 2,261 nt were introduced in CD4+ T cells together with Cas9 (Figure 2A). We observed a trend of improved targeting efficacy for most of the tested gRNA pairs and greatly improved efficacy for one gRNA pair (crB2M_13+8), which resulted in 18.0% (±8.35 SEM, n = 3) ablation of B2M surface expression (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2A). B2M ablation led to a concomitant reduction of MHC class I cell surface expression (Figure S2B). We further interrogated mutation frequency at a clonal level via single-cell quantitative PCR, which revealed 28.2% (n = 301 cells analyzed) of CD4+ T cells were homozygous null for B2M (Figure S2C). Upon Sanger sequencing across the predicted Cas9 cutting sites, we observed deletion of the intervening sequence (Figure S2D). We next applied the dual guide strategy to primary CD34+ HSPCs by introducing three gRNA pairs along with Cas9 (Figure 2D). Sorted CD34+ HSPCs expressing Cas9 were plated into methylcellulose and emergent clonal colonies were picked 2 weeks postplating for analysis. Individual colonies were analyzed by PCR to quantify the deletion efficacy of CCR5 (Figures 2D and 2E). Remarkably, although variation in CCR5 ablation was noted among different donors and gRNA pairs, we consistently observed high monoallelic and biallelic inactivation of CCR5 in all cases (Figures 2E and S2E). For example, one dual gRNA combination (crCCR5_D+Q) generated biallelic CCR5 deletion in CD34+ HSPCs at a rate of 26.8% (±7.1 SEM) across four donors (Figures 2E and S2E). It should be noted, however, that the mutation rates determined by this PCR strategy underestimate actual mutation frequency, since small insertions or deletions (InDels) are not detected by this approach. A similar dual gRNA approach targeting CCR5 (crCCR5_A+B) in CD4+ T cells resulted in a biallelic inactivation rate of 8.8% at the single-cell level (n = 363) (Figure S2F). Again, after Sanger sequencing, we noted excision of the DNA between the Cas9 cleavage sites (Figure S2G). Taken together, these data demonstrate that highly efficacious ablation of clinically relevant genes can be achieved in primary hematopoietic CD4+ T cells and CD34+ HSPCs using a dual gRNA strategy. In order to determine whether CD34+ HSPCs that had undergone genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 retained their potential to differentiate into effector cells, we performed in vitro and in vivo differentiation assays. Toward this, CCR5-edited CD34+ HSPCs were plated in methylcellulose and clonal colonies that emerged 2 weeks postplating were counted and scored for contribution to granulocyte, macrophage, erythrocyte, and megakaryocyte lineages. Comparable colony numbers and colony types were observed regardless of whether single, dual, or no gRNAs were used demonstrating that CD34+ HSPC colony forming potential was not impacted by CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure 3A), despite the high CCR5 mutation frequencies observed in these experiments (Figures 1H and 2E). We next tested the in vivo reconstitution potential of HSPCs following CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of CCR5 by xenotransplantation of control (Cas9-only), and CCR5-edited (Cas9 + crCCR5 D+Q) CD34+ HSPCs into NOD-PrkdcScid-IL2rγnull (NSG) recipients. Recipients were sacrificed at 12 weeks posttransplantation, and human hematopoietic cell engraftment (hCD45+) was examined in the bone marrow, revealing CD19+ lymphoid cells and CD11b+ myeloid cells (Figure 3B). Human CD45+ hematopoietic cells were also found in the spleens of transplanted mice (Figure 3C). PCR analysis on DNA isolated from sorted human CD45+ hematopoietic cells from reconstituted mice demonstrated that CCR5-edited cells (ΔCCR5) robustly contributed to human hematopoietic cell chimerism (Figure 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 CCR5-edited CD34+ HSPCs retained multilineage potential in vitro and in vivo. CRISPR/Cas9 has been shown to generate off-target mutations depending upon experimental setting and cell type (Cho et al., 2014Cho S.W. Kim S. Kim Y. Kweon J. Kim H.S. Bae S. Kim J.S.

To examine this, we performed target capture sequencing of CD34+ HSPCs subjected to CRISPR/Cas9 CCR5 editing. These experiments captured each gRNA target site (n = 5) and predicted off-target sites (n = 126) with expanded capture intervals of 500 bp flanking each site to ensure accurate detection of any genetic lesion occurring at or near the selected sites (Figure 4A; Table S1). We have previously shown this approach can identify structural variations, such as translocations and inversions, in proximity to the capture site (Talkowski et al., 2011Talkowski M.E. Ernst C. Heilbut A. Chiang C. Hanscom C. Lindgren A. Kirby A. Liu S. Muddukrishna B.

Genet. 2011; 88: 469-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Sorted CD34+ HSPCs treated with Cas9 alone or in combination with multiple single or dual gRNA combinations were sequenced to a mean target coverage of 3,390X across each 23 bp gRNA sequence and PAM (Figure 4B). Analysis of these data revealed highly efficacious on-target mutagenesis with a diverse array of mutated sequence variants observed in both single and dual gRNA treatments (Figure 4C). As expected, we detected small InDels of up to 10 bp in addition to single nucleotide substitutions at the predicted target sites in single gRNA conditions. Strikingly, in each dual gRNA experiment, no fewer than 15 alternate mutant alleles were observed at either one of the gRNA sites (Tables S2–S4). Notably, the sequencing depth of our analysis permitted estimation of mutation frequency for each particular variant, including mutations that were observed in only a few hundredths of a percent of the sample sequenced (Table S5). Predicted deletions (i.e., deletions between the two Cas9 target sites) were the most common mutations observed, while small InDels were also frequent (Figure 4C). Interestingly, for two combinations, crCCR5_A+B and crCCR5_D+Q, we also observed inversions between the predicted Cas9 cleavage sites. The most efficacious combination crCCR5_D+Q led to mutations in approximately 48% of the captured sequence reads. We next examined the capture sequence reads at predicted off-target sites in the genome (Table S1). An N-fold enrichment analysis was performed, wherein we compared the total number of non-reference sequencing reads at each predicted off-target site in gRNA-treated and control (Cas9 only) samples. This analysis generated a ratio where 1.0 indicates an equivalent number of nonreference sequence reads in both treated and control samples, values less than 1.0 indicate fewer non-reference reads in treated samples, and values greater than 1.0 indicate a greater number of non-reference reads in treated samples (Figure 4D). This analysis found that the mean enrichment of mutations at off-target sites in all the gRNA-treated samples compared to control closely conformed to the null hypothesis (i.e., 0.99-fold enrichment compared to controls), indicating that off-target mutation events were extremely rare. Indeed, statistical evaluation of all captured off-target sites yielded a single site (1/126; 0.6%, Figure 4D) in the sample treated with crCCR5_B alone that passed multiple test correction for a statistically significant enrichment for off-target InDels versus controls (p ≤ 7.6 × 10−11) (Table S5). When we scrutinized the sequencing reads from this site, which was located in the highly homologous CCR2 gene (Figure S3A), we found that all sequence variants (36 out of 5,963 total reads) were one or two base InDels, (Figure S3B). Of note, the other sample in which crCCR5_B was used (in combination with crCCR5_A) only 13 out of 5,339 reads supported mutation; however, these events did not meet statistical significance above controls (Figure S3B; Table S5). Thus, off-target mutagenesis was exceedingly rare and, moreover, the use of two gRNAs in combination did not increase the very low incidence of off-target mutagenesis. We also performed analyses for structural variation at all sites, and though we could readily detect on-target inversions in crCCR5_A+B and crCCR5_D+Q treatments, there was no evidence for inversion or translocation at any off-target sites. These data indicate that on-target mutagenesis efficiency was very high and further that off-target mutagenesis was extremely infrequent for both single and dual gRNA treatments. In this study we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system in human primary CD4+ T cells and CD34+ HSPCs to target two clinically relevant genes B2M and CCR5. Surprisingly, the activity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system was remarkably variable in different human cell types, with the same gRNA exhibiting highly efficacious on target mutagenic activity in HEK293T cells but little activity in CD4+ T cells. In contrast, the targeting eff"

Cell replacement therapy in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is based on the premise that transplanted midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons can restore dopaminergic neurotransmission when transplanted to the DA-depleted striatum, providing a functionally efficient substitute for the neurons that are lost in the disease. Clinical trials using cells derived from human fetal ventral mesencephalon (VM) have shown that transplanted DA neurons can functionally reinnervate the denervated striatum, restore DA release, and at least in some PD patients, provide substantial long-term clinical improvement (Barker et al., 2013Barker R.A.

However, the use of tissue from aborted human embryos presents several ethical and logistical issues that hamper the effective translation of fetal tissue transplantation as a realistic therapeutic option. In order to move to large-scale clinical applications, a readily available, renewable, and bankable source of cells with the potential to differentiate into fully functional DA neurons after transplantation is an absolute requirement. Among the different stem cell sources available, human pluripotent stem cells, in particular human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), have advanced the furthest (Lindvall and Kokaia, 2009Lindvall O.

Using protocols entirely based on extrinsic patterning cues that mimic fetal midbrain development, it is now possible to generate DA neurons with an authentic midbrain phenotype from human pluripotent stem cells that survive transplantation and that can restore motor deficits in animal models of PD (Doi et al., 2014Doi D.

However, a number of crucial issues need to be addressed in preclinical studies before these cells can be considered for clinical use: it is important to verify that their functional efficacy is robust, reproducible, and stable over significant time periods; that the transplanted cells have the capacity to grow axons and reinnervate the DA-denervated host striatum over distances that are relevant for the size of the human brain; and that they function with equal potency to human fetal VM DA neurons that have previously been used in clinical trials (Barker, 2014Barker R.A. Developing Stem Cell Therapies for Parkinson’s Disease: Waiting Until the Time is Right.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15 (this issue): 539-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we have performed a rigorous preclinical assessment of long-term in vivo functionality and axonal outgrowth capacity of hESC-derived midbrain DA neurons, critical for their translation to the clinic. We show long-term survival and functionality using clinically relevant MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging techniques and efficacy in restoration of motor function that is comparable to that seen with human fetal cells. Importantly, we provide a direct comparison of human DA neurons sourced from either hESCs or fetal VM and show that hESC-derived neurons, like their fetal counterparts, can project over long distances in the lesioned adult rodent brain and regenerate axonal projections with cell-type specific innervation of correct target structures. These data represent an important milestone in the preclinical assessment of hESC-derived DA neurons and provide essential support for their usefulness in cell replacement therapy for PD. First, we wanted to assess long-term survival and function of grafted cells using methodologies that are used in the clinic. We therefore transplanted hESC-derived DA (hESC-DA) neurons to the striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned athymic, adult rats, allowing for long-term graft survival in the absence of immunosuppressive treatment. The grafted animals were followed up to 6 months after transplantation, the point at which grafts of fetal VM in patients start to become functional (Piccini et al., 2000Piccini P. Lindvall O. Björklund A. Brundin P. Hagell P. Ceravolo R. Oertel W. Quinn N. Samuel M. Rehncrona S. et al.Delayed recovery of movement-related cortical function in Parkinson’s disease after striatal dopaminergic grafts.Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). T2-weighed MRI imaging showed surviving transplants that increased in volume from 1 to 5 months posttransplantation, indicating initial proliferation and subsequent maturation of the transplanted cells (Figure S1A available online), as previously described for transplants of proliferative midbrain progenitors (Kirkeby et al., 2012aKirkeby A. Grealish S. Wolf D.A. Nelander J. Wood J. Lundblad M. Lindvall O. Parmar M. Generation of regionally specified neural progenitors and functional neurons from human embryonic stem cells under defined conditions.. 2012; 1: 703-714Google Scholar). MR spectroscopy investigation 5 months postgrafting revealed a high N-acetylaspartic acid content within the transplanted area, indicative of a neuron-rich graft (Figures S1B and S1C). Pretransplantation, the rats were assessed for deficits in striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission by PET, using 18F-fallypride as a measure of D2/D3-receptor occupancy (Moon et al., 2010Moon B.S. Park J.H. Lee H.J. Kim J.S. Kil H.S. Lee B.S. Chi D.Y. Lee B.C. Kim Y.K. Kim S.E. Highly efficient production of [(18)F]fallypride using small amounts of base concentration.Appl. Radiat. Isot. 2010; 68: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and 18F-LBT999 as a tracer for the dopamine transporter (DAT) (Dollé et al., 2007Dollé F. Helfenbein J. Hinnen F. Mavel S. Mincheva Z. Saba W. Schöllhorn Peyronneau M.A. Valette H. Garreau L. Chalon S. et al.One-step radiosynthesis of [18F]LBT-999: a selective radioligand for the visualization of the dopamine transporter with PET.J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. 2007; 50: 716-723Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). In the 6-OHDA-lesioned DA-denervated striatum 18F-fallypride binding was significantly increased, as compared with the intact hemisphere, signifying a pronounced reduction in DA release. After grafting, 18F-fallypride binding was normalized to intact levels as assessed 5 months posttransplantation, indicative of active DA release from the transplanted hESC-DA neurons (Figures 1A and 1B). Similarly, the near-complete loss of DAT binding, using 18F-LBT999, seen after 6-OHDA lesion was reversed to around 50% of normal (Figures 1A and 1C). 18F-DPA714 binding was used to measure microglial activation (Kuhnast et al., 2012Kuhnast B. Damont A. Hinnen F. Catarina T. Demphel S. Le Helleix S. Coulon C. Goutal S. Gervais P. Dollé F.

Isot. 2012; 70: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and no increase was observed at 5 months postgrafting, relative to the nontransplanted side (Figure 1A). Histological analysis confirmed the imaging data, showing neuron-rich transplants and revealing grafts rich in DA neurons, expressing both tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT), in the absence of a notable active microglial (Iba1+) response, overgrowths, or necrotic areas (Figures S2A–S2C). To assess graft-derived axonal outgrowth we made use of an antibody specific for human neural cell adhesion molecule (hNCAM) (Figures 1D–1G), allowing selective and highly sensitive visualization of the grafted neurons and their projections. Dense hNCAM+ innervation was observed throughout the caudate-putamen, including the dorsolateral striatum, which derives its innervation exclusively from the A9 neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) (Figure 1D). Similar innervation was also observed in other forebrain DA target areas outside the caudate-putamen, such as nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Figure 1E), olfactory tubercle (Figure 1D), and the perirhinal and prelimbic cortices (Figures 1F and 1G), which are essential targets for the A10 neuronal subtype, residing in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Figures S2D and S2E). Taken together, these data prove the ability of hESC-DA neurons to provide extensive reinnervation of the host striatum and begin to restore DAergic neurotransmission 5 months posttransplantation, using clinically relevant methods to assess graft function, in the absence of significant adverse events. This is in line with previous clinical observations using human fetal VM grafted to patients, where progressive recovery of DA neurotransmission starts at 6 months, reflecting the gradual maturation of the transplanted cells (Piccini et al., 1999Piccini P. Brooks D.J. Björklund A. Gunn R.N. Grasby P.M. Rimoldi O. Brundin P. Hagell P. Rehncrona S. Widner H. Lindvall O.

Neurol. 2000; 48: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that hESC-DA neurons can release DA in vivo (Kirkeby et al., 2012aKirkeby A. Grealish S.

However, these transplants contained 15,000–18,000 hESC-derived DA neurons, and the high cell number makes it difficult to estimate the efficacy of the cells (Barker, 2014Barker R.A. Developing Stem Cell Therapies for Parkinson’s Disease: Waiting Until the Time is Right.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15 (this issue): 539-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In previous preclinical and experimental studies using grafts of human fetal VM, it has been shown that normalization of amphetamine-induced rotation after intrastriatal transplantation can be achieved with an average number of 1,200 surviving TH+ neurons (Brundin et al., 1986Brundin P. Nilsson O.G. Strecker R.E. Lindvall O. Astedt B. Björklund A. Behavioural effects of human fetal dopamine neurons grafted in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease.Exp. Brain Res. 1986; 65: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). On the basis of this information, we performed a potency experiment designed to determine the minimal number of hESC-DA neurons capable of inducing functional recovery in the amphetamine-induced rotation test. We transplanted 6-OHDA lesioned rats, aiming for at least a 10-fold lower number of hESC-DA than the grafts functionally assessed in earlier studies (Kirkeby et al., 2012aKirkeby A. Grealish S. Wolf D.A. Nelander J. Wood J. Lundblad M. Lindvall O. Parmar M.

Buch A. et al.Dopamine neurons derived from human ES cells efficiently engraft in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.Nature. 2011; 480: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The rats were pretested to confirm the completeness of the lesion and immunosuppressed with daily injections of ciclosporin for 18 weeks. At this time point, the rats showed a significant recovery in amphetamine-induced rotation (Figure 2A: t4 = 6.76, p < 0.01; n = 5), despite a much lower number of TH+ neurons in the grafts (Figures 2B and 2C). Quantifications showed that the average number of surviving TH+ neurons was 986 ± 333 per rat (n = 5). Two of the rats had less than 500 surviving hESC-DA neurons and yet showed a complete reduction in rotational bias (Figure 2B). Within TRANSERUO, a EU-funded research consortium formed to develop an efficacious and safe treatment methodology for PD using fetal cell based treatments (http://www.transeuro.org.uk), research groups including our own have optimized and standardized tissue preparation protocols across several centers throughout Europe. A recent report with cells prepared using this protocol show that a significant reduction in amphetamine-induced rotation could be achieved with transplants of human fetal VM with as few 657 ± 199 surviving TH+ neurons (Rath et al., 2013Rath A. Klein A. Papazoglou A. Pruszak J. Garcia J. Krause M. Maciaczyk J. Dunnett S.B. Nikkhah G. Survival and functional restoration of human fetal ventral mesencephalon following transplantation in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease.Cell Transplant. 2013; 22: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the functional potency of grafted hESC-DA neurons is on par with that of human DA neurons obtained from fetal VM (Brundin et al., 1986Brundin P. Nilsson O.G. Strecker R.E.

We next performed a direct histological comparison between hESC-DA neurons and authentic human fetal DA neurons prepared according to Rath et al., 2013Rath A. Klein A. Papazoglou A. Pruszak J.

In this analysis, we observed the presence of TH+ neurons with two distinct morphologies in the hESC-grafted animals (Mendez et al., 2005Mendez I. Sanchez-Pernaute R. Cooper O. Viñuela A. Ferrari D. Björklund L. Dagher A. Isacson O.

The morphology of the hESC-derived neurons was identical to that observed with intrastriatal transplants of fetal VM when analyzed at 6 months posttransplantation (Figure 3C) and consistent with graft appearance from previous postmortem reports from transplanted PD patients (Mendez et al., 2005Mendez I. Sanchez-Pernaute R. Cooper O. Viñuela A. Ferrari D. Björklund L. Dagher A. Isacson O. Cell type analysis of functional fetal dopamine cell suspension transplants in the striatum and substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson’s disease.Brain. 2005; 128: 1498-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). When staining the cells for markers commonly used to distinguish between SN (A9) and VTA (A10) neurons, TH+ neurons expressing GIRK2 (A9), Calbindin (A10), or both markers were readily detected (Figures 3B and 3D). Quantifications showed that TH+/GIRK2+ neurons were the most abundant subtype in both hESC-derived and fetal grafts (Figure 3I) and that the proportion was similar in both hESC- and fetal-derived grafts (Figure 3J). Taken together, this analysis shows that hESC-DA neurons are indistinguishable from their fetal counterparts on the basis of graft appearance, morphology, and marker expression 6 months after grafting and that the hESC-derived grafts are rich in both A9-like and A10-like DA neurons. When assessing the cells for their suitability to be used in clinical trials, it is important to keep in mind that the human brain is a much larger structure than the rodent brain and that it is necessary for the transplanted cells to extend axons over long distances in order to sufficiently reinnervate the putamen in patients. We therefore sought to create an assay through which long-distance, target-specific outgrowth could be assessed in an adult rodent model of PD that would be predictive when translating to the larger human brain. Intrastriatal grafting, the standard used in preclinical and clinical studies, places the cells within their main target structure, thus making it difficult to assess the full innervation capacity of human cells when grafted to the rat brain. To investigate the ability of hESC-DA neurons to innervate specific structures across longer distances, we employed a homotopic grafting approach where we transplanted hESC-DA neurons into the lesioned SN, instead of the traditional ectopic placement in the striatum. Transplants of fetal VM served as an important reference to see if hESC-derived neurons could match their capacity for long-distance and target-specific innervation. When grafted to the SN, both hESCs and fetal VM gave rise to grafts rich in TH+ neurons expressing GIRK2 and Calbindin with morphologies indistinguishable from cells grafted to the striatum (compare Figures 3E–3H with Figures 3A–3D). In the majority of rats with fetal VM transplants (n = 7/8), we observed neuron-rich grafts, discretely placed within the host SN, extending large numbers of hNCAM+ axons rostral along the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) and the adjacent nigrostriatal pathway, assembled in a well-defined and fasciculated tract (Figures 4A, 4G, 4I, S3A, and S3B). Rostral extending axonal bundles were seen to defasciculate and ramify within their terminal target fields, providing widespread innervation of specific host structures throughout the forebrain (Figure 4A), extending more than 10 mm from the graft core. hNCAM+ terminal innervation was particularly dense in caudate-putamen (Figure 4C), NAc (Figure 4D), amygdala (Figure 4B), and perirhinal and anteromedial frontal cortices (Figures 4A and 4E). Notably, graft-derived hNCAM+ glial cells were detected in the transplants derived from the 8-week-old fetus (Figures 4F and 4G), but not from the younger 5.5-week-old fetus (Figures 4H and 4I). In the grafts of 8-week fetal VM, the graft-derived glial cells could be traced along myelinated and nonmyelinated fiber tracts, accompanying the hNCAM+ axons up to the level of the caudal caudate-putamen (Figure 4G), as described in previous xenografting studies (Gates et al., 1998Gates M.A. Olsson M.

The fate of human glial cells following transplantation in normal rodents and rodent models of neurodegenerative disease.Brain Res. 1995; 695: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of graft-derived glia in the transplants of the younger embryo (Figure 4H), hNCAM+ fiber outgrowth was comparable to grafts derived from older tissue (Figures S3B–S3G). This observation indicates that the extent and patterning of axonal outgrowth is largely independent of this glial population present within the transplant. Six months posttransplantation we observed robust survival in all hESC grafted animals (n = 8/8), with no signs of overgrowth or necrosis, similar in morphology to the intrastriatal grafts of hESC-DA neurons described above (Figures 1, 2D, and S2A–S2C). As observed with intranigral transplants of fetal VM, large numbers of hNCAM+ fibers projected rostral along the MFB and the adjacent nigrostriatal pathway (Figures 5A, 5F, S4A, and S4B). The axons extending along the MFB continued a distance more than 10 mm from the graft core and gave rise to dense terminal networks in amygdala (Figure 5B); dorsolateral striatum (Figure 5C) and piriform cortex; ventral striatum, including NAc (Figure 5D); olfactory tubercle; lateral septum; and large parts of the frontal lobe (Figures 5A, 5E, and 5G). hNCAM+ cells with a glial morphology were not detected in any of the hESC-grafted rats, consistent with our hypothesis that they are not essential for extensive axonal outgrowth. Although A9 and A10 midbrain DA neuron subtypes can be arbitrarily distinguished on the basis of morphology and GIRK2/Calbindin protein expression, true identification of the subtype is linked to the ability of the neurons to innervate their appropriate forebrain targets: the A9 preferentially innervating the caudate-putamen and A10 neurons innervating limbic and cortical areas, including ventral striatum and NAc. To determine the presence of authentic A9 or A10 subtypes in grafts of fetal VM and hESC-DA neurons, we performed quantitative fiber density measurements (Figures S5A and S5B) of human hNCAM+ axons (Figure 6C) in defined striatal areas (A9 targets), as well as limbic and cortical areas (A10 targets), as depicted in Figure S5C.We found that the number of axons projecting rostral was similar in the VM (2,169 ± 181; n = 3) and hESC (2,453 ± 774; n = 4) groups. Overall, the fiber density measurements showed that the midbrain-patterned hESCs exhibited the same A9/A10 target specificity and axonal outgrowth patterns as human fetal VM cells. Both fetal VM- and hESC-derived neurons innervated the caudate-putamen, which in the rat is targeted almost exclusively by A9 neurons, but that fetal VM tissue was more efficient at innervating the dorsolateral caudate-putamen (Figure 6A: dorsomedial, t25 = 2.69, p < 0.01; dorsolateral, t25 = 4.38, p < 0.0001; Medial, t25 = 2.14, p < 0.05). All A10-specific target structures were innervated at similar densities by fetal VM and hESCs, with the exception of the infralimbic cortex and septum, which received a more pronounced innervation from the hESC grafts (Figure 6B: ILC, t25 = 5.99, p < 0.0001; Sept, t25 = 5.32, p < 0.0001). In order to identify the specific contribution from grafted DA neurons, we utilized immunofluorescence to detect human axons coexpressing TH and hNCAM (Figure 6F). Performing fiber density counts on double-positive fibers; we again found that fetal- and hESC-derived DA neurons demonstrated a similar propensity to innervate A9 and A10 specific striatal target structures (Figures 6D and 6E), although A9-specific innervation derived from fetal VM grafts was overall of higher density (Figure 6D: dorsomedial, t4 = 2.27, p < 0.05; dorsolateral, t4 = 4.15, p < 0.01). In summary, midbrain-patterned hESCs exhibited the same remarkable ability as their fetal counterparts to extend axons over long distances and provide specific innervation of the relevant A9 and A10 host target structures.

https://openalex.org/W2078215784,"Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed world, partly because mammals lack the ability to regenerate heart tissue. Whether this is due to evolutionary loss of regenerative mechanisms present in other organisms or to an inability to activate such mechanisms is currently unclear. Here we decipher mechanisms underlying heart regeneration in adult zebrafish and show that the molecular regulators of this response are conserved in mammals. We identified miR-99/100 and Let-7a/c and their protein targets smarca5 and fntb as critical regulators of cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and heart regeneration in zebrafish. Although human and murine adult cardiomyocytes fail to elicit an endogenous regenerative response after myocardial infarction, we show that in vivo manipulation of this molecular machinery in mice results in cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and improved heart functionality after injury. These data provide a proof of concept for identifying and activating conserved molecular programs to regenerate the damaged heart."
https://openalex.org/W2027310774,"Seizure disorders debilitate more than 65,000,000 people worldwide, with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) being the most common form. Previous studies have shown that transplantation of GABA-releasing cells results in suppression of seizures in epileptic mice. Derivation of interneurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has been reported, pointing to clinical translation of quality-controlled human cell sources that can enhance inhibitory drive and restore host circuitry. In this study, we demonstrate that hPSC-derived maturing GABAergic interneurons (mGINs) migrate extensively and integrate into dysfunctional circuitry of the epileptic mouse brain. Using optogenetic approaches, we find that grafted mGINs generate inhibitory postsynaptic responses in host hippocampal neurons. Importantly, even before acquiring full electrophysiological maturation, grafted neurons were capable of suppressing seizures and ameliorating behavioral abnormalities such as cognitive deficits, aggressiveness, and hyperactivity. These results provide support for the potential of hPSC-derived mGIN for restorative cell therapy for epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2078450832,"The recent finding that reprogrammed human pluripotent stem cells can be derived by nuclear transfer into human oocytes as well as by induced expression of defined factors has revitalized the debate on whether one approach might be advantageous over the other. Here we compare the genetic and epigenetic integrity of human nuclear-transfer embryonic stem cell (NT-ESC) lines and isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, derived from the same somatic cell cultures of fetal, neonatal, and adult origin. The two cell types showed similar genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles. Importantly, NT-ESCs and iPSCs had comparable numbers of de novo coding mutations, but significantly more than parthenogenetic ESCs. As iPSCs, NT-ESCs displayed clone- and gene-specific aberrations in DNA methylation and allele-specific expression of imprinted genes. The occurrence of these genetic and epigenetic defects in both NT-ESCs and iPSCs suggests that they are inherent to reprogramming, regardless of derivation approach."
https://openalex.org/W2155012833,"Sustained observations allow for the tracking of change in oceanography and ecosystems, however, these are rare, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere. To address this in part, the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) implemented a network of nine National Reference Stations (NRS). The network builds on one long-term location, where monthly water sampling has been sustained since the 1940s and two others that commenced in the 1950s. In-situ continuously moored sensors and an enhanced monthly water sampling regime now collect more than 50 data streams. Building on sampling for temperature, salinity and nutrients, the network now observes dissolved oxygen, carbon, turbidity, currents, chlorophyll a and both phytoplankton and zooplankton. Additional parameters for studies of ocean acidification and bio-optics are collected at a sub-set of sites and all data is made freely and publically available. Our preliminary results demonstrate increased utility to observe extreme events, such as marine heat waves and coastal flooding; rare events, such as plankton blooms; and have, for the first time, allowed for consistent continental scale sampling and analysis of coastal zooplankton and phytoplankton communities. Independent water sampling allows for cross validation of the deployed sensors for quality control of data that now continuously tracks daily, seasonal and annual variation. The NRS will provide multi-decadal time series, against which more spatially replicated short-term studies can be referenced, models and remote sensing products validated, and improvements made to our understanding of how large-scale, long-term change and variability in the global ocean are affecting Australia's coastal seas and ecosystems. The NRS network provides an example of how a continental scaled observing systems can be developed to collect observations that integrate across physics, chemistry and biology."
https://openalex.org/W2155282054,"The activity patterns of most terrestrial animals are regarded as being primarily influenced by light, although other factors, such as sexual cycle and climatic conditions, can modify the underlying patterns. However, most activity studies have been limited to a single study area, which in turn limit the variability of light conditions and other factors. Here we considered a range of variables that might potentially influence the activity of a large carnivore, the Eurasian lynx, in a network of studies conducted with identical methodology in different areas spanning latitudes from 49°7′N in central Europe to 70°00′N in northern Scandinavia. The variables considered both light conditions, ranging from a day with a complete day–night cycle to polar night and polar day, as well as individual traits of the animals. We analysed activity data of 38 individual free-ranging lynx equipped with GPS-collars with acceleration sensors, covering more than 11,000 lynx days. Mixed linear additive models revealed that the lynx activity level was not influenced by the daily daylight duration and the activity pattern was bimodal, even during polar night and polar day. The duration of the active phase of the activity cycle varied with the widening and narrowing of the photoperiod. Activity varied significantly with moonlight. Among adults, males were more active than females, and subadult lynx were more active than adults. In polar regions, the amplitude of the lynx daily activity pattern was low, likely as a result of the polycyclic activity pattern of their main prey, reindeer. At lower latitudes, the basic lynx activity pattern peaked during twilight, corresponding to the crepuscular activity pattern of the main prey, roe deer. Our results indicated that the basic activity of lynx is independent of light conditions, but is modified by both individual traits and the activity pattern of the locally most important prey."

Well-trained triathletes were split into two groups (NH, n = 14 and HH, n = 13) and completed an 18-d LHTL camp during which they trained at 1100–1200 m and resided at an altitude of 2250 m (PiO2 = 121.7±1.2 vs. 121.4±0.9 mmHg) under either NH (hypoxic chamber; FiO2 15.8±0.8%) or HH (real altitude; barometric pressure 580±23 mmHg) conditions. Oxygen saturations (SpO2) were recorded continuously daily overnight. PiO2 and training loads were matched daily. Before (Pre-) and 1 day after (Post-) LHTL, blood samples, VO2max, and total haemoglobin mass (Hbmass) were measured. A 3-km running test was performed near sea level twice before, and 1, 7, and 21 days following LHTL. During LHTL, hypoxic exposure was lower for the NH group than for the HH group (220 vs. 300 h; P<0.001). Night SpO2 was higher (92.1±0.3 vs. 90.9±0.3%, P<0.001), and breathing frequency was lower in the NH group compared with the HH group (13.9±2.1 vs. 15.5±1.5 breath.min−1, P<0.05). Immediately following LHTL, similar increases in VO2max (6.1±6.8 vs. 5.2±4.8%) and Hbmass (2.6±1.9 vs. 3.4±2.1%) were observed in NH and HH groups, respectively, while 3-km performance was not improved. However, 21 days following the LHTL intervention, 3-km run time was significantly faster in the HH (3.3±3.6%; P<0.05) versus the NH (1.2±2.9%; ns) group. In conclusion, the greater degree of race performance enhancement by day 21 after an 18-d LHTL camp in the HH group was likely induced by a larger hypoxic dose. However, one cannot rule out other factors including differences in sleeping desaturations and breathing patterns, thus suggesting higher hypoxic stimuli in the HH group."
https://openalex.org/W1979688647,"Cresols are present in antiseptics, coal tar, some resins, pesticides, and industrial solvents. Cresol intoxication leads to hepatic injury due to coagulopathy as well as disturbance of hepatic circulation in fatal cases. Patients with uremia suffer from cardiovascular complications, such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, hemolysis, and bleeding, which may be partly due to p-cresol toxicity and its effects on vascular endothelial and mononuclear cells. Given the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation in vascular thrombosis, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of p-cresol on endothelial and mononuclear cells.EA.hy926 (EAHY) endothelial cells and U937 cells were exposed to different concentrations of p-cresol. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and trypan blue dye exclusion technique, respectively. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by propidium iodide flow cytometry. Endothelial cell migration was studied by wound closure assay. ROS level was measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF) fluorescence flow cytometry. Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), and uPA production were determined by Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA).Exposure to 100-500 µM p-cresol decreased EAHY cell number by 30-61%. P-cresol also decreased the viability of U937 mononuclear cells. The inhibition of EAHY and U937 cell growth by p-cresol was related to induction of S-phase cell cycle arrest. Closure of endothelial wounds was inhibited by p-cresol (>100 µM). P-cresol (>50 µM) also stimulated ROS production in U937 cells and EAHY cells but to a lesser extent. Moreover, p-cresol markedly stimulated PAI-1 and suPAR, but not PGF2α, and uPA production in EAHY cells.p-Cresol may contribute to atherosclerosis and thrombosis in patients with uremia and cresol intoxication possibly due to induction of ROS, endothelial/mononuclear cell damage and production of inflammation/atherosclerosis-related molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1983156163,"Understanding vertical and horizontal connectivity is a major priority in research on mesophotic coral ecosystems (30–150 m). However, horizontal connectivity has been the focus of few studies, and data on vertical connectivity are limited to sessile benthic mesophotic organisms. Here we present patterns of vertical and horizontal connectivity in the Hawaiian Islands-Johnston Atoll endemic threespot damselfish, Chromis verater, based on 319 shallow specimens and 153 deep specimens. The mtDNA markers cytochrome b and control region were sequenced to analyze genetic structure: 1) between shallow (<30 m) and mesophotic (30–150 m) populations and 2) across the species' geographic range. Additionally, the nuclear markers rhodopsin and internal transcribed spacer 2 of ribosomal DNA were sequenced to assess connectivity between shallow and mesophotic populations. There was no significant genetic differentiation by depth, indicating high levels of vertical connectivity between shallow and deep aggregates of C. verater. Consequently, shallow and deep samples were combined by location for analyses of horizontal connectivity. We detected low but significant population structure across the Hawaiian Archipelago (overall cytochrome b: ΦST = 0.009, P = 0.020; control region: ΦST = 0.012, P = 0.009) and a larger break between the archipelago and Johnston Atoll (cytochrome b: ΦST = 0.068, P<0.001; control region: ΦST = 0.116, P<0.001). The population structure within the archipelago was driven by samples from the island of Hawaii at the southeast end of the chain and Lisianski in the middle of the archipelago. The lack of vertical genetic structure supports the refugia hypothesis that deep reefs may constitute a population reservoir for species depleted in shallow reef habitats. These findings represent the first connectivity study on a mobile organism that spans shallow and mesophotic depths and provide a reference point for future connectivity studies on mesophotic fishes."
https://openalex.org/W2101244188,"Expert decision making often seems impressive, even miraculous. People with genuine expertise in a particular domain can perform quickly and accurately, and with little information. In the series of experiments presented here, we manipulate the amount of “information” available to a group of experts whose job it is to identify the source of crime scene fingerprints. In Experiment 1, we reduced the amount of information available to experts by inverting fingerprint pairs and adding visual noise. There was no evidence for an inversion effect—experts were just as accurate for inverted prints as they were for upright prints—but expert performance with artificially noisy prints was impressive. In Experiment 2, we separated matching and nonmatching print pairs in time. Experts were conservative, but they were still able to discriminate pairs of fingerprints that were separated by five-seconds, even though the task was quite different from their everyday experience. In Experiment 3, we separated the print pairs further in time to test the long-term memory of experts compared to novices. Long-term recognition memory for experts and novices was the same, with both performing around chance. In Experiment 4, we presented pairs of fingerprints quickly to experts and novices in a matching task. Experts were more accurate than novices, particularly for similar nonmatching pairs, and experts were generally more accurate when they had more time. It is clear that experts can match prints accurately when there is reduced visual information, reduced opportunity for direct comparison, and reduced time to engage in deliberate reasoning. These findings suggest that non-analytic processing accounts for a substantial portion of the variance in expert fingerprint matching accuracy. Our conclusion is at odds with general wisdom in fingerprint identification practice and formal training, and at odds with the claims and explanations that are offered in court during expert testimony."

This study was performed to transfer the proof of concept obtained in mice model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) into human. We designed a pilot study to demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutic vaccination in RA.This was a phase IIa, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adults with RA who previously experienced secondary failure of TNF antagonists. Patients were immunized intramuscularly with 2 or 3 doses of placebo (n = 10) or 90 (n = 6), 180 (n = 12), or 360 µg TNF-K (n = 12). The primary objective was to identify the best dose and schedule based on anti-TNF antibody titers. Clinical symptoms and safety were assessed during 12 months and solicited reactions for 7 days after each injection.The highest anti-TNF antibody response was detected in patients immunized with 360 µg TNF-K and with 3 injections, although this difference was not significant with all other groups. Similar proportions of patients receiving TNF-K and placebo reported adverse events up to month 12. Serious adverse events were reported by 4 patients treated with TNF-K (13.3%) and 3 treated with placebo (30.0%), all unrelated to treatment. At month 12, DAS28-CRP, tender and swollen joint counts, and HAQ scores decreased significantly more in patients who exhibited anti-TNF antibody response than in patients who did not.TNF-K therapeutic vaccination induced dose- and schedule-dependent anti-TNF antibodies in RA patients and was well tolerated. Patients who developed anti-TNF antibodies showed a trend toward clinical improvement. Although the most aggressive dose and schedule, i.e. 360 mg dose administered 3 times, did show a strong trend of higher antibody response, further studies are warranted to examine even higher and more frequent doses in order to establish the best conditions for clinical improvement.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01040715."

Brucella melitensis biovar 3 is mostly involved in human infections and infects mainly small ruminants. Human and animal brucellosis occurrence in the Maghreb seems still underestimated and its epidemiological situation remains hazy. This study summarizes official data, regarding Brucella melitensis infections in Algeria, from 1989 to 2012, with the purpose to provide appropriate insights concerning the epidemiological situation of human and small ruminant brucellosis in Maghreb. Algeria and Europe are closely linked for historical and economical reasons. These historical connections raise the question of their possible impact on the genetic variability of Brucella strains circulating in the Maghreb. Other purpose of this study was to assess the genetic diversity among Maghreb B. melitensis biovar 3 strains, and to investigate their possible epidemiological relationship with European strains, especially with French strains. A total of 90 B. melitensis biovar 3 Maghreb strains isolated over a 25 year-period (1989–2014), mainly from humans, were analysed by MLVA-16. The obtained results were compared with genotypes of European B. melitensis biovar 3 strains. Molecular assays showed that Algerian strains were mainly distributed into two distinct clusters, one Algerian cluster related to European sub-cluster. These results led to suggest the existence of a lineage resulting from socio-historical connections between Algeria and Europe that might have evolved distinctly from the Maghreb autochthonous group. This study provides insights regarding the epidemiological situation of human brucellosis in the Maghreb and is the first molecular investigation regarding B. melitensis biovar 3 strains circulating in the Maghreb."

Cannabidiol is the main non-psychotropic component of the Cannabis sativa with protective and anti-inflammatory properties. However, possible therapeutic effects of cannabidiol on intervertebral disc degeneration have not been investigated yet. The present study investigated the effects of cannabidiol intradiscal injection in the coccygeal intervertebral disc degeneration induced by the needle puncture model using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological analyses. Disc injury was induced in the tail of male Wistar rats via a single needle puncture. The discs selected for injury were punctured percutaneously using a 21-gauge needle. MRI and histological evaluation were employed to assess the results. The effects of intradiscal injection of cannabidiol (30, 60 or 120 nmol) injected immediately after lesion were analyzed acutely (2 days) by MRI. The experimental group that received cannabidiol 120 nmol was resubmitted to MRI examination and then to histological analyses 15 days after lesion/cannabidiol injection. The needle puncture produced a significant disc injury detected both by MRI and histological analyses. Cannabidiol significantly attenuated the effects of disc injury induced by the needle puncture. Considering that cannabidiol presents an extremely safe profile and is currently being used clinically, these results suggest that this compound could be useful in the treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration."

In this study, we investigated stomatal density (SD) and stomatal length (SL) in 150 plant species along an elevation gradient (540–2357 m) in Changbai Mountain, China, and explored the patterns and drivers of stomatal characteristics across species and plant functional types (PFTs: trees, shrubs, and herbs). The average values of SD and SL for all species combined were 156 mm–2 and 35 µm, respectively. SD was higher in trees (224 mm–2) than in shrubs (156 mm–2) or herbs (124 mm–2), and SL was largest in herbs (37 µm). SD was negatively correlated with SL in all species and PFTs (P<0.01). The relationship between stomatal characteristics and elevation differed among PFTs. In trees, SD decreased and SL increased with elevation; in shrubs and herbs, SD initially increased and then decreased. Elevation-related differences in SL were not significant. PFT explained 7.20–17.6% of the total variation in SD and SL; the contributions of CO2 partial pressure (), precipitation, and soil water content (SWC) were weak (0.02–2.28%). Our findings suggest that elevation-related patterns of stomatal characteristics in leaves are primarily a function of PFT, and highlight the importance of differences among PFTs in modeling gas exchange in terrestrial ecosystems under global climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2064745262,"Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is an immunomodulatory cytokine that affects body mass regulation independent of lymphocytes; however, the underlying mechanism(s) involved remains unknown. In an effort to investigate these mechanisms, we performed metabolic cage studies, assessed intestinal bacterial diversity and macronutrient absorption, and examined adipose mitochondrial activity in cultured adipocytes and in lean IL-15 transgenic (IL-15tg), overweight IL-15 deficient (IL-15−/−), and control C57Bl/6 (B6) mice. Here we show that differences in body weight are not the result of differential activity level, food intake, or respiratory exchange ratio. Although intestinal microbiota differences between obese and lean individuals are known to impact macronutrient absorption, differing gut bacteria profiles in these murine strains does not translate to differences in body weight in colonized germ free animals and macronutrient absorption. Due to its contribution to body weight variation, we examined mitochondrial factors and found that IL-15 treatment in cultured adipocytes resulted in increased mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased lipid deposition. Lastly, IL-15tg mice have significantly elevated mitochondrial activity and mass in adipose tissue compared to B6 and IL-15−/− mice. Altogether, these results suggest that IL-15 is involved in adipose tissue regulation and linked to altered mitochondrial function."

Between December 2010 and August 2011, 132 notifications were collected, including 37 outbreaks corresponding to 242 cases (2 to 55 per cluster). Multilocus sequence typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and characterisation of carbapenemase-encoding genes were performed on 110 non-repetitive isolates. Gene blaOXA-23 was the most frequently detected (82%), followed by blaOXA-24 (11%) and blaOXA-58 (7%). Eleven sequence types (ST) were distinguished, among which sequence types ST1, ST2 (64%), ST20, ST25, ST85 and ST107. Isolates from epidemiological clusters had the same ST and resistance genes, indicating probable transmission within centres. In contrast, PFGE types of isolates differed among centres, arguing against transmission among centers. This study provides the first epidemiological snapshot of the population of A. baumannii with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems from France, and further underlines the predominance of international clones."

Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of obesity using standard Chinese criteria based on the body mass index (BMI) and the waist circumference (WC) and to examine the association between obesity and hypertension among middle-aged and elderly people in Jinan city. Methods This cross-sectional study examined 1,870 subjects from the blocks randomly selected from among the 6 communities of Jinan, China in 2011–2012. The Student's t-test was used to compare numerical data, and the χ2 test was used to compare categorical data. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the effects of general and central obesity on hypertension after adjusting for age or for education level, smoking, alcohol consumption, and continuous age. Results The prevalence of general obesity among people age 50 years and older was 21.1% (17.0% for males and 23.1% for females), and the prevalence of central obesity was 77.8% for men and 78.7% for women. For men, compared with a normal BMI, the ORs and 95% CIs for overweight and general obesity were 1.853 (1.252, 2.744) and 3.422 (1.894, 6.182), respectively, after adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol consumption and educational level. Compared with a normal WC, the ORs and 95% CIs for central obesity were 2.334 (1.573, 3.465) and 2.318 (1.544, 3.479), respectively, for men. For women, compared with a normal BMI, the ORs and 95% CIs were 1.942 (1.473, 2.599) and 4.011 (2.817, 5.712), respectively, after adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol consumption and educational level. Compared with a normal WC, the ORs and 95% CIs for central obesity were 2.488 (1.865, 3.319) and 2.379 (1.773, 3.192), respectively, for women. Conclusions The relationship between hypertension and general obesity was stronger than the relationship between hypertension and either overweight or central obesity in both genders."
https://openalex.org/W2038586242,"Long-distance migration is a rare phenomenon in European bats. Genetic analyses and banding studies show that females can cover distances of up to 1,600 km, whereas males are sedentary or migrate only short distances. The onset of this sex-biased migration is supposed to occur shortly after rousing from hibernation and when the females are already pregnant. We therefore predicted that the sexes are exposed to different energetic pressures in early spring, and this should be reflected in their behavior and physiology. We investigated this in one of the three Central European long-distance migrants, the common noctule (Nyctalus noctula) in Southern Germany recording the first individual partial migration tracks of this species. In contrast to our predictions, we found no difference between male and female home range size, activity, habitat use or diet. Males and females emerged from hibernation in similar body condition and mass increase rate was the same in males and females. We followed the first migration steps, up to 475 km, of radio-tagged individuals from an airplane. All females, as well as some of the males, migrated away from the wintering area in the same northeasterly direction. Sex differences in long-distance migratory behavior were confirmed through stable isotope analysis of hair, which showed greater variation in females than in males. We hypothesize that both sexes faced similarly good conditions after hibernation and fattened at maximum rates, thus showing no differences in their local behavior. Interesting results that warrant further investigation are the better initial condition of the females and the highly consistent direction of the first migratory step in this population as summering habitats of the common noctule occur at a broad range in Northern Europe. Only research focused on individual strategies will allow us to fully understand the migratory behavior of European bats."
https://openalex.org/W2109406542,"Anthropomorphism encompasses the attribution of human characteristics to non-living objects. In particular the human tendency to see faces in cars has long been noticed, yet its neural correlates are unknown. We set out to investigate whether the fusiform face area (FFA) is associated with seeing human features in car fronts, or whether, the higher-level theory of mind network (ToM), namely temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) show a link to anthropomorphism. Twenty participants underwent fMRI scanning during a passive car-front viewing task. We extracted brain activity from FFA, TPJ and MPFC. After the fMRI session participants were asked to spontaneously list adjectives that characterize each car front. Five raters judged the degree to which each adjective can be applied as a characteristic of human beings. By means of linear mixed models we found that the implicit tendency to anthropomorphize individual car fronts predicts FFA, but not TPJ or MPFC activity. The results point to an important role of FFA in the phenomenon of ascribing human attributes to non-living objects. Interestingly, brain regions that have been associated with thinking about beliefs and mental states of others (TPJ, MPFC) do not seem to be related to anthropomorphism of car fronts."
https://openalex.org/W2048640100,"An integrated tiered service delivery model (ITSDM) has been proposed to provide 'full-coverage' of CD4 services throughout South Africa. Five tiers are described, defined by testing volumes and number of referring health-facilities. These include: (1) Tier-1/decentralized point-of-care service (POC) in a single site; Tier-2/POC-hub servicing processing < 30-40 samples from 8-10 health-clinics; Tier-3/Community laboratories servicing ∼ 50 health-clinics, processing < 150 samples/day; high-volume centralized laboratories (Tier-4 and Tier-5) processing < 300 or > 600 samples/day and serving > 100 or > 200 health-clinics, respectively. The objective of this study was to establish costs of existing and ITSDM-tiers 1, 2 and 3 in a remote, under-serviced district in South Africa.Historical health-facility workload volumes from the Pixley-ka-Seme district, and the total volumes of CD4 tests performed by the adjacent district referral CD4 laboratories, linked to locations of all referring clinics and related laboratory-to-result turn-around time (LTR-TAT) data, were extracted from the NHLS Corporate-Data-Warehouse for the period April-2012 to March-2013. Tiers were costed separately (as a cost-per-result) including equipment, staffing, reagents and test consumable costs. A one-way sensitivity analyses provided for changes in reagent price, test volumes and personnel time.The lowest cost-per-result was noted for the existing laboratory-based Tiers- 4 and 5 ($6.24 and $5.37 respectively), but with related increased LTR-TAT of > 24-48 hours. Full service coverage with TAT < 6-hours could be achieved with placement of twenty-seven Tier-1/POC or eight Tier-2/POC-hubs, at a cost-per-result of $32.32 and $15.88 respectively. A single district Tier-3 laboratory also ensured 'full service coverage' and < 24 hour LTR-TAT for the district at $7.42 per-test.Implementing a single Tier-3/community laboratory to extend and improve delivery of services in Pixley-ka-Seme, with an estimated local ∼ 12-24-hour LTR-TAT, is ∼ $2 more than existing referred services per-test, but 2-4 fold cheaper than implementing eight Tier-2/POC-hubs or providing twenty-seven Tier-1/POCT CD4 services."
https://openalex.org/W2030065891,"The aim of this study was to examine the ecological plausibility of the “krill surplus” hypothesis and the effects of whaling on the Southern Ocean food web using mass-balance ecosystem modelling. The depletion trajectory and unexploited biomass of each rorqual population in the Antarctic was reconstructed using yearly catch records and a set of species-specific surplus production models. The resulting estimates of the unexploited biomass of Antarctic rorquals were used to construct an Ecopath model of the Southern Ocean food web existing in 1900. The rorqual depletion trajectory was then used in an Ecosim scenario to drive rorqual biomasses and examine the “krill surplus” phenomenon and whaling effects on the food web in the years 1900–2008. An additional suite of Ecosim scenarios reflecting several hypothetical trends in Southern Ocean primary productivity were employed to examine the effect of bottom-up forcing on the documented krill biomass trend. The output of the Ecosim scenarios indicated that while the “krill surplus” hypothesis is a plausible explanation of the biomass trends observed in some penguin and pinniped species in the mid-20th century, the excess krill biomass was most likely eliminated by a rapid decline in primary productivity in the years 1975–1995. Our findings suggest that changes in physical conditions in the Southern Ocean during this time period could have eliminated the ecological effects of rorqual depletion, although the mechanism responsible is currently unknown. Furthermore, a decline in iron bioavailability due to rorqual depletion may have contributed to the rapid decline in overall Southern Ocean productivity during the last quarter of the 20th century. The results of this study underscore the need for further research on historical changes in the roles of top-down and bottom-up forcing in structuring the Southern Ocean food web."
https://openalex.org/W2081287503,"Gender affects performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, and this impact may stem from socio-cultural factors such as gender stereotyping. Here we systematically manipulated gender stereotype messages on a social cognition task on which no initial gender gap has been documented. The outcome reveals: (i) Stereotyping affects both females and males, with a more pronounced impact on females. Yet an explicit negative message for males elicits a striking paradoxical deterioration in performance of females. (ii) Irrespective of gender and directness of message, valence of stereotype message affects performance: negative messages have stronger influence than positive ones. (iii) Directness of stereotype message differentially impacts performance of females and males: females tend to be stronger affected by implicit than explicit negative messages, whereas in males this relationship is opposite. The data are discussed in the light of neural networks underlying gender stereotyping. The findings provide novel insights into the sources of gender related fluctuations in cognition and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2105309379,"Vitamin D is an important hormone in vertebrates. Most animals acquire this hormone through their diet, secondary to exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, or a combination thereof. The objectives for this research were to evaluate the clinical and physiologic effects of artificial UVB light supplementation on guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) and to evaluate the long-term safety of artificial UVB light supplementation over the course of six months. Twelve juvenile acromelanic Hartley guinea pigs were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: Group A was exposed to 12 hours of artificial UVB radiation daily and Group B received only ambient fluorescent light for 12 hours daily. Animals in both groups were offered the same diet and housed under the same conditions. Blood samples were collected every three weeks to measure blood chemistry values, parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OHD3) levels. Serial ophthalmologic examinations, computed tomography scans, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scans were performed during the course of the study. At the end of the study the animals were euthanized and necropsied. Mean ± SD serum 25-OHD3 concentrations differed significantly in the guinea pigs (p<0.0001) between the UVB supplementation group (101.49±21.81 nmol/L) and the control group (36.33±24.42 nmol/L). An increased corneal thickness in both eyes was also found in the UVB supplementation compared to the control group (right eye [OD]: p<0.0001; left eye [OS]: p<0.0001). There were no apparent negative clinical or pathologic side effects noted between the groups. This study found that exposing guinea pigs to UVB radiation long term significantly increased their circulating serum 25-OHD3 levels, and that this increase was sustainable over time. Providing guinea pigs exposure to UVB may be an important husbandry consideration that is not currently recommended."

A group of asymptomatic patients who underwent FDG-PET/CT in the post-therapy surveillance of breast cancer served as the controls. The results were analyzed based on the patients' histological data, other imaging modalities and/or clinical follow-up. Recurrence was defined as evidence of recurrent lesions within 12 months of the FDG-PET/CT scan.Based on elevated serum CA15-3 levels (n = 31) and clinical/radiologic suspicion (n = 40), 71 scans were performed due to suspected recurrence, whereas 69 scans were performed for asymptomatic follow-up. The sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET/CT were 87.5% and 87.1% in the patients with suspected recurrence and 77.8% and 91.7% in the asymptomatic patients. The positive predictive value in the patients with suspected recurrence (mainly due to elevated serum CA 15-3 levels) was higher than that in asymptomatic patients (P = 0.013). Recurrences were proven in 56.3% (40/71) of the patients with suspected recurrence and in 13% (9/69) of the asymptomatic patients (P < 0.001). FDG-PET/CT resulted in changes in the planned management in 49.3% (35/71) of the patients with suspected recurrence and 10.1% (7/69) of the asymptomatic patients (P < 0.001). After follow-up, 77.5% (55/71) of the patients with suspicious recurrences and 97.1% (67/69) of the asymptomatic patients were surviving at the end of the study (P < 0.001).FDG-PET/CT was able to detect recurrence, and the results altered the intended patient management in the post-therapy surveillance of breast cancer. FDG-PET/CT should be used as a priority in patients with increased serum CA 15-3 levels, or with clinical/radiologic suspicion of recurrence, and might be useful for asymptomatic patients."

https://openalex.org/W2050848404,"In order to provide information to better inform management decisions and direct further research, vessel-based visual transects, snorkel transects, and in-water capture techniques were used to characterize hawksbill sea turtles in the shallow marine habitats of a Marine Protected Area (MPA), the Key West National Wildlife Refuge in the Florida Keys. Hawksbills were found in hardbottom and seagrass dominated habitats throughout the Refuge, and on man-made rubble structures in the Northwest Channel near Cottrell Key. Hawksbills captured (N = 82) were exclusively juveniles and subadults with a straight standard carapace length (SSCL) ranging from 21.4 to 69.0cm with a mean of 44.1 cm (SD = 10.8). Somatic growth rates were calculated from 15 recaptured turtles with periods at large ranging from 51 to 1188 days. Mean SSCL growth rate was 7.7 cm/year (SD = 4.6). Juvenile hawksbills (<50 cm SSCL) showed a significantly higher growth rate (9.2 cm/year, SD = 4.5, N = 11) than subadult hawksbills (50–70 cm SSCL, 3.6 cm/year, SD = 0.9, N = 4). Analysis of 740 base pair mitochondrial control region sequences from 50 sampled turtles yielded 12 haplotypes. Haplotype frequencies were significantly different compared to four other Caribbean juvenile foraging aggregations, including one off the Atlantic coast of Florida. Many-to-one mixed stock analysis indicated Mexico as the primary source of juveniles in the region and also suggested that the Refuge may serve as important developmental habitat for the Cuban nesting aggregation. Serum testosterone radioimmunoassay results from 33 individuals indicated a female biased sex ratio of 3.3 females: 1 male for hawksbills in the Refuge. This assemblage of hawksbills is near the northern limit of the species range, and is one of only two such assemblages described in the waters of the continental United States. Since this assemblage resides in an MPA with intensive human use, basic information on the assemblage is vital to resource managers charged with conservation and species protection in the MPA."
https://openalex.org/W2036619489,"The flower buds of Daphne genkwa Sieb. et Zucc. have been used as a traditional Chinese medicine although their functional mechanisms have not been discovered yet. We have studied the potential effects of the plant extracts on natural killer (NK) cell activation, and isolated an active fraction. Genkwadaphnin (GD-1) displayed a potent efficacy to induce IFN-γ transcription in NK cells with concentration- and time-dependent manners. GD-1 treatment triggered the phosphorylation of PKD1, a member of PKC family, MEK and ERK, resulting in IKK activation to induce IκB degradation, and the nuclear localization of p65, an NF-κB subunit, which regulates IFN-γ transcription. GD-1 effect on IFN-γ production was blocked by the addition of Rottlerin, a PKC inhibitor, CID 755673, a PKD inhibitor, or Bay11-7082, an IKKα inhibitor. The nuclear localization of p65 was also inhibited by the kinase inhibitors. Secreted IFN-γ activates STAT1 phosphorylation as autocrine-loops to sustain its secretion. GD-1 induced the phosphorylation of STAT1 probably through the increase of IFN-γ. STAT1 inhibitor also abrogated the sustained IFN-γ secretion. These results suggest that GD-1 is involved in the activation of PKD1 and/or ERK pathway, which activate NK-κB triggering IFN-γ production. As positive feedback loops, secreted IFN-γ activates STAT1 and elongates its production in NK-92 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064657424,"The mobility of ray I was analysed in seventy-eight Early Permian to Late Cretaceous specimens of non-mammalian Synapsida and one extant mammal. In all non-mammaliamorph Synapsida investigated, ray I formed a digital arcade. The first phalanx was maximally extendable to the zero position in the metapodiophalangeal joint I. Metapodiale I was the functional equivalent to a basal phalanx of digits II–V. In contrast, there was no digital arcade in ray I in Mesozoic Mammaliamorpha. Phalanx 1 I was dorsally extendable and metapodiale I was functionally part of the metapodium. During the propulsion phase, autopodial rotation occurred in the majority of Synapsida with abducted limb posture. Regarding ray I, the reduction of autopodial rotation can be estimated, e.g., from the decrease of lateral rotation and medial abduction of the first phalanx in the metapodiophalangeal joint I. Autopodial rotation was high in Titanophoneus and reduced in derived Cynodontia. In Mammaliamorpha the mobility of the first ray suggests autopodial rolling in an approximately anterior direction. Most non-mammaliamorph Therapsida and probably some Mesozoic Mammaliamorpha had prehensile autopodia with an opposable ray I. In forms with a pronounced relief of the respective joints, ray I could be opposed to 90° against ray III. A strong transverse arch in the row of distalia supported the opposition movement of ray I and resulted in a convergence of the claws of digits II–V just by flexing those digits. A tight articular coherence in the digital joints of digits II–V during strong flexion supported a firm grip capacity. Usually the grip capacity was more pronounced in the manus than in the pes. Prehensile autopodia of carnivorous Therapsida may have been utilized to hold prey while biting, thus helping to avoid fractures of the laterally compressed fangs."

https://openalex.org/W2089163723,"Discoveries on the toxic effects of cysteine accumulation and, particularly, recent findings on the many physiological roles of one of the products of cysteine catabolism, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), are highlighting the importance of this amino acid and sulfur metabolism in a range of cellular activities. It is also highlighting how little we know about this critical part of cellular metabolism. In the work described here, a genome-wide screen using a deletion collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed a surprising set of genes associated with this process. In addition, the yeast vacuole, not previously associated with cysteine catabolism, emerged as an important compartment for cysteine degradation. Most prominent among the vacuole-related mutants were those involved in vacuole acidification; we identified each of the eight subunits of a vacuole acidification sub-complex (V1 of the yeast V-ATPase) as essential for cysteine degradation. Other functions identified included translation, RNA processing, folate-derived one-carbon metabolism, and mitochondrial iron-sulfur homeostasis. This work identified for the first time cellular factors affecting the fundamental process of cysteine catabolism. Results obtained significantly contribute to the understanding of this process and may provide insight into the underlying cause of cysteine accumulation and H2S generation in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2117428817,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells provide a potentially useful in vitro model for the study of in vivo tissue differentiation. We used mouse and human ES cells to investigate whether the lens regulatory genes Pax6 and Six3 could induce lens cell fate in vitro. To help assess the onset of lens differentiation, we derived a new mES cell line (Pax6-GFP mES) that expresses a GFP reporter under the control of the Pax6 P0 promoter and lens ectoderm enhancer. Pax6 or Six3 expression vectors were introduced into mES or hES cells by transfection or lentiviral infection and the differentiating ES cells analyzed for lens marker expression. Transfection of mES cells with Pax6 or Six3 but not with other genes induced the expression of lens cell markers and up-regulated GFP reporter expression in Pax6-GFP mES cells by 3 days post-transfection. By 7 days post-transfection, mES cell cultures exhibited a>10-fold increase over controls in the number of colonies expressing γA-crystallin, a lens fiber cell differentiation marker. RT-PCR and immunostaining revealed induction of additional lens epithelial or fiber cell differentiation markers including Foxe3, Prox1, α- and β-crystallins, and Tdrd7. Moreover, γA-crystallin- or Prox1-expressing lentoid bodies formed by 30 days in culture. In hES cells, Pax6 or Six3 lentiviral vectors also induced lens marker expression. mES cells that express lens markers reside close to but are distinct from the Pax6 or Six3 transduced cells, suggesting that the latter induce nearby undifferentiated ES cells to adopt a lens fate by non-cell autonomous mechanisms. In sum, we describe a novel mES cell GFP reporter line that is useful for monitoring induction of lens fate, and demonstrate that Pax6 or Six3 is sufficient to induce ES cells to adopt a lens fate, potentially via non-cell autonomous mechanisms. These findings should facilitate investigations of lens development."
https://openalex.org/W2090464155,"Pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be efficiently directed to become immature neuroepithelial precursor cells (NPCs) and functional mature neural cells, including neurotransmitter-secreting neurons and glial cells. Investigating the susceptibility of these hESCs-derived neural cells to neurotrophic viruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), provides insight into the viral cell tropism in the infected human brain. We demonstrate that hESC-derived NPCs are highly vulnerable to JEV infection at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). In addition, glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)-expressing glial cells are also susceptible to JEV infection. In contrast, only a few mature neurons were infected at MOI 10 or higher on the third day post-infection. In addition, functional neurotransmitter-secreting neurons are also resistant to JEV infection at high MOI. Moreover, we discover that vimentin intermediate filament, reported as a putative neurovirulent JEV receptor, is highly expressed in NPCs and glial cells, but not mature neurons. These results indicate that the expression of vimentin in neural cells correlates to the cell tropism of JEV. Finally, we further demonstrate that membranous vimentin is necessary for the susceptibility of hESC-derived NPCs to JEV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2054636259,"Platycladus Spach is native to Central China, but its natural occurrences are very difficult to establish. According to molecular phylogenetic data, this genus might have originated since the Oligocene, but no fossil record has been reported. Here, we describe eight foliage branches from the upper Miocene in western Yunnan, Southwest China as a new species, P. yunnanensis sp. nov., which is characterized by foliage branches spread in flattened sprays, and leaves decussate, imbricate, scale-like and dimorphic. The leaves are amphistomatic, and the stomata are elliptical or oblong, haplocheilic, and monocyclic type. Based on a detailed comparison with the extant genera of Cupressaceae sensu lato, our fossils are classified into the genus Platycladus. The occurrence of P. yunnanensis sp. nov. indicates that this genus had a more southernly natural distribution in the late Miocene than at present. Molecular phylogeny and fossil records support a pre-Oligocene common ancestor for the genera Platycladus, Microbiota and Calocedrus. The separation of the three taxa was most likely caused by the arid belt across Central China during the Oligocene. In addition, the cooling down of the global temperature and the strengthening of Asian monsoon since the Miocene will further promote the migration of these genera."
https://openalex.org/W2076752414,"Balancing timber production and conservation in forest management requires an understanding of how timber harvests affect wildlife species. Terrestrial salamanders are useful indicators of mature forest ecosystem health due to their importance to ecosystem processes and sensitivity to environmental change. However, the effects of timber harvests on salamanders, though often researched, are still not well understood. To further this understanding, we used artificial cover objects to monitor the relative abundance of terrestrial salamanders for two seasons (fall and spring) pre-harvest and five seasons post-harvest in six forest management treatments, and for three seasons post-harvest across the edge gradients of six recent clearcuts. In total, we recorded 19,048 encounters representing nine species of salamanders. We observed declines in mean encounters of eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) and northern slimy salamanders (P. glutinosus) from pre- to post-harvest in group selection cuts and in clearcuts. However, we found no evidence of salamander declines at shelterwoods and forested sites adjacent to harvests. Edge effects induced by recent clearcuts influenced salamanders for approximately 20 m into the forest, but edge influence varied by slope orientation. Temperature, soil moisture, and canopy cover were all correlated with salamander counts. Our results suggest silvicultural techniques that remove the forest canopy negatively affect salamander relative abundance on the local scale during the years immediately following harvest, and that the depth of edge influence of clearcuts on terrestrial salamanders is relatively shallow (<20 m). Small harvests (<4 ha) and techniques that leave the forest canopy intact may be compatible with maintaining terrestrial salamander populations across a forested landscape. Our results demonstrate the importance of examining species-specific responses and monitoring salamanders across multiple seasons and years. Long-term monitoring will be necessary to understand the full impacts of forest management on terrestrial salamanders."
https://openalex.org/W2036951200,"Children that are exposed to abuse or neglect show abnormal hippocampal function. However, the developmental mechanisms by which early life stress (ELS) impairs normal hippocampal development have not been elucidated. Here we propose that exposure to ELS blunts normal hippocampal growth by inhibiting the availability of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In support of this hypothesis, we show that the normal mouse hippocampus undergoes a growth-spurt during the second week of life, followed by a gradual decrease in DNA and RNA content that persists into adulthood. This developmental pattern is associated with accelerated ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis during the second week of life, followed by a gradual decline in rRNA levels that continue into adulthood. Levels of DNA methylation at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter are lower during the second week of life compared to earlier development or adulthood. Exposure to brief daily separation (BDS), a mouse model of early life stress, increased DNA methylation at the ribosomal DNA promoter, decreased rRNA levels, and blunted hippocampal growth during the second week of life. Exposure to acute (3 hrs) maternal separation decreased rRNA and increased DNA methylation at the rDNA proximal promoter, suggesting that exposure to stress early in life can rapidly regulate the availability of rRNA levels in the developing hippocampus. Given the critical role that rRNA plays in supporting normal growth and development, these findings suggest a novel molecular mechanism to explain how stress early in life impairs hippocampus development in the mouse."

Owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) are ideal models among anthropoids to study the information used during foraging at low light levels because they are unique by having a nocturnal lifestyle. Six Aotus nigriceps and four A. infulatus individuals distributed into five enclosures were studied for testing their ability to rely on olfactory, visual, auditory, or spatial and quantitative information for locating food rewards and for evaluating the use of routes to navigate among five visually similar artificial feeding boxes mounted in each enclosure. During most experiments only a single box was baited with a food reward in each session. The baited box changed randomly throughout the experiment. In the spatial and quantitative information experiment there were two baited boxes varying in the amount of food provided. These baited boxes remained the same throughout the experiment. A total of 45 sessions (three sessions per night during 15 consecutive nights) per enclosure was conducted in each experiment. Only one female showed a performance suggestive of learning of the usefulness of sight to locate the food reward in the visual information experiment. Subjects showed a chance performance in the remaining experiments. All owl monkeys showed a preference for one box or a subset of boxes to inspect upon the beginning of each experimental session and consistently followed individual routes among feeding boxes."
https://openalex.org/W2095354241,"Background Obese, non-acromegalic persons show lower growth hormone (GH) concentrations at fasting and reduced GH nadir during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). However, this finding has never been studied with regard to whole-body insulin-sensitivity as a possible regulator. Methods In this retrospective analysis, non-acromegalic (NonACRO, n = 161) and acromegalic (ACRO, n = 35), non-diabetic subjects were subdivided into insulin-sensitive (IS) and –resistant (IR) groups according to the Clamp-like Index (CLIX)-threshold of 5 mg·kg−1·min−1 from the OGTT. Results Non-acromegalic IS (CLIX: 8.8±0.4 mg·kg−1·min−1) persons with similar age and sex distribution, but lower (p<0.001) body-mass-index (BMI = 25±0 kg/m2, 84% females, 56±1 years) had 59% and 70%, respectively, higher (p<0.03) fasting GH and OGTT GH area under the curve concentrations than IR (CLIX: 3.5±0.1 mg·kg−1·min−1, p<0.001) subjects (BMI = 29±1 kg/m2, 73% females, 58±1 years). When comparing on average overweight non-acromegalic IS and IR with similar anthropometry (IS: BMI: 27±0 kg/m2, 82% females, 58±2 years; IR: BMI: 27±0 kg/m2, 71% females, 60±1 years), but different CLIX (IS: 8.7±0.9 vs. IR: 3.8±0.1 mg·kg−1·min−1, p<0.001), the results remained almost the same. In addition, when adjusted for OGTT-mediated glucose rise, GH fall was less pronounced in IR. In contrast, in acromegalic subjects, no difference was found between IS and IR patients with regard to fasting and post-glucose-load GH concentrations. Conclusions Circulating GH concentrations at fasting and during the OGTT are lower in non-acromegalic insulin-resistant subjects. This study seems the first to demonstrate that insulin sensitivity rather than body-mass modulates fasting and post-glucose-load GH concentrations in non-diabetic non–acromegalic subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2050108722,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a complication of prematurity. The etiology is unknown, but is related to enteral feeding, ischemia, infection, and inflammation. Reactive oxygen species production, most notably superoxide, increases in NEC. NADPH oxidase (NOX) generates superoxide, but its activity in NEC remains unknown. We hypothesize that NOX-derived superoxide production increases in NEC. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control, formula-fed, formula/LPS, formula/hypoxia, and NEC (formula, hypoxia, and LPS). Intestinal homogenates were analyzed for NADPH-dependent superoxide production. Changes in superoxide levels on days 0-4 were measured. Inhibitors for nitric oxide synthase (L-NAME) and NOX2 (GP91-ds-tat) were utilized. RT-PCR for eNOS, NOX1, GP91phox expression was performed. Immunofluorescence studies estimated the co-localization of p47phox and GP91phox in control and NEC animals on D1, D2, and D4. NEC pups generated more superoxide than controls on D4, while all other groups were unchanged. NADPH-dependent superoxide production was greater in NEC on days 0, 3, and 4. GP91-ds-tat decreased superoxide production in both groups, with greater inhibition in NEC. L-NAME did not alter superoxide production. Temporally, superoxide production varied minimally in controls. In NEC, superoxide generation was decreased on day 1, but increased on days 3-4. GP91phox expression was higher in NEC on days 2 and 4. NOX1 and eNOS expression were unchanged from controls. GP91phox and p47phox had minimal co-localization in all control samples and NEC samples on D1 and D2, but had increased co-localization on D4. In conclusion, this study proves that experimentally-induced NEC increases small intestinal NOX activity. All components of NEC model are necessary for increased NOX activity. NOX2 is the major source, especially as the disease progresses."
https://openalex.org/W2060126674,"Human observers perceive illusory rotations after the disappearance of circularly repeating patches containing dark-to-light luminance. This afterimage rotation is a very powerful phenomenon, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying it. Here, we use a computational model to show that the afterimage rotation can be explained by a combination of fast light adaptation and the physiological architecture of the early visual system, consisting of ON- and OFF-type visual pathways. In this retinal ON/OFF model, the afterimage rotation appeared as a rotation of focus lines of retinal ON/OFF responses. Focus lines rotated clockwise on a light background, but counterclockwise on a dark background. These findings were consistent with the results of psychophysical experiments, which were also performed by us. Additionally, the velocity of the afterimage rotation was comparable with that observed in our psychophysical experiments. These results suggest that the early visual system (including the retina) is responsible for the generation of the afterimage rotation, and that this illusory rotation may be systematically misinterpreted by our high-level visual system."
