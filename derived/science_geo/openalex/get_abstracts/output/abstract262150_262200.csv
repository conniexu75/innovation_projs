https://openalex.org/W2115099498,"Ecological niche models (ENMs) provide a means of characterizing the spatial distribution of suitable conditions for species, and have recently been applied to the challenge of locating potential distributional areas at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when unfavorable climate conditions led to range contractions and fragmentation. Here, we compare and contrast ENM-based reconstructions of LGM refugial locations with those resulting from the more traditional molecular genetic and phylogeographic predictions. We examined 20 North American terrestrial vertebrate species from different regions and with different range sizes for which refugia have been identified based on phylogeographic analyses, using ENM tools to make parallel predictions. We then assessed the correspondence between the two approaches based on spatial overlap and areal extent of the predicted refugia. In 14 of the 20 species, the predictions from ENM and predictions based on phylogeographic studies were significantly spatially correlated, suggesting that the two approaches to development of refugial maps are converging on a similar result. Our results confirm that ENM scenario exploration can provide a useful complement to molecular studies, offering a less subjective, spatially explicit hypothesis of past geographic patterns of distribution."

https://openalex.org/W2074718000,"Variants on chromosome 8q24 contribute risk for prostate cancer; here, we tested whether they also modulate risk for colorectal cancer. We studied 1,807 affected individuals and 5,511 controls and found that one variant, rs6983267, is also significantly associated with colorectal cancer (odds ratio = 1.22; P = 4.4 x 10(-6)) and that the apportionment of risk among the variants differs significantly between the two cancers. Comprehensive testing in the region uncovered variants capturing significant additional risk. Our results show that variants at 8q24 have different effects on cancer development that depend on the tissue type."
https://openalex.org/W1989068609,"Genomewide DNA hypomethylation is a consistent finding in human tumors, but the importance of this change for human tumorigenesis remains an open question. We have previously reported that mice carrying a hypomorphic allele for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1(chip/-)) are hypomethylated and develop thymic lymphomas, demonstrating that genomewide DNA hypomethylation can induce tumors. Hypomethylated cells exhibit inherent chromosomal instability, which is revealed in the lymphomas as a consistent trisomy of chromosome 15. We now report another aspect of the molecular basis for tumor development upon DNA hypomethylation. Seven out of 16 hypomethylation-induced lymphomas were found to contain an intracisternal A particle (IAP) somatic insertion in the middle of the Notch1 genomic locus, leading to generation of an oncogenic form of Notch1 in the tumors. This finding suggests that the molecular basis for hypomethylation-induced tumors in this model involves chromosomal instability events accompanied by activation of endogenous retroviral elements. Our findings validate the proposed role of DNA methylation in suppression of transposable elements in mammalian cells and demonstrate the importance of DNA methylation for normal cell function as well as the potential consequences of spontaneously occurring or chemically induced DNA hypomethylation."

https://openalex.org/W2065374619,"The radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) increases the probability of cellular response and therefore has important implications for cancer risk assessment following low-dose irradiation and for the likelihood of secondary cancers after radiotherapy. However, our knowledge of bystander signaling factors, especially those having long half-lives, is still limited. The present study found that, when a fraction of cells within a glioblastoma population were individually irradiated with helium ions from a particle microbeam, the yield of micronuclei (MN) in the nontargeted cells was increased, but these bystander MN were eliminated by treating the cells with either aminoguanidine (an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase) or anti-transforming growth factor β1 (anti-TGF-β1), indicating that NO and TGF-β1 are involved in the RIBE. Intracellular NO was detected in the bystander cells, and additional TGF-β1 was detected in the medium from irradiated T98G cells, but it was diminished by aminoguanidine. Consistent with this, an NO donor, diethylamine nitric oxide (DEANO), induced TGF-β1 generation in T98G cells. Conversely, treatment of cells with recombinant TGF-β1 could also induce NO and MN in T98G cells. Treatment of T98G cells with anti-TGF-β1 inhibited the NO production when only 1% of cells were targeted, but not when 100% of cells were targeted. Our results indicate that, downstream of radiation-induced NO, TGF-β1 can be released from targeted T98G cells and plays a key role as a signaling factor in the RIBE by further inducing free radicals and DNA damage in the nontargeted bystander cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078977128,"Background The cellular basis of long term radiation damage in the brain is not fully understood. Methods and Findings We administered a dose of 25Gy to adult rat brains while shielding the olfactory bulbs. Quantitative analyses were serially performed on different brain regions over 15 months. Our data reveal an immediate and permanent suppression of SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis. The olfactory bulb demonstrates a transient but remarkable SVZ-independent ability for compensation and maintenance of the calretinin interneuron population. The oligodendrocyte compartment exhibits a complex pattern of limited proliferation of NG2 progenitors but steady loss of the oligodendroglial antigen O4. As of nine months post radiation, diffuse demyelination starts in all irradiated brains. Counts of capillary segments and length demonstrate significant loss one day post radiation but swift and persistent recovery of the vasculature up to 15 months post XRT. MRI imaging confirms loss of volume of the corpus callosum and early signs of demyelination at 12 months. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates progressive degradation of myelin sheaths with axonal preservation. Areas of focal necrosis appear beyond 15 months and are preceded by widespread demyelination. Human white matter specimens obtained post-radiation confirm early loss of oligodendrocyte progenitors and delayed onset of myelin sheath fragmentation with preserved capillaries. Conclusions This study demonstrates that long term radiation injury is associated with irreversible damage to the neural stem cell compartment in the rodent SVZ and loss of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in both rodent and human brain. Delayed onset demyelination precedes focal necrosis and is likely due to the loss of oligodendrocyte precursors and the inability of the stem cell compartment to compensate for this loss."
https://openalex.org/W1986740576,"Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary cannabinoid of marijuana and has been shown to either potentiate or inhibit tumor growth, depending on the type of cancer and its pathogenesis. Little is known about the activity of cannabinoids like THC on epidermal growth factor receptor-overexpressing lung cancers, which are often highly aggressive and resistant to chemotherapy. In this study, we characterized the effects of THC on the EGF-induced growth and metastasis of human non-small cell lung cancer using the cell lines A549 and SW-1573 as in vitro models. We found that these cells express the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, known targets for THC action, and that THC inhibited EGF-induced growth, chemotaxis and chemoinvasion. Moreover, signaling studies indicated that THC may act by inhibiting the EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and AKT. THC also induced the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at tyrosine 397. Additionally, in in vivo studies in severe combined immunodeficient mice, there was significant inhibition of the subcutaneous tumor growth and lung metastasis of A549 cells in THC-treated animals as compared to vehicle-treated controls. Tumor samples from THC-treated animals revealed antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects of THC. Our study suggests that cannabinoids like THC should be explored as novel therapeutic molecules in controlling the growth and metastasis of certain lung cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2115657133,"The roles of the HIV1 protein Vpr in virus replication and pathogenesis remain unclear. Expression of Vpr in dividing cells causes cell cycle arrest in G2. Vpr also facilitates low titer infection of terminally differentiated macrophages, enhances transcription, promotes apoptosis, and targets cellular uracil N-glycosylase for degradation. Using co-immunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectroscopy, we found that HIV1 Vpr engages a DDB1- and cullin4A-containing ubiquitin-ligase complex through VprBP/DCAF1. HIV2 Vpr has two Vpr-like proteins, Vpr and Vpx, which cause G2 arrest and facilitate macrophage infection, respectively. HIV2 Vpr, but not Vpx, engages the same set of proteins. We further demonstrate that the interaction between Vpr and the ubiquitin-ligase components as well as further assembly of the ubiquitin-ligase are necessary for Vpr-mediated G2 arrest. Our data support a model in which Vpr engages the ubiquitin ligase to deplete a cellular factor that is required for cell cycle progression into mitosis.

The phosphorylation status of proteins that regulate the cell cycle indicates that Vpr triggers a cellular state similar to that resulting from DNA damage. ATR and Chk1 become activated, and this, like Vpr-mediated arrest, can be blocked by caffeine (3Tachiwana H. Shimura M. Nakai-Murakami C. Tokunaga K. Takizawa Y. Sata T. Kurumizaka H. Ishizaka Y.

Although it is a relatively small protein, Vpr has at least two nuclear import signals and one nuclear export signal (15Di Marzio P. Choe S. Ebright M. Knoblauch R. Landau N.R. J.

Emerman M. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 0170-0178Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In vitro, the importance of Vpr for HIV replication is most apparent during the establishment of low-titer infections of terminally differentiated macrophages (12Heinzinger N.K. Bukinsky M.I. Haggerty S.A. Ragland A.M. Kewalramani V. Lee M.A. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Stevenson M. Emerman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The significance of Vpr for HIV biology in vivo is reflected by its highly conserved sequence and its expression by virtually all primary virus isolates. Furthermore, HIV2 and several SIV strains have two Vpr-like open reading frames that resulted from apparent duplication of a single parental gene (28Tristem M. Marshall C. Karpas A. Hill F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3405-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In these viruses one gene product, Vpr, causes G2 arrest, and the other, Vpx, boosts infection of terminally differentiated macrophages (29Fletcher 3rd, T.M. Brichacek B. Sharova N. Newman M.A. Stivahtis G. Sharp P.M. Emerman M. Hahn B.H. Stevenson M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6155-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The duplication of Vpr supports the findings that HIV1 Vpr has multiple functions and the supposition that their importance for virus function outweighs the cost of maintaining extra coding sequences. The duplication may also have enabled further refinement of Vpr functions by promoting independent evolution. Schröfelbauer et al. (30Schröfelbauer B. Yu Q. Zeitlin S.G. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10978-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that Vpr promotes proteasomal degradation of the cellular enzyme uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG). This function was linked with cullins 1 and 4 (cul1 and cul4) and shown to enhance virus replication in the presence of the cellular cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G. The virus likely benefits from reduced UNG levels in the presence of APOBEC3G because uracil residues formed in the pro-viruses as a result of cytidine deamination will not be targeted for excision. The goal of our work is to determine how HIV1 Vpr acts to cause cell cycle arrest by identifying its cellular protein partners. Our work is among the first to identify endogenous cellular partners that co-immunoprecipitate with Vpr rather than relying on yeast-based interaction screens. Our results show that Vpr mediates G2 arrest by engaging an ubiquitin ligase complex containing DDB1 and cul4A through the previously identified cellular Vpr partner VprBP. Our results strongly suggest that Vpr promotes the degradation of an as yet unidentified factor that is required for cell cycle progression from G2 to mitosis. Cell Culture—The 293T transformed human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone, Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Plasmids and Cell Transfection—The plasmid pcDNA3. 1huVpr expresses Vpr using human preferred (humanized) codons. The Vpr reading frame was cloned into pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen) between the XbaI and HindIII sites. The plasmids pcDNA3.1FLAG-huVpr and pcDNA3.1HIV2FLAG-huVpr express HIV1 or HIV2 Vpr, respectively, with a single FLAG epitope tag at the amino terminus. The LaminC-enhanced green fluorescent protein expression construct was a gift from Dr. Ronald Goldman. The T7-DDB1 expression vector was a gift from Dr. Pradip Raychaudhuri. The pSPORT6-based VprBP expression vector was purchased from Open Biosystems (Image clone ID 5547856). pSport6 FLAG-VprBP was constructed by excising the SalI to BamHI fragment from pSPORT6 VprBP and replacing it with one containing the FLAG epitope tag preceded by a start codon and followed by six consecutive glycine residues. The plasmid for expression of the non-degrading T187A mutant of p27Kip was a gift from Dr. Masaki Matsumoto. The plasmid for expression of dominant negative cul1 (DN cul1) was a gift from Dr. Zhen-Qiang Pan. The dominant negative cul4A (DN cul4A) expression vector was constructed by amplifying cul4A coding sequences with oligonucleotides HACul4A 5′ (5′-GCACTCTAGAACCATGGCCTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCATGGCGGACGAGGCCCCG-3′) and Cul4AStop 3′ H3 (5′-GTACAAGCTTCAGTGCTGCAGCAGCGCC-3′) and cloning the DNA into the XbaI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(-). This vector directs expression of the first 339 amino acids of cul4A with an amino-terminal HA epitope tag. The cul4A expression vector used for the amplification was a gift of Dr. Peter Jackson. Plasmid DNA was introduced into cells using conventional calcium phosphate transfection in the presence of chloroquine. A total of 4 μg of DNA was added to each 6-well plate well (200 μl volume of calcium phosphate mix into 2 ml of media), and 20 μg of DNA was added to each 10-cm plate (1-ml volume of calcium phosphate mix into 10 ml of media). Immunoprecipitation and Tandem Mass Spectroscopy Analysis—3 × 106 293T cells were seeded into 10-cm plates and transfected with 20 μg of pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1HIV1huVpr, pcDNA3.1HIV1FLAG-huVpr, or pcDNA3.1HIV2FLAG-huVpr. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were lysed with 1.0 ml of cold ELB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, as per instructions)). The lysates were cleared twice by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 agarose resin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The beads were then washed three times with ELB. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 200 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 10 min. After boiling in Laemmli buffer, the proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to silver-staining or Western blotting. Protein bands were excised, dried, and identified using tandem mass spectroscopy (Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility). To determine whether Vpr forms complexes with DDB1 through VprBP, 293T cells were transfected with HIV1 Vpr or HIV1 FLAG-Vpr together with empty control vector, VprBP-directed short hairpin RNA (shRNA), or DDB1-directed shRNA. Cells were lysed with ELB buffer 1 day after transfection and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG-agarose beads as described above. Experiments to determine whether cul4A co-immunoprecipitates with Vpr were performed as follows. 293T HEK cells were transfected with HIV1 FLAG-Vpr, HIV2 FLAG-Vpr, or HIV2 FLAG-Vpx expression vector and lysed 24 h later in buffer consisting of 5 μm CHAPS, 50 μm NaCl, and 20 μm Tris, pH7.5. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation before the addition of beads bearing FLAG-specific antibody. The samples were placed on a rotator for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with the lysis buffer. Western blots of the pre- and post-immunoprecipitation samples were probed for DDB1, cul4A, and for HIV1 or HIV2 FLAG-Vpr or HIV2 FLAG-Vpx. Immunoblotting—Proteins immunoprecipitated as described above were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-PSQ membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween20 and then incubated in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C in the presence of primary antibody diluted 1:2000. The primary antibodies used were VprBP-specific polyclonal antiserum (a gift from Dr. Ling-Jun Zhao), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-HA monoclonal 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science), DDB1-specific polyclonal antiserum (Invitrogen), anti-cul4A (a gift from Dr. Yue Xiong), and anti-rpS3 (a gift from Dr. Andrew Deutsch). The membranes were washed 3 times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with secondary, horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated antibody diluted 1:20,000 with 5% nonfat milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween20 (ZyMax Grade, Invitrogen). The immobilized proteins were detected with Immobilon Western horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore). Short Hairpin RNA—The DDB1-directed shRNA vector and VprBP-directed shRNA vector were purchased from Open Biosystems (Clone ID V2HS_151134 and V2SH_74153, respectively). These expression vectors were transfected with calcium phosphate as described above. Cell Cycle Analysis—293T cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with expression vectors for DDB1 or VprBP- or DDB1-directed shRNA or DN cul1 or DN cul4A together with a constant amount of empty, HIV1 Vpr, or HIV2 Vpr expression vector. Each transfection contained 4 μg of DNA. Empty expression vector was added to transfections if less than 4 μg of expression vector was used. LaminC-GFP (0.17 μg/culture) was co-transfected into experimental samples to allow identification of transfected cells by flow cytometry. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. After 2 washes with PBS the cells were suspended in 200 μl of PBS and 200 μl of propidium iodide staining solution (10 mm PIPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml RNase A, and 0.02 mg/ml propidium iodide adjusted to pH 6.8) for 20 min before flow cytometry. This procedure removes the cytoplasm and allows analysis of nuclear DNA content. Data were collected on a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo analysis software. DNA Damage Experiments—293T cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. Each transfection contained 4 μg of DNA. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of empty expression vector and 3 μg of expression vectors for DDB1 or VprBP- or DDB1-directed shRNA, DN cul1, or DN cul4A. LaminC-GFP (0.17 μg/culture) was co-transfected to allow identification of transfected cells by flow cytometry. 20 h after transfection the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh media containing either Me2SO, doxorubicin (0.25 nm) or etoposide (1 μm) dissolved in Me2SO. The cells were then cultured for an additional 18 h before the cell cycle profile was analyzed as described above. Cellular Proteins DDB1 and VprBP Co-immunoprecipitate with Both HIV1 and HIV2 Vpr—The goal of our work was to learn how the HIV1 protein Vpr promotes G2 cell cycle arrest by identifying its cellular protein partners. We used co-immunoprecipitation to isolate native cellular components that engage amino-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged Vpr. The single FLAG tag at the amino terminus does not interfere with the capacity of Vpr to cause cell cycle arrest. To assure that both our experimental and control immunoprecipitations were from closely matched cells, we expressed untagged Vpr in our control cultures. Furthermore, because a large number of cellular interaction partners have previously been identified for Vpr, we chose to compare the identity of the proteins that co-isolate with HIV1 Vpr with those that co-isolate with HIV2 Vpr as a specificity control. Expression of both Vpr types causes G2 arrest, whereas the two share only about 50% amino acid identity. We lysed the transfected cells and immunoprecipitated HIV1 FLAG-Vpr or HIV2 FLAG-Vpr using anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity beads. Lysates from cells expressing untagged HIV1 Vpr served as our immunoprecipitation background controls. FLAG-Vpr and associated proteins were eluted from the beads using FLAG peptide. The eluates were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and proteins were visualized by silver-staining. Protein bands present in the HIV1 or HIV2 FLAG-Vpr samples and not in those from the cultures transfected with untagged Vpr were excised and identified using tandem mass spectroscopy. Four proteins co-immunoprecipitated with HIV1 FLAG-Vpr, and two of these also co-isolated with HIV2 FLAG-Vpr (Fig. 1A). The 32-kDa protein, rpS3, was isolated only with HIV1 FLAG-Vpr and not with HIV2 FLAG-Vpr. It was first identified as a ribosomal component but later also found to excise abasic residues from DNA (31Jung S.O. Lee J.Y. Kim J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 12: 84-90Google Scholar). Similarly, only HIV1 FLAG-Vpr engaged the 125-kDa protein matrin 3. This protein is a component of the nuclear matrix (32Belgrader P. Dey R. Berezney R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9893-9899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been implicated in nuclear retention of hyper-edited RNA (33Zhang Z. Carmichael G.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Both HIV1 and HIV2 FLAG-Vpr engaged DDB1 (127-kDa) and VprBP (180-kDa). DDB1 was identified as a DNA damage-binding protein (34Dualan R. Brody T. Keeney S. Nichols A.F. Admon A. Linn S. Genomics. 1995; 29: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but later work showed that it acts as a platform for the assembly of cul4A- and B-containing ubiquitin ligase complexes (35Shiyanov P. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35309-35312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Paramyxovirus V proteins act as adaptors to DDB1 and thereby cause the degradation of Stat proteins to hinder interferon-α signaling via the Jak/Stat (Jak/signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway (36Ulane C.M. Horvath C.M. Virology. 2002; 304: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). VprBP had only been characterized as a binding partner for Vpr, and little was known about its normal cellular function (37Zhang S.G. Feng Y.F. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A number of recent publications, however, have shown that VprBP is a protein partner for DDB1, possibly acting as an adaptor between the ubiquitin ligase complex and a specific target protein or proteins. Both DDB1 and VprBP co-purified with HIV1 and HIV2 Vpr but not with HIV2 Vpx (data not shown). These proteins, thus, met our criteria for putative cellular partners for Vpr that could be involved in Vpr-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest. We hypothesize that Matrin 3 and rpS3, which engage only HIV1 Vpr but not HIV2 Vpr, are either involved in HIV1-specific Vpr functions, possibly overlapping with those of HIV2 Vpx, or represent spurious interactions. VprBP Acts to Bridge Vpr with DDB1—We consistently isolated both VprBP and DDB1 with Vpr, leading us to hypothesize that the proteins are in a complex together. This premise was supported by the recent observation that VprBP is a cellular partner for DDB1 in the absence of Vpr (38Angers S. Li T. Yi X. MacCoss M.J. Moon R.T. Zheng N. Nature. 2006; 443: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 39Jin J. Arias E.E. Chen J. Harper J.W. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 709-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and the previous finding that Vpr engages VprBP (37Zhang S.G. Feng Y.F. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We further hypothesized that Vpr engages DDB1 by using VprBP as an adaptor. If VprBP functions as an adaptor between Vpr and DDB1, we reasoned that reduction of steady-state VprBP levels should hinder isolation of DDB1 through Vpr. We, thus, depleted VprBP in HIV1 Vpr or HIV1 FLAG-Vpr-expressing cells with shRNA directed against VprBP and immunoprecipitated HIV1 FLAG-Vpr with anti-FLAG antibody-coated beads. HIV1 Vpr expression vector-transfected cells served as our negative controls. The quantity of DDB1 that was co-isolated with FLAG-Vpr fell to 16% that co-isolated from the empty vector control. This corresponded with the reduction of VprBP co-isolation, which fell to 19% that of the empty vector control (Fig. 2A). To assure that the reduction of VprBP affected only the amount of DDB1 that was isolated through Vpr, we re-probed the Western blots for rpS3, one of the other proteins that co-immunoprecipitates with HIV1 FLAG-Vpr (Fig. 1). As we expected, the amount of rpS3 that was co-isolated with HIV1 FLAG-Vpr remained relatively unchanged (Fig. 2A). We further reasoned that if Vpr engages VprBP and not DDB1 directly, decreasing cellular DDB1 levels should not impact the quantity of VprBP co-immunoprecipitated with Vpr. We depleted DDB1 in HIV1 Vpr- or HIV1 FLAG-Vpr-expressing cells with shRNA directed against DDB1 and immunoprecipitated HIV1 FLAG-Vpr with anti-FLAG antibody-coated beads. The cells transfected with HIV1 Vpr expression vector served as our negative controls. As expected, the quantity of DDB1 recovered decreased (52% of the control), but the quantity of VprBP did not (Fig. 2B). The relative level of rpS3, our internal co-immunoprecipitation control, similarly did not decline (Fig. 2B). This observation further supports our model that Vpr engages VprBP directly and likely uses it as an adaptor to DDB1. Of note, we consistently observed higher levels of Vpr in both VprBP- and DDB1-depleted cells than in non-depleted control cells (Fig. 2, A and B). This suggests that Vpr may be getting degraded as a component of an active ubiquitin ligase complex. Consistent with this observation is the finding by Schröfelbauer et al. (30Schröfelbauer B. Yu Q. Zeitlin S.G. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10978-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) that cells express more Vpr when cultured in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Cul4A is a part of the DDB1-containing ubiquitin ligase complex. We, therefore, examined whether it is also a part of the HIV1 Vpr·VprBP·DDB1 complex. Cells were transfected with HIV1 FLAG-Vpr, HIV2 FLAG-Vpr, or HIV2 FLAG-Vpx expression vectors and lysed with a CHAPS-containing buffer as used by Schröfelbauer et al. (30Schröfelbauer B. Yu Q. Zeitlin S.G. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10978-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). FLAG-specific antibodies were used to isolate HIV1 or 2 FLAG-Vpr or HIV2 FLAG-Vpx from each of the cleared culture lysates. Cul4A was co-isolated with HIV1 and HIV2 FLAG-Vpr but not with HIV2 FLAG-Vpx (Fig. 2C). Our data together with a recently published structure of DDB1, based on x-ray crystallography and mapping of the Vpr/VprBP interaction, support a model in which Vpr engages a DDB1-containing ubiquitin ligase complex using VprBP as an adaptor molecule (Fig. 2D). The structural data show that DDB1 consists of three interconnected propeller motifs, one of which likely provides an interaction surface for the WD40 domain of VprBP (38Angers S. Li T. Yi X. MacCoss M.J. Moon R.T. Zheng N. Nature. 2006; 443: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Vpr-mediated G2 Cell Cycle Arrest Is DDB1-dependent—Expression of HIV1 or HIV2 Vpr causes dividing cells to arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Because both of these Vpr species engage VprBP and DDB1, we hypothesized that both act to halt cell cycle progression through a complex containing these proteins. Furthermore, the SV5 V protein, which apparently functions through DDB1 directly, also causes cells to arrest in G2 (40Li T. Chen X. Garbutt K.C. Zhou P. Zheng N. Cell. 2006; 124: 105-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 41Lin G.Y. Lamb R.A. J.

Virol. 2005; 79: 13434-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The observation that SV5 V-mediated arrest can be blocked by overexpression of DDB1 provided the starting point for our functional analysis of the role that Vpr plays in the ubiquitin ligase complex (42Precious B. Childs K. Fitzpatrick-Swallow V. Goodbourn S. Randall R.E. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13434-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that SV5-mediated arrest observed by Precious et al. (42Precious B. Childs K. Fitzpatrick-Swallow V. Goodbourn S. Randall R.E. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13434-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) is due to ubiquitylation and degradation of a factor necessary for cell cycle progression. Overexpression of DDB1 in the context of the model shown in Fig. 2D could interfere with ubiquitylation by providing a molecular sink separately for SV5 V and for cul4A complexed with ROC and E2. This blocks ubiquitylation by separating ubiquitin ligase components from the target proteins. We tested whether overexpression of DDB1 interferes with Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest as it interfered with SV5 V-mediated arrest. 293T cells were transfecte"

https://openalex.org/W2056391968,"E-cadherin is a ubiquitous component of lateral membranes in epithelial tissues and is required to form the first lateral membrane domains in development. Here, we identify ankyrin-G as a molecular partner of E-cadherin and demonstrate that ankyrin-G and β-2-spectrin are required for accumulation of E-cadherin at the lateral membrane in both epithelial cells and early embryos. Ankyrin-G binds to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin at a conserved site distinct from that of β-catenin. Ankyrin-G also recruits β-2-spectrin to E-cadherin-β-catenin complexes, thus providing a direct connection between E-cadherin and the spectrin/actin skeleton. In addition to restricting the membrane mobility of E-cadherin, ankyrin-G and β-2-spectrin also are required for exit of E-cadherin from the trans-Golgi network in a microtubule-dependent pathway. Ankyrin-G and β-2-spectrin co-localize with E-cadherin in preimplantation mouse embryos. Moreover, knockdown of either ankyrin-G or β-2-spectrin in one cell of a two-cell embryo blocks accumulation of E-cadherin at sites of cell-cell contact. E-cadherin thus requires both ankyrin-G and β-2-spectrin for its cellular localization in early embryos as well as cultured epithelial cells. We have recently reported that ankyrin-G and β-2-spectrin collaborate in biogenesis of the lateral membrane(Kizhatil, K., Yoon, W., Mohler, P. J., Davis, L. H., Hoffman, J. A., and Bennett, V. (2007)J. Biol. Chem. 2822029-2037. Together with the current findings, these data suggest a ankyrin/spectrin-based mechanism for coordinating membrane assembly with extracellular interactions of E-cadherin at sites of cell-cell contact.

Together with the current findings, these data suggest a ankyrin/spectrin-based mechanism for coordinating membrane assembly with extracellular interactions of E-cadherin at sites of cell-cell contact. The lateral membrane domain of epithelial cells is of considerable physiological importance due to its roles in salt and water homeostasis and protection of epithelial tissues from mechanical stress. Moreover, loss of this specialized domain is a hallmark of metastatic cancer cells (1Huber M.A. Kraut N. Beug H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17,: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Recent studies employing siRNA have revealed that ankyrin-G and β-2-spectrin collaborate in formation of the lateral membrane of bronchial epithelial cells (2Kizhatil K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 16706-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3Kizhatil K. Yoon W. Mohler P.J. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282,: 2029-2037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells depleted of either protein maintain polarity but are converted from columnar to a squamous morphology with minimal lateral membrane and expanded apical and basal membranes. The loss of lateral membrane in ankyrin-G- and β-2-spectrin-depleted cells is accompanied by a failure in de novo membrane biogenesis during mitosis (2Kizhatil K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 16706-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3Kizhatil K. Yoon W. Mohler P.J. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Ankyrin-G and β-2-spectrin thus are required for bulk delivery of proteins and phospholipids to the lateral membrane. The cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is a prototypic component of lateral membranes in epithelial cells and is required for the first formation of lateral domains in development during compaction in eight-cell embryos (4Damsky C.H. Richa J. Solter D. Knudsen K. Buck C.A. Cell. 1983; 34,: 455-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 5Takeichi M. Annu. Rev.

E-cadherin has been proposed to recruit cytoskeletal proteins, including spectrin (7Piepenhagen P.A. Nelson W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9,: 3161-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Pradhan D. Lombardo C.R. Roe S. Rimm D.L. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276,: 4175-4181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). According to these models, spectrin in turn recruits ankyrin, which directly interacts with resident membrane-spanning proteins, such as the Na/K-ATPase (9Morrow J.S. Cianci C.D. Ardito T. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108,: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10Nelson W.J. Hammerton R.W. Nelson W.J. J.

E-cadherin forms a complex and co-immunoprecipitates with ankyrin and spectrin from extracts of cultured epithelial cells (12Nelson W.J. Shore E.M. Wang A.Z. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110,: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This provocative result raises the question of whether E-cadherin associates directly with either ankyrin or spectrin. We report here that E-cadherin binds directly to ankyrin-G and present evidence that this interaction is required for exit of E-cadherin from the trans-Golgi network and for maintenance at the lateral membrane of cultured epithelial cells. We also show that ankyrin-G and β-2-spectrin are required in early mouse embryos for compaction and accumulation of E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts. cDNA Constructs—cDNAs encoding human E-cadherin fused at the C terminus to either GFP 2The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinHBEhuman bronchial epithelialsiRNAsmall interfering RNAHAhemagglutininTGNtrans-Golgi networkshRNAsmall hairpin RNAGSTglutathione S-transferaseEC-CDE-cadherin cytoplasmic domainWTwild type.or three copies of the HA tag were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques. cDNAs encoding E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and β-catenin were inserted into a pGEX6P1-7 His bacterial expression vector (13Lee G. Abdi K. Jiang Y. Michaely P. Bennett V. Marszalek P.E. Nature. 2006; 440,: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) for protein expression and purification. Four E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain polypeptides with progressive C-terminal deletions were generated by terminating the coding sequence at amino acid 772, 813, 831, or 862, where amino acids are numbered based on the E-cadherin propeptide amino acid sequence. cDNA encoding repeats 14-16 of β-2-spectrin containing the ankyrin binding site (amino acids 1669-1991) was introduced into the pET15b vector.

A pFIV H1 (SBI Systems) vector was used to express shRNA against mouse ankyrin-G and mouse β-2-spectrin in experiments with early embryos. The following sequences were targeted: ankyrin-G (NM 170728), GGGATTGCGTCCGTCCATC; β-2-spectrin (NM 175836), TGGTTAAAGCATCAAGCA. Corresponding control siRNAs were generated by introducing mutations into the siRNA sequence at three wobble nucleotide positions (underlined) to make them nonfunctional: ankyrin-G, GGGATCGCTTCGGTCCATC; β-2-spectrin, TGGTTAAAGCTTCGAGCA. In Vitro Interaction Assays with Purified Proteins—Histidine-tagged human 220-kDa ankyrin-B was expressed using the BacPak baculovirus protein expression system (Clontech) and purified as described (14Abdi K.M. Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281,: 5741-5749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G was expressed and isolated in a similar fashion to ankyrin-B. Recombinant β-catenin was expressed in BL21 bacteria as a fusion protein with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag at the N terminus and a heptahistidine tag at the C terminus. The β-catenin fusion protein was first isolated on Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose followed by purification on glutathione-Sepharose beads. This two-step protocol ensures the purification of the full-length β-catenin polypeptide. The GST tag fused to β-catenin was removed by Precision protease treatment, and the β-catenin polypeptide was further purified using anion exchange chromatography. Histidine-tagged β-2-spectrin (repeats 14-16, including the ankyrin binding site) was isolated on Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose and then purified by anion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain polypeptides (wild type, truncations, and point mutants) were expressed as fusion proteins with the GST tag at the N terminus and a heptahistidine tag at the C terminus in BL21 Escherichia coli cells. The cytoplasmic domain polypeptides were first isolated on Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose. Then the isolated cytoplasmic polypeptides fused to GST (GST-E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain; GST-EC-CD) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose for binding studies. In vitro protein interaction studies were performed as described (14Abdi K.M. Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281,: 5741-5749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, either GST-EC-CD or GST immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with a candidate binding partner in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, either 50 or 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following incubation, the glutathione beads were pelleted (at 5000 × g for 15 min), and proteins bound to the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Relative levels of ankyrin-G and EC-CD in individual complexes were determined as follows. Stained protein bands were cut from SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the Coomassie Blue dye was eluted using pyridine (25%). Relative levels of dye were measured based on absorbance at 650 nm. Binding stoichiometries expressed as mol of ankyrin bound/mol of GST-EC-CD were determined in each sample from the ratio of Coomassie Blue associated with each polypeptide and were calculated based on relative molecular weights of ankyrins and GST-EC-CD, with the assumption that these proteins bind equivalent amounts of dye per microgram. Ankyrin-G was used at 0.5 μm in experiments designed to determine binding to mutant EC-CD. In all other experiments, ankyrin-G, β-catenin, and β-spectrin were used at 1 μm. Cellular Assays—The HEK 293-based plasma membrane recruitment assay used to study the interaction of ankyrin-G and E-cadherin in cells has been described (15Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273,: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells (80,000 cells) were plated on the 1.4-mm diameter coverslips of a Matek plate and then co-transfected with 150 ng of wild type or mutant E-cadherin-3HA and 100 ng of 190-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP using Effectene (6.25 μgin200 μl; Qiagen). Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and processed for immunofluorescence with an anti-HA (1 μg/ml) antibody and anti-GFP antibody (1 μg/ml) 18-20 h following transfection. Human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) were cultured as described (2Kizhatil K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 16706-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Lateral membrane heights of cells grown for various time points were determined after fixation using E-cadherin as a marker for the lateral membrane. Cells grown on Matek plates were depleted of ankyrin-G or β-2-spectrin by transfecting HBE cells with 1 μg of the respective siRNA plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000 as described (2Kizhatil K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 16706-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (see supplemental materials for more details). E-cadherin-3HA plasmid DNA (150 ng; wild type or mutant) was transfected into HBE cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (450 ng in 200 μl). Embryo Injections—One-cell embryos were isolated from superovulated B6SJLF1/J mice and allowed to develop to the two-cell stage at 37 °C in KSOM medium (Speciality Media) under 5% CO2. 2 pl of a 3:1 mixture of shRNA plasmid and pCAGGS-GFP at a final concentration of 10 ng/μl was injected into one cell of the two-cell embryo using fire-polished glass needles attached to a TL1-100 Micromanipulator (Harvard Apparatus). The injected embryos were cultured for another 40 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Embryos were screened by phase-contrast light microscopy, and those that were dead following the 40-h incubation were removed. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Three-dimensional Rendering—Immunofluorescence and laser-scanning confocal microscopy were performed as described (2Kizhatil K. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Three-dimensional rendering of confocal Z-stacks collected at 0.2-μm intervals was performed using the Volocity 4.0 software (Improvision) with the three-dimensional rendering option set to opacity. Overlap of voxels representing organelle markers with voxels representing intracellular E-cadherin was calculated from three-dimensional renderings of confocal stacks of cells labeled for E-cadherin and marker protein using the co-localization function. The rabbit polyclonal affinity-purified antibodies against ankyrin-G, β-2-spectrin, and GFP have been described (2Kizhatil K. Bennett V. J. Biol.

The following antibodies were obtained commercially: rat anti-E-cadherin (Sigma), mouse anti-golgin-97 (Invitrogen), mouse anti-giantin (EMD Biosciences), mouse anti-EEA1 (BD Biosciences), and chicken anti-HA (Aves Laboratory). Dextran uptake in cells was performed as described before (16Shurety W. Stewart N.L. Stow J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9,: 957-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells transfected with siRNA were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.05% bovine serum albumin 18 h after transfection and then incubated with 1 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (Mini Emerald, Mr = 10,000; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed further and then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence as described before (2Kizhatil K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 16706-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3Kizhatil K. Yoon W. Mohler P.J. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—HBE cells grown on Matek plates were transfected with 600 ng of either WT or R748D/D749R E-cadherin pEGFPN1 with Lipofectamine 2000 (1.8 μgin200 μl). 18-20 h after transfection, the cells form a monolayer where the transfected E-cadherin localize to cell-cell junctions. Cells were visualized using an Apochromat ×100 numerical aperture 1.40 objective on a LSM 5 live duo scan confocal system. Images of cells were collected at five time points before photobleaching using a 488-nm laser. Images were obtained every second following bleaching for 3 min. Fluorescence intensities from the bleached region of the cell, the whole cell, and background region were obtained for each time point using the LSM 4.0 software. Fluorescence intensities over time following bleach were normalized using Phair's double normalization technique. In this method, the ratio of background-subtracted fluorescence intensities during recovery and background-subtracted average prebleach fluorescence intensity is corrected for acquisition bleaching. The normalized fluorescence intensities were plotted against time to obtain a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching recovery curve. The curve was then fitted using the single exponential equation, y = yo + Ae-bx. The mobile fraction was calculated according the equation, Mob =-A/(1 - (yo + A)). The half-time was calculated using-ln 0.5/b. Ankyrin-G Recruits β-2-Spectrin to an E-cadherin-β-Catenin Complex in Vitro—Based on the report that E-cadherin co-immunoprecipitates with ankyrin and spectrin (12Nelson W.J. Shore E.M. Wang A.Z. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110,: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) as well as functional experiments (see below), we directly evaluated interaction of ankyrin-G with the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin using purified recombinant proteins. Ankyrin-G associated with GST-E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain that was immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, whereas ankyrin-B exhibited only minimal binding under identical conditions (Fig. 1A). Increasing concentrations of ankyrin-G bound to the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain in a saturable manner at close to 1:1 molar stoichiometry, with half-maximal binding at 0.5 μm (Fig. 1B). We also evaluated binding of E-cadherin to ankyrins in a cell-based assay where GFP-tagged proteins are recruited to the plasma membrane when co-expressed with membrane protein binding partners (Fig. 1C) (15Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273,: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ankyrin-G-GFP in 293 cells was present in the cytoplasm when expressed alone but was confined to the plasma membrane when co-expressed with E-cadherin (Fig. 1C). In contrast, ankyrin-B-GFP remained cytoplasmic in the presence of E-cadherin (Fig. 1C). The fact that ankyrin-G is markedly more active than ankyrin-B in binding to E-cadherin, although these proteins are closely related in sequence and isoelectric point, indicates that the interaction is highly specific. We next determined the site in the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain required for binding of ankyrin-G. Ankyrin-G associated with N-cadherin equivalently to E-cadherin (data not shown), indicating that ankyrin binding may be a conserved feature of type 1 classical cadherins. We found, using a series of truncations, that the juxtamembrane 41 amino acids (amino acids 732-773) of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail were sufficient for ankyrin binding (supplemental Fig. S1). We performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis within the minimal ankyrin-G binding region of the complete E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and focused on clusters of charged residues conserved between E-cadherin and N-cadherin (Fig. 2A). These mutations resulted in loss of binding to ankyrin-G, ranging from 30 to 40% for residues 738-750 to 60% for residues 756-764. These results, considered with the intrinsically unstructured fold of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (17Huber A.H. Stewart D.B. Laurents D.V. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276,: 12301-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), indicate an extended ankyrin-binding site distributed along at least 26 residues (Fig. 2B). We next evaluated interaction of ankyrin-G and E-cadherin in the context of physiological binding partners for each protein. β-Catenin associates with the C-terminal 100 residues of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin, which are distinct from the juxtamembrane binding site for ankyrin-G (18Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105,: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 19Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell Regul. 1989; 1,: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 20Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8,: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). We determined directly whether ankyrin-G and β-catenin could simultaneously associate with E-cadherin, as expected from their separate binding sites (Fig. 2A). Ankyrin-G associated with the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail complexed with β-catenin in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry, the same as with E-cadherin alone, although the affinity was reduced about 1.5-fold (Fig. 3A). We next asked if ankyrin-G could bind simultaneously to β-2-spectrin and the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex. Again, ankyrin-G associated equivalently to E-cadherin-β-catenin in the presence and absence of recombinant β-2-spectrin (repeats 14-16 containing the ankyrin-binding site). β-2-Spectrin was present in sufficient concentrations to form a 1:1 complex with ankyrin-G (Fig. 3B). β-2-Spectrin exhibited no binding to E-cadherin-β-catenin in the absence of ankyrin-G (Fig. 3B). A small amount of bovine serum albumin (present in the assay at 5 mg/ml to reduce nonspecific binding) remains in all samples, including those with GST alone (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that ankyrin-G can recruit β-2-spectrin to an E-cadherin-β-catenin complex. The ability of ankyrin-G to form a ternary complex is in contrast to α-catenin, which can associate either with β-catenin or actin but not both proteins at the same time (21Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Cell. 2005; 123,: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Impaired Cellular Localization of E-cadherin with Reduced Ankyrin-G Binding—We determined the cellular consequences of mutations of E-cadherin that reduce its ankyrin-G binding activity. Binding sites of p120-catenin and ankyrin-G overlap in residues 756-764 (Fig. 2A) (22Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148,: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, the R748A/D749A mutation that reduces ankyrin-G binding is N-terminal to the binding site for p120-catenin (22Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148,: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Moreover, even a triple alanine mutation of R748A/D749A/N750A did not affect binding of p120-catenin (22Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148,: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We further increased the specificity of this mutation by performing a charge reversal of RD to DR, thus preserving the isoelectric point. Interestingly, RD residues at this site are conserved in nematode and Drosophila as well as other vertebrate type 1 cadherins (Fig. 2A). R748D/D749R and R748A/D749A mutations of E-cadherin exhibited a similar reduction in binding to ankyrin-G (Fig. 2B). We determined the fate of HA-tagged R748D/D749R E-cadherin and R748A/D749A E-cadherin expressed in human bronchial epithelial cells. R748D/D749R E-cadherin accumulated primarily in a subapical intracellular compartment and only to a limited extent in the lateral membrane (Fig. 4A). Representative cells are shown in xy and xz planes. R748D/D749R E-cadherin exhibited marked intracellular localization in 200 of 200 cells (not shown). Identical results were obtained with the R748A/D749A mutant E-cadherin (supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast, HA-tagged wild type E-cadherin expressed under identical conditions was entirely confined to the lateral membrane in over 95% of cells (Fig. 4A). Intracellular R748D/D749R E-cadherin partially co-localized in three dimensions with structures that co-labeled with a marker for the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Fig. 4A). We next evaluated the effect of the R748D/D749R mutation on the dynamic behavior of GFP-tagged E-cadherin expressed on the lateral membrane in confluent HBE cells. This was achieved by measuring fluorescence recovery of GFP-tagged E-cadherin after photobleaching (Fig. 4B). R748D/D749R E-cadherin-GFP compared with wild type E-cadherin-GFP exhibited a 2.2-fold increase in the mobile fraction from 0.35 ± 0.1 to 0.79 ± 0.14. A 1.2-fold decrease in the time for half-maximal recovery from 60 ± 1.6 s for wild type E-cadherin to 50 ± 3 s for the mutant E-cadherin (n = 4) was also determined. A representative curve of recovery of fluorescence is shown in Fig. 4B. Together, these experiments demonstrate that R748D/D749R E-cadherin exhibits both impaired exit from the TGN and increased mobility on the lateral membrane. Given that the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain is intrinsically unstructured (17Huber A.H. Stewart D.B. Laurents D.V. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276,: 12301-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the R748D/D749R mutation is unlikely to affect folding. Therefore, altered behavior of R748D/D749R E-cadherin may result from loss of ankyrin-G binding. E-cadherin contains an atypical dileucine motif within the ankyrin-binding site in the juxtamembrane domain, which has been proposed to function as a basolateral targeting signal (23Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Teasdale R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276,: 22565-22572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We found that LL/AA mutation of this motif had no effect on binding to ankyrin-G, either with pure proteins or in the cell recruitment assay (Fig. 5, A and B). However, we also found that the LL/AA mutant E-cadherin was targeted to the lateral membrane when expressed at physiological levels and only mislocalized to the apical surface when highly expressed (Fig. 5C). Similar findings have been reported for LL/AA-mutated E-cadherin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and were interpreted as evidence for a role of the dileucine motif in endocytosis (24Miyashita Y. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282,: 11540-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). E-cadherin apparently can independently associate with either ankyrin-G or the endocytosis machinery through an overlapping interaction surface provided by its intrinsically unstructured cytoplasmic domain. Exit of E-cadherin from the TGN Requires Ankyrin-G and β-2-Spectrin—We wanted to further evaluate roles of ankyrin-G and its partner β-2-spectrin in determining cellular behavior of E-cadherin. Conventional wisdom would predict that the principal function of an ankyrin-spectrin skeleton is to immobilize E-cadherin and prevent its recycling through endocytosis (7Piepenhagen P.A. Nelson W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9,: 3161-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In support of a retention function for ankyrin-G, R748D/D749R E-cadherin-GFP, which has reduced ankyrin-G-binding activity, also has increased mobility in the lateral membrane (Fig. 4A). In order to directly evaluate roles of ankyrin-G and its partner β-2-spectrin in stabilizing E-cadherin at the lateral membrane, we knocked down ankyrin-G and β-2-spectrin in human bronchial epithelial cells using plasmids encoding siRNAs for these proteins, as previously described (2Kizhatil K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 16706-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3Kizhatil K. Yoon W. Mohler P.J. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Bennett V. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2085021614,"Several studies have demonstrated that the mammalian retina contains an autonomous circadian clock. Dopaminergic and other inner retinal neurons express many of the clock genes, whereas some of these genes seem to be absent from the photoreceptors. This observation has led to the suggestion that in mammalian retina the circadian pacemaker driving retinal rhythms is located in the inner nuclear layer. However, other evidence points to the photoreceptor layer as the site of the mammalian retinal clock. The goal of the present study was to demonstrate the presence of a functional circadian clock in photoreceptors. First, using laser capture microdissection and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we investigated which of the clock genes are expressed in rat photoreceptors. We then prepared photoreceptor layer cultures from the retina to test whether these isolated cultures were viable and could drive circadian rhythms. Our data indicated that Per1, Per3, Cry1, Cry2, Clock, Bmal1, Rev-erb alpha, and Rora RNAs were present in the photoreceptors, whereas we were unable to amplify mRNA for Per2 and Npas2. Photoreceptor layers obtained from Period1-luciferase rats expressed a robust circadian rhythm in bioluminescence and melatonin synthesis. These results demonstrate that mammalian photoreceptors contain the circadian pacemaker driving rhythmic melatonin synthesis."

This molecule acts as a potent transcriptional coactivator via functional interactions with nuclear receptors (PPARα, β/δ, γ; ERRα/β) and other DNA-binding proteins (e.g. nuclear respiratory factor-1/2). There are three known PGC-1 coactivators in mammals: PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and PGC-1-related coactivator. Both PGC-1α and PGC-1β are preferentially expressed in tissues with high oxidative metabolism, including heart, skeletal muscle, liver, brown adipose tissue, brain, and kidney, whereas PGC-1-related coactivator is ubiquitously expressed. Transcription of PGC-1α is highly inducible in response to physiological stimuli that increase energy demand, such as cold exposure in brown adipose tissues, fasting in liver, and exercise in skeletal muscles (1Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). In addition to the potent induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory function, PGC-1 activates diverse tissue-specific functions, including gluconeogenesis in liver, adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissues, and preferential fatty acid utilization and oxidation in the heart. Deletion of PGC-1α in mice demonstrated that it plays an important role in tissue-specific regulation of metabolic pathways (2Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y.

Remarkably, PGC-1α knock-out mice appear normal in terms of mitochondrial number and respiratory function in the unstressed condition. However, in response to diverse metabolic stresses, PGC-1α is critical for activating mitochondrial respiration and metabolism to maintain homeostasis. For example, although cardiac function in PGC-1α knock-out mice seems to be normal at rest, isolated PGC-1α-deficient hearts show an impaired ability to increase heart rates and cardiac output to the levels observed in wild-type mice when stimulated with inotropic reagents (4Arany Z. He H. Lin J. Hoyer K. Handschin C. Toka O. Ahmad F. Matsui T. Chin S. Wu P.H. Rybkin II Shelton J.M. Manieri M. Cinti S. Schoen F.J. Bassel-Duby R. Rosenzweig A. Ingwall J.S. Spiegelman B.M.

Consistent with this observation, reduced PGC-1α expression predisposes hearts to failure in response to mechanical stress induced by transverse aortic constriction (5Sano M. Wang S.C. Shirai M.

The primary structure of PGC-1α suggests a separation into two distinct regions. The N-terminal region contains a transcriptional activation domain, through which PGC-1α recruits histone acetyltransferase protein complexes, such as CBP/p300 and SRC-1. It also contains binding sites for nuclear receptors and other DNA-binding transcription factors. Notably, the N-terminal half of PGC-1α is sufficient for activating the PGC-1α-responsive promoter to the same degree as full-length PGC-1α. In contrast, the C-terminal region of PGC-1α contains a unique domain alignment not apparent in other nuclear hormone-receptor coactivators that includes serine-arginine-rich (RS) domains and an RNA recognition motif (RRM) (8Graveley B.R. RNA (N.Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). These structural features are characteristic of SR proteins, which facilitate spliceosome formation and orchestrate splice site selection. It is therefore likely that the C-terminal region of PGC-1α is involved in mRNA processing. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstrated physical interaction of the C-terminal half of PGC-1α with the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II, positive transcription elongation factor-b (Cdk9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9)-cyclin T), and RNA processing factors (9Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Both the protein expression and activity of PGC-1 must be tightly regulated to maintain the temporal and tissue-specific control of mitochondrial function in response to diverse metabolic demands, resulting in a necessarily short half-life. The signaling for induction of PGC-1α at the mRNA levels has been well studied (10Sano M.

PGC-1α is a highly potent inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Prolonged activation of PGC-1α may therefore not be permissive and possibly even pathogenic. Constitutive cardiac specific PGC-1α overexpression resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy with disruption of sarcomeric structures via the uncontrolled proliferation of mitochondria (16Lehman J.J.

It is generally thought that the levels of potent transcriptional activator proteins must be limited due to their cytotoxicity, and inverse correlations between intracellular levels of proteins and their potency as transcriptional activator have been demonstrated (17Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This study showed that the expression levels of PGC-1α are controlled by protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that PGC-1α is inherently prone to aggregation. Both proteasome inhibition and truncation of N-terminal regulatory motifs facilitated intranuclear aggregation of this protein. In addition, intramolecular interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions regulated PGC-1α coactivator function by controlling protein stability and intranuclear localization.

Poellinger (Karolinska Institute, Sweden); GAL4-VP16, K. Umesono (Kyoto University, Japan). Cell Fractionation—To prepare nuclear and cytosolic extracts, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 μm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mix). The swollen cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was extracted in a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mix), and the soluble fraction was collected as nuclear extracts following another centrifugation. The remaining insoluble pellet was resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and solubilized by sonication on ice. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against FLAG, HA, PGC-1α, and MAT1 as well as mouse monoclonal antibodies against PML and Gal4 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Goat polyclonal antibody against lamin B was also purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and a mouse monoclonal antibody against NuMA was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. For coimmunoprecipitation, nuclear proteins were resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mix) and incubated with FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma). The bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Protein expression was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and detected using a LAS-3000 luminescence image analyzer (FUJIFILM). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were cotransfected in 6-well plates with expression vectors, firefly luciferase reporter genes (0.1 μg), and a constitutive Renilla luciferase control (pRL-CMV; 50 ng; Promega) using Trans IT-LT1 (Mirus). Luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection, using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer. All transfections comprised three or more independent experiments, each in duplicate. Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells or cardiomyocytes were plated onto glass coverslips in a 6-well plate. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were then washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Permeabilized cells were then blocked for 30 min with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton-X in Tris-buffered saline). Cells were stained with primary antibodies against FLAG (1:10,000; Sigma), anti-α-actinin (1:800; Sigma), or PGC-1α (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with either AlexaFluor 488 or TRITC (1:200; Dako Cytomation) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with ToPro3 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in mounting medium. The stained cells were observed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), with appropriate emission filters. Statistical Analyses—Data are reported as mean ± S.E. Comparisons were analyzed by analysis of variance, using a significance level of p < 0.05. Proteasome Inhibition Stabilizes PGC-1 Protein and Docks It in an Insoluble Subnuclear Compartment—Initially, this study examined how PGC-1α protein stability might be regulated. A number of other rapidly degraded proteins contain stretches of amino acids enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine, termed PEST domains, and these regions have been implicated in promoting protein turnover (20Rechsteiner M. Revis. Biol. Celular. 1989; 20: 235-253PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the human PGC-1α protein sequence using a PEST-FIND program identified two putative PEST sequences with high scores (11.45 and 9.98, respectively), one located in the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (amino acids 70-146) and the other located between amino acids 255-270 (Fig. 1A). PGC-1 orthologs are found to be limited in higher vertebrates, such as mammals, birds, and fish. As shown in Fig. 1B, the two identified PEST-like motifs are highly preserved in PGC-1 orthologs of humans, pigs, rats, chickens, puffer fish, and zebrafish. This observation led us to further investigate whether degradation of PGC-1 is coupled to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We approached this by monitoring protein levels of PGC-1α after treatment with proteasome inhibitors. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected to express FLAG-tagged PGC-1α and cultured in the presence of a reversible proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Nuclear extracts were obtained from these cells at different time points after the addition of MG132 and then subjected to Western blotting. PGC-1α protein levels in the nuclear extracts were increased by at least 5-fold at 1 h after treating the cells with MG132 relative to untreated cells (Fig. 2A, top). Surprisingly, longer incubations with MG132 decreased PGC-1α protein levels in a time-dependent manner. Given that protein degradation is blocked by proteasome inhibition, this paradoxical reduction of PGC-1α protein in the nuclear extracts raised the possibility that PGC-1α might translocate into specific subnuclear compartments, where it is tightly bound to a structure such as the nuclear matrix, thus rendering it insoluble and not subject to degradation. Based on this idea, we analyzed the pellet remaining after preparation of the nuclear extract, which contained insoluble nuclear proteins resistant to extraction in buffer containing high salt (400 mm NaCl) and nonionic detergent. The pellet was resuspended in SDS lysis buffer, solubilized by sonication (referred to hereafter as the nuclear pellet fraction), and then immunoblotted in parallel with the nuclear extracts. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2A, the untreated nuclear pellet showed no PGC-1α activity. Following MG132 treatment, however, the protein levels of PGC-1α in the nuclear pellet gradually increased until they had almost recovered at 6 h after the addition of MG132. Similarly, treatment with lactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor, increased the levels of PGC-1α protein in the nuclear extracts initially, followed by a gradual decrease with a reciprocal increase in the nuclear pellet levels. 4M.

Transiently expressed PGC-1β in COS-7 cells exhibited similar behavior in response to proteasome inhibition (Fig. 2B). The fidelity of our cell fractionation procedure was verified by the absence of MAT-1 (Ménageà-trois-1) in the nuclear pellet, whereas NuMA (nuclear matrix marker nuclear mitotic apparatus protein) was absent in the nuclear extracts (21Sun Q.Y. Schatten H. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Taken together, such dynamic behavior of PGC-1 following inhibition of proteasome activity was ascribed to a subnuclear compartment shift. To confirm that this shift occurred with endogenous PGC-1α, the same biochemical fractionation was performed using cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. As shown in Fig. 2C, significant levels of endogenous PGC-1α were detected in the nuclear pellet when the cardiomyoctes were preincubated with MG132 (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2PGC-1α protein is stabilized and subsequently made insoluble by proteasome inhibition. A, COS-7 cells transiently expressing FLAG-PGC-1α were treated with MG132 (5 μm) for the indicated periods of time. Protein fractions were prepared from the nuclear extracts (NE) and nuclear pellet (NP) and subjected to Western blotting. B, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-PGC-1α or -β vector, and the expressed protein was detected by anti-FLAG antibodies. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-NuMA (nuclear matrix protein) and anti-MAT-1-specific antibodies. C, endogenous PGC-1α protein in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was determined by anti-PGC-1α antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Proteasome Inhibition Protects PGC-1α from Proteolysis but Changes the Intranuclear Distribution Pattern—Next, we examined the dynamic behavior of intranuclear PGC-1α by immunocytochemistry using laser confocal microscopy. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-PGC-1α expression plasmid and analyzed by immunofluorescence staining using an anti-FLAG antibody. In the absence of MG132, PGC-1α showed a diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution with concentrated staining in fine speckles (Fig. 3A, left). Treatment of the cells with MG132 for 16 h drastically altered the distribution of PGC-1α staining into multiple large speckles or aggregates (Fig. 3A, right). We next immunolocalized endogenous PGC-1α in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes following proteasome inhibition to exclude the possibility of the changed staining pattern being due to protein overexpression. In the absence of MG132, endogenous PGC-1α showed a fine speckled pattern throughout the nucleoplasm, whereas treatment with MG132 caused the formation of discrete nuclear foci stained for PGC-1α (Fig. 3B). Although these foci were fewer in number and smaller in size than those observed in the transfected COS-7 cells, these results supported the notion that PGC-1α dynamically shifts its subnuclear location upon proteasome inhibition. To examine the effect of protein synthesis on the steady-state levels of PGC-1α, COS-7 cells were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit de novo protein synthesis 24 h after transfection with FLAG-PGC-1α and observed at various time points up to 5 h. The intensity of PGC-1α immunofluorescent signals rapidly decreased to undetectable levels by 5 h after cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 3C, upper panels). Similar results were observed with endogenous PGC-1α in rat cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3D), strongly indicating the requirement of ongoing protein synthesis to maintain steady-state levels of PGC-1α protein. Proteasome inhibition with MG132 eventually changed the fine speckled diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution of PGC-1α to the distinctive concentration in large speckles, most possibly via protection of PGC-1α from proteolysis (Fig. 3C, lower panels). In contrast, neither the staining intensity nor pattern of an irrelevant protein, such as Cdk9 (22Sano M. Abdellatif M. Oh H. Xie M. Bagella L. Giordano A. Michael L.H. DeMayo F.J. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), was affected by treatment with cycloheximide and/or MG132 during the same time course. 4M. Sano, S. Tokudome, N. Shimizu, N. Yoshikawa, C. Ogawa, K. Shirakawa, J. Endo, T. Katayama, S. Yuasa, M. Ieda, S. Makino, F. Hattori, H. Tanaka, and K. Fukuda, unpublished observations. We therefore concluded that the nuclear distribution of PGC-1α is dynamically regulated under certain circumstances, such as proteasome inhibition, such that it shifts from its nucleoplasm-predominant location to dense large speckles within the nucleus. Moreover, this type of intranuclear compartment shift might be coupled to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. PGC-1α Is Degraded via the Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway—We next asked which subnuclear compartment of PGC-1 is targeted for ubiquitination. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed significant overlap of ubiquitin staining with the fine speckled pattern of PGC-1α throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. 4A). In the presence of MG132, the accumulated PGC-1α protein in the larger nuclear speckles also colocalized with ubiquitin staining (Fig. 4B). To examine the ubiquitination state of PGC-1α biochemically, COS-7 cells overexpressing FLAG-PGC-1α and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin either in the presence or absence of MG132 were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-agarose and then analyzed for the presence of ubiquitination using Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 4C, higher molecular weight bands representing polyubiquitinated PGC-1α were detected in the presence of MG132. Together, these results demonstrated that the PGC-1α localized in fine speckles throughout the nucleoplasm is targeted for ubiquitination. Inhibition of the proteasome triggers the relocation of polyubiquitinated PGC-1α into the large nuclear speckles, where the protein is tightly complexed and not easily extracted. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies are tightly bound to the nuclear matrix and are enriched in multiple components of the proteasome and ubiquitinated proteins (23Lafarga M. Berciano M.T. Pena E. Mayo I. Castano J.G. Bohmann D. Rodrigues J.P. Tavanez J.P. Carmo-Fonseca M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2771-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, we also colocalized polyubiquitinated PGC-1α with PML, confirming these compartments as nuclear bodies (Fig. 4D). N- and C-terminal Parts of PGC-1α Cooperatively Regulate Proteolysis and Localization via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway—The results thus far suggested that both degradation and subnuclear localization of PGC-1α are tightly coupled to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. To further delineate the domains of PGC-1α regulating these phenomena, we constructed a panel of C- and N-terminal deletion mutants of PGC-1α, depicted in Figs. 5A and 6A. The N-terminal region of PGC-1α contains functional domains for transcription initiation, including transcriptional activation domains and the binding sites for transcription factors. The C terminus of PGC-1α contains two RS domains and an RRM, through which PGC-1α is proposed to act in mRNA processing of target genes during transcriptional elongation (9Monsalve M. Wu Z.

A, Schematic representation of N-terminal deletion mutants of PGC-1α. B and C, COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length or deletion mutants of PGC-1α. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or MG132 for 16 h. Protein fractions derived from the nuclear extracts or nuclear pellet were subjected to Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies. D, COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-PGC-1α-(565-798) and HA-tagged ubiquitin. FLAG-PGC-1-(565-798) was immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-FLAG-agarose and then analyzed for the presence of ubiquitination by Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies (left).

Bars, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) First, we examined the effect of C-terminal deletions on the subcellular localization, protein stability, and ubiquitination status of PGC-1α. Although full-length PGC-1α protein was exclusively localized in the nucleoplasm, the RS/RRM deletion mutant PGC-1α-(1-565) was present in both cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, and further deletion toward the N-terminal end (residues 1-292) completely abrogated the nuclear localization (Fig. 5B, upper panels). These findings together with the fact that a C-terminal fragment of PGC-1α-(565-798) remained exclusively localized in the nucleus implied that at least one functional nuclear localization signal exists in the C-terminal region. Consistent with the immunofluorescent staining, Western blotting showed PGC-1α-(1-565) distributed equally between the cytosol and nuclear extract fractions, whereas the majority of PGC-1α-(1-292) protein was recovered in the cytosol fraction (Fig. 5C). The intensity of PGC-1α-(1-565) immunofluorescence was unchanged 5 h after cycloheximide treatment, whereas that of full-length PGC-1α was rapidly decreased (Figs. 3C and 5E). Truncation of the C-terminal RS/RRM region thus stabilized PGC-1α-(1-565) protein in the nucleus, and exposure of the cells to MG132 had no effect on the protein levels or subcellular distribution of PGC-1α-(1-565). In support of this, nucleoplasmic PGC-1α-(1-565) protein failed to form large speckles in the nucleus upon proteasome inhibition (Fig. 5B, lower panels). Furthermore, the ubiquitination of PGC-1α was blocked by deletion of the C-terminal RS/RRM region (Fig. 5D). We next examined the effects of N-terminal deletions of PGC-1α. N-terminal deletion mutants of PGC-1α-(565-798) were hardly detectable in nuclear extracts but wer"
https://openalex.org/W2022382468,"Background Long-term changes in synaptic plasticity require gene transcription, indicating that signals generated at the synapse must be transported to the nucleus. Synaptic activation of hippocampal neurons is known to trigger retrograde transport of transcription factor NF-κB. Transcription factors of the NF-κB family are widely expressed in the nervous system and regulate expression of several genes involved in neuroplasticity, cell survival, learning and memory. Principal Findings In this study, we examine the role of the dynein/dynactin motor complex in the cellular mechanism targeting and transporting activated NF-κB to the nucleus in response to synaptic stimulation. We demonstrate that overexpression of dynamitin, which is known to dissociate dynein from microtubules, and treatment with microtubule-disrupting drugs inhibits nuclear accumulation of NF-κB p65 and reduces NF-κB-dependent transcription activity. In this line, we show that p65 is associated with components of the dynein/dynactin complex in vivo and in vitro and that the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) within NF-κB p65 is essential for this binding. Conclusion This study shows the molecular mechanism for the retrograde transport of activated NF-κB from distant synaptic sites towards the nucleus."

Here, we describe a high-throughput system designed to identify cDNAs whose overexpression induces morphologically distinct cell death modalities. The methodology incorporates two robotized steps, and relies on coexpression of library clones with GFP to reveal the morphological features presented by the dying cells. By using this system we screened 135 000 cDNA clones and obtained 90 independent molecules. Interestingly, three death categories were identified, namely; apoptotic, vacuolated and autophagic. Among the pro-apoptotic clones, we found four members of the mitochondrial carrier family: the phosphate and adenine nucleotide (type 3) transporters, and the mitochondrial carrier homologs (MTCHs) 1 and 2. Expression of these molecules induced cytochrome c release and caspase-9-dependent death. One of them, the phosphate carrier, was able to interact with members of the permeability transition pore complex ANT1 and VDAC1, and its binding to ANT1 was stabilized in the presence of apoptotic activators. Depletion of this carrier by siRNA delayed cytochrome c mobilization and apoptosis. These results attribute a previously undescribed apoptotic function to the phosphate carrier and, more generally, suggest that a common property of various mitochondrial transporters was exploited during evolution to regulate apoptosis."

We further confirmed the mRNA regulation of 15 genes from this list by quantitative reverse transcription–PCR. Analysis of this list with statistical tools led to several conclusions: (1) there is a change in cell population with an increased expression of genes involved in the immune response, reflecting lymphocyte infiltration in the tumor compared to the normal tissue. (2) The c-jun N-terminal kinase pathway is activated by overexpression of its components. (3) The activation of ERKK1/2 by genetic alterations is supplemented by activation of the epidermal growth factor but not of the insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway.

Like the insulin receptor, the IGF-1 receptor is a heterotetrameric receptor tyrosine kinase, whereas the IGF-2/ mannose 6-phosphate receptor is a single transmembrane domain protein that is thought to function primarily as clearance receptors. We recently reported that IGF-1 and IGF-2 stimulate the ERK1/2 cascade by triggering sphingosine kinasedependent “transactivation” of G protein-coupled sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. To determine which IGF receptors mediate this effect, we tested seven insulin family peptides, IGF-1, IGF-2, insulin, and insulin-like peptides 3, 4, 6, and 7, for the ability to activate ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells. Only IGF-1 and IGF-2 potently activated ERK1/2. Although IGF-2 was predictably less potent than IGF-1 in activating the IGF-1 receptor, they were equipotent stimulators of ERK1/2. Knockdown of IGF-1 receptor expression by RNA interference reduced the IGF-1 response to a greater extent than the IGF-2 response, suggesting that IGF-2 did not signal exclusively via the IGF-1 receptor. In contrast, IGF-2 receptor knockdown markedly reduced IGF-2-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, with no effect on the IGF-1 response. As observed previously, both the IGF-1 and the IGF-2 responses were sensitive to pertussis toxin and the sphingosine kinase inhibitor, dimethylsphingosine.

IGF-1 and IGF-2 are single chain polypeptides, with sequences 62% identical to that of proinsulin. Both contain a short D domain that is not present in insulin, and unlike insulin, they do not undergo post-translational proteolysis, such that the A and B domains remain linked in the mature peptide by a C domain analogous to the C peptide of insulin (1LeRoith D.

IGF-1 and IGF-2 bind two structurally distinct types of receptor, referred to as the IGF-1 and IGF-2/mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors. The IGF-1 receptor is heterotetrameric transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is structurally and functionally related to the insulin receptor. It is composed of two extracellular α-subunits that contain the ligand-binding domain and two transmembrane β-subunits that possess intrinsic ligand-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity (3LeRoith D.

Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the prevailing opinion is that the biological effects of IGF-2 are predominantly mediated through the IGF-1 receptor or insulin receptor isoform A (21Werner H.

At least some of the recently characterized relaxin/insulinlike factors bind yet another class of membrane receptor, seven membrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). INSLs are composed of two peptide chains connected by three disulfide bonds and share a high degree of structural homology with insulin (24Lok S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Liu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 26Bartsch O. Bartlick B. Ivell R. Mol. Human Reprod. 2001; 7: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Based on this structural similarity, it was initially thought that INSLs would signal by binding to receptor tyrosine kinases, similar to the insulin and IGF receptors. Recently, however, it has been shown that relaxin activates a family of leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCRs, the relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptors, previously known as LGRs, and mediates heterotrimeric G protein-dependent activation of a number of effectors including adenylyl cyclase (26Bartsch O. Bartlick B. Ivell R. Mol. Human Reprod. 2001; 7: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Hsu S.Y. Nakabayashi K. Nishi S. Kumagai J. Kudo M. Sherwood O.D. Hsueh A.J.W.

Although insulin and IGF-1/2 do not appear to activate RXFP receptors to any significant extent, these results clearly broaden the signaling repertoire of peptides with homology to insulin. We recently reported that in HEK293 cells, exposure to IGF-1 or IGF-2 leads to activation of the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade through a mechanism involving sphingosine kinase (SK)-dependent “transactivation” of G protein-coupled sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors (31El-Shewy H.M.

Here, we sought to definitively identify the endogenous receptor(s) that mediate G protein-dependent ERK1/2 activation in response to IGF-1 and IGF-2 in HEK293 cells. Through selective silencing of IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P receptor expression, we find that although activation of the IGF-1 receptor is sufficient to account for the response to IGF-1, activation of ERK1/2 by IGF-2 occurs in large part through the IGF-2/M6P, independent of IGF-1 receptor expression. These data suggest that both IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P receptors play a physiologic role in the cellular response to IGFs and suggest that SK-dependent S1P receptor transactivation might serve as a general mechanism of heterotrimeric G protein-dependent signaling by multiple classes of non-GPCR.

Down-regulation of IGF-2 receptor was performed by targeting two different sites located 657 and 2050 nucleotides downstream of the start codon using sequence-specific siRNAs (5′-GGAGGUGCCAUGCUAUGUGtt-3′ and 5′-CACAUAGCAUGGCACCUCCtt-3′) for the first site and sequence-specific siRNAs (5′-GGGUUUUCUUUUGACUUAUtt-3′ and 5′-AUAAGUCAAAAGAAAACCCtg-3′) for the second site. Scrambled siRNA sequences (5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′) were used as negative controls. HEK293 cells were seeded in collagen-coated 10-cm dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/dish 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected using Gene Silencer® siRNA transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, cells were split into multiwell plates, as appropriate, and serum-deprived overnight in growth medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, prior to stimulation.

Agonist stimulations were for 10 min, after which monolayers were washed once in 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μlof Laemmli sample buffer. Samples containing 20 μg of cell protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. Proteins were detected with polyclonal IgG against ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, IGF-1 receptor, or IGF-1 receptor pY1158 as appropriate, with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody.

Total ERK1/2 was measured to confirm equal loading of the whole cell lysate samples. Immune complexes were visualized by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence and quantified using a Fluor-S MultiImager. IGF-1 and IGF-2, but Not Insulin or INSLs, Potently Activate ERK1/2 in HEK293 Cells—Insulin superfamily peptides interact with several classes of membrane receptor, and in some cases, a single peptide can bind to more than one receptor type. This is particularly the case for insulin, IGF-1 and IGF-2, each of which can bind to the IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin receptors (1LeRoith D. Jr.Roberts C.T. Cancer Lett. 2003; 195: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 2Dupont J. Holzenberger M. Birth Defects Res. 2003; 69: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Dupont J.

Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1050-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially tested a panel of insulin-like peptides for the ability to activate ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, IGF-1 and IGF-2 both potently activated endogenous ERK1/2, although IGF-1 was somewhat more efficacious at maximal concentrations. Insulin elicited a response only at high concentrations, consistent with effects mediated by low affinity binding to IGF-1 receptors (34Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J. Olfesky J.M.

The INSLs tested, INSL3, INSL4, INSL6, and INSL7, were inactive even at high concentrations, indicating that the G protein-coupled RXFP receptors are either not expressed or not coupled to ERK1/2 activation in this cell line. Since both IGF-1 and IGF-2 can activate the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase, we next compared the EC50 for IGF-1- and IGF-2-stimulated IGF-1 receptor activation with the EC50 of each for ERK1/2 activation. As shown in Fig. 2, IGF-2 was as efficacious but 2.3-fold less potent than IGF-1 at stimulating tyrosine autophosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor β-subunit. This is consistent with the reported lower affinity of IGF-2 binding to the IGF-1 receptor (32Dupont J. LeRoith D. Horm. Res. 2001; 55: 22-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 33Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1050-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In contrast, IGF-1 and IGF-2 were equipotent activators of ERK1/2, with EC50 values of 11.0 and 11.8 nm, respectively. This apparent discrepancy prompted us to consider the possibility that IGF-2 might mediate ERK1/2 activation through another receptor, particularly when present at concentrations that produced submaximal IGF-1 receptor activation. Down-regulating IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P Receptors Has Differential Effects on IGF-1- and IGF-2-stimulated ERK1/2 Activation—To test the hypothesis that both IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P receptors played a role in IGF-mediated ERK1/2 activation, we employed RNA interference to down-regulate endogenous receptor expression singly and in combination and determined the effect on the ability of IGF-1 and IGF-2 to activate ERK1/2. These assays employed concentrations of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (10 nm) that approximated the EC50 for ERK1/2 activation, at which concentration IGF-2 was less effective than IGF-1 at activating the IGF-1 receptor. Fig. 3, A and B, shows the effects of optimal IGF-1 receptor down-regulation (75 nm siRNA; 48 h after transfection). When compared with cells transfected with scrambled control siRNA, IGF-1 receptor mRNA levels measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR were reduced by 84%, which corresponded with an 87% reduction in receptor protein measured by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 3C, down-regulation of IGF-1 receptors reduced IGF-1- and IGF-2-stimulated IGF-1 receptor β-subunit phosphorylation by about 90%, proportional to the reduction in receptor level. As shown in Fig. 3D, IGF-1 receptor down-regulation significantly reduced ERK1/2 activation by both IGF-1 and IGF-2. As a percentage of the agonist-induced increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, the IGF-1 response was reduced by 77%, whereas the IGF-2 response decreased by 64%. Although these data clearly indicate that both IGF-1 and IGF-2 can engage the ERK1/2 cascade through the IGF-1 receptor, the finding that the IGF-2 response was less dependent upon IGF-1 receptor expression led us to test whether the IGF-2/M6P receptor also played a role in the response. Fig. 4 shows the effects of an identical set of experiments performed under conditions of IGF-2/M6P receptor down-regulation. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, optimal IGF-2/M6P receptor down-regulation (100 nm siRNA; 48 h) reduced IGF-2/M6P receptor mRNA and protein levels by 74 and 83%, respectively. Under these conditions, there was no change in the level of IGF-1 receptor expression or, as shown in Fig. 3C, IGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor β-subunit. IGF-1-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was unaffected by IGF-2/M6P receptor down-regulation. In striking contrast, IGF-2-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was reduced by 74%. Since the ability of IGF-2 to activate the IGF-1 receptor was unchanged in IGF-2/M6P receptor knockdown cells (Fig. 3C), the loss of signal probably represents loss of a direct IGF-2/M6P receptor-mediated signal and not decreased delivery of IGF-2 to the IGF-1 receptor. Fig. 5 shows the effects of simultaneous down-regulation of both the IGF-1 and the IGF-2/M6P receptors. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, simultaneous transfection of IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P receptor siRNAs down-regulated both receptors to a degree comparable with that achieved in the individual siRNA transfections. When compared with cells treated with scrambled control siRNA, IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P mRNA levels were reduced by 88 and 84%, respectively, with a 90% reduction in the expression of each receptor. Fig. 5C confirms that a comparable reduction in IGF-1- and IGF-2-stimulated IGF-1 receptor β-subunit phosphorylation was achieved. As shown in Fig. 5D, when both the IGF-1 and the IGF-2/M6P receptors were down-regulated simultaneously, the reduction in IGF-1-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was 86%, which was not significantly different from the 77% reduction achieved by IGF-1 receptor knockdown alone. In contrast, IGF-2-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was abolished when both receptors were down-regulated. The effects of down-regulating IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P receptor expression on IGF-1- and IGF-2-stimulated ERK1/2 activation are summarized in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6A, only IGF-1 receptor down-regulation affected IGF-1-stimulated ERK1/2 activation, and the degree of inhibition correlated closely with the extent of IGF-1 receptor knockdown. This result supports the conclusion that in HEK293 cells, the effects of IGF-1 are mediated almost exclusively through binding to the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase. In contrast, IGF-2-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was partially inhibited when either the IGF-1 or the IGF-2/M6P receptor was down-regulated independently and eliminated only when the two receptors were down-regulated together. These data support the conclusion that IGF-2 signals in part by binding to the IGF-1 receptor but also by binding to the IGF-2/M6P receptor. Moreover, the response mediated by the IGF-2/M6P receptor is independent of IGF-1 receptor since Fig. 4C clearly demonstrates that down-regulating IGF-2/M6P receptors has no effect on the ability of IGF-2 to activate the IGF-1 receptor. IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P Receptors Employ a Common Sphingosine Kinase-dependent Mechanism to Regulate ERK1/2 Activity—We recently demonstrated that IGFs can activate ERK1/2 through a novel mechanism involving SK-dependent transactivation of heterotrimeric G protein-coupled S1P receptors (31El-Shewy H.M. Johnson K.R. Lee M.-H. Jaffa A.A. Obeid L.M. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31399-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine whether signals transmitted via the IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P receptors employed the same or different mechanisms, we exposed HEK293 cells to EC50 concentrations of IGF-1 or IGF-2 in the presence or absence of either DMS, an inhibitor of SK activity, or pertussis toxin (PTX), which inactivates Gi/o family heterotrimeric G proteins. As shown in Fig. 7A, DMS treatment eliminated both IGF-1-stimulated and IGF-2-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, consistent with a requirement for SK activity in the action of both receptors. ERK1/2 activation in response to S1P was unaffected, confirming that the DMS-sensitive step in the pathway was upstream of the S1P receptor. ERK1/2 activation by PMA, which causes protein kinase C-dependent ERK1/2 activation at the level of c-Raf1 (37Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), was likewise unaffected. Fig. 7B shows the effects of PTX on IGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. Consistent with our previous observations (31El-Shewy H.M. Johnson K.R. Lee M.-H. Jaffa A.A. Obeid L.M. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

PMA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was not affected. The incomplete inhibition produced by PTX probably results from coupling of S1P receptors to PTX-insensitive Gq/11 family heterotrimeric G proteins in addition to Gi/o family G proteins since we have observed that PTX and a Gq/11 inhibitor peptide additively inhibit S1P-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in HEK293 cells (31El-Shewy H.M.

Rockman H.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that two distinct receptor types, the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase and the catalytically inactive IGF-2/M6P receptor, share a common mechanism of intracellular signaling involving SK-dependent transactivation of S1P receptors. Having recently found that IGFs can initiate heterotrimeric G protein-dependent signals by a mechanism involving SK activation and S1P-dependent transactivation of G protein-coupled S1P receptors (31El-Shewy H.M. Johnson K.R. Lee M.-H. Jaffa A.A. Obeid L.M. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31399-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the major goal of this study was to determine which receptor(s) mediate the response. The insulin superfamily of peptides binds a structurally diverse cadre of receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases; the insulin and IGF-1 receptors, a non-catalytic type 1 transmembrane receptor; the IGF-2/M6P receptor and several heptahelical GPCRs; and the RXFP receptors. Therefore, we first tested a broad panel of insulin family peptides for the ability to activate ERK1/2 in untransfected HEK293 cells. Although both IGF-1 and IGF-2 potently activated ERK1/2, the RXFP ligands, INSL3, INSL4, INSL6, and INSL7, did not. Consistent with published reports that despite structural homology, insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 do not activate RXFPs (26Bartsch O. Bartlick B. Ivell R. Mol. Human Reprod. 2001; 7: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Hsu S.Y. Nakabayashi K. Nishi S. Kumagai J. Kudo M. Sherwood O.D. Hsueh A.J.W.

Rev. 2006; 58: 7-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), our results indicate that IGF-1 and IGF-2 do not cause G protein-dependent ERK1/2 activation by binding directly to a known GPCR. We next employed siRNA down-regulation of IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P receptor expression to assign the IGF-1 and IGF-2 responses to one or more specific receptors. Predictably, we found that IGF-1 receptors are activated by both IGF-1 and IGF-2, albeit with different potency, and that IGF-1 receptors contribute to ERK1/2 activation in response to both ligands. Surprisingly, we found that down-regulating the IGF-2/M6P receptor selectively inhibited the response to IGF-2 but not IGF-1. Loss of IGF-2/M6P receptors had no effect on the ability of IGF-2 to activate the IGF-1 receptor, indicating that the IGF-2/M6P receptor was not acting simply to deliver IGF-2 to the cell surface. Furthermore, the effects of IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P receptor down-regulation on IGF-2-stimulated ERK1/2 activation were approximately additive, strongly suggesting that these two structurally distinct receptors independently contribute to IGF-2 signaling in HEK293 cells. The most accepted function of the IGF-2/M6P receptor is in the cellular uptake and degradation of peptides such as IGF-2, proliferin, and leukemia inhibitory factor (10Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 14Lee S.-J. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3521-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hawkes C. Kar S. J.

Cooper J.A. Brunner A.M. Lioubin M.N. Gentry L.E. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. Marqardt H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14211-14215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, some data support a role for the IGF-2/M6P receptor in IGF-2 signaling (19Braulke T. Tippmer S. Neher E. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rhabdomyosarcoma cells, IGF-2 stimulates cell migration, apparently by binding the IGF-2/M6P receptor (40Minniti C.P. Kohn E.C. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. Oh Y. Muller H.L. Rosenfeld R.G. Helman L.J. J.

Commun. 1988; 154: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). More recently, Leu27IGF-2, which binds preferentially to the IGF-2/M6P receptor, has been shown to stimulate pertussis toxin-sensitive, protein kinase C-dependent, protein phosphorylation and modulate central cholinergic receptor function (45Hawkes C. Jhamandas J.H. Harris K.H. Fu W. MacDonald R.G. Kar S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, previous attempts to ascribe specific signaling functions to the IGF-2/M6P receptor have been hampered by the fact that IGF-2 also binds and activates the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase. Indeed, several authors have suggested that the biological effects of IGF-2 are mediated through the IGF-1 receptor or insulin receptor isoform A (21Werner H. LeRoith D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 183-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Frasca F. Pandini G. Scalia P. Sciacca L. Mineo R. Costantino A. Goldfine I.D. Belfiore A. Vigneri R. Mol.

In our study, we find that down-regulation of IGF-2/M6P receptors leads to a marked reduction in IGF-2-stimulated, but not IGF-1-stimulated, ERK1/2 activation, consistent with signaling directly via the IGF-2/M6P receptor. Our results also indicate that IGF-1, acting via the IGF-1 receptor, and IGF-2, acting via both the IGF-1 and the IGF-2/M6P receptors, employ a common heterotrimeric G protein-dependent mechanism to activate ERK1/2. We have previously shown that both IGF-1 and IGF-2 promote membrane translocation and activation of SK1, increase intracellular and extracellular S1P levels, and activate G protein-coupled S1P receptors in HEK293 cells (31El-Shewy H.M. Johnson K.R. Lee M.-H. Jaffa A.A. Obeid L.M. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31399-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). What remains unclear is how these two structurally distinct receptors activate SK. In vitro studies have shown that SK1 has high affinity for lipid bilayers rich in phosphatidylserine and that conserved Thr54 and Asn89 residues in the putative membrane-binding surface of the protein are necessary for membrane binding in vitro and in cells (46Stahelin R.V. Hwang J.H. Kim J.H. Park Z.Y. Johnson K.R. Obeid L.M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43030-43038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of Ser225 increases the membrane affinity of hSK1. If a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism accounts for IGF-2/M6P receptor-mediated SK1 activation, the identity of the kinase and its mechanism of action remain to be determined. Another finding of our study is that maximum IGF-2-stimulated ERK1/2 activation is about 30% lower than the maximum IGF-1 response, despite the observation that at high concentrations, IGF-1 and IGF-2 promote equivalent phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptor β-subunit Tyr1158. This difference in efficacy may reflect differences in the pattern of receptor or adapter protein phosphorylation generated by two ligands binding to the same receptor. Analogous results have been reported for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, ErbB1, where binding of EGF and betacellulin generate similar levels of ErbB1 Y1086 phosphorylation, but betacellulin produces greater Akt activation and a more robust anti-apoptotic response than EGF (47Saito T.

Tamura R. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Lee I.-K. Koh G.Y. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the reduced IGF-2 response could result from downstream effects on the ERK1/2 pathway due to concomitant IGF-2 receptor activation by IGF-2 but not IGF-1. Given the complexity of the system and the limitations of our current understanding of IGF-2 receptor signaling, the basis of these differences will have to be addressed in future studies. In purified reconstituted systems, only seven membrane-spanning GPCRs have been shown to possess intrinsic ligand-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for heterotrimeric G proteins. Nonetheless, it is clear that heterotrimeric G proteins mediate a subset of signals initiated by diverse non-heptahelical receptors, including the insulin, IGF-1, EGF, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and single membrane-spanning receptors for C-type natriuretic peptide and zona pellucida glycoprotein, integrins, and T cell receptors (49Patel T.B. Pharm. Rev. 2004; 56: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Apart from our results with the IGF-1 and IGF-2/M6P receptors (31El-Shewy H.M. Johnson K.R. Lee M.-H. Jaffa A.A. Obeid L.M. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31399-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), heterotrimeric G protein activation resulting from SK1-dependent transactivation of S1P receptors has been shown to account for pertussis toxin-sensitive signaling by platelet-derived growth factor receptor (50Hobson J.P.

Based on this small but growing body of evidence, it is tempting to speculate that S1P receptor transactivation represents a common mechanism of signal convergence that permits structurally diverse non-GPCRs to access heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2063094026,"The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for embryonic development and carcinogenesis. Upon Wnt stimulation, β-catenin is stabilized and associates with T-cell factor or lymphoid enhancing factor, thereby activating transcription of target genes. In the absence of Wnt stimulation, the level of β-catenin is reduced via glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. Here, we report the identification of Ajuba as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. Ajuba is a member of LIM domain-containing proteins that contribute to cell fate determination and regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. We found that enforced expression of Ajuba destabilized β-catenin and suppressed target gene expression. Ajuba promoted GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin by reinforcing the association between β-catenin and GSK-3β. Furthermore, Wnt stimulation induced both accumulation of β-catenin and destabilization of Ajuba. Our findings suggest that Ajuba is important for regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2000210208,"The ribosomal acidic P0 protein, an essential component of the eukaryotic ribosomal stalk, was found to interact with the helix-loop-helix protein human Grap2 and cyclin D interacting protein (GCIP)/D-type cyclin-interacting protein 1/human homolog of MAID protein. Using in vivo and in vitro binding assays, we show that P0 can interact with the N and C termini of GCIP via its N-terminal 39-114 amino-acid residues. Although the P0-GCIP complex was detected mainly in cytoplasmic fraction, polysome profile analysis indicated that the P0-GCIP complex did not coelute with either polysomes or 60S ribosomes, suggesting that GCIP associates with the free form of P0 in the cytoplasm. Transfection of GCIP into MCF-7 cells resulted in decreased levels of pRb phosphorylation. Cotransfection of P0 with GCIP, however, resulted in GCIP-mediated reduction of pRb phosphorylation level which was repressed by P0. Furthermore, overexpression of P0 in breast cancer and hepatocellular cancer cell lines promoted cell growth and colony formation compared to control transfectants. Overexpression of P0 also increased cyclin D1 expression and phosphorylation of pRb at Ser780. Interestingly, P0 mRNA was overexpressed in 12 of 20 pairs of breast cancer/ normal breast specimens (60%). Together, these data indicate that P0 overexpression may cause tumorigenesis in breast and liver tissues at least in part by inhibiting GCIP-mediated tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2119260058,"Multiple myeloma (MM), a progressive hematological neoplasm, is thought to result from multiple genetic events affecting the terminal plasma cell. However, genetic aberrations related to MM are seldom reported. Using our in-house array-based comparative genomic hybridization system to locate candidate target genes with following their expression analysis, we identified POU2AF1 at 11q23.1 as a probable amplification target in MM cell lines. POU2AF1 is a B-cell-specific transcriptional co-activator, which interacts with octamer-binding transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2, and augments their function. Downregulation of POU2AF1 expression by specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited MM cell growth, whereas ectopic expression of POU2AF1 promoted growth of MM cells. Among putative transcriptional targets for POU2AF1, B-cell maturation factor, TNFRSF17, enhanced its transcription by POU2AF1, and POU2AF1 directly bound to an octamer site within the 5′ region of TNFRSF17. Expression level of TNFRSF17 was closely correlated with that of POU2AF1 in cell lines and primary samples of MM, and decreasing TNFRSF17 expression by means of TNFRSF17 siRNA inhibited MM cell growth. Taken together, our results suggest that POU2AF1, when activated by amplification or other mechanisms, may contribute to progression of MM by accelerating growth of MM cells through direct transactivation of one of its target genes, TNFRSF17."

Our previous studies have established Cbl as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitinylation and degradation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α and PDGFRβ. However, the role of endogenous Cbl in PDGFR regulation and the molecular mechanisms of this regulation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous Cbl is essential for ligand-induced ubiquitinylation and degradation of PDGFRβ; this involves the Cbl TKB domain binding to PDGFRβ phosphotyrosine 1021, a known phospholipase C (PLC) γ1 SH2 domain-binding site. Lack of Cbl or ablation of the Cbl-binding site on PDGFRβ impedes receptor sorting to the lysosome. Cbl-deficient cells also show more PDGF-induced PLCγ1 association with PDGFRβ and enhanced PLC-mediated cell migration. Thus, Cbl-dependent negative regulation of PDGFRβ involves a dual mechanism that concurrently promotes ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal sorting of the receptor and competitively reduces the recruitment of a positive mediator of receptor signaling.

However, the functional role of endogenous Cbl proteins has not been addressed, and the mechanisms underlying the Cbl-PDGFR interaction remain unidentified. Several previous findings suggest that Cbl may interact with PDGFRs through its TKB domain because a point mutation (G306E) within the TKB domain that abolishes the binding of Cbl to its phospho-peptide targets reduces Cbl-PDGFR association (18Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher M.L. Langdon Jr., W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An intact TKB domain was also required for Cbl protein to promote the ubiquitinylation of PDGFR as well as for negative regulation of PDGFR-mediated cell proliferation and survival (20Miyake S.

Thus, identification of Cbl TKB domain-binding motif(s) on PDGFR is crucial to elucidate the mechanism of Cbl-mediated PDGFR regulation.PLCs play a crucial role downstream of RTKs by catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which in turn mediate intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C activation, respectively (35Rhee S.G.

Notably, the PLCγ1-docking site tyrosine (Tyr1021) is crucial for PDFGRβ-regulated chemotactic rather than mitogenic response of cells to PDGF BB stimulation (43Valius M. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A.

We provide evidence that endogenous Cbl is not only an important determinant of targeting activated PDGFRβ for ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal degradation, but a negative regulator of PLCγ1-mediated chemotactic and migratory responses to PDGF. These findings reveal a novel dual mode of Cbl-mediated negative regulation of PDGFR via 1) ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the receptor and 2) competitive RTK binding with the positive signaling mediator PLCγ1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The sources of reagents were as follows: PDGF AA and BB were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

GFP coding sequences were cloned into destination vector pcDNA-DEST47 and pcDNA-PDGFRβ-GFP chimera generated by recombineering according to the manufacturer's protocols. The chimeric sequences from this construct were PCR-amplified (primers 1 and 3 in supplemental Table S1) and Topo-cloned back into pENTR/SD/D-TOPO followed by LR Clonase recombination into lentiviral destination vector pLenti6-V5-DEST. Point mutants were generated using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (primers listed in supplemental Table S1). All of the constructs were sequence-verified. The PDGFRβ-GFP chimera and its mutants (Y1009F, Y1021F, Y0009F/Y1021F, Y716F, Y716F/Y1009F, Y716F/Y1021F, and Y716F/Y1009F/Y1021F) were packaged and used to infect MCF-7 cells according to the vendor instructions (ViraPower lentiviral expression system; Invitrogen). Blasticidin-resistant (Invitrogen) (2 μg/ml) cells were analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorter (GFP) and anti-PDGFRβ immunoblotting.shRNA-mediated Cbl Knock-down—Three Cbl-specific shRNAs (supplemental Table S2) were designed using the S-fold software (sfold.wadsworth.org) and cloned into the pSUPERIOR-Retro vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). The shRNAs were introduced into MCF-7 cells using retroviral infection (24Duan L. Miura Y. Dimri M. Majumder B. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Ghosh A. Fernandes N. Zhou P. Mullane-Robinson K. Rao N.

Puromycin-resistant (0.5 μg/ml) cells were analyzed for Cbl protein levels using Western blotting.Wound Healing and Transwell Migration Assays—Serum-starved confluent cell monolayers were scratched with a plastic pipette tip and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The plates were refed with starvation medium with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB and allowed to heal at 37 °C. The cells were photographed at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h with an inverted phase contrast microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TE2000-U) equipped with a CCD camera. For Boyden chamber Transwell migration assays, 105 cells in 400 μl of serum-free medium were added to the upper chamber coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml), and the cells were allowed to adhere for 4 h. Subsequently, 400 μl of starvation medium containing various stimulants was added to the lower chamber, and cell migration was allowed for 4 h. The cells on the upper surface were removed with a cotton swab, and the migrated cells on the lower surface were fixed and stained using the Diff-Quick® stain kit (Dade Behring Inc., Newark, DE) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Each data point is a mean of six replicates, with average of three high power (400×) fields/filter. Statistical analysis used the Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered significant. The experiments were repeated at least three times.Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Immunoblotting (IB)—IPs and IBs were carried as described previously (18Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher M.L. Langdon Jr., W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).GST Fusion Protein Pulldown Assays—MCF-7 cells expressing PDGFRβ-GFP or its mutants were serum-starved and stimulated with PDGF BB (20 ng/ml) for 10 min prior to lysis. GST fusion protein pulldowns from 1-mg aliquots of lysate protein and 20 μg of GST or GST-Cbl (Cbl-N, amino acids 1-357; and Cbl-N/G306E) fusion proteins were carried out as described (29Lupher M.L.

The sequence-verified construct was used for expression and purification of the GST fusion protein as described (29Lupher M.L. Songyang Jr., Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The GST tag was cleaved from fusion proteins using the PreScission protease, according to the manufacturer's protocols (GE Healthcare). For Cbl-N/Cbl-N-G306E proteins, the GST tag was cleaved with human thrombin; contaminating thrombin was removed by incubating proteins with p-aminobenzamidine beads (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cleaved proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline prior to binding assays.For competitive binding assays, various concentrations of isolated PLCγ1SH2 domain protein were added to lysates of nonstimulated or PDGF BB-stimulated MEFs for 45 min at 4 °C followed by pulldown using 20 μg of GST or GST-Cbl-N (or Cbl-N/G306E) fusion proteins as above.Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The cells were seeded on sterilized coverslips in regular growth medium for 24 h, serum-starved for 48 h, and stimulated with PDGF-BB as described above. The cells were fixed in 3.8% paraformaldehyde and immunostained as described (24Duan L. Miura Y. Dimri M. Majumder B. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Ghosh A. Fernandes N. Zhou P. Mullane-Robinson K. Rao N.

Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for visualizing the nuclei (Vector Laboratories). The images were acquired with a Nikon C1 confocal microscope system under 600× magnification.RESULTSEndogenous Cbl Is Required for Efficient Ligand-induced Ubiquitinylation and Degradation of PDGFRβ—To address the role of endogenous Cbl in PDGFR regulation, we first assessed the extent of ligand-induced PDGFRβ ubiquitinylation in Cbl+/+ and Cbl-/- MEF cell lines. Ligand-dependent ubiquitinylation of PDGFRβ was detected in both of the independently derived Cbl+/+ MEF lines (HG and DB; Fig. 1, A and B); however, the extent of ligand-induced PDGFRβ ubiquitinylation was greatly reduced in both Cbl-/- MEFs (HG and DB), indicating that endogenous Cbl is the major E3 mediating PDGFRβ ubiquitinylation in MEFs. Anti-PDGFRβ IP followed by anti-PDGFRβ IB (Fig. 1, A and B) revealed that ligand-induced loss of the PDGFRβ protein was substantially slower in both Cbl-/- MEFs; concomitantly, we observed a slower and less pronounced decrease in tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFRβ (Fig. 1, A and B). The pattern of PDGFRβ phosphorylation indicated that impaired PDGFRβ ubiquitinylation in Cbl-/- cells was not due to defective PDGFRβ activation.FIGURE 1Impaired ligand-induced PDGFRβ ubiquitinylation and degradation in MEFs lacking endogenous Cbl expression. A and B, the HG (A) or DB (B) Cbl+/+ and Cbl-/- MEF lines were serum-starved and stimulated with PDGF BB (20 ng/ml) for the indicated time points (in min) prior to lysis. Anti-PDGFRβ IPs from 1-mg aliquots of lysate protein were subjected to serial IB with anti-PDGFRβ (top panel), anti-ubiquitin (middle panel), and anti-Tyr(P) (bottom panel) antibodies. The relative PDGFRβ signals were quantified by densitometry using the Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and are depicted as a proportion of signals observed with unstimulated cell lysates (set as 1). C-E, retro-viral infection was used to express HA-tagged human Cbl (HA-Cbl) or vector alone in Cbl+/+ and Cbl-/- MEFs (HG or DB as indicated). 200-μg aliquots of lysate protein were subjected to anti-Cbl IP followed by anti-Cbl IB. The levels of HA-Cbl protein in reconstituted Cbl-/- (DB and HG) MEFs is comparable with that in Cbl+/+ cells (C). D and E, The vector-transfected or Cbl-reconstituted Cbl-/- MEFs (HG, D; DB, E) were serum-starved and stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF BB for the indicated times prior to cell lysis. 1-mg aliquots of lysate protein were used for anti-PDGFRβ IP followed by serial anti-PDGFRβ (top panel), anti-ubiquitin (middle panel), and anti-Tyr(P) (bottom panel) immunoblotting. Relative PDGFRβ signals were determined by densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To exclude that defective PDGFRβ ubiquitinylation and degradation in Cbl-/- MEFs was not an artifact of cell line derivation, we reconstituted the Cbl expression in both (HG and DB) Cbl-/- MEF lines (Fig. 1C). Comparison of the Cbl-/-/HA-Cbl versus Cbl-/-/vector cells demonstrated that Cbl reconstitution fully restored the PDGF-BB-induced ubiquitinylation and degradation of PDGFRβ (Fig. 1, D and E). Correlating with a higher level of Cbl, PDGF-induced loss of phosphorylated and total PDGFRβ was faster in Cbl+/+/HA-Cbl MEFs versus Cbl+/+/vector MEFs (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, the defect in PDGFRβ ubiquitinylation and degradation in Cbl-/- MEFs is solely due to a lack of Cbl expression. The role of endogenous Cbl in ubiquitinylation and degradation of PDGFRβ was independently verified in MCF-7 cells with stable knock-down of Cbl (supplemental Fig. S5).Identification of the Cbl TKB Domain-binding Site on PDGFRβ—To identify the TKB domain-binding site(s) on PDGFRβ, we used GST fusions of Cbl TKB domain (GST-Cbl-N) or its nonbinding point mutant (GST-Cbl-N-G306E) to pull down wild type (WT) PDGFRβ or its potential Cbl TKB domain-binding site Tyr → Phe mutants ectopically expressed in PDGFRβ-null MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A). The previously described consensus sequence (N/D)XpYXXXϕ (29Lupher M.L. Songyang Jr., Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) suggested the sequence around Tyr1021 in PDGFRβ (NDpYIIPL) as a potential Cbl TKB domain-binding motif (supplemental Fig. S6). We also included a PDGFRβ mutant with a Tyr → Phe mutation in the Grb2 SH2 domain-binding site (Y716F) and the double mutants as controls. Analysis of cell lysates demonstrated that WT and mutant receptors were expressed at comparable levels and underwent similar levels of overall tyrosine phosphorylation upon PDGF BB stimulation (Fig. 2A). The control GST-Grb2 SH2 domain pulled down WT or mutant PDGFRs as long as the Grb2-binding site Tyr716 was intact (Fig. 2B). The GST-Cbl-TKB fusion protein could pull down the PDGF-stimulated WT PDGFRβ, whereas the G306E mutation abolished the TKB interaction with PDGFRβ (Fig. 2C). Importantly, GST-Cbl-TKB failed to pull down the Y1021F mutant but could pull down the PDGFRβ Y716F and Y1009F mutants (Fig. 2C). The inability to pull down Y1021F PDGFRβ indic"
https://openalex.org/W1967342025,"Background Prenatal exposure to cocaine can be deleterious to embryonic brain development, but the results in humans remain controversial, the mechanisms involved are not well understood and effective therapies are yet to be designed. We hypothesize that some of the prenatal effects of cocaine might be related to dysregulation of physiological rhythms due to alterations in the integrating circadian clock function. Methodology and Principle Findings Here we introduce a new high-throughput genetically well-characterized diurnal vertebrate model for studying the mechanisms of prenatal cocaine effects by demonstrating reduced viability and alterations in the pattern of neuronal development following repeated cocaine exposure in zebrafish embryos. This effect is associated with acute cocaine-induced changes in the expression of genes affecting growth (growth hormone, zGH) and neurotransmission (dopamine transporter, zDAT). Analysis of circadian gene expression, using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QPCR), demonstrates that cocaine acutely and dose-dependently changes the expression of the circadian genes (zPer-3, zBmal-1) and genes encoding melatonin receptors (zMelR) that mediate the circadian message to the entire organism. Moreover, the effects of prenatal cocaine depend on the time of treatment, being more robust during the day, independent of whether the embryos are raised under the light-dark cycle or in constant light. The latter suggests involvement of the inherited circadian factors. The principal circadian hormone, melatonin, counteracts the effects of cocaine on neuronal development and gene expression, acting via specific melatonin receptors. Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrate that, in a diurnal vertebrate, prenatal cocaine can acutely dysregulate the expression of circadian genes and those affecting melatonin signaling, growth and neurotransmission, while repeated cocaine exposure can alter neuronal development. Daily variation in these effects of cocaine and their attenuation by melatonin suggest a potential prophylactic or therapeutic role for circadian factors in prenatal cocaine exposure."

https://openalex.org/W1979925305,"The human leukocyte adhesion-G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-TM7 proteins, are shown here to function as homo- and hetero-oligomers. Using cell surface cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of EMR2, an EGF-TM7 receptor predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, we demonstrate that it forms dimers in a reaction mediated exclusively by the TM7 moiety. We have also identified a naturally occurring but structurally unstable EMR2 splice variant that acts as a dominant negative modulator by dimerizing with the wild type receptor and down-regulating its expression. Additionally, heterodimerization between closely related EGF-TM7 members is shown to result in the modulation of expression and ligand binding properties of the receptors. These findings suggest that receptor homo- and hetero-oligomerization play a regulatory role in modulating the expression and function of leukocyte adhesion-GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2029284789,"In the hematopoietic cell system, the oncoprotein Ski dramatically affects growth and differentiation programs, in some cases leading to malignant leukemia. However, little is known about the interaction partners or signaling pathways involved in the Ski-mediated block of differentiation in hematopoietic cells. Here we show that Ski interacts with PU.1, a lineage-specific transcription factor essential for terminal myeloid differentiation, and thereby represses PU.1-dependent transcriptional activation. Consistent with this, Ski inhibits the biological function of PU.1 to promote myeloid cells to differentiate into macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR)-positive macrophages. Using a Ski mutant deficient in PU.1 binding, we demonstrate that Ski–PU.1 interaction is critical for Ski's ability to repress PU.1-dependent transcription and block macrophage differentiation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Ski-mediated repression of PU.1 is due to Ski's ability to recruit histone deacetylase 3 to PU.1 bound to DNA. Since inactivation of PU.1 is closely related to the development of myeloid leukemia and Ski strongly inhibits PU.1 function, we propose that aberrant Ski expression in certain types of myeloid cell lineages might contribute to leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2062039569,"Plasma membrane targeting of G protein α (Gα) subunits is essential for competent receptor-to-G protein signaling. Many Gα are tethered to the plasma membrane by covalent lipid modifications at their N terminus. Additionally, it is hypothesized that Gq family members (Gqα,G11α,G14α, and G16α) in particular utilize a polybasic sequence of amino acids in their N terminus to promote membrane attachment and protein palmitoylation. However, this hypothesis has not been tested, and nothing is known about other mechanisms that control subcellular localization and signaling properties of G14α and G16α. Here we report critical biochemical factors that mediate membrane attachment and signaling function of G14α and G16α. We find that G14α and G16α are palmitoylated at distinct polycysteine sequences in their N termini and that the polycysteine sequence along with the adjacent polybasic region are both important for G16α-mediated signaling at the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, the isolated N termini of G14α and G16α expressed as peptides fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein each exhibit differential requirements for palmitoylation and membrane targeting; individual cysteine residues, but not the polybasic regions, determine lipid modification and subcellular localization. However, full-length G16α, more so than G14α, displays a functional dependence on single cysteines for membrane localization and activity, and its full signaling potential depends on the integrity of the polybasic sequence. Together, these findings indicate that G14α and G16α are palmitoylated at distinct polycysteine sequences, and that the adjacent polybasic domain is not required for Gα palmitoylation but is important for localization and functional activity of heterotrimeric G proteins.

Nothing is known about the lipidation states of G14α and G16α or of other biochemical mechanisms that may regulate G14α and G16α plasma membrane localization and signaling function. Within the region of the N-terminal α-helix, the sequences of G14α and G16α are notably different from Gqα and G11α (Fig. 1A). Although Gqα and G11α are 83% identical in their first 40 amino acids, G14α and G16α share only 65 and 35% identity, respectively, with Gqα across the same region. Furthermore, G14α and G16α are unique among Gα subunits in that they each have three cysteine residues in their N-terminal domain that are putative sites for palmitoylation. Consequently, the N termini of G14α and G16α may be differentially involved in the biochemical regulation of membrane localization and signaling function of these particular Gα proteins. Current evidence supports a dual requirement for Gα palmitoylation and heterotrimer formation to drive plasma membrane localization of Gqα and G11α (11Kosloff M. Elia N. Joel-Almagor T. Timberg R.

Recent models also suggest that Gq family members in particular may utilize multiple positively charged basic residues in the Gα N terminus as a third signal for membrane targeting and attachment. Three-dimensional molecular modeling of Gqα,G11α, G14α, and G16α predicts a cluster of basic amino acids in the N terminus of each Gα to fold in such a way so as to form a positively charged patch on the protein surface (22Kosloff M. Elia N. Selinger Z. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14518-14523Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These residues are expected to align on one face of the Gα N-terminal α-helix in a position favorable for ionic interactions with anionic phospholipids in the plasma membrane. It also has been postulated that this polybasic region is a necessary signal for Gα palmitoylation (22Kosloff M. Elia N. Selinger Z. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14518-14523Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation occurs at cellular membranes, and palmitoyltransferase activity appears to be enriched in the plasma membrane specifically (17Smotrys J.E. Linder M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 559-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 23Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, Gα localization at the plasma membrane mediated by the electrostatic potential of the polybasic region may be a prerequisite for protein palmitoylation. These ideas, however, have never been tested experimentally. In this study, we identify critical Gα-specific N-terminal amino acids and biochemical factors that mediate membrane localization and signaling function of G14α and G16α. We show that G14α and G16α are palmitoylated at distinct polycysteine sequences in their N termini and that the G proteins utilize these sequences for plasma membrane association and effector activation. Furthermore, G16α exhibits a functional dependence on the N-terminal polybasic domain in addition to the polycysteine sequence to maintain membrane localization and biological activity. With a comprehensive comparison of these properties in the isolated Gα N termini and in the full-length heterotrimeric G proteins, we report the unexpected finding that the full-length Gα proteins exhibit differential dependence on the polycysteine and polybasic sequences for localization and function than do the N termini when expressed alone as EGFP fusion proteins. Importantly, we show for the first time that the polybasic domain itself is not involved in palmitoylation of a proximal substrate like the adjacent polycysteine sequences in the Gα N terminus, but instead plays a key role in localization and function of the whole heterotrimeric G protein. Plasmids and Materials—Human G14α and G16α cDNA expression plasmids with internal Glu-Glu (EE) epitope tags (G14α, G14α-Q205L (G14α-Q/L), G16α, and G16α-Q212L (G16α-Q/L)) were purchased from University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center, as were the Gβ1 and Gγ2 expression plasmids. pCDNA3.1 was from Invitrogen, and pEGFP-N1 was from Clontech. KpnI, AgeI, NotI, and SacII restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Primers were synthesized by Sigma Genosys and Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene. HEK 293 and HeLa cells were from ATCC. Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate both were from Sigma. BD Living Colors™ Full-Length A.v. polyclonal antibody (anti-GFP) was from Clontech, and Glu-Glu monoclonal antibody (anti-EE) was from Covance. B861 (anti-G16α), a polyclonal antibody generated against a peptide fragment of G15/16α and Z811, an anti-Gq/11/14/16α polyclonal antibody, which recognizes each of the Gα subunits of the Gqα family and was generated against a C-terminal peptide sequence shared by Gqα and G11α, were generous gifts from Dr. Paul Sternweis (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). Protein A-Sepharose® 4 Fast Flow was from GE Healthcare. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antisera was purchased from Rockland, Inc., and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit was from Bio-Rad. [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid (31 Ci/mmol) and En3Hance™ autoradiography enhancer were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and myo-[2-3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. cDNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—PCR amplification was used to isolate the N-terminal domains of G14α and G16α from the full-length Gα plasmids. Specifically, primers were designed to amplify cDNA sequences G14α-(1–102) and G16α-(1–123). Gα-specific oligomers included an N-terminal KpnI restriction site (sense oligomers) or an AgeI C-terminal site (antisense oligomers). For amplifying the N terminus of G14α (NTG14α), the primers were as follows: 5′-AAGGTACCGCCACCATGGCCGGCTGCTG, CTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGACCGGTCCACGGCGCGCGTCCTTCTTG-3′ (antisense). For amplifying the N terminus of G16α (NTG16α), the primers were as follows: 5′-AAGGTACCGCCACCATGGCCCGCTCGCTGACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGACCGGTCCCCCGCGGTCCTGCTTCTTC-3′ (antisense). The amplified Gα sequences were digested with KpnI and AgeI restriction enzymes and subcloned into pEGFP-N1 upstream and in-frame with the EGFP coding region. A FLAG epitope tag was added to the 3′ end of the NTGα-EGFP coding region by PCR amplification of a KpnI-NotI fragment that included the FLAG sequence. An antisense primer was designed to eliminate the stop codon of the EGFP sequence and introduce the FLAG sequence with a new 3′ stop codon. The antisense primer was 5′-ATCGATCGATGCGGCCGCTTTACTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′ and was used in combination with either the NTG14α or NTG16α sense primer listed previously to generate a KpnI-NotI fragment from the existing NTGα-EGFP sequence for subcloning into pEGFP-N1. To introduce site-specific mutations into the NTGα-EGFP-FLAG and full-length Gα-EE constructs, the QuikChange mutagenesis kit was used according to the manufacturer's suggestions. The R/Q and K/Q mutations in the NTG14α-9Q and NTG16α-5Q constructs were generated by multiple rounds of site-directed mutagenesis with different primer sets. The specific mutations were introduced in the following order for NTG14α-EGFP-FLAG: 3Q (R23Q, K29Q,K30Q), 5Q (3Q plus K12Q, R16Q), 7Q (5Q plus R26Q,R27Q), and 9Q (7Q plus R33Q,R34Q). The specific mutations were introduced in the following order for NTG16α-EGFP-FLAG: 2Q (K36Q,K37Q), 3Q (2Q plus R30Q), 5Q (3Q plus K19Q, R23Q). The NTG16α-5Q sequence was substituted into G16α and G16α-Q212L using PCR amplification and subcloning techniques. G16α-(1–123) was cut from G16α and G16α-Q212L at sites KpnI and SacII. The same region was amplified from NTG16α-5Q using the NTG16α sense primer listed previously and the following antisense primer: 5′-GATGCCCGCGGTCCTGCTGCTGCTGCTCCAAG-3′. The amplified fragment was subcloned into the open G16α plasmids at sites KpnI and SacII. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK 293 cells and HeLa cells were cultured in complete medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; CellGro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and penicillin/streptomycin (CellGro). For transient transfections, Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent was used according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Transfections were carried out for 5 h at 37°C, followed by an overnight incubation in complete medium. Experiments were conducted 24 h after transfection. Fractionation and Serial Extraction—Cells were transiently transfected at a density of 7.125 × 106 cells/plate in 10-cm2 plates with 24 μg of DNA/plate. The following day, cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with a Teflon Dounce homogenizer (50 strokes), and broken cells were normalized to isotonic conditions (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted at 600 × g, 4 °C for 10 min, and the remaining lysate was fractionated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min. A sample of supernatant was collected and saved for immunoblot analysis of the cytosol fraction. The membrane pellet was resuspended in Low Salt Buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), Dounce-homogenized as before, and ultracentrifuged again. This process was repeated a third time to remove nonspecific proteins in the membrane fraction, and a sample of the washed membrane fraction was collected. Membrane and cytosol samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Corp.), and immunoblotted with antibodies for visualization. Serial extraction of harvested membranes was performed as described previously with modifications (24Rose J.J. Taylor J.B. Shi J. Cockett M.I. Jones P.G. Hepler J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2103-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Hollinger S. Taylor J.B. Goldman E.H. Hepler J.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In brief, membranes were prepared from transfected cells by fractionation as described. Following the initial ultracentrifugation of cell lysates, membranes were washed three times in Low Salt Buffer, followed by three washes in buffer supplemented with 1 m NaCl (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and three final washes in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for a total of nine washes. Each wash was carried out at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation for 30 min, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. After each spin, the membrane pellet was resuspended in the appropriate buffer and Dounce-homogenized (50 strokes). Equivalent sample volumes were collected from indicated wash supernatants and membrane pellets. Samples were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. To assist the reader in interpretation of the data, Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems) was used to duplicate bands representing the pelleted membrane fraction from each wash series (“P” bands) and display in adjacent lanes as total material for the next wash series (“T” bands), as both represent the same pool of protein. Immunoblot Analysis—Nitrocellulose membranes were treated as described previously (26Bernstein L.S. Ramineni S. Hague C. Cladman W. Chidiac P. Levey A.I. Hepler J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21248-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, membranes were incubated in a primary antibody dilution for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The following dilutions were used for primary antibodies: anti-GFP 1:1,000, anti-EE 1:2,000, Z811 1:2000, and anti-G16α 1:10,000 in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5% milk, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.02% sodium azide), and anti-FLAG 1:2,000 in Trisbuffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were washed three times with TBST and then probed with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera for 1 h at room temperature. The following dilutions were used for secondary antibodies: goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:30,000 in TBST and goat anti-mouse IgG 1:20,000 in TBST. The protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence and exposed to film. Where indicated, protein expression levels were quantified by densitometry analysis using Scion Image freeware software. Briefly, protein bands were selected within identical rectangles, and the integrated density was calculated for each selection. Background density measured in an identical rectangle on a section of film separate from the protein band of interest was subtracted from each measurement. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were transfected at a density of 7.125 × 106 cells/plate in 10-cm2 plates with a total of 24 μg of DNA/plate. For experiments with the NTGα-EGFP-FLAG fusion proteins, 24 μg of the fusion protein of interest was transfected per plate. For experiments with full-length Gα, cells were transfected with 16.8 μg of EE-tagged Gα ± C/S, 4.8 μg of Gβ1, and 2.4 μg of Gγ2. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were labeled and immunoprecipitated according to a method described in detail elsewhere with minor modifications (27Linder M.E. Kleuss C. Mumby S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 314-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Bernstein L.S. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Smrcka A.V. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 195-204Google Scholar). Specifically, cells for autoradiography were metabolically labeled with 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid for 2 h at 37°Cin palmitate labeling media (DMEM, 2.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1× sodium pyruvate, and 1× non-essential amino acids (CellGro)). Because G14α has been recalcitrant to metabolic labeling with [3H]palmitate in these studies for unknown reasons, three 10-cm2 plates of G14α ± C/S-expressing cells were used for each labeling experiment and each immunoblotting experiment, whereas one 10-cm2 plate of transfected cells was used for each of the other experiments. All cells were lysed and fractionated as described. Cytosol fractions were saved for immunoprecipitation. For NTGα-EGFP-FLAG-expressing cells, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of Low Salt Buffer and Dounce-homogenized as before (50 strokes). The broken membranes were diluted with an additional 1.5 ml of Low Salt Buffer to wash away nonspecific proteins in the membrane fraction, and ultracentrifugation was repeated. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of Tris Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and Dounce-homogenized as before. n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DβM; Calbiochem) was added to a final concentration of 2%. Membrane proteins were extracted with 2% DβM for 3 h, rotating end-over-end at 4 °C, and debris was pelleted by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). Membrane extracts and cytosol were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, rotating end-over-end. The following day, the anti-FLAG resin was pelleted and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). The resin then was resuspended in 2× Laemmli Sample Buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% bromphenol blue). For Gα ± C/S-expressing cells, membrane pellets were immediately resuspended in Tris Buffer without an additional wash step, and DβM was added to both membrane and cytosol fractions to a final concentration of 2%. G14α ± C/S and G16α ± C/S were extracted from membranes and cytosol with a 3-h incubation in 2% DβM at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Cell debris was pelleted by ultracentrifugation (75,000 rpm, 4 °C, 30 min). Prior to immunoprecipitation, soluble extracts were blocked for 2 h with 0.7 μg/μl bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Anti-EE monoclonal antibody was diluted 1:150 in each membrane and cytosol sample for overnight immunoprecipitation of EE-tagged G14α and G16α proteins at 4 °C. The following day, Sepharose beads were pelleted at 200 × g, 4 °C for 1 min. Beads were washed three times with Tris Buffer + 0.01% DβM, then resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. All samples were heated to 95 °C for 1 min and spun down at 14,000 rpm, and the entire supernatants were loaded onto 11% polyacrylamide gels (Gα ± C/S samples) or 15% polyacrylamide gels (NTGα-EGFP-FLAG samples) for SDS-PAGE separation. Samples for immunoblot analysis were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western transfer, and immunoblotting was carried out as described. Gels for autoradiography were prepared according to a method described previously (28Bernstein L.S. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Smrcka A.V. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 195-204Google Scholar). Fixed proteins were treated with En3Hance™ solution for autoradiography amplification according to manufacturer's instructions and were exposed to film at –80 °C for indicated times. Hydroxylamine treatment and [35S]methionine labeling were carried out as described previously (28Bernstein L.S. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Smrcka A.V. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 195-204Google Scholar). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells at a density of 1.75 × 105 cells/well were transfected directly on sterile coverslips in 24-well plates with 0.8 μg of DNA/well. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were fixed using an adaptation of methods described previously (29Shu F-J. Ramineni S. Amyot W. Hepler J.R. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed one time in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in fixation buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm glutaraldehyde, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3.7% paraformaldehyde) for 15 min at room temperature.

This approach identified Hsp90 and Bag1-L as novel GrB substrates, and an additional GrB cleavage site was identified in the Hsc70/Hsp70-Interacting Protein, Hip. Hsp90, Bag1L, and Hip were validated as GrB substrates in vitro, and mutational analysis confirmed the additional cleavage site in Hip. Because the role of Hip in apoptosis is unknown, its proteolysis by GrB was used as a basis to test whether it has anti-apoptotic activity. Previous work on Hip was limited to in vitro characterization; therefore, it was important to demonstrate Hip cleavage in a physiological context and to show its relevance to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated death. Hip is cleaved at both GrB cleavage sites during NK-mediated cell death in a caspase-independent manner, and its cleavage is due solely to GrB and not other granule components. Furthermore, Hip is not cleaved upon stimulation of the Fas receptor in the Jurkat T-cell line, suggesting that Hip is a substrate unique to GrB. RNA interference-mediated reduction of Hip within the K562 cell line rendered the cells more susceptible to NK cell-mediated lysis, indicating that proteolysis by GrB of Hip contributes to death induction. The small effect of RNA interference-mediated Hip deficiency on cytotoxicity is in agreement with the inherent redundancy of NK cell-mediated cell death.

During granule exocytosis, the granzymes, a family of serine proteases, are released into the cytoplasm of the target cells with the assistance of perforin, where they induce target cell death. The human granzyme family includes five members that are termed A, B, H, K, and M. Granzymes A and B are the most well characterized and have been implicated as important contributors to target cell death (2Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J.

We undertook a candidate-based approach to identify new GrB substrates. The extended substrate specificity of GrB has been comprehensively identified by the use of positional scanning substrate combinatorial libraries (16Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P.

These data sets provide a four-amino acid “zip code” to identify potential cleavage sites within a protein. Algorithms such as PoPS (18Boyd S.E. Pike R.N. Rudy G.B. Whisstock J.C. J.

However, searching the entire proteome for substrates with only the zip code yields too many hits to practically screen. Additional information is required to filter the hits to a reasonable number. Proteomic screens (8Bredemeyer A.J. Lewis R.M. Malone J.P. Davis A.E. Gross J. Townsend R.R. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here, we restricted our search for GrB substrates to the heat shock/stress response family because of the well documented interplay between stress response and cell death (21Parcellier A. Gurbuxani S. Schmitt E. Solary E. Garrido C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 22Beere H.M. J.

Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are a family of ubiquitous and highly conserved chaperone proteins that serve a maintenance function in the cell, helping to fold newly synthesized peptides. They are also expressed in response to environmental, physical, and chemical stress, including heat shock, oxidative free radicals, chemotherapeutic agents, nutrient withdrawal, and irradiation (21Parcellier A. Gurbuxani S. Schmitt E. Solary E. Garrido C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 22Beere H.M. J.

Hsps are able to prevent protein aggregation and stimulate the refolding and renaturation of proteins that have misfolded under stress. These functions limit the extent of stress-induced damage and facilitate cellular recovery. Conversely, apoptosis removes damaged or unwanted cells. Both of these opposing mechanisms are so well conserved that it is likely the two evolved together. It is not surprising, then, that components of these two pathways are increasingly found to oppose each other at the molecular level. Indeed, many Hsps have been shown to directly interfere with components of the apoptotic machinery, and this inhibition is sometimes, but not always, dependent on chaperone activity (21Parcellier A. Gurbuxani S. Schmitt E. Solary E. Garrido C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 23Beere H.M. J. Clin.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Therefore, Hsps respond to stress by preventing the misfolding and aggregation of proteins while directly antagonizing the apoptotic machinery to tip the balance toward cell survival. Given the antagonistic interactions between the stress response/heat shock pathway and apoptosis, GrB may also target Hsps to ensure the death of the target cell. This hypothesis is supported by the identification of Hsp70, Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop), and Hsc70/Hsp70-interacting protein (Hip) as GrB substrates (8Bredemeyer A.J. Lewis R.M. Malone J.P. Davis A.E. Gross J. Townsend R.R. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11785-11790Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Loeb C.R. Harris J.L. Craik C.S. J. Biol.

To identify additional stress response substrates of GrB, members of the chaperone family of proteins were chosen as candidates for a sequence-based search for GrB cleavage sites. Three putative GrB substrates were identified. Hsp90, the Bcl-2-associated athano gene-1 (Bag1), and Hip were found to be substrates of GrB in vitro, and an additional cleavage site was identified and validated in Hip. Prior to this work, Hsp90 and Bag1 were known chaperone family members with documented anti-apoptotic roles, but Hip was not known to play an anti-apoptotic role and was therefore selected for further investigation. Proteolysis of Hip at both cleavage sites was caspase-independent and GrB-dependent in cell based assays. GrB cleavage is predicted to result in a loss of function by compromising the oligomerization domain of Hip and its Hsc70/Hsp70-interacting domain. To determine whether Hip loss of function made a contribution to natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, RNA interference was used to reduce cellular levels of Hip within the K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line. Hip deficiency rendered the cells slightly more susceptible to natural killer cell-mediated lysis, indicating that the proteolysis of Hip by GrB contributes to death induction. The modest impact of Hip deficiency is consistent with previous work showing that no single substrate or mechanism is required for GrB-mediated death and demonstrates the highly redundant nature of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Reagents-The caspase inhibitor z-DEVD-FMK was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (catalog number ALX-260-072-M001) and Calbiochem (catalog number 264155). The caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK was purchased from EMD Biosciences (catalog number 627610) and Bachem (catalog number N-1560). When present, both caspase inhibitors were used in equimolar amounts (50 μm each) and are designated as CI. Antibodies to PARP were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number sc-7150) or from Cell Signaling Technologies (catalog number 9542). The antibody to the p48 Hsc/Hsp70-Interacting Protein, Hip, was from Affinity BioReagents (catalog number MA3–413). The anti-Bag1 antibody was from Stressgen (catalog number AAM-400). The anti-Hsp90 antibody (recognizing both α and β isoforms) was from Cell Signaling (catalog number 4874). Both the α-specific (catalog number SPS-771) and β-specific (catalog number SPA-843) anti-hsp90 antibodies were from Stressgen. The antibody to c-Myc was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number sc-40). Human GrB was a generous gift from either Dr. Nancy Thornberry (Merck) or Dr. Sandra Waugh Ruggles (Catalyst Biosciences.) The small molecule GrB inhibitor l-038597 (GI) was developed as described in Ref. 25Willoughby C.A. Bull H.G. Garcia-Calvo M. Jiang J. Chapman K.T. Thornberry N.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 2197-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and was a generous gift from Dr. Nancy Thornberry (Merck). Purified recombinant Hip (catalog number SPP-767), Hsp90 (catalog number SPP-770), and Hsp27 (catalog number SPP-715) proteins were from Stressgen. Cell Lines and Culture-All of the cell lines are available from the American Type Culture Collection. K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia and Jurkat T-cell leukemia cell lines were all propagated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. NK-92 human natural killer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mm glutamax-1 (Invitrogen; catalog number 35050-81), nonessential amino acids (l-Ala, l-Asn, l-Asp, l-Glu, Gly, l-Pro, and l-Ser), 110 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml interleukin-2. All of the cells and transfectants were maintained in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Plasmid Construction-All of the inserts were ligated into the Invitrogen mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 Myc/His6 that contains a neomycin resistance gene. Each overexpressed protein, therefore, was C-terminally Myc and His6-tagged. Human Hip was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from mRNA prepared from K562 cells by using the RNeasy Mini Kit and Omniscript reverse transcriptase (both from Qiagen), Pfx DNA polymerase, and the primers 5′-GCC GAA TTC CGC TTG ACC TCC-3′ (reverse) and 5′-CAC AAG CTT ATG GAC CCC CGC AAA GTG-3′ (forward). The reverse transcription-PCR product was cloned into a Invitrogen TOPO TA cloning kit as an intermediate step for blue/white screening and then sequenced. Positive clones were then excised by HindIII and EcoRI digestion and ligated into the pcDNA 3.1 Myc/His6 vector for mammalian expression. The uncleavable mutant Hip-DDNN was cloned using a Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit first by synthesizing and confirming the D92N single mutant and then subjecting this clone to a second round to make the D180N mutation. The mutagenesis primers used were the following: 5′-GAA GGT GTG ATT GAA CCA AAC ACT GAT GCT CCT CAA GA-3′ (D92N), the complement of primer D92N, 5′-GCC ATT GAA ATA AAT CCG AAT TCA GCT CAG CCT TAC AAG TGG-3′ (D180N), and the complement of primer D180N. Proteolysis of Chaperones in Vitro-Purified Hip, Hsp90, or Hsp27 protein at 45 μg/ml was incubated at 37 °C with 50 nm human GrB in GrB activity buffer containing 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20. Aliquots of 15 μl containing 670 ng of either Hip or Hsp90 were taken at specific intervals and were mixed with sample loading buffer. The samples were loaded onto 4–20% Tris-glycine gels and separated by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. On-line Capillary Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis-A 1-μl aliquot of the digestion mixture was injected manually into an Eldex capillary liquid chromatography system and separated by a silica-based monolithic reverse phase capillary column (Onyx column from Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of ∼1 μl/min. The HPLC eluent was connected directly to the micro-ion electrospray source of a QSTAR Pulsar QqTOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystem/MDS Sciex, Foster City, CA). Typical performance characteristics were >8000 resolution with 30 ppm mass measurement accuracy in mass spectrometry mode. Lysis and Immunoblotting-Cytoplasmic lysates to be treated with GrB were generated by resuspending cells at 1 × 107 cells/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40, (Lysis Buffer). Aliquots from cell killing or Fas stimulation experiments described below were lysed in lysis buffer including the Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture tablet from Roche Applied Science (product number 11 697 498 001) (Lysis Buffer + PI) to stop proteolysis. After incubating on ice for 30 min, the lysates were spun at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble fraction. The protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), and equal amounts of total protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked in Tris-buffered saline Triton X-100 containing 5% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin, as per the antibody manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were then incubated with substrate-specific antibodies, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were developed on film with the ECL (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience) or ECL Plus detection systems (GE Healthcare). The locations of prestained protein markers were traced by overlaying the film onto the membrane. Immunoblots presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. Confirming Proteolysis in Cell Lysates-K562 cytoplasmic extracts were generated in the absence or presence of 50 μm CI in lysis buffer. The lysate was incubated with 50 nm human GrB in the absence or presence of 20 μm GI, and aliquots were removed from 1 to 6 h. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. NK Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity-NK-92 effectors (E) and K562 targets (T) were collected, counted, and mixed at varying E:T ratios as in Refs. 3Mahrus S. Craik C.S. Chem.

For analysis of proteolysis by immunoblotting, killing was stopped at intervals from 1 to 6 h by collecting and lysing the cells in Lysis Buffer + PI. For analysis by flow cytometry, the cells were mixed as described in Ref. 3Mahrus S. Craik C.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 567-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar. Briefly, 20,000 K562 cells were mixed with 20,000–80,000 NK-92 effectors in a total volume of 50 μl of medium in 5 ml, 12 × 75 mm polystyrene round bottom test tubes (BD Biosciences, catalog number 352054). Prior to mixing, the cells were preincubated for at least 1 h in 50 μm CI; CI concentration was kept constant throughout the experiment. The cells were incubated for 1–6 h at 37 °C, and phosphate-buffered saline was added to 475 μl to stop the experiment. The cells were stained with 20 μl of an anti-CD56 allophycocyanin-conjugated antibody (Becton Dickinson; catalog number 555518) and 5 μl of propidium iodide (BioVision, catalog number K101) and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were then transferred to ice, kept in the dark, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dead target cells were counted as the population of PI+, CD56 cells, excluding cellular debris. Analysis was conducted with FlowJo v.6.4.1 software. Activation of Caspase-mediated Apoptosis in Jurkat T-cell Leukemia Cells-Jurkat cells were plated in a 96-well plate at 4 × 105 cells/well in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. The cells were stimulated with 200 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody CH-11 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; product number 05-201) and incubated from 2 to 6 h. At the indicated time intervals, the aliquots were lysed in Lysis Buffer + PI. Stable Transfectant Generation-All of the transfections were executed using an Amaxa electroporator system and the Nucleofector Solution V, program T-16, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For generation of stable cell lines expressing Myc-tagged cleavable Hip and uncleavable Hip-DDNN proteins, 1 million K562 cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were plated in ClonaCell-TCS (Stem Cell Technologies; product number 03814) methylcellulose-based medium containing 1.2–1.7 mg/ml G418 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Colonies were allowed to form for up to 2 weeks and were then selected and expanded in culture medium containing 1.5 mg/ml G418. Clones expressing the constructs were maintained, expanded, weaned off of G418, and periodically checked for expression of the desired Hip protein. siRNA Knock-down of Hip-All of the transfections were generated by using the Amaxa electroporation instrument and solution kits as described above. Of the four siRNA duplexes available from Ambion, siRNA 13835 resulted in optimal Hip knock-down. Hip-deficient cells were compared with either K562 cells transfected with nuclease-free water or the nontargeting siRNA negative control number 4 (Ambion; catalog number 4641). The ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool from Dharmacon (catalog number L-017380-00-0005) was also used to silence Hip expression. Hip-deficient cells were compared with K562 cells transfected with ON-TARGETplus siCONTROL Nontargeting pool (Dharmacon; catalog number D-001810-10-05). On the day of the transfection, 1 million K562 cells were transfected with ∼3 μg of Ambion siRNA or Dharmacon siRNA according to the instructions from Amaxa. Transfected cells were maintained in 12-well plates at a maximum concentration of 500,000 cells/ml for up to 6 days post-transfection. The transfectants were then either used for lysis and immunoblotting or for cell killing experiments, both described above. Statistical Analysis-All of the analyses were performed using the freely available R language (26Team R.D.C. R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. 2005; Google Scholar). To analyze the association of dead cell ratio in K562 cells with siRNA transfection, a multivariate linear model was fit with dead cell ratio as response and siRNA transfection indicator as the independent variable. To control for length of incubation and K562/natural cell ratio, time and K562/natural cell ratio covariates were added. Time was considered as a continuous variable because it had a strong linear association with the response, whereas K562/natural cell ratio was considered as categorical because there was no obvious trend. To take into account the blocking effect of the experiments being performed in pairs for each time point and K562/natural cell ratio, a random blocking effect for each pair was also included. The model was fit using the nlme package in R (27Lindstrom M.L. Bates D.M. Biometrics. 1990; 46: 673-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Several Members of the Chaperone Family Are Proteolyzed by Granzyme B in Vitro-Recently, three chaperone family members have been shown to be GrB substrates: Hsp70 (11Loeb C.R. Harris J.L. Craik C.S.

Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 1877-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Other chaperone proteins were therefore investigated for their ability to be proteolyzed by GrB. As a first pass approach to determining whether a particular chaperone family member could be a prospective GrB substrate, the amino acid sequence was scanned for putative GrB cleavage sites. GrB has an absolute requirement to cleave C-terminally to aspartic acid residues because of Arg226 in its S1 pocket (28Rotonda J. Garcia-Calvo M. Bull H.G. Geissler W.M. McKeever B.M. Willoughby C.A.

Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

The GrB optimal substrate has the sequence (I/V)EPD (supplemental Table S1). Specificity profiling data indicated that the preference of GrB for Ile or Val at P4 is of critical importance, but that its preference at P3 and P2 is much more broad. The likelihood of a site being cleaved can also be evaluated on the basis of the preference of all proteases to cleave specifically at extended β strands (30Tyndall J.D. Nall T. Fairlie D.P. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 973-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The chaperones selected for cleavage site analysis included those with known and unknown anti-apoptotic roles. Cleavage sites were identified by both sequence gazing and by GraBCas (20Backes C. Kuentzer J. Lenhof H.P. Comtesse N. Meese E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W208Crossref PubMed"

The eight C-type and five N-type calcium-binding repeats of TSP-2 form a circuitous wire that, in 2 mm calcium, interacts at its ends with more N-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules, EGF2 and EGF3, and the C-terminal lectin-like module. These components, along with the other EGF-like module(s), form the signature domain of TSPs. Characterization of conformation-sensitive epitopes of monoclonal antibodies to human TSP-2 and its TSP-1 homolog have given insights into the structure of the signature domain in the absence of calcium. The epitope for 4B6.13 anti-TSP-2 was localized to His-722 and Leu-703 in repeat 1C of the wire; recognition only occurred in constructs that included EGF3, the rest of the wire, and the lectin-like module and in the presence of calcium. The epitope for C6.7 anti-TSP-1 was localized to Glu-609 in the EGF2 module. The C6.7 epitope was preferentially recognized when EGF2 was expressed in the context of EGF1, EGF3, the wire, and the lectin-like module. Preferential recognition of the C6.7 epitope did not require calcium. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy of TSP-1 has shown elongation of the stalk and diminution of the C-terminal globule. We propose a model whereby at low calcium concentrations the lectin-like module drops away from EGF3 concomitant with changes in conformation of the wire and loss of the 4B6.13 epitope.

Thrombospondins (TSP) 2The abbreviations used are:TSPthrombospondinEGFepidermal growth factormAbmonoclonal antibodyhhumanmmurineBSAbovine serum albuminELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayvWFvon Willebrand factor are a family of Ca2+-binding extracellular matrix glycoproteins. The vertebrate TSPs are divided into two groups based on their oligomerization and modular organization. Subgroup A forms trimers and consists of TSP-1 and TSP-2, and subgroup B forms pentamers and consists of TSP-3, TSP-4, and TSP-5/COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) (1Adams J. Lawler J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 188-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 2Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A monomer of TSP from subgroup A contains an N-terminal module (N), an oligomerization domain (o), a vWF-C module (C), three properdin or type 1 modules (P), three epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like or type 2 modules (E), eight C-type and five N-type Ca2+-binding repeats to form the wire module (Ca), and a lectin-like module (G) (Fig. 1A). Subgroup B does not have the vWF-C or properdin modules, and contains four EGF-like modules. The hallmark of the TSP family is the highly conserved signature domain or thrombospondin C-terminal cassette (3Adams J.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1102-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The signature domain is stabilized by Ca2+ and composed of interacting elements. These elements are three or more contiguous EGF-like modules, the Ca2+-binding wire, and the lectin-like module (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F.

This number agrees with the crystal structure, which revealed 26 Ca2+ ions bound to the wire, 3 to the lectin-like module, and 1 to EGF2, for a total of 30 bound Ca2+ ions (4Carlson C.B.

Biophysical analysis on constructs with various parts of the soluble signature domain of TSP-2 (6Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) indicated that the elements of the signature domain interact with each other as in the crystal structure (4Carlson C.B.

Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and thus comprise a complex structural unit that is influenced by the presence or absence of Ca2+. Rotary shadowing EM has shown that the removal of Ca2+ dramatically alters the structure of TSP-1, resulting in a decrease in size of a large, apparently globular, C-terminal structure and an increase in the length of adjacent connecting stalk with no change in the size of the N-terminal globule (7Lawler J.

Similar diminution of the C-terminal globule and elongation of the stalk upon depletion of Ca2+ have been demonstrated for TSP-3, TSP-4, and TSP-5 (for review see Ref. 3Adams J.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1102-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). How the signature domain rearranges to cause the changes seen in rotary shadowing EM is not known. Here we characterize the epitopes of conformation-sensitive mAbs to TSP-1 and TSP-2 and work from this information to derive a model of the signature domains of TSP-1 and TSP-2 in low Ca2+. Monoclonal Antibodies (mAb)—The murine mAb 4B6.13 was found in a panel of mAbs raised against overlapping recombinant human (h) TSP-2 constructs in collaboration with Dr. MaryAnn Accavitti-Loper and the University of Alabama-Birmingham Hybridoma Core.

Expression of TSP Modules Using pAcGP67.coco—We used the vector pAcGP67.coco to express the His-tagged TSP-derived constructs as secreted proteins using recombinant baculovirus (14Mosher D.F.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5270-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography. Some constructs contained permutations of parts of hTSP-1 and hTSP-2 and are described using nomenclature based on the modules present in the construct followed by a species and type designation (Fig. 1B). In addition, we studied E123CaG signature domain hybrids of hTSP-2 and hTSP-1 or of hTSP-2 and mTSP-2. The signature domain hybrids were designed to include three contiguous segments as follows: 1) the three EGF-like modules, 2) wire repeats 1C-8N, and 3) wire repeats 9C-13C and the lectin-like module. The first and the third segments were from the same species or type, and the second segment was from the other species or type. A construct that consists of mTSP-2 in the first and third segments and hTSP-2 in the second is thus named m2h2m2 (Fig. 1C). Finally, mutations of residues that differed between mouse and human TSP-1 or TSP-2 were introduced into E123CaG-1 from human or E123CaG-2 from mouse (Fig. 1, B and C). Purification of TSPs—TSP-1 was purified from releasate of thrombin-stimulated human platelets by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography and gel filtration on P-300 (Bio-Rad) as described (22Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1985; 66: 1098-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All buffers contained 0.1 mm Ca2+. Recombinant mTSP-2 (23Chen H. Sottile J. O'Rourke K.M. Dixit V.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mTSP-1 (13Chen H. Strickland D.K. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15993-15999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were purified as described. Recombinant hTSP-2 without His tags was purified using methods described previously for mTSP-2 (23Chen H. Sottile J. O'Rourke K.M. Dixit V.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Direct ELISA—Antigen was diluted to 10 μg/ml in TBS (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) plus either 0.3 mm Ca2+, 2.0 mm Ca2+, or 5 mm EDTA and used to coat 96-well microtiter plates (Costar 3590 high binding, Corning Glass) with 50 μl per well, for 16 h at 4 °C. Calcium was kept at the concentrations indicated in figure legends with the exception of Ca2+ titration experiments, in which the initial wash and blocking were with no Ca2+, and subsequent washing and antibody incubation was performed with the appropriate Ca2+ concentration. The plates were washed one time with TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked with 5% BSA in TBST for 1 h. After washing three times with TBST, the mAbs diluted appropriately in TBST containing the stated Ca2+ concentration were incubated with the plate for 2 h. Plates were washed four times with TBST plus the stated Ca2+ concentration. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was incubated with the plate for 1 h. After washing four times with TBST, Sigma 104 AP substrate at 1 mg/ml in TBS, pH 9.0, was added to each well. Color development was monitored at 405 nm. Competition ELISA—Antigen (5.0 nm TSP-1 purified from human platelets or 10.0 nm recombinant hTSP-2) was diluted in TBS plus 2 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EDTA and used to coat microtiter plates as in direct ELISA. The plates were washed one time with TBST and blocked with 5% BSA in TBST for 1 h. Calcium was kept at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. The recombinant TSP fragments (competitors) and the mAb being tested were diluted in TBST plus 0.1% BSA so that when combined the final concentrations for each competitor were 3.0, 1.0, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, or 0.01 μm, and the final concentration of the mAb was 0.5 μg/ml for C6.7 and HB8432, or a 1:50,000 dilution of ascites for 4B6.13. The competitors were added to the mAb in microcentrifuge tubes and allowed to incubate for 1 h before being added to the wells coated with TSP-1 or TSP-2. This competition mixture was incubated in the wells for 2 h. The plates were then washed four times with TBST plus the stated Ca2+ concentration. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was added, and the amount bound was quantified as above and compared with the absence of competitor. Statistics—All ELISA experiments were repeated, each with triplicate data points, on multiple occasions. Data are expressed as the mean of the different experiments ± S.E. Studies of 4B6.13 Anti-TSP-2—4B6.13 is a murine mAb raised against hTSP-2 that caught our interest in preliminary experiments because the epitope was present in hTSP-2 only when Ca2+ was present. We therefore mapped the 4B6.13 epitope. Intact hTSP-2, the complete signature domain of hTSP-2 (E123CaG-2), and portions of the signature domain (E3CaG-2, E3Ca-2, E3-2, and CaG-2) were tested with 4B6.13 in a direct ELISA in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. Only intact hTSP-2, E123CaG-2, and E3CaG-2 were reactive (not shown). A competition ELISA for adsorbed intact hTSP-2 was performed to evaluate the possibility that the lack of recognition of the smaller constructs in direct ELISA was because of altered conformation of adsorbed protein. Competition for 4B6.13 was found only when EGF3, the wire, and the lectin-like module were all present in the same construct (Fig. 2A). E123CaG-2 and E3CaG-2 competed equally well for 4B6.13 binding. These results indicate that the interactions among EGF3, the wire, and the lectin-like module control expression of the 4B6.13 epitope. 4B6.13 did not react with E123CaGs from hTSP-1 or mTSP-2 in direct (not shown) or competition ELISAs (Fig. 2A). Therefore, hybrid constructs were constructed to map the epitope of 4B6.13 within the E3CaG complex. The hybrids contained a complete signature domain, made up of segments of hTSP-2 in combination with segments of either mTSP-2 or hTSP-1 (Fig. 1C). The design of the hybrids was based on the interactions of the wire with EGF2 and EGF3, and the interactions of EGF3 with the lectin-like module as observed in the crystal structure of the Ca2+-replete signature domain of hTSP-2 (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). By keeping segments 1 and 3 from the same species and type, we sought to preserve these interactions and retain the integrity and structure of the signature domain. In competitive ELISA, E123CaG-2, m2h2m2, and h1h2h1 competed for 4B6.13 binding but h2h1h2 and h2m2h2 did not (Fig. 2B). The three constructs that competed for binding contained the hTSP-2 sequence in segment 2 (wire repeats 1C-8N), indicating that the 4B6.13 epitope is located within this segment. E123CaG-2 and m2h2m2 competed equally well. Human TSP-2 segment 2 in the context of hTSP-1 (h1h2h1) was ∼10-fold less effective (Fig. 2B). Thus, the epitope for 4B6.13 lies within repeats 1C-8N of the wire and requires surrounding segments, optimally from TSP-2. Of the 166 residues in segment 2, 8 differ between hTSP-2 and mTSP-2 and are found in three clusters (Fig. 1C). To determine where the 4B6.13 epitope is located, we made variations of m2h2m2 that contained each of these clusters, A, B, or C. In direct ELISA, 4B6.13 reacted with m2h2m2-A but not with m2h2m2-B or m2h2m2-C (Fig. 3), thus localizing the epitope to cluster A, i.e. to Leu-703 and His-722. Further mutations to the residues in m2h2m2-A were generated so that only one residue in each is unique to hTSP-2. These constructs, m2-Leu703 and m2-His722, were tested in direct ELISA (Fig. 3). 4B6.13 bound to m2-His722 and not to m2-Leu703, but the reaction with m2-His722 was only 60% of control compared when both residues are present as in m2h2m2-A and m2h2m2. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against mTSP-2 (13Chen H. Strickland D.K. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15993-15999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and hTSP-2 were mixed and demonstrated in a direct ELISA that equivalent amounts of the recombinant constructs used in the 4B6.13 ELISA were coated in the microtiter wells (data not shown). These results indicate that His-722 is the key residue in the 4B6.13 epitope but that Leu-703 also contributes to binding. The effect of Ca2+ on the binding of 4B6.13 to E123CaG-2, E3CaG-2, and the hybrids, m2h2m2 and h1h2h1, was tested in direct ELISA at varying Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 4). Binding required at least 0.14 mm Ca2+, and near maximum binding was reached by 0.2 mm Ca2+ for the constructs tested. Calcium titrations performed when the antigen had been adsorbed in EDTA were the same as when the antigen was adsorbed in 2.0 mm Ca2+ before addition of antibody and the test concentration of Ca2+ (data not shown). Thus, the adsorbed protein cycles reversibly between Ca2+-replete and Ca2+-depleted conformations that are associated with the expression or not of the 4B6.13 epitope, and the concentration of Ca2+ when the antibody is reacting with TSP-2 is the determining factor for binding. Studies of C6.7 Anti-hTSP-1—We tested available anti-hTSP-1 antibodies to learn if any, like 4B6.13, require the three elements of the signature domain for recognition. These experiments identified C6.7, which has been shown to bind to the EGF-like modules 1 and/or 2 (15Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All constructs that include the EGF1 and EGF2 modules (P3E123-1, E123-1, E123Ca-1, and E123CaG-1) competed for C6.7 binding to hTSP-1 (Fig. 5A). However, the recognition was ∼10-fold better when EGF1 and EGF2 are in a construct containing EGF3, the wire, and the lectin-like domain (E123CaG-1). This behavior is strikingly different from HB8432, which also recognizes an epitope in EGF-like modules 1 and/or 2 (15Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); all constructs that included the EGF1 and EGF2 domains competed for HB8432 binding similarly (Fig. 5B). The EGF1 and EGF2 modules were mutated to determine which residue or residues are responsible for binding of C6.7 and HB8432. Neither mAb reacts with mTSP-1 (15Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), so the amino acids that differ in EGF1 and -2 (Fig. 1B) were switched individually from the human to the mouse. These mutants were expressed in the context of the hTSP-1 signature domain construct, E123CaG-1. The mutants, E123CaG-1(wt) and mTSP-1, were compared in direct ELISA (Fig. 6) with C6.7, HB8432, or as a control A6.1, a mAb that reacts with wire repeat 1C of both human and mouse TSP-1 (15Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A6.1 reacted with all five mutants, E123CaG-1, and mTSP-1, whereas C6.7 and HB8432 reacted with E123CaG-1 and all of the mutants except for the E609K construct. Thus, Glu-609 in EGF2 is required for recognition by both C6.7 and HB8432, but only C6.7 requires the presence of the wire and lectin-like module for optimal recognition. The original characterization of C6.7 showed the ability of immobilized C6.7 to bind 125I-TSP was maintained at extremely low Ca2+ concentrations (11Dixit V.M. Galvin N.J. O'Rourke K.M. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1962-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the binding of C6.7 in the presence and absence of Ca2+ to the h1h2h1 construct in which epitopes for both 4B6.13 and C6.7 are present. When h1h2h1, E123CaG-1, and E123Ca-1 were tested in competition ELISA with C6.7, the C6.7 competition curves were similar regardless of Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 7A). The h1h2h1 hybrid competed much like E123CaG-1, exhibiting 10-fold better recognition than E123Ca-1, a construct lacking the lectin-like module. HB8342 antibody binding also was not affected by Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 7B). Monoclonal antibodies can be extremely useful probes to study structure-function relationships in conformationally liable proteins, e.g. integrins (24Humphries M.J. Symonds E.J. Mould A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Herein we describe two mAbs that recognize epitopes that are optimally present when the three elements of the signature domains of TSP-1 and TSP-2, the EGF-like modules, wire, and the lectin-like module, are in the same protein. Reactivities of the two mAbs to the various constructs are summarized in supplemental Table 1. One of these antibodies, 4B6.13 to hTSP-2, requires that the protein bind Ca2+. The other, C6.7 to hTSP-1, is indifferent to the absence or presence of Ca2+. Although the mAbs bind to separate members of the TSP family, both react with the h1h2h1 hybrid protein, with each mAb retaining the specific Ca2+ and domain requirements determined for E123CaG-1 and E123CaG-2. Calorimetric and spectroscopic studies, which indicate that the signature domain of TSP-2 functions as a complex structural unit that is influenced by the presence or absence of Ca2+ (6Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), are compatible with the requirements for exposure of the 4B6.13 epitope. The antibody only binds when EGF3, the wire, and the lectin-like module are present, and the complex is stabilized with Ca2+. The epitope for 4B6.13 is in repeat 1C of the wire and requires His-722 with a contribution from Leu-703. The crystal structure of the hTSP-2 signature domain (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) shows these two wire residues in close proximity not only to each other but also to residues that coordinate Ca2+ and interact with EGF3 and the lectin-like module (Fig. 8, A and B). The close proximity of the epitope to residues that coordinate Ca2+ is consistent with the sensitivity of the epitope to Ca2+ concentrations. The interactions needed for exposure of the epitope are maintained in the hybrids, demonstrating that intra-signature domain contacts critical for preserving the structure of the signature domain of hTSP-2 are functional in mTSP-2 and hTSP-1 as well. However, in competition ELISAs, h1h2h1 did not compete as well as E123CaG-2 or m2h2m2, which suggests a difference in the contributions of segments 1 and 3 of TSP-1 and TSP-2 to the exposure of the 4B6.13 epitope. Biophysical studies of E123CaG-2 are compatible with the preferred exposure of C6.7 in E123CaG-1 as compared with E123-1. The crystal structure of E123CaG-2 shows interactions of repeat 12N of the wire with EGF2 (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetry experiments revealed a difference in thermal stability between E3CaG-2 and E123CaG-2; the increase from 50.5 to 53.5 °C in the first melting transition is attributed to the interaction between the EGF-like modules 2 or 1 and the wire (5Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41229-41235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The hTSP-1-specific antibodies C6.7 and HB8432 each recognized epitopes that were lost when Glu-609 in EGF2 was changed to Lys, as occurs in mTSP-1. Both antibodies bound to the h1h2h1 hybrid construct that contains EGF2 from hTSP-1. Recognition by C6.7 was ∼10-fold better when EGF2 is in the framework of the complete signature domain than when EGF2 is in a construct of tandem EGF-like modules or EGF-like modules and wire. Thus, the interactions within the signature domain, presumably EGF2 with the wire and the lectin-like module with the wire and EGF3, affect the conformation and/or exposure of the C6.7 epitope. The structure of the complete hTSP-1 signature domain has not been solved, and must be modeled on the hTSP-2 structure (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In sequence alignments of hTSP-1 and hTSP-2, Glu-609 in hTSP-1 corresponds to Val-611 from hTSP-2. In the crystal structure Val-611 is positioned in an area near to where repeat 12N of the wire contacts EGF2 (Fig. 8, A and C). A strong argument can be made that the changes in the connecting strand and C-terminal globule of the TSPs upon removal of Ca2+, visualized by rotary shadowing EM, involve rearrangement of interactions among the stalk, wire, and lectin-like module that interact in the Ca2+-replete crystal structure (4Carlson C.B.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as measured from the intersection of the three chains in the oligomerization domain to the closest edge of the C-terminal globule, is ∼260 to 310 Å. This length matches the axial lengths of the modules of TSP between the N-terminal module and E3 as follows. The length of the oligomerization domain, as deduced from the structure of the coiled-coil region of cartilage matrix protein (27Wiltscheck R. Kammerer R.A. Dames S.A. Schulthess T. Blommers M.J. Engel J. Alexandrescu A.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), is likely about 50 Å. The vWF-C module has a length of ∼50 Å based on the NMR structure of the vWF-C module of type II collagen (28O'Leary J.M. Hamilton J.M. Deane C.M. Valeyev N.V. Sandell L.J. Downing A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53857-53866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); the properdin modules or TSRs of TSP-1 are each about 50 Å long (29Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Dong Y. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Lawler J. Wang J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the EGF-like modules 1 and 2 of TSP-2 are each about 30 Å long (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These measurements add up to a predicted length for the Ca2+-replete connecting strand of 250–310 Å, depending on how much of the oligomerization domain is included in the calculation. Therefore, the C-terminal globule visualized by rotary shadowing EM presumably includes E3, the wire, and the lectin-like module. Fig. 8A attempts to reconcile the immunochemical findings with rotary shadowing EM images demonstrating that removal of Ca2+ results in a decrease in size of the globular C region and an increase in length of the adjacent connecting strand (7Lawler J. Chao F.C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12257-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lawler J. Derick L.H. Connolly J.E. Chen J-H. Chao F.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 1962-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a comparison of Ca2+-replete versus EDTA-treated TSP-1, Lawler et al. (8Lawler J. Derick L.H. Connolly J.E. Chen J-H. Chao F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3762-3772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found a decrease in size of the shadowed C-terminal globule, from 120 ± 19 to 80 ± 7 Å, and an increase in length of the thin connecting strand, from 290 ± 46 to 380 ± 30 Å. Frazier and co-workers (9Galvin N.J. Dixit V.M. O'Rourke K.M. Santoro S.A. Grant G.A. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Dixit V.M. Galvin N.J. O'Rourke K.M. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1962-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also directly compared Ca2+-replete to EGTA-treated TSP-1 and found a decrease in size of the shadowed C-terminal globule from 170 ± 20 to 100 ± 20 Å and an increase in length of the thin connecting strand from 260 ± 40 to 430 ± 40 Å. Thus, when Ca2+ is removed from TSP, the two-dimensional size of the C-terminal globule decreases 1.5–1.7-fold, and the length of the connecting strand increases by 1.3–1.7-fold. In the models of Ca2+-depleted protein shown in Fig. 8A, EGF3 and the wire become part of the elongated stalk, and the lectin-like module comprises the bulk of the diminished C-terminal globule. The wire is made up of eight C and five N repeats, is stabilized by eight disulfides, and has a contour length of ∼170 Å (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, the wire extends from EGF3 to form a convoluted circle that loops back to interact with EGF2 and EGF3 and then courses toward the center of the circle where the lectin-like module is suspended (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The EGF3 module is a major organizer of the signature domain and acts as a “clasp” to close the circle formed by the wire (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Repeats 1C, 8N, and 9C interact with the lectin-like module, whereas repeats 2N to 7C course away from the lectin-like module to form a prominent opening of 14 × 40 Å (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The models of Ca2+-depleted protein are based on the premise that repeat 12N of the wire interacts with EGF2 in both the presence and absence of Ca2+, thus accounting for the higher affinity binding to the C6.7 epitope when the other parts of the signature domain are present. The wire is separated into sequences that are inside disulfide-bonded loops or outside the loops (Fig. 8A). Assuming that only sequences not constrained by disulfides can extend, we propose two models in which there is extension of one or two of the unconstrained sequences (Fig. 8A). In the first model (Fig. 8A, center), the residues between the cysteines in repeats 12N and 13C (1 residue from 12N and 14 from 13C) extend, and interactions of 8N and 9C with the lectin-like module are not maintained. In the alternate model (Fig. 8A, right), the interactions of repeats 8N and 9C with the lectin-like module are maintained, and in addition to the 15 residues between the cysteines in repeats 12N and 13C, the 15 residues between the cysteines in repeats 10N and 11C (1 residue from 10N and 14 from 11C) extend. In the models, lengthening of the tether to the lectin-like module is because of the extension of repeat 13C or, in the model in which 8N and 9C continue to interact with the lectin-like module, extension of repeats 11C and 13C. Full extension of the 15 residues between the cysteines in repeats 12N and 13C, or between 10N and 11C, would be ∼54 Å based on a length of 3.6 Å per residue. This distance added to the 30-Å length of EGF3 approximates the 90-Å elongation of the connecting strand found by Lawler et al. (8Lawler J. Derick L.H. Connolly J.E. Chen J-H. Chao F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3762-3772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 8A, center and right). The models are consistent with the site at which mAb A6.1, which binds to wire repeat 1C (15Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), decorated the stalk of EGTA-treated TSP-1 in rotary shadowing EM (9Galvin N.J. Dixit V.M. O'Rourke K.M. Santoro S.A. Grant G.A. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The A6.1-binding site was in a region of the connecting strand close to the remnant of the large globular region (9Galvin N.J. Dixit V.M. O'Rourke K.M. Santoro S.A. Grant G.A. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If the wire were to simply unroll, losing the interaction between 12N and EGF2, it could extend to the full contour length of ∼170 Å (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein A.D. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This length plus the 30 Å from EGF3 would increase the length of the connecting strand by ∼200 Å, which is greater than the 90 Å lengthening described by Lawler et al. (8Lawler J. Derick L.H. Connolly J.E. Chen J-H. Chao F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3762-3772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the 170 Å lengthening determined by Frazier and co-workers (9Galvin N.J. Dixit V.M. O'Rourke K.M. Santoro S.A. Grant G.A. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Dixit V.M. Galvin N.J. O'Rourke K.M. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1962-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the A6.1 epitope would be more equidistant between the N-terminal and C-terminal globules. In these models, the individual wire repeats, other than the one or two with extended sequences, keep their core structure. Persistence of the structure of 11 of the 13 repeats is consistent with far UV circular dichroism that demonstrates only a 10–20% loss in the absence of Ca2+ of the strong characteristic band of negative ellipticity at 204 nm that has been shown to arise from the wire (6Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, interactions between adjacent repeats are hypothesized to change upon depletion of Ca2+, allowing the wire to lose its Ca2+-replete contour and become part of the stalk. The requirements for optimal expression of the C6.7 epitope and the fact that the higher affinity of C6.7 for constructs that include the complete signature domain is maintained in the absence of Ca2+ have interesting implications. The interactions between EGF2 and the wire that stabilizes the epitope of C6.7 must be independent of Ca2+ binding in repeat 12N. However, the E123Ca-1 construct lacking the lectin-like module does not bind C6.7 with higher affinity even though EGF2 and repeat 12N are present. These observations suggest that during synthesis the lectin-like module is needed for proper folding of the signature domain, in particular for formation of the interaction between repeat 12N of the wire and the EGF2 module. Once the interaction is established, it is apparently maintained despite the dramatic structural changes caused by the removal of Ca2+. Preservation of the repeat 12N-EGF2 interaction and possibly of the repeat 8N/9C-lectin interaction would allow the signature domain to convert readily between its Ca2+-replete and Ca2+-depleted conformations.

https://openalex.org/W2126049745,"The mitotic arrest deficient 2 (MAD2) is suggested to play a key role in a functional mitotic checkpoint because of its inhibitory effect on anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) during mitosis. The binding of MAD2 to mitotic checkpoint regulators MAD1 and Cdc20 is thought to be crucial for its function and loss of which leads to functional inactivation of the MAD2 protein. However, little is known about the biological significance of this MAD2 mutant in human cells. In this study, we stably transfected a C-terminal-deleted MAD2 gene (MAD2ΔC) into a human prostate epithelial cell line, Hpr-1 and studied its effect on chromosomal instability, cell proliferation, mitotic checkpoint control and soft agar colony-forming ability. We found that MAD2ΔC was able to induce aneuploidy through promoting chromosomal duplication, which was a result of an impaired mitotic checkpoint and cytokinesis, suggesting a crucial role of MAD2-mediated mitotic checkpoint in chromosome stability in human cells. In addition, the MAD2ΔC-transfected cells displayed anchorage-independent growth in soft agar after challenged by 7,12-dimethylbenz[A]anthracene (DMBA), demonstrating a cancer-promoting effect of a defective mitotic checkpoint in human cells. Furthermore, the DMBA-induced transformation was accompanied by a complete loss of DNA damage-induced p53 response and activation of the MAPK pathway in MAD2ΔC cells. These results indicate that a defective mitotic checkpoint alone is not a direct cause of tumorigenesis, but it may predispose human cells to carcinogen-induced malignant transformation. The evidence presented here provides a link between MAD2 inactivation and malignant transformation of epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2004342539,"Proteolytic destruction of many cyclins is induced by a multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase termed the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the S phase cyclin Clb5 and the mitotic cyclins Clb1-4 are known as substrates of this complex. The relevance of APC/C in proteolysis of Clb5 is still under debate. Importantly, a deletion of the Clb5 destruction box has little influence on cell cycle progression. To understand Clb5 degradation in more detail, we applied in vivo pulse labeling to determine the half-life of Clb5 at different cell cycle stages and in the presence or absence of APC/C activity. Clb5 is significantly unstable, with a half-life of ∼8-10 min, at cell cycle periods when APC/C is inactive and in mutants impaired in APC/C function. A Clb5 version lacking its cyclin destruction box is similarly unstable. The half-life of Clb5 is further decreased in a destruction box-dependent manner to 3-5 min in mitotic or G1 cells with active APC/C. Clb5 instability is highly dependent on the function of the proteasome. We conclude that Clb5 proteolysis involves two different modes for targeting of Clb5 to the proteasome, an APC/C-dependent and an APC/C-independent mechanism. These different modes apparently have overlapping functions in restricting Clb5 levels in a normal cell cycle, but APC/C function is essential in the presence of abnormally high Clb5 levels.

The activity of these enzymes depends on the interaction with regulatory subunits, the cyclins. In yeast, nine cyclins are known to associate with the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1, also known as Cdc28 (1Mendenhall M.D. Hodge A.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62,: 1191-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bloom J. Cross F.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8,: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Six of these cyclins, Clb1-6, are members of the family of B-type cyclins. Two of these, Clb5 and Clb6, are expressed early in S phase and are required for the timely initiation of DNA replication (3Epstein C.B. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6,: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 4Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7,: 1160-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Activation of Cdk1 associated with S-cyclins requires the removal of the Sic1 protein (5Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79,: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 6Schneider B.L. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Science. 1996; 272,: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Proteolytic destruction of this Cdk1 inhibitor is initiated by Sic1 phosphorylation, mediated by G1-specific Cdk1 (7Verma R. Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Carr S.A. Reynard G. Deshaies R.J. Science. 1997; 278,: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The Clb1-4 cyclins are expressed later in the cell cycle and have important functions in the G2 and M phases (8Fitch I.

Cyclin-dependent kinase anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome fluorescence activated cell sorting Skp1/Cullin F-box protein hemagglutinin. Cyclins have important roles in the cell cycle regulation of Cdk1 activity and in establishing substrate specificity (2Bloom J. Cross F.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8,: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Cyclins are unstable proteins, and their rapid destruction is important for inactivation of Cdk1. Cyclin ubiquitination is mediated by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). This ubiquitin ligase is a large complex consisting of 13 subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has a highly conserved function in eukaryotes (10Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7,: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). APC/C activity requires the association of coactivators, either Cdc20 or Cdh1, which are involved in recognition and recruitment of substrates to the APC/C core complex. Coactivators bind directly to destruction motifs, the D-box (KXXLXXXXN) or the KEN box of substrates (11Burton J.L. Tsakraklides V. Solomon M.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18,: 533-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Kraft C. Vodermaier H.C. Maurer-Stroh S. Eisenhaber F. Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18,: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Cdc20 activates APC/C in metaphase, when all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle, whereas Cdh1 binds APC/C in late anaphase and keeps the ubiquitin-ligase active during G1 phase (10Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7,: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Five of the six Clb cyclins are known to be substrates of the APC/C. The sole exception is Clb6, which recently was identified as a substrate of another ubiquitin ligase, the Skp1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) complex (13Jackson L.P. Reed S.I. Haase S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26,: 2456-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Clb5, the second S phase cyclin, seems to be degraded by an APC/C-dependent process (14Irniger S. Nasmyth K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110,: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but in contrast to the mitotic Clb cyclins, it was observed that Clb5 was unstable throughout the cell cycle (15Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373,: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 16Jacobson M.D. Gray S. Yuste-Rojas M. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20,: 4483-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Different previous studies came to opposite conclusions concerning the importance of APC/C in controlling Clb5 levels. Initially, a clb5 mutation was identified in a screening for suppressors of the lethality of a strain lacking the essential coactivator Cdc20 and the securin Pds1 (17Shirayama M. Toth A. Galova M. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 402,: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The viability of a cdc20Δ pds1Δ clb5Δ mutant suggested that Clb5 degradation is a key process of APC/C-Cdc20. Subsequent experiments, however, demonstrated that a deletion of the D-box of Clb5 did not cause defects in mitosis, in contrast to a stabilized version cyclin Clb2 lacking the D-box that efficiently blocked exit from mitosis (18Wasch R. Cross F.R. Nature. 2002; 418,: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The presence of Clb5 without destruction box did not significantly affect cell cycle progression, although protein levels of this version of Clb5 were deregulated compared with normal Clb5. These data implied that APC/C-mediated proteolysis of Clb5 is not essential for cell cycle progression. Later data showed that cells lacking essential APC/C subunits were viable in the presence of very high levels of the Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1, but only in a strain containing deletions of the PDS1 and CLB5 genes (19Thornton B.R. Chen K.C. Cross F.R. Tyson J.J. Toczyski D.P. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3,: 629-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments showing that cells can survive without APC/C under specific conditions raised again the model that Clb5 is a key target of APC/C. These conflicting data on the role of APC/C in Clb5 proteolysis prompted us to perform a comprehensive analysis of the cell cycle regulation of Clb5 stability by applying in vivo pulse labeling experiments. Our data on Clb5 stability imply that Clb5 degradation involves at least two different pathways, one APC/C-dependent and one APC/C-independent. We further found that Clb5 instability is highly dependent on the 26 S proteasome but independent of the SCF ubiquitin ligase. Yeast Strains—All strains are derivatives of the S. cerevisiae W303 strain. The strains are listed in Table 1. Yeast strains were usually produced by crossing of strains from opposite mating types, subsequent sporulation and tetrad dissection with a micromanipulator.

The media were supplemented with either 2% glucose or 2% raffinose as carbon sources. Prior to gene expression from the GAL1 promoter, the cells were pregrown in raffinose medium. The GAL1 promoter was induced by the addition of galactose (final concentration, 2%). To turn off the GAL1 promoter, the cells were filtered, washed, and resuspended in medium containing 2% glucose. To arrest cells in G1 phase, α-factor pheromone was added to exponentially growing cultures, and the cells were incubated for 2.5 h in the presence of 5 μg/ml α-factor. For all pheromone arrests, strains hypersensitive to α-factor by bar1 mutations were used. For cell cycle arrest in S phase, the cells were treated with 5 mg/ml hydroxyurea. To arrest cells in metaphase, the cultures were incubated for 2.5 h in the presence of 15 μg/ml of the microtubuli-depolymerizing drug nocodazole (added from a 1.5 mg/ml stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide). To arrest cells by temperature-sensitive mutations, the cells were pregrown at 25 °C and then shifted for 2.5 h to 36 °C. Pulse Labeling Experiments—To determine the half-life of proteins, pulse labeling experiments were performed as described (21Amon A. Irniger S. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 77,: 1037-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were pregrown in minimal medium lacking methionine and containing raffinose as the sole carbon source. The GAL1 promoter was induced by galactose addition (2% end concentration). For in vivo labeling, 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine was added, and the cells were incubated for 5 min (pulse), followed by the addition of 2 mm unlabeled methionine (chase). At the same time, glucose (final concentration, 2%) was added to turn off the promoter. The samples were collected at specific time points after the chase. The cells were broken with glass beads, and immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-hemagglutinin antibodies (anti-HA, 1:10 dilutions). Proteins were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the bands were quantified with a Fuji phosphorimager. To verify cell cycle arrests, DNA content was determined by FACS analysis. The cultures for FACS analysis were treated similarly to the main culture except that [35S]methionine was omitted. Immunoblot Analysis—Preparation of yeast cell extracts and protein immunoblot analysis were performed as described (22Surana U. Amon A. Dowzer C. McGrew J. Byers B. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1993; 12,: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the detection of specific proteins. The antibodies were used in 1:1000 (HA) or 1:2000 (Cdc28) concentrations. FACS Analysis and Immunofluorescence—To determine the DNA content of cells, FACS analysis was performed as previously described (3Epstein C.B. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6,: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), using a Becton-Dickinson FACScan. The cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with propidiumiodide. For indirect immunofluorescence, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. The spheroplasts were prepared as described (23Pringle J.R. Adams A.E. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194,: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and anti-tubulin antibodies (YOL37, 1:60 dilution) were used for visualization of nuclei and spindles, respectively. Determination of the Half-lives of Clb5 and Clb5ΔDB at Different Cell Cycle Stages—Previously, Clb5 stability has been analyzed by promoter shut-off experiments with the glucose-repressible GAL1 promoter (15Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373,: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 16Jacobson M.D. Gray S. Yuste-Rojas M. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20,: 4483-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A comprehensive analysis of Clb5 stability by pulse labeling experiments has not been performed up to present, and therefore the knowledge of the accurate half-life of this protein is unclear. We applied this method to determine the half-life of Clb5 at different stages of the cell cycle. The stability of a cyclin destruction box mutant of Clb5, termed here Clb5ΔDB, was also measured. Yeast strains carrying HA3-tagged versions of Clb5 or Clb5ΔDB expressed from the inducible GAL1 promoter were arrested at specific periods of the cell cycle. First, we determined the half-life of Clb5 and Clb5ΔDB in the absence of APC/C activity, in cells arrested in metaphase with the spindle depolymerizing drug nocodazole. Upon cell cycle arrest, galactose was added to express the GAL1-CLB5-HA3 or GAL1-CLB5ΔDB-HA3 constructs. The cells were incubated for 5 min with radiolabeled [35S]methionine and then chased with an excess of unlabeled methionine. Clb5 was immunoprecipitated from samples collected at different periods after the chase. Pulse labeling experiments showed that Clb5 and Clb5ΔDB were similarly unstable in metaphase cells (Fig. 1A). The half-life of both proteins was ∼8-10 min. This instability indicates that Clb5 is subject to a degradation mechanism independent of the destruction box and of APC/C activity. Destruction Box Further Destabilizes Clb5 in Late Mitosis and G1 Phase—To test the degradation of Clb5 and Clb5ΔDB later in mitosis, we used cdc15-2 mutants, impaired in a protein kinase essential for the exit from mitosis. cdc15-2 mutants carrying GAL1-CLB5-HA3 or GAL1-CLB5ΔDB-HA3 constructs were arrested in telophase by a shift to a restrictive temperature, 36 °C. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the half-life of Clb5 is further reduced to less than 5 min, whereas the stability of Clb5ΔDB is only modestly different from metaphase-arrested cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, a further destabilization of Clb5 occurs during anaphase, consistent with the findings that Clb5 is a substrate of APC/C-Cdc20, which is highly active in telophase cells (24Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149,: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To compare the stability of Clb5 and Clb5ΔDB in G1 phase, the cells were arrested in the G1 phase with the pheromone α-factor. In this period of the cell cycle, APC/C-Cdh1 is active (25Schwab M. Lutum A.S. Seufert W. Cell. 1997; 90,: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 26Visintin R. Prinz S. Amon A. Science. 1997; 278,: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). We found that Clb5 is more unstable than Clb5ΔDB in pheromone-arrested G1 cells (Fig. 1C). The half-life of Clb5 in these cells is ∼5 min. These findings support the model that Clb5 is unstable throughout the cell cycle and that a more rapid Clb5 turnover occurs during telophase and the G1 phase in an APC/C-dependent manner. Clb5 Is Degraded by an APC/C-independent Pathway—The instability of Clb5 and of Clb5ΔDB in metaphase (Fig. 1A) suggests that Clb5 is degraded by a process independent of APC/C. To underline this assumption, we determined Clb5 stability in temperature-sensitive mutants defective in APC/C function, cdc16-123 and cdc23-1. The half-life of Clb5 was measured in G1-arrested mutant strains. The cells were first arrested at the permissive temperature in the G1 phase by the addition of α-factor. Subsequently, the cells were shifted to the restrictive temperature, and then pulse-labeling experiments were performed in the presence of the pheromone. Clb5 was unstable in both mutants with a half-life of ∼10 min but moderately stabilized compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2A). FACS analysis confirmed that cells did not escape from the G1 arrest during the course of the experiment. To further exclude the possibility that cells lacking APC/C are not properly arrested in the G1 phase, we used cdc28-4 mutants combined with mutants in APC/C functions. The cdc28-4 mutation prevents cells from entering S phase upon the temperature shift. We tested Clb5 stability in G1-arrested cdc28-4 cdc23-1 and cdc28-4 apc10-22 double mutants. The cells were arrested in the G1 phase at the permissive temperature, and then Clb5 stability was determined at the restrictive temperature. In both double mutants, Clb5 was more stable than in the cdc28-4 single mutant but still significantly unstable (Fig. 2B). It cannot be completely ruled out that residual APC/C activity contributes to Clb5 instability in G1-arrested mutants. To further support the model that Clb5 proteolysis is independent of APC/C, we performed pulse labeling experiments with cdc23-1 cells arrested in metaphase, when APC/C is inactive. Wild-type and cdc23-1 mutants were arrested in metaphase with nocodazole at the permissive temperature. Upon a shift to 36 °C, the half-life of Clb5 was measured. In both strains, Clb5 stability was similar, with a half-life of ∼10 min (Fig. 2C). Thus, even in cdc23-1 mutants arrested in a period of the cell cycle when APC is inactive, Clb5 is still unstable. These data underline that an APC/C-independent mechanism contributes to Clb5 proteolysis. Mitotic Cyclins Are More Stable than Clb5 in the Absence of APC/C Activity—After having determined the half-life of Clb5 by pulse labeling, we applied the more convenient promoter shut-off method for further experiments. Although not as precise in the determination of the half-lives of proteins, the application of this method provided results of sufficient clarity. We next tested whether Clb5 is indeed more unstable than mitotic cyclins in the absence of APC/C activity. Therefore, we compared the stability of Clb5 with the stability of Clb2 and Clb3 in cells arrested in metaphase. Strains carrying HA-tagged versions of these cyclins expressed from the GAL1 promoter were arrested with nocodazole. Then the expression of cyclin genes was induced by galactose addition, followed by a shift to glucose medium. In accordance with the pulse labeling experiments in Fig. 1A, Clb5 is rapidly degraded (Fig. 3). In contrast, Clb2 and Clb3 levels decreased slowly in these metaphase-arrested cells. These data underline that Clb5, but not Clb2 or Clb3, is subject to a distinct APC-independent mode of proteolysis. Clb5 Instability Depends on the Proteasome—We next tested whether the persistent instability of Clb5 during the cell cycle requires the function of the proteasome. To this end, the stability of Clb5 was analyzed in mutants impaired in the function of the proteasome, the temperature-sensitive cim3-1 and cim5-1 mutants (27Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366,: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Cim3, also known as Sug1/Rpt6, and Cim5, also known as Rpt1, are both ATPases of the regulatory 19 S particle of the 26 S proteasome and essential for viability (28Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68,: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). To determine the stability of Clb5, promoter shut-off experiments were performed at the restrictive temperature. We found that Clb5 was virtually stable during the course of the experiment (Fig. 4A). Similar experiments were performed with cell cycle-arrested cells by nocodazole treatment of cells prior to the promoter shut-off experiments (Fig. 4B). Also in these arrested cells, Clb5 appeared to be distinctly stabilized compared with wild-type cells. We conclude that Clb5 degradation is highly dependent on the function of the 26 S proteasome. Clb5 Instability Does Not Involve the SCF Ubiquitin Ligase—The findings that Clb5 is targeted to the proteasome by an APC/C-independent process prompted us to test whether this alternative mode may be mediated by the activity of the SCF ubiquitin ligase. Remarkably, the S phase cyclin Clb6 was recently identified as a SCF-Cdc4 target (13Jackson L.P. Reed S.I. Haase S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26,: 2456-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Involvement of SCF in Clb5 proteolysis had been suggested earlier by Bai et al. (29Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86,: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), whereas data from Wasch and Cross (18Wasch R. Cross F.R. Nature. 2002; 418,: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) resulted in opposite conclusions. These experiments, however, were performed in dividing cells and did not uncouple the APC/C-dependent and APC/C-independent degradation modes. To exclude APC/C activity, we used S or M phase-arrested cells. To test whether SCF is involved in Clb5 degradation, we compared wild-type and cdc34-2 mutants. CDC34 encodes the essential E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme of the yeast SCF complex (30Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241,: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The cells were arrested in the S phase or metaphase with hydoxyurea or nocodazole, respectively. Then promoter shut-off experiments were performed. Clb5 and Clb5ΔDB were both unstable in these arrested mutant cells, similar to wild-type cells (Fig. 5, A and B). To further support the idea that Clb5 is degraded by a pathway independent of APC/C and SCF, we constructed yeast strains with temperature-sensitive mutations causing defects in both ubiquitin ligases, cdc34-2 cdc23-1 double mutants. Promoter shut-off experiments showed that Clb5 are significantly unstable in this yeast strain, similar to a cdc23-1 mutant (Fig. 5C). By performing similar experiments as described in Fig. 5A, we found that Clb5 was also unstable in cdc53-1 and cdc4-1 mutants (Fig. 5D). Cdc53 is the cullin subunit of SCF, and Cdc4 is an F-box protein (29Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86,: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 31Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N. Kobayashi R. Wittenberg C. Tyers M. Cell. 1996; 86,: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Thus, targeting of Clb5 to the 26 S proteasome can apparently occur by a pathway independent of the two ubiquitin-ligases with known roles in cell cycle progression, APC/C and SCF. APC/C-mediated Clb5 Degradation Is Essential under Conditions of Elevated CLB5 Expression Levels—It was previously shown that CLB5ΔDB expressed from its own promoter does not exhibit distinct cell cycle defects, whereas GAL1-CLB5ΔDB is toxic to yeast cells (16Jacobson M.D. Gray S. Yuste-Rojas M. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20,: 4483-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The APC/C-independent pathway may be sufficient for Clb5 proteolysis in a normal cell cycle but not when CLB5 is overexpressed. To test the relevance of APC/C in the presence of abnormally high levels of Clb5, we analyzed the elevated CLB5 expression in cdc23-1 mutants. The viability of cdc23-1 mutants containing a single copy of GAL1-CLB5-HA3 was tested on galactose plates (Fig. 6A). cdc23-1 mutants are viable at 25 °C, but the expression of elevated levels of CLB5 was highly deleterious for this mutant. The toxicity of high levels of Clb5 to cdc23-1 mutants was comparable with increased CLB2 expression. The expression of GAL1-CLB5 had no discernible effects on wild-type cells. In contrast, high levels of Clb5 affected the viability of additional temperature-sensitive mutants, cdc16-123 and apc10-22. Both of these strains defective in APC/C subunit genes are viable at 28 °C, but the expression of GAL1-CLB5 inhibited growth. The findings that cells impaired in APC/C function are sensitive to high levels of Clb5 even at permissive temperatures implies that the alternative degradation pathway is not sufficient to control Clb5 as soon as this cyclin is expressed to high levels. Under these conditions, APC/C gets essential for Clb5 degradation. Remarkably, increased CLB5 expression in cdc23-1 mutants caused a cell cycle arrest, which differed from CLB2 expression. GAL1-CLB2 resulted in an uniform telophase arrest in cdc23-1 mutants (Fig. 6B). In contrast, in cdc23-1 mutants expressing CLB5, only ∼30% of cells contained divided nuclei and elongated spindles. Most cells had short spindles and undivided nuclei, indicating that cells were arrested predominantly prior to anaphase. These data support the model that high Clb5 levels do not inhibit the exit from mitosis (18Wasch R. Cross F.R. Nature. 2002; 418,: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). APC/C Is Required for Preventing S Phase Entry in Cells Expressing High Levels of CLB5—We also tested the relevance of APC/C-mediated degradation of Clb5 in G1-arrested cells. Strains expressing CLB5 and CLB5ΔDB from its own promoter and strains expressing either CLB5 or CLB5ΔDB from the GAL1 promoter were arrested with α-factor in the G1 phase. Galactose was added, and the incubation in the presence of pheromone was continued. We found that DNA replication did not occur in cells expressing high levels of CLB5, whereas the expression of GAL1-CLB5ΔDB efficiently triggered the initiation of DNA replication (Fig. 7A). This is most likely due to the appearance of the Clb5ΔDB protein, which accumulated to higher levels than normal Clb5 (Fig. 7B). Cells containing CLB5ΔDB expressed from its own promoter did not initiate DNA replication (Fig. 7A). An important process for the initiation of DNA replica"
