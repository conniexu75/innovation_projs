https://openalex.org/W1966836232,"The prospect of manipulating matter on the atomic scale has fascinated scientists for decades. This fascination may be motivated by scientific and technological opportunities, or from a curiosity about the consequences of being able to place atoms in a particular location. Advances in scanning tunneling microscopy have made this prospect a reality; single atoms can be placed at selected positions and structures can be built to a particular design atom-by-atom. Atoms and molecules may be manipulated in a variety of ways by using the interactions present in the tunnel junction of a scanning tunneling microscope. Some of these recent developments and some of the possible uses of atomic and molecular manipulation as a tool for science are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2035387192,"The diazotrophic cyanobacterium Trichodesmium is a large (about 0.5 by 3 millimeters) phytoplankter that is common in tropical open-ocean waters. Measurements of abundance, plus a review of earlier observations, indicate that it, rather than the picophytoplankton, is the most important primary producer (about 165 milligrams of carbon per square meter per day) in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium introduces the largest fraction of new nitrogen to the euphotic zone, approximately 30 milligrams of nitrogen per square meter per day, a value exceeding the estimated flux of nitrate across the thermocline. Inclusion of this organism, plus the abundant diazotrophic endosymbiont Richelia intracellularis that is present in some large diatoms, in biogeochemical studies of carbon and nitrogen may help explain the disparity between various methods of measuring productivity in the oligotrophic ocean. Carbon and nitrogen fixation by these large phytoplankters also introduces a new paradigm in the biogeochemistry of these elements in the sea."
https://openalex.org/W2037137116,"The high-temperature structure of solvent-free C(70) has been determined with high-resolution x-ray powder difraction and electron microscopy. Samples crystallized from solution form hexagonal close-packed crystals that retain an appreciable amount of residual toluene, even after prolonged heating. Samples prepared by sublimation, which contain no detectable solvent, are primarily face-centered cubic with some admixture of a hexagonal phase. The relative volume of the hexagonal phase can be further reduced by annealing. The structures of both phases are described by a model of complete orientational disorder. The cubic phase contains an appreciable density of stacking faults along the [111] direction."

Modification of these structures to confine the electrons to one dimension (quantum wires) or release them in the third dimension, are predicted to lead to new electrical and optical properties. This article discusses techniques to make quantum wires, and quantum wells of controlled size and shape, from compound semiconductor materials, and describes some of the properties of these structures."
https://openalex.org/W2093424293,Tobacco plants that are somatic mosaics for expression of a cytokinin-synthesizing gene have viviparous leaves. Such a formation of shoots in an abnormal position represents a significant deviation from the usual organization of the plant body where a central axis produces shoots only in the axils of lateral leaf appendages and according to a precise phyllotactic pattern. This report links vivipary to the expression of a gene whose product is involved in the synthesis of the phytohormone cytokinin.
https://openalex.org/W2026518075,"An empirical model of carbon flux and (14)C-derived ages of the water in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean as a function of depth was used to estimate the long-term rate of primary production within this region. An estimate can be made because the deep waters of the Canadian Basin are isolated from the world oceans by the Lomonosov Ridge (sill depth about 1500 meters). Below the sill, the age of the water correlates with increased nutrients and oxygen utilization and thus provides a way to model the average flux of organic material into the deep basin over a long time period. The (14)C ages of the deep water in the Canada Basin were about 1000 years, the carbon flux across the 1500-meter isobath was 0.3 gram of carbon per square meter per year, and the total production was 9 to 14 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Such estimates provide a baseline for understanding the role of the Arctic Ocean in global carbon cycling."

https://openalex.org/W2065229167,"THIS reference is of great interest. As I have shown in the Introduction to my recent book upon “Age and Area,” both Lyell and Hooker had conceived the ideas which I have elaborated. The incoming of the Darwinian theory of evolution, however, with its novel conception of universal gradual change, diverted effort from the lines that it was beginning to follow, and to which it shows signs of returning, with the increasing recognition of the fact that gradual change is not possible in the case of most characters."
