https://openalex.org/W2769525151,"The unexpectedly high flux of cosmic ray positrons detected at Earth may originate from nearby astrophysical sources, dark matter, or unknown processes of cosmic-ray secondary production. We report the detection, using the HighAltitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), of extended tera-electron volt gamma-ray emission coincident with the locations of two nearby middle-aged pulsars (Geminga and PSR B0656+14). The HAWC observations demonstrate that these pulsars are indeed local sources of accelerated leptons, but the measured tera-electron volt emission profile constrains the diffusion of particles away from these sources to be much slower than previously assumed. We demonstrate that the leptons emitted by these objects are therefore unlikely to be the origin of the excess positrons, which may have a more exotic origin."

This high-temperature process also releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Upham et al. used nickel dissolved in molten bismuth to pyrolyze methane to release hydrogen and form carbon, which floats to the surface of the melt, where it can be removed. Carbon formation on steam-reforming catalysts is usually a deactivating side reaction, but in the new process, the carbon can be stored or incorporated into composite materials.

To this end, nonobese diabetic (NOD).Cg-PrkdcscidIL2rgtm1Wjl/Sz (null; NSG) mice were transplanted with human (h)CD34+hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells, which leads to the development of human hematopoietic and immune systems [humanized NSG (HuNSG)]. HuNSG mice received human leukocyte antigen partially matched tumor implants from patient- derived xenografts [PDX; non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), sarcoma, bladder cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)] or from a TNBC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX). Tumor growth curves were similar in HuNSG compared with nonhuman immune-engrafted NSG mice. Treatment with pembrolizumab, which targets programmed cell death protein 1, produced significant growth inhibition in both CDX and PDX tumors in HuNSG but not in NSG mice. Finally, inhibition of tumor growth was dependent on hCD8+T cells, as demonstrated by antibody-mediated depletion. Thus, tumor-bearing HuNSG mice may represent an important, new model for preclinical immunotherapy research.—Wang, M., Yao, L.-C., Cheng, M., Cai, D., Martinek, J., Pan, C.-X., Shi, W., Ma, A.-H., De Vere White, R.

Yang et al. built a model for the North American power grid network based on samples of data covering the years 2008 to 2013 (see the Perspective by D'Souza). Although the observed cascades were widespread, a small fraction of all network components, particularly the ones that were most cohesive within the network, were vulnerable to cascading failures. Larger cascades were associated with concurrent triggering events that were geographically closer to each other and closer to the set of vulnerable components.

https://openalex.org/W2769672674,"Reversible detyrosination of α-tubulin is crucial to microtubule dynamics and functions, and defects have been implicated in cancer, brain disorganization, and cardiomyopathies. The identity of the tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase (TCP) responsible for detyrosination has remained unclear. We used chemical proteomics with a potent irreversible inhibitor to show that the major brain TCP is a complex of vasohibin-1 (VASH1) with the small vasohibin binding protein (SVBP). VASH1 and its homolog VASH2, when complexed with SVBP, exhibited robust and specific Tyr/Phe carboxypeptidase activity on microtubules. Knockdown of vasohibins or SVBP and/or inhibitor addition in cultured neurons reduced detyrosinated α-tubulin levels and caused severe differentiation defects. Furthermore, knockdown of vasohibins disrupted neuronal migration in developing mouse neocortex. Thus, vasohibin/SVBP complexes represent long-sought TCP enzymes."

Tubulin carboxypeptidases (TCPs) responsible for detyrosination have remained elusive for 40 years (see the Perspective by Akhmanova and Maiato). Aillaud et al. identified vasohibins as enzymes that perform the TCP function and found that their small interacting partner SBVP was essential for their activity. Vasohibin/SVBP complexes were involved in neuron polarization and brain cortex development. The authors also developed an inhibitor targeting this family of enzymes. Using a completely different strategy, Nieuwenhuis et al. also showed that vasohibins can remove the C-terminal tyrosine of α-tubulin. Science , this issue p. 1448 , p. 1453 ; see also p. 1381"

After binding microbial ligands, assorted NLR family members assemble to form enormous signaling complexes (inflammasomes), which promote pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and cell death. Tenthorey et al. used cryo-electron microscopy to visualize an assembled ligand-bound inflammasome. They find that when NAIP5 binds flagellin, it changes conformation, which triggers a rotation in monomeric NLRC4, catalyzing further NLRC4 recruitment. Steric clash results in a partially open structure, in contrast with previous descriptions of a closed symmetrical “wheel.” Furthermore, NAIP5 recognizes multiple regions of its ligand, and mutations of flagellin that allow for NAIP5 evasion compromise bacterial fitness.

Pendry et al. used concepts of transformation optics, in which metamaterials are designed to produce specific optical properties, to show theoretically that compacted dimensions could be possible in plasmonic structures. For example, simulations with a metallic grating and periodically doped graphene revealed that two-dimensional structures exhibit optical properties of a bulk material. To all intents and purposes, it looks as if one of the dimensions is compacted. The results could have practical application in designing broadband optical absorbers. Science , this issue p. 915"
https://openalex.org/W2769386556,"β-Arrestins are key regulators and signal transducers of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). The interaction between receptors and β-arrestins is generally believed to require both receptor activity and phosphorylation by GPCR kinases. In this study, we investigated whether β-arrestins are able to bind second messenger kinase–phosphorylated, but inactive receptors as well. Because heterologous phosphorylation is a common phenomenon among GPCRs, this mode of β-arrestin activation may represent a novel mechanism of signal transduction and receptor cross-talk. Here we demonstrate that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol myristate acetate, Gq/11-coupled GPCR, or epidermal growth factor receptor stimulation promotes β-arrestin2 recruitment to unliganded AT1 angiotensin receptor (AT1R). We found that this interaction depends on the stability lock, a structure responsible for the sustained binding between GPCRs and β-arrestins, formed by phosphorylated serine–threonine clusters in the receptor’s C terminus and two conserved phosphate-binding lysines in the β-arrestin2 N-domain. Using improved FlAsH-based serine-threonine clusters β-arrestin2 conformational biosensors, we also show that the stability lock not only stabilizes the receptor–β-arrestin interaction, but also governs the structural rearrangements within β-arrestins. Furthermore, we found that β-arrestin2 binds to PKC-phosphorylated AT1R in a distinct active conformation, which triggers MAPK recruitment and receptor internalization.

https://openalex.org/W2768566603,"Reporter proteins have broad applications in visualizing molecular events at the cellular, tissue and whole-body levels. Transmembrane transporters recognizing specific molecular domains are of particular interest because they enable the migration of signal-source molecules from the extracellular space to the cytoplasm for subsequent application in multimodality imaging. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) have demonstrated their MRI reporter efficacy. We further expanded their use as a dual-modality reporter in MRI and noninvasive in vivo imaging system (IVIS). We overexpressed OATP1B3 in the HT-1080 sarcoma cell line. Both Gd-EOB-DTPA, an MRI contrast agent, and indocyanine green (ICG), a near-infrared fluorescent dye that provides better deep-tissue detection because of its long wavelength, could be delivered to the intracellular space and imaged in a tumor-bearing nude mouse model. Our in vivo dual-imaging reporter system achieved high sensitivity in MRI and observation periods lasting as long as 96 h in IVIS. Because of the superior temporal and spatial resolutions and the clinical availability of both ICG and Gd-EOB-DTPA, this dual-imaging OATP1B3 system will find biomedical use in tumor biology, stem cell trafficking, and tissue engineering.-Wu, M.-R., Liu, H.-M., Lu, C.-W., Shen, W.-H., Lin, I.-J., Liao, L.-W., Huang, Y.-Y., Shieh, M.-J., Hsiao, J.-K.

Post-translational modifications such as small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation have emerged as critical molecular regulatory mechanisms in states of both homeostasis and ischemic stress, as evidenced by our previous work. Accordingly, the clinical significance of the selective control of the global SUMOylation process has become apparent in studies of ischemic pathobiology and pathophysiology.

https://openalex.org/W2770241934,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression. In this study, we observed that DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) expression is decreased after muscle atrophy. We made skeletal muscle-specific Dnmt3a-knockout (Dnmt3a-KO) mice. The regeneration capacity after muscle injury was markedly decreased in Dnmt3a-KO mice. Diminished mRNA and protein expression of Dnmt3a were observed in skeletal muscles as well as in satellite cells, which are important for muscle regeneration, in Dnmt3a-KO mice. Dnmt3a-KO satellite cell showed smaller in size (length/area), suggesting suppressed myotube differentiation. Microarray analysis of satellite cells showed that expression of growth differentiation factor 5 (Gdf5) mRNA was markedly increased in Dnmt3a-KO mice. The DNA methylation level of the Gdf5 promoter was markedly decreased in Dnmt3a-KO satellite cells. In addition, DNA methylation inhibitor azacytidine treatment increased Gdf5 expression in wild-type satellite cells, suggesting Gdf5 expression is regulated by DNA methylation. Also, we observed increased inhibitor of differentiation (a target of Gdf5) mRNA expression in Dnmt3a-KO satellite cells. Thus, Dnmt3a appears to regulate satellite cell differentiation via DNA methylation. This mechanism may play a role in the decreased regeneration capacity during atrophy such as in aged sarcopenia.-Hatazawa, Y., Ono, Y., Hirose, Y., Kanai, S., Fujii, N.

The molecular mechanisms and therapeutic value of CXCR7 in CNV remain undefined. In this study, experimental CNV was induced by laser photocoagulation in Brown-Norway pigmented rats, and aberrant CXCR7 overexpression was detected in the retinal pigment epithelial/choroid/sclera tissues of laser-injured eyes. Blockade of CXCR7 activation via CXCR7 knockdown or neutralizing Ab administration inhibited SDF-1-induced cell survival and the tubular formation of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) in vitro and reduced CNV leakage and lesion size in vivo. By using microRNA array screening and bioinformatic analyses, we identified miR-539-5p as a regulator of CXCR7. Transfection of HRMECs and choroid-retinal endothelial (RF/6A) cells with the miR-539-5p mimic inhibited their survival and tube formation, whereas CXCR7 overexpression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-539-5p. The antiangiogenic activities of the miR-539-5p mimic were additionally demonstrated in vivo by intravitreal injection. ERK1/2 and AKT signaling downstream of CXCR7 is involved in the miR-539-5p regulation of endothelial cell behaviors. These findings suggest that the manipulation of miR-539-5p/CXCR7 levels may have important therapeutic implications in CNV-associated diseases.-Feng, Y., Wang, J., Yuan, Y., Zhang, X., Shen, M., Yuan, F. miR-539-5p inhibits experimental choroidal neovascularization by targeting CXCR7."

In addition to a regulatory metal, most PerRs require a structural metal for proper dimeric assembly. We present here a structural and functional characterization of the PerR from the pathogenic spirochete Leptospira interrogans, a rare example of PerR lacking a structural metal-binding site. In vivo studies showed that the leptospiral PerR belongs to the peroxide stimulon in pathogenic species and is involved in controlling resistance to peroxide.

As a result, PerR dissociates from DNA, and target genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase. Leptospira are among the few examples of Gram-negative bacteria that possess a PerR-like regulator involved in controlling defenses against peroxide stress (12Lo M. Murray G.L. Khoo C.A. Haake D.A.

Leptospirosis is transmitted to animals and humans by exposure to soils and water contaminated with the urine of reservoir animals carrying pathogenic Leptospira. Once having penetrated an organism, Leptospira enter the bloodstream and rapidly disseminate to multiple tissues and organs, including kidney, liver, and lungs (15Adler B. Pathogenesis of leptospirosis: cellular and molecular aspects.Vet. Microbiol. 2014; 172 (24999234): 353-35810.1016/j.vetmic.2014.06.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).

Although recognized as an emerging disease and a significant health threat among impoverished populations in developing countries and tropical areas (17Costa F. Hagan J.E. Calcagno J. Kane M.

In addition, the lack of efficient tools and techniques for genetic manipulation of Leptospira spp. has greatly hampered our understanding of the mechanism of pathogenicity and virulence as well as the basic biology of this pathogen (13Ko A.I.

Several lines of evidence have indicated the importance of ROS production during infection by Leptospira.

In addition, catalase is required not only for survival in the presence of H2O2 but also for virulence (24Eshghi A. Lourdault K. Murray G.L. Bartpho T. Sermswan R.W. Picardeau M. Adler B. Snarr B. Zuerner R.L. Cameron C.E. Leptospira interrogans catalase is required for resistance to H2O2 and for virulence.Infect.

A model system for studying the transcriptomic and physiological changes associated with mammalian host-adaptation by Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24626166)e100400410.1371/journal.ppat.1004004Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest a role of PerR in the adaptation of pathogenic Leptospira to a mammalian host. An intriguing particularity of leptospiral PerR, in contrast to most Fur-like regulators, is the absence of a structural metal-binding site. To gain insight into this class of PerR and the molecular mechanism of PerR function in Leptospira, we have carried out a functional, biochemical, and structural characterization of this transcriptional regulator. We show that the binding of Leptospira interrogans PerR with its promoter region is metal-dependent, and we report the crystal structure of the homodimeric PerR from L. interrogans, which provides a snapshot of the metal-induced conformational switch required for DNA binding and dissociation. We have also investigated the effect of perR inactivation on the growth of Leptospira in conditions similar to those encountered in a mammalian host. Leptospira spp. encode a PerR ORF that shares about 30% amino acid identity with PerRs encoded by other bacteria (Campylobacter jejuni, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) (Fig. S1A). Alignment of the ORF sequence encoded by the pathogen L. interrogans serovar Copenhagenii (LIC12034, LiPerR) with that of the well-characterized B. subtilis (BsPerR) shows a conservation of the five residues (His37-Asp85-His91-His93-Asp104, BsPerR primary sequence numbering) that coordinate the regulatory metal (Fig. S1A). Surprisingly, the canonical Cys4 consensus motif that coordinates the structural metal (Cys96, Cys99, Cys136, and Cys139, BsPerR primary sequence numbering) required for PerR dimeric assembly is absent in the primary sequence of LiPerR. PerR orthologues in other Leptospira strains, including L. interrogans serovar Manilae (LManV2_280031), Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo-Bovis (LBJ_1600), and Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc (LEPBIa2461), also lack the Cys4 consensus motif (Fig. S1B). In contrast, this 4-cysteinate motif is conserved in all PerR regulators whose structures have previously been solved and in most PerR and Fur regulators from sequenced genomes. To characterize the conformation and assembly of a PerR devoid of a structural metal-binding site, we solved the crystal structure of the LiPerR. The protein crystallized as an asymmetric homodimer with two independent monomers (chains A and B) in the asymmetric unit. The electron density could be traced from residue 1 to 145 in both monomers. Each monomer adopts the characteristic two-domain organization of Fur-like regulators with an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal dimerization domain. The N-terminal domain (residues 1–84) contains four α-helices (H1–H4), followed by a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β1, β2) (Fig. 1). Helices H2, H3, and H4 form a trihelical bundle arranged in a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. The putative DNA-binding helix (H4, residues 54–68) is well conserved in other PerRs (Fig. S1). The C-terminal domain (residues 91–145) consists of a long helix (H5, residues 107–127) and three β strands (β3, β4, and β5) which are involved in dimerization of the regulator. The N- and C-terminal domains of each monomer are connected by a flexible hinge region (residues 85–90), which adopts significantly different conformations in monomers A and B (see below). The overall structure of monomer A is similar to that of the BsPerR-Zn-Mn structure (PDB entry 3F8N; Fig. 1) with the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (H2-H3-H4-β1-β2, residues 20–84) and the β-sheet of the dimerization domain (β3-β4-β5, residues 91–104 and 129–144) bearing the greatest structural similarities (r.m.s. deviations of 2.16 and 1.54 Å, respectively, for 70 and 30 structurally equivalent Cα atoms). In BsPerR, the regulatory metal (Fe2+ and Mn2+, as determined by in vivo studies (5Fuangthong M. Herbig A.F. Bsat N. Helmann J.D.

In the LiPerR crystal structure, zinc was the only metal present, as determined by X-ray fluorescence measurements. This metal is coordinated by residues His36, Asp84, His90, His92, and Asp103, which are nitrogen/oxygen donors (Fig. 2A). The regulatory metal-binding site is arranged as a distorted square pyramid with His92 at the apical position and His36, Asp84, His90, and Asp103 at the base. These residues can be closely superimposed with the corresponding residues in the BsPerR structure (Fig. 2A). As expected from the amino acid sequence, the crystal structure of LiPerR confirmed the absence of the canonical Cys4 consensus motif involved in the structural metal coordination (Fig. 2B). Three of the four canonical Cys4 residues of BsPerR (Cys96, Cys99, and Cys136) were structurally aligned with Asp95, Thr98, and Lys143, respectively, in LiPerR (Fig. 2B). This structural alignment differs from the amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. S1). In BsPerR, the structural zinc locks the three β strands (β3, β4, and β5) in close proximity to form a six-stranded β sheet that stabilizes the dimeric assembly (8Traore D.A. El Ghazouani A.

LiPerR crystallized as a dimer stabilized by helix H5 and a six-stranded β sheet formed by strands β3, β4, and β5 in the C-terminal domains of each monomer (Fig. 2C). The total buried surface area in the dimer interface is 3570 Å2. The β strands involved in dimerization of LiPerR and BsPerR adopt similar topology and can be closely superimposed (Fig. 2C), indicating that the β sheet could be formed, and dimerization occurred in the absence of a structural metal in LiPerR. Moreover, analysis of purified PerR by dynamic light scattering indicated that the protein is dimeric in solution (Fig. S2). Therefore, structural analysis of LiPerR shows that the absence of a structural metal-binding site does not affect the overall topology or oligomerization of the protein. In the crystallized LiPerR dimer, monomers A and B share similar overall folding within the individual N-terminal and C-terminal domains, with r.m.s. deviations for equivalent Cα positions of 0.47 and 0.70 Å, respectively (Fig. 3A), but the relative orientation of the two domains differs significantly, resulting in a globally asymmetric overall structure (Fig. 3, B and C). Superposition of the C-terminal domains of the two monomers shows that the centroid of the N-terminal DNA binding domain of monomer B was shifted by 22 Å from the position in monomer A (Fig. 3D). Zinc coordination in the regulatory metal-binding site of monomer A involves five amino acid residues (His36, Asp84, His90, His92, and Asp103) (Figs. 2A and 3B), whereas zinc coordination in monomer B involves only three residues (His90, His92, and Asp103), which are fully exposed in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3C). His36 and Asp84, which participate in the regulatory metal coordination in monomer A, are fully exposed in monomer B with main-chain Cα positions displaced by 22 and 16 Å, respectively (Fig. 3C). Consequently, His36 and Asp84 in monomer B do not participate in zinc coordination, leaving the partial metal-binding site exposed to solvent. Models of symmetrical dimers of LiPerR were generated by superimposing the C-terminal domains of monomers A and B, respectively. The modeled symmetrical dimer of monomer A, with complete regulatory metal coordination in both monomers, exhibits the typical caliper-like structure of Fur family regulators with the regulatory metal bound as in the Mn2+-bound conformation of BsPerR (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3). The symmetrical dimer of monomer B, in which the regulatory metal-binding sites are disrupted, has an open planar conformation (Fig. 4B) comparable with the apo-conformation of BsPerR (Fig. S3). The orientations of the two DNA-binding helices H4 in symmetrical dimers A and B dramatically differ, and the spacing is significantly greater in symmetrical dimer B. The two helices H4 are 32.6 Å apart in symmetrical dimer A (distance between the Cα atoms of the Lys63 in helix H4). The equivalent distance in the Mn2+-bound BsPerR (distance between the Cα atoms of Arg64) is 36 Å, suggesting that the symmetrical dimer A adopts a conformation suitable for DNA binding, whereas the conformation of symmetrical dimer B is incompatible with DNA binding. To investigate the ability of LiPerR to bind DNA, recombinant PerR was purified and incubated with a DNA fragment containing the perR promoter region. As shown in Fig. 5A, a 7.5-fold molar excess of PerR led to a total shift of DNA. However, this shift was not observed when an equivalent DNA fragment containing the dnaK promoter region was mixed with an excess of purified LiPerR (Fig. 5A) or when the assay was performed in the presence of 20 mm EDTA (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that LiPerR was able to bind its own promoter region in a metal-dependent manner. Preincubation of the purified proteins with Fe2+ in aerobic conditions inhibited the interaction of LiPerR with DNA, whereas preincubation with other metals (Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Ni+, or Zn2+) did not significantly affect the interaction with DNA (Fig. S4). Analysis of the metal content of the purified recombinant LiPerR by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Table S1) showed that the protein contained 0.18 and 0.39 molar eq of Zn2+ and Ni2+, respectively, per monomer. Fe2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ were present at negligible amounts. These ratios indicate that only a fraction of the PerR subunits contained bound metals. By expressing the recombinant protein in minimal medium and chelating metals after purification (extensive dialysis in the presence of EDTA and use of chelex-treated buffer), it was possible to lower the Ni2+ concentration to undetectable levels and the Zn2+ concentration to about 0.06 molar eq (Table S1). In this condition, LiPerR was still able to bind its promoter region, and this interaction was still inhibited by EDTA, indicating the involvement of a metal (Fig. S5). To test whether metal coordination was important for DNA binding, we substituted with alanine each of the residues of the regulatory metal-binding site. Single alanine substitutions of His36, Asp84, His90, or Asp103 did not affect DNA binding, but when His92 was replaced, LiPerR did not interact with DNA (Fig. 5B), suggesting that this residue plays a central role in maintaining the topology of the regulatory metal-binding site. A double alanine substitution of His36 and Asp84 also abolished the ability of LiPerR to bind DNA (Fig. 5B). It is noteworthy that these residues do not participate in regulatory metal binding in monomer B. These findings indicate that the impaired regulatory metal coordination in LiPerR is associated with a conformational switch to a non-DNA–binding state. In B. subtilis, derepression of PerR-regulated genes occurs through the oxidation of His37 and His91 by H2O2 or O2 (9Lee J.W. Helmann J.D. The PerR transcription factor senses H2O2 by metal-catalysed histidine oxidation.Nature. 2006; 440 (16541078): 363-36710.1038/nature04537Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 11Sethu R.

When LiPerR was incubated with H2O2 and subsequently mixed with the promoter region DNA fragment, we did not observe inhibition of DNA binding, but more distinctly resolved shifted bands were observed by EMSA when high H2O2 concentrations were used (Fig. S6), indicating that LiPerR was still able to bind DNA. Because neither Zn2+ nor Ni2+ are recognized as regulatory metals that catalyze the H2O2-mediated oxidation in previously characterized PerRs, the effects observed when LiPerR is pretreated with H2O2 are probably not physiologically meaningful. The association of PerR with DNA was also examined by DNase I footprinting experiments. In the presence of recombinant LiPerR purified without metal chelation (i.e. containing substoichiometric concentrations of Zn2+ and Ni2+), a sequence of 122 bp was protected (Fig. 6"
https://openalex.org/W2769958019,"Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) have attracted special attention in research aimed at modifying natural products by partial removal of sugar moieties to manipulate their solubility and efficacy. However, these modifications are challenging to control because the low substrate specificity of most GHs often generates undesired by-products. We previously identified a GH2-type fungal β-glucuronidase from Aspergillus oryzae (PGUS) exhibiting promiscuous substrate specificity in hydrolysis of triterpenoid saponins. Here, we present the PGUS structure, representing the first structure of a fungal β-glucuronidase, and that of an inactive PGUS mutant in complex with the native substrate glycyrrhetic acid 3-O-mono-β-glucuronide (GAMG). PGUS displayed a homotetramer structure with each monomer comprising three distinct domains: a sugar-binding, an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich, and a TIM barrel domain. Two catalytic residues, Glu414 and Glu505, acted as acid/base and nucleophile, respectively. Structural and mutational analyses indicated that the GAMG glycan moiety is recognized by polar interactions with nine residues (Asp162, His332, Asp414, Tyr469, Tyr473, Asp505, Arg563, Asn567, and Lys569) and that the aglycone moiety is recognized by aromatic stacking and by a π interaction with the four aromatic residues Tyr469, Phe470, Trp472, and Tyr473. Finally, structure-guided mutagenesis to precisely manipulate PGUS substrate specificity in the biotransformation of glycyrrhizin into GAMG revealed that two amino acids, Ala365 and Arg563, are critical for substrate specificity. Moreover, we obtained several mutants with dramatically improved GAMG yield (>95%). Structural analysis suggested that modulating the interaction of β-glucuronidase simultaneously toward glycan and aglycone moieties is critical for tuning its substrate specificity toward triterpenoid saponins."
https://openalex.org/W2770493378,"Whether approaches to chronically increase VEGF-A in the heart may have beneficial effects and prevent the development of heart failure, in part by improving cardiac perfusion, or whether this increase could have detrimental effects on cardiac performance in the aging heart, has not been tested yet. In this study, a genetic mouse model with a chronic increase in VEGF-A in the heart is shown to have increased cardiac angiogenesis and develop cardiac hypertrophy with enhanced basal cardiac performance with age progression. However, in aged hearts, this increase in VEGF-A was associated with higher expression of fetal cardiac genes and reduced cardiac performance after p-agonistic stress, features consistent with pathologic cardiac hypertrophy. Expression of Nod-like receptor protein (NLRP)-3 was increased in the hearts of the mice, and its genetic inactivation prevented increased fetal cardiac gene expression and partially rescued the impaired cardiac performance after p-agonistic stimulation in aged hearts without reducing cardiac angiogenesis or hypertrophy. Thus, although a chronic increase in cardiac VEGF-A may improve cardiac perfusion, long-term upregulation of VEGF-A leads to reduced cardiac performance under stress, an effect that can be partially inhibited by NLRP3 inactivation. Targeting NLRP3 shifts the VEGF-A-induced cardiac hypertrophy from a pathologic toward a more physiologic hypertrophy.—Marneros, A. G. Effects of chronically increased VEGF-A on the aging heart.

However, therapeutic effect of NTP on keloid cells has not been reported previously. We sought to investigate the effect of NTP treatment on keloid by comparing cell migration and collagen production of keloid (KFs) and normal fibroblasts (NFs) and determined the regulatory pathways involved. We assessed NTP effects on cell migration in KFs and NFs by the wound healing assay and measured the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), and collagen by western blot. Expression of the transforming growth factor-β and Type I collagen following NTP treatment was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence staining, and the Sircol collagen assay. NTP treatment increased cell migration and collagen production of NFs. However, it reduced these parameters in KFs. NTP reduced the expression of EGFR, STAT3, and Type I collagen in KFs but increased their levels in NFs. We revealed that NTP suppressed KF cell migration via down-regulation of EGFR and STAT3 and reduced collagen production via supressing transforming growth factor-β. Our data suggest that NTP may be a new therapeutic strategy for keloids."
https://openalex.org/W2768724133,"The bacterial second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) has emerged as a prominent mediator of bacterial physiology, motility, and pathogenicity. c-di-GMP often regulates the function of its protein targets through a unique mechanism that involves a discrete PilZ adaptor protein. However, the molecular mechanism for PilZ protein–mediated protein regulation is unclear. Here, we present the structure of the PilZ adaptor protein MapZ cocrystallized in complex with c-di-GMP and its protein target CheR1, a chemotaxis-regulating methyltransferase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This cocrystal structure, together with the structure of free CheR1, revealed that the binding of c-di-GMP induces dramatic structural changes in MapZ that are crucial for CheR1 binding. Importantly, we found that restructuring and repositioning of two C-terminal helices enable MapZ to disrupt the CheR1 active site by dislodging a structural domain. The crystallographic observations are reinforced by protein–protein binding and single cell–based flagellar motor switching analyses. Our studies further suggest that the regulation of chemotaxis by c-di-GMP through MapZ orthologs/homologs is widespread in proteobacteria and that the use of allosterically regulated C-terminal motifs could be a common mechanism for PilZ adaptor proteins. Together, the findings provide detailed structural insights into how c-di-GMP controls the activity of an enzyme target indirectly through a PilZ adaptor protein. The bacterial second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) has emerged as a prominent mediator of bacterial physiology, motility, and pathogenicity. c-di-GMP often regulates the function of its protein targets through a unique mechanism that involves a discrete PilZ adaptor protein. However, the molecular mechanism for PilZ protein–mediated protein regulation is unclear. Here, we present the structure of the PilZ adaptor protein MapZ cocrystallized in complex with c-di-GMP and its protein target CheR1, a chemotaxis-regulating methyltransferase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This cocrystal structure, together with the structure of free CheR1, revealed that the binding of c-di-GMP induces dramatic structural changes in MapZ that are crucial for CheR1 binding. Importantly, we found that restructuring and repositioning of two C-terminal helices enable MapZ to disrupt the CheR1 active site by dislodging a structural domain. The crystallographic observations are reinforced by protein–protein binding and single cell–based flagellar motor switching analyses.

Its closest homologue tetranectin binds to the kringle 4 domain of plasminogen and enhances its association with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) thereby enhancing plasmin production, but whether CLEC3A contributes to plasminogen activation is unknown. Here, we recombinantly expressed murine and human full-length CLEC3As as well as truncated forms of CLEC3A in HEK-293 Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) cells. We analyzed the structure of recombinant CLEC3A by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot, glycan analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, size-exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and electron microscopy; compared the properties of the recombinant protein with those of CLEC3A extracted from cartilage; and investigated its tissue distribution and extracellular assembly by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that CLEC3A mainly occurs as a monomer, but also forms dimers and trimers, potentially via a coiled-coil α-helix. We also noted that CLEC3A can be modified with chondroitin/dermatan sulfate side chains and tends to oligomerize to form higher aggregates. We show that CLEC3A is present in resting, proliferating, and hypertrophic growth-plate cartilage and assembles into an extended extracellular network in cultures of rat chondrosarcoma cells. Further, we found that CLEC3A specifically binds to plasminogen and enhances tPA-mediated plasminogen activation. In summary, we have determined the structure, tissue distribution, and molecular function of the cartilage-specific lectin CLEC3A and show that CLEC3A binds to plasminogen and participates in tPA-mediated plasminogen activation.

The second exon encodes 27 amino acids and the third a CRD domain of 130 amino acids.

In this study, we used mouse CLEC3A for structural characterization of CLEC3A, and human CLEC3A for functional studies. We recombinantly expressed murine and human full-length CLEC3A as well as truncated forms comprising the potential α-helical oligomerization domain (OD) and the CRD (CLEC3A-Ex23) or only the CRD (CLEC3A-Ex3) in HEK-293 EBNA cells and generated specific antisera. We analyzed the structure of murine CLEC3A by a variety of biochemical and biophysical methods and compared the properties of the recombinant protein with those of CLEC3A extracted from cartilage. Further, we investigated its tissue distribution and extracellular assembly by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Finally, we studied the interaction of human CLEC3A and plasminogen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assay (ELISA-style binding assay) and by surface plasmon resonance and analyzed the tPA-mediated activation of plasminogen in the presence of human CLEC3A by plasminogen conversion assay. cDNAs encoding human and murine full-length CLEC3A (CLEC3A-flc) as well as truncated forms comprising the OD and CRD (CLEC3A-Ex23), or only the CRD (CLEC3A-Ex3) were cloned into modified pCEP-Pu vectors utilizing either the BM40 signal peptide (10Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. Properties of the extracellular calcium binding module of the proteoglycan testican.FEBS Lett. 1997; 414 (9323035): 557-56110.1016/S0014-5793(97)01070-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or the endogenous CLEC3A signal peptide. The recombinant vectors were used to transfect HEK-293 EBNA cells. Interestingly, only the vector containing the endogenous CLEC3A signal peptide yielded an appropriate protein expression of full-length CLEC3A, whereas those containing the BM40 signal peptide gave very low secretion. Transfection of CLEC3A-Ex3 carrying the BM40 signal peptide gave adequate secretion. The identity of recombinant murine full-length CLEC3A and CLEC3A-Ex3 was verified by peptide mass fingerprint analysis (not shown). Murine CLEC3A-Ex3 and human full-length CLEC3A were used to immunize a rabbit. The resulting antisera were Affinity-purified by binding to a column coupled with human full-length CLEC3A or murine CLEC3A-Ex3. In immunoblot analysis the eluted antibodies reacted strongly with CLEC3A and not with tetranectin (Fig. S1). We used recombinant mouse CLEC3A for structural characterization and recombinant human CLEC3A for functional studies. Recombinant mouse and human full-length CLEC3A as well as truncated forms of mouse and human CLEC3A were purified, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 2, A, B, F, and G). Under nonreducing conditions full-length CLEC3A (Fig. 2, A and G) mainly migrates as distinct bands with a molecular mass of ∼20–25 kDa, in good agreement with the calculated mass of 23.4 kDa for mouse and human CLEC3A. This shows that mouse and human CLEC3A occur mainly as monomers under denaturing conditions. After reduction of recombinant CLEC3A additional bands appeared below 20 kDa (Fig. 2A), presumably representing proteolytic fragments released upon cleavage of intrachain disulfide bonds. Interestingly, Coomassie Blue staining of mouse full-length CLEC3A revealed an additional diffuse band migrating between 35 and 100 kDa (Fig. 2A). By sequence analysis of mouse CLEC3A (www.expasy.org) 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. we could identify two potential O-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1A) at positions Ser-25 and Ser-33. Upon treatment of mouse CLEC3A with chondroitinase ABC the diffuse band largely disappeared, demonstrating substitution with chondroitin and/or dermatan sulfate, and an additional band was detected at 46 kDa, which may represent dimeric CLEC3A (Fig. 2C). Extracts of cartilage from forelegs and ribs of a newborn mouse and from the tail of a 2-year-old mouse were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2D). Mouse tissue–derived CLEC3A migrates as a distinct band at 20 kDa, showing that also tissue-derived CLEC3A occurs mainly as a monomer in SDS-PAGE. Further, a weak band with a mass of about 38 kDa was detected, possibly representing dimeric CLEC3A. In contrast with recombinant mouse CLEC3A, we did not find evidence for glycosylation of tissue-derived CLEC3A (Fig. 2D). In addition, we analyzed sequential extracts from human osteoarthritic cartilage (Fig. 2E). We found the highest amounts of CLEC3A in extracts obtained with 2 m urea. Also in human cartilage CLEC3A occurs mainly as a monomer. Furthermore, a minor amount of dimeric CLEC3A as well as proteolytic cleavage products was detected (Fig. 2E). Recombinant mouse CLEC3A was submitted to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with or without prior reduction (Fig. 3). Under nonreducing conditions, a major molecule ion peak was detected at 21.9 kDa, representing the CLEC3A monomer, and a second very faint peak at 44.6 kDa, probably originating from dimers. The calculated mass of full-length mouse CLEC3A is 23.4 kDa and the lower mass indicates that the protein is proteolytically processed. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis gave evidence for a processing at the N terminus (not shown). Similar processing at the positively charged N-terminal end was seen for matrilin-3 that had been recombinantly expressed in HEK-293 EBNA cells (11Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Molecular structure and tissue distribution of matrilin-3, a filament-forming extracellular matrix protein expressed during skeletal development.J. Biol.

Analysis of CLEC3A-Ex3 showed that it is not cleaved at either the N or the C terminus. Reduced full-length CLEC3A yielded additional molecule ion peaks with masses between 10 and 17 kDa, in accordance with the immunoblotting results. We characterized the oligomeric state of mouse CLEC3A, CLEC3A-Ex3, and CLEC3A-Ex2 by calibrated size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4A). Full-length CLEC3A eluted in a broad manner at positions corresponding to molecular masses ranging from more than 756 kDa to less than 43 kDa. This indicates that full-length CLEC3A forms higher order complexes under native conditions. Such complexes were also seen in electron microscopy. 4M. Mörgelin, personal communication. Some complex formation could also be detected in agarose-acrylamide composite (12Gebauer J.M. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Structure, evolution and expression of collagen XXVIII: Lessons from the zebrafish.Matrix Biol. 2016; 49 (26235539): 106-11910.1016/j.matbio.2015.07.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) native gels separating very large protein complexes and in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. S2, A and B). CLEC3A-Ex3 eluted close to the total volume of the size-exclusion column, which reflects that this protein lacks the potential coiled-coil oligomerization domain. The 29 amino acid–long synthetic peptide CLEC3A-Ex2 with a calculated mass of 3387 Da also eluted close to the total volume. The secondary structure of recombinant murine full-length CLEC3A, CLEC3A-Ex3, and CLEC3A-Ex2 was analyzed by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3B). The CLEC3A spectra indicated a structurally intact protein with about 90% α-helical conformation and some β-turns or disordered structures, and also the spectra of CLEC3A-Ex3 showed mainly an α-helical structure. The spectra for CLEC3A-Ex2 showed clear minima at 207 nm and 227 nm, characteristic for an α-helix (about 87%). Indeed, the second exon codes for 3.5 heptad repeats of 27 amino acids’ residues (2Neame P.J. Tapp H. Grimm D.R. The cartilage-derived, C-type lectin (CLECSF1): Structure of the gene and chromosomal location.Biochim. Biophys.

We also investigated the oligomeric structure of mouse full-length CLEC3A by electron microscopy (Fig. 5). The stained particles were heterogeneous in size and although monomers predominated, dimers and trimers also could be observed. At higher magnification the monomeric molecules show a globular domain, that most likely represents the CRD (exon 3), and a filamentous tail domain, probably representing the N-terminal part (exon 1) and the putative coiled-coil domain (exon 2). Dimers and trimers are joined at a single point via the filamentous domain, reminiscent of the structures seen for some oligomeric proteins held together by a coiled-coil, e.g. the matrilins (11Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Molecular structure and tissue distribution of matrilin-3, a filament-forming extracellular matrix protein expressed during skeletal development.J. Biol.

When investigating the tissue distribution of CLEC3A by extraction of mouse tissues followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting we could only detect the protein in cartilage (Fig. 2D). By immunohistochemistry on a section of a 14.25-day-old mouse embryo, CLEC3A could be seen in the primordial skeleton, e.g. in the vertebrae and ribs, in the cartilage primordium of the legs, and in the hyoid bone of the tongue (Fig. 6A). In the head of a newborn mouse, CLEC3A was present in the developing occipital bones and in cartilages of the nasal cavity (Fig. 6B). Also after birth, strong expression of CLEC3A could be detected only in cartilage. In knee joint cartilage of a newborn mouse, CLEC3A was present in the resting, proliferating, and hypertrophic zones of the growth plate (Fig. 6C). The staining was more prominent in the territorial matrix, but also seen in the interterritorial matrix. Close to the surface of the developing articular cartilage the signal was faint. CLEC3A was also detected in the cartilage remnants of growing bones, in costal and sternal cartilage, and in the cartilage plates of the sternum (Fig. 6D). The extracellular assembly of CLEC3A was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy of the extracellular matrix formed by Swarm rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells (Fig. 6, E and F). Here CLEC3A was part of an extensive extracellular network, reminiscent of the network staining seen for matrilin-3 (11Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Molecular structure and tissue distribution of matrilin-3, a filament-forming extracellular matrix protein expressed during skeletal development.J. Biol.

Three specific amino acid residues that are involved in binding of tetranectin to plasminogen are conserved in CLEC3A (Fig. 1). By SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis we found evidence for plasminogen/plasmin in cartilage extracts (not shown). We therefore investigated a potential CLEC3A-plasminogen interaction by ELISA-style binding assay (Fig. 7A). Human full-length CLEC3A was coated on a 96-well plate and after incubation with serial dilutions of plasminogen, bound plasminogen was detected with a polyclonal antibody. A concentration-dependent binding of plasminogen to human full-length CLEC3A was seen which did not, however, reach saturation (Fig. 7A). We further studied the binding of CLEC3A to plasminogen by surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 7B). Plasminogen was immobilized on a sensor chip and serial dilutions of human full-length CLEC3A (0.315–5 μm) were passed over the chip. The results showed a concentration-dependent binding of human full-length CLEC3A to plasminogen (KD 230 nm) (Fig. 7B). To determine whether CLEC3A is involved in tPA-mediated plasminogen activation, we assessed the ability of human tPA to convert human plasminogen to plasmin and measured the hydrolysis of the substrate S-2251 (H-D-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA) by plasmin in the presence of human full-length and truncated CLEC3A (Fig. 8A) at different concentrations (Fig. S3). Both full-length CLEC3A and to a lesser extent CLEC3A-Ex23 enhanced tPA-mediated plasminogen activation. The enzymatic activity detected in the presence of the various proteins was full-length CLEC3A, 52 units/liter; CLEC3A-Ex23, 31 units/liter; CLEC3A-Ex3, 10 units/liter; CLEC3A-Ex12, 7 units/liter; and BSA, 7 units/liter. We incubated human full-length CLEC3A with tPA in the presence or absence of plasminogen for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, cleavage of CLEC3A was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. After 30-min incubation of CLEC3A with tPA and plasminogen, CLEC3A could no longer be detected, which shows that CLEC3A is a plasmin substrate (Fig. 8B). We investigated the structure, tissue distribution, and extracellular assembly of CLEC3A, and its role in tPA-mediated plasminogen activation. CLEC3A mainly occurs as a monomer but can also form oligomers, presumably via a coiled-coil α-helix. Tetranectin has been shown to form non-covalent homotrimers (13Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Clemmensen I. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Tetranectin, a trimeric plasminogen-binding C-type lectin.Protein Sci. 1997; 6 (9232652): 1511-151510.1002/pro.5560060715Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The genes encoding murine CLEC3A and tetranectin are orthologous and their amino acid sequence is 42% identical (Fig. 1). The mouse CLEC3A gene consists of three exons and the second exon codes for 3.5 heptad repeats with a length of 27 amino acids (2Neame P.J. Tapp H. Grimm D.R. The cartilage-derived, C-type lectin (CLECSF1): Structure of the gene and chromosomal location.Biochim. Biophys.

However, the coiled coil of CLEC3A was predicted to be rather unstable, which is reflected in the rather low abundance of oligomers detected. A reason for this could be the relatively short heptad repeat region. By database analysis, it was predicted that at least four to five heptad repeats are necessary to form a stable coiled-coil domain (14Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Predicting coiled coils from protein sequences.Science. 1991; 252 (2031185): 1162-116410.1126/science.252.5009.1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tetranectin is known to form a trimeric α-helical coiled coil (15Nielsen B.B. Kastrup J.S. Rasmussen H. Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Larsen I.K. Crystal structure of tetranectin, a trimeric plasminogen-binding protein with an alpha-helical coiled coil.FEBS Lett. 1997; 412 (9256258): 388-39610.1016/S0014-5793(97)00664-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) although the amino acid residues in the “a” and “d” positions of the heptad repeat are mostly identical of those in CLEC3A (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, CLEC3A possesses six cysteine residues within the CRD domain that is encoded by CLEC3A exon 3. Cysteines frequently form disulfide bridges to stabilize the structure of multimeric proteins that are assembled via a coiled-coil domain, e.g. in matrilin 1 (16Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Hofer U. Chen Q. Goetinck P.F. The role of coiled-coil alpha-helices and disulfide bonds in the assembly and stabilization of cartilage matrix protein subunits—a mutational analysis.J. Biol.

However, for CLEC3A it has been predicted that the six cysteine residues within the CRD will form intrachain instead of interchain disulfide bridges, and stabilize the structure of the CRD rather than bridging CLEC3A subunits (2Neame P.J. Tapp H. Grimm D.R. The cartilage-derived, C-type lectin (CLECSF1): Structure of the gene and chromosomal location.Biochim. Biophys.

We found a distinct sharp band for CLEC3A in SDS-PAGE, but in addition a higher, diffuse band was seen as is often the case for highly glycosylated proteins such as proteoglycans and mucins. Tetranectin is not N-glycosylated but by mass spectrometry, a heterogeneous O-glycosylation was detected (17Jaquinod M. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Clemmensen I. Thøgersen H.C. Roepstorff P.

https://openalex.org/W2572480082,"The single-particle spectral function measures the density of electronic states (DOS) in a material as a function of both momentum and energy, providing central insights into phenomena such as superconductivity and Mott insulators. While scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and other tunneling methods have provided partial spectral information, until now only angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has permitted a comprehensive determination of the spectral function of materials in both momentum and energy. However, ARPES operates only on electronic systems at the material surface and cannot work in the presence of applied magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate a new method for determining the full momentum and energy resolved electronic spectral function of a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system embedded in a semiconductor. In contrast with ARPES, the technique remains operational in the presence of large externally applied magnetic fields and functions for electronic systems with zero electrical conductivity or with zero electron density. It provides a direct high-resolution and high-fidelity probe of the dispersion and dynamics of the interacting 2D electron system. By ensuring the system of interest remains under equilibrium conditions, we uncover delicate signatures of many-body effects involving electron-phonon interactions, plasmons, polarons, and a novel phonon analog of the vacuum Rabi splitting in atomic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2769575361,"Objective Our aim was to identify the impact of different surgical strategies on the incidence of C5 palsy. Background Degenerative cervical spinal stenosis is a steadily increasing morbidity in the ageing population. Postoperative C5 nerve root palsy is a common complication with severe impact on the patients´ quality of life. Methods We identified 1708 consecutive patients who underwent cervical decompression surgery due to degenerative changes. The incidence of C5 palsy and surgical parameters including type and level of surgery were recorded to identify predictors for C5 nerve palsy. Results The overall C5 palsy rate was 4.8%, with 18.3% of cases being bilateral. For ACDF alone the palsy rate was low (1.13%), compared to 14.0% of C5 palsy rate after corpectomy. The risk increased with extension of the procedures. Hybrid constructs with corpectomy plus ACDF at C3-6 showed significantly lower rates of C5 palsy (10.7%) than corpectomy of two vertebrae (p = 0.005). Multiple regression analysis identified corpectomy of C4 or C5 as a significant predictor. We observed a lower overall incidence for ventral (4.3%) compared to dorsal (10.9%) approaches (p<0.001). When imaging detected a postoperative shift of the spinal cord at index segment C4/5, palsy rate increased significantly (33.3% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.034). Conclusions Extended surgical strategies, such as dorsal laminectomies, multilevel corpectomies and procedures with extensive spinal cord shift were shown to display a high risk of C5 palsy. The use of extended procedures should therefore be employed cautiously. Switching to combined surgical methods like ACDF plus corpectomy can reduce the rate of C5 palsy."
https://openalex.org/W2768206372,"Prostate cancer research is hampered by the lack of in vivo preclinical models that accurately reflect patient tumour biology and the clinical heterogeneity of human prostate cancer. To overcome these limitations we propagated and characterised a new collection of patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts. Tumour fragments from 147 unsupervised, surgical prostate samples were implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient Rag2-/-γC-/- mice within 24 hours of surgery. Histologic and molecular characterisation of xenografts was compared with patient characteristics, including androgen-deprivation therapy, and exome sequencing. Xenografts were established from 47 of 147 (32%) implanted primary prostate cancers. Only 14% passaged successfully resulting in 20 stable lines; derived from 20 independent patient samples. Surprisingly, only three of the 20 lines (15%) were confirmed as prostate cancer; one line comprised of mouse stroma, and 16 were verified as human donor-derived lymphoid neoplasms. PCR for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) nuclear antigen, together with exome sequencing revealed that the lymphomas were exclusively EBV-associated. Genomic analysis determined that 14 of the 16 EBV+ lines had unique monoclonal or oligoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements, confirming their B-cell origin. We conclude that the generation of xenografts from tumour fragments can commonly result in B-cell lymphoma from patients carrying latent EBV. We recommend routine screening, of primary outgrowths, for latent EBV to avoid this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2768415615,"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative pathogen that causes food-borne gastroenteritis. A major virulence determinant of the organism is a type III secretion system (T3SS2) encoded on a pathogenicity island, Vp-PAI. Vp-PAI gene expression is regulated by two transcriptional regulators, VtrA and VtrB, whose N-terminal regions share homology with an OmpR-family DNA-binding domain. VtrA activates the gene expression of VtrB, which in turn activates Vp-PAI gene expression; however, the mechanism of this transcriptional activation by VtrA is not well understood. In this study, we determined that VtrA is a membrane protein with a transmembrane (TM) domain, which was required for its transcriptional regulatory activity. Although the N-terminal region of VtrA alone is insufficient for its transcriptional regulatory activity, forced oligomerization using the leucine-zipper dimerization domain of yeast GCN4 conferred transcriptional regulatory activity and a greater affinity for the promoter region of vtrB. A ToxR-based assay demonstrated that VtrA oligomerizes in vivo. We also showed that bile, a host-derived activator of VtrA, induces the oligomerization of VtrA, which requires the C-terminal domain. The promoter region of vtrB contained repetitive T-rich DNA elements, which are important for vtrB transcriptional activation and are conserved among T3SS2-possessing Vibrio species. These findings propose that VtrA is active as oligomers, which may facilitate its N-terminus binding the target DNA, thus enhancing its transcriptional regulatory activity."
https://openalex.org/W2768631056,"The performance of the Sha-he wastewater reclamation plant was evaluated in this study. To remove residual nitrogen after Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic (A2O) treatment, three multistage Anoxic-Oxic (A/O) were added to investigate the nitrogen removal efficiency and its mechanism. In addition, the constituents and evolution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during wastewater reclamation was also investigated using a method combining fluorescence spectroscopy with fluorescence regional integration (FRI). The results suggested that multistage A/O treatment can effectively improve the nitrogen removal ability under low concentrations of carbon sources. The total nitrogen (TN) exhibits significantly positive correlation with fulvic acid-like materials and humic acid-like materials. The correlation coefficient for TN and fulvic acid-like substances (R2 = 0.810, P < 0.01) removal was greater than that of humic acid-like substances (R2 = 0.636, P < 0.05). The results indicate that nitrogen removal may be achieved with the fulvic-like and humic-like substances, and the removal effects were higher by fulvic acid-like substances than humic-like substances, mostly due to that the latter were relatively more difficult to be utilized as carbon source during the nitrogen removal process. The effluent water quality of biological treatment reached the first grade A standard of “Cities sewage treatment plant pollutant discharge standard” (GB18918-2002). In addition, the effluent from the membrane bioreactor reached the “Standards of reclaimed water quality” (SL368-2006)."
https://openalex.org/W2770176207,"One of the leading causes of death is out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with an in-hospital mortality of about 70%. To identify predictors for the high mortality of OHCA patients and especially for women, that are considered at high risk for in-hospital mortality, we evaluated one specific setting of in-hospital treatment after OHCA: the emergency department (ED).Retrospective analysis of consecutive ED admissions with OHCA at the Inselspital Bern, Switzerland from 1st June 2012 to 31th Mai 2015. Demographic, preclinical and ED medical data were compared for patient groups with return of circulation (ROSC) and on-going resuscitation (CPR) on admission, as well as for subgroups with and without ED mortality. Predictors for ED mortality were investigated using univariate analysis with logistic regression.In 354 patients (228 (64.4%) with ROSC; 126 (35.6%) with on-going CPR) we found an overall ED mortality of 28.5% (5.7% ROSC group; 69.8% on-going CPR group). Female gender (OR 7.053 (CI 95% 2.085; 24.853), p = 0.002) and greater age (OR 1.052 (95% CI 1.006-1.101), p = 0.029) were associated with ED mortality in the ROSC but not in the on-going CPR group. Ventricular fibrillation as initially monitored rhythm (OR 0.126 (95% CI 0.027-0.582), p = 0.008) and shorter CPR duration (OR 1.055 (95% CI 1.024;1.088), p = 0.001) were associated with ED survival in patients with ROSC but not in patients with on-going CPR on admission. In ROSC patients a higher lactate and lower pH were associated with mortality (pH: OR 0.009 (CI95% 0.000;0.420), p = 0.016; lactate: OR 1.183 (95% CI 1.037; 1.349), p = 0.013); similar in on-going CPR patients (pH 0.061 (95% CI 0.007, 0.558), p = 0.013, lactate: 1.146 (95% CI 1.041;1.261), p = 0.005).Patients with ROSC who died during ED care were predominantly women and older patients, as well as patients with non-shockable initial heart rhythm and long CPR durations. In patients with on-going CPR on admission, no clinical or demographic predictors for ED mortality were found. Higher lactate and lower pH were predictors in both OHCA groups."
https://openalex.org/W2769717718,"Introduction The ablation gaps have been known as the main mechanism of recurrence as atrial tachycardia (AT) rather than atrial fibrillation (AF) after AF catheter ablation. However, AF organization due to reduction of critical mass or focal trigger may also be the mechanism of AT recurrence. We sought to find out the main clinical factors of recurrence as AT rather than AF after AF ablation in the absence of antiarrhythmic drug effect. Methods We analyzed 521 patients (70.8% men, 64.1% paroxysmal AF) who experienced AT or AF recurrence without antiarrhythmic drug effect during 44.7 ± 25.4 months follow-up. Results Among 521 patients with recurrence, 42.0% (219 of 521) recurred with AT. The proportion of AT recurrence was not different between the pulmonary vein isolation only group and additional linear ablation group (45.1% vs. 38.1%, p = 0.128). The absence of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29–0.83, p = 0.007), small left atrial (LA) volume index (OR 0.89 per 10 mL/m2, 95% CI 0.79–1.00, p = 0.049), and high mean LA bipolar voltage (OR 2.03 per 1 mV, 95% CI 1.30–3.16, p = 0.002) were independently associated with AT recurrence, whereas additional linear ablation was not. Among 90 patients who underwent repeat ablation procedure, rates of PV reconnection (p = 0.358) and gap in prior linear ablations (p = 0.269) were not significantly different between AT recurrence group and AF recurrence group. Conclusion The degree of LA remodeling is significantly associated with recurrence as AT after AF ablation, irrespective of potential ablation gap in linear lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2768455291,"The 2-methylcitric acid cycle (2-MCC) is a common route of propionate catabolism in microorganisms. In Salmonella enterica, the prpBCDE operon encodes most of the 2-MCC enzymes. In other organisms, e.g., Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, two genes, acnD and prpF replace prpD, which encodes 2-methylcitrate dehydratase. We showed that together, S. oneidensis AcnD and PrpF (SoAcnD, SoPrpF) compensated for the absence of PrpD in a S. enterica prpD strain. We also showed that SoAcnD had 2-methylcitrate dehydratase activity and that PrpF has aconitate isomerase activity. Here we report in vitro evidence that the product of the SoAcnD reaction is an isomer of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate (2-MCA], the product of the SePrpD reaction. We show that the SoPrpF protein isomerizes the product of the AcnD reaction into the PrpD product (2-MCA], a known substrate of the housekeeping aconitase (AcnB]. Given that SoPrpF is an isomerase, that SoAcnD is a dehydratase, and the results from in vivo and in vitro experiments reported here, it is likely that 4-methylaconitate is the product of the AcnD enzyme. Results from in vivo studies using a S. enterica prpD strain show that SoPrpF variants with substitutions of residues K73 or C107 failed to support growth with propionate as the sole source of carbon and energy. High-resolution (1.22 Å) three-dimensional crystal structures of PrpFK73E in complex with trans-aconitate or malonate provide insights into the mechanism of catalysis of the wild-type protein."
https://openalex.org/W2768614355,"This study was designed to assess unique baseline factors associated with subsequent hospitalizations in a cohort of outpatients with cirrhosis. A cohort of 193 patients with cirrhosis was recruited from an outpatient liver disease clinic at a single, tertiary medical center. Comorbidities, prescription medications, liver disease symptoms and severity, and psychiatric and pain symptoms were assessed at baseline using validated instruments. Inflammatory markers were measured using standardized Luminex assays. Subsequent hospitalizations and the primary admission diagnoses were collected via chart review. Multivariable models were used to evaluate which baseline factors were associated with time to hospitalization and number of hospitalizations. The cohort consisted of 193 outpatients, with an average age of 58±9 and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 12±5. Over follow-up, 57 (30%) were admitted to the hospital. The factors associated with time to hospitalization included the severity of liver disease (HR/MELD point:1.10, 95% CI:1.04,1.16), ascites (HR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.01, 3.58), baseline symptoms of depression (HR:2.34, 95% CI:1.28,4.25), sleep medications (HR:1.81, 95% CI:1.01, 3.22) and IL-6 (HR:1.43, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.84). Similarly the number admissions was significantly associated with MELD (IIR: 1.08, CI: 1.07,1.09), ascites (IIR: 4.15, CI:3.89, 4.43), depressive symptoms (IIR:1.54, CI:1.44,1.64), IL-6 (IIR:1.26, CI:1.23,1.30), sleep medications (IIR:2.74, CI:2.57, 2.93), and widespread pain (IIR: 1.61, CI: 1.50, 1.73). In conclusion, consistent with prior studies, MELD and ascites were associated with subsequent hospitalization. However, this study also identified other factors associated with hospitalization including inflammation, depressive symptoms, sleep medication use, and pain."

Although female sex is a well-known risk factor for the development of UTI after RTx, the role of the donor sex in this context remains unclear.In this case control study 6,763 RTx cases were screened for UTI when presenting at our transplant outpatient clinics. 102 different RTx patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared to 102 controls. Data on renal function was prospectively followed for 12 months. Results were compared to a previous RTx cohort from our transplant center. Additionally, we assessed the immunological response of leukocytes from 58 kidney recipients and 16 controls to lipopolysaccharide stimulation.After identification by univariate analysis, multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated female sex, minor height, advanced age and male kidney allograft sex to be associated with the occurrence of UTI after RTx. Female recipients who received male grafts had the best renal function 12 months after presentation. However, leukocyte response of recipients to lipopolysaccharide was impaired irrespective of donor and recipient sex to the same extend.We conclude from our data that male kidney allografts are associated with the occurrence of UTI after RTx but did not influence the response of leukocytes to lipopolysaccharide.

The use of alternative approaches in rubella serology could add new information leading to a fuller understanding of rubella protective immunity and neutralizing antibody response after vaccination.We applied microarray technology to measure antibodies to all rubella virus proteins in 75 high and 75 low rubella virus-specific antibody responders after two MMR vaccine doses. These data were used in multivariate penalized logistic regression modeling of rubella-specific neutralizing antibody response after vaccination.We measured antibodies to all rubella virus structural proteins (i.e., the glycoproteins E1 and E2 and the capsid C protein) and to the non-structural protein P150. Antibody levels to each of these proteins were: correlated with the neutralizing antibody titer (p<0.006); demonstrated differences between the high and the low antibody responder groups (p<0.008); and were components of the model associated with/predictive of vaccine-induced rubella virus-specific neutralizing antibody titers (misclassification error = 0.2).Our study supports the use of this new technology, as well as the use of antibody profiles/patterns (rather than single antibody measures) as biomarkers of neutralizing antibody response and correlates of protective immunity in rubella virus serology."

The THBD c.1611C>A (p.Cys537X) mutation in heterozygous state was found in the propositus. This mutation leads to the synthesis of a truncated TM which has lost the last three amino-acids of the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail.We investigated the mechanism responsible for TM shedding in endothelial cells with THBD c.1611C>A mutation.Complementary DNA of TM wild type (TM-WT) was incorporated into a pcDNA3.1 vector for transient transfection in COS-1 cells. Mutagenesis was performed to create the c.1611C<A (TM1-536) mutant and 4 other TM mutants (TM1-515, TM1-525, TM1-533 and TM1-537) with a transmembrane domain having different lengths. The effect of shear stress, metalloprotease inhibitor, certain proteases and reducing agents were tested on TM shedding.Western blot and immunofluorescent analysis showed that TM1-536 was produced and a certain amount of TM1-536 was anchored on the cell membrane. A significantly higher levels of soluble TM was observed in the TM1-536 cell medium in comparison with TM-WT (56.3 +/- 5.2 vs 8.8 +/- 1.6 ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.001). The shedding of TM1-536 was 75% decreased in cells cultured in the presence of a metalloprotease inhibitor. No difference was observed between TM1-536 and TM-WT shedding after cell exposure to cathepsin G, elastase, several reducing agents and high shear stress (5000 s-1). Significantly higher levels of soluble TM were observed in the cell media of TM1-533, TM1-525, TM1-515 in comparison with TM-WT (p < 0.05).The mechanism responsible for TM shedding is complex and is not completely understood: higher sensitivity of the TM1-536 to the proteolysis by metalloproteases and a defect of synthesis due to the decreased size of the transmembrane domain might explain the high levels of soluble TM in plasma of the carriers."

https://openalex.org/W2769438454,"Dry cough is a common symptom described in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and impairs quality of life. The exact mechanisms causing cough in IPF remain unclear, however evidence suggests altered cough neurophysiology and sensitisation plays a role; IPF patients have an enhanced cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin. The Transient Receptor Potential Vanniloid-1 channel (TRPV-1) has a role in the cough reflex and airway expression is increased in patients with chronic cough. The Ankyrin-1 receptor (TRPA-1) is often co-expressed. It was hypothesised that, like chronic cough patients, IPF patients have increased airway TRP receptor expression. Bronchial biopsies were obtained from 16 patients with IPF, 11 patients with idiopathic chronic cough and 8 controls without cough. All other causes of cough were rigorously excluded. Real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to detect TRPV-1 and TRPA-1 mRNA expression with Immunohistochemistry demonstrating protein expression. Mean TRPV-1 and TRPA-1 gene expression was higher in IPF patients compared with controls, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Immunostaining supported these findings. This study suggests that structural up-regulation of central airway TRP receptors is not the key mechanism for cough in IPF patients. It is probable that IPF cough results from altered neuronal sensitivity at multiple levels of the cough pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2769554350,"Many solutes have been reported to remain at higher plasma levels relative to normal than the standard index solute urea in hemodialysis patients. Untargeted mass spectrometry was employed to compare solute levels in plasma and plasma ultrafiltrate of hemodialysis patients and normal subjects. Quantitative assays were employed to check the accuracy of untargeted results for selected solutes and additional measurements were made in dialysate and urine to estimate solute clearances and production. Comparison of peak areas indicated that many solutes accumulated to high levels in hemodialysis patients, with average peak areas in plasma ultrafiltrate of dialysis patients being more than 100 times greater than those in normals for 123 features. Most of these mass spectrometric features were identified only by their mass values. Untargeted analysis correctly ranked the accumulation of 5 solutes which were quantitatively assayed but tended to overestimate its extent. Mathematical modeling showed that the elevation of plasma levels for these solutes could be accounted for by a low dialytic to native kidney clearance ratio and a high dialytic clearance relative to the volume of the accessible compartment. Numerous solutes accumulate to high levels in hemodialysis patients because dialysis does not replicate the clearance provided by the native kidney. Many of these solutes remain to be chemically identified and their pathogenic potential elucidated."

The first examined the light measurement characteristics of the LS when used with a portable PSG device, specifically recording trace range, linearity, sensitivity, and stability. This involved the LS being exposed to varying incandescent and fluorescent light levels in a light controlled room. Secondly, the LS was trialled in 24 home and 12 hospital ambulatory PSGs to investigate whether light levels in home and hospital settings were within the recording range of the LS, and to quantify the typical light intensity reduction at the time of Loff. A preliminary exploration of clinical utility was also conducted. Linearity between LS voltage and lux was demonstrated, and the LS trace was stable over 14 hours of recording. The observed maximum voltage output of the LS/PSG device was 250 mV, corresponding to a maximum recording range of 350 lux and 523 lux for incandescent and fluorescent light respectively. At the time of Loff, light levels were within the recording range of the LS, and on average dropped by 72 lux (9-245) in the home and 76 lux (4-348) in the hospital setting. Results suggest that clinical utility was greatest in hospital settings where patients are less mobile. The LS was a simple and effective objective marker of light level in portable PSG, which can be used to identify Loff in ambulatory PSG. This allows measurement of additional sleep indices and support with clinical decisions."
