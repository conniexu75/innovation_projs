In the course of experiments on the metabolism of hydroxyproline, it was observed that incubation of hydroxyproline with kidney pre.parations led to the formation of a compound which we have identified as pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (PCA) (7).’ Subsequent study revealed that kidney D-amino acid oxidase oxidizes hydroxy-n-proline and allohydroxy-n-proline to an intermediate compound which appears to be Al-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylic acid. The int’ermediate is spontaneously converted (at pH 8.3) to PCA; this conversion occurs much more rapidly in acid solution. PCA formation was also observed as a product of t,ransamination of y-hydroxyornithine with glyoxylate, pyruvate, or wketoglutarate. The evidence suggests that such transamination, in contrast to that of ornithine (8, 9), involves the a-amino group rather than the b-amino group. This report describes experiments on the formation of PCA by enzymatic oxidation, by enzymatic and non-enzymatic transamination, and also by non-enzymatic oxidation of hydroxyproline by hydrogen peroxide. Some implications of these findings in terms of the metabolism of hydroxyproline are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2027476000,PREVIOUS work has shown that ‘anorganic’ (ethylenediamine-extracted) bone can serve as a successful foundation for new osseous growth in long-bone defects of the dog1−3. The objective of this present study using nine rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys was to determine if the response of the oral tissues to osseous ‘anorganic’ heterografts was similar to that of the host tissue of the long bones. Eleven mandibular and five maxillary heterogeneous grafts were inserted into two types of osseous defects: (a) an ‘exodontic’ or alveolectomy defect produced by the extraction of the permanent molar and bicuspid teeth; (b) a deep ‘cystic’ type of bone cavity produced by the removal of unerupted molar and cuspid teeth.

Watson and Berg4, however, could not confirm Bimington's findings."

https://openalex.org/W4240985228,"IT has been shown that the free-radical content of tissue increases during metabolism1 and the possible importance of free-radical states in carcinogenesis has been discussed by many authors. In particular, it has been suggested that the free-radical state of carcinogens is stabilized as an ion2. The simplest way of producing an ion from a neutral molecule is by the addition or removal of an electron, the former being more likely in tissue owing to the low oxidation-reduction potential3."

We have observed that the most effective reserpine antagonists were those added as the free acids. These reduced the reaction of the bath–fluid to about pH 5. When the reaction was reduced to similar levels by the addition of small volumes of 0.2 N hydrochloric acid, antagonism to reserpine was also seen. This was less marked, however, than that following addition of the most effective metabolites, which included α-ketoglutaric acid (1 mgm. per ml.) and cis-aconitic acid anhydride (1 mgm. per ml.). At a bath pH of 7.4, no antagonism to reserpine was seen."
