T cell-inducing vaccines hold promise to exert long-lasting disease control in combination with CPI therapy. Safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of an individualized, heterologous chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd68) and self-amplifying mRNA (samRNA)-based neoantigen vaccine in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab were assessed as primary endpoints in an ongoing phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors (NCT03639714). The individualized vaccine regimen was safe and well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) >10% included pyrexia, fatigue, musculoskeletal and injection site pain and diarrhea. Serious TRAEs included one count each of pyrexia, duodenitis, increased transaminases and hyperthyroidism. The RP2D was 1012 viral particles (VP) ChAd68 and 30 µg samRNA. Secondary endpoints included immunogenicity, feasibility of manufacturing and overall survival (OS). Vaccine manufacturing was feasible, with vaccination inducing long-lasting neoantigen-specific CD8 T cell responses. Several patients with microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS-CRC) had improved OS. Exploratory biomarker analyses showed decreased circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with prolonged OS. Although small study size limits statistical and translational analyses, the increased OS observed in MSS-CRC warrants further exploration in larger randomized studies."

Locally advanced rectal cancer is still treated with neoadjuvant radiation, chemotherapy and surgery, but recent evidence suggests that patients with a complete response can avoid surgery permanently. To define correlates of response to neoadjuvant therapy, we analyzed genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 738 untreated rectal cancers. APC mutations were less frequent in the lower than in the middle and upper rectum, which could explain the more aggressive behavior of distal tumors. No somatic alterations had significant associations with response to neoadjuvant therapy in a treatment-agnostic manner, but KRAS mutations were associated with faster relapse in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by consolidative chemotherapy. Overexpression of IGF2 and L1CAM was associated with decreased response to neoadjuvant therapy. RNA-sequencing estimates of immune infiltration identified a subset of microsatellite-stable immune hot tumors with increased response and prolonged disease-free survival."

However, the role of educational level on validity and reliability of Baecke questionnaire is still not stablished, being a factor that can potentially influence the accuracy of self-reported measures. The present study aimed to verify the validity and reliability of Baecke questionnaire for the measurement of physical activity in community dwelling adults according to education level. The sample included 251 adults (42.4±17.0 years, 55% of women). Physical activity was self-reported by Baecke questionnaire and objectively measured by accelerometer. The education level (EL) was classified by years of study into low (<8 years), medium (8-11 years) and high (>11 years). A 7-day test-retest reliability was analyzed by intraclass correlation coefficient. The relationship, agreement and validity of the Baecke questionnaire against accelerometry were analyzed by Spearman's correlation, Kappa index, and ROC curve, respectively. The reliability of Baecke questionnaire were r = 0.97 (high EL), r = 0.78 (medium EL), and r = 0.68 (low EL). Sensitivity and specificity were 77% and 71% in high EL, 54% and 80% in medium EL and 33% and 89% in the low EL. Baecke questionnaire proved to be reliable and a valid measurement of habitual physical activity in adults with medium and high EL."
https://openalex.org/W4291110053,"Misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are retrotranslocated into the cytosol and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a pathway termed luminal ER-associated protein degradation. Retrotranslocation is mediated by a conserved protein complex, consisting of the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 and four associated proteins (Der1, Usa1, Hrd3, and Yos9). Photocrosslinking experiments provided preliminary evidence for the polypeptide path through the membrane but did not reveal specific interactions between amino acids in the substrate and Hrd1 complex. Here, we have used site-specific disulfide crosslinking to map the interactions of a glycosylated model substrate with the Hrd1 complex in live S. cerevisiae cells. Together with available electron cryo-microscopy structures, the results show that the substrate interacts on the luminal side with both a groove in Hrd3 and the lectin domain of Yos9 and inserts a loop into the membrane, with one side of the loop interacting with the lateral gate of Der1 and the other with the lateral gate of Hrd1. Our disulfide crosslinking experiments also show that two Hrd1 molecules can interact through their lateral gates and that Hrd1 autoubiquitination is required for the disassembly of these Hrd1 dimers. Taken together, these data define the path of a polypeptide through the ER membrane and suggest that autoubiquitination of inactive Hrd1 dimers is required to generate active Hrd1 monomers."

Recent study has shown that Alcaligenes ammonioxydans oxidizes ammonia to dinitrogen via a process featuring the intermediate hydroxylamine, termed “Dirammox” (direct ammonia oxidation). However, the unique biochemistry of this process remains unknown. Here, we report an enzyme involved in Dirammox that catalyzes the conversion of hydroxylamine to N2. We tested previously annotated proteins involved in redox reactions, DnfA, DnfB, and DnfC, to determine their ability to catalyze the oxidation of ammonia or hydroxylamine. Our results showed that none of these proteins bound to ammonia or catalyzed its oxidation; however, we did find DnfA bound to hydroxylamine. Further experiments demonstrated that, in the presence of NADH and FAD, DnfA catalyzed the conversion of 15N-labeled hydroxylamine to 15N2. This conversion did not happen under oxygen (O2)-free conditions. Thus, we concluded that DnfA encodes a hydroxylamine oxidase. We demonstrate that DnfA is not homologous to any known hydroxylamine oxidoreductases and contains a diiron center, which was shown to be involved in catalysis via electron paramagnetic resonance experiments. Furthermore, enzyme kinetics of DnfA were assayed, revealing a Km of 92.9 ± 3.0 μM for hydroxylamine and a kcat of 0.028 ± 0.001 s−1. Finally, we show that DnfA was localized in the cytoplasm and periplasm as well as in tubular membrane invaginations in HO-1 cells. To the best of our knowledge, we conclude that DnfA is the first enzyme discovered that catalyzes oxidation of hydroxylamine to N2.

Biological conversion of ammonia and oxidized nitrogen (i.e., nitrate, nitrite, nitrous and nitric oxides, hydroxylamine, and hydrazine) (Fig. 1A) plays an important role in natural nitrogen (N2) biogeochemical cycling (1Kuypers M.M.M. Marchant H.K. Kartal B. The microbial nitrogen-cycling network.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). N2 gas in the atmosphere, being the largest N2 reservoir, was recruited from various N2 compounds via the currently well-known microbial denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) (2Knowles R.

Denitrification and anammox play important role in natural N2 cycling. Yet, the importance of the Dirammox and the ANME remained to be evaluated. Except for Dirammox, the biochemistry, particularly the enzymes catalyzing dinitrogen-forming (DNF) reaction, had been identified or deduced (Fig. 1B).Hydroxylamine has been identified as a general intermediate from autotrophic or heterotrophic ammonia oxidizers (9Soler-Jofra A. Perez J. van Loosdrecht M.C.M. Hydroxylamine and the nitrogen cycle: a review.Water Res. 2021; 190116723Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The current understanding indicated that hydroxylamine was converted into NO (NO/N2O/NO2−) during ammonia oxidation, and the reactions were catalyzed by hydroxylamine oxidoreductases (HAOs) (10Yamanaka T.

Studies of the hydroxylamine metabolism of Nitrosomonas europaea. I. Purification of hydroxylamine oxidase.Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and anammoxers (14Schalk J. de Vries S. Kuenen J.G. Jetten M.S. Involvement of a novel hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in anaerobic ammonium oxidation.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5405-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The canonical HAO from AOB typically oxidizes hydroxylamine to nitrite (NO2−) (10Yamanaka T. Sakano Y. Oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite catalyzed by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase purified from Nitrosomonas-europaea.Curr. Microbiol. 1980; 4: 239-244Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Caranto and Lancaster (12Caranto J.D. Lancaster K.M. Nitric oxide is an obligate bacterial nitrification intermediate produced by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114: 8217-8222Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that NO, not NO2−, was the obligate product of hydroxylamine oxidation by HAO. The crystal structure of HAO is a homotrimer and each monomer of molecular weight 67.1 kDa and contains seven c-type hemes and a catalytic heme P460 as cofactor in the active site (15Igarashi N. Moriyama H. Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. Tanaka N. The 2.8 A structure of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase from a nitrifying chemoautotrophic bacterium, Nitrosomonas europaea.Nat. Struct.

Structural studies of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase reveal a unique heme cofactor and a previously unidentified interaction partner.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 6211-6218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AOB encode a cytochrome P460 (also known as CytL) that detoxifies hydroxylamine by oxidizing it to N2O with an unknown biological oxidant (17Caranto J.D. Vilbert A.C. Lancaster K.M. Nitrosomonas europaea cytochrome P460 is a direct link between nitrification and nitrous oxide emission.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113: 14704-14709Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly, the hydroxylamine oxidase (HOX) of the anaerobic ammonia oxidizer Kuenenia stuttgartienses detoxifies hydroxylamine to NO and thus generates substrate and electrons for respiration (18Maalcke W.J. Dietl A. Marritt S.J. Butt J.N. Jetten M.S. Keltjens J.T. et al.Structural basis of biological NO generation by octaheme oxidoreductases.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 1228-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Despite the low sequence identity (<30%), this HOX is related and shares structural similarities to the canonical HAOs, of which both HAOs and HOX are homotrimers and have c-type hemes and the P460-type catalytic centers (18Maalcke W.J. Dietl A. Marritt S.J. Butt J.N. Jetten M.S. Keltjens J.T. et al.Structural basis of biological NO generation by octaheme oxidoreductases.J. Biol.

The archaeal HAO is currently unknown, and no genes encoding ammonia-oxidizing bacteria-like homologs were found in archaeal genomes (19Vajrala N. Martens-Habbena W. Sayavedra-Soto L.A. Schauer A. Bottomley P.J. Stahl D.A. et al.Hydroxylamine as an intermediate in ammonia oxidation by globally abundant marine archaea.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, neither the HAOs nor other enzymes convert hydroxylamine and produce molecular N2 as product.Recently, Alcaligenes ammonioxydans HO-1 was found efficiently converting ammonia to N2 via a newly proposed pathway termed Dirammox (6Wu M.R. Hou T.T. Liu Y. Miao L.L. Ai G.M. Ma L. et al.Novel Alcaligenes ammonioxydans sp. nov. from wastewater treatment sludge oxidizes ammonia to N2 with a previously unknown pathway.Environ. Microbiol. 2021; 23: 6965-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A genetic cluster dnfABC was found to be essential for this N2 production with A. ammonioxydans. The genetic cluster dnfABC was deduced to encode enzymes that sequentially oxidized ammonia (or its derivatives) to hydroxylamine and to N2. In this study, we found that the one of the gene in this genetic cluster dnfABC, dnfA, encoded a HOX. Uniquely, this DnfA HOX catalyzed the oxidation of hydroxylamine to N2.ResultsBioinformatic analysis of translational products of dnfABC, purification, and catalytic activities of DnfA, DnfB, and DnfC from recombinant Escherichia coli cellsBased on our previous and recent bioinformatic analyses, the translational products of dnfA, dnfB, and dnfC were annotated as diiron oxygenase, NADH-dependent reductase, and glutamine amidotransferase, respectively. In silico analyses of DnfA, DnfB, and DnfC did not reveal transmembrane domains or secretion signals and thus most likely these proteins have a cytoplasmic localization (6Wu M.R. Hou T.T. Liu Y. Miao L.L. Ai G.M. Ma L. et al.Novel Alcaligenes ammonioxydans sp. nov. from wastewater treatment sludge oxidizes ammonia to N2 with a previously unknown pathway.Environ. Microbiol. 2021; 23: 6965-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). DnfA shared up to 28 to 30% sequence identities with the arylamine oxygenase CmlI of Streptomyces venezuelae (20Makris T.M. Vu V.V. Meier K.K. Komor A.J. Rivard B.S. Munck E. et al.An unusual peroxo intermediate of the arylamine oxygenase of the chloramphenicol biosynthetic pathway.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015; 137: 1608-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the AurF N-oxygenase from Streptomyces thioluteus (21Choi Y.S. Zhang H. Brunzelle J.S. Nair S.K. Zhao H.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6858-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and CmlI homologs (22Leipoldt F. Santos-Aberturas J. Stegmann D.P. Wolf F. Kulik A. Lacret R. et al.Warhead biosynthesis and the origin of structural diversity in hydroxamate metalloproteinase inhibitors.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) among those documented proteins, suggesting the possibility of DnfA involved in ammonia and/or hydroxylamine oxidation. A diiron motif in DnfA was predicted to consist of 3-His and four carboxylate (Aps/Glu) residues (residues Glu88, Glu123, His126, Glu182, His209, Glu213, and His216) and identical to those in AurF and CmlI (Fig. S1). DnfB was consisted of a FNR-like (ferredoxin reductase) domain that has FAD- and NAD(P)-binding sites and a 2Fe–2S iron–sulfur cluster–binding domain, suggesting its role in shuttling electrons. Since the genetic cluster dnfABC conferred E. coli cells, the ability to produce hydroxylamine and N2 from ammonia (6Wu M.R. Hou T.T. Liu Y. Miao L.L. Ai G.M. Ma L. et al.Novel Alcaligenes ammonioxydans sp. nov. from wastewater treatment sludge oxidizes ammonia to N2 with a previously unknown pathway.Environ. Microbiol. 2021; 23: 6965-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), first, we individually cloned and expressed dnfA, dnfB, and dnfC in E. coli, and the translation products DnfA, DnfB, and DnfC were purified (Fig. 2A). The purified DnfA, DnfB, and DnfC were tested for their interactions with ammonia and hydroxylamine. Results showed that none of them interacted with ammonia, but DnfA bound to hydroxylamine (Fig. 2, B and C). Next, we tested whether DnfA, DnfB, or DnfC was able to catalyze the conversion of ammonia and hydroxylamine. An in vitro reconstitution enzymatic activity assay using the chemical electron mediator FAD was performed following the previously reported method for the DnfA homolog AurF (21Choi Y.S. Zhang H. Brunzelle J.S. Nair S.K. Zhao H. In vitro reconstitution and crystal structure of p-aminobenzoate N-oxygenase (AurF) involved in aureothin biosynthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6858-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We found that neither DnfB nor DnfC catalyzed the conversion of hydroxylamine to N2, but DnfA alone did, in the presence of molecular oxygen (O2), FAD, and NADH (Fig. 2D). The combination of DnfA and DnfB or DnfC oxidized hydroxylamine to N2 with this in vitro assay systems, but the N2 production and hydroxylamine consumption were not significantly different from that of DnfA (Fig. 2D). These results indicated that DnfA alone was enough, in the presence of molecular O2, FAD, and NADH, for in vitro hydroxylamine oxidation, and that DnfB and DnfC were not necessary for the in vitro assay. Although a recent study showed that DnfB and DnfC were essential for Dirammox with strain JQ135 (23Xu S.Q. Qian X.X. Jiang Y.H. Qin Y.L. Zhang F.Y. Zhang K.Y. et al.Genetic Foundations of direct ammonia oxidation (Dirammox) to N2 and MocR-like transcriptional regulator DnfR in Alcaligenes faecalis strain JQ135.Appl. Environ.

Results showed that the consumption of approximate 2 mol of hydroxylamine produced 1 mol N2, suggesting stoichiometric formation of N2 from two hydroxylamine N2 atoms. Considering that hydroxylamine was completely converted to 15N-labeled N2 when DnfA was present but not so when DnfA was absent, we concluded that the DnfA-catalyzed reaction, rather than a nonenzymatic reaction, dominated the conversion of hydroxylamine. It was reported that chemical decomposition of hydroxylamine in soils produced N2 (24Bremner J.M. Blackmer A.M. Waring S.A. Formation of nitrous oxide and dinitrogen by chemical decomposition of hydroxylamine in soils.Soil Biol. Biochem. 1980; 12: 263-269Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A trace but detectable amount of N2 production was observed in the reaction system without DnfA. A possible explanation might be that O2 was activated by FAD/NADH and consequently triggered spontaneous reactions with yet unknown chemistry for N2 generation. But the amount of N2 production was much lower than the one observed from the DnfA-catalyzed conversion of hydroxylamine (Fig. 2D), indicating a major role of DnfA catalysis.DnfA single-turnover reaction and the involvement of molecular O2 during hydroxylamine oxidation into N2It has been reported that the CmlI and AurF, homologs of DnfA, could catalyze single-turnover reactions in the reduced form (20Makris T.M.

It was found that the production of 15N2 was quantitatively related to the amounts of DnfA, with a 15N2:DnfA ratio of 0.26:1 (0.26 N2 per diiron cluster). The result indicated that two DnfA molecules catalyzed the oxidization of one molecule of hydroxylamine in the single-turnover reaction. Indeed, we confirmed that native DnfA occurred as dimer with gel-filtration assay. This ratio of 0.26:1 was comparable to that per molecule of activated CmlI converted 0.35 equivalents of substrate (NH2-CAM) (20Makris T.M. Vu V.V. Meier K.K. Komor A.J. Rivard B.S.

DnfA concentrations were used at 15, 30, 60, and 120 nmol. B and C, the plots of N2 production velocity versus DnfA (B) and FAD (C) concentrations.

Experiments were performed with initial 10 18O2% + 90 He% in the head gas space, 10 mM 15NH2OH, 120 μM FAD, 10 mM NADH, and 330 μM DnfA. The data shown here are the differences of the tests with DnfA and without DnfA, and data are fitted into a linear equation. All tests were carried out in 0.3 ml reactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We determined reaction velocities at different DnfA concentrations and found that the N2 formation velocity was related to enzyme concentrations (Fig. 3B). We also determined reaction velocities at different FAD concentrations (0, 1, 10, 50, and 100 μM) with 10 μM DnfA, 1 mM NADH, and 1 mM 15NH2OH. Results demonstrated that higher FAD concentrations resulted in higher reaction velocities, and 100 μM FAD was appropriate to establish catalytic competence and low background under these enzyme and substrate concentrations (Fig. 3C). This mediator FAD concentration was similar with that used in other study (21Choi Y.S. Zhang H. Brunzelle J.S. Nair S.K. Zhao H. In vitro reconstitution and crystal structure of p-aminobenzoate N-oxygenase (AurF) involved in aureothin biosynthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6858-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that DnfA activity depended on molecular O2. By using 10 mM 15N-labeled hydroxylamine and 10% of 18O2 (90% of the gas phase is He), the consumption rate of hydroxylamine was determined to be 0.15 ± 0.02 μM/s per mg protein, and the production rates of 15N2 and H218O were 0.06 ± 0.01 μM/s per mg protein and 0.13 ± 0.01 μM/s per mg protein, respectively (Fig. 3D). Another indicted more very solid evidence for O2 involvement was that this reaction would not proceed in O2-free atmosphere. The molar ratio of hydroxylamine consumption to N2 production to H218O production was 2.26:1:1.96, a ratio close to the values in Equation 1. We calculated that this reaction is thermodynamically feasible, ΔGo’ = −587 kJ mol−1.Based on those results and data, we proposed that DnfA catalyzed the following reaction: (Equation 1).215NH2OH+O218+NADH+H+→N215+2H2O+2H2O18+NAD+(1) Kinetic constants of DnfAFurthermore, the kinetic constants of DnfA-catalyzed reactions at atmospheric condition were determined. Using FAD as the electron mediator, the Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) for hydroxylamine and the catalytic efficiency (kcat) were determined to be 92.9 ± 3.0 μM and 0.028 ± 0.001 s−1, respectively (Fig. 4). Though DnfA converted tlhe hydroxylamine with a relative low catalytic efficiency in vitro, the substrate-binding affinity and catalytic efficiency of DnfA are comparable with those reported for the DnfA homolog AurF (Km = 5.24 ± 0.64 μM and kcat = 0.10 ± 0.01 s−1). Therefore, hydroxylamine was deduced as the substrate of DnfA under physiological conditions. Moreover, the transcriptional level of DnfA responding to ammonia stimuli was high (6500 ± 400 TPM) and at least one order of magnitude higher than the other genes involved in N-metabolism (6Wu M.R. Hou T.T. Liu Y. Miao L.L. Ai G.M. Ma L. et al.Novel Alcaligenes ammonioxydans sp. nov. from wastewater treatment sludge oxidizes ammonia to N2 with a previously unknown pathway.Environ. Microbiol. 2021; 23: 6965-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This high transcriptional level could be a compensation for the low catalytic efficiency.Figure 4Determination of kinetic constants of DnfA under atmospheric condition. The assays were performed with 10 μM DnfA (0 for control assay), 100 μM FAD, 1 mM NADH, and 15 to 400 μM of NH2OH at atmospheric condition.

The absorption spectrum of DnfA revealed a typical protein feature with absorption at 280 nm (Fig. 5A). Usually, a featuring absorption at 300 to 340 nm was observed for binuclear nonheme iron-containing enzymes, which resulted from an oxo-to-Fe(III) charge transfer transition and could be bleached by the addition of reductant reagents (25Fox B.G.

The lack of absorption at 300 to 340 nm with DnfA, as well as H2O2-treated DnfA, suggested that the diiron center might occur as a μ-hydroxo-bridged diferric state instead of a μ-oxo one. In the presence of 1.0 M sodium azide (NaN3), a new absorption band of 450 nm was observed for DnfA (Fig. 5A). The new absorption band at 450 nm was observed for those enzymes containing diiron clusters in the presence of azide, such as 18:0-ACP delta-9-desaturase, CmlA, and hemerythrin (25Fox B.G.

The lack of absorption at 300 to 340 nm and the presence of azide-induced absorption at 450 nm distinguished the diiron center of DnfA with those previously reported diiron center enzymes.Figure 5Spectroscopic characterization of the diiron cluster in DnfA.

As shown in Figure 5B, the EPR spectrum of as-isolated DnfA (trace i) shows only minor impurities from manganese (IV) species but no signal for the diiron center. This is due to the fact that oxidized cluster [FeIII–FeIII] has strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two FeIII atoms and thus is diamagnetic (Stotal = 0) and EPR silent. Similar EPR spectrum was also observed for AurF in previous studies (28Simurdiak M. Lee J. Zhao H.

https://openalex.org/W4291908039,"Introduction Individuals with Long Covid represent a new and growing patient population. In England, fewer than 90 Long Covid clinics deliver assessment and treatment informed by NICE guidelines. However, a paucity of clinical trials or longitudinal cohort studies means that the epidemiology, clinical trajectory, healthcare utilisation and effectiveness of current Long Covid care are poorly documented, and that neither evidence-based treatments nor rehabilitation strategies exist. In addition, and in part due to pre-pandemic health inequalities, access to referral and care varies, and patient experience of the Long Covid care pathways can be poor. In a mixed methods study, we therefore aim to: (1) describe the usual healthcare, outcomes and resource utilisation of individuals with Long Covid; (2) assess the extent of inequalities in access to Long Covid care, and specifically to understand Long Covid patients’ experiences of stigma and discrimination. Methods and analysis A mixed methods study will address our aims. Qualitative data collection from patients and health professionals will be achieved through surveys, interviews and focus group discussions, to understand their experience and document the function of clinics. A patient cohort study will provide an understanding of outcomes and costs of care. Accessible data will be further analysed to understand the nature of Long Covid, and the care received. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from South Central—Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (reference 303958). The dissemination plan will be decided by the patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) group members and study Co-Is, but will target 1) policy makers, and those responsible for commissioning and delivering Long Covid services, 2) patients and the public, and 3) academics."
https://openalex.org/W4291109179,"Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a dismal prognosis. KDM1A (lysine demethylase 1A), overexpressed in multiple cancer types, is a lysine demethylase that targets both histone and nonhistone proteins. However, it is unclear how KDM1A expression affects HCC etiology. Here, we show that KDM1A can interact with and demethylate FKBP8 (FKBP prolyl isomerase 8), a cytoplasmic protein that regulates cell survival through the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma-2). We show that demethylation of FKBP8 enhances its ability to stabilize BCL2. Consistently, we observed positive correlation between KDM1A and BCL2 protein levels in liver cancer patients. Functionally, we reveal that FKBP8 demethylation by KDM1A is critical for liver cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We went on to explore the mechanisms that might regulate KDM1A cytoplasmic localization. We found that the cytoplasmic localization and protein stability of KDM1A were promoted by acetylation at lysine-117 by the acetyl transferase KAT8 (lysine acetyltransferase 8). In agreement with this, we show that KDM1A–K117 (lysine 117) acetylation promotes demethylation of FKBP8 and level of BCL2. Finally, it has been shown that the efficacy of sorafenib, a first-line treatment for advanced HCC, is limited by clinical resistance. We show that KDM1A and BCL2 protein levels are increased during acquired sorafenib resistance, whereas inhibiting KDM1A can antagonize sorafenib resistance. Collectively, these results define a functional KDM1A–FKBP8–BCL2 axis in HCC. Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a dismal prognosis.

Collectively, these results define a functional KDM1A–FKBP8–BCL2 axis in HCC. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major causes to cancer-related mortality, with over 800,000 new cases and mortalities each year (1Sung H. Ferlay J. Siegel R.L. Laversanne M. Soerjomataram I. Jemal A. et al.Global cancer statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2021; 71: 209-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (17955) Google Scholar). Advanced HCC has dismal prognosis with half-survival time at only about 1 year. HCC is notoriously refractory to most conventional chemotherapy. Sorafenib has been a first-line target therapy for advanced HCC (2Llovet J.M. Ricci S. Mazzaferro V. Hilgard P. Gane E.

Systemic therapy of liver cancer.Adv. Cancer Res. 2021; 149: 257-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Sorafenib works as a multitarget kinase inhibitor, which blocks important pathways including Raf (the rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma)/mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Kit, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, leading to decreased tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, and increased tumor cell apoptosis (4Zhu Y.J. Zheng B. Wang H.Y. Chen L. New knowledge of the mechanisms of sorafenib resistance in liver cancer.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2017; 38: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Yet, efficacy of sorafenib is limited by clinical resistance because of primary or acquired mechanisms, such as activation of epidermal growth factor receptor, PI3K/AKT, hypoxia-inducible factors, stress-coping mechanisms, and increased cancer stem cell populations (4Zhu Y.J.

Multiple epigenetic machineries also contribute to sorafenib resistance, including noncoding RNAs, DNA methylation, and histone modifications (5Tang W. Chen Z. Zhang W. Cheng Y. Zhang B.

N terminus of KDM1A, dispensable for its catalytic activity (20Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. Human histone demethylase LSD1 reads the histone code.J. Biol.

Besides, aberrant localization of KDM1A to cytoplasm is associated with pathology (22Engstrom A.K. Walker A.C. Moudgal R.A. Myrick D.A. Kyle S.M.

Yet, it is currently unknown how the translocalization of KDM1A to cytoplasm and its function thereof are regulated.FKBP8 (FKBP prolyl isomerase 8), a member of the proline-isomerase family, plays a role in immunoregulation, cellular autophagy, and apoptosis (23Edlich F.

Antiapoptotic role of FKBP8 is also supported by in vivo study with genetically modified mouse models (29Wang H.Q. Nakaya Y. Du Z. Yamane T. Shirane M.

Mechanistic studies reveal that FKBP8 regulates apoptosis through regulating the stability and localization of BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) (26Shirane M. Nakayama K.I.

The effect on BCL2 relies on the interaction of FKBP8 with and activation by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) (28Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghanel J. Jarczowski F.

Chem. 2007; 282: 36496-36504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, FKBP8 is considered as an important contributor to cellular resistance to chemotherapy (32Choi B.H. Yoon H.S. FKBP38-Bcl-2 interaction: a novel link to chemoresistance.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2011; 11: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Yet, how function of FKBP8–BCL2 axis is regulated in HCC is not clear.In this study, we found that KDM1A could be acetylated at lysine-117 in the NLS by lysine acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8), increasing cytoplasmic level of KDM1A. Cytoplasmic KDM1A could then interact with and demethylate FKBP8, which enhanced its ability to stabilize BCL2 in HCC cells. We further found that KDM1A–BCl2 axis was increased during acquired resistance to sorafenib, and inhibiting this signal axis could overcome sorafenib resistance.ResultsCytoplasmic KDM1A promotes HCC cell growthAnalysis of proteomic data from 159 pairs of HCC tumor and normal tissues (33Gao Q. Zhu H. Dong L. Shi W. Chen R. Song Z. et al.Integrated proteogenomic characterization of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.Cell. 2019; 179: 561-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) showed that KDM1A protein level was increased in cancer compared with normal tissue (Fig. S1A). Survival analysis of the same dataset (Fig. S1B) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (Fig. S1C) showed that higher KDM1A level correlated with poorer prognosis in HCC patients. To examine the role of KDM1A in HCC cell growth, we knocked down KDM1A in HLF human liver cancer cells and detected significant decrease in cell proliferation (Figs. 1A and S1D), which could be ameliorated by expressing exogenous KDM1A (Figs. 1B and S1E). Knocking down KDM1A decreased cell clonogenicity as well (Fig. 1C). Consistently, KDM1A inhibitor treatment also decreased cell proliferation significantly (Fig. S1F). These results showed that KDM1A was required for HCC cell proliferation. To explore potential connection between function of KDM1A and its subcellular localization, we examined localization of KDM1A. A small yet significant portion of KDM1A was detected in the cytoplasm by both subcellular fractionation and cell imaging (Fig. 1, D, E,and F). We next examined whether cytoplasmic KDM1A might affect cell proliferation. In KDM1A-KD (knockdown) cell, we rescue-expressed KDM1A–K114A/R115A mutant, which predominantly localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. S1, G and H) as reported (21Jin Y. Kim T.Y. Kim M.S.

We found that KDM1A–K114A/R115A (referred to as KDM1A-AA hereafter) significantly rescued defect in cell proliferation (Figs. 1G and S1I) in enzymatic activity–dependent manner (Figs. 1H and S1J). In conclusion, these data showed that KDM1A partially localized to cytoplasm, and cytoplasmic KDM1A could promote HCC cell growth.FKBP8 interacts with KDM1A and mediates cytoplasmic KDM1A functionTo explore the mechanism underlying regulation of cell proliferation by cytoplasmic KDM1A, we performed mass spectrometry (MS) to identify the interactome of KDM1A (Table S2). Interestingly, FKBP8 was identified, which was reported to localize to cytoplasm and regulate apoptosis. Immunostaining of myc-FKBP8 in AD293 cell and HLF confirmed that FKBP8 mainly localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. S2, A and B). Proteomic study (33Gao Q. Zhu H. Dong L. Shi W. Chen R. Song Z. et al.Integrated proteogenomic characterization of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.Cell. 2019; 179: 561-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) showed that FKBP8 protein level was also increased in HCC tissue compared with normal liver (Fig. S2C). Meanwhile, TCGA dataset suggested that higher FKBP8 level correlates with poorer survival in liver cancer patients (Fig. S2D). To examine the role of FKBP8 in HCC, we knocked down FKBP8 in HLF and detected significant decrease in cell growth and clonogenesis (Figs. 2A, S2E and 2B) accompanied with apoptosis (Fig. 2C). Next, we confirmed the MS result with coimmunoprecipitation (IP) and found that both exogenous and endogenous FKBP8 interacted with KDM1A (Figs. 2D, S2F and 2E). Domain mapping showed that the C-terminal part of FKBP8 cytoplasmic domain mediated interaction with KDM1A (Figs. 2F and S2G). Importantly, while KDM1A-AA increased cell proliferation in KDM1A-KD cell, such effect was largely abolished by FKBP8-KD (Figs. 2G and S2H). Collectively, these data showed that KDM1A interacted with FKBP8 and indicated FKBP8 was a critical cytoplasmic effector of KDM1A.Figure 2FKBP8 interacts with KDM1A and mediates cytoplasmic KDM1A function.

We tested potential activity of a panel of methyltransferases on FKBP8 and found that SMYD3 (SET and MYND domain–containing 3) increased methylation of FKBP8 (Fig. 3A). Consistently, SMYD3 was partially localized to cytoplasm in both AD293 and HLF cells (Fig. S3, A and B). Only SMYD3 WT but not catalytically inactive mutant could increase FKBP8 methylation (Fig. 3B) in a dosage-dependent manner (Fig. S3C). With in vitro methylation assay, we showed that SMYD3 directly methylated FKBP8 (Fig. 3C). Next, we set out to identify the methylated site. With deletion mutants, we narrowed down the methylation site to region 365 to 388 amino acids (Fig. S3D). Consistently, MS identified K377 to be methylated (Fig. S3E). Indeed, mutation of K377 but not adjacent lysines of FKBP8 to arginine abolished its methylation by SMYD3 (Figs. 3D and S3F). Next, we examined whether KDM1A could demethylate FKBP8. Coexpression with KDM1A-WT but not inactive mutant decreased FKBP8 methylation (Fig. 3E).Consistently, treatment with KDM1A selective inhibitor ORY1001 (TargetMol; catalog no.: T6922) increased FKBP8 methylation (Fig. 3F). In addition, KDM1A-AA demethylated FKBP8 more effectively than its WT counterpart, consistent with the cytoplasmic localization of FKBP8 (Fig. 3G). We then performed in vitro demethylation assay and further confirmed that KDM1A directly demethylated FKBP8 (Fig. 3H). Collectively, these data showed that KDM1A demethylated FKBP8–K377 in the cytoplasm.Figure 3FKBP8 is demethylated by KDM1A. A, FLAG-FKBP8 was cotransfected with Myc-tag methyltransferases into 293T cells. Methylation of FKBP8 was analyzed with IP–WB. (Me-K means methyl-lysine).

Consistently, FKBP8-KD also decreased BCL2 protein level in HLF cells (Fig. S4A). We then examined whether KDM1A might affect FKBP8–BCL2 axis. KDM1A knocking-down or inhibitor treatment decreased the protein level of BCL2 but not FKBP8 (Fig. 4, A and B). We found that expressing KDM1A-AA in KDM1A-KD cell restored BCL2 protein level (Fig. 4C) but not mRNA level (Fig. S4B). To corroborate the connection between KDM1A and BCL2, we analyzed the protein level of KDM1A and BCL2 in 24 pairs of HCC patient samples with Western blot (WB) (Fig. S4C). Besides that BCL2, FKBP8, and KDM1A were increased in tumor compared with normal tissues (Fig. S4, C–F), we also observed significant correlation between KDM1A and BCL2 protein level (Fig. 4D). Next, we examined whether FKBP8 was involved in regulation of BCL2 by KDM1A. Knocking down FKBP8 abolished the effect of KDM1A-AA on BCL2, suggesting that cytoplasmic KDM1A regulated BCL2 through FKBP8 (Fig. 4E). To examine whether KDM1A regulated BCL2 through demethylating FKBP8, we rescue-expressed FKBP8-WT or FKBP8–K377R (referred to as FKBP8–K/R hereafter) in cells with both FKBP8-KD and KDM1A-KD. The result showed FKBP8–K/R more potently restored BCL2 protein level than FKBP8-WT (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, while overexpressing KDM1A-AA increased BCL2 in FKBP8-WT cells, little effect was seen in FKBP8–K/R cells (Fig. 4G). Indeed, FKBP8–K/R was more potent than WT in promoting cell proliferation in vitro in multiple HCC cell lines (Figs. 4H and S4, G–J). We further confirmed that FKBP–K/R was more potent in promoting xenograft tumor growth in nude mice model (Fig. 4I). These results showed that KDM1A upregulated BCL2 through FKBP8 demethylation. We next explored how FKBP8–K377 methylation affected FKBP8 function. Regulation of BCL2 by FKBP8 was reported to depend on its interaction with CaM. We found FKBP8–K/R bound CaM more efficiently than WT, and methylation indeed reduced FKBP8 binding with CaM (Figs. 4J and S4K). Collectively, these data showed that KDM1A increased BCL2 protein level through demethylating FKBP8.Figure 4KDM1A regulates BCL2 protein level via FKBP8 demethylation.

Factors contributing to disease severity are complex and there is currently no consensus on a scoring tool for use in community-based studies.Data were collected during a passive surveillance system in an outpatient health facility in Lusaka, Zambia from March 2019 to July 2019. Diarrhea episodes were assessed for severity using an in-house severity scoring tool (CIDRZ) and previously published scores (Vesikari, Clark, CODA, and DHAKA). The CIDRZ score was constructed using fieldworker-reported clinical signs and exploratory factor analysis. We used precision-recall curves measuring severe diarrhoea (i.e., requiring intravenous rehydration or referred for hospital admission) to determine the best performing scores. Then, we used Cronbach's alpha to assess the scale's internal consistency. Finally, we used Cohen's kappa to assess agreement between the scores.Of 110 diarrhea episodes, 3 (3%) required intravenous rehydration or were referred for hospital admission. The precision-recall area under the curve of each score as a predictor of severe diarrhoea requiring intravenous rehydration or hospital admission was 0.26 for Vesikari, 0.18 for CODA, 0.24 for Clark, 0.59 for DHAKA, and 0.59 for CIDRZ. The CIDRZ scale had substantial reliability and performed similarly to the DHAKA score.Diarrhoea severity scores focused on characteristics specific to dehydration status may better predict severe diarrhea among children in Lusaka. Aetiology-specific scoring tools may not be appropriate for use in community healthcare settings. Validation studies for the CIDRZ score in diverse settings and with larger sample sizes are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4291618062,"Introduction Vulnerability for depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms due to perceived traumatic birth increase during the postpartum period. Traumatic birth has been defined as an event occurring during labour and birth that may be a serious threat to the life and safety of the mother and/or child. However, the comorbidity and multimorbidity of depression, anxiety and PTSD with their direct and indirect predictors is not well investigated in the postpartum period. In addition, the longitudinal directional association of depression, anxiety and PTSD with their comorbidities is not studied in Ethiopia. Objective The aim of this study was to assess prevalence of postnatal comorbid and multimorbid anxiety, depression and PTSD. It also aimed to determine the directional association of postnatal anxiety, depression and PTSD with the comorbidity and multimorbidity of these mental health problems over time and to explore the factors that are directly or indirectly associated with comorbidity and multimorbidity of anxiety, depression and PTSD. Methods A total of 775 women were included at the first, second and third follow-up of the study (6 th , 12 th and 18 th week of postpartum period) during October, 2020 –March, 2021. A cross-lagged autoregressive path analysis was carried out using Stata 16.0 software in order to determine the autoregressive and cross-lagged effects of depression, anxiety and PTSD with their comorbidities. In addition, a linear structural equation modelling was also carried out to determine the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on the comorbidities of depression, anxiety and PTSD. Results Comorbidity of anxiety with depression was the most common (14.5%, 12.1% and 8.1%) at the 6 th , 12 th and 18 th week of postnatal period respectively. With regard to the direction of association, comorbidity of PTSD (due to perceived traumatic birth) with depression, PTSD with anxiety, depression with anxiety and triple comorbidity predicted depression and anxiety in subsequent waves of measurement. Direct and indirect maternal morbidity, fear of childbirth and perceived traumatic childbirth were found to have a direct and indirect positive association with comorbidities of depression, anxiety and PTSD. In contrast, higher parity, higher family size and higher social support had a direct and indirect negative association with these mental health disorders. Conclusion Postnatal mental health screening, early diagnosis and treatment of maternal morbidities, developing encouraging strategies for social support and providing adequate information about birth procedures and response to mothers’ needs during childbirth are essential to avert comorbidity of anxiety, depression and PTSD in the postpartum period."
https://openalex.org/W4291618140,"Background Cancer is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide and the first cause of mortality in Canada with 30.2% of deaths attributable to cancer. Given aging of the population and the improvement of prevention and treatment protocols, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing. These individuals have unique physical and mental health needs some of which can be addressed by integrating physical activity promotion into ongoing and long-term care. Despite the benefits of being active, delivery of PA programs for cancer patients in both clinical and community settings remains challenging. This knowledge-to-action protocol–called Kiné-Onco–aims to develop a practice guideline for the delivery, implementation, and scaling-up of cancer-specific physical activity promotion programs and services in clinical and community settings located in Québec, Canada. Method The Kiné-Onco project involves knowledge synthesis of scientific and grey literature to establish the benefits and added value of physical activity for cancer patients and survivors, describes current practices in delivering physical activity programs, analyses quantitative data from electronic health records (EHR) of patients participating in a novel hospital-based physical activity program, collects and analyses qualitative data from patients and healthcare providers interviews about lived experience, facilitators, and barriers to physical activity promotion, outlines deliberative workshops among multidisciplinary team members to develop implementation guidelines for physical activity promotion, and summarizes a variety of knowledge transfer and exchange activities to disseminate the practice guidelines. Discussion This paper describes the protocol for a knowledge-to-action project aimed at producing and sharing actionable evidence. Our aim is that physical activity promotion programs and services be scaled up in such a way as to successfully integrate physical activity promotion throughout cancer treatment and survivorship in order to improve the physical and mental health of the growing population of individuals having received a cancer diagnosis."

However, the worldwide prevalence of COVID-19 in this population is only 1%–2%. In Mexico, the prevalence of COVID-19 in children has increased to 10%. As serology-based studies are scarce, we analyzed the clinical features and serological response (SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins) of children and adolescents who visited the Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez (October 2020–March 2021). The majority were 9-year-old children without comorbidities who were treated as outpatients and had mild-to-moderate illness. Children aged 6–10 years and adolescents aged 11–15 years had the maximum number of symptoms, including those with obesity. Nevertheless, children with comorbidities such as immunosuppression, leukemia, and obesity exhibited the lowest antibody response, whereas those aged 1–5 years with heart disease had the highest levels of antibodies. The SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain-localized peptides and M and E proteins had the best antibody response. In conclusion, Mexican children and adolescents with COVID-19 represent a heterogeneous population, and comorbidities play an important role in the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4291907309,"Foraging decisions by rodents are key for the long-term maintenance of oak populations in which avian seed dispersers are absent or inefficient. Decisions are determined by the environmental setting in which acorn-rodent encounters occur. In particular, seed value, competition and predation risks have been found to modify rodent foraging decisions in forest and human-modified habitats. Nonetheless, there is little information about their joint effects on rodent behavior, and hence, local acorn dispersal (or predation). In this work, we manipulate and model the mouse-oak interaction in a Spanish dehesa, an anthropogenic savanna system in which nearby areas can show contrasting levels of ungulate densities and antipredatory cover. First, we conducted a large-scale cafeteria field experiment, where we modified ungulate presence and predation risk, and followed mouse foraging decisions under contrasting levels of moonlight and acorn availability. Then, we estimated the net effects of competition and risk by means of a transition probability model that simulated mouse foraging decisions. Our results show that mice are able to adapt their foraging decisions to the environmental context, affecting initial fates of handled acorns. Under high predation risks mice foraged opportunistically carrying away large and small seeds, whereas under safe conditions large acorns tended to be predated in situ . In addition, in the presence of ungulates lack of antipredatory cover around trees reduced mice activity outside tree canopies, and hence, large acorns had a higher probability of survival. Overall, our results point out that inter-specific interactions preventing efficient foraging by scatter-hoarders can reduce acorn predation. This suggests that the maintenance of the full set of seed consumers as well as top predators in dehesas may be key for promoting local dispersal."

Schistosomiasis, one of the most widespread neglected tropical diseases, affects more than 200 million people worldwide. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are prominent epigenetic drugs that are being investigated in the treatment of several diseases, including cancers and parasitic diseases. Schistosoma mansoni HDAC8 (SmHDAC8) is highly expressed in all life cycle stages of the parasite, and selective inhibition is required in order to avoid undesirable off-target effects in the host. Herein, by X-ray crystal structures of SmHDAC8-inhibitor complexes, biochemical and phenotypic studies, we found two schistosomicidal spiroindoline derivatives binding a novel site, next to Trp198, on the enzyme surface. We determined that by acting on this site, either by mutation of the Trp198 or by compound binding, a decrease in the activity of the enzyme is achieved. Remarkably, this allosteric site differs from the human counterpart; rather, it is conserved in all Schistosoma species, as well as Rhabidoptera and Trematoda classes, thus paving the way for the design of HDAC8-selective allosteric inhibitors with improved properties.

Control of schistosomiasis is of global medical and veterinary importance for the World Health Organization 2021 to 2030 neglected tropical disease road map (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240010352). Schistosomiasis is a chronic and debilitating disease, caused by the parasitic trematodes of the genus Schistosoma. It is spread worldwide in tropical and subtropical areas, and it affects more than 200 million people with the greatest human burden within sub-Saharan Africa. Three main species of schistosomes infect humans, namely Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mansoni, and Schistosoma japonicum. Schistosomes have a complex life cycle and develop in the intermediate freshwater snail hosts and in mammalian definitive hosts, such as humans, through several different morphological stages. The pathology occurs mainly from the parasite eggs trapped in the host tissues that cause host immune response and severe granulomatous reactions (1McManus D.P. Dunne D.W. Sacko M. Utzinger J. Vennervald B.J. Zhou X.N. Schistosomiasis.Nat. Rev. Dis. Prim. 2018; 4: 1-19PubMed Google Scholar). Nowadays, praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice in the treatment of schistosomiasis; however, it is not effective on juvenile parasites and it does not prevent reinfection (2Cioli D. Pica-Mattoccia L. Basso A. Guidi A. Schistosomiasis control: praziquantel forever?.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2014; 195: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Various combinations of Schistosoma species (spp) hybrids have been documented within snails, livestock, wildlife, and within humans and their sensitivity to PZQ is still poorly investigated (3Leger E. Webster J.P. Hybridizations within the genus schistosoma: implications for evolution, epidemiology and control.Parasitology. 2017; 144: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, for its massive and widespread use, the possible occurrence of drug resistance to PZQ is an ever-present threat. Overall, the social and economic burden due to schistosomiasis is very high and novel drugs for prevention and treatment besides sanitation are required. Promising drug targets in Schistosoma, as in other parasites, are histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes, members of an evolutionarily ancient enzyme family that regulate the activity of their substrates by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues. Lysine acetylation is one of the major posttranslational protein modifications playing strategic roles in cell signaling, cell cycle control, and in epigenetic regulation of gene expression (4Hailu G.S. Robaa D. Forgione M. Sippl W. Rotili D. Mai A. Lysine deacetylase inhibitors in parasites: past, present, and future perspectives.J. Med. Chem. 2017; 60: 4780-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Due to the poor selectivity and undesirable side effects that occur with pan-inhibitors, the development of selective inhibitors has attracted the attention of several investigators. S. mansoni expresses several HDACs and among them HDAC8, a class I HDAC, particularly abundant in all stages of the parasite life cycle and poorly expressed in healthy human tissues, is largely recognized as a promising therapeutic target (5Oger F. Dubois F. Caby S. Noël C. Cornette J. Bertin B. et al.The class I histone deacetylases of the platyhelminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hosoi F. et al.Expression profile of class I histone deacetylases in human cancer tissues.Oncol. Rep. 2007; 18: 769-774PubMed Google Scholar). Class I HDACs (HDAC1-3 and HDAC8) are highly regulated. HDAC8, located both in the nucleus and in the cytosol, is the only one acting as a monomer, while all other Class I HDACs work as components of multiprotein complexes, opening the challenging possibility to get isoform selectivity through the design of inhibitors of individual complexes (7Millard C.J.

Sci. 2017; 38: 363-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Human HDAC1-3 enzymatic activity could be also positively modulated by inositol phosphates through an allosteric communication between the inositol-binding site and the catalytic site (8Osko J.D. Porter N.J. Decroos C. Lee M.S. Watson P.R. Raible S.E. et al.Structural analysis of histone deacetylase 8 mutants associated with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome spectrum disorders.J. Struct. Biol. 2021; 213107681Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Recently, a region mapping to α1-loop1-α2 has been identified as an allosteric site in human HDAC8 (9Werbeck N.D. Shukla V.K. Kunze M.B.A. Yalinca H. Pritchard R.B. Siemons L. et al.A distal regulatory region of a class I human histone deacetylase.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A better knowledge of the mechanisms regulating the enzymatic activity and a deeper knowledge of the structure of each HDAC isoform can be instrumental for the design of selective inhibitors. SmHDAC8 is a metal-dependent enzyme, harboring a zinc ion in the active site, and, so far, the vast majority of discovered inhibitors present a zinc-binding group, such as a hydroxamate or a sulfur moiety (10Ghazy E. Abdelsalam M. Robaa D. Pierce R.J. Sippl W. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors for the treatment of schistosomiasis.Pharmaceuticals. 2022; 15: 80Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Specificity toward different HDAC isoforms may be obtained by an appropriately designed linker and cap groups or by exploiting specific and unique regulatory sites. Through a concerted effort involving molecular modeling, phenotypic screening, and enzymatic inhibition assays of SmHDAC8 enzyme, we previously identified novel HDAC inhibitors as promising multistage antischistosomicidal hits (11Saccoccia F.

The most interesting scaffold presented a thieno[3,2-b]indole (compound NF2624) or a spiro-indoline (compounds NF2453, NF2452) core moieties coupled to a hydroxamate-based zinc-binding group ((11Saccoccia F. Brindisi M. Gimmelli R. Relitti N. Guidi A. Saraswati A.P. et al.Screening and phenotypical characterization of Schistosoma mansoni Histone Deacetylase 8 (SmHDAC8) inhibitors as multistage antischistosomal agents.ACS Infect. Dis. 2020; 6: 100-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Fig. 1). Based on our previous results, we investigated the structure–activity relationships of both scaffolds, developing new inhibitors. X-ray complexes structures as well as biochemical and phenotypic assays were crucial to characterize the binding mode and activity of the novel NF2886, NF2883, and NF2889 and the former NF2624. We successfully solved the X-ray crystal structures of SmHDAC8 in complex with all of the four analogs, representative of both classes of compounds. Remarkably, we discovered that the spiroindoline derivatives, NF2883 and NF2889, bind a specific site different from the catalytic site, in the vicinity of Trp198 on the enzyme surface, and inhibit the enzyme in a mixed/allosteric manner. Multiple sequence alignment shows differences at this site in S. mansoni and human HDAC8. Phylogeny studies reveal that this site is conserved in all Schistosoma spp, paving the way for the discovery of selective SmHDAC8 inhibitors, and in other members of the Trematoda phylum, opening the possibility to identify compounds active toward several pathogenic parasites. We have recently identified through virtual screening and phenotypical studies of selected hits, novel HDAC inhibitors characterized by the presence of a hydroxamate-based metal-binding group coupled to a tricyclic thieno[3,2-b]indole or a spiro-indoline core as capping groups able to impair viability of larval, juvenile, and adult S. mansoni and inhibiting SmHDAC8 recombinant protein activity in vitro (11Saccoccia F.

Dis. 2020; 6: 100-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Among the previously identified class of inhibitors, we designed novel molecules in order to investigate the structure–activity relationships of the two scaffolds. In the frame of this work, we synthesized the novel derivative NF2886, bearing a Br-substituent, and spiroindoline derivatives NF2883 and NF2889, bearing a thiophene ring as an anchor for the hydroxamate moiety (Fig. 1). Figure 2 reports the synthesis of NF2886 (panel A), NF2883 and NF2889 (panel B). Compounds NF2886, NF2883, and NF2889 inhibit in vitro the enzymatic activity of SmHDAC8 and Homo sapiens (h)HDAC8 recombinant proteins, the IC50 being in the micromolar and submicromolar range (Table 1). The previously published results for reference compounds NF2624, NF2453, and NF2452 are also reported for comparison (11Saccoccia F. Brindisi M. Gimmelli R. Relitti N. Guidi A.

The Fluor-de-Lys substrate was used at 50 μM, and the inhibitor concentrations ranged from 25 μM to 0.04 μM. Fluorine (NF2624) and bromine (NF2886) derivatives show similar IC50 toward both human and schistosoma enzymes. A major improvement in IC50 was detected for the spiroindoline derivatives toward SmHDAC8 and hHDAC8. In particular, NF2883 shows about 20-fold enhancement in potency with respect to NF2453 toward both SmHDAC8 and hHDAC8, while NF2889 shows a 6-fold and a 2-fold improvement in potency toward parasite and human enzyme with respect to NF2452. The three novel molecules were tested in their ability to impair both S. mansoni larvae (schistosomula) and adult worm pairs viability (Fig. 3, panel A and B). The effect of inhibitors on schistosomula was assessed using an ATP-based assay previously developed and validated in our laboratory (12Lalli C. Guidi A. Gennari N. Altamura S. Bresciani A.

Compounds NF2883 and NF2889 showed to be more effective in killing parasites’ larvae. Their estimated LD50 is similar to the one previously reported for NF2452 (20.59, 95% confidence interval: 11.47–24.80 μM) and NF2453 (13.31, 95% confidence interval: 11.85–15.27 μM) (11Saccoccia F.

Dis. 2020; 6: 100-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the contrary, NF2886 was poorly effective; the estimated LD50 (∼60 μM) is higher than the LD50 of NF2624 (23.29, 95% confidence interval: 20.81–25.28 μM) previously reported (11Saccoccia F.

Dis. 2020; 6: 100-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the bromine substitution has a deleterious effect on the schistosomicidal activity. Also, the impact of the three compounds on adult worm pairs viability was monitored for 7 days upon treatment. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)–treated parasites were used as negative control (100% viability) and the novel compounds were assayed at the indicated concentrations (Fig. 3B). Viability of each schistosome was graded from 3 (normal) to 0 (severe effect) by assigning daily worm phenotype scores as previously described (see Experimental procedures) (12Lalli C. Guidi A. Gennari N. Altamura S. Bresciani A. Ruberti G. Development and validation of a luminescence-based, medium-throughput assay for drug screening in Schistosoma mansoni.PLoS Negl. Trop.

Dis. 2017; 11e0005994Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The results show that NF2883 and NF2889 are slightly more potent than NF2886; in fact, at a concentration of 50 μM, both NF2883 and NF2889 caused an immediate loss of viability at 24 h. The same compounds at 20 μM markedly reduce parasite viability in a time-dependent manner, resulting in almost complete death at 7 days. Both compounds were also active at 10 μM, causing a 50% reduction of viability at day 7. On the other hand, NF2886 was less active at both 20 and 50 μM, inducing approximately a 50% reduction of viability at day 7 and being ineffective at 10 μM. In order to investigate the effects of the new compounds on HDACs activity on cultured worms, acetylation of lysine residues within histone proteins was evaluated. Based on the viability dose-responses curves, worm pairs were treated with sublethal (10 μM NF2883 72 h, 10 μM NF2886 72 h, 5 μM NF2889 72 h) or concentrations of compounds that only partially impair viability (50%) (20 μM NF2883 24 h, 20 μM NF2886 24 h, 10 μM NF2889 24 h). Next, histone-enriched fractions of parasite lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). Treatment with the pan-HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA, 1 μM) and NF2624 (20 μM) (11Saccoccia F. Brindisi M. Gimmelli R. Relitti N. Guidi A. Saraswati A.P. et al.Screening and phenotypical characterization of Schistosoma mansoni Histone Deacetylase 8 (SmHDAC8) inhibitors as multistage antischistosomal agents.ACS Infect. Dis. 2020; 6: 100-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) compounds were used as positive controls. About 10-fold and 7-fold increases of K-acetylation to tubulin ratio versus control were observed for the TSA and NF2624 treated samples. An increase of lysine acetylation signal was detected for all experimental compound-treated samples, in particular for worms treated with NF2889 at 10 μM for 24 h (6.5-fold increase versus DMSO) and at 5 μM for 72 h (11-fold increase versus DMSO) (Fig. 3C). Three bands ranging from ∼11 to ∼16 kDa were detected: the lower mobility bands likely correspond to the hyperacetylated forms of H2B (∼13 kDa) and H2A (∼16 kDa), whereas the one migrating faster is ascribable to histone H4 (11 kDa). We obtained the crystal structures of SmHDAC8 in complexes with NF2624 (Protein Data Bank [PDB] entry 7P2S) and NF2886 (PDB entry 7P2T). These structures were overall similar to previously reported structures of the enzyme bound to hydroxamate-based inhibitors in the catalytic binding site (15Marek M. Kannan S. Hauser A.T.

Details about structure determination and the crystallographic data are reported in the Experimental procedures section and in Supporting Information S1. Depiction of binding and details about the binding poses for both the compounds are reported in Supporting Information S2 and S3. The full list of interactions of compounds NF2624 and NF2886 within 4 Å distance to protein residues is reported in Supporting Information S4. Moreover, we obtained a crystal structure of the enzyme with a DMSO molecule in the active site (PDB entry 7P0Z). This structure revealed that DMSO interacts with zinc and that the Tyr341 residue may adopt a flip-in conformation within the active site (Supporting Information S5). The Tyr341 conformation was previously reported in its flip-in conformation in the presence of an inhibitor bound in the active site and in its flip-out conformation in the presence of tartrate (PDB entry 4bz5; (15Marek M. Kannan S. Hauser A.T. Moraes Mourão M. Caby S. Cura V. et al.Structural basis for the inhibition of Histone Deacetylase 8 (HDAC8), a key epigenetic player in the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9e1003645Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). Conversely, in the structure of SmHDAC8 with NF2886, in all out of the four chains, the Tyr341 was found in its flip-out conformation. These results suggest that the active site may have a number of accessible conformations of the side chains of critical residues irrespective of the molecule bound within it. Interestingly, it is worth noting that the flip-out conformation of Tyr341 seems strictly coupled to the flip-out conformation of Phe151; indeed, the flip-out Tyr341 was found only in those structures where Phe151 is in the same conformation. The conformation of Phe151 and Tyr341 detected in all of the SmHDAC8 crystal structures reported so far are listed in Supporting Information S5. We also succeeded in obtaining the crystal structures of complexes of SmHDAC8 with NF2883 and NF2889. Details about structure determination and crystallographic data are reported in the Experimental procedures section and in Supporting Information S1. The crystal structure of these complexes revealed that both NF2883 and NF2889 bind in a similar manner a novel site of the protein, contributed by amino acids belonging to helices α9, the loop between β5 and α9, and the loop between sheets β5 and β6. Structural superpositions of NF2883 and NF2889 are reported in Supporting Information S6. In Figure 4, the structure of SmHDAC8 in complex with NF2889 is shown. The new binding site lies on the surface of the macromolecule, ∼18 Å from the active site (taking the zinc ion as a pivot, Fig. 4A). The binding cleft is composed by His189, Glu194, Glu195, Trp198, Thr219, Leu234, and Asn246 residues that contribute through their main and side chains atoms, together with water molecules, to the interaction with NF2883 and NF2889 compounds. The presence of Trp198 is of outstanding importance; indeed, in the human HDAC8, the same position is occupied by a serine residue (Ser190, according to PDB entry 1t64), thus conferring a peculiar feature to this site in Schistosoma mansoni’s enzyme. In addition, Glu195 in SmHDAC8 is replaced by an aspartic residue in the human ortholog (Asp187). Taking the structure of NF2889 as reference (due to its higher resolution), many characteristic interactions can be observed, with Glu195 and Trp198 showing to contribute utmost in the inhibitor binding. Indeed, the indole portion of Trp198 forms a π–π stacking with the thiophene ring along with a T-shaped hydrophobic interaction with the indoline portion of the cap group (Fig. 4B). Hydrophobic interactions are also present between the methyl-piperidine portion of NF2889 and the aliphatic carbons of Glu195. At 3.9 Å distance, Leu234 makes contact with the sulfur of the thiophene ring. On the other hand, the hydroxamate group makes hydrogen bonds with the lateral chain of Glu194 and the main chain atoms of Gly220; in addition, a water molecule bridges the hydroxamate moiety and the main chain atoms of Thr221. The full list of interactions within 4 Å distance for both NF2883 and NF2889 is reported in Supporting information S4. It is worth mentioning here that the chlorine atom is engaged by the CH3 of Thr219 at 4.3 Å distance. This specific interaction is shared between the binding modes of both NF2883 and NF2889; however, due to the parasubstitution, NF2883 is forced to hold a slightly different position with respect to NF2889, in order to mediate the same interaction (Supporting Information S6). Trp198 is likely to have the greatest role in mediating the interactions of SmHDAC8 with both NF2883 and NF2889 (Fig. 4 and Supporting Information S6). To get insights on its role and to further characterize the novel binding site, we generated a SmHDAC8 W198A mutant. The comparison of the fluorescence emission of the WT SmHDAC8, containing eight tryptophan residues, and the W198A was fundamental to investigate the impact of the mutation on compounds’ binding. Both WT and W198A mutant proteins were incubated either with DMSO (control), NF2886, and NF2889, and fluorescence emission between 310 and 450 nm was recorded after excitation at both 280 and 298 nm wavelengths. Once incubated with NF2886 or NF2889, the fluorescence signal of WT is quenched with respect to that of control (Fig. 5, panel A). Similarly, the emission of the WT enzyme, recorded after excitation at 298 nm, shows a quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence with both compounds (Fig. 5C). On the contrary, the fluorescence spectra recorded for the W198A mutant in presence of NF2886 or NF2889 showed different spectra with respect to the ones recorded for the WT: for instance, a quenching of fluorescence after excitation at 280 nm was observed only in presence of NF2886 but not with NF2889 (Fig. 5B). In addition, after excitation at 298 nm, the signal of the mutant incubated with NF2886 still shows a quenching; on the other hand, incubation with NF2889 shows a spectrum similar to the one of the control sample (Fig. 5D). Additional experiments were performed with 2 mM Na/K-tartrate, in order to mimic the conditions used in the crystallization trials. Interestingly, the strongest influence of tartrate was detected with the SmHDAC8 mutant incubated with NF2886. In this case, the fluorescence signal, recorded after excitation at 298 nm, was less quenched and showed a shape of the spectrum (Supporting Information S7, panel G), different to the one without tartrate (Supporting Information S7, panel D). This behavior can likely be ascribed to the relative competition by tartrate and NF2886 in their binding to the active site. The fluorescence spectra of WT and mutant incubated with NF2889 were not perturbed by the presence of tartrate, as expected for the binding to a different site (Supporting Information S7). Remarkably, the mutation W198A had also a strong impact on the enzymatic activity of SmHDAC8: indeed, the W198A mutant shows only about 40% of residual activity with respect to the WT enzyme in the same experimental conditions (Table 2).Table 2Comparison of the enzymatic activities of the W198A mutant and WT SmHDAC8 proteinsWT∗W198A#Activity, %10037.8 ± 8.1Average of three (∗) or five (#) independent experiments ± SD (statistical significance, p < 0.01.

Protein concentration was 0.6 μM and substrate concentration was 50 μM. This finding, along with the inhibition studies reported below on the WT SmHDAC8, raises the suspicion of an allosteric inhibition by NF2889 upon binding to the novel site. Indeed, perturbing the region either by a point mutation or by inhibitor binding results in a decrease in the enzymatic activity. The structural data and fluorescence studies on SmHDAC8 suggest the possibility that the molecules NF2624/NF2886 and NF2883/NF2889 are acting by a different mechanism of inhibition. Both NF2624 and NF2886, which bind the enzyme active site, allegedly would behave as competitive inhibitors; conversely, the inhibition by NF2883/NF2889 was expected to show a different feature due to binding to the novel site. To investigate the type of inhibition, steady-state kinetic experiments on SmHDAC8 and hHDAC8 were performed, with a fixed concentration of either NF2886 or NF2889 (taken as representative for alleged competitive and for a mixed mechanism of inhibition, respectively). The results are report"
https://openalex.org/W4291109527,"The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) EphA2 is expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells and controls the assembly of cell-cell junctions. EphA2 has also been implicated in many diseases, including cancer. Unlike most RTKs, which signal predominantly as dimers, EphA2 readily forms high-order oligomers upon ligand binding. Here, we investigated if a correlation exists between EphA2 signaling properties and the size of the EphA2 oligomers induced by multiple ligands, including the widely used ephrinA1-Fc ligand, the soluble monomeric m-ephrinA1, and novel engineered peptide ligands. We used fluorescence intensity fluctuation (FIF) spectrometry to characterize the EphA2 oligomer populations induced by the different ligands. Interestingly, we found that different monomeric and dimeric ligands induce EphA2 oligomers with widely different size distributions. Our comparison of FIF brightness distribution parameters and EphA2 signaling parameters reveals that the efficacy of EphA2 phosphorylation on tyrosine 588, an autophosphorylation response contributing to EphA2 activation, correlates with EphA2 mean oligomer size. However, we found that other characteristics, such as the efficacy of AKT inhibition and ligand bias coefficients, appear to be independent of EphA2 oligomer size. Taken together, this work highlights the utility of FIF in RTK signaling research and demonstrates a quantitative correlation between the architecture of EphA2 signaling complexes and signaling features."
https://openalex.org/W4291110522,"The transcriptional regulator Taf14 is a component of multiple protein complexes involved in transcription initiation and chromatin remodeling in yeast cells. Although Taf14 is not required for cell viability, it becomes essential in conditions where the formation of the transcription preinitiation complex is hampered. The specific role of Taf14 in mediating transcription initiation and preinitiation complex formation is unclear. Here, we explored its role in the general transcription factor IID by mapping Taf14 genetic and proteomic interactions and found that it was needed for the function of the complex if Htz1, the yeast homolog of histone H2A.Z, was absent from chromatin. Dissecting the functional domains of Taf14 revealed that the linker region between the YEATS and ET domains was required for cell viability in the absence of Htz1 protein. We further show that the linker region of Taf14 interacts with DNA. We propose that providing additional DNA binding capacity might be a general role of Taf14 in the recruitment of protein complexes to DNA and chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W4291617514,"Eritrea has achieved the global target (90%) for tuberculosis (TB) treatment success rate. Though, events of unsuccessful TB treatment outcomes (death, treatment failure, lost to follow up and not evaluated) could lead to further TB transmission and the development of resistant strains. Hence, factors related to these events should be explored and addressed. This study aims to fill the gap in evidence by identifying the determinants of unsuccessful TB treatment outcomes in Eritrea's Northern Red Sea region.A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Eritrea's Northern Red Sea region. Data collected using a data extraction tool was analyzed using Stata version 13. Frequencies, proportions, median and standard deviations were used to describe the data. Furthermore, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to determine the risk factors for unsuccessful TB treatment outcomes. Crude odds ratio (COR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) presented and p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Among 1227 TB patients included in this study, 9.6% had unsuccessful TB treatment outcomes. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, TB cases 55-64 years old (AOR: 2.75[CI: 1.21-6.32], p = 0.016) and those ≥ 65 years old (AOR: 4.02[CI: 1.72-9.45], p = 0.001) had 2.7 and 4 times higher likelihood of unsuccessful TB treatment outcome respectively. In addition, HIV positive TB patients (AOR: 5.13[CI: 1.87-14.06], p = 0.002) were 5 times more likely to have unsuccessful TB treatment outcome.

https://openalex.org/W4291617516,"This paper contributes to current debates on the technologies and practices of prehistoric artists using the rock art site of el Carche (Jalance, Spain) as a case study. The site preserves both Levantine and Schematic paintings, yet poorly understood from an analytical point of view. In the past, it has even been argued how little differentiation there is between these two post-Paleolithic traditions in terms of paint composition. Our aim with this paper was to identify pigments, paint recipes and technologies and decipher the order of the superimpositions, both between Levantine motifs of different styles, and between these and the Schematic ones. To do so, we adopted a multi-stage and multi-technical analytical strategy, trying to find a balance between sound scientific investigation and impact on the art, considering the irreplaceable nature of this World Heritage rock art. As such, our approach begins with in situ non-invasive investigations using portable EDXRF, to then collect micro-samples for non-destructive analyses by means of Optical Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), micro-Raman Spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). One of the key highlights of these paper is the identification of up to four different paint compositions, produced with various hematite-based raw materials and different processing techniques. This variability had not been previously documented. Interestingly though, no direct correlations appear to exist between styles or sub-styles and recipes. Some of these paint mixtures were even shared by both traditions. These results are discussed in cultural terms, challenging previous interpretations suggesting a similar pigment composition between Levantine and Schematic art. Microstratigraphic analysis of the cross-sections only partially clarified the overlapping sequence unveiling the complexity of these analysis. They also revealed several degradation layers and external crusts related to rock alteration processes and biological formations. Their role in rock art conservation is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4291907546,"Background People aged 80 and over frequently face complex chronic conditions and health limitations, including oral health problems, which are primarily addressed by ambulatory (i.e., outpatient) healthcare. This demographic development is expected to affect the provision of care. However, few studies have investigated physicians’ and dentists’ views across the various medical disciplines in non-institutional settings. This study investigated how healthcare providers perceive caring for very old people, and how they feel healthcare should be designed for this patient group. Methods A qualitative online survey comprising nine open-ended items was conducted among physicians and dentists practicing in the ambulatory healthcare sector in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Apart from child and adolescent healthcare, no medical specialties were excluded. The results were analysed using Kuckartz’ approach of structuring qualitative content analysis. A descriptive codebook was developed first. After coding all the material, recurring patterns between the topics were investigated and compared between two groups of participants, physicians and dentists. Results N = 77 cases were included in the analysis, from which n = 21 originated from the field of ambulatory general practice care and internal medicine, n = 19 from specialties (e.g., neurology, urology), and n = 37 from dentistry. Caring for patients aged 80 and over was perceived as challenging because of complex health conditions and treatments such as multimorbidity and polypharmacy, and patients’ cognitive and physical limitations. In characterizing good care in older age, both groups found individual care important, as well as empathetic interactions and good collaboration in networks of healthcare providers. Inadequate reimbursement and limited resources and time were the most important barriers to providing good care, while one of the most important facilitators was healthcare providers’ attitude and motivation. Conclusions Physicians’ and dentists’ conceptions of good healthcare are in line with the conceptualization of patient-centred care. However, the transfer in everyday care delivery is hampered by the current design of healthcare structures. Healthcare providers feel overstrained by the increasing demands placed on them. Adaptations for improvement should focus on building strong networks of cooperating health professions, especially including dental care, and local social support structures."
https://openalex.org/W4291110447,"Biosynthesis of riboflavin (RF), the precursor of the redox cofactors FMN and FAD, was thought to be well understood in bacteria, with all the pathway enzymes presumed to be known and essential. Our previous research has challenged this view by showing that, in the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, deletion of the ribBA gene encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps on the RF biosynthesis pathway only causes a reduction in flavin secretion rather than RF auxotrophy. This finding led us to hypothesize that RibBA participates in the biosynthesis of flavins destined for secretion, whereas S. meliloti has another enzyme that performs this function for internal cellular metabolism. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize a novel formamidase (SMc02977) involved in the production of RF for intracellular functions in S. meliloti. This catalyst, which we named Sm-BrbF, releases formate from the early RF precursor 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate to yield 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate. We show that homologs of this enzyme are present in many bacteria, are highly abundant in the Rhizobiales order, and that sequence homologs from Brucella abortus and Liberobacter solanacearum complement the RF auxotrophy of the Sm1021ΔSMc02977 mutant. Furthermore, we show that the B. abortus enzyme (Bab2_0247, Ba-BrbF) is also an 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate formamidase, and that the bab2_0247 mutant is a RF auxotroph exhibiting a lower level of intracellular infection than the wildtype strain. Finally, we show that Sm-BrbF and Ba-BrbF directly interact with other RF biosynthesis pathway enzymes. Together, our results provide novel insight into the intricacies of RF biosynthesis in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4291115661,"T cell signaling starts with assembling several tyrosine kinases and adapter proteins to the T cell receptor (TCR), following the antigen binding to the TCR. The stability of the TCR–antigen complex and the delay between the recruitment and activation of each kinase determines the T cell response. Integration of such delays constitutes a kinetic proofreading mechanism to regulate T cell response to the antigen binding. However, the mechanism of these delays is not fully understood. Combining biochemical experiments and kinetic modeling, here we report a thermodynamic brake in the regulatory module of the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70, which determines the ligand selectivity, and may delay the ZAP-70 activation upon antigen binding to TCR. The regulatory module of ZAP-70 comprises of a tandem SH2 domain that binds to its ligand, doubly-phosphorylated ITAM peptide (ITAM-Y2P), in two kinetic steps: a fast step and a slow step. We show the initial encounter complex formation between the ITAM-Y2P and tandem SH2 domain follows a fast-kinetic step, whereas the conformational transition to the holo-state follows a slow-kinetic step. We further observed a thermodynamic penalty imposed during the second phosphate-binding event reduces the rate of structural transition to the holo-state. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the evolution of the thermodynamic brake coincides with the divergence of the adaptive immune system to the cell-mediated and humoral responses. In addition, the paralogous kinase Syk expressed in B cells does not possess such a functional thermodynamic brake, which may explain the higher basal activation and lack of ligand selectivity in Syk.

Each recruitment step introduces a delay between the ligand binding and activation of the enzyme. The nonspecific interaction between self-antigen and TCR is short-lived and does not signal because the antigen–TCR complex dismantles before the activation of the downstream kinases. The interactions arising from foreign antigens are long-lived and get enough time to signal by activating the kinases. Paralogous kinases mediating the early events in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling of the humoral immune response employ conceptually similar mechanisms (10Mocsai A. Ruland J. Tybulewicz V.L.

The regulatory module is made up of tandem Src homology 2 (tSH2) domains connected by a helical linker called interdomain A (Fig. 1, A and C). In the inactive state (apo-state), the two SH2 domains adopt an ‘L’-like open conformation making them incompatible to ligand binding (Fig. 1C) (15Deindl S. Kadlecek T.A. Brdicka T. Cao X. Weiss A.

Despite the high sequence homology with Syk, it is not understood why the tSH2 domain of ZAP-70 could not adopt a stable closed conformation in the apo-state. It is also not clear why does ZAP-70 display a delayed Ca2+ response upon activation compared to Syk (12Sadras T. Martin M. Kume K. Robinson M.E. Saravanakumar S.

Moreover, the tSH2 domain of ZAP-70 binds in a biphasic manner with a high degree of selectivity to a conserved ITAM-Y2P sequence (33Gangopadhyay K. Manna B. Roy S. Kumari S. Debnath O.

The mechanism and functional significance of biphasic ligand binding for T cell signaling remains unclear. We present a kinetic model from a comparative study of the tSH2 domain of ZAP-70 and Syk that explains the differential ligand binding. We observed that the tSH2 domain of ZAP-70 binds to ITAM-Y2P in two-step kinetics, fast and slow, compared to one-step binding in Syk. The slow binding to the ZAP-70 tSH2 domain arises from a thermodynamic penalty (brake) that determines the ligand selectivity and biases the conformational equilibrium of the apo-tSH2 domain toward the open conformation. Conversely, such thermodynamic break is nonfunctional in Syk tSH2-domain. Phylogenetic mapping shows that the emergence of the thermodynamic brake coincides with the evolution of the BCR-TCR-MHC like immune system at the divergence of jawless and jawed fish approximately 500 million years ago (37Flajnik M.F. Kasahara M. Origin and evolution of the adaptive immune system: genetic events and selective pressures.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The ZAP-70 tSH2 domain binding to the doubly phosphorylated ITAM-ζ1 peptide (ITAM-Y2P-ζ1) produces a biphasic curve with three distinct dissociation constants, Kd1, Kd2, and Kd1∗ (Fig. 1, B–D) (33Gangopadhyay K. Manna B. Roy S. Kumari S. Debnath O. Chowdhury S. et al.An allosteric hot spot in the tandem-SH2 domain of ZAP-70 regulates T-cell signaling.Biochem. J. 2020; 477: 1287-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). First, the N-terminal phosphotyrosine residue from ITAM-Y2P binds uncooperatively to the C-SH2 phosphate-binding pocket (PBP) with a low nanomolar affinity (Kd1) to form an encounter complex (Fig. 1, C–E). The formation of the tSH2:ITAM-Y2P encounter complex allows the assembly of the N-SH2 PBP. Subsequently, C-terminal phosphotyrosine residue from ITAM-Y2P binds weakly to the newly formed PBP with micromolar affinity (Kd2). In the steady-state, the two binding events are interlinked by a plateau (Fig. 1D). The second binding event remodels the C-SH2 PBP to an intermediate-binding pocket (Kd1∗) producing a hill-coefficient of 3.4 ± 0.36 (suggesting cooperative binding). It was reported previously, the tSH2-domain of ZAP-70 displays hierarchical preference in binding to different ITAM sequences (17Bu J.Y. Shaw A.S. Chan A.C.

We begin by asking which part of the biphasic binding isotherm, in the steady-state, is sensitive to the ITAM peptide sequence (Fig. 1B). We comparatively studied the binding of ITAM-Y2P-ζ3 to the tSH2 domain by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Figs. 1, B, D–E and S1, B–F). We probed Kd1 and Kd1∗ by fluorescence spectroscopy and Kd2 and Kd1∗ by ITC. To probe the Kd2, we used tSH2R190A mutant that impairs phosphotyrosine binding to C-SH2 PBP (Figs. 1E and S1F). We overserved that ITAM-Y2P-ζ3 binds weakly to the ZAP-70 tSH2 domain, compared to ITAM-Y2P-ζ1, consistent with the previous reports (17Bu J.Y. Shaw A.S. Chan A.C. Analysis of the interaction of ZAP-70 and Syk protein-tyrosine kinases with the T-cell antigen receptor by plasmon resonance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5106-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 41Love P.E. Hayes S.M. ITAM-mediated signaling by the T-cell antigen receptor.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a002485Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Our data revealed that the C-SH2 domain does not distinguish between the two ITAM-Y2P while forming the encounter complex. Both the peptides, ITAM-Y2P-ζ1 and ITAM-Y2P-ζ3, bind to the C-SH2 domain with low nanomolar affinity (Kd1) of 3.3 ± 0.5 nM and 6.8 ± 1.5 nM, respectively. However, we noted a significant increase in the plateau width for the ITAM-Y2P-ζ3 and tSH2 interaction (Fig. 1D). The ITAM-Y2P-ζ3 binding perturbed the Kd2 and Kd1∗ contributing to the overall increase in the dissociation constant (Fig. 1E). We ask why the plateau-width in the steady-state binding (Fig. 1D) is sensitive to the subtle changes in ligand type? We developed a multistep mathematical-kinetic model to explain the biphasic bindings of ITAM-Y2P and tSH2 domains. This model comprised of different tSH2 domain conformations, open and closed, connected by a complex network (Fig. 2, A and B). The tSH2-apo state (Ropen00) ultimately reaches the tSH2-holo state (Rclosed11) through different pathways associated with distinct rates. The receptor in the apo-state first converts to an encounter complex (Ropen01) and then adopts a closed conformation (Rclosed01). We also considered two other intermediates (Rclosed00 and Rclosed10) through which the final holo-state may form (see Experimental procedures). Based on our experimental dissociation constants, we assumed that the formation of the encounter complex is the fastest (Kd1=kbkf=3−10nM; Fig. 1E). To explain the biphasic binding (Fig. 1D), we further assumed that the transitions to the holo-state from the partially bound states (from Rclosed10 or Rclosed01 to Rclosed11) exhibit negative cooperativity. These steps represent kinetic penalties (42Sevlever F. Di Bella J.P. Ventura A.C. Discriminating between negative cooperativity and ligand binding to independent sites using pre-equilibrium properties of binding curves.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2020; 16e1007929Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and occur with much slower forward rates (w1kf and w2kf, with 0<wi<1 , i=1 or 2) with dissociation constants Kd2(=kb1w1kf) and Kd1∗ (= kb2w2kf), respectively. It may be noted that our model does not have any feedback regulation (43Das J. Ho M. Zikherman J. Govern C. Yang M. Weiss A. et al.Digital signaling and hysteresis characterize ras activation in lymphoid cells.Cell. 2009; 136: 337-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 44Angeli D.

Chowdhury S. et al.An allosteric hot spot in the tandem-SH2 domain of ZAP-70 regulates T-cell signaling.Biochem. J. 2020; 477: 1287-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We anticipate the variation in Kd1, Kd2, or Kd1∗ may determine the steady-state response. The model was analyzed numerically to calculate the ligand-bound fraction (Equations S1 and S2) and to predict the steady-state response and the kinetic behavior. In the steady-state, the Kd1 determines the receptor sensitivity (initial rising slopes of the bound fractions) in low ligand concentration regime (nM level) and also modulates the plateau width (Fig. 2C). The kinetic behavior mostly showed a single exponential decay except in a narrow intermediate range of Kd1 (around 8 nM – 20 nM), where a two-step decay was observed (Figs. 2, D and E and S2, A and B). Next, we assessed the effect of Kd2 (Fig. 1C) variation on the steady-state behavior by changing the penalty factor, w1 (associated with the transition from Rclosed01 to Rclosed11, Fig. 2B). The Kd2 variation modulated the ligand selectivity by altering the plateau width in the steady-state (Fig. 2F). With a higher penalty (equivalently lower w1 or higher Kd2), the plateau width became broader and displayed two-step kinetics with a sharp initial decay and a slow subsequent decrease of the unbound fraction. (Fig. 2, G and H). We asked, does a biphasic behavior in the steady-state arise due to slow transition of the partially-bound closed states (Rclosed01 or Rclosed10) to an open configuration. In our model, we introduced slow transition from Rclosed01 or Rclosed10 states to open configurations (Ropen01 or Ropen00,respectively) by varying the respective rates, at the same time without putting penalties on other steps (Kd2 and Kd1∗). None of the changes made produced any biphasic response in the steady-state (Fig. S2, E–H). In contrast, when we introduce slow transition from Rclosed01 or Rclosed10 to the final holo-state (Rclosed11), the steady-state responses become biphasic (Fig. S2, I–L). Thus, we conclude that the slow transitions (due to the penalty) from the Rclosed01 and Rclosed10 to the Rclosed11 determines the plateau behavior and not the slow relaxation of the close states to the open state. Since both the slow transition from the Rclosed01 or Rclosed10 states to the final holo-state (Rclosed11) could, in principle, lead to a biphasic response, we next asked which transition is more sensitive. We found that the variation of Kd1∗ marginally alters the plateau width in the steady-state (Fig. S2, C and D) (when we introduced penalties in the transitions from Rclosed10 and Rclosed01 to Rclosed11). Therefore, the slowest binding step to the N-SH2 PBP (Kd2) mainly controls the plateau width. This conclusion correlates with the observed Kd2, which is orders of magnitude lower than the Kd1 and Kd1∗ (Fig. 1E), suggesting the corresponding step may impart a significant penalty in the dynamic binding of the ligand. However, measurement of free energy change is necessary to determine if a thermodynamic cost manifests as a kinetic penalty, as elucidated in the model. Finally, for a particular set of parameter choices, the model prediction reasonably agreed with the experimental data of ITAM-Y2P-ζ1 and ITAM-Y2P-ζ3 bindings to the tSH2 domain (Fig. 2I). In the model, reported values of Kd1, Kd2, and Kd1∗ (Fig. 1E) were used for the quantitative matching, but other parameters were unknown and chosen arbitrarily to fit the data (Table S5). Since our model predicted two-step binding kinetics (Fig. 2, E and H), we next probed the binding kinetics of ITAM-Y2P-ζ1 or ITAM-Y2P-ζ3 to the tSH2 domain by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. We started with mixing excess ITAM-Y2P-ζ1 to the tSH2 domains at 10 °C and measured the change in tryptophan fluorescence intensity for 200 s (Fig. 3A). We observed that the fluorescence intensity decay in two steps, fast (<200 ms) and slow (>20 s) (Fig. 3A). Hence, we recorded all the kinetic experiments at two-time scales. All kinetic data were first normalized against the highest intensity and then subtracted by the blank (protein only sample) (Fig. 3, A and B) and fitted to a one-site association kinetics (Table 1).Table 1Observed rate for the ZAP-70 tSH2 domain and ITAM-Y2P bindingConstructkobsfast (s-1)kobsslow (s-1)tSH2:ITAM-Y2P-ζ123.87 ± 1.010.262 ± 0.0977tSH2:ITAM-Y2P-ζ321.44 ± 1.830.012 ± 0.0048tSH2 R39A:ITAM-Y2P-ζ124.82 ± 2.29---tSH2:ITAM-YP-ζ128.60 ± 5.84---tSH2: ITAM-Y2P-ζ1 E13A24.4 ± 2.040.022 ± 0.0045tSH2 F117A: ITAM-Y2P-ζ121.83 ± 1.490.0517 ± 0.0062tSH2 R43P: ITAM-Y2P-ζ127.96 ± 3.452.25 ± 0.032tSH2 R192A: ITAM-Y2P-ζ1---0.006 ± 0.002 Open table in a new tab We observed that the ITAM-Y2P-ζ1 binds to the tSH2 domain with two observed rates of kobsfast=23.87±1.01 s−1 and kobsslow=0.262±0.098 s−1 (Fig. 3, A, B and Table 1). Our mathematical model suggests that the fast-binding kinetic may arise (Fig. 2, E and H) during the formation of the encounter complex (Kd1). To test that, we turn to three samples, two mutants tSH2R39A and tSH2R192A that would prevent phosphotyrosine binding to N-SH2 and C-SH2 PBP, respectively. Third, a single phosphotyrosine ITAM-ζ1 peptide (ITAM-YP-ζ1) that will show only one binding event (Fig. 3C). The steady-state fluorescence titration of tSH2R39A to ITAM-Y2P-ζ1 and tSH2 domain to ITAM-YP-ζ1 showed that the first binding step is preserved with (Kd1) of 8 ± 1.05 nM and 3.7 ± 0.1 nM, respectively, and no subsequent binding was observed (Figs. 3C, S3, A and B). In the kinetics experiment, both the samples showed a kobsfast of 24.82 ± 2.29 s−1 and 28.60 ± 5.84 s−1, respectively, with no detectable slow binding (Fig. 3, D and E). Under substoichiometric ligand concentration, tSH2R192A did not bind to the ITAM-Y2P-ζ1(33) and showed a linear ligand binding at a higher ITAM-Y2P-ζ1 (μM) concentration (Fig. S3G). The tSH2R192A binds with a ten-fold slower kobsslow (0.006 ± 0.002 s−1) rate in comparison to the WT tSH2 domain (Table 1), with no detectable fast binding (Fig. 3, D and E). Together, our data indicates that the N-SH2 (R39A) and C-SH2 (R192A) mutants display only μM and nM affinity, respectively, suggesting that the formation of the encounter complex is critical for the subsequent ligand binding. To check if our proposed model (Fig. 2B) could explain the above data (Fig. 3, C–E), we introduced a modification in the model (Fig. 3F). The N-SH2 binding is almost absent in both cases, and the partially bound state does not transform to the"
https://openalex.org/W4291617783,"Scenario tools are widely used to support policymaking and strategic planning. Loss of biodiversity, climate change, and increase in biomass demand ways to project future forest resources considering e.g. various protection schemes, alterations to forest management, and potential threats like pests, wind, and drought. The European Forestry Dynamics Model (EFDM) is an area-based matrix model that can combine all these aspects in a scenario, simulating large-scale impacts. The inputs to the EFDM are the initial forest state and models for management activities such as thinning, felling or other silvicultural treatments. The results can be converted into user-defined outputs like wood volumes, the extent of old forests, dead wood, carbon, or harvest income. We present here a new implementation of the EFDM as an open-source R package. This new implementation enables the development of more complex scenarios than before, including transitions from even-aged forestry to continuous cover forestry, and changes in land use or tree species. Combined with a faster execution speed, the EFDM can now be used as a building block in optimization systems. The new user interface makes the EFDM more approachable and usable, and it can be combined with other models to study the impact of climate change, for example."

The aim of this study was to determine the degree to which marine herbivorous sea urchins, Mesocentrotus nudus, were contaminated with radiocesium because of the accident. We collected samples of sea urchins from four locations in Fukushima prefecture (at the coast and offshore from the Yotsukura and Ena stations) and investigated how the 137Cs activity concentrations changed. The biological half-life (Tbio) of 137Cs in the individual sea urchins was between 121 and 157 days. The ecological half-life (Teco) of 137Cs was 181-423 days and was high in places close to the FDNPP. The Teco values in the sea urchins were longer than previously reported. The results infer that the food sources of the sea urchins around the Fukushima coast strongly influenced their uptake of 137Cs."

Other fields that rely on surface manipulation, such as garment or prosthetic design, would also benefit from characterization of tissue surface mechanics. Eight homogeneous tissue models were developed for the upper and lower legs and arms of two donors. Ultrasound indentation data was used to drive an inverse finite element analysis for individualized determination of region-specific material coefficients for the lumped tissue. A novel calibration strategy was implemented by using a ratio based adjustment of tissue properties from linear regression of model predicted and experimental responses. This strategy reduced requirement of simulations to an average of under four iterations. These free and open-source specimen-specific models can serve as templates for simulations focused on mechanical manipulations of limb surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W4291618322,"MRI brain structure segmentation plays an important role in neuroimaging studies. Existing methods either spend much CPU time, require considerable annotated data, or fail in segmenting volumes with large deformation. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-atlas-based algorithm for 3D MRI brain structure segmentation. It consists of three modules: registration, atlas selection and label fusion. Both registration and label fusion leverage an integrated flow based on grayscale and SIFT features. We introduce an effective and efficient strategy for atlas selection by employing the accompanying energy generated in the registration step. A 3D sequential belief propagation method and a 3D coarse-to-fine flow matching approach are developed in both registration and label fusion modules. The proposed method is evaluated on five public datasets. The results show that it has the best performance in almost all the settings compared to competitive methods such as ANTs, Elastix, Learning to Rank and Joint Label Fusion. Moreover, our registration method is more than 7 times as efficient as that of ANTs SyN, while our label transfer method is 18 times faster than Joint Label Fusion in CPU time. The results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method is applicable to image pairs that require a significant transformation in registration. The performance on a composite dataset suggests that our method succeeds in a cross-modality manner. The results of this study show that the integrated 3D flow-based method is effective and efficient for brain structure segmentation. It also demonstrates the power of SIFT features, multi-atlas segmentation and classical machine learning algorithms for a medical image analysis task. The experimental results on public datasets show the proposed method's potential for general applicability in various brain structures and settings."

Interviews and focus groups were conducted with fourteen healthcare providers from four outpatient specialty clinics at an academic health system with an IHSSP. Qualitative analysis using an iterative inductive/deductive approach of coded transcripts was used to identify themes. Participants discussed requirements and barriers to communicating with insurance providers, drug manufacturers, and external pharmacies; time and effort required to navigate LDNs and impact on workload and clinic workflow; financial awareness of medication costs and methods for communication about financial information with patients; and advocating for patients to ensure access to necessary therapy and avoid missed doses or treatment lapse. Participants reported barriers to navigating LDNs that can interfere with clinic workflow and patient care. IHSSPs may reduce clinic burden by helping patients access, afford, and remain on therapy."

We investigated the effects of lumbar intrathecal morphine on locomotor function after mild thoracic SCI and the involvement of classic opioid receptor activation. A mild thoracic contusive SCI was induced in adult rats at the T9-T10 spine level under sevoflurane anesthesia. We evaluated the effects of single doses of intrathecal morphine and selective μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptor agonists, continuous infusion of intrathecal morphine for 72 hours, and administration of physiological saline on locomotor function and muscle tone in the hindlimbs. The numbers of damaged and total α-motoneurons in the lumbar spinal cord were also investigated. Single doses of morphine aggravated residual locomotor function after SCI but did not affect functional recovery. Single doses of morphine and μ- and δ-opioid receptor agonists significantly aggravated residual locomotor function with increases in muscle tone after SCI, and the effects of the drugs were reversed by naloxone. In contrast, continuous infusion of morphine led to persistent decline in locomotor function with increased muscle tone, which was not reversed by naloxone, but did not increase the number of damaged lumbar α-motoneurons. These results indicate that a single dose of morphine at an analgesic dose transiently increases muscle tone of the hindlimbs via activation of spinal μ- and δ- opioid receptors, resulting in further deterioration of locomotor function in the acute phase of mild SCI. Our results also suggest that an increased dose of morphine with prolonged administration leads to persistent decline in locomotor function with increased muscle tone via mechanisms other than direct activation of classical opioid receptors. Morphine should be used cautiously even after mild SCI."

One hundred two female university students (age, 20.1±1.0 years; height, 164.6±7.2 cm; mass, 58.9±7.3 kg) for whom RJ performance variables (RJ-index, jump height, and contact time) and joint kinetics (torque, power, and work) were measured. Statistical analysis showed a strong correlation between the RJ-index and jump height or contact time (r = 0.920, -0.726, p &lt; 0.05) but a weak correlation between the jump height and contact time (r = -0.384, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, positive ankle power was the most influential factor for RJ performance variables; additionally, positive knee power and hip work and eccentric knee torque significantly influenced jump height, and positive ankle power, negative work and power, and concentric torque significantly influenced the contact time. The acquisition of the jump height and a shorter contact time requires different kinetic variables. Furthermore, the characteristics of the force exerted by the three joints of the lower limb that compose the RJ-index may be different even if the RJ-index has the same value. Therefore, by assessing not only the RJ-index but also the jump height, contact time, and characteristics of lower limb joint kinetics in the RJ test, it is possible to conduct effective training to improve lower limb SSC motor execution performance according to individual characteristics."

Secondly, based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) method, a novel feature selection method named L-SFS is proposed. And then, the softmax regression model is used to learn automatically the weights of the four single weak learners including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and LightGBM. Lastly, based on the learned automatically weights and the weighted average probability voting strategy, an ensemble classification model named Sklex is constructed, which integrates the above four single weak learners. In conclusion, the method reflects the effectiveness of feature construction and the superiority and stability of ensemble learning, and gets good speech emotion recognition accuracy."

This study aimed to assess the relation of hypertension and other factors to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients discharged from Eka Kotebe Hospital in June-September, 2020. Methods This is a single-center case-control study of 265 adult patients discharged alive or dead, 75 with a course of severe COVID-19 for the cases arm and 190 with the non-severe disease for the control arm. Three age and sex-matched controls were selected randomly for each patient on the case arm. Chi-square, multivariable binary logistic regression, and odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval was used to assess the association between the various factors and the severity of the disease. A p-value of &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. Results Of the 265 study participants, 80% were male. The median age was 43 IQR(36–60) years. Both arms had similar demographic characteristics. Hypertension was strongly associated with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia based on effect outcome adjustment (AOR = 2.93, 95% CI 1.489, 5.783, p-value = 0.002), similarly, having diabetes mellitus (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI 1.374, 7.313, p-value&lt;0.007), chronic cardiac disease (AOR = 4.803, 95% CI 1.238–18.636, p&lt;0.023), and an increase in a pulse rate (AOR = 1.041, 95% CI 1.017, 1.066, p-value = 0.001) were found to have a significant association with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions Hypertension was associated with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, and so were diabetes mellitus, chronic cardiac disease, and an increase in pulse rate."

To explicate the response of the eco-environment to rapid economic growth in the 14 contiguous areas of dire poverty in China, we developed a method of evaluating the impact of poverty alleviation policies on ecological health. Based on the yearly data of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2000 to 2019, the dynamic changes in NDVI and GDP were calculated, and the development patterns in the 14 contiguous areas of dire poverty were evaluated and classified. The results show that both annual GDP per capita and average annual NDVI exhibited an increasing trend, increasing by 43.81% and 0.84% per year, respectively. The development of the 14 contiguous areas of dire poverty all presented a coordinated and sustainable (A) development pattern during the period from 2000 to 2019. The consistency of economic and ecological health development between 2000 and 2013 was less than that between 2014 and 2019. Moreover, the result indicates that it is necessary to make timely adjustments to poverty alleviation strategies based on the positive consistency between economic growth and ecological health."
https://openalex.org/W4291110520,"Kidney disease often manifests with an increase in proteinuria, which can result from both glomerular and/or proximal tubule injury. The proximal tubules are the major site of protein and peptide endocytosis of the glomerular filtrate, and cubilin is the proximal tubule brush border membrane glycoprotein receptor that binds filtered albumin and initiates its processing in proximal tubules. Albumin also undergoes multiple modifications depending upon the physiologic state. We previously documented that carbamylated albumin had reduced cubilin binding, but the effects of cubilin modifications on binding albumin remain unclear. Here, we investigate the cubilin-albumin binding interaction to define the impact of cubilin glycosylation and map the key glycosylation sites while also targeting specific changes in a rat model of proteinuria. We identified a key Asn residue, N1285, that when glycosylated reduced albumin binding. In addition, we found a pH-induced conformation change may contribute to ligand release. To further define the albumin-cubilin binding site, we determined the solution structure of cubilin's albumin-binding domain, CUB7,8, using small-angle X-ray scattering and molecular modeling. We combined this information with mass spectrometry crosslinking experiments of CUB7,8 and albumin that provides a model of the key amino acids required for cubilin-albumin binding. Together, our data supports an important role for glycosylation in regulating the cubilin interaction with albumin, which is altered in proteinuria and provides new insight into the binding interface necessary for the cubilin-albumin interaction."

Anti-VEGF therapy has become the standard treatment for ocular angiogenic disorders in ophthalmological practice. However, there is emerging evidence that anti-VEGF treatment may increase the risk of atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is important for the homeostasis of retinal tissue. Whereas the cytoprotective role of VEGF family molecules, particularly that of VEGF A (VEGFA) through its receptor VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), has been recognized, the physiological role of PlGF in the retina is still unknown. In this study, we explored the role of PlGF in the RPE using PlGF-knockdown RPE cells generated by retrovirus-based PlGF-shRNA transduction. We show that VEGFA reduced apoptosis induced by serum starvation in RPE cells, whereas the antiapoptotic effect of VEGFA was abrogated by VEGFR-2 knockdown. Furthermore, PlGF knockdown increased serum starvation-induced cell apoptosis and unexpectedly reduced the protein level of VEGFR-2 in the RPE. The antiapoptotic effect of VEGFA was also diminished in PlGF-knockdown RPE cells. In addition, we found that glycogen synthase kinase 3 activity was involved in proteasomal degradation of VEGFR-2 in RPE cells and inactivated by PlGF via AKT phosphorylation. Overall, the present data demonstrate that PlGF is crucial for RPE cell viability and that PlGF supports VEGFA/VEGFR-2 signaling by stabilizing the VEGFR-2 protein levels through glycogen synthase kinase 3 inactivation."

Objective This study explored the specific experiences of persons who were infected with COVID-19, but have recovered completely. A secondary objective was to identify essential elements in the lived experiences of such persons, which would be useful in designing appropriate policies and programs for managing the virus in Nigeria. Method The data were collected using in-depth interviews with 21 persons who were diagnosed with the virus and recovered. The data were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively using NVivo software. The experiences of the survivors of COVID-19 were examined under six themes: compliance with prevention measures before being infected, perceptions on how they contracted the virus, the symptoms they experienced, the management of the disease, their experiences with the healthcare system, their emotional experiences, and their recommendations on specific strategies to prevent and manage the virus based on their experiences. Results The commonly perceived means of contracting the virus were through colleagues, patients, and friends who were infected. The most commonly experienced symptoms were anosmia and fever. The health providers were described as courteous but some of the respondents observed avoidance and fear. Not all the interviewees knew the drugs they were treated with, but some, particularly the medical personnel, identified hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, vitamin C, Augmentin, among others. Some of the participants used herbal remedies. While some respondents recounted good experiences in the isolation centre, others had unpleasant experiences. Direct and indirect encounters which were perceived as stigmatizing and discriminatory were reported by some respondents. Conclusion We conclude that persons who recovered from COVID-19 in Nigeria had varied experiences relating to the mode of infection, the clinical features, methods of treatment, and psychosocial effects of the virus. These experiences would be useful for designing and implementing appropriate interventions, policies, and programs for managing the pandemic in the country."

We created high-resolution μCT-image series through the otic region of the skulls, used 3D-reconstruction software for rendering anatomical models, and compared the anatomy of the semicircular ducts, sacculus and ampullae of wildtype Python regius (ball python) with spider morph snakes. All spider morph snakes showed the wobble condition (i.e., twisting movements of the head, impaired locomotion, difficulty striking or constricting prey items). We describe the inner ear structures in wildtype and spider morph snakes and report a deviant morphology of semicircular canals, ampullae and sacculus in the latter. We also report about associated differences in the desmal skull bones of spider morph snakes, which were characterized by wider semicircular canals, ampullae widened and difficult to discern in μCT, a deformed crus communis, and a small sacculus with a highly deviant X-ray morphology as compared to wildtype individuals. We observed considerable intra- and interindividual variability of these features. This deviant morphology in spider morph snakes could easily be associated with an impairment of sense of equilibrium and the observed neurological wobble condition. Limitations in sample size prevent statistical analyses, but the anatomical evidence is strong enough to support an association between the wobble condition and a malformation of the inner ear structures. A link between artificially selected alterations in pattern and specific color design with neural-crest associated developmental malformations of the statoacoustic organ as known from other vertebrates is discussed."

We aimed to characterize the DRPs in a pharmacist-managed AC, identify the factors associated with the solved status of DRPs, and analyze the secondary outcomes, including the safety and efficacy of AC service. The patients receiving services at a pharmacist-managed AC in a medical center for the first time from March 2019 to August 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. The DRPs were retrieved from a self-developed Intelligent AC Service System and classified according to the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe Foundation v9.0 classification system. Logistic regression models were performed to identify the potential factors associated with the solved status of DRPs. A total of 78 direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and 34 warfarin users were included. The major types of DRPs identified at the initial service were adverse drug events (ADEs) (68.4%) and untreated symptoms or indications (14.8%) in the DOAC group, and ADEs (51.6%) and suboptimal effect of drug treatment (38.7%) in the warfarin group. The rates of totally solved DRPs were 56.8% and 51.6% in the DOAC and warfarin groups, respectively. According to the multivariable analysis, receiving AC services 3 times or more in 180 days (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.30-7.44) was associated with the totally solved status of DRPs in the DOAC group, but no relevant factor was identified in the warfarin group. The secondary outcomes showed that DOAC users demonstrated fewer thromboembolism events, major bleeding, and bleeding-related hospitalizations after AC services, whereas the warfarin users increased percentage time in therapeutic range (TTR% 55.0% vs. 74.6%, P = 0.006) after AC services.

We find that process-oriented patents draw more on previous knowledge, are more original and more radical than product patents. Lower breadth of protection is positively associated with pure process patenting, whereas product and mixed variants can be protected more broadly. This characterisation uncovers heterogeneity of patented inventions that allows for a more sophisticated use of patent statistics.

Although Orchidaceae is a group with high adaptability, they have become endangered for complex and various reasons such as the germination? difficulty and habitat loss, which makes it difficult to develop an accurate protection strategy. Phaius flavus is a terrestrial orchid which used to be widely distributed in central and southern Asia; however, large populations are difficult to find in the wild. Thus, the aim of this study was to provide a new perspective for conserving endangered P . flavus by investigating the mechanisms of its population decline; we established time-specific life and fertility tables, age pyramids, survival curves, and mortality curves for this plant and then conducted Leslie matrix model. We found that both of the populations from Wuhu Mount (WM) and Luohan Mount (LM) showed declining trends and exhibited pot-shaped age pyramids, low net reproductive rates, and negative intrinsic growth rates. The population from the Beikengding Mount (BM) showed a stable status with a bell-shaped age pyramid. However, it has a significant risk of decline because of the low net reproductive rate and intrinsic growth rate. This study use time-specific life and fertility tables, age pyramids, survival curves, and mortality curves, showed that the population decline of P . flavus could be attributed to 1) the shortage of seedlings caused by the low germination rate in the wild and 2) the loss of adult individuals caused by anthropogenic disturbances. To protect this species from extinction in these areas, we suggest that human activities in these habitats should be strictly forbidden and ex situ conservation of this plant in botanical gardens is also necessary."

Here we investigate the effects of Ca on water soaking. Fruit was incubated in solutions of various Ca salts and the extent of water soaking quantified using a simple rating scheme. Exposure to CaCl 2 (10 mM) decreased water soaking and anthocyanin leakage but had no effect on water uptake. The decrease in water soaking due to CaCl 2 was not limited to a single cultivar but occurred in all cultivars examined. Incubating fruit in a chelating agent (EGTA) increased water soaking compared to the water control. Calcium salts of different acids varied in their effects on water soaking. Only CaCl 2 reduced water soaking significantly. The chlorides of different cations, also varied in their effects on water soaking. Those of the monovalent cations had no effects on water soaking, while those of the divalent cations (CaCl 2 , BaCl 2 and SrCl 2 ) and of the trivalent cations (FeCl 3 and AlCl 3 ) were all effective in decreasing water soaking. Overall, CaCl 2 decreased microcracking of the strawberry cuticle as compared to deionized water. Furthermore, CaCl 2 also reduced the leakage of anthocyanins from flesh discs, irrespective of the osmotic potential of the incubation solution. Our results indicate that CaCl 2 reduced water soaking by decreasing cuticular microcracking, by decreasing leakage of plasma membranes and, possibly, by increasing the crosslinking of cell wall constituents."

Tanzania implemented Star Rating Assessment (SRA) of primary health care (PHC) facilities in 2015/16 and 2017/18 using SRA tools with 12 service areas. This paper assesses the status of service area 7, namely client focus that checked if client was satisfied with services provided and implementation of CSC through three indicators–if: CSC was displayed; CSC was monitored; client feedback mechanism and complaints handling was in place. Methods We extracted and performed a cross-sectional secondary data analysis of data related to clients’ focus that are found in national SRA database of 2017/2018 using STATA version 15. Client satisfaction was regarded as dependent variable while facility characteristics plus three indicators of CSC as independent variables. Multivariate logistic regression with p-value of 5% and 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied. Results A total of 4,523 facilities met our inclusion criteria; 3,987 (88.2%) were dispensaries, 408 (9.0%) health centres and 128 (2.8%) hospitals. CSC was displayed in 69.1% facilities, monitored in 32.4% facilities, and 32.5% of the facilities had mechanisms for clients’ feedback and handling complaints. The overall prevalence of clients’ satisfaction was 72.8%. Clients’ satisfaction was strongly associated with all implementation indicators of CSC. Clients from urban-based facilities had 21% increased satisfaction compared rural-based facilities (AOR 1.21; 95%CI: 1.00–1.46); and clients from hospitals had 39% increased satisfaction compared to dispensaries (AOR 1.39; 95%CI: 1.10–1.77). Conclusion The implementation of CSC is low among Tanzanian PHC facilities. Clients are more satisfied if received healthcare services from facilities that display the charter, monitor its implementation, have mechanisms to obtain clients feedback and handle complaints. Clients’ satisfaction at PHC could be improved through adoption and implementation of CSC."
https://openalex.org/W4291618085,"Pakistan's power sector has undergone extensive reforms to improve its technical and monetary performance over the last two decades. However, despite its fast-growing and hazardous nature, safety research remains limited in this context. This study aims to address this gap by assessing the level of safety climate in the power sector and comparing the safety climate in plants operated by multinational companies (MNCs) and local companies (LCs).To this end, five power plants operating in the southern part of the Punjab region (in Pakistan) were included in this study. The Nordic Occupational Safety Climate Questionnaire (NOSACQ-50), an analytical tool comprising of 50 items across seven dimensions, was used to determine the level of safety climate. An independent T-Test was then applied to compare the means in two different setups to draw a conclusion about overall safety climate differences. In MNCs, overall management/leadership perception improved; however, workers in both setups responded similarly in many cases. The lowest observed score in both setups was related to worker's prioritization of safety and risk non-acceptance. The study highlights the importance of a company's policies, procedures, and leadership commitments in creating a stronger safety climate by instilling trust in workers. The study further demonstrates that cross-cultural and strong policies devised by multinational companies help to improve the overall safety climate andconcludes that promoting an efficient and positive safety climate in the power sector is a long journey and that can only be achieved if all workers and leaders take on an active role."
https://openalex.org/W4291618139,"Inhaler technique errors are common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment, potentially leading to poor disease management. Our pooled analysis approach assessed correct use and ease-of-use of a placebo ELLIPTA dry-powder inhaler (DPI) in patients with COPD.Adults with COPD from open-label/non-blinded studies evaluating a placebo ELLIPTA DPI and reporting outcomes of correct use (based on the ELLIPTA DPI patient information leaflet [PIL]) and/or ease-of-use were included. Correct use and ease-of use at study end were primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. Data from patients in the placebo ELLIPTA DPI arm of each study were pooled, and the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was used for all analyses.Four placebo ELLIPTA DPI studies, reporting correct use (n = 4) and ease-of-use (n = 2), were included in the analysis. The ITT population comprised 1232 patients (mean age 66.2 years). For the primary endpoint, 80.1% (n = 975/1217) of patients demonstrated correct use at study end (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.8%-82.3%). For the secondary endpoint, 95.7% (n = 797/833) of patients rated placebo ELLIPTA DPI use ""easy""/""very easy"" at study end (95% CI: 94.1%-97.0%). Correct use and ""easy""/""very easy"" user ratings remained high across younger (40-64 years) and older (≥65 years) age groups.Across age groups, most patients used the placebo ELLIPTA DPI correctly and rated it ""easy""/""very easy"" to use. Consistent with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2021 report, our findings emphasize that proper training and clear instructions on PILs are important for optimal inhaler use."
https://openalex.org/W4291798827,"Personal narratives make up more than half of children's conversations. The ability to share personal narratives helps build and maintain friendships, promotes physical and emotional wellbeing, supports classroom participation, and underpins academic success and vocational outcomes. Although personal narratives are a universal discourse genre, cross-cultural and cross-linguistic research into children's ability to share personal narratives is in its infancy. The current study addresses this gap in the research by developing the Global TALES protocol, a protocol comprising six scripted prompts for eliciting personal narratives in school-age children (excited, worried, annoyed, proud, problem situation, something important). We evaluated its feasibility with 249 ten-year-old children from 10 different countries, speaking 8 different languages, and analyzed researchers' views on the process of adapting the protocol for use in their own country/language. At group-level, the protocol elicited discourse samples from all children, although individual variability was evident, with most children providing responses to all six prompts. When investigating the topics of children's personal narratives in response to the prompts, we found that children from around the world share many commonalities regarding topics of conversation. Once again individual variability was high, indicating the protocol is effective in prompting children to share their past personal experiences without forcing them to focus on one particular topic. Feedback from the participating researchers on the use of the protocol in their own countries was generally positive, although several translation issues were noted. Based on our results, we now invite clinical researchers from around the world to join us in conducting further research into this important area of practice to obtain a better understanding of the development of personal narratives from children across different languages and cultures and to begin to establish local benchmarks of performance."
https://openalex.org/W4291800635,"Purpose While plastic surgeons have been historically indispensable in reconstruction of posttraumatic defects, their role in Level I trauma centers around the world has not yet been clearly approved. This study aims to assess the contribution of plastic surgeons in major trauma care by evaluating the characteristics of trauma patients underwent plastic surgery at a Level I trauma center. Method From November 2014 to October 2020, we conducted a retrospective review of our hospital’s Trauma Registry System for patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 9 or higher. Of all of 7174 patients, the plastic surgery (PS) department treated 870 patients; the 6304 patients not treated by the PS were classified as the Non-PS. Then, we performed propensity score matching to reduce the statistical bias, after the death in the emergency room and the missing value were considered exclusion criteria. Result The mean ISS showed no significant difference between two groups (16.29 ± 7.04 in the PS vs. 16.68 ± 9.16 in the Non-PS, p = 0.3221). According to investigate the Abbreviated Injury Scale, both head and neck (65.0%) and face (46.4%) categories showed significantly higher in the PS group than the Non-PS group ( p &lt; 0.0001), and its contribution ratio was 2.151 and 21.822 times, respectively. Conclusion This study revealed the specialty of plastic surgery was face area in trauma care. We thus argue that plastic surgical care is imperative for trauma patients, and expect to be implicated in trauma system planning."
https://openalex.org/W4291800869,"Background and aim Globally, 12.8 million children have vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error (URE). In Mongolia, one in five children needs but do not have access to spectacles. This pilot cost-benefit analysis aims to estimate the net benefits of a children’s spectacles reimbursement scheme in Mongolia. Methods A willingness-to-pay (WTP) survey using the contingent valuation method was administered to rural and urban Mongolia respondents. The survey assessed WTP in additional annual taxes for any child with refractive error to be provided government-subsidised spectacles. Net benefits were then calculated based on mean WTP (i.e. benefit) and cost of spectacles. Results The survey recruited 50 respondents (mean age 40.2 ± 9.86 years; 78.0% women; 100% response rate) from rural and urban Mongolia. Mean WTP was US$24.00 ± 5.15 (95% CI US$22.55 to 25.35). The average cost of a pair of spectacles in Mongolia is US$15.00. Subtracting the average cost of spectacles from mean WTP yielded a mean positive net benefit of US$9.00. Conclusion A spectacle reimbursement scheme is potentially a cost-effective intervention to address childhood vision impairment due to URE in Mongolia. These preliminary findings support the proposal of the inclusion of children’s spectacles into existing Social Health Insurance. A much larger random sample could be employed in future research to increase the precision and generalisability of findings."
https://openalex.org/W4291801102,"Under climate change, the sea surface temperature and salinity change greatly, which poses a considerable threat to sustainable food security. Sea surface temperature and salinity (SST/SSS) are selected to examine the annual output of swimming crab in 24 cities along the eastern China. The Copula-based function was used to construct the probability distribution model of the swimming crab yield with SST and SSS. The pure premium rate of the swimming crab production in these 24 cities are also examined. The results show that 1) There is significant positive correlations between the yield of swimming crab with temperature and salinity over the study area. The only exception is that the correlation between yield of swimming crab and salinity is not significant in the south of study area. 2) The span of the pure insurance premium rate of swimming crab in 24 cities increases rapidly with the increase of the protection level, the maximum span up to 2.04%, and the minimum span is only 1.6%. 3) The distribution of the swimming crab insurance premium rate is various in space. The insurance premium rate of 8 cities in the south of Taizhou is low with the highest premium rate at 5.6%. The insurance premium rate of 16 cities in north of Taizhou is relatively high with the rate between 6%-22%. The research can provide a theoretical basis for the pricing of insurance products for swimming crab in 24 cities in the typical aquaculture areas in eastern China."
