Here, we investigate how the mechanisms by which creative teams self-assemble determine the structure of these collaboration networks. We propose a model for the self-assembly of creative teams that has its basis in three parameters: team size, the fraction of newcomers in new productions, and the tendency of incumbents to repeat previous collaborations. The model suggests that the emergence of a large connected community of practitioners can be described as a phase transition. We find that team assembly mechanisms determine both the structure of the collaboration network and team performance for teams derived from both artistic and scientific fields."

To date, there is little information about the potential role of H2S in inflammation. We have now investigated the part played by H2S in endotoxin-induced inflammation in the mouse. E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration produced a dose (10 and 20 mg/kg ip)- and time (6 and 24 h)-dependent increase in plasma H2S concentration. LPS (10 mg/kg ip, 6 h) increased plasma H2S concentration from 34.1 +/- 0.7 microM to 40.9 +/- 0.6 microM (n=6, P<0.05) while H2S formation from added L-cysteine was increased in both liver and kidney. CSE gene expression was also increased in both liver (94.2+/-2.7%, n=6, P<0.05) and kidney (77.5+/-3.2%, n=6, P<0.05). LPS injection also elevated lung (148.2+/-2.6%, n=6, P<0.05) and kidney (78.8+/-8.2%, n=6, P<0.05) myeloperoxidase (MPO, a marker of tissue neutrophil infiltration) activity alongside histological evidence of lung, liver, and kidney tissue inflammatory damage. Plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) concentration was additionally elevated in a time- and dose-dependent manner in LPS-injected animals. To examine directly the possible proinflammatory effect of H2S, mice were administered sodium hydrosulfide (H2S donor drug, 14 micromol/kg ip) that resulted in marked histological signs of lung inflammation, increased lung and liver MPO activity, and raised plasma TNF-alpha concentration (4.6+/-1.4 ng/ml, n=6). In contrast, DL-propargylglycine (CSE inhibitor, 50 mg/kg ip), exhibited marked anti-inflammatory activity as evidenced by reduced lung and liver MPO activity, and ameliorated lung and liver tissue damage. In separate experiments, we also detected significantly higher (150.5+/-43.7 microM c.f. 43.8+/-5.1 microM, n=5, P<0.05) plasma H2S levels in humans with septic shock. These findings suggest that H2S exhibits proinflammatory activity in endotoxic shock and suggest a new approach to the development of novel drugs for this condition."

PV hematopoietic progenitor cells exhibit hypersensitivity to growth factors and cytokines, suggesting possible abnormalities in protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases.

Blood. 2002; 100: 4272-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). It mainly affects people between 40 and 60 years of age with an annual incidence of about 14 per million in the population. Thus far there is no effective cure for the disease. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment for the disease, and hydroxyurea, interferon-α, and anagrelide drug therapies and 32P radiation therapy have commonly been used (3Spivak J.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4272-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The mortality rate is high if the disease is untreated or is associated with leukemia. Despite extensive studies in recent years, the molecular etiology of PV remains unknown.A major feature of PV is that hematopoietic progenitors in patients display hypersensitive responses to many growth factors and cytokines (1Green A.R. Lancet. 1996; 347: 844-845Abstract PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2Prchal J.F. Prchal J.T. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Spivak J.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4272-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Despite these abnormal responses, the numbers of receptors for the growth factors and cytokines on the surface of these cells are normal, suggesting a primary defect in a shared signaling pathway in these cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation is a fundamental regulatory mechanism for cell growth and development, and this process is controlled by coordinate actions of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs) (4Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). Both families of enzymes have highly diverse structures and functions. Their activities are tightly regulated under normal conditions, and deregulation of the enzymes produces human diseases. According to the human genomic data base, there are about 90 PTKs and 38 phosphotyrosine-specific PTPs (5Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 8-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Both mutation of PTKs and PTPs have been implicated in human cancers. Recent studies using a large scale sequencing-based approach revealed that PTK and PTP genes are mutated more often in human cancers than previously anticipated. A minimum of 30% of colorectal cancers contains at least one mutation in PTKs, and 26% of them has a mutation in PTPs (8Bardelli A. Parsons D.W. Silliman N. Ptak J. Szabo S. Saha S. Markowitz S.

Science. 2004; 304: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). It is highly expected that mutations of PTKs and PTPs may also be a major manifestation of other types of malignancies such as PV.In earlier studies, we found that PV erythroid progenitor cells contain a hyperactive PTP that corresponds to PTP-MEG2 (10Sui X. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z. Blood. 1997; 90: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Xu M.J. Sui X. Zhao R. Dai C. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. Blood. 2003; 102: 4354-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, this abnormality is caused by altered distribution of the enzyme rather than a mutation in its primary structure, suggesting that PTP-MEG2 is not the primary cause of the disease. Considering the general importance PTKs and PTPs and the feature of PV hematopoietic progenitor cells, we have performed a large scale DNA sequencing analysis of a number of candidate PTPs and PTKs. Here we report the identification of a JAK2 mutation in a majority of the PV samples. We have further demonstrated the JAK2 mutant has a gain-of-function feature.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Polyclonal antibodies against JAK2 and the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies against regular and phosphorylated forms of STAT5, ERK1/2, and Akt were from Cell Signaling Technology. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers and PV patients. Approval was obtained from the Vanderbilt University institutional review board for these studies. All of the PV patients met the established criteria for PV (3Spivak J.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4272-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The blood samples (usually 10 ml for isolation of mononuclear cells and 400 ml for purification of erythroid colony-forming cells) were collected in heparin at a final concentration of 20 units/ml. Light density mononuclear cells were collected by centrifugation on Ficoll (1.077 g/ml) following the standard protocol. Erythroid colony-forming cells were purified as described previously (10Sui X. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z. Blood. 1997; 90: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).PCR and Sequencing Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and erythroid colony-forming cells by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and genomic DNAs were extracted by phenol/chloroform after proteinase K digestion following standard techniques. First strand cDNAs were prepared by reverse transcription of total RNAs with random primers. For amplification of the JAK2 cDNA, the primers used were 5′-CCTCCCGCGACGGCAAATGTTCT-3′ and 5′-CTTTGTTCTGTAAATCTACTTTGGTCTCAG-3′ for initial PCR and 5′-TGCATGGGAATGGCCTGCCTTAC-3′ and 5′-CTTTCATCCAGCCATGTTATCCCTTA-3′ for nested PCR. For amplification of the JAK2 genomic DNA, the PCR primers were 5′-TCTTGTTCCTACTTCGTTCTCCATC-3′ and 5′TATTGTTTGGGCATTGTAACCTTCT-3′, which cover exons 13 and 14 of the JAK2 gene. PCR was performed with high fidelity DNA polymerase Pfu-ultra (Stratagene) or Phusion (MJ Bioworks, Inc.). The PCR products were purified from agarose gels and sequenced directly using the ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center.JAK2 Activity Assays—To make a substrate for JAK kinase activity assays, we expressed a GST fusion protein containing a peptide segment corresponding to amino acid residues 883–1132 at the C-terminal end of JAK2. This portion of JAK2 contains the autophosphorylation sites Tyr1007 and Tyr1008. The fusion protein, designated GST-JAK2CT, was purified from Escherichia coli cells by using glutathione-Sepharose columns. Wild type JAK2 and the JAK2V617F mutant were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) for expression in HeLa cells. Upon transfection with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The JAK2 and JAK2V617F enzymes were immunopurified from the cell extracts by using anti-JAK2 antibodies immobilized on agarose. The kinase assay system contained JAK2 immunoprecipitates, 0.1 mg/ml GST-JAK2CT, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 20 min and then stopped by addition of the SDS gel sample buffer. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-JAK2CT was determined by Western blotting analysis with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.Co-expression of JAK2 and JAK2V617F with EPOR and EPO Signaling Assays—HeLa cells were co-transfected with pRc/CMV-EPOR and pcDNA3-JAK2 or pcDNA3-JAK2V617F in the presence of the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. After 40 h, the cells were serum-starved for 4 h and then treated with 40 units/ml EPO (Amgen) for different time periods. The stimulation was stopped by washing the cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were extracted as described above. For Western blotting analyses, protein extracts containing equal amounts of total proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with various primary antibodies that were detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.RESULTSIdentification of a JAK2 Mutation in PV—Initially, we hypothesized that PV might be caused by mutations of PTKs and/or PTPs. To identify the mutations, our basic strategy was to sequence the entire coding regions of a number of PTPs and PTKs selected based on their known involvement in erythropoiesis. For PTPs, we analyzed SHP-1, SHP-2, TC-PTP, RPTPα, DEP, PTP-MEG1, PTP-MEG2, and CD45. These are the major PTPs identified in erythroid colony-forming cells (11Xu M.J. Sui X. Zhao R. Dai C. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. Blood. 2003; 102: 4354-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For PTKs, we chose members of the Src, Abl, JAK, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor families. We isolated total RNAs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified erythroid colony-forming cells. Upon synthesis of first strand cDNAs by reverse transcription, PCR was performed with primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding regions of candidate PTPs and PTKs. For samples that failed to yield products in the first PCR, nested PCR was performed with a set of inner primers. To avoid mutations caused by PCR amplifications, high fidelity DNA polymerases (Pfu-ultra and Phusion) were used. Complete sequencing analyses of the PCR products revealed sporadic single nucleotide polymorphisms, point mutations, and abnormal splicing of several PTPs and PTKs (not shown) and, most importantly, defined a point mutation of JAK2 in the majority of PV samples (Fig. 1). The JAK2 mutation is a G:C→ T:A transversion, WHICH causes substitution of Val617 by phenylalanine. At the cDNA level, we found mutations of JAK2 in 20 of 24 samples but not at all in 12 normal samples analyzed. In most cases, the mutation was heterozygous with varying proportions of the mutant JAK2 in the PCR products. In some cases, the mutant constituted only a small portion of the PCR products (∼15%, see PV1 in Fig. 1), whereas in three cases (e.g. PV4 in Fig. 1), nearly 100% of the PCR products corresponded to the mutant. The mutation is apparently not confined to erythroid progenitor cells, because no increase in the portion of mutant JAK2 was seen with RNAs isolated from purified erythroid colony-forming cells (data not shown), reflecting the multiple lineage feature of PV. Because the point mutation occurs somewhere in the middle of the JAK2 cDNA, it should not affect the efficiency of PCR amplification. Therefore, the ratio of wild type and mutant JAK2 PCR products should reflect the ratio of the wild type and mutant JAK2 mRNA in the original samples. We also analyzed the sequence of JAK2 at the genomic level. The mutation point is located at exon 14 of the JAK2 gene (the translation initiation codon is in exon 3). We designed PCR primers to amplify a fragment (1678 bp) of the gene covering exons 13 and 14 with an intron in between. Samples showing homozygous mutation of JAK2 at the cDNA level also gave rise to homozygous mutation with genomic DNAs. Interestingly, in all cases, the genomic DNA gave rise to significantly lower amounts of the mutant PCR products than the correspondent cDNA samples. In fact, several samples that showed low percentages of the JAK2 mutant in the PCR products with cDNAs produced hardly any mutant JAK2 PCR product with genomic DNAs (e.g. PV1 in Fig. 1). Apparently, analysis of cDNA is more sensitive in detecting the mutation of JAK2 in PV than in genomic DNAs. This is because not all hematopoietic cells express JAK2, and those expressing high levels of JAK2 mRNA are also affected by the mutant enzyme. These cells, bearing the mutant JAK2, presumably have gained an advantage to grow and thus give rise to more mRNA products without contributing much to the total genomic DNA in the blood. Altogether, the different degrees of mutation detected with both cDNAs and genomic DNAs indicate that the mutations of JAK2 in PV are not derived from germ lines but rather represent acquired events occurred in certain hematopoietic progenitor cells.Structural Analysis of the JAK2 Mutant—The structure of JAK family PTKs can be divided into seven JAK homology (JH) domains (12Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar, 13Ihle J.N. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 6: 1-35Google Scholar). Our sequence search of the GenBank™ data base by using the BLAST program revealed the presence of four major domains in JAK2 (Fig. 2). The C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain and pseudokinase domain correspond to the JH1 and JH2 domains, respectively. We also identified a putative SH2 domain that consists of the original JH3–JH4 region. SH2 domains bind specific tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs, but what the SH2 domain of JAK2 binds is not yet defined. The JH4–JH7 region constitutes the band 4.1 domain (also known as the FERM domain), which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (14Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 751-769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the catalytic domains of protein kinases consist of 12 subdomains with conserved key amino acid residues (15Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar, 16Hanks S.K. Genome Biol. 2003. 2003; 4: 111Google Scholar). The V617F mutation point resides in subdomain IV of the pseudokinase domain in the ATP binding lobe. The pseudokinase domain has the basic structural features of PTKs but has no catalytic activity. Growing evidence indicates that it regulates activities of the kinase domain. The pseudokinase domain suppressed basal JAK2 activity by lowering the Vmax of the kinase domain but does not affect the Km value; three inhibitory regions, namely IR1 (residues 619–670), IR2 (725–757), and IR3 (758–807), have been defined in the pseudokinase domain (17Saharinen P. Vihinen M. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Val617 is just N-terminal to the IR1, and it is conserved in JAK2 of various animals from fish, frog, bird, to mice. It is also conserved in human JAK1 and Tyk2 but is replaced by Met in JAK3. One can predict that the replacement of Val by Phe in JAK2 should cause major conformation changes. This may disrupt the inhibitory function of the pseudokinase domain and thus cause deregulation of the kinase domain. Earlier studies have shown that deletion of the pseudokinase domain leads to hyperactivation of JAK2. In fact, the Tel-JAK2 fusion protein with constitutive activation of its kinase domain causes myeloid and lymphoid malignancies (18Ward A.C. Touw I. Yoshimura A. Blood. 2000; 95: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the phenotype of PV disease, it is conceivable that JAK2V617F may be a gain-of-function mutant and have increased kinase activity.Fig. 2Structural analyses of the JAK2 mutant. Shown is a schematic structure of JAK2 together with the sequence alignment of the JAK family PTKs in the region where the V617F mutation (underlined) occurs in PV JAK2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)JAK2 Mutant Possesses Enhanced Kinase Activity and Causes Hyperactivation of Signaling Components Downstream of EPOR—To prove the potential gain-of-function feature of JAK2V617F, we compared the tyrosine kinase activity of wild type JAK2 and the mutant enzyme. Both the wild type and mutant enzymes were expressed in HeLa cells carried by the pcDNA3 vector. The enzymes were purified from cell extracts by using antibodies immobilized to agarose beads. For the substrate, we used a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal region of JAK2 where the autophosphorylation sites reside. The data shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the GST fusion protein was phosphorylated by JAK2. More importantly, JAK2V617F produced a much stronger phosphorylation than wild type JAK2. Furthermore, JAK2 itself was autophosphorylated, and JAK2V617F showed a higher level of autophosphorylation. Together, these data indicate that the V617F mutation increases the kinase activity of JAK2.Fig. 3JAK2V617F has enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. JAK2 and JAK2V617F were immunopurified from HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3-JAK2 or JAK2V617F. Kinase activity assays were performed with GST-JAK2CT as a substrate in the presence of ATP-Mg2+. Tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY) and the protein levels of JAK2/JAK2V617F and GST-JAK2CT, by anti-JAK and anti-GST, respectively. IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To analyze whether JAK2V617F produces a gain-of-function phenotype in cells, we co-expressed EPOR with JAK2 or JAK2V617F in HeLa cells. The cells were treated or left untreated with erythropoietin, and activation of various signaling components was accessed by using phosphospecific antibodies. As expected, expression of JAK2V617F resulted in a much high activation of STAT5, ERK1/2, and Akt than the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4). Significant activation of these signaling components was seen even in the absence of erythropoietin. These data demonstrate that JAK2V617F causes hyperactivation of signal transduction pathways induced by EPO, which presumably is responsible for the EPO-independent growth of PV erythroid progenitor cells and the hypersensitivity of these cells to growth factors and cytokines.Fig. 4JAK2V617F causes hyperactivation of EPO-induced cell signaling. HeLa cells were co-transfected with EPOR and JAK2 or JAK2V617F. Cells were treated with 40 units/ml EPO for 15 min and then extracted. Cell extracts were subjected to Western blotting analyses with the indicated antibodies. Additional data indicate that the protein levels of STAT5, Akt, and ERK1/2 were not altered by the cell transfection (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we identified an acquired mutation of JAK2 in 83% of PV samples that we analyzed. This mutation causes replacement of a key valine residue by phenylalanine in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 that has an inhibitory role. Structural analysis predicts gain-of-function phenotype. Our further study by overexpressing the mutant enzyme demonstrated that the mutant enzyme has enhanced kinase activity and causes hyperactivation of signal transduction pathways downstream of EPOR. We thus defined a molecular defect of the PV disease. This should have major implications in the diagnosis and treatment of PV disease. Increasing evidence has shown that tyrosine kinases are excellent targets for cancer drug therapies. JAK2 thus becomes a potential target for developing therapeutic drugs to treat PV.JAK2 is a PTK involved in signaling pathways by members of the single chain receptors (e.g. EPOR, TPOR, GHR, PRLR), the IL-3 receptor family (IL-3R, IL-5R, and GM-CSF-R), the gp130 receptor family, and the class II receptor cytokine family (19Kisseleva T. Bhattacharya S. Braunstein J. Schindler C.W. Gene. 2002; 285: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 20Verma A. Kambhampati S. Parmar S. Platanias L.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). JAK2 knock-out mice exhibited an embryonic lethal phenotype, dying on day 12.5 of gestation due to a failure in definitive erythropoiesis (21Neubauer H. Cumano A. Muller M. Wu H. Huffstadt U. Pfeffer K. Cell. 1998; 93: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 22Parganas E. Wang D. Stravopodis D. Topham D.J. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Vanin E.F. Bodner S. Colamonici O.R. van Deursen J.M. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). This is similar to what occurs in EPO–/– and EPOR–/– mice (23Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), indicating that JAK2 has pivotal functions for signal transduction initiated by growth factors and cytokines required in definitive erythropoiesis. A primary growth factor involved in erythropoiesis is EPO (24Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 77: 419-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its receptor, EPOR, does not possess kinase activity, but it is associated with the latent JAK2. Binding of EPO to EPOR activates JAK2 and results in activation of PI3K/Akt, STAT5, and ERKs (25Sui X. Krantz S.B. You M. Zhao Z. Blood. 1998; 92: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth and expansion of erythroid progenitor cells absolutely requires the presence of EPO. However, some PV erythroid progenitor cells possess the ability to grow autonomously, namely in the absence of EPO (1Green A.R. Lancet. 1996; 347: 844-845Abstract PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2Prchal J.F. Prchal J.T. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Spivak J.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4272-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have demonstrated no abnormality in EPOR in PV cells, suggesting hyperactivation in downstream signaling components. In this regard, it is not surprising that we found gain-of-function mutation of JAK2 in PV. In fact, earlier cytogenetic studies also support a possible involvement of JAK2 in PV. The JAK2 gene is localized to chromosome 9p24. Trisomies of chromosome 9 are common manifestations of PV and are found in 6.6% of PV cases (26Bench A.J. Nacheva E.P. Champion K.M. Green A.R. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1998; 11: 819-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this study, we detected mutation of JAK2 at Val617 in 20 of 24 samples analyzed. Those without such a JAK2 mutation might also involve activation of the enzyme through a different mechanism.The JAK family PTKs have a unique domain structure with a kinase domain (JH1) adjacent to a pseudokinase domain (JH2) (12Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar, 13Ihle J.N. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 6: 1-35Google Scholar). The JH2 domain lacks essential amino acid residues conserved in active protein kinases. The third Gly of the canonical GXGXXG motif in subdomain I is replaced by Thr; the conserved Asp in the DxxxxN motif in subdomain VIB is replaced by Ala; DFG in subdomain VII becomes DPG (see Fig. 2). The lack of these key residues would make the pseudokinase domain catalytically inactive, which has been confirmed. In fact, the pseudokinase domain plays a key regulatory role by inhibiting the kinase activity of JH1. The V617F mutation occurs on the C-terminal side of β-sheet 4 in subdomain III of the pseudokinase domain, which may cause major conformational changes and thereby disrupt the inhibitory effects. This appears to be the case based on our kinase activity analyses (Fig. 3).PV is a clonal disorder and the defect is intrinsic to the progenitor cells. The hypersensitivity of PV progenitor cells to growth factors/cytokines and the autonomous growth of some populations of erythroid progenitor cells in the absence of growth factors suggest hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways. Indeed, an earlier study demonstrated that peripheral granulocytes from some PV patients have constitutive STAT3 DNA binding activity (27Roder S. Steimle C. Meinhardt G. Pahl H.L. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 694-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and a recent study showed systematic increased phosphorylation of Akt/PKB in purified erythroid colony-forming cells from PV patients (28Dai C. Chung I.J. Krantz S.B. Exp. Hematol. 2005; 33: 152-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As a signal transducer immediately downstream of EPOR, enhanced JAK2 activity due to its mutation would cause hyperactivation of further downstream signaling components, thereby causing abnormal cell growth. By co-expressing JAK2 with EPOR in a model cell line, our study has demonstrated that the JAK2 mutant indeed causes hyperactivition of signal transduction pathways induced by EPO (Fig. 4). We also expressed the JAK2 mutant in primary CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from normal blood by using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer as described previously (11Xu M.J. Sui X. Zhao R. Dai C. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. Blood. 2003; 102: 4354-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, this failed to produce a significant effect on the growth and development of these cells in vitro (data not shown). One possible explanation is that gain-of-function mutation of JAK2 was not sufficient to transform primary cells. This implies that other abnormalities such as loss of tumor suppressors may be associated with PV. 2Four articles reporting similar findings have recently been published or are currently in press (29Baxter E.J.

This paper studies two of the four GM varieties that are now in farm-level preproduction trials, the last step before commercialization. Farm surveys of randomly selected farm households that are cultivating the insect-resistant GM rice varieties, without the aid of experimental station technicians, demonstrate that when compared with households cultivating non-GM rice, small and poor farm households benefit from adopting GM rice by both higher crop yields and reduced use of pesticides, which also contribute to improved health."

We show that the classic latitudinal cline in the alcohol dehydrogenase polymorphism of Drosophila melanogaster has shifted over 20 years in eastern coastal Australia. Southern high-latitude populations now have the genetic constitution of more northerly populations, equivalent to a shift of 4° in latitude. A similar shift was detected for a genetically independent inversion polymorphism, whereas two other linked polymorphisms exhibiting weaker clinal patterns have remained relatively stable. These genetic changes are likely to reflect increasingly warmer and drier conditions and may serve as sensitive biomarkers for climate change."
https://openalex.org/W1998447705,"Modern yeast living in fleshy fruits rapidly convert sugars into bulk ethanol through pyruvate. Pyruvate loses carbon dioxide to produce acetaldehyde, which is reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (Adh1) to ethanol, which accumulates. Yeast later consumes the accumulated ethanol, exploiting Adh2, an Adh1 homolog differing by 24 (of 348) amino acids. As many microorganisms cannot grow in ethanol, accumulated ethanol may help yeast defend resources in the fruit. We report here the resurrection of the last common ancestor of Adh1 and Adh2, called Adh(A). The kinetic behavior of Adh(A) suggests that the ancestor was optimized to make (not consume) ethanol. This is consistent with the hypothesis that before the Adh1-Adh2 duplication, yeast did not accumulate ethanol for later consumption but rather used Adh(A) to recycle NADH generated in the glycolytic pathway. Silent nucleotide dating suggests that the Adh1-Adh2 duplication occurred near the time of duplication of several other proteins involved in the accumulation of ethanol, possibly in the Cretaceous age when fleshy fruits arose. These results help to connect the chemical behavior of these enzymes through systems analysis to a time of global ecosystem change, a small but useful step towards a planetary systems biology."

This new discrimination of changes in NADH concentration, conformation, and environment provides the foundation for quantitative functional imaging of neural energy metabolism. The role of the intrinsic fluorophore NADH as the principal electron donor in glycolytic and oxidative energy metabolism makes it a convenient non-invasive fluorescent probe of metabolic state (1Chance B. Jobsis F. Schoener B. Cohen P. Science. 1962; 137: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 2Chance B. Williams G.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Subj. Biochem. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar). Traditionally, fluorimetric studies of metabolic dynamics have characterized metabolic states by the total NADH concentration. However, Williams et al. (3Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) pointed out that the reaction velocity of a given intracellular NADH-linked dehydrogenase depends on the concentration of locally available NADH, i.e. the local concentration of free NADH. Given this thermodynamic importance of free NADH, considerable research has been done to discriminate the intracellular free fraction of NADH. Analytical chemistry techniques have provided the most accurate and detailed information about intracellular free and total NADH. Pyridine nucleotide extraction (4Klaidman L.K. Leung A.C. Adams J.D.

However, these techniques entail destroying the tissue, thereby restricting the study of metabolic dynamics to single shot measurements. Furthermore, these techniques are also intrinsically incapable of resolving spatial variations in the free/bound state ratios. In contrast, fluorescence spectroscopic techniques (9Chance B.

These techniques are limited, however, by the ambiguous distinction between free and bound NADH fluorescence. Binding-induced shifts of the emission spectrum (up to ∼20 nm) (9Chance B.

D., and Glass, B., eds) pp. 108-143, The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, MDGoogle Scholar) are small compared with the width of the NADH spectrum (∼150 nm). Fluorescence lifetime is a more sensitive probe of NADH binding because it is enhanced significantly (up to 10 times) (12Gafni A. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3165-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Paul R.J. Schneckenburger H. Naturwissenschaften. 1996; 83: 32-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Wakita M. Nishimura G. Tamura M. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the fluorescence decay of bound NADH is usually multi exponential with shorter components that can be comparable with the decay time of free NADH (12Gafni A. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3165-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This makes it difficult to attribute a fast fluorescence decay component in tissue to free or bound NADH. Since intracellular NADH exists in dynamic pools of both the free form and bound to many different dehydrogenases, the integrated cellular spectra are an uncertain combination of many different spectral influences. What is required is a fluorescence signature that can unambiguously discriminate between free and bound intracellular NADH. Here we show that global analysis of time resolved fluorescence and anisotropy decays (16Knutson J.R. Beechem J.M. Brand L. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1983; 102: 501-507Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 17Lakowicz J.R. Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 357-364Google Scholar) provides simultaneous information on the excited state dynamics and rotational mobility of intracellular NADH. Binding of NADH leads to an exceedingly large (>10 times) increase in the anisotropy decay time (15Hones G. Hones J. Hauser M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), reflecting the large difference in the size of the free NADH molecule and the binding enzyme. An anisotropy-based approach therefore offers the most sensitive discrimination of free and enzyme bound NADH. Furthermore, the enhancement in the lifetime of NADH in the intracellular environment provides a measure of the enhancement of its fluorescence quantum yield. By correcting for changes in the fluorescence quantum yield, we can infer fractional changes in the true NADH concentration as a function of metabolic state. We thus present a means of directly monitoring metabolic state dependent changes in the total concentration of NADH and its partition into free and bound pools, thereby bridging the gap between spectroscopy and analytical chemistry. The protocol for preparing and maintaining transverse hippocampal slices from Sprague-Dawley rats (day 14-20) has been described previously (18Kasischke K.A. Vishwasrao H.D. Fisher P.J. Zipfel W.R. Webb W.W. Science. 2004; 305: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 19Kasischke K. Buchner M. Ludolph A.C. Riepe M.W. Acta Neuropathol. 2001; 101: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, imaging data revealed that the fluorescence response of slices to hypoxia reached a steady state in ∼5 min (18Kasischke K.A. Vishwasrao H.D. Fisher P.J. Zipfel W.R. Webb W.W. Science. 2004; 305: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) 1The abbreviations used are: ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; mMDH, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase. equilibrated with a mixture of 95% O2/5% CO2 was perfused over the hippocampal slice at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min to maintain the slice in the normoxic state for 10 min prior to acquiring spectra in the normoxic state. The perfusate was then switched to hypoxic ACSF (95% N2/5% CO2) for 10 min prior to acquiring spectra in the hypoxic state. To ensure reversibility of the metabolic response, spectra were once more acquired after reperfusion with normoxic ACSF for 15 min. The spectra acquired after reperfusion with normoxic ACSF were similar to the spectra acquired before hypoxia, indicating a fully reversible metabolic transition and no significant photodamage during the acquisition of spectra. Our two-photon time resolved fluorescence setup has been described previously (18Kasischke K.A. Vishwasrao H.D. Fisher P.J. Zipfel W.R. Webb W.W. Science. 2004; 305: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 20Heikal A.A. Hess S.T. Webb W.W. Chem. Phys. 2001; 274: 37-55Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (3Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). A 670 DCLP dichroic and BGG22 emission filter (350-550 nm) (Chroma) were used to separate the NADH fluorescence from the 740 nm two-photon excitation beam. While the intracellular fluorescence consists of both a blue NADH peak and a weak yellow flavin peak (Fig. 1), our choice of emission filter attenuated the contribution of the flavin fluorescence to less than 5%. The blue emission peak also receives a contribution from intracellular NADPH that is spectrally identical to NADH. However the low concentration of NADPH in the hippocampus and its minimal involvement in energy metabolism makes this fluorescence a minor and roughly constant background signal (see “Discussion”). The acquisition of both time resolved fluorescence spectra and anisotropy decays using time correlated single photon counting on our apparatus have been described in detail elsewhere (20Heikal A.A. Hess S.T. Webb W.W. Chem. Phys. 2001; 274: 37-55Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar), so we shall be brief here. To maximize fluorescence collection efficiency during tissue measurements, the excitation beam was maintained stationary with respect to the optical axis of the microscope, and the sample was scanned using a computer controlled x-y stage (SCAN IM, Merzhäuser) so as to effectively raster scan the excitation beam in a 100 × 100 μm square in the stratum radiatum. This scanning stage technique reduces photodamage by distributing the exposure over an area ∼104 times the area of the focused excitation beam. Taking advantage of the optical sectioning ability of two-photon excitation, fluorescence was excited at 70-100 μm within the slice. This depth was chosen to avoid tissue near the surface of the brain slice that might be damaged during preparation. The polarization of the fluorescence emitted by a sample consists of parallel (I∥(t)) and perpendicular components (I⊥(t)). These orthogonal directions are defined with respect to the polarization of the excitation light. In the experiments described throughout this work, these two fluorescence components are typically measured sequentially, rotating an analyzer before the photodetector and integrating the fluorescence signal for equal times. Having measured these two fluorescence decay curves, we can calculate the total fluorescence decay curve (Itot(t), also known as the magic angle fluorescence decay) and the rotational anisotropy decay curve (r(t)), defined by Equations 1 and 2, respectively. Itot(t)=I||(t)+2GI⊥(t)(Eq. 1) r(t)=I||(t)−GI⊥(t)I||(t)+2GI⊥(t)(Eq. 2) Here, the G-factor is the degree to which the optical detection path preferentially transmits one polarization over the other. The total fluorescence decay is a measure of the population of the excited state. The anisotropy of the fluorescence is the degree to which molecular orientation polarizes the emitted fluorescence. The anisotropy is initially non-zero because the excitation beam polarization selectively excites a particular orientation of molecules. The decay of the anisotropy therefore measures the decay of net molecular orientation due to diffusive motion. The characteristic decay time, known as the rotational diffusion time, characterizes the timescale of this diffusive motion. The total fluorescence decay was calculated from the recorded parallel and perpendicular fluorescence decays according to Equation 1. The total fluorescence decay (Itot(t)) was then fit using either the commercial Becker & Hickl SPCImage 2.4 fitting program or custom-written fitting routines in Matlab. These programs utilize non-linear least squares fitting algorithms to fit the fluorescence decay with the following functional form. I(t)=(Ibaseline+I0(α0δ(t−t0)+∑i=1nai⋅exp(−(t−t0)/τi)))×R(t)(Eq. 3) Decay Kinetics—The sum of exponential terms in this expression represents the excited state fluorescence dynamics of the molecule. Each individual exponential term (ai exp(-t/τi) represents the decay of the excited state via a particular pathway. These different pathways can be associated with different fluorophores, different conformations of a fluorophore, or simply different excited state to ground state transitions in a fluorophore. For the purpose of general discussion, we will simply refer to the physical sources of these exponential decay components as species, since a more precise physical identification is case-specific. The amplitude (ai) of an individual decay component is equal to the fractional population of the species associated with it. Hence it follows that the sum of the fractional populations must be unity (see Equation 4). (∑i=1nai=1)(Eq. 4) The lifetime of a decay component is equal to the inverse of the total transition rate from the excited state to the ground state, i.e. Equation 5, τ=1kf=1kr+knr(Eq. 5) where kr is the radiative rate (the rate of relaxation from the excited to the ground state involving the emission of a fluorescence photon) and knr is the total non-radiative rate (the net rate of transition to the ground state not involving the emission of a fluorescence photon). The fluorescence quantum yield is by definition the fraction of those transitions back to the ground state which involve emitting a fluorescence photon. ϕf=krkr+knr=krτ(Eq. 6) Scattered Excitation Light—The δ function term (a0δ(t - t0) in Equation 3 represents any minor backscattered excitation light that bleeds through the emission filter. Since the excitation pulse is ∼100 fs in duration, the backscattered light will also be comparable in duration, with some temporal stretching due to the variability in pathlength of backscattered photons reaching the detector. The duration of this backscattered pulse is far below the temporal resolution of our detector (∼10 ps), and hence we can approximate it with a δ function. While this term can be excluded for measurements in solution, it is necessary in highly scattering tissue such as brain slices. Amplitudes and Offsets—Ibase line in Equation 3 is the baseline or background fluorescence, approximated as constant for all times. I0 is the peak fluorescence at time t0, where t0 is the temporal offset of the fluorescence decay from the start of the acquisition window. Response Function—R(t) is the measured response function of the system, recorded using second harmonic generation from powdered crystals of KDP* or rat tail collagen. This response function is convolved, f(t)⊗R(t)=∫−∞∞R(t')f(t−t')dt'(Eq. 7) with the guess fit function and then compared with the observed decay. Once the total intensity decay fit parameters have been obtained by the fitting program, we can calculate a number of useful derived quantities: 1)the average lifetime 〈τ〉 of the fluorescence; 〈τ〉=∑i=1naiτi/∑i=1nai(Eq. 8) 2)the fraction of the total fluorescence generated by each species i is fi; fi=aiτi∑j=1najτj(Eq. 9) the change in the concentration of species i upon hypoxia. Ci,hypoxiaCi,normoxia=ai,hypoxiaI0,hypoxiaai,normoxiaI0,normoxiaΔCi=Ci,hypoxia−Ci,normoxiaCi,normoxia=Ci,hypoxiaCi,normoxia−1(Eq. 10) The fluorescence anisotropy decay of a freely rotating molecule in an isotropic environment is usually described adequately by a single exponential, r(t)=r0exp(−t/θ)(Eq. 11) where θ is the rotational diffusion time of the molecule and r0 is the initial anisotropy. The anisotropy decays of many conventional fluorophores, e.g. fluorescein, coumarin, as well as NADH in solution or NADH fully bound to malate dehydrogenase in solution, were found to follow this functional form. The initial anisotropy (r0) is solely a property of the fluorophore itself and is related to the angle between the absorption and emission dipoles (δ) by Equation 12. r0=2α2α+3(3cos2δ−12)(Eq. 12) Based on the number of photons absorbed (α), the maximum theoretical r0 values are 0.4 and 0.57 for one-photon and two-photon events, respectively (corresponding to collinear dipoles, without depolarizing processes, i.e. δ = 0. The higher theoretical maximum of two-photon fluorescence anisotropy (compared with one-photon) offers a greater dynamic range, and therefore sensitivity, for the measurement of rotational anisotropy. The rotational diffusion time, on the other hand, depends not only upon the fluorophore molecule itself but also upon the environmental conditions. This dependence may be summarized by the Stokes-Einstein equation (Equation 13). θ=16Drot=ηVkT(Eq. 13) where Drot is the rotational diffusion coefficient, V is the hydrodynamic volume of the molecule, η is the local viscosity of the environment, T is the absolute temperature, and k is the Boltzmann constant. This relation approximates the hydrodynamic volume (molecule + hydrodynamic shell) of the molecule to be spherical, which is a reasonable approximation for NADH (21Couprie M.E. Merola F. Tauc P. Garzella D. Delboulbe A. Hara T. Billardon M. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1994; 65: 1485-1495Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We use this relation later to differentiate between free and bound NADH as well as to estimate the viscosity of the intracellular environment. While a single exponential anisotropy decay approximates the decay of a free fluorophore, more complicated decays are also possible under certain circumstances. Of particular relevance here, associated anisotropy is the form of fluorescence anisotropy arising from a mixture of fluorophore species, each fluorophore species having its own distinct fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy decays. The fluorescence anisotropy decay from the mixture is the average of the fluorescence anisotropy decays of the individual species, weighted by their respective fluorescence decays. Fitting the anisotropy decay with the associated anisotropy model associates a distinct rotational diffusion time with each lifetime decay component as described by Equation 14 (22Bialik C.N. Wolf B. Rachofsky E.L. Ross J.B.A. Laws W.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2564-2573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Fisz J.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1996; 259: 579-587Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). r(t)=∑i=1naiexp(−t/τi)r0iexp(−t/θi)∑i=1naiexp(−t/τi)(Eq. 14) where each species i has its own set of total intensity decay parameters (ai, τi) and set of anisotropy decay parameters (r0i, θi). The analysis of anisotropy decay curves is somewhat more difficult than a simple non-linear least squares fit provided by most commercial data analysis software. Hence, it was necessary to write custom programs to perform these fits. The fitting protocol employed during this analysis is a form of global analysis specifically modified for analyzing associated anisotropy decays. Recall that the actual measured fluorescence decays are the parallel (I∥(t)) and perpendicular (I⊥(t)) polarization components of the fluorescence decay. From these, one can calculate the anisotropy decay curve using Equation 15. r(t)=I||(t)−GI⊥(t)I||(t)+2GI⊥(t)=∑i=1naiexp(−t/τi)r0iexp(−t/θi)∑i=1naiexp(−t/τi)(Eq. 15) In practice, however, we do not actually calculate r(t), but rather we calculate the numerator and denominator separately. By convention, the numerator is called the difference curve (D(t)) and the denominator is called the sum curve (S(t)), simply reflecting the operation between the parallel and perpendicular fluorescence components. Both the sum and difference curves are sums of exponentials. Furthermore, in practice, the functional form of each is more complicated than a simple sum of exponential terms. The most general form of both the sum and difference curves is analogous to Equation 3; that is, there are terms to account for baseline, scattered light, temporal offset, and detector response. S(t)=I||(t)+2GI⊥(t)=(Ibaseline,S+I0,S(a0,Sδ(t−t0)+∑i=1naiexp(−(t−t0)/τi)))⊗R(t)(Eq. 16) D(t)=I||(t)−GI⊥(t)=(Ibaseline,D+I0,D(a0,Dδ(t−t0)+∑i=1nr0iexp(−(t−t0)/θi)⋅aiexp(−(t−t0)/τi)))⊗R(t)(Eq. 17) To fit these individually with a minimization algorithm, we must define a reduced χ2 for both these curves, S(t)=I||(t)+2GI⊥(t)σS2(t)=I||(t)+4G2I⊥(t)χS2=1n−pS∑i=1n1σS2(ti)(S(ti)−Sfit(ti))2(Eq. 18) where n is the number of data points in the curve, pS is the number of fitting parameters, and Sfit is the trial fitting function. An analogous definition can be made for the difference curve D(t) but with a slightly different weighting factor. D(t)=I||(t)−GI⊥(t)σD2(t)=I||(t)+G2I⊥(t)χD2=1n−pD∑i=1n1σD2(ti)(D(ti)−Dfit(ti))2(Eq. 19) To facilitate the fit, we reduce the number of floating parameters in the functional form of the fitting function. Specifically, in Equations 16 and 17, the baseline intensities (Ibase line,S, Ibase line,D), the peak intensities (I0,S, I0,D), and the temporal offset (t0) can be calculated trivially from the curves themselves and set as constants while executing the fitting routine. Furthermore, by examining the functional form of the sum and difference decays (Equations 16 and 17) we see that there is a shared set of parameters between the sum and difference curves, namely the amplitudes and time constants of the total fluorescence decay, i.e. the ai, τi. Only the parameters characterizing the anisotropy decay (r0i) are specific to the difference decay. The parameters that are shared between the sum and difference decays are known as global parameters. The existence of global parameters enables us to employ a fitting protocol known as global analysis (16Knutson J.R. Beechem J.M. Brand L. Chem. Phys.

This technique fits two or more curves simultaneously that have a set of shared parameters and sets of parameters identified with individual curves. A measure of global goodness of fit must then be defined, known as the global χ2 (Equation 20), χglobal2=12n−(pS+pD−pgloble)⋅(∑i=1n1σS2(ti)(S(ti)−Sfit(ti))2+∑i=1n1σD2(ti)(D(ti)−Dfit(ti))2)(Eq. 20) where pglobal is the number of global parameters. The fitting protocol is schematically represented in Fig. 2. Thus, by performing a global fit, we can simultaneously fit S(t) and D(t) and automatically satisfy the constraint that certain shared parameters must have the same values in both fits. The global fit then provides us with both the total intensity decay parameters (ai, τi) and the anisotropy decay parameters (r0i, θi)in a single minimization operation with an improved resolution on the shared parameters. This global fitting protocol was tested by using a standard sample of fluorescein. Fluorescein was found to have mono-exponential fluorescence and anisotropy decays with a lifetime of 3.9 ns, a rotational diffusion time of 136 ps and a two-photon initial anisotropy of 0.39. These values are in good agreement with values previously reported in literature (24Bacskai B.J. Skoch J. Hickey G.A. Allen R. Hyman B.T. J. Biomed. Opt. 2003; 8: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 25Verkman A.S. Armijo M. Fushimi K. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 40: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tissue Fluorescence Measurement—Time resolved fluorescence decays were recorded from the stratum radiatum of the CA1 layer of rat hippocampal slices. This layer consists largely of axo-dendritic network with scattered astrocytes (Fig. 3A). Each slice was subjected to a 10-min hypoxic episode during which the intrinsic fluorescence increased in intensity (Fig. 3B) by an average of 48 ± 26%. Reperfusion with oxygenated solution returned the integrated fluorescence to approximately baseline levels (Fig. 3C), with a slight hyperoxidation due to post-hypoxic elevated mitochondrial metabolism (26Perez-Pinzon M.A. Mumford P.L. Sick T.J. Brain Res. 1998; 786: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Perez-Pinzon M.A. Mumford P.L. Carranza V. Sick T.J. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1998; 18: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This reversible response indicates negligible photodamage. The intrinsic fluorescence from the hippocampal slice consists of both a blue NADH peak and a yellow flavin peak (Fig. 1) that respond differently to hypoxia. However, our choice of emission filter ensured that the contribution from the NADH peak to the detected fluorescence was greater than 95%. Fluorescence decays at parallel and perpendicular polarizations were measured sequentially and used to calculate the total (magic angle) fluorescence decay and the anisotropy decay. Each total fluorescence and anisotropy decay pair was fit simultaneously using a global analysis to obtain the parameters characterizing both the excited state lifetime and the rotational mobility. The average of the total fluorescence decays (n = 6) under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions are shown in Fig. 4A. The tissue fluorescence is found to have four exponential decay components (we will call these species 1 through 4) whose lifetimes (ti) and amplitudes, or relative concentrations (ai), are summarized in Table I. The lifetimes (ti) are characteristic decay times of the excited state of each species. The amplitudes (ai) of the species are the relative concentrations of the species. In response to hypoxia, there is a modest decrease in all but the longest time constant. The amplitudes, however, are heterogeneous in their response. There are decreases in the amplitudes of the two longer lifetime species in favor of the two shorter lifetime species. The net effect of these changes is a decrease in the average lifetime from 948 ± 46 ps (normoxia) to 780 ± 17 ps (hypoxia). From the total fluorescence decay parameters, we can calculate a number of physically important quantities. First, the changes in the absolute concentrations of the individual species (ΔCi) are calculated to be: 86 ± 45% (species 1), 104 ± 43% (species 2), 39 ± 25% (species 3), and 58 ± 35% (species 4). The increase in the total concentration of NADH upon hypoxia was calculated to be 81 ± 39%, which is substantially greater than the change in the total fluorescence (48 ± 26%) due to the decrease in the fluorescence average lifetime. The large errors are due to significant variation in the integrated fluorescence response to hypoxia and not to large errors in the fitting parameters. Second, the fractional contributions to the fluorescence (fi) from each species during normoxia can be calculated to be: 7% (species 1), 20% (species 2), 46% (species 3), and 27% (species 4). Note that while species 1 has the largest concentration (44%), it contributes the least to the total fluorescence due to its short lifetime.Table ISummary of the fluorescence lifetime parametersSpecies 1Species 2Species 3Species 4<τ>a1τ1 (ps)a2τ2 (ps)a3τ3 (ps)a4τ4 (ps)Normoxia0.44 (0.02)155 (25)0.32 (0.01)599 (49)0.20 (0.01)2154 (79)0.042 (0.003)6040 (13)948 (46)Hypoxia0.45 (0.02)129 (7)0.36 (0.01)530 (17)0.16 (0.01)1975 (72)0.0037 (0.001)6054 (22)779 (17)% change upon hypoxia+2 (6)−15 (15)+13 (6)−11 (9)−22 (7)−8 (6)−12 (5)+0.2 (0.5)−18 (4) Open table in a"

The reduction of NONO expression by RNA interference (RNAi) attenuated circadian rhythms in mammalian cells, and fruit flies carrying a hypomorphic allele were nearly arrhythmic. WDR5, a subunit of histone methyltransferase complexes, augmented PER-mediated transcriptional repression, and its reduction by RNAi diminished circadian histone methylations at the promoter of a clock gene."

In view of thesefindings, the existence of a potential “CO sensor” that regulatesASMC proliferation cannot be excluded a priori and represents achallenging hypothesis to explore further.

Gp91phox, the catalytic moiety of the oxidase,is a plasma membrane-associated flavohemoprotein containing one flavin-adeninedinucleotide and two hemes that catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction ofoxygen to form superoxide(17Babior B.

The mitochondrial respiratory chain is composed of different cytochromesaccounting for 85–90% of the O2 consumed in the cell.Approximately 1–3% of this O2 is incompletely metabolized anddiverted into superoxide anion(18Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem.J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). Inhibition of electrontransfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain is associated with asignificant increase in the production of superoxide anion and hydrogenperoxide and a decreased cell proliferation(14Carriere A. Fernandez Y. Rigoulet M. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,16Horimoto M. Fulop P. Derdak Z. Wands J.R. Baffy G. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It must be noted thatthis is in contrast with the mitogenic effect of NAD(P)H oxidase-derivedsuperoxide anion. Although there is no clear explanation for the discrepancybetween the effects of mitochondria- and NAD(P)H oxidase-derived ROS on cellproliferation, most evidence suggests that the intensity and subcellularorigins of ROS may be crucial in their effects on cell fate. Because CO has a high affinity for heme groups (for a review, see Ref.19Piantadosi C.A. Antioxid. RedoxSignal. 2002; 4: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that COcould behave as a modulator of redox signals by interacting with heme andinhibiting cytochrome b558 of the NAD(P)H oxidase and/orcytochromes of the respiratory chain, consequently affecting redox-mediatedcell proliferation. Recently a group of transition metal carbonyls have been characterized ascarbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CORMs) to liberate CO in biologicalsystems providing a useful tool in research to examine the mechanism by whichCO exerts its pharmacological activities(20Motterlini R.

Dewas C. Gaudry M. Fay M. Pedruzzi E. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. El Benna J. J.Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20704-20708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes wereremoved by lysis with hypotonic solutions. Following isolation, cells wereresuspended in the appropriate medium such as Hank's balanced salt solution. Acell count was performed, and cell viability was determined using the trypanblue exclusion method. Following isolation, cells were resuspended in Hank's balanced saltsolution at a concentration of 2 million/ml. Superoxide production wasdetermined by measuring superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome creduction (26Dang P.M. Dewas C. Gaudry M. Fay M. Pedruzzi E. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. El Benna J. J.Biol.

The cellsuspension (1 ml) was placed in a cuvette with 1 ml of Hank's balanced saltsolution containing 160 μm cytochrome c. The cuvettewas placed in the thermostated chamber of the spectrophotometer (BeckmanDU640) and allowed to stabilize at 37 °C. After a base line was recorded,cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate. The referencecuvette contained 5 units of superoxide dismutase in addition to the mixture.Changes in absorbance at 550 nm were measured over a 10-min period. Resultswere calculated as nanomoles of superoxide produced/2 million cells/10 min fortotal superoxide production using a molar extinction coefficient of 21.1mm–1 cm–1. Intracellular ROS Production: DCFH-DA Oxidation—Cells werecultured in 96-well plates as described previously(2Taille C. Almolki A. Benhamed M. Zedda C. Megret J. Berger P. Leseche G. Fadel E.

DCFH-DA (10μm final concentration in Me2SO) was added 1 h beforestimulation; then the medium was removed, cells were washed twice withphosphate-buffered saline, fresh medium was added, and cells were stimulatedwith 50 ng/ml PDGF. Fluorescence was measured immediately after PDGF additionat 480–555 nm every 7 min during a 45-min period using a multiwellfluorescence plate reader. Intracellular ROS (especially hydroxyl radical) orhydrogen peroxide oxidize dichlorodihydrofluorescein, yielding the fluorescentproduct dichlorodifluorescein(25Thabut G. El-Benna J. Samb A. Corda S.

Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ROS Production—To assess whether the increasein intracellular ROS production would originate from mitochondria, we used thespecific fluorescent probe MitoTracker CM-H2XRos (500 nmfinal concentration in Me2SO, 30 min before PDGF), which becomesfluorescent upon oxidation(28Young T.A. Cunningham C.C. Bailey S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The protocol was similarto that used for DCFH-DA except that only one measurement was takenimmediately after addition of PDGF. The fluorescence was measured at578–599 nm. Immunoblotting for HO-1, NOS1, Phosphorylated ERK1/2, andCyclin D1—Western blot analysis for HO-1, NOS1, phosphorylatedERK1/2, and cyclin D1 was performed as described previously(2Taille C. Almolki A. Benhamed M. Zedda C. Megret J. Berger P. Leseche G. Fadel E. Yamaguchi T. Marthan R. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. J. Biol.

For HO-1 and NOS1expression, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of CORM-2 orRu(Me2SO)4Cl2 for 24 h and then scraped inlysis buffer. Fifty micrograms of proteins were loaded in each well. Anti-HO-1and -NOS1 monoclonal primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) was applied for 1 h,whereas anti-cyclin D1 antibody (1:200 dilution) was incubated overnight. Formeasurements of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cells were treated with differentconcentrations of CORM-2 for different times, then stimulated with 50 ng/mlPDGF for 10 min, and finally scraped in lysis buffer containing phosphataseinhibitors (2Taille C. Almolki A. Benhamed M. Zedda C. Megret J. Berger P. Leseche G. Fadel E. Yamaguchi T. Marthan R. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. J. Biol.

Using the same blots, theexpression of the housekeeping protein β-actin or total ERK1/2 wasevaluated using monoclonal antibodies. Optical densities were measured with aPerfect Image 2.01 image analysis system (Iconix, Courtaboeuf, France). Theresults were expressed as the ratio of the expression of HO-1, NOS1,phospho-ERK, or cyclin D1 over that of β-actin or total ERK1/2. Statistical Analysis—Values are given as the means ±S.E. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or non-parametrictests when appropriate. The significance for all statistics was accepted atp < 0.05. CORM-2 Inhibits PDGF-induced ASMC Proliferation—Toinvestigate how CO influences cell proliferation, we analyzed the effect ofCORM-2 on PDGF-induced ASMC proliferation(2Taille C. Almolki A. Benhamed M. Zedda C. Megret J. Berger P. Leseche G. Fadel E. Yamaguchi T. Marthan R. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27160-27168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We found that PDGF induceda 4-fold increase in ASMC proliferation. Treatment of cells with CORM-2 (10μm) 30 min before stimulation with PDGF reduced cellproliferation by about 50%. In contrast, the negative control(Ru(Me2SO)4Cl2, 10 μm), whichdoes not contain CO groups, did not modify the proliferative response(Fig. 1), confirming that COliberated from CORM-2 is directly involved in the observed effect. Thisconfirms that CORM-2 has effects similar to CO administrated as a gas in ASMCs(6Song R. Mahidhara R.S. Liu F. Ning W. Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.Biol. 2002; 27: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and is a useful tool forstudying the mechanisms of action of CO. It must be noted that no celltoxicity, as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase measurement in the medium andtrypan blue exclusion test, was evident at the concentrations of CORM-2 used.Cell toxicity of the compound was only observed at 100 μm (datanot shown). To further confirm that the effect of CORM-2 was mediated by CO releasedfrom the compound, we performed additional experiments in the presence ofmyoglobin, a CO scavenger. Indeed we observed that myoglobin (10μm) effectively reversed the antiproliferative effect of CORM-2(Fig. 1). Because HO-1 is known to inhibit smooth cell proliferation by itself(2Taille C. Almolki A. Benhamed M. Zedda C. Megret J. Berger P. Leseche G. Fadel E. Yamaguchi T. Marthan R. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol.Toxicol. 1997; 17: 517-554Crossref Scopus (2218) Google Scholar), we assessed whether theruthenium-containing CORM-2 or its negative control could induce HO-1expression per se at the time when proliferation was measured.However, we found no change in HO-1 protein expression after 24-h incubationof cells in the presence of 1 and 10 μm CORM-2(Fig. 2). We also investigatedwhether CORM-2 influenced the expression of NOS1 because this enzyme has beenshown to modulate ASMC proliferation(31Patel H.J. Belvisi M.G. Donnelly L.E. Yacoub M.H. Chung K.F. Mitchell J.A. FASEBJ. 1999; 13: 1810-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found no change inNOSI protein expression after 24-h incubation of cells in the presence ofCORM-2 (data not shown). Inhibition of NAD(P)H Oxidase by CORM-2 Contributes to the Attenuationof Cell Proliferation—As stated in the Introduction, NAD(P)Hoxidase-derived superoxide anions are involved in ASMC proliferation(11Brar S.S. Kennedy T.P. Sturrock A.B. Huecksteadt T.P. Quinn M.T. Murphy T.M. Chitano P. Hoidal J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L782-L795Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,32Page K. Li J. Corbit K.C.

We first confirmed thesefindings by using DPI (10 μm), an inhibitor of flavin-containingenzymes such as NAD(P)H oxidase(33Hancock J.T. White J.I. Jones O.T. Silver I.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As expected, DPIsignificantly reduced PDGF-induced cell proliferation(Fig. 1). It must be noted,however, that DPI could inhibit all flavo-containing enzymes such as NOS andrespiratory chain complex I and could also increase ROS production(34Riganti C. Gazzano E. Polimeni M. Costamagna C. Bosia A. Ghigo D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47726-47731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We think that theseeffects of DPI are unlikely under our experimental conditions because we havepreviously shown that the same concentration of DPI (10 μm) usedin the present study decreased intracellular ROS production in ASMCs(25Thabut G.

In the present study, we examined the possible functional relationship between α-synuclein and several forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma (SK-N-BE) cell line. When SK-N-BE cells were transiently transfected with α-synuclein, it was secreted into the extracellular culture media, concomitantly with a significant decrease in cell viability. Also the addition of nitric oxide-generating compounds to the cells caused the secreted α-synuclein to be digested, producing a small fragment whose size was similar to that of the fragment generated during the incubation of α-synuclein with various MMPs in vitro. Among several forms of MMPs, α-synuclein was cleaved most efficiently by MMP-3, and MALDI-TOF mass spectra analysis showed that α-synuclein is cleaved from its C-terminal end with at least four cleavage sites within the non-Aβ component of AD amyloid sequence. Compared with the intact form, the protein aggregation of α-synuclein was remarkably facilitated in the presence of the proteolytic fragments, and the fragment-induced aggregates showed more toxic effect on cell viability. Moreover, the levels of MMP-3 were also found to be increased significantly in the rat PD brain model produced by the cerebral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the substantia nigra.

There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that the abnormal accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein play a primary role in PD pathogenesis (1Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 2Lucking C.B. Brice A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). LBs are composed of polymers made up of full-length α-synuclein proteins (3Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar), and the formation of α-synuclein-positive inclusions is also seen in other synucleinopathies, such as diffuse Lewy body disease or multiple system atrophy (4Dickson D.W. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2001; 14: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, point mutations of the α-synuclein gene are associated with early-onset familial PD (5Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di Iorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L.

Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3263) Google Scholar).Considerable changes in the organization of the extracellular matrix occur in neurodegeneration. Remodeling of the extracellular matrix and its degradation are controlled by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of extracellular soluble or membrane-bound and structurally related zinc-dependent endopeptidases (7Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1345-1350PubMed Google Scholar, 8Woessner J Jr F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that MMPs play a role in the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as stroke (9Clark A.W. Krekoski C.A. Bou S.S. Chapman K.R. Edwards D.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 238: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (10Backstorm J.R. Giselle P.L. Cullen M.J. Zoltan A.T. J.

Neurol. 1996; 55: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).There is increasing evidence to suggest that oxidative or nitrative injury is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including PD (15Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 16Albers D.S. Beal M.F. J. Neural. Transm. Suppl. 2000; 59: 133-154PubMed Google Scholar). For example, there is ample evidence that oxidative injury is significantly enhanced in PD (17Good P.F. Hsu A. Werner P. Perl D.P. Olanow C.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress is also known to be an early feature of PD, because the oxidation-dependent aggregation of proteins has been observed in the form of advanced glycation end products in Lewy bodies at a time when no phenotype of a neurodegenerative disorder was evident. In addition, experimental models of PD show higher levels of free radical generation and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (18Cassarino D.S. Fall C.P. Swerdlow R.H. Smith T.S. Halvorsen E.M. Miller S.W. Parks J.P. Parker W.D. Bennett J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).One consequence of increased oxidative stress may be the activation of MMPs, which are synthesized primarily by astrocytes, microglia, and neurons (19Gottschall P.E. Deb S. Neuroimmunomodulation. 1996; 3: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, the excessive expression of MMPs may result in neuronal damage. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that MMPs are involved in the pathogenesis of PD (20Lorenzl S. Albers D.S. Narr S. Chirichigno J. Beal M.F. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 178: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Inducers of MMP expression and activity, such as cytokines, nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and metabolites of the arachidonic pathway (21Murrell G.A. Jang D. Williams R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 22Ries C. Petrides P.E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1995; 376: 345-355PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tamura T. Nakanishi T. Kimura Y. Hattori T. Sasaki K. Norimatsu H. Takahashi K. Takigawa M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3729-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), are also implicated in the pathophysiology of PD. Based on the hypothesis that the generation of free radicals stimulates the expression/activity of MMPs, and that free radical-mediated damage is a key mediator of neuronal damage in PD, it is tempting to speculate that MMPs are involved in the pathophysiology of PD.The cellular and physiological function and processing of α-synuclein are still poorly known. This protein was originally found to be located in presynaptic terminals and was thought to play a role in neuronal plasticity (24Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. de Silva H.A. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). However, several pieces of evidences have subsequently emerged that indicate that intact α-synuclein plays a functional role in non-cytoplasmic locations, such as nucleus and extracellular space, and in its processing. In the present study, we examined whether α-synuclein proteins could be secreted extracellularly in the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell (SK-N-BE) line. Moreover, we attempted to identify the cleaved α-synuclein fragments present in extracellular space and the possible functional relationship between several forms of MMPs and the processing mechanism of α-synuclein. Herein we show for the first time that the extracellularly secreted α-synuclein is selectively processed via the activation of MMP-3 upon the stimulation of dopaminergic neuronal cells with nitric oxide.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen, and MMP inhibitor II was obtained from Calbiochem. The anti-MMP-3 and α-synuclein antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratory. The plasmid used to express wild type α-synuclein was provided by R. Jakes (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). To prepare bacterially recombinant α-synuclein, α-synuclein proteins were either purchased from ATGen (Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) or purified as described elsewhere in the literature (25Kim J. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 78-83PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum and maintained at 37 °C. The cells were transfected with various expression vectors using Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of DNA in each individual transfection experiment was adjusted by using parental empty vector DNA. The cells were cultured for at least 24 h after transfection, and used in the subsequent immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, and cell viability assay experiments.Assessment of Cell Viability—Quantitation of cell survival was performed using the tetrazolium salt extraction method (28Sung J.Y. Kim J. Paik S.R. Park J.H. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27441-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). 62.5 μl of the 5 mg/ml stock solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added to each well of a 24-well plate in which 250 μl of medium was previously placed. After 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 250 μl of extraction buffer containing 20% SDS and 50% N,N-dimethylformamide at pH 7.4 was added. After incubating the reagents overnight at 37 °C, the optical density was measured at 570 nm using a SpectraMAX340 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), using extraction buffer as a standard. Statistical analyses were completed with the aid of the StatView II program for Macintosh computers (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). All data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and preplanned comparisons with the control were performed by means of Dunnett's t statistic.Nitrite Content Measurement—Nitrite was quantified by means of Griess reaction (29Follett M.J. Ratcliff P.W. J. Chromatogr. 1963; 14: 138-144Google Scholar). HCl (4 m) was added to the supernatant and left to stand for 10 min, and then 2 mg/ml sulfanilic acid and 1 mg/ml N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine were added. After incubation for 30 min, the absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 550 nm. The absorbance of each sample was compared with that of standard sodium nitrite solutions.Analysis of Protein Aggregation—The protein aggregation of α-synuclein was monitored with both turbidity and thioflavin-T binding fluorescence. Following ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min to remove any protein clumps that could act as a nucleation centers during the aggregation process, α-synuclein (138 μm) was incubated at room temperature with continuous shaking. The turbidity caused by protein aggregation was examined with absorbance at 405 nm. The extent of amyloid formation, on the other hand, was evaluated with thioflavin-T binding fluorescence (30Monji A. Tashiro K. Yoshida I. Hayashi Y. Tashiro N. Brain Res. 1998; 796: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). During incubation, small aliquots (20 μl) were combined with 5 μm thioflavin-T in 50 mm glycine at pH 8.5 to produce a final volume of 100 μl and, in each case, the fluorescence was measured at 482 nm with an excitation at 446 nm (FL500 Microplate Fluorescence Reader, Bio-Tek Instruments). The morphological appearances of the protein aggregates were also examined with a transmission electron microscope (JEM1010, JEOL). Aliquots (5 μl) of the aggregates were adsorbed onto a carbon-coated copper grid (300 mesh) and air-dried for 1 min. After negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate for another 1 min, the aggregates were observed under the electron microscope.Preparation of Pro-MMPs and MMP Catalytic Domains—The recombinant human pro-MMP-2 was expressed in Sf9 cells by infection of the 72Gel baculovirus and purified by gelatin-agarose column chromatography as described previously (31Jo Y. Yoon D.W. Kim M.Y. Lee Y.J. Kim H.J. Lee S.T. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 32: 60-66Google Scholar). The human full-length MMP-9 cDNA (a generous gift from Dr. G. Goldberg) was cloned into pBlueBac4 (Invitrogen), and 92Gel baculovirus was produced using Bac-N-Blue™ Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). Expression and purification of pro-MMP-9 was performed by the same method as in pro-MMP-2. Pro-MMP-1 (Calbiochem) and pro-MMP-3 (Oncogene) were purchased. The catalytic and hinge domains of human MMP-14 (Tyr112-Ile318), containing an N-terminal methionine and C-terminal hexa-histidines, were expressed as an inclusion body in Escherichia coli. A functional catalytic domain of MMP-14 (cMMP-14) was obtained by refolding of the recombinant MMP-14 polypeptide (39Koo H.M. Kim J.H. Hwang I.K. Lee S.J. Kim T.H. Rhee K.H. Lee S.T. Mol. Cells. 2002; 13: 118-124PubMed Google Scholar). A functional catalytic domain of the human MMP-3 was prepared by refolding of the catalytic domains (cMMP-3; Phe100-Pro273) expressed as inclusion body in E. coli (40Ye Q.Z. Johnson L.L. Hupe D.J. Baragi V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11231-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).In Vitro Cleavage of the Purified α-Synuclein with MMPs—1 μg of purified α-synuclein (ATGen) was incubated with various concentrations of MMPs and for various time intervals in an MMP-reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm ZnCl2) at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer, and the reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE.Determination of Cleavage Sites of α-Synuclein—To sequence the N-terminal amino acids of the α-synuclein fragments, the cMMP-3-cleaved α-synuclein mixture was separated in 15% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, containing 10% methanol (41Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the bands of interest were cut out and sequenced by Edman degradation using the 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the Tufts Core Facility (Tufts University). To determine molecular mass of the α-synuclein fragments, the cMMP-3-cleaved α-synuclein mixture was passed through a self-packed POROS 20 R2 (Applied Biosystems) cartridge to capture the protein. A solution of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used to wash unbound components from the cartridge, and the proteins were eluted with 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 70% acetonitrile. The elutes were dispensed onto a MALDI-TOF sample plate. The sample was allowed to air-dry at room temperature and then subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis. Mass analysis of the fragments was performed on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in the linear mode using a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Mass spectra were collected in the positive ion mode using an acceleration voltage of 25 kV and a delay of 800 ns. The grid voltage, low mass gate, and laser intensity were set to 96%, 1000.0 m/z, and 2,500, respectively. Each mass spectrum collected represents the sum of the data from 500 laser shots. Cytochrome c and aprotinin were used as internal calibrants. For each proteolytic fragment, the mean and standard deviation of the experimental molecular mass (m/z) were determined from six independent experiments. The theoretical molecular mass (m/z) was determined using an ExPASy-computed pI/MW tool program (us.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool).RT-PCR and Western Blot Analysis—To detect the mRNA synthesis of MMP-3 by RT-PCR, the sense primer (5′-ATTATACACCAGATTTGCAAAAGA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-AAAAGAACCCAAATTCTTCAAAAAC-3′) were synthesized for MMP-3. For the Western blot analysis, cells were solubilized with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF. Then, the cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with a suitable antibody, incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the bands were visualized by Enhanced Luminol reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Electron Microscopic Observation—The samples were fixed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), including 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, and 0.5% CaCl2 for 6 h and washed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. The samples were post-fixed with 1.33% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer for 2 h. The fixed samples were washed with 0.1% cacodylate buffer for 10 min. After washing, the samples were dehydrated with ethanol and incubated with propylene oxide for 10 min. Embedding Epon mixture (Epon812, methylnalic anhydride, dodecenylsuccinic anhydride, and 2,4,6-tri(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol) was prepared, and the samples were sectioned using an ultramicrotome followed by double staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (Philips CM-10).Surgical Procedure for the Striatal 6-Hydroxydopamine Lesion in Rats—All animal experiments were approved by the Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at Yonsei University. All animals were cared for according to The Guide for Animal Experiments, 2000, edited by the Korean Academy of Medical Sciences, which was consistent with the NIH Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 1996 revised edition. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 290-330 g, were used. They were housed in cages containing two animals each, under a 12-h light-dark cycle with free access to food and water. The rats were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate (0.4 mg/g, intraperitoneal). For stereotaxic lesion surgery, 8 μm 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, Sigma) was dissolved in 0.9% saline containing 0.02% ascorbic acid and was kept on ice protected from light. 6-OHDA was injected stereotaxically at three different points in the right striatum: 1) anterior-posterior +1.0 mm, medial-lateral -3.0 mm, dorsal-ventral -5.0 mm; 2) anterior-posterior -0.1 mm, medial-lateral -3.7 mm, dorsal-ventral -5.0 mm; and 3) anterior-posterior -1.2 mm, medial-lateral -4.5 mm, dorsal-ventral -5.0 mm from the Bregma, according to the Atlas of Paxinos and Watson (32Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. 4th Ed. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Triple 6-OHDA injections were prepared, each containing 10 μg of 6-OHDA per 5 μl, and administered using a 26-gauge cannula fitted to a Hamilton microsyringe at a rate of 1 μl/min. At the completion of each injection, the needle was left in place for 5 min and then slowly withdrawn.Tissue Preparation for Histological Studies—At 3 weeks after lesioning, the animals were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate, which was perfused through the ascending aorta with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The brain then was removed carefully and post-fixed for 1 day in the same solution. Each brain was dehydrated in 30% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at 4 °C for at least 3 days before it was sectioned. Six series of 40 μm-thick coronal sections were cut on a freezing microtome (MICROM).RESULTSThe Overexpression of α-Synuclein Caused the Formation of Its Cytoplasmic Inclusion and Subsequent Neuronal Cell Death—At first we examined whether α-synuclein is expressed in the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-BE). After the cell lysates were prepared from the proliferating cells, the presence of the α-synuclein protein was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-α-synuclein antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, the endogenous protein level of α-synuclein in the SK-N-BE cells was too low to be detected. When the cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding α-synuclein, the protein was properly expressed inside the cells, as compared with the mock-transfected control cells (Fig. 1A). In addition to the α-synuclein monomer, the formation of its oligomers was also observed (Fig. 1A). Immunocytochemical visualization of the cells clearly showed that the distribution of the transiently transfected α-synuclein was uneven and took the form of granular aggregates in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Following the transient transfection of a plasmid encoding α-synuclein into the cells, the change in cell viability was measured after 24 h by means of the MTT extraction method. As shown in Fig. 1B, the overexpression of α-synuclein significantly decreased the cell viability in the SK-N-BE cells. We have previously shown that the addition of recombinant α-synuclein or the transient transfection of α-synuclein into hippocampal neuroprogenitor cells (H19-7) leads to neuronal cell death, and this result appears to be closely associated with the formation of intracytoplasmic α-synuclein-positive inclusions, having similar components to the LBs found in PD patients (28Sung J.Y.

As shown in Fig. 2A, as well as being found in the cytoplasm, α-synuclein was also detected in the extracellular culture media after 24 h of its transfection, suggesting that extracellular secretion did indeed occur. However, the generation of a proteolytic α-synuclein fragment, which is similar to the partial fragment of α-synuclein observed as the non-Aβ component of amyloid plaque in AD, was not observed in the proliferating SK-N-BE cells in the absence of any stimulation (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Extracellular secretion and the cleavage of α-synuclein via MMP in response to NO donors. A, after SK-N-BE cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of plasmid encoding α-synuclein for the indicated times, the culture medium was harvested and concentrated. The presence of α-synuclein and the formation of its aggregates in concentrated media were identified by Western blot analysis with the anti-α-synuclein IgG. B, where specified, SK-N-BE cells were mock-transfected or transiently transfected with 5 μg of plasmid encoding α-synuclein (pSyn) for 24 h. The cells were pretreated with 1 mm MMP inhibitor II (MMPi) for 6 h, and stimulated with 100 μm SIN-1 for another 24 h, as indicated. The cultured media were isolated and concentrated, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by the immunoblotting with anti-α-synuclein antibodies. C, after the SK-N-BE cells were either mock-transfected or transfected with 5 μg of α-synuclein plasmid for 24 h, the cells were then untreated or stimulated with NO donor, sodium nitroprusside at a concentration of 100 μm in the absence or presence of 1 mm MMPi, as indicated. After 24 h, the cultured media was concentrated, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence and processing of α-synuclein were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-α-synuclein IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Addition of NO Donor Resulted in the Fragmentation of Secreted α-Synuclein via MMPs in SK-N-BE Cells—There is increasing evidence to suggest that oxidative injury is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including PD, and the nitration of tyrosine residues in α-synuclein induced by oxidative injury is closely associated with the formation of the inclusions characteristic of these synucleinopathies (15Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Based on these previous findings, we next examined whether the intracellular generation of nitrating agents affects the secretion of α-synuclein in SK-N-BE cells and the mechanism by which the cleavage of α-synuclein takes place under these conditions, if indeed this was to occur. To assess the generation of reactive NO molecules, the formation of nitrite (NO-2), a stable breakdown product of NO, was assessed quantitatively (Table I). After transfection with a plasmid encoding α-synuclein in a transient manner, SK-N-BE cells grown in regular 10% fetal bovine serum generated very little nitrite, with the quantity measured being close to the background level. In contrast, further treatment of the cells with an NO donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), brought about a ∼5.5-fold increase of nitrite formation. When other NO donors, such as sodium nitroprusside and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, were added to the media and left for 24 h, the resulting nitrite formation was increased by ∼4.7- and ∼4.3-fold, respectively, as expected (Table I).Table IEffect of NO donor on nitrite formation in SK-N-BE cellsTreatmentNitrite formationnmol/∼7 × 104 cellsControl0.94 ± 0.16α-Synuclein1.39 ± 0.30SIN-1 (100 μm)5.24 ± 0.67SNP (100 μm)4.24 ± 0.34SNAP (100 μm)3.85 ± 0.64α-Syn plus SIN-15.94 ± 0.51α-Syn plus SNP4.78 ± 0.31α-Syn plus SNAP4.63 ± 0.70 Open table in a new tab Following the transient transfection of SK-N-BE cells with the plasmid encoding α-synuclein"

We combined triple-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (tpTMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS) to determine which distinct aspect of mental imagery is carried out by the left and right parietal lobe and to reveal interhemispheric compensatory interactions. The left parietal lobe was predominant in generating mental images, whereas the right parietal lobe was specialized in the spatial comparison of the imagined content. Furthermore, in case of an rTMS-induced left parietal lesion, the right parietal cortex could immediately compensate such a left parietal disruption by taking over the specific function of the left hemisphere."

We recently performed a tracer release experiment in the western tropical Atlantic staircase at approximately 400 m depth. The observed dispersion implies an effective diapycnal diffusivity for tracer and salt of 0.8 to 0.9 x 10(-4) m2/s. Temperature microstructure data interpreted in terms of a vertical production-dissipation balance yields a smaller effective diffusivity for heat of 0.45 (+/- 0.2) x 10(-4) m2/s, consistent with salt fingers and well above the mixing ascribable to mechanical turbulence."

Here we examined the effect of ascochlorin, a prenyl-phenol anti-tumor compound from the fungus Ascochyta viciae, on the regulation of signaling pathways that control MMP-9 expression in human renal carcinoma (Caki-1) cells. Ascochlorin reduced the invasive activity of Caki-1 cells and inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced increases in MMP-9 expression and activity in a dose-dependent manner. Reporter gene, electrophoretic mobility shift, kinase inhibitor assays, and in vitro kinase assay showed that ascochlorin inhibits MMP-9 gene expression by suppressing activation of the nuclear transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 pathway. The AP-1 family member most specifically affected by ascochlorin was Fra-1. Ascochlorin did not affect the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal or p38 kinase pathways. Moreover, transfection of Caki-1 cells with AP-1 decoy oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in the suppression of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion.

MMPs are a family of zinc-dependent endoproteinases that are capable of degrading all the components of the ECM. MMPs are structurally and functionally homologous proteins, with at least 20 known members. MMPs can be divided into four families based on structure and substrate specificity: collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and membrane-associated MMPs. Among the previously reported human MMPs, gelatinase-A (MMP-2) and gelatinase-B (MMP-9) are key enzymes that degrade type IV collagen (14Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 15Lelongt B. Trugnan G. Murphy G. Ronco P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These two gelatinases share structural and catalytic similarities, but transcription of the MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes is independently regulated due to distinct arrays of regulatory elements in the gene promoters. Regulated expression of MMP-9 has been implicated in renal development, macrophage differentiation, atherosclerosis, inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and tumor invasion (16Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Int. 2002; 52: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In contrast, MMP-2 is usually expressed constitutively.Recent studies have reported a positive correlation between the expression of MMP-9 and tumor metastasis in colorectal cancer and several other types of epithelial cancers (18Zucker S.

Metastasis of cancer cells requires several sequential steps, including changes in cell-ECM interactions, dissociation of intercellular adhesion complexes, separation of single cells from the solid tumor mass, degradation of the ECM, and locomotion of tumor cells into the ECM (20Bernhard E.J.

The production of MMP-9 can be induced by a number of factors, including the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α. Tumor necrosis factor-α also serves as an autocrine regulator of the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced expression of MMP-9. It is known that the human MMP-9 promoter contains several cis-acting regulatory elements that participate in the regulation of the MMP-9 gene expression, including sites that bind the transcription factors AP-1 (located at -79 and -533 bp), NF-κB (-600 bp), and Sp1 (-588 bp) (22Sato H.

Renal cell carcinoma is a common renal malignancy, and no specific therapy presently is available for treating advanced renal cell carcinoma or tumor recurrence. It has been shown that MMP-9 expression correlates with invasion and metastasis of renal carcinoma cells, but the mechanisms regulating expression in this and other tumors are poorly understood (24Lein M.

Because early diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma would enhance treatment, we are interested in the expression and activity of markers like MMPs for the detection and treatment of renal cell carcinoma. In the studies described here, a human renal carcinoma cell line (Caki-1) was used to investigate the pathways that regulate MMP-9 expression. When Caki-1 cells are stimulated by PMA, expression of MMPs, particularly MMP-9, is enhanced greatly. Here we describe the molecular mechanism by which ASC blocks expression of MMP-9 in Caki-1 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Materials—Caki-1 (human renal carcinoma), Chang (human liver cells), MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma), and U2OS (osteosarcoma) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES buffer, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. ASC produced by A. viciae was purified as described previously (1Tamura G. Suzuki S. Takatsuki A. Ando K. Arima K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1968; 21: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Lipofectamine reagent was obtained from Invitrogen. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assay systems were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). PMA, dexamethasone and α-lipoic acid were purchased from Sigma. Specific PKC, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 inhibitors (Go6976, PD98059, SP600125, and SB203580, respectively) were obtained from Calbiochem.Cytotoxicity Assays—Reduction of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Roche Applied Science) assays were performed as described in the supplier's protocol to evaluate the cytotoxicity of ASC.Cell Invasion Assays—5 × 104 cells/chamber were used for each invasion assay. The upper parts of the Transwell (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with 30 μl of a 1:2 mixture of Matrigel: phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were plated on the Matrigel-coated Transwells in the presence of various concentrations of ASC. The inserts were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells that had invaded the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Random fields were counted by light microscopy under a high power field (×200).Gelatin Substrate Gel Zymography—To determine the effect of ASC on PMA-induced MMP-9 activity, cells were treated with various concentrations of ASC in the presence of 50 nm PMA, and MMP-9 expression was evaluated by zymography. Zymography was performed using a previously described the procedure with minor modifications (26Chung T.W. Lee Y.C. Kim C.H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1123-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Caki-1 cells were suspended in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated at 3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish. The dishes were incubated until the cultures were 80% confluent; the medium then was changed to fresh serum-free medium with or without ASC compounds. Supernatants were collected after incubation for 24 h. The medium was subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels that had been copolymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed several times in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 μm ZnCl2. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (0.25%) (Bio-Rad) for 1 h and then destained. Proteolytic activity was evidenced as clear bands against the blue background of the stained gelatin.Western Blot Analysis—Cellular lysates were prepared by suspending 3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish in 30 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm aprotinin, and 20 μm leupeptin, adjusted to pH 8.0). The cells were disrupted and extracted at 4 °C for 30 min. The proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bredford, MA). Detection of specific proteins was carried out by enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). MMP-9, MMP-2, p38, PKC, JNK/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), ERK1/2, c-Fos, c-Jun, Fra-1, and ATF2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphospecific ERK1/2, p38, and JNK/SAPK antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted by RNA ZolBee (Invitrogen). For reverse transcription reaction, cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR primers are described below. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide. Used primers in RT-PCR are described in Ahn et al. (30Ahn J.D. Morishita R. Kaneda Y. Kim H.S. Chang Y.C. Lee K.U.

The AP-1 and NF-κB reporter constructs were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish and grown overnight. Cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of various plasmid constructs and 1 μg of the pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid for 5 h using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, the cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum medium with vehicle (Me2SO) or ASC for 24 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized for β-galactosidase activity in cell lysates and expressed as the average of three independent experiments.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Cultured cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and suspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 15 min on ice, the cells were vortexed in the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The nuclear pellet was then collected by centrifugation and extracted with buffer B (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min at 4 °C. The nuclear extracts (10 μg) were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min with a 100-fold excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide consensus sequence of AP-1, NF-κB, and SP-1. After this time the reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in 25 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.05 m NaCl, and 2.5% glycerol with 1 μg of poly(dI/dC) and 5 fmol (2×104 cpm) of a probe end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Probes included 30-mer oligonucleotides encompassing the consensus sequences for AP-1, NF-κB, and SP-1. The reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis at 4 °C in 6% polyacrylamide gels using a TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) running buffer. Gels were rinsed with water, dried, and exposed to x-ray film overnight.In Vitro Kinase Assay of ERK and JNK—Cells (5-10 × 106 cells) detached from a dish were washed with 0.9% NaCl, centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C, and lysed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, and 0.3 units/ml aprotinin. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C and stored at -80 °C. The immunoprecipitates were immobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C overnight. The pellet was washed twice with the lysis buffer, suspended in kinase assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 units/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate), and mixed with either 20 μg of c-Jun (for JNK assay) or 20 μg of Elk-1 protein (for ERK-1 assay), 5 μCi of [32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× Laemmli buffer, and the sample was boiled, centrifuged, and separated by electrophoresis. The gels were washed, dried, and analyzed by a phosphorimaging analyzer.Synthesis of AP-1 Decoy ODNs and Selection of Target Sequences—ODNs included the transcriptional factor AP-1 binding sequence (underlined below (in this paragraph)) at the central site and dummy sequences upstream and downstream of the binding sequence. As described (29Shiratsuchi T. Ishibashi H. Shirasuna K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Ahn J.D. Morishita R. Kaneda Y. Kim H.S. Chang Y.C. Lee K.U. Park J.Y. Lee H.W. Kim Y.H. Lee I.K. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 1682-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), double-stranded ODNs were prepared and designated as the AP-1 decoy. A mutant AP-1 (mt-AP-1) decoy with ODNs that were mutated at two bases (small letters) of the AP-1 binding sequence was used as a control. Inspection of the resulting nucleotide sequences in transcriptional regulation databases revealed no homology with other known transcription factors. AP-1 decoy, single-stranded sequence, 5′-TGTCTGACTCATGTC-3′; mt-AP-1 decoy, 5′-TGTCTctCTgATGTC-3′. 100 nm decoy ODN was transferred to cells by Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSEffect of ASC on Proliferation and Invasion of Caki-1 Cells—The structure of ASC used in this study is shown in Fig. 1A. Because it was known to have antibiotic activity, we first tested the cytotoxic effects of ASC in Caki-1 cells in serum-free and 10% serum-containing medium using an MTT assay. Treatment of cells with ASC ranging in concentration from 1 to 100 μm showed a 10-12% decrease in cell viability in serum containing medium and a 12-15% decrease in cell viability in serum-free medium (Fig. 1B). We next used a cell invasion assay to begin analysis of the anti-tumor activity of ASC. As shown in Fig. 1C, treatment of Caki-1 cells with PMA stimulated invasion about 5-fold. ASC inhibited PMA-dependent invasion in a dose-dependent manner, with inhibition in ASC-treated cells reaching the levels of control cells by 10-30 μm. These results indicated that ASC counteracts the effects of PMA on induction of invasive activity in Caki-1 cells.ASC Inhibits MMP-9 Activity in a Dose-dependent Manner—Reduced invasion activity by ASC prompted us to examine the effect of ASC on proMMP-9 activity induced by PMA. Caki-1 cells, which release proMMP-2 and proMMP-9 when cultured in serum-free medium, were treated with various concentrations of PMA for 24 h. The level of proMMP-2 expression was not significantly altered by PMA (50 nm), but the expression of proMMP-9 was induced, as evidenced by gelatin zymography (Fig. 2A and data not shown). This concentration of PMA had no effect on cell growth. From 1 to 50 μm ASC caused dose-dependent decreases in PMA-induced proMMP-9 activity; the activity of proMMP-2 also was decreased but only at higher doses.Fig. 2Effect of ASC, dexamethasone, and α-lipoic acid on proMMP-9 activity. Caki-1, Chang, MDA-MB-231, and U2OS cells were treated with various concentrations of ASC (A), dexamethasone (Dexa, B), or α-lipoic acid (Lipo, C) in the presence of PMA (50 nm). Conditioned medium was collected from cultures after 24 h and analyzed by gelatin zymography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the inhibitory effect of ASC on proMMP-9 activity is a general phenomenon, Chang, MDA-MB-231, and U2OS cells were tested for sensitivity to ASC. Chang cells secrete MMP-2 constitutively in a manner similar to Caki-1 cells, whereas MDA-MB-231 and U2OS cells constitutively secrete primarily MMP-9. Increased activity of proMMP-9 in response to PMA (50 nm) was dramatically decreased by ASC in each cell line (Fig. 2A). As for Caki-1 cells, the effect on proMMP-2 activity was less dramatic. These results indicated that the ASC effect on proMMP-9 activity is not cell type-specific.We next compared the effects of ASC to other known MMP-9 inhibitors that suppress AP-1 activity. Caki-1 cells were treated with dexamethasone in the presence of PMA, and proMMP-9 expression was evaluated by zymography as described previously (21Yoon S.O. Kim M.M. Chung A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20085-20092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 31liu Wei Andrew G.H. Jeffrey M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 15: 1005-1013Crossref Google Scholar). Treatment with dexamethasone decreased proMMP-9 activity in a dose-dependent manner; proMMP2 activity was not affected. α-Lipoic acid, another inhibitor of MMP-9 (32Woo J.H. Park J.W. Lee S.H. Kim Y.H. Lee I.K. Gabrielson E Lee S.H. Lee H.J. Kho Y.H. Kwon T.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3430-3434PubMed Google Scholar), decreased both proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that ASC is more selective for MMP-9 than these known inhibitors.ASC Inhibits Expression of MMP-9—The levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 proteins were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). The expression levels of MMP-9 protein gradually decreased in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that reduced proMMP-9 enzyme activity was the result of decreased amounts of MMP-9 protein. As before, ASC had less dramatic effects on expression of MMP-2.Fig. 3ASC inhibits PMA-induced MMP-9 expression. A, expression of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in Caki-1 cells treated with vehicle and ASC in the presence of PMA for 24 h was evaluated by Western blot analysis using anti-MMP-9 and MMP-2 antibodies. Expression of β-actin in cell lysates was used as a control. B, using RT-PCR, the levels of MMP-9, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA from cells treated as indicated were determined; a representative result from three independent experiments is shown. C, Caki-1 cells were transfected with WT-MMP-9 promoter-containing reporter vector and incubated with various concentrations of ASC in the absence or presence of PMA (50 nm) as indicated. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfection. Values represent the mean of at least three independent experiments; bars,±S.D. Results were statistically significant (*, p < 0.05 compared with control; **, p < 0.01 compared with PMA only treatment) using Student's t test.

Values represent the mean of at least three independent experiments; bars, ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the inhibition of MMP-9 enzyme expression by ASC was due to a decreased level of transcription, we performed RT-PCR and reporter gene analyses. In RT-PCR analysis, the treatment of Caki-1 cells with ASC decreased the levels of PMA-stimulated MMP-9 mRNA expression (Fig. 3B). Because the activities of MMP-9 are also tightly regulated by endogenous inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (16Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Hewitt R. Corcoran M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 33Kazes I. Elalamy I. Sraer J.D. Hatmi M. Nguyen G. Blood. 2000; 96: 3064-3069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the levels of expression of TIMP-1 and -2 RNA were assessed by RT-PCR. ASC had no effect on TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA expression at the concentrations tested (Fig. 3B).The effect of ASC on MMP-9 promoter activity was also investigated using Caki-1 cells that had been transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter gene linked to the MMP-9 promoter sequence. As shown in Fig. 3C, luciferase gene expression was activated up to 50-fold in cells treated with PMA as compared with untreated cells. Treatment of cells with ASC (10 μm) decreased PMA-mediated luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that ASC inhibits MMP-9 expression at the transcriptional level and that the MMP-9 promoter contains ASC response elements. ASC had little effect on a luciferase reported gene containing the MMP-2 (Fig. 3D).Effects of ASC on AP-1 and NF-κB Activities—The MMP-9 promoter contains cis-acting regulatory elements for transcription factors that include two AP-1 sites (located at -79 bp and -533 bp) and an NF-κB site (located at -600 bp). To test which of these transcription factors may regulate the MMP-9 gene in Caki-1 cells, cells were transiently transfected with reporter genes that included the wild type (WT) MMP-9 promoter or promoters with mutations in one or both AP-1 sites or the NF-κB site (Fig. 4A). The mutation of the AP-1 binding site at -533 bp drastically decreased induction by PMA, and mutation of both AP-1 binding sites completely abolished the activation of the MMP-9 promoter by PMA. Mutation of the NF-κB binding site also decreased PMA-induced MMP-9 reporter gene activity but not to the extent achieved by mutation of the AP-1 sites. Treatment with 10 μm ASC in the presence of PMA also decreased MMP-9 activity in reporters with AP-1 and NF-κB site mutations.Fig. 4Effects of ASC on the activities that function through AP-1 and NF-κB binding sites. A, mutations were introduced in the NF-κB or AP-1 binding sites of pGL2-MMP-9WT by 2-bp changes. Caki-1 were transfected with pGL2-MMP-9WT or pGL2-MMP-9mNF-κB or pGL2-MMP-9mAP-1 reporter plasmids and then cultured with PMA (50 nm) and ASC (10 μm). Caki-1 cells transfected with the indicated reporters were cultured with ASC (10 μm) and/or PMA (50 nm) for 24 h, and luciferase activity in cell extracts was then determined. Values represent the mean of at least three independent experiments; bars, ± S.D. Results were statistically significant (*, p < 0.05 compared with control) using Student's t test. B and C, Caki-1 cells were transfected with reporter vectors containing binding sites for AP-1 (B) or NF-κB (C) and cultured in the presence of ASC for 24 h, and luciferase activity was measured. Values represent the mean of at least three independent experiments; bars,± S.D. Results were statistically significant (*, p < 0.05 compared with control) using Student's t test.View Large Image"

Although the well studied enzymes from higher animals serve to detoxify sulfite that arises from the catabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, the bacterial enzymes have a central role in converting sulfite formed during dissimilatory oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds. Here we describe the structure of the Starkeya novella sulfite dehydrogenase, a heterodimeric complex of the catalytic molybdopterin subunit and a c-type cytochrome subunit, that reveals the molecular mechanism of intramolecular electron transfer in sulfite-oxidizing enzymes. The close approach of the two redox centers in the protein complex (Mo-Fe distance 16.6 Å) allows for rapid electron transfer via tunnelling or aided by the protein environment. The high resolution structure of the complex has allowed the identification of potential through-bond pathways for electron transfer including a direct link via Arg-55A and/or an aromatic-mediated pathway.

The enzymes typically contain a molybdopterin cofactor (Moco) implicated in substrate binding and oxidation and a heme cofactor for molybdenum reoxidation. Three types of sulfite-oxidizing enzymes have been characterized so far, namely the homodimeric, heme b and molybdenum-containing enzymes from higher animals and birds (1Rajagopalan K.V.

During catalysis two electrons are transferred from the substrate, sulfite, to the fully oxidized Mo(VI) form of the active site, which is then reduced to the Mo(IV) state. The two electrons are then transferred sequentially from the molybdenum to an electron acceptor (PSO) or to the heme cofactor, which can be present either as a domain (e.g. CSO, human sulfite oxidase (HSO)) or subunit (e.g. bacterial sulfite dehydrogenase) of the enzyme. Using the structural information and the results from site-directed mutagenesis studies on HSO (7Feng C.J. Wilson H.L. Hurley J.K. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. J. Biol.

Intramolecular electron transfer (IET) between Moco and the heme is fundamental to the function of the mammalian and bacterial enzymes; however, the electron transfer pathway between the molybdenum and the heme cofactor has not yet been determined. One reason for this is the way in which the heme domain is attached to the rest of the protein in CSO and HSO, namely as a separate domain that is connected to the Moco/dimerization domains of the protein by a flexible linker that allows for extensive changes in its position relative to the other two domains of the protein. In fact, in the published CSO structure the position of the heme domain is removed from the active site (2Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H.

This distance cannot be expected to allow for efficient electron transfer, and this enzyme structure has been presumed to be in a “redox-inactive” state. The viscosity of the medium has a marked effect on IET in CSO, which suggests that domain movement is essential for catalysis in this protein (11Feng C.J. Kedia R.V. Hazzard J.T. Hurley J.K.

At present, it is unknown how the heme domain of the vertebrate enzymes is attached to the Moco domain during transfer of electrons or how this domain interacts with its external electron acceptor, cytochrome c. Here we present a description of the crystal structures of the reduced state of the heterodimeric sulfite dehydrogenase (SorAB) from the soil bacterium Starkeya novella (4Kappler U. Bennett B.

This structure is the first for a multisubunit sulfite-oxidizing enzyme and allows direct insights into the electron transfer pathway between the molybdenum and heme centers and the nature of the subunit interface in such enzymes. Purification and Crystallization—Recombinant sulfite dehydrogenase was purified and crystallized as described previously (12Kappler U. Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2070-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To generate fully oxidized protein samples, purified protein was mixed with excess cytochrome c (horse heart, C-7752, Sigma), incubated on ice for 1 h and then subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 6/60 prep grade, GE Healthcare) to remove the horse heart cytochrome. Data Collection—Data were collected on beamlines at the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley and at the SRS, Daresbury Laboratory. Although three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected for the sodium bromide-soaked crystal, only one peak wavelength was used in the structure determination. All data were processed using the program Mosflm (13Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, Version 6.2.3.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The crystal structure has been determined by a combination of molecular replacement and heavy atom substitution. The search model for molecular replacement was derived from the structure of CSO (PDB entry 1SOX). The best molecular replacement solution, determined using the program MOLREP (15Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 16Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4137) Google Scholar), was obtained using the Moco domain of CSO (residues 106-308) modified by truncation of protein side chains to the atoms common between the two proteins. The position of the dimerization domain (residues 316-453) was subsequently determined using the program FFFEAR (17Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Several low occupancy heavy atom sites in the derivatives could be determined from the positions of consistent peaks in heavy atom difference and anomalous difference Fourier maps calculated using the molecular replacement phases. The position of the cytochrome iron was also determined from anomalous difference Fourier maps using data collected on the high energy side of the iron absorption edge. The combined molecular replacement and multiple isomorphous replacement phases were used with the native 1.8 Å resolution data as the starting point for automated model building using ARP/wARP (18Perrakis A. Morris R.J. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) generating a model comprising 460 residues. The remaining residues and the cofactors were built manually using the program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Refinement was completed using the program REFMAC (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar), and refinement statistics are given in Table I. The native data in Table I were used for structure determination and refinement. The organic part of Moco is very well defined; however, the molybdenum is not fully occupied in this crystal, and refinement with an occupancy of 0.6 gave a reasonable model. The final models consist of residues 1-373 of the SorA subunit, residues 1-81 of the SorB subunit, one Moco, one c-type heme, a sulfate ion, and water molecules. Three cis-peptide bonds were identified at positions Pro-31A, Pro-114A and Pro-200A of the SorA chain, and a disulfide bond is present between Cys-243A and Cys-245A, close to the protein surface. The structures have good stereochemistry with 99.7% of the residues in the most favored and additionally allowed regions and no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined by PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The structures are well ordered throughout, as represented by the relatively low thermal parameters, and shown by the electron density maps (Fig. 1). Illustrations of the protein structure were produced with the program Pymol (DeLano Scientific). Cytochrome-oxidized and Sulfite-reduced Enzyme—Several attempts were made to determine structures of SorAB in the oxidized and reduced states (Table I and “Experimental Procedures”). Addition of either oxidant (ferricyanide, data not shown) or sulfite to the protein during crystallization appeared to lead to a damaged active site with loss of molybdenum. Subsequent structures of cytochrome-oxidized enzyme and crystals reduced with sulfite for 1-2 min before cryocooling avoided these problems and yielded structures with fully occupied molybdenum sites. Coordinates—Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 2blf and 2bpb). Overall Structure of SorAB—The structure of the SorAB sulfite dehydrogenase has been determined using a combination of molecular replacement and isomorphous replacement (Table I). The structures of cytochrome-oxidized and sulfite-reduced enzyme showed no significant differences, and both structures appear compatible with the reduced state of Moco, possibly because of photoreduction by the x-rays during data collection. Details of the structure described in this paper are from the model refined against the sulfite-reduced data in Table I. SorAB is a complex of two subunits: SorA, a Moco binding subunit, and SorB, a cytochrome subunit (Fig. 2) (4Kappler U. Bennett B. Rethmeier J. Schwarz G. Deutzmann R. McEwan A.G. Dahl C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13202-13212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). SorA, the catalytic subunit, contains two domains that resemble the homologous domains of CSO and PSO (2Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H.

As seen in those structures, domain 1 (residues 1-254) has a mixed α/β-fold and is responsible for binding Moco (Fig. 3), whereas domain 2 (residues 255-373) has an antiparallel β-barrel structure with the same topology as an immunoglobulin fold. Interestingly, one long loop of domain 2 that deviates from the core immunoglobulin fold stretches down into the Moco domain and contributes to the surface of the substrate binding channel (Fig. 1B). Domain 2 is responsible for formation of the dimerization interface in the homodimeric eukaryotic sulfite oxidases but has no immediately apparent function in SorAB.Fig. 3Moco domain.

Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5575) Google Scholar) and is predominantly α-helical in character with the exception of the N-terminal residues, which extend away from the core of the subunit and wrap around the Moco domain. SorB contains the typical heme binding motif of a type I cytochrome c, namely the consensus sequence CXXCH close to the N terminus, and binds a single c-type heme with histidine-methionine axial coordination. The heme group is covalently attached by thioether bonds to the two conserved cysteine residues Cys-29B and Cys-32B. A search of the RSCB protein data bank (www.rscb.org/pdb) found that SorB is most similar to the N-terminal subdomain of chain A of quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase from Paracoccus denitrificans (PDB entry 1jju) (23Datta S. Mori Y. Takagi K. Kawaguchi K. Chen Z.W. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Ikeda T. Kano K. Tanizawa K. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14268-14273Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which shares 28% sequence identity. This subdomain is half of a diheme cytochrome domain and 58 Cα atoms can be structurally aligned with an r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å. One common feature of these cytochromes is the absence of long loops between helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4, which are present in the majority of single heme bacterial c-type cytochromes and shield the heme cofactor from solvent. Thus both propionate groups of the heme moiety of SorB are exposed to water molecules, which are present at the SorA-SorB interface. Pyrrole ring C of the heme in the isolated cytochrome would also be exposed to solvent, however, in the SorAB complex, loop 160-167 provided by the Moco domain interacts with the cytochrome at this edge of the heme. With the exception of closely related sulfite dehydrogenase cytochromes, SorB has low homology and poor structural alignment with other monodomain c-type cytochromes. Interactions between SorA and SorB—The SorAB complex can be purified from S. novella and is stable and active, suggesting a subunit interaction that is both specific and of relatively high affinity. This is the first example of a sulfite-oxidizing protein where the cytochrome is present as a separate subunit and in a position to carry out physiological IET, and therefore the nature of the subunit interface in the complex is of some interest. The cytochrome interacts only with the Moco domain of SorA, forming an interface composed of two distinct contact regions. One region involves interactions between the core of the cytochrome and SorA, whereas the second contact region is provided by the N-terminal arm of the cytochrome (residues 1-10), which extends 25 Å along the surface of SorA (Fig. 2, B and C) and is reminiscent of the NapB subunit of the heterodimeric periplasmic nitrate reductase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (24Arnoux P. Sabaty M. Alric J. Frangioni B. Guigliarelli B. Adriano J.M. Pignol D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The total solvent-accessible surface area buried on complex formation is 2800 Å2, with approximately two-thirds contributed by region 1 and one-third by region 2. Such extensive protein-protein interactions are commensurate with a permanent heterodimeric complex (25Jones S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 272: 121-132Crossref Scopus (520) Google Scholar). A total of 30 direct hydrogen bonds, including two salt bridges (Arg-30A-Glu-10B and Arg-55A-propionate-6B), are formed at the subunit interface, a large number compared with an average of 10 hydrogen bonds/interface in a recent study of 75 protein-protein complexes (26Conte L.L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar) One of the salt bridges, between Arg-30A and Glu-10B, is at the junction between the arm and core of the cytochrome, and both residues are conserved in SorAB-related sequences. The interface between the core of the cytochrome and SorA covers one-half of an elongated cleft leading to the substrate binding site of SorA. However, the cytochrome does not make close contact with SorA in this cleft, thus, solvent and substrate are able to access the channel between the two subunits on one side of the interface (Fig. 2B). The heme moiety, particularly propionate-6, protrudes into this channel exposing the heme to solvent and enabling formation of the second salt bridge between Arg-55A and the heme propionate. The two salt bridges contribute to the formation of the complementary electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the SorA and SorB subunits (Fig. 4). Comparison of the Overall Fold of SorAB, CSO, and PSO—The domains of subunit SorA have the same fold as the Moco and dimerization domains of CSO and PSO, and can be superimposed on these domains with an average r.m.s.d. of 1.34 and 1.38 Å for CSO and PSO, respectively (Fig. 5). If the Moco and dimerization domains are each superimposed independently the fit is improved, indicating a small shift in the relative positions of these domains that has not been observed in the CSO or PSO structures (Table II).Table IISuperposition of Moco and dimerization domains of SorAB on CSO and PSOSorAB residuesCSOPSONumber Cαr.m.s.d.Number Cαr.m.s.d.ÅÅSorA residues 1-3732801.342881.38SorA Moco domain residues 1-2541820.831880.97SorA domain II residues 255-373980.911001.11CSO Moco and dimerization domains3520.98 Open table in a new tab Although the Cα atoms in the secondary structural elements of all three sulfite-oxidizing enzymes align well, there are large differences in four surface loops (Fig. 3, Fig. 5A) and the position of the respective N termini. Loops 1 and 2, residues 145-150 and 315-318 (SorA numbering), exhibit large differences in all three proteins and are not involved in any known interactions. A third loop, residues 159-167, is also different in all three proteins, and in SorAB this loop and the N-terminal residues 9-19 form interactions with the cytochrome subunit. Of particular interest are the structural differences observed for the fourth loop, residues 239-254, which adopts the same conformation in CSO and PSO and forms interactions at the dimer interface of these enzymes. In the heterodimeric SorAB this loop contains an unconserved disulfide bond between Cys-243A and Cys-245A, and the altered conformation causes steric hindrance that likely prevents the formation of a similar dimer interface in SorAB. The question arises as to what the function of this domain and the dimerization seen in all other SOs so far is, as it is obviously not necessary for catalytic function in SorAB, which is a highly active and specific sulfite dehydrogenase. A major difference observed when SorAB is superimposed on CSO is the position of the cytochrome subunit relative to the Moco domain and the active site (Fig. 5B). Although in the CSO structure the heme b domain is located 32 Å from the molybdenum site, in our model, the cytochrome subunit interacts strongly with the Moco domain adjacent to the active site and forms one side of the channel leading to the substrate binding site. The relative position of the SorA and SorB subunits allows a very close approach of the two cofactors. The Mo-Fe distance is 16.6 Å, and the closest approach between the molybdenum and the edge of the heme cofactor is 8.5 Å. The short Moco-heme distance and the presence of strong electrostatic interactions between the two subunits clearly suggest that they are in the physiological positions for catalysis (27Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). A comparison of the cytochromes of CSO and SorAB shows that despite the different topology, they have similar features including relatively exposed heme groups (Fig. 5, C and D). In fact, the position of SorB is similar to a suggested physiological position for the CSO heme b domain (28Pacheco A. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Enemark J.E. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Attempts to fit the cytochrome domain of CSO into that position by superposition of the CSO heme moiety on the SorAB heme generated only minor steric clashes. Based on these results it seems likely that the b-type cytochrome of CSO docks close to the CSO active site and that the exposed heme propionate is involved in a heme-Arg interaction similar to that seen for SorA-SorB. Molybdopterin Cofactor—SorAB has a single, tricyclic molybdopterin cofactor that is tightly bound and buried in the Moco domain. The molybdopterin is not conjugated to a nucleotide moiety, which is present in most known bacterial molybdoenzymes except those belonging to the xanthine oxidase family (29McEwan A.G. Kappler U. McDevitt C.A. Zannoni D. Respiration in Archaea and Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht2004: 175-202Google Scholar, 30Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkuhler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure. 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). There are a total of 13 hydrogen bonds between the organic and phosphate moieties of the cofactor and the protein. With the exception of the conservative substitution of Asn-197A in SorA for His-283 of CSO, the residues with side chains involved in Moco binding are conserved with other sulfite oxidases and plant nitrate reductases (Fig. 3) (2Kisker C.

The molybdenum has five ligands arranged in an approximate square pyramidal geometry, two dithiolene sulfurs contributed from the molybdopterin, Cys-104A S-γ, an axial oxo group, and a second equatorial oxygen, which is probably a hydroxo or water molecule based on the dista"

Understanding the mechanism of action of such compounds will provide new information on the activation process of these important receptors. Within the last 10 years, a number of studies indicate that G-protein-coupled receptors can form dimers, but the functional significance of this phenomenon remains elusive. Here we used the metabotropic glutamate receptors as a model, because these receptors, for which PAMs have been identified, are constitutive dimers. We used the quality control system of the GABAB receptor to generate metabotropic glutamate receptor dimers in which a single subunit binds a PAM. We show that one PAM/dimer is sufficient to enhance receptor activity. Such a potentiation can still be observed if the subunit unable to bind the PAM is also made unable to activate G-proteins. However, the PAM acts as a non-competitive antagonist when it binds in the subunit that cannot activate G-proteins. These data are consistent with a single heptahelical domain reaching the active state per dimer during receptor activation.

These receptors allow a wide variety of extracellular signals ranging from photons to large glycoproteins to generate intracellular responses by activating heterotrimeric G-proteins (1Bockaert J.

Although first considered as monomeric proteins, a growing number of studies are pointing out that GPCRs likely form dimers (see Refs. 2Terrillon S. Bouvier M.

This phenomenon is involved in the different stages of the GPCR “life,” including regulation of plasma membrane targeting, internalization, and recycling. However, the functional importance of dimerization in G-protein activation remains elusive. Within the large family of GPCRs, those of the class C constitute a good model to study the relevance of GPCR dimerization in G-protein activation, because all are constitutive dimers, either homodimers linked by a disulfide bridge (4Romano C.

Like any other GPCRs, these receptors possess a heptahelical domain (HD) involved in G-protein activation. However, they possess a large extracellular domain (ECD) where agonists bind.

Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) constitute a new class of synthetic ligands acting on GPCRs, which have been discovered within the last years.

Recently, we reported that PAMs act as full agonists on either mGlu or GABAB receptors deleted of their large ECD (26Binet V. Brajon C. Le Corre L. Acher F. Pin J.P. Prezeau L. J. Biol.

This indicates that PAMs can stabilize the active state of the HD, an effect inhibited by the ECD in the absence of agonist. In the present study, we have examined whether one or two PAM(s) is/are required per mGlu dimer to enhance the effect of agonists. Using a system that allows us to control the subunit composition within a defined dimer (28Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Moreover, our work brings new data supporting the proposal that only one HD within these homodimeric receptors can reach an active conformation, further demonstrating the asymmetric functioning of the dimer of HDs.

Plasmids, Mutagenesis, and Construction of Chimeric mGlu Receptors—To perform ELISA or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, a hemagglutinin (HA) or a Myc tag were introduced in the N-terminal end, right after the signal peptide of the different receptors. The construction of the N-terminal HA- or Myc-tagged rat mGlu1 or mGlu5a, pRKG5a-NHA, have been described already (6Galvez T. Duthey B. Kniazeff J. Blahos J. Rovelli G. Bettler B. Prézeau L.

The mGlu1C1, mGlu5C1, mGlu1C2, and mGlu5C2 chimera have been obtained by replacing the C terminus of HA- or Myc-mGlu1 and HA- or Myc-mGlu5a by that of GABAB1a and GABAB2, respectively (28Kniazeff J.

The mGlu5 mutant sensitive to Ro01-6128, mGlu5Ro, has been obtained by introducing three point mutations in mGlu5, P654S and S657V in the third transmembrane segment and L743V in the fifth transmembrane segment (24Knoflach F. Mutel V. Jolidon S. Kew J.N. Malherbe P. Vieira E. Wichmann J. Kemp J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13402-13407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Mutations were obtained using the QuikChange® strategy (Stratagene), and all constructions were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, 100 units/ml final concentration). Cells were transiently transfected by electroporation as described elsewhere (34Brabet I. Parmentier M-L. De Colle C. Bockaert J. Acher F. Pin J.-P. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To avoid any influence of glutamate in the assay medium released by the cells, the high affinity glutamate transporter EAAC1 was also co-transfected with the receptor. Cell Surface Quantification by ELISA—Cell surface and total cell expression of N-terminal HA-tagged receptors was quantified by ELISA as described elsewhere (27Goudet C. Gaven F. Kniazeff J. Vol C. Liu J. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Acher F. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were first fixed with paraformaldehyde, then permeabilized or not (to measure total or cell surface expression, respectively) using Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min with rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Diagnostics). Cells were then incubated with a secondary goat antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), which was further detected and quantified by chemiluminescence using Supersignal West Femto (Pierce) and a Wallac Victor2 luminescence counter (Molecular Devices, St Gregoire, France). Time-resolved (TR)-FRET Analysis—The protein-protein interaction at the surface of living cells was analyzed by TR-FRET. These experiments are based on the use of specific antibodies against each partner and labeled either with Eu3+-cryptate or with AlexaFluor 647, which allows the measurement of a FRET signal in a time-resolved manner if both fluorophores are in close proximity. The TR-FRET experiments were performed as previously described (35Maurel D. Kniazeff J. Mathis G. Trinquet E. Pin J.P. Ansanay H. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells expressing the indicated HA- or Myc-tagged receptor subunits were labeled with monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) and/or anti-Myc (9E10, American Type Culture Collection number CRL-1729) carrying either Eu3+-cryptate pyridine bipyridine or AlexaFluor 647 (provided by Cis Bio International Research). Fluorescence of Eu3+-cryptate and TR-FRET signals were measured at 620 and 665 nm, respectively, 50 μs after excitation at 337 nm, using a RubyStar fluorometer (BMG Labtechnologies, Champigny-sur-Marne, France). In parallel, the total fluorescence emitted at 682 nm by the bound Alexa647 antibodies was quantified after excitation at 640 nm using an Analyst™ reader (Molecular Devices). The FRET signal was measured as ΔR using the following equation, Δr = [(R665/620)POS – (R665/620)NEG], where (R665/620)POS is the ratio of the 665 nm signal over that at 620 nm measured in the presence of both antibodies, and (R665/620)NEG is the same ratio measured in the absence of the acceptor-labeled antibody. Functionnal Assays—Inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and measurement of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in transfected cells were performed in 96-well microplates as already described (27Goudet C. Gaven F. Kniazeff J. Vol C. Liu J. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Acher F. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The dose-response curves were fitted using the GraphPad Prism program and the following equation, y = [(ymax – ymin)/(1 + (x/EC50)n)] + ymin, where EC50 is the concentration of the compound necessary to obtain the half-maximal effect and n is the Hill coefficient. The aim of the present study was to determine whether one PAM is sufficient to enhance the effect of agonist on a mGlu dimer or if two PAMs (one/monomer) are required. To answer this question, we first aimed at generating a mGlu5 dimer in which only one subunit is sensitive to the mGlu1 PAM Ro01-6128. Construction of a mGlu5 Triple Mutant (mGlu5Ro) Sensitive to Ro01-6128 —Ro01-6128 and DFB are known specific PAMs of mGlu1 and mGlu5, respectively (24Knoflach F. Mutel V. Jolidon S. Kew J.N.

Accordingly, the EC50 value of quisqualate (a potent mGlu1 and mGlu5 agonist) on mGlu1 was significantly decreased in the presence of Ro01-6128 but not in the presence of DFB (Fig. 1A). Conversely, DFB significantly decreased the EC50 value of quisqualate on mGlu5, whereas Ro01-6128 had no effect (Fig. 1B). To have access to a mGlu5 receptor sensitive to the mGlu1 PAM, three point mutations were introduced into the mGlu5 HD according to Knoflach et al. (24Knoflach F. Mutel V. Jolidon S. Kew J.N. Malherbe P. Vieira E. Wichmann J. Kemp J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13402-13407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). As described previously, this mGlu5Ro mutant was sensitive to Ro01-6128, although the increase in agonist potency is not as large as that measured on mGlu1 but retained its sensitivity to DFB (Fig. 1C). Generation of mGlu5Ro:mGlu5 Heterodimers—By co-expressing mGlu5Ro and mGlu5 in the same cells, one is expecting that ∼50% of the surface receptors correspond to the mGlu5Ro:mGlu5 heterodimer. To largely increase the proportion of this receptor combination, we took advantage of the quality control system of the GABAB receptor. Indeed in this heterodimeric receptor the GABAB1 subunit is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum unless its cytoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum retention signal is masked by the C-terminal tail of the associated GABAB2 subunit (7Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We previously reported that this quality control system can be transferred to mGlu receptors by swapping their C-terminal tail by that of GABAB1 (C1) or GABAB2 (C2) (28Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Hlavackova V. Goudet C. Kniazeff J. Zikova A. Maurel D. Vol C. Trojanova J. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Blahos J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, our previous data demonstrated that the G-protein-coupling efficacies of mGlu receptors bearing either the C1 or C2 tail were equivalent. Here, we swapped the C-terminal tail of mGlu5Ro for that of GABAB1. This mGlu5RoC1 subunit does not reach the cell surface, unless co-expressed with mGlu5C2 that possesses the C-terminal tail of GABAB2, as shown by ELISA performed on intact cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and functional analysis (data not shown) (28Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Hlavackova V. Goudet C. Kniazeff J. Zikova A. Maurel D. Vol C. Trojanova J. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Blahos J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The presence of the HA-mGlu5RoC1:myc-mGlu5C2 dimers at the cell surface was verified by a HTRF approach (35Maurel D. Kniazeff J. Mathis G. Trinquet E. Pin J.P. Ansanay H. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), using anti-HA and anti-myc antibodies labeled with europium-cryptate and AlexaFluor 647, respectively (Fig. 2C). No such a HTRF signal was measured in cells expressing HA-mGlu5 and myc-V2 receptors despite a similar expression level of these two receptors, demonstrating the specificity of this assay (data not shown) (28Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Moreover, although a clear HTRF signal was obtained in cells expressing HA-mGlu5 using anti-HA antibodies labeled with either the donor or acceptor fluorophores, no such signal could be detected in cells co-expressing HA-mGlu5RoC1 and myc-mGlu5C2 (Fig. 2C). This demonstrates the absence of HA-mGlu5RoC1 homodimers at the cell surface. Although mGlu5C2 dimers are expected to reach the cell surface in cells expressing both this subunit and mGlu5RoC1, the proportion of mGlu5C2 homodimers can be maintained to a minimum by transfecting the cells with a higher proportion of mGlu5RoC1 plasmid (29Hlavackova V. Goudet C. Kniazeff J. Zikova A. Maurel D. Vol C. Trojanova J. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Blahos J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Ro01-6128 Acts as a Positive Allosteric Modulator of the mGlu5RoC1:mGlu5C2 Dimer—In cells co-expressing mGlu5RoC1 and mGlu5C2, both Ro01-6128 and DFB significantly enhanced the potency of quisqualate (Fig. 2D). Because in these cells only the mGlu5RoC1:mGlu5C2 combination and mGlu5C2 homodimers reach the cell surface, the potentiation observed with Ro01-6128 can only result from its action on the mGlu5RoC1:mGlu5C2 heterodimers. This indicates that a single PAM per dimer can lead to a clear enhancement of agonist potency. Of interest, the potentiation observed with Ro01-6128 is similar to that measured on homodimeric mGlu5Ro, suggesting that a single PAM is sufficient for the full enhancement of agonist action on the dimer. In agreement with this possibility, DFB that binds in both mGlu5RoC1 and mGlu5C2 subunits displays a similar effect as Ro01-6128 in cells expressing these two subunits (Fig. 2D). Generation of Heterodimeric mGlu1:mGlu5 Receptors—To further confirm that a single PAM per dimer can potentiate the activity of these receptors, we aimed at generating a receptor dimer in which each subunit can be targeted by a specific PAM. To that aim, we examined whether a mGlu1:mGlu5 heterodimer could be generated in cells co-transfected with HA-mGlu1C1 and Myc-mGlu5C2 or with HA-mGlu5C1 and Myc-mGlu1C2. As shown in Fig. 3A, although mGlu1C1 and mGlu5C1 expressed alone are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, mGlu5C2 and mGlu1C2 allow the surface targeting of mGlu1C1 and mGlu5C1, respectively. As described above, the presence of HA-mGlu1C1:myc-mGlu5C2 and HA-mGlu5C1: myc-mGlu1C2 heterodimers at the cell surface was clearly demonstrated with the HTRF approach using anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies labeled with donor or acceptor fluorophores (Fig. 3B). In addition, mGlu1C1 or mGlu5C1 homodimers could not be detected with this technique in these same cells. Because no mGlu1:mGlu5 heterodimers have been reported with the wild-type subunits (4Romano C. Yang W-L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), the replacement of the C-terminal tails of these receptors by those of GABAB1 and GABAB2 is sufficient to allow the formation of such heterodimers. Heterodimeric mGlu1:mGlu5 Receptors Are Positively Modulated by Both Ro01-6128 and DFB—As shown in Fig. 3, both the mGlu1 and mGlu5 PAMs potentiated the effect of quisqualate in cells co-expressing mGlu1C1 and mGlu5C2 (Fig. 3C) and in cells co-expressing mGlu5C1 and mGlu1C2 (Fig. 3D), as indicated by the increase in agonist potency (decrease of the EC50). In cells expressing mGlu1C1 and mGlu5C2, the potentiation by Ro01-6128 can only result from the effect of this PAM on the mGlu1C1:mGlu5C2 heterodimer, because this receptor combination is the only one at the cell surface containing a Ro01-6128 binding site. Similarly, the effect of DFB on cells expressing mGlu5C1 and mGlu1C2 can only result from the enhancement of the agonist potency at the mGlu5C1:mGlu1C2. This further demonstrates that a single PAM per dimer is sufficient to enhance agonist potency at these receptors. Of interest, when both PAMs were added simultaneously, no significant further potentiation was observed, suggesting that a single PAM per dimer is sufficient for the full enhancement of the receptor dimers activity (Fig. 3, C and D). Generation of Heterodimeric mGlu Receptors in Which One Subunit Is Unable to Activate G-proteins—Because our data demonstrate that one PAM is sufficient to positively modulate the activation of mGlu dimers, we next aimed at examining the effect of PAMs on receptor dimers in which one subunit is unable to activate G-proteins. We previously reported that a point mutation (F781P) in the third intracellular loop of mGlu1 receptors prevents their ability to activate G-proteins (29Hlavackova V. Goudet C. Kniazeff J. Zikova A. Maurel D. Vol C. Trojanova J. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Blahos J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5615-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Such a mutation was introduced in myc-mGlu1C2 and the corresponding mutant named myc-mGlu1XC2. This mutant receptor was correctly trafficked to the cell surface but no longer activate phospholipase C (data not shown) (28Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Hlavackova V. Goudet C. Kniazeff J. Zikova A. Maurel D. Vol C. Trojanova J. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Blahos J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). mGlu1XC2 allowed the plasma membrane insertion of HA-mGlu5C1 and the presence of HA-mGlu5C1:myc-mGlu1XC2 heterodimers at the cell surface was confirmed by the large HTRF signal (data not shown). Moreover, the co-expression of these subunits leads to the formation of functional receptors (Fig. 4). Such functional response can only results from the heteromeric C1:C2 combination, because the C2 homodimers do not activate G-proteins because of the mutation in their third intracellular loop, and the C1 dimers are retained inside the cell. PAMs Act as Non-competitive Antagonists when Interacting in the Subunit Unable to Activate G-proteins—As shown in Fig. 4, the mGlu5 PAM DFB enhanced agonist activity at the mGlu5C1:mGlu1XC2 combination, indicating that potentiation can be observed when PAMs bind in the functional HD. Of interest, when the PAM binds in the HD unable to activate G-proteins, then it acts as a non-competitive antagonist rather than a positive modulator. Indeed, the mGlu1 PAM Ro01-6128 decreases the maximal agonist effect on the mGlu5C1: mGlu1XC2 combination (Fig. 4). These results are not because of a particularity of Ro01-6128 itself, because similar results were obtained using XITA, another mGlu1-selective PAM (data not shown). We previously demonstrated that PAMs of class C GPCRs act by stabilizing the active conformation of the HD (26Binet V. Brajon C. Le Corre L. Acher F. Pin J.P. Prezeau L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29085-29091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 27Goudet C. Gaven F. Kniazeff J. Vol C. Liu J. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Acher F. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). By using the quality control system of the GABAB receptor incorporated in mGlu receptor subunits, we generated receptor dimers containing a single binding site for a PAM. Using this approach, we show here that a single PAM per dimer is sufficient to fully potentiate receptor activity, further demonstrating the asymmetric functioning of the dimer of HDs within this class of GPCRs. To generate mGlu dimers possessing a single site for a PAM, we first mutated the mGlu5 receptor to make it sensitive to the mGlu1 PAM Ro01-6128. In agreement with published data the three mutations introduced in TM3 and TM5 were sufficient to allow Ro01-6128 to enhance agonist potency on the mGlu5 receptor. However, these three mutations did not prevent the effect of the mGlu5-selective PAM DFB, indicating that the residues responsible for the selectivity of Ro01-6128 and DFB are not at the same position in the mGlu1 and mGlu5 HD. Accordingly, either Ro01-6128 and DFB bind at different sites, or they bind differently in a similar binding pocket. By examining in more details the divergence between mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors at the level of the proposed Ro01-6128 binding pocket, additional positions can be identified that may possibly be involved in the selective action of DFB. As previously reported, the exchange of the C-terminal tail of mGlu receptors by that of either GABAB1 (C1) or GABAB2 (C2), allows to largely increase the proportion of receptor dimers composed of two defined subunits at the cell surface. Indeed, the receptors possessing the C1 tail reach the cell surface only when associated with the receptor chimera containing the C2 tail. Such heterodimers can be detected at the cell surface with the HTRF approach, and because a disulfide bridge linked the subunits of a mGlu dimer, such heterodimers are not expected to dissociate at the cell surface. Indeed, no homodimers of subunits bearing the C1 tail can be detected with the HTRF technology. Of interest, this approach also allows the formation of mGlu1:mGlu5 heterodimers. This is in contrast with what has been reported with the full-length wild-type subunits (4Romano C. Yang W-L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). This suggests that the C-terminal tails of these receptors play a major role in their selective interaction. In agreement with this proposal, mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors mostly differ at the level of their C-terminal tails. Whereas the sequence identity between the ECDs and HDs of these two receptors is 75%, it is less than 30% for the C-terminal tails. Further supporting the involvement of the C-terminal tail in the control of mGlu receptor dimer formation, the mGlu1a and mGlu1b receptor splice variants that differ in their C-terminal tail only have been shown not to form heterodimers (38Robbins M.J. Ciruela F. Rhodes A. McIlhinney R.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the formation of the mGlu1:mGlu5 dimer is the consequence of a strong coiled-coil interaction between the GABAB1 and GABAB2 C-tails. Using this approach, we show that a single PAM per dimer can augment the potency of agonists. This is nicely illustrated by the increase in quisqualate potency by Ro01-6128 in cells co-expressing mGlu5RoC1 and mGlu5C2, and in cells co-expressing mGlu1C1 and mGlu5C2. Indeed, at the surface of these cells, only the C1:C2 heterodimers possess a binding site for Ro01-6128 and, moreover, a single site per dimer. Similarly, the mGlu5-selective PAM, DFB, increases agonist potency in cells expressing mGlu5C1 and mGlu1C2. Of interest, the potentiating effect of a single PAM per dimer is similar to that obtained with receptor dimers in which two PAMs can theoretically bind per dimer. This suggests that a single PAM per dimer is sufficient for the full enhancement. In agreement with this proposal, the presence of both mGlu1 and mGlu5 PAMs in cells expressing mGlu1:mGlu5 heterodimers did not further increase the potentiation obtained with the most efficient PAM applied alone. Because PAMs have been shown to stabilize the active conformation of the HD of either mGlu5 (6Galvez T. Duthey B. Kniazeff J. Blahos J. Rovelli G. Bettler B. Prézeau L. Pin J-P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) or GABAB2 (26Binet V. Brajon C. Le Corre L. Acher F. Pin J.P. Prezeau L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29085-29091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) receptors, and because a single PAM per dimer appears sufficient for the full activity, one may propose that a single HD per dimer is turned into an active conformation during activation of these dimeric receptors. This is consistent with our previous study showing that two antagonists interacting in the HD are required to inhibit activity of mGlu dimers (29Hlavackova V. Goudet C. Kniazeff J. Zikova A. Maurel D. Vol C. Trojanova J. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Blahos J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This plus other data described below nicely fit with the proposal that the dimer of HD functions in an asymmetrical way, a single HD being activated at a time. As illustrated in Fig. 5 using the mGlu1: mGlu5 heterodimer as an example, activation of this dimeric receptor with agonists leads to only one of the HD, either that of mGlu1 or that of mGlu5, in an active state. Accordingly, the binding of Ro01-6128 should favor the activation of the mGlu1 HD, whereas DFB should favor the activation of the mGlu5 HD. This is consistent with the enhancing effect of a PAM acting in mGlu5 when the mGlu1 HD is made unable to activate G-proteins by a point mutation in the third intracellular loop. Conversely, this model nicely explains the non-competitive action of PAMs acting in the subunit bearing the third intracellular loop mutation. Indeed, by binding in this subunit, the PAM is expected to favor the formation of the active conformation of this subunit and so to prevent activation of the other HD, leading to a smaller response. Further supporting this conclusion, an inverse agonist binding in the HD mutated in the third intracellular loop favors the activation of the associated subunit and as such acts as a enhancer, as described previously (29Hlavackova V. Goudet C. Kniazeff J. Zikova A. Maurel D. Vol C. Trojanova J. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Blahos J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data strongly support the asymmetric functioning of the dimer of HDs in mGlu receptors that we previously proposed (29Hlavackova V. Goudet C. Kniazeff J. Zikova A. Maurel D. Vol C. Trojanova J. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Blahos J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Such an observation is surprising considering 1) that the mGlu receptors are homodimers, and as such, symmetrical complexes and 2) that the dimer of ECDs functions in a symmetrical way, the activation of both ECDs being required for full activation of the receptor (28Kniazeff J. Bessis A.S. Maurel D. Ansanay H. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Accordingly, one has to imagine some hindrance at the level of the dimer of HDs that prevents both HDs to reach an active state at a time. This may result from some specificity of the dimer interface at that level of the receptor dimer. However, one attractive possibility is that the heterotrimeric G-protein is responsible for this effect, because this protein is not symmetric. Although highly speculative, this idea is supported by recent data on the class A GPCRs that show that a single heterotrimeric G-protein interacts with a dimer of HDs, the α-subunit contacting a first HD via its C-terminal end, whereas the second HD contacts both the N-terminal α-helix of the α-subunit as well as the β-γdimer (3Park P.S.

Sox2 was previously thought to be the sole Sox protein expressed in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Sox2 associates with Oct3/4 to maintain self-renewal of ES cells. In the current study, digital differential display identified transcripts for an additional Sox family member, Sox15, enriched in mouse ES cells. Reverse transcription-PCR confirmed that Sox15 expression is highest in undifferentiated ES cells and repressed upon differentiation. Sox15 is expressed at low levels in several tissues, including testis and muscle. In vitro studies showed that Sox15, like Sox2, associated with Oct3/4 on DNA sequences containing the octamer motif and Sox-binding site. Gel mobility shift assays and SELEX analyses showed that Sox15 binds similar DNA sequences as Sox2 but with weaker affinity. In contrast to the early embryonic lethality observed in Sox2-null mice, Sox15-null ES cells and mice were grossly normal. DNA microarray analyses revealed that Otx2, Ctgf, Ebaf, and Hrc are dysregulated in Sox15-null ES cells, however. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Sox15, but not Sox2, bound to a Sox consensus binding site within the Hrc gene.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 435-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Mouse ES cells were first established in 1981 and led to the development of knockout mouse technology (2Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6305) Google Scholar, 3Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar). Pluripotent stem cells were subsequently generated from human blastocysts in 1998 (4Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12003) Google Scholar). Their rapid growth and pluripotency make human ES cells attractive sources for cell therapy in the treatment of diseases resulting from cell dysfunction, such as type 1 diabetes and Parkinson disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying mouse ES and embryonic carcinoma (EC) cell self-renewal are targets of intense basic research (5Chambers I. Smith A.

In contrast to somatic stem cells in which self-renewal is maintained by asymmetrical cell division, the self-renewal of ES and EC cells results from symmetrical division, producing two identical pluripotent daughter cells. Several transcription factors are essential for maintaining pluripotency, including Stat3 (7Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Sox family proteins arise from a group of genes related to the mammalian testis-determining factor Sry (15Sinclair A.H. Berta P. Palmer M.S. Hawkins J.R. Griffiths B.L. Smith M.J. Foster J.W. Frischauf A.M. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N.

Nature. 1990; 346: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Sox proteins are characterized by the highly conserved high mobility group (HMG) domains that consist of 79 amino acids and are involved in DNA recognition and binding (17Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1500-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The HMG domains are also involved in the association with partner proteins (18Wilson M. Koopman P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 19Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Sox proteins play essential roles in cell differentiation, development, and organogenesis (20Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 21Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In both mice and humans, homology-based screens have identified 20 distinct Sox proteins. Sequencing of the entire human and mouse genomes failed to identify additional members of this family (22Schepers G.E. Teasdale R.D. Koopman P. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 167-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Based on primary sequence analysis as well as the presence of other structural elements, the 20 different Sox genes can be divided into eight groups (A–H). To isolate Sox proteins specific for EC cells, Yuan et al. (23Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) designed oligonucleotide primers complementary to the most conserved least degenerate regions within the HMG box. Low stringency PCR was performed with cDNA from EC cells, and amplified products were subcloned. Thirty clones were sequenced, and all arose from the HMG domain of Sox2, a group B Sox family protein. An EC cell cDNA library was screened with this fragment, and all 15 clones identified encoded Sox2. No other Sox factor cDNA clones were obtained during this screening process, even when low stringency conditions were employed. Northern blot analyses showed high expression of Sox2 in mouse EC and ES cells. Taken together, these data indicated that Sox2 is the sole Sox protein expressed in mouse EC and ES cells. Sox2 forms a complex with the POU family transcription factor Oct3/4 on the enhancer of the fibroblast growth factor 4 gene (23Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Sox2 forms similar complexes on the enhancers of other target genes, such as UTF1 (24Nishimoto M. Fukushima A. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5453-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and Fbx15 (25Tokuzawa Y. Kaiho E. Maruyama M. Takahashi K. Mitsui K. Maeda M. Niwa H. Yamanaka S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2699-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition, both Oct3/4 (26Okumura-Nakanishi S. Saito M. Niwa H. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5307-5317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and Sox2 (27Tomioka M. Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) are autoregulated by the Oct3/4-Sox2 complex. Sox2 binds to AACAA(A/T)G motifs, whereas Oct3/4 binds to ATT(A/T)GCAT motifs of the enhancers of these genes. Sox2- or Oct3/4-null embryos are lethal at the peri-implantation stages, and Sox2- or Oct3/4-null ES cells could not be established (14Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Thus, Sox2 and its association with Oct3/4 are essential for the establishment and maintenance of pluripotent embryonic cells. To better understand the processes governing mouse ES cell self-renewal, we analyzed expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases with digital differential display and identified several genes that are highly enriched in early mouse embryos and ES cells (12Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar, 25Tokuzawa Y.

Nature. 2003; 423: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ESTs encoding Sox15 (29van de Wetering M. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were found specifically in ES cells, indicating that Sox15 is expressed in ES cells in addition to Sox2. Sox15 expression has also been reported in muscle (30Beranger F. Mejean C. Moniot B. Berta P. Vandromme M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16103-16109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and testis (31Sarraj M.A. Wilmore H.P. McClive P.J. Sinclair A.H. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2003; 3: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sox15 is the single member of Sox group G, but its HMG domain is closely related to the group B Sox proteins, including Sox2 (32Koopman P. Schepers G. Brenner S. Venkatesh B. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 328: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two Sox proteins may play similar roles in ES cells. In the current study, we compared the expression, protein-protein interactions, and DNA binding of Sox15 and Sox2 in mouse ES cells. Our data showed that Sox15 and Sox2 behave similarly in vitro. However, Sox15-deficient mice developed normally, and Sox2 and Sox15 appear to regulate different sets of genes in vivo. Our results highlight the unique DNA recognition mechanisms for each Sox family transcription factor. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Japan), and PCR was carried out with Ex TaqDNA polymerase (Takara, Japan). Primers used for Sox15 were described by Sarraj et al. (31Sarraj M.A. Wilmore H.P. McClive P.J. Sinclair A.H. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2003; 3: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Other primers used were Sox2-gw-s (5′-CACCATGTATAACATGATGGAGACG-3′) and Sox2-gw-as (5′-CCAGCCCTCACATGTGCGACA-3′) for Sox2, Otx2-s (5′-CTAAAGCAACCGCCTTACGCAGTC-3′) and Otx2-as (5′-GCGGCACTTAGCTCTTCGATTCTTAAAC-3′) for Otx2, Ctgf-s (5′-GGTGAGTCCTTCCAAAGCAGCTGCAAAT-3′) and Ctgf-as (5′-GCAGTTGGCTCGCATCATAGTTGGG-3′) for Ctgf, Ebaf-s (5′-GCTTTGCTGGGCACTCTGGGTACT-3′) and Ebaf-as (5′-CCATTCCGAACACTAGCAGGTGAGTGGA-3′) for Ebaf, and Hrc-s (5′-GGACATTTCTACTGAGTTTGGCCACAAG-3′) and Hrc-as (5′-CCTCTTCATCATCTTCCTGGCTCATGGG-3′) for Hrc. Generation of Anti-Sox15 and Anti-Sox2 Antibodies—The C-terminal regions of Sox15 and Sox2, which are devoid of the HMG domains, were amplified by PCR. The primers used were anti-Sox15-s (5′-CACCTCGAGCACCGGGTCTGTCCCC-3′) and anti-Sox15-as (5′-TTAAAGGTGGGTTACTGGCAT-3′) for Sox15 and anti-Sox2-s (5′-CACCCTCATGAAGAAGGATAAGTAC-3′) and anti-Sox2-as (5′-TCACATGTGCGACAGGGGCAG-3′) for Sox2. PCR products were subcloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to construct pENTR-Sox15C and pENTER-Sox2C. These “entry” vectors were recombined with the “destination” vector pDEST17 for the expression of N-terminally histidine-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. The resulting expression vectors, pDEST17-Sox15C and pDEST17-Sox2C, were introduced into BL21-AI E. coli (Invitrogen). Purification of histidine-tagged proteins was performed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions with 8 m urea. After being dialyzed in 6 m urea, the recombinant proteins were injected into New Zealand white rabbits to generate anti-Sox15 or anti-Sox2 serum. Immunoprecipitation—The entry vectors for Sox15, Sox2, and Oct3/4 (pENTR-Sox15, pDONR-Sox2, and pDONR-oct3/4) were recombined with pCAG-IP-HA-gw and pCAG-IP-Myc-gw by LR reaction to construct pCAG-IP-HA-Sox15, pCAG-IP-HA-Sox2, and pCAG-IP-Myc-Oct3/4. These plasmids, which have the constitutive CAG promoter (33Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar), were introduced into MG1.19 cells with Lipofectamine 2000. Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (25Tokuzawa Y. Kaiho E. Maruyama M. Takahashi K. Mitsui K. Maeda M. Niwa H. Yamanaka S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2699-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were a monoclonal antibody against Myc (SC789; Santa Cruz Biochemistry) and a monoclonal antibody against hemagglutinin A (HA; SC1568; Roche Applied Science). Western Blot Analyses—Cell lysates were collected with M-Per (Pierce), separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Corp.). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with primary antibodies in TBST with 0.5% skim milk overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies used were anti-Sox15 serum (1:100 dilution), anti-Sox2 serum (1:1000), anti-Myc antibody (1:600), and anti-HA (1:600). The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:3000, SC2030; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signal was detected with ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents (RPN2106; Amersham Biosciences). Sox2-Sox15 Chimeric Protein—To construct Sox2/15 chimeric proteins, three fragments (N terminus, HMG, and C terminus of Sox2 or Sox15) were amplified with primers containing annealing sites to each other. The primers used were Sox2-gw-s (5′-CACCATGTATAACATGATGGAGACG-3′) and Sox2HMG15-out-as (5′-ATGGGCCGCTTCACCTTCTCCGGGCTGTTCTTCTGGTTGC-3′) for Sox2 N terminus, Sox2-HMG15-hmg-s (5′-GCAACCAGAAGAACAGCCCGGAGAAGGTGAAGCGGCCCAT-3′) and Sox2HMG15-hmg-as (5′-TTATCCTTCTTCATGAGCGTGTTTTTGCTCTTACGCCGGG-3′) for Sox15 HMG, Sox2HMG-15-out-s (5′-CCCGGCGTAAGAGCAAAAACACGCTCATGAAGAAGGATAA-3′) and Sox2-gw-as (5′-CC AGCCCTCACATGTGCGACA-3′) for Sox2 C terminus, Sox15-gw-s (5′-CACCATGGCGCTGACCAGCTCCTCACAA-3′) and Sox15-HMG2-out-as (5′-ATGGGCCTCTTGACGCGGTCCAGCGGAAGTCCCCCAGACG-3′) for Sox15 N terminus, Sox15HM-G2-hmg-s (5′-CGTCTGGGGGACTTCCGCTGGACCGCGTCAAGAGGCCCAT-3′) and Sox15HMG2-hmg-as (5′-GGGACAGACCCGGTGCTCGACTTGGTTTTGCGCCGCGGCC-3′) for Sox2 HMG, and Sox15-HM-G2-out-s (5′-GGCCGCGGCGCAAAACCAAGTCGAGCACCGGGTCTGTCCC-3′) and Sox15-gw-as (5′-TTAAAGGTGGGTTACTGGCATGGG-3′) for Sox15 C terminus. To make Sox2-15-2, in which the HMG domain of Sox2 was replaced with that of Sox15, three PCR products (Sox2-N terminus, Sox15-HMG, and Sox2-C terminus) were mixed and reamplified with the primers Sox2-gw-s and Sox2-gw-as. To make Sox15–2-15, in which the HMG domain of Sox15 was replaced with that of Sox2, three PCR products (Sox15-N terminus, Sox2-HMG, Sox15-C terminus) were mixed and reamplified with the primers Sox15-gw-s and Sox15-gw-as. The resulting PCR products were introduced into pCAG-IP-HA to construct pCAG-IP-HA-Sox2-15-2 and pCAG-IP-HA-Sox15-2-15. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Gel mobility shift assay was performed as described (25Tokuzawa Y. Kaiho E. Maruyama M. Takahashi K. Mitsui K. Maeda M. Niwa H. Yamanaka S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2699-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The probes used for the Fgf4 enhancer were Fgf4-WT (tttaagtatcccATTAGCATccaAACAAAGagttttcta), Fgf4-Oct(m) (tttaagtatcccGGGTTACCccaAACAAAGagttttcta), Fgf4-Sox(m) (tttaagtatcccATTAGCATccaACCCAATagttttcta), and Fgf4-double(m) (tttaagtatcccGGGTTACCccaACCCAATagttttcta). The probes used for the Fbx15 enhancer were Fbx-WT (ccagatgtgcTTTATCATAACAATGgaattcctaggggct), Fbx-Oct(m) (ccagatgtgcTCCCTCATAACAATGgaattcctaggggct), Fbx-Sox(m) (ccagatgtgcTTTATCATAACCATGgaattcctaggggct). The probe used for Hrt was Hrc-S5 (cggatcatcaataaattaCAAAGTTgagaaaagggagac). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHIP) Assays—Formaldehyde was added directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), and the dishes were gently shaken on a shaker at room temperature for 8 min. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mm, and the dishes were returned to the shaker. After 5 min, dishes were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping into 3 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were discarded. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline plus 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were collected by centrifugation as above and resuspended in 5 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min before homogenization with three strokes of a glass Dounce homogenizer to release nuclei. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation as above, and the supernatants were discarded. Nuclei were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and the protease inhibitors (50 μl/15-cm dish of cells). Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and immunoprecipitation dilution buffer A (0.01% SDS, 1.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 167 mm NaCl) was added to a final volume of 750 μl. Samples were sonicated for 30 s 10 times with 1-min intervals using a Bioruptor (Cosmo bio). Chromatin samples (500 μl) were first precleared with normal mouse IgG (5 μl) in the presence of protein G-Sepharose bead slurry (60 μl of a 50/50 slurry of beads in TBS (16.7 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 167 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator, and beads were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 2000 rpm. The unbound material (chromatin) was transferred to a new tube, and 5 μg of each antibody were added. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotator, 60 μl of blocked protein G slurry were added, and incubation was continued on the rotator for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. Beads were first washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold buffer B (0.05% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and then washed once sequentially with buffer D (0.05% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl), buffer 3 (0.25 M LiCl, 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1.0% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA), and buffer C (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA). Beads were transferred to a microtube, and bound material was eluted by incubating the beads with 75 μl of elution buffer (0.1 mm sodium bicarbonate, 1.0% (w/v) SDS) with vigorous shaking for 10 min. The elution was repeated four times. The four elutants were pooled, 30 μl of 3 m NaCl and 10 μg of RNase were added, and samples were heated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the Schiff base linkage. DNA was collected by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 20 μl of water. A portion of this (0.5 μl) was used for PCR amplification with ExTaq polymerase. Primers used were Hrc-R1-U (GTCTACCACCAACCTTCCCACTCACAAC) and Hrc-R1-L (GGTGGGTCTGGCAGAGGGTCACA) for the fragment S1, Hrc-R2-U (TAAGAGAGGGACCCAGAGAAAGAAAAG) and Hrc-R2-L (CTGTCTCTCCTCTCTGAATCTGGGACTC) for S2, Hrc-R3-U (AGACAGACAGACACACAGAGAGACAGGC) and Hrc-R3-L (TCACTGTTCTGAGCTTCCGTGTTTC) for S3, Hrc-R4-U (TAGATCTGGAGGTGGTTGGTTTGGGTTC) and Hrc-R4-L (TTCAAAAGCTCTGGTGGTGACCAGCCTT) for S4, and Hrc-R5-U (CCGCCCCCTTTCCGCAGGTGCAG) and Hrc-R5-L (ATACATACCAGCCGGGTGTGCGTGTTCC) for S5. Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX)—pENTR-Sox15 or pDONR-Sox2 was recombined with pIH1119-gw to construct pIH1119-Sox15 and pIH1119-Sox2 for producing a fusion protein containing maltose-binding protein and Sox15 or Sox2. Purification of maltose-binding protein fusion proteins and SELEX were performed as previously described (12Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). Construction of Sox15 Targeting Vectors—To disrupt the mouse Sox15 gene, we inserted a cassette carrying the internal ribosome entry site and a fusion of the β-galactosidase and neomycin resistance genes (βgeo) into the single exon of the gene, upstream of the HMG domain (34Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A 1.5-kbp 5′ arm of the targeting vector was amplified by the Expand long template PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with primers sox15–5arm-s-NotI (5′-GCGGCCGCAAGACAGGATTATTAGAC-3′) and sox15–5arm-as-SpeI (5′-ACTAGTCCCCCAGACGCTCCA-3′). A 3.9-kbp 3′ arm was amplified with primers sox15–3arm-s-BamHI (5′-GGATCCGTCCCCTTTAGCCAAGAA-3′) and sox15–3arm-as-XhoI (3′-CTCGAGTTGGTGCTCTTAACCTCT-5′). The internal ribosome entry site-βgeo cassette was ligated between the two PCR fragments. A diphtheria toxin A cassette was placed downstream of the 3′ arm. The resulting targeting vector was linearized with SacII and introduced into RF8 ES cells by electroporation (35Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14041-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Genomic DNAs from G418-resistant colonies were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blot analyses. Genotyping of ES Cells and Mice—For 5′ recombination, genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membrane. A 550-bp 5′ probe was amplified with sox15-5′south-s (5′-CAGAGACGAAATCGCAGCCGC-3′) and sox15–5′southern-as (5′-CGCCTTCCTTCTCACTACAGA-3′). Hybridization with this probe resulted in an 8.0-kbp band from the wild-type locus and a 4.3-kbp band from the targeted locus. For 3′ recombination, genomic DNA was digested with MluI. An 870-bp 3′ probe was amplified with sox15-3′south-s (5′-GAGTAGCACATGCCGCCCTGAGTTCGAC-3′) and sox15–3′south-as (5′-GACCAGAAAGAAGGCCCAGCTCGGAATG-3′). Hybridization with this probe resulted in an 18.0-kbp band from the wild-type locus and an 8.8-kbp band from the targeted locus. After identifying ES cell clones that were correctly targeted, we determined genotypes of mice and ES cells with three-primer PCR. A sense primer, βgeo-screening1 (5′-AATGGGCTGACCGCTTCCTCGTGCTT-3′), was designed from the βgeo cassette to amplify the targeted locus. Another sense primer, sox15–3′-m-tail-s (5′-GATGGCGCAGCAGAACCCCAAGATGCAC-3′), was designed from the HMG domain to amplify the wild-type locus. An antisense primer, sox15–3′-m-tail-as (5′-GGGGCTCCAGCAAGGGAAGTATTATATG-3′), was designed to amplify both the wild-type and targeted loci. Amplification with these three primers produced a 1036-bp band from the wild-type locus and a 1371-bp band from the targeted locus. Generation of Sox15-null and Rescued ES Cells—ES cells deficient in Sox15 were obtained by culturing the heterozygous ES cells with a high concentration (2–6 mg/ml) of G418 (36Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To obtain rescue cells, pCAG-IP-Sox15 was transfected into Sox15-deficient ES cells by electroporation. To identify clone expressing Sox15, we screened colonies resistant to 2 μg/ml puromycin by Northern blot and Western blot analyses. DNA Microarray—Total RNA from Sox15 heterozygous ES cells and homozygous ES cells were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 hybridized to Mouse Development Microarray (Algilent) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The arrays were scanned with G2565BA Microarray Scanner System (Agilent). Hybridization was repeated with different clones. Data were analyzed with GeneSprings (Silico Genetics). To identify candidate ES cell-specific genes, we compared EST libraries derived from mouse ES cells (three libraries, 33,077 clones) and various somatic tissues (103 libraries, 1,040,493 clones) by digital differential display. Twenty Unigene clusters were found exclusively in ES cell-derived libraries. One of them (Mm. 176369) encoded Sox15. This was unexpected, since Sox2 had been recognized as the sole Sox family protein expressed in mouse ES cells. Sox15 expression is found in testis and muscle, but its expression in ES cells had not been studied. Sox15 expression was highest in two independent ES cell lines, RF8 and MG1.19, as assessed by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Its expression decreased following retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Weaker expression was also detected in stomach and skin. We confirmed the expression of Sox15 in undifferentiated ES cells at a protein level (Fig. 1B). These data show that Sox15, in addition to Sox2, is expressed in mouse ES cells. Despite occupying different Sox family groups, Sox2 and Sox15 have a high degree of sequence homology. Thus, we first examined whether Sox15 associates with Oct3/4 as well. We introduced Myc-tagged Oct3/4 into MG1.19 mouse ES cells together with either HA-tagged Sox2 or HA-Sox15. We then precipitated HA-Sox proteins with anti-HA antibody and examined whether Myc-Oct3/4 was co-precipitated. Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibody detected the association of Myc-Oct3/4 with both HA-Sox2 and HA-Sox15 (Fig. 2, upper panel). When Myc-Oct3/4 alone was introduced into cells, it was not precipitated with anti-HA antibody. The association between Oct3/4 and the Sox proteins was also observed when Oct3/4 was precipitated with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 2, lower panel). Thus, both Sox15 and Sox2 associate with Oct3/4 in mouse ES cells. We next performed a gel mobility shift assay to examine whether Sox15 binds to the enhancer regions of known Sox2 target genes (Fig. 3A). The mouse Fgf4 enhancer contains the consensus octamer motif (ATTAGCAT) and Sox binding site (AACAAAG), to which Sox2 and Oct3/4 bind synergistically (23Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). When we incubated 32P-labeled Fgf4 enhancer fragments with COS7 cell extracts expressing Oct3/4, Sox2, or both, shifted bands corresponding to an Oct3/4 monomer, a Sox2 monomer and an Oct3/4-Sox2 complex were observed, respectively. When we incubated 32P-labeled Fgf4 probe with COS7 cell extracts expressing Sox15, a shifted band was also observed. When COS7 cell extracts expressing both Sox15 and Oct3/4 were used, the shifted band migrated more slowly than Oct3/4 alone, demonstrating that Sox15 and Oct3/4 synergistically bind to the Fgf4 promoter. With probes containing point mutation in either the octamer motif or Sox-binding site, the band corresponding to the Sox15-Oct3/4 complex did not ap"
https://openalex.org/W2005793571,"The brain's endocannabinoid retrograde messenger system decreases presynaptic transmitter release, but its physiological function is uncertain. We show that endocannabinoid signaling is absent when spatially dispersed synapses are activated on rodent cerebellar Purkinje cells but that it reduces presynaptic glutamate release when nearby synapses are active. This switching of signaling according to the spatial pattern of activity is controlled by postsynaptic type I metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are activated disproportionately when glutamate spillover between synapses produces synaptic crosstalk. When spatially distributed synapses are activated, endocannabinoid inhibition of transmitter release can be rescued by inhibiting glutamate uptake to increase glutamate spillover. Endocannabinoid signaling initiated by type I metabotropic glutamate receptors is a homeostatic mechanism that detects synaptic crosstalk and downregulates glutamate release in order to promote synaptic independence."
https://openalex.org/W2055724402,"We investigated the interaction between the urokinase receptor (uPAR) and the integrin αvβ3. Vitronectin (VN) induces cell migration by binding to αvβ3, but expression of the uPAR boosts its efficacy. Thus, uPAR may regulate VN-induced cell migration by interacting laterally with αvβ3. In contrast, cells expressing a uPAR mutant lacking domain 2 do not migrate in response to VN. This effect is overcome by D2A, a synthetic peptide derived from the sequence of domain 2. In addition, D2A has chemotactic activity that requires αvβ3 and activates αvβ3-dependent signaling pathways such as the Janus kinase/Stat pathway. Moreover, D2A disrupts uPAR-αvβ3 and uPAR-α5β1 co-immunoprecipitation, indicating that it can bind both of these integrins. We also identify the chemotactically active epitope harbored by peptide D2A. Mutating two glutamic acids into two alanines generates peptide D2A-Ala, which lacks chemotactic activity but inhibits VN-, FN-, and collagen-dependent cell migration. In fact, the GEEG peptide has potent chemotactic activity, and the GAAG sequence has inhibitory capacities. In summary, we have identified an integrin-interacting sequence located in domain 2 of uPAR, which is also a new chemotactic epitope that can activate αvβ3-dependent signaling pathways and stimulate cell migration.

By binding uPA, uPAR induces migration of both adherent and nonadherent cells in culture. In uPAR-/- mice, neutrophil recruitment in response to pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is weaker than in wild type, and leukocyte recruitment to sites of acute inflammation is dramatically reduced (5Gyetko M.R.

Thus, uPAR is involved in physiological and pathological processes requiring cell migration such as angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and inflammation. Furthermore, uPAR promotes cell adhesion directly by binding vitronectin (VN), a serum and extracellular matrix molecule (9Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol.

This receptor consists of three homologous domains, and its N terminus, the domain 1, is the primary binding site for uPA. However, domain 3 is also involved, and the presence of domains 2 and 3 enhances the affinity of domain 1 for uPA (14Ploug M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1499-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). uPAR affinity for VN is also enhanced by the binding of uPA (10Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J.

Despite the lack of one domain, the dissociation constants of D1HD3 (2 nm) and D1D2 (8 nm) clones for uPA were not very different from wild type (1.5 nm) (29Riittinen L. Limongi P. Crippa M.P.

For adenoviral infection, RSMC were grown up to 60-80% confluence in 100-mm Petri dishes and infected for 3 h with recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 500 plaque-forming units/cell. The recombinant adenoviruses encoding wild-type Tyk2 and a dominant-negative deletion mutant of Tyk2 have been described (33Kusch A. Tkachuk S. Haller H. Dietz R. Gulba D.C. Lipp M. Dumler I. J.

Cells were used 2 days after the second infection. Human smooth muscle cells (AoSMC, CASMC) from the aortic and coronary arteries, respectively, were cultured according to the supplier (Clonetics, Charlotte, NC). Human ATF was kindly provided by Dr. Jack Henkin (Abbott Park, IL). Soluble human uPAR was generously supplied by Dr. Douglas Cines (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) (35Tarui T.

Human active two-chain uPA was purchased from American Diagnostica. Mouse monoclonal anti-Stat1 antibody was from BD Biosciences, Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse monoclonal anti-αvβ3 (LM 609) and anti-α5β1 antibodies, anti-mouse Ig rhodamine-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment secondary antibody, and purified human αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA).

Peptide D2A corresponds to the original human uPAR sequence 130IQEGEEGRPKDDR142, whereas in peptide D2A-Ala two glutamic acids were changed into two alanines, giving the following sequence: IQEGAAGRPKDDR. Peptide D2B has the same amino acid composition as D2A but a reverse sequence RDDKPRGEEGEQI. The sequence of the scrambled version of peptide D2A is DEIGQDKERPGRE. Synthetic peptides were obtained by PRIMM (Milan, Italy) or by Sigma Genosys. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Chemotaxis Assay—A chemotaxis assay was performed as described (19Degryse B. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F. Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modified Boyden chambers. Filters (5-μm pore size; Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg, MD) were treated with collagen I (100 μg/ml) and fibronectin (10 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science). Approximately 40,000–50,000 cells in serum-free DMEM were added to the upper well, and the chemoattractants to be tested were added to the lower well. When present, antibodies or inhibitors were added to both wells. After overnight migration at 37 °C, cells remaining on the upper surface of filters were scraped off, the filters were fixed in methanol, and the cells on the undersurface were stained in a solution of 10% (w/v) crystal violet in 20% (v/v) methanol. The experiments were performed at least twice in triplicate, and the results, expressed as -fold over control, are the mean ± S.D. of the number of cells counted in 10 high power fields per filter. Random cell migration (i.e. migration in the absence of chemoattractant) was given the arbitrary value of 100%. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—As previously described (19Degryse B. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F. Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Degryse B. Neels J.G. Czekay R-P. Aertgeerts K. Kamikubo Y. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

After stimulation, RSMC were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.5; washed three times with PBS plus 0.2% BSA; permeabilized with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mm saccharose, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 3 min at 4 °C; and washed three times with PBS plus 0.2% BSA. RSMC were incubated in PBS plus 2% BSA for 15 min at 37 °C and then with anti-Stat1 primary antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS plus 0.2% BSA, and further incubated with PBS plus 2% BSA for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then stained with the secondary TRITC-antibody and with FITC-phalloidin for visualization of filamentous actin for 30 min at 37 °C. DAPI was used to label the nucleus. Finally, after three washes with PBS plus 0.2% BSA, one with distilled water, the coverslips were mounted with 20% (w/v) Mowiol. Fluorescence photographs were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. To quantify the activation of Stat1, at least 10 random pictures were taken, nuclei positively stained for Stat1 were counted, and the data were expressed in percent. 125I-VN Cell Binding—VN was iodinated using IODO-GEN (Pierce) at 30–60 × 106 cpm/μg. Briefly, 10 μg of VN dissolved in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, were incubated with 0.5 μCi of 125I for 15 min at room temperature in a volume of 100 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of stop/elution buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 8.1, 0.1% (v/v) Chaps, and 50 μl of N-acetyl tyrosine (10 mg/ml in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4)). Labeled VN was separated from unbound 125I by gel chromatography in a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography revealed a 65-75-kDa doublet. Cells were seeded in 96-well culture dishes treated overnight with 1.5% gelatin in PBS, pH 7.4, grown to confluence in DMEM plus 10% FCS, and then serum-starved for 24 h in DMEM. Total binding was determined by incubating the cells on ice for 90 min in binding buffer (DMEM containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) plus 0.5 nm 125I-VN. Nonspecific binding was measured by competition with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled VN. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer and once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and the radioactivity was counted. Cell number was determined in parallel wells by direct counting, and the results were expressed as cpm/105 cells. Pull-down Assay—suPAR was radioiodinated (as for VN; see above) at a specific activity of 1.5 × 105 cpm/μg. A mix composed of 2 μg of either purified αvβ3 or α5β1 integrin and 2 μg of 125I-suPAR was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C in the absence (control) or in the presence of 4 μg of uPA with or without 5 μg of either D2A or D2A-Ala peptide in binding buffer (RPMI plus 0.02% BSA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; total volume 300 μl). Complexes were immmunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-αvβ3 (LM609) or anti-α5β1 monoclonal antibody (HA5) and 60 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed three times in binding buffer and extracted in reducing sample buffer, and the proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were analyzed by autoradiography and densitometry, and the results are presented as percentage of relative density units normalized to the band obtained with the addition of uPA alone (100%). Cell Adhesion Assays—The cell adhesion assay was performed using uPAR-overexpressing HEK-293 cells (both clone 14 and clone 19). Vitronectin (1 μg/ml)-coated 96-well tissue culture plates were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation at 37 °C with 2% BSA in PBS. After two washes with PBS, 3 × 105/ml cells suspended in 100 μl of DMEM plus 0.1% BSA were seeded in duplicate on protein-coated 96-well plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS, attached cells were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (Dade Diagnostics). The data were quantified by measuring absorbance at a wavelength of 570 nm. The peptides α325, scrambled α325, D2A, and D2A-Ala (100 μm) were added to the cell suspension immediately before seeding cells in the wells. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with the Prism software using Student's t test for pairwise comparisons of treatments or an analysis of variance model for the evaluation of treatments with increasing doses of a reagent. uPAR Expression Affects VN-induced Migration—We have examined the chemotactic effect of VN on control mouse cells and on the same cells transfected with human uPAR cDNA. NIH 3T3 and LB6 murine cells express only low levels of murine uPAR, whereas NIH 3T3-uPAR and LB6 clone 19 cells express 300,000 and 500,000 human receptors/cell, respectively. VN has chemotactic activity in both transfected and untransfected cells (Table I); however, an increased migratory response to VN was observed in the cells transfected with uPAR. At 5 μg/ml, VN-directed cell migration of LB6 clone 19 cells was significantly enhanced (p values <0.001) 3.3-fold, with respect to untransfected LB6 cells (Table I). Similar results were observed with NIH 3T3 and human HEK-293 cells, the latter being naturally devoid of uPAR (Table I). Thus, uPAR expression affects the migratory response to VN, in agreement with a direct role of uPAR in VN-induced chemotaxis (21Degryse B. Orlando S. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Blasi F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Table IEffect of overexpression of uPAR on VN-dependent cell migration A chemotaxis assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as percentage of control ± S.D. VN concentrations were 5 μg/ml for LB6, LB6 clone 19, LB6-D1HD3, and LB6-D1D2 and 1 μg/ml for NIH 3T3, NIH 3T3-uPAR, NIH 3T3-D1HD3, HEK-293, and HEK-293-uPAR cells.CellsExpression of human uPARNo additionVN%%LB6100 ± 2.7274 ± 3.8LB6 clone 19Wild-type uPAR165 ± 4.7906 ± 22.8NIH 3T3100 ± 2.4222.7 ± 4.8NIH 3T3-uPARWild-type uPAR134.2 ± 4.0397 ± 11.1HEK-293100 ± 3.8199.1 ± 12.8HEK-293-uPARWild-type uPAR87.1 ± 16.6393.9 ± 7.8LB6-D1HD3Mutant D1HD3-uPAR100 ± 2.0102 ± 5.1LB6-D1D2Mutant D1D2-uPAR100 ± 3.5280 ± 6.0NIH 3T3-D1HD3Mutant D1HD3-uPAR100 ± 3.0100 ± 4.0 Open table in a new tab VN-directed Cell Migration Does Not Depend on VN Binding to uPAR but Requires an Intact uPAR—Since VN binds both integrins and uPAR (9Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14746-14750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hoyer-Hansen G. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Dano K. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the effect of uPAR on VN-dependent chemotaxis might be due to an increase of VN-binding sites. To investigate this possibility, we tested pools of LB6 and NIH 3T3 cells transfected with either D1HD3-uPAR or D1D2-uPAR, two mutated forms of human uPAR lacking either domain 2 or 3, respectively. Both variants of uPAR are still able to bind human uPA, pro-uPA, or ATF (29Riittinen L. Limongi P. Crippa M.P. Conese M. Hernandez-Marrero L. Fazioli F. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since VN binding requires an intact uPAR, these mutants are not expected to bind VN (39Hoyer-Hansen G. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Dano K. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Yebra M. Parry G.C.N. Stromblad S. Mackman N. Rosenberg S. Mueller B.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol.

As expected, VN bound to LB6 clone 19 cells, but it bound very poorly to cells expressing the mutated forms of uPAR (Fig. 1A). We thus tested the relationship between VN-dependent cell migration and VN binding to the cells. In the presence of D1HD3-uPAR, VN failed to stimulate the chemotaxis of NIH 3T3 or LB6 cells even at 10 μg/ml (Fig. 1B). This effect was clone-independent, because pools of transfected cells were used rather than clones. The fact that the migratory response to VN was totally absent in D1HD3 cells is surprising, since VN stimulated 2.5-fold chemotaxis even in untransfected parental LB6 cells (Table I). The D1HD3-uPAR mutant decreased the response of the untransfected mouse cells to VN and thus appears to have a dominant negative effect on VN chemotaxis. The results with the D1D2-uPAR mutant were different. Although LB6-D1D2 cells displayed lower sensitivity to low doses of VN compared with LB6 clone 19 cells (Fig. 1B), they still responded to VN with an about 4-fold maximal stimulation at 1 μg/ml (Fig. 1B). In addition, cells transfected with D1D2-uPAR still responded to human ATF in a chemotaxis assay, whereas D1HD3 and LB6 did not (Fig. 1C). These data show that the stimulation of chemotaxis by VN did not require its interaction with uPAR. To further confirm this observation, we used VN-(40–459), a form of VN lacking the uPAR-binding SMB domain and hence unable to bind uPAR (37Okumura Y. Kamikubo Y. Curriden S.A. Wang J. Kiwada T. Futaki S. Kitagawa K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9395-9404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). VN-(40–459) stimulated cell migration as well as full-length VN (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that VN induces cell migration by binding to its own integrin receptors. This conclusion is strengthened by our previous observation that anti-αvβ3 antibodies inhibited the chemotactic effect of VN (21Degryse B. Orlando S. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Blasi F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4F). However, since anti-uPAR antibodies also inhibited VN-dependent chemotaxis (21Degryse B. Orlando S. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Blasi F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), uPAR must be also directly involved. Therefore, uPAR involvement in the migration-promoting effect of VN might be due to a lateral interaction with the integrins (26Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V.

Induction of ER stress proteins is enhanced via cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and limits complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The present study addresses another aspect of the ER unfolded protein response, i.e. activation of protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK or pancreatic ER kinase), which phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-α (eIF2α), thereby generally suppressing translation and decreasing the protein load on a damaged ER. Phosphorylation of eIF2α was enhanced significantly in glomeruli of proteinuric rats with passive Heymann nephritis, compared with control. In cultured GECs, complement induced phosphorylation of eIF2α and reduced protein synthesis, and complement-stimulated phosphorylation of eIF2α was enhanced by overexpression of cPLA2. Ischemia-reperfusion in vitro (deoxyglucose plus antimycin A followed by glucose re-exposure) also stimulated eIF2α phosphorylation and reduced protein synthesis. Complement and ischemia-reperfusion induced phosphorylation of PERK (which correlates with activation), and fibroblasts from PERK knock-out mice were more susceptible to complement- and ischemia-reperfusion-mediated cytotoxicity, as compared with wild type fibroblasts. The GEC protein, nephrin, plays a key role in maintaining glomerular permselectivity. In contrast to a general reduction in protein synthesis, translation regulated by the 5′-end of mouse nephrin mRNA during ER stress was paradoxically maintained, probably due to the presence of short open reading frames in this mRNA segment. Thus, phosphorylation of eIF2α and consequent general reduction in protein synthesis may be a novel mechanism for limiting complement- or ischemia-reperfusion-dependent GEC injury.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) 1The abbreviations used are: UPR, unfolded protein response; AA, arachidonic acid; CMV, cytomegalovirus; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2-α; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-α; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GEC, glomerular epithelial cell; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HIS, heat-inactivated human serum; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NS, normal human serum; PAN, puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis; PHN, passive Heymann nephritis; PERK, protein kinase R-like ER kinase or pancreatic ER kinase; grp, glucose-related protein. is one of several cell stress responses, which in part consists of up-regulating the capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to process abnormal proteins (1Kaufman R.J.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25935-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Following accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, or depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, activating transcription factor-6 moves to the Golgi, where it is cleaved by site-1 and site-2 proteases to yield a cytosolic fragment. The fragment migrates to the nucleus to activate transcription of ER stress proteins, e.g. the glucose-related proteins (grp), grp94 and bip (grp78), and others. In parallel, inositol requiring-1 dimerizes and activates its endoribonuclease activity. IRE1 cleaves X-box-binding protein-1 mRNA and changes the reading frame to yield a potent transcriptional activator. Under normal conditions, ER stress proteins may serve as protein chaperones for exocytosis from the ER, and they may complex with defective proteins and target them for degradation. During stress, the induction of ER stress proteins may limit accumulation of abnormal proteins in cells. A third aspect of the UPR involves PERK (protein kinase R-like ER kinase or pancreatic ER kinase), which is activated to phosphorylate the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 (eIF2α). This process reduces AUG codon recognition, and consequently, the general rate of translation is reduced (which aims at decreasing the protein load on a damaged ER), but selective mRNAs can be preferentially translated under these conditions. Current literature supports the view that bip serves as a master UPR regulator, being involved in the activation of activating transcription factor-6, inositol requiring-1, and PERK. Induction of the UPR may allow cells to recover from ER stress and may be protective to additional insults, at least in part via cross-talk with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (5Hung C.C.

However, prolonged or more substantial ER stress may lead to cell death via apoptosis (2Ron D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 4Zhang K. Kaufman R.J.

Upon activation of the complement cascade near a cell surface, there is assembly of terminal components, exposure of hydrophobic domains, and insertion of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex into the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane (6Morgan B.P.

C5b-9 assembly results in formation of transmembrane channels or rearrangement of membrane lipids with loss of membrane integrity. In nucleated cells, multiple C5b-9 complexes are required for lysis, but at lower doses, C5b-9 induces sublethal (sublytic) injury (6Morgan B.P. Curr. Top Microbiol.

At the same time, complement attack may result in activation of various pathways, including those that restrict injury or facilitate recovery (6Morgan B.P. Curr. Top Microbiol.

Based on studies in GEC culture and in vivo, C5b-9 assembly induces transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (16Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Am. J.

First, arachidonic acid (AA) released by cPLA2 is metabolized to prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2, and inhibition of prostanoid production reduces proteinuria in PHN and in human membranous nephropathy (12Cybulsky A.V. Foster M.H. Quigg R.J. Salant D.J. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2000: 2645-2697Google Scholar). Second, cPLA2 may mediate GEC injury more directly, probably by inducing damage to the membrane of the ER, and by participating in the ER stress response (10Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Liu J. Peng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41342-41351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, assembly of C5b-9 in GEC in culture and in vivo increased expression of the ER stress proteins, bip and grp94, in a cPLA2-dependent manner, and induction of these proteins restricted complement-mediated GEC injury. In addition to complement, other types of stress may injure GEC. For example, during or after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury there is up-regulation of glomerular heat shock and ER stress proteins, activation of nitric-oxide synthases, glomerular infiltration with leukocytes, and development of sclerosis (23Klausner J.M.

We demonstrate that complement, as well as ischemia-reperfusion, induce phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2α, and suppress general protein synthesis. Furthermore, activation of the PERK pathway is functionally important, because it limits complement- and ischemia-reperfusion-dependent cytotoxicity. Translation regulated by the 5′-end of nephrin mRNA was, however, maintained following ischemia-reperfusion injury.

To construct pEGFP-N5′(391bp)-enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), a 391-nucleotide fragment corresponding to the mouse nephrin 5′-flanking region (nucleotides –391 to 1) was produced using PCR. The primers were 5′-CTGGGCTCGAGCAATGCTCAGTGCTG-3′ (forward-1) and 5′-CGCGGATCCCATCACCAGCAGCTTGTTGT-3′ (reverse-1). The ∼8.5-kb nephrin 5′-flanking DNA served as template. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and BamHI restriction enzymes, and was subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N3, between the 589-nucleotide cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter region (contained within the vector), and GFP. To mutate three ATG sequences in the 391-bp nephrin 5′-flanking fragment, two PCRs were performed using the 5′-end of nephrin DNA as template. In the first reaction, the forward primer was the same as above, except that the ATG sequence was changed to ATA (forward-1A), and the reverse primer was 5′-TGACTGTCGCAGTCTTTCTGTCCCGGGATCGCCTTT-3′ (reverse-2). In the second reaction, the primers were 5′-CAGAAAGACTGCGACAGTCACAGACATTGGTAGGAA-3′ (forward-2), and reverse-1. Single base substitutions were introduced into primers forward-2 and reverse-2 to remove ATG sequences (bold letters). Products of the two PCRs were allowed to anneal (as the forward-2 and reverse-2 primers contain 20 overlapping nucleotides), and then the nephrin 5′-flanking fragment containing three mutated ATG sequences was produced using PCR and the primers forward-1A and reverse-1. An additional construct that contained a 1.25-kb fragment of the 5′-end of nephrin, subcloned into pEGFP (at XhoI and BamHI sites), was produced as above (using PCR and the ∼8.5-kb nephrin 5′-flanking DNA as template). Primers were 5′-AAGCACTCGAGAGGTGAGAGGTTTGTAG-3′ and reverse-1. Cell Culture and Transfection—Rat GEC culture and characterization has been published previously (17Cybulsky A.V. Monge J.C. Papillon J.

Compared with neo GECs, PLA2 activity is increased ∼5-fold in GECs overexpressing cPLA2, but is nevertheless within a physiological range. PERK knock-out and wild type fibroblasts, and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum.

Incubation with Complement and in Vitro Ischemia-reperfusion— The standard protocol involved incubation of GECs in monolayer culture with rabbit anti-GEC antiserum (5% v/v) in modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer, containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for 40 min at 22 °C (10Cybulsky A.V.

GECs were then incubated with normal human serum (NS; diluted in Krebs-Henseleit buffer), or heat-inactivated (decomplemented) human serum (HIS; 56 °C, 30 min) in controls, for 40 min at 37 °C. Except for studies of cytolysis, experiments were carried out at concentrations of complement that induced minimal or no lysis (NS at 2.5–4.0% v/v). As in previous studies, we have generally used heterologous complement to minimize possible signaling via complement-regulatory proteins, although we have demonstrated that homologous complement can also induce activation of analogous pathways (17Cybulsky A.V.

In vitro ischemia-reperfusion or chemical anoxia/recovery was induced by incubating cells in glucose-free medium with 2-deoxyglucose (10 mm) plus antimycin A (10 μm) for 90 min (anoxia). Then, cells were incubated in glucose-replete medium for 30 min, 4 h, or 24 h (recovery) (10Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Liu J. Peng H. J. Biol.

Urine was collected on day 14, and rats were then sacrificed and glomeruli were isolated by differential sieving. All rats with PHN and PAN had heavy proteinuria (urine protein > 100 mg/day; normal < 20) All studies were approved by the McGill University Animal Care Committee. Measurement of free [3H]AA—GEC phospholipids were labeled to isotopic equilibrium with [3H]AA for 48–72 h, as detailed previously (17Cybulsky A.V. Monge J.C. Papillon J. McTavish A.J. Am. J.

Lipids were extracted from ∼1 × 106 cells and cell supernatants. Methods for extraction and separation of radiolabeled lipids (e.g. [3H]AA) by thin layer chromatography are published (17Cybulsky A.V.

Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Northern Hybridization—Preparation of GEC and glomerular lysates and cell fractions was described previously (16Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J.

After incubation, ∼6 × 106 GECs were lysed, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with primary antiserum. Immune complexes were incubated with agarose-coupled protein A. Complexes were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose paper, blocked with 5% milk, and incubated with primary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin, and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Protein content was quantified by scanning densitometry, using National Institutes of Health Image software. Preliminary studies demonstrated that there was a linear relationship between densitometric measurements and the amounts of protein loaded onto gels. Northern hybridization was performed as described previously (10Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Liu J. Peng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41342-41351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent. RNA was separated by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose containing 1.9% formaldehyde) and was transferred to an Immobilon-Ny+ membrane (Millipore). The coding region of GFP cDNA was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer method. Membranes were hybridized in buffer containing 7% SDS, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.1, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1–2 × 106 cpm/ml radiolabeled probe for 16 h at 42 °C. Membranes were washed in 1× SSPE buffer (180 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8) with 0.5% SDS twice for 5 min at 22 °C, and then 0.2× SSPE buffer with 0.2% SDS, twice for 15 min at 68 °C. Membranes were exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at –70 °C for 48–72 h. Measurement of Cytotoxicity—Complement-mediated cytolysis was determined by measuring release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), similarly to the method described previously (10Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Liu J. Peng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41342-41351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Specific release of LDH was calculated as [NS – HIS]/[100 – HIS], where NS represents the percent total LDH released into cell supernatants in incubations with NS, and HIS is the percent total LDH released into cell supernatants in incubations with HIS. By analogy, cytolysis after anoxia/recovery was calculated as [A – U]/[100 – U], where A represents the percent total LDH released into cell supernatants in cells subjected to anoxia/recovery, and U represents the percent total LDH released in untreated cells. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The t statistic was used to determine significant differences between two groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences among groups. Where significant differences were found, individual comparisons were made between groups using the t statistic, and adjusting the critical value according to the Bonferroni method. Two-way analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences in multiple measurements among groups. Complement Induces Phosphorylation of eIF2α and a Reduction in Protein Synthesis—In an earlier study, we demonstrated that expression of ER stress proteins (bip and grp94) was increased in PHN, an in vivo model of C5b-9-induced GEC injury (10Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Liu J. Peng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41342-41351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine if other aspects of the UPR were activated by C5b-9, we examined phosphorylation of eIF2α on serine 51 in rats with PHN at day 14, a time point when these rats show heavy proteinuria. There was significantly greater phosphorylation of eIF2α in glomeruli isolated from rats with PHN, as compared with control glomeruli (Fig. 1). Further studies to delineate the mechanisms of eIF2α phosphorylation were carried out in cultured GECs. Previously, we showed that complement induced expression of ER stress proteins in cultured GECs and that the induction was dependent on C5b-9 assembly (10Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A.

We found that β2-chimerin messenger levels are significantly down-regulated in human breast cancer cell lines as well as in breast tumors. Adenoviral delivery of β2-chimerin into MCF-7 breast cancer cells leads to inhibition of proliferation and G1 cell cycle arrest. Mechanistic studies show that the effect involves the reduction in Rac-GTP levels, cyclin D1 expression, and retinoblastoma dephosphorylation. Studies using the mutated forms of β2-chimerin revealed that these effects were entirely dependent on its C-terminal GAP domain and Rac-GAP activity. Moreover, MCF-7 cells stably expressing active Rac (V12Rac1) but not RhoA (V14RhoA) were insensitive to β2-chimerin-induced inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle progression. The modulation of G1/S progression by β2-chimerin not only implies an essential role for Rac in breast cancer cell proliferation but also raises the intriguing possibility that diacylglycerol-regulated non-protein kinase C pathways can negatively impact proliferation mechanisms controlled by Rho GTPases. β2-Chimerin is a member of the “non-protein kinase C” intracellular receptors for the second messenger diacylglycerol and the phorbol esters that is yet poorly characterized, particularly in the context of signaling pathways involved in proliferation and cancer progression. β2-Chimerin possesses a C-terminal Rac-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) domain that accelerates the hydrolysis of GTP from the Rac GTPase, leading to its inactivation.

Structurally, chimerins possess a C1 domain highly homologous to those of PKC isozymes (the DAG/phorbol ester binding site) and a C-terminal GAP domain. The α2- and β2-chimerins also have a N-terminal Src homology 2 domain of unknown function, which is not present in the splice variants α1-(or n-) and β1-chimerins (5Kazanietz M.G. Mol.

Very little information is available regarding the regulation, expression, and function of β2-chimerin or the other chimerin isoforms as well as their role in proliferation mechanisms and cancer progression. We have been focusing our attention on β2-chimerin, because there is emerging evidence that this isoform is directly regulated by phorbol esters (4Caloca M.J. Fernandez N. Lewin N.E. Ching D.

Miller D.W. Barnett G.H. Hahn J.F. Williams B.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3456-3461PubMed Google Scholar) but its relevance in other cancer models is still unknown. In vitro studies have shown that the C-terminal domain of chimerins is capable of accelerating GTP hydrolysis from the small GTPase Rac1 without affecting the activity of RhoA or Cdc42 GTPases (9Diekmann D.

J. 2003; 375: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our recent studies in COS cells revealed that β2-chimerin decreases cellular Rac-GTP levels and inhibits the elevation of Rac-GTP levels caused by epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10Caloca M.J. Wang H.

Rac GTPase is known to act as a molecular switch, cycling between an active GTP-bound state (Rac-GTP) and an inactive GDP-bound state (Rac-GDP). This switch is regulated by three groups of molecules: 1) guanine nucleotide exchange factors, such as Vav and Tiam-1, that promote its conversion to the active GTP-bound form; 2) guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors; and 3) GAPs, which stimulate intrinsic GTPase activity, thus leading to Rac inactivation (12Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar, 13Ridley A.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Active Rac interacts with various effectors to initiate downstream signaling events that control the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton reorganization, migration, adhesion, and gene expression (14Hall A.

Moreover, Rac and other members of the Rho GTPase family are overexpressed in human tumors such as in breast cancer (26Fritz G. Just I. Kaina B. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 27Schnelzer A. Prechtel D. Knaus U. Dehne K. Gerhard M. Graeff H. Harbeck N. Schmitt M. Lengyel E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and hyperactivation of Rac leading to a higher rate of cell proliferation has been found in cellular models of human breast cancer (28Mira J.P. Benard V. Groffen J. Sanders L.C. Knaus U.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Targeted expression of an activated Rac mutant in mammary epithelium causes mammary gland lesions (29Leung K. Nagy A. Gonzalez-Gomez I. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Kaartinen V. Cells Tissues Organs. 2003; 175: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, there is strong evidence that Rac effectors such as p21-activated kinase 1 are dysregulated in breast cancer cells (30Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest critical implications of Rac in tumorigenesis, particularly in models of breast cancer. In this paper, we investigated the expression of the DAG/phorbol ester receptor β2-chimerin in breast cancer and its role in proliferation. We have found that β2-chimerin mRNA levels are strikingly reduced in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. By means of adenoviral delivery into MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we have found that β2-chimerin, but not the mutated forms lacking Rac-GAP activity, causes a significant impairment in G1/S cell cycle progression due to a reduction in the expression levels of cyclin D1. The effect of β2-chimerin is strictly dependent on its ability to inhibit Rac function via the C-terminal GAP domain, suggesting the possibility that Rac-mediated control of cell proliferation is modulated by DAG-regulated pathways. Human Breast Non-malignant and Cancer Cell Lines—Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T-47D, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-468, Hs578T, and human breast immortalized non-malignant MCF-10A cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured as recommended by the provider. The human non-malignant breast cell line HMT-3522 and its malignant derivative T4-2 were cultured as previously described (31Wang F. Weaver V.M. Petersen O.W. Larabell C.A. Dedhar S. Briand P. Lupu R. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14821-14826Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). MCF-7-Tet-On cells were purchased from Clontech and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml G418. Examination of β2-Chimerin mRNA Levels in Human Breast Cells and Tissues—For tissue RNA, 10 pairs of high quality human breast cancer tissue total RNA and matched-normal tissue total RNA (from the same patient) were purchased from Clinomix Biosciences, Inc. (Watervliet, NY). All 10 patients were diagnosed as infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) at different stages including two Stage I IDCs (samples 1–2), two Stage II IDCs (samples 3–4), two Stage III IDCs (samples 5–6), and four Stage IV IDCs (samples 7–10). Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol and reversibly transcripted using SuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). β2-Chimerin mRNA levels were determined either by standard PCR (30 cycles) using the following primers: 5′-TGATCTCAAGAGGATCAAGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGGAATAGGTATCATATGTG-3′ (reverse), which specifically amplify a 297-bp fragment of β2-chimerin. Primers used for real-time PCR (Q-PCR) are described elsewhere (32Lorenzano Menna P. Skilton G. Leskow F.C. Alonso D.F. Gomez D.E. Kazanietz M.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2284-2291PubMed Google Scholar). The real-time PCR reactions were plated in triplicate and performed in 384-well plates using the ABI 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used for normalization (32Lorenzano Menna P. Skilton G. Leskow F.C. Alonso D.F. Gomez D.E. Kazanietz M.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2284-2291PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of Adenoviruses (AdVs)—AdVs were generated with the AdEasy™ adenoviral vector system (Stratagene). Generation of the β2-chimerin and β-GAP AdVs was described elsewhere (10Caloca M.J. Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 32Lorenzano Menna P. Skilton G. Leskow F.C. Alonso D.F. Gomez D.E. Kazanietz M.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2284-2291PubMed Google Scholar). For the generation of ΔEIE-β2-chimerin adenoviral construct, a XhoI-MluI insert comprising the mutant ΔEIE-β2-chimerin (10Caloca M.J. Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was ligated into pShuttle-CMV-HA. A similar strategy was used for the generation of an AdV for the mutant I130A-β2-chimerin (33Canagarajah B. Leskow F.C. Ho J.Y. Mischak H. Saidi L.F. Kazanietz M.G. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2004; 119: 407-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A control LacZ-AdV was generated from pShuttle-CMV-LacZ (provided by the kit) and therefore has the same backbone as the β2-chimerin AdVs. For adenoviral infections, MCF-7 cells in 6-well plates growing in serum-free DMEM were infected with various AdVs for 16 h. AdVs were removed after extensive washing, and experiments were performed 48 h later. Generation of Stable Cell Lines Expressing Constitutively Active Small GTPases—Stable cell lines expressing active mutants of Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA were generated upon transfection of MCF-7-Tet-On cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) followed by G418/hygromycin selection. The following plasmids were used: pTRE-HA (empty vector); pTRE-HA-V12Cdc42 (a kind gift from Dr. Margaret Chou, University of Pennsylvania); pTRE-HA-V12Rac1; and pTRE-HA-V14RhoA. These last two plasmids were generated by subcloning V12Rac1 (isolated from pcDNA3-V12Rac1) and V14RhoA (isolated from pXDR-HA-V14RhoA) into pTRE-HA, respectively. pcDNA3-V12 Rac1 and pXDR-HA-V14RhoA were generous gifts from Dr. Rick Assoian (University of Pennsylvania). Generation of Cyclin D1 T286A Retrovirus (D1-RetroV)—D1-RetroV was generated by co-transfecting pMX-FLAG-D1 T286A (34Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) (a cyclin D1 mutant resistant to proteolysis degradation, 10 μg) and a helper plasmid (p-Helper, 5 μg) into 293T packaging cells (generous gifts from Dr. J. A. Diehl, University of Pennsylvania). Co-transfection was performed in a 10-cm dish (5 × 106 cells/dish) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) following the instructions from the manufacturer. The medium was collected 48 h later, centrifuged (1000 × g, 5 min), and filtered with a 0.24-μm filter. A control retrovirus using pMX empty vector was also generated (V-RetroV). For retroviral infections, MCF-7 cells cultured in 6-cm dishes were infected with 3 ml of either D1-RetroV or V-RetroV in the presence of Polybrene (10 μg/ml, Sigma) for 24 h. Cell Proliferation and Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell proliferation was assessed by BrdUrd incorporation and by the MTS assay (CellTiter 96® Aqueous One solution cell proliferation assay, Promega). After overnight infection (16 h) with the different AdVs, cells were washed once with PBS and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h and then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for another 24 h. BrdUrd (Sigma) was then added into the medium for 30 min (final concentration: 0.2 mm). Cells were then collected by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and fixed with 70% ethanol for BrdUrd incorporation analysis using flow cytometry (35Pozarowski P. Darzynkiewicz Z. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 281: 301-312PubMed Google Scholar). For the MTS assay, after overnight adenoviral infection in 10-cm dishes, cells were collected using trypsin, counted, and then seeded onto 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS). MTS was added after 24, 48, or 72 h, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm (36Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). For cell cycle analysis, after overnight (16 h) adenoviral infection, cells were washed once with PBS, incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h, and then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for another 24 h. Cells were then collected by trypsinization and analyzed using flow cytometry as previously described (37Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Western Blot—15 μg of proteins were used for Western blot analysis (38Tanaka Y. Gavrielides M.V. Mitsuuchi Y. Fujii T. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33753-33762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-β2-chimerin (10Caloca M.J. Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4541-4550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); anti-Rac; anti-Cdc42; anti-cyclins A, D1, and E (Upstate Biotechnology); anti-pRb (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-HA tag (Cell Signaling); and anti-β-actin (Sigma). Rac-GTP and Cdc42-GTP Pull-down Assays—After overnight infection (16 h) with different AdVs, cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h and then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml, 1 min). Alternatively, after adenoviral infection, cells were cultured in 10% FBS DMEM for an additional 24-h period. Rac-GTP and Cdc42-GTP levels were determined with a “pull-down” assay using the PBD (p21-binding domain) of p21-activated kinase, as previously described (10Caloca M.J. Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4541-4550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and using either anti-Rac or anti-Cdc42 antibodies for detection, respectively. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using either a Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Scheffe's test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Reduced Expression of β2-Chimerin in Human Breast Cancer Cells and Tissues—The expression of β2-chimerin in normal and breast cancer cells is unknown. Using standard PCR analysis, we found high levels of β2-chimerin mRNA in non-malignant immortalized MCF-10A cells. On the other hand, in all of the cancer cell lines examined, the β2-chimerin transcript was barely detected or dramatically reduced (Fig. 1A). The results were confirmed by a quantitative analysis using Q-PCR. Indeed, β2-chimerin mRNA was not detected in MCF-7 and Hs578T cells and it was very low in T-47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 cells. Only MDA-MB-468 cells showed significant levels of β2-chimerin transcript, although much lower than MCF-10A cells (Fig. 1B). Similarly, whereas β2-chimerin mRNA was readily detected in the non-malignant breast cell line HMT3522 (31Wang F. Weaver V.M. Petersen O.W. Larabell C.A. Dedhar S. Briand P. Lupu R. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14821-14826Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), it was barely detectable in its malignant derivative (T4-2) (Fig. 1, A and B). We next examined β2-chimerin mRNA levels in a small sample of human breast cancer tissues and their corresponding matched-normal tissues (from the same patient). It was found that the expression of β2-chimerin mRNA in normal tissues was highly variable. However, among the 10 patients, the β2-chimerin transcript was significantly lower in the cancer tissues of 7 patients (Fig. 1C). Together, these results reveal a significant reduction of β2-chimerin expression in human breast cancer. Ectopic Expression of β2-Chimerin Inhibits Proliferation of MCF-7 Cells—Because Rac is known to control proliferation and there is evidence for Rac hyperactivation in breast cancer models, we examined how β2-chimerin affects human breast cancer cell proliferation. HA-tagged β2-chimerin was introduced into MCF-7 cells using an adenoviral gene delivery approach. Upon infection of MCF-7 cells with different m.o.i. of the β2-chimerin-AdV, HA-β2-chimerin was readily detected (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, β2-chimerin dose-dependently reduced BrdUrd incorporation in MCF-7 cells. On the other hand, infection with a control AdV (LacZ-AdV, 100 m.o.i.) did not change BrdUrd incorporation significantly (Fig. 2B). To begin elucidating the mechanisms involved in the β2-chimerin effect, we examined cell cycle progression (Fig. 2C). Flow cytometry analysis revealed a significantly higher percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase upon infection with the β2-chimerin-AdV compared with control (non-infected) or LacZ-AdV-infected MCF-7 cells. The effect was proportional to the m.o.i. used for infection. A concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase was observed, but no significant changes were observed in the number of cells in G2/M phase. The Anti-proliferative Effect of β2-Chimerin Is Dependent on a Functional β-GAP Domain—To examine whether the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation depends on β2-chimerin Rac-GAP activity, we expressed the C-terminal catalytic region of β2-chimerin (β-GAP domain) using an AdV. Infection of MCF-7 cells with β-GAP-AdV resulted in a m.o.i.-dependent increase in the expression of the β-GAP domain (Fig. 3A). Expression of β-GAP caused similar effects on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression as those observed with full-length β2-chimerin (Fig. 3, B and C). We then took advantage of the β2-chimerin mutant ΔEIE-β2-chimerin (deletion in positions 298–300 in the β-GAP domain), which is unable to accelerate GTP hydrolysis from Rac (10Caloca M.J. Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An AdV for the GAP-inactive ΔEIE-β2-chimerin was generated. Upon delivery into MCF-7 cells, ΔEIE-β2-chimerin-AdV was unable to inhibit BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 3, D and E). β2-Chimerin Reduces Cyclin D1 Expression and Inhibits pRb Phosphorylation—Because expression of β2-chimerin in MCF-7 cells leads to G1/S arrest, we next assessed the effect of β2-chimerin on pRb phosphorylation. The expression of β2-chimerin dose-dependently reduced pRb phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Notably, β2-chimerin significantly inhibited the expression of cyclin D1. β2-Chimerin also reduced the expression of cyclin A and caused a slight increase in cyclin E levels. On the other hand, cells infected with control LacZ-AdV (100 m.o.i.) showed no obvious alterations in cyclin expression and pRb phosphorylation. Infection of MCF-7 cells with β2-chimerin-AdV did not cause any significant changes on the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases 2, 4, and 6 (data not shown). Infection of MCF-7 cells with the β-GAP-AdV also led to a reduction in cyclin D1 levels and pRb phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). However, the Rac-GAP inactive mutant, ΔEIE-β2-chimerin, did not impair cyclin D1 expression or pRb phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of G1/S transition by β2-chimerin via its β-GAP domain involves the reduction of cyclin D1 and pRb phosphorylation levels. Inhibition of Rac by β2-Chimerin in MCF-7 Cells—β2-Chimerin has specificity for the Rac GTPase both in in vitro GAP assays and in COS-1 cells but does not affect RhoA or Cdc42 activity (10Caloca M.J. Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4541-4550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). EGF (100 ng/ml, 1 min) caused a 3.3 ± 0.5-fold (n = 3) increase in Rac-GTP levels in MCF-7 cells, which was significantly impaired by the expression of β2 chimerin. β2-Chimerin also reduced Rac-GTP levels in MCF-7 cells growing in 10% serum. The effect was proportional to the m.o.i. used for infection, and it was not observed with the GAP-inactive mutant, ΔEIE-β2-chimerin (Fig. 5A). A densitometric analysis of the β2-chimerin effect on serum-induced activation of Rac is presented in Fig. 5B. A striking correlation was observed between the inhibitory effect of β2-chimerin on Rac activity and the reduction in cyclin D1 levels by different m.o.i. of the β2-chimerin-AdV (r = 0.95). Ectopic Expression of Cyclin D1 Rescues the Anti-proliferative Effect of β2-Chimerin—To further explore the link between Rac and cyclin D1 in our experimental model, we expressed cyclin D1 using a retroviral approach (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the ectopic expression of cyclin D1 using the D1-RetroV significantly rescued the anti-proliferative effect of β2-chimerin, whereas the control retrovirus (V-RetroV) did not (Fig. 6B). MCF-7 Cells Expressing Constitutively Active Rac1 Are Insensitive to β2-Chimerin—We reasoned that the expression of a constitutively active Rac mutant in MCF-7 cells should impair the effects of β2-chimerin on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. A MCF-7 cell line stably expressing active V12Rac1 was generated (HA-V12Rac1-MCF-7) (Fig. 7A). These cells show higher levels of Rac-GTP than control (vector-transfected) cells (Fig. 7D). Interestingly, whereas β2-chimerin markedly reduced proliferation in control MCF-7 cells, HA-V12Rac1-MCF-7 cells were insensitive to β2-chimerin (Fig. 7B). Consistent with these results, adenoviral delivery of β2-chimerin into HA-V12Rac1-MCF-7 cells did not reduce cyclin D1 levels or cause pRb dephosphorylation (Fig. 7A). We then determined whether the expression of other active Rho-GTPases could rescue the effect of β2-chimerin. MCF-7 cell lines stably expressing constitutively active Cdc42 (V12Cdc42) or RhoA (V14RhoA) were generated (Fig. 7A). Similar to control MCF-7 cells, HA-V14RhoA-MCF-7 cells were highly sensitive to β2-chimerin for the inhibition of cell proliferation, reduction of cyclin D1, and Rb dephosphorylation (Fig. 7, A and B). Unexpectedly, in cells expressing active Cdc42, adenoviral delivery of β2-chimerin was unable to inhibit cell proliferation, cyclin D1 expression, and pRb phosphorylation (Fig. 7, A and B). To further examine the mechanisms involved in the protective effect of V12Cdc42, we determined Cdc42-GTP levels in response to EGF (100 μg/ml, 1 min). A 3.1 ± 0.6-fold (n = 3) increase in Cdc42-GTP levels was observed in response to the growth factor, which was not affected by the β2-chimerin-AdV, even at the highest m.o.i. used (100 plaque-forming units/cell) (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, we found that basal Rac-GTP levels were elevated in HA-V12Cdc42-MCF-7 cells (Fig. 7, D and E), which probably explain the protective effect of active Cdc42 on β2-chimerin-induced inhibition of cyclin D1 levels, pRb phosphorylation, and cell proliferation. A Hyperactive β2-Chimerin Mutant Is a Potent Inhibitor of Cyclin D1 Expression and Proliferation—Based on structural predictions gained from the recently solved structure of β2-chimerin, we generated an AdV encoding for a β2-chimerin mutant locked in the constitutively active conformation. This mutant, I130A-β2-chimerin, was shown to have constitutive Rac-GAP activity when expressed in COS-1 cells by bypassing lipid activation (33Canagarajah B. Leskow F.C. Ho J.Y. Mischak H. Saidi L.F.

We found that the sPLA2 domain alone was sufficient for its catalytic activity and for its prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-generating functions in various cell types. In several if not all cell types, the N- and C-terminal domains of sPLA2-III were proteolytically removed, leading to the production of the form containing only the sPLA2 domain, which could be further N-glycosylated at two consensus sites. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that sPLA2-III was preferentially expressed in the microvascular endothelium in human tissues with inflammation, ischemic injury, and cancer. In support of this, sPLA2-III was induced in cultured microvascular endothelial cells after stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines. Expression of sPLA2-III was also associated with various tumor cells, and colorectal cancer cells transfected with sPLA2-III exhibited enhanced PGE2 production and cell proliferation, which required sPLA2-III catalytic activity. When implanted into nude mice, the sPLA2-III-transfected cells formed larger solid tumors with increased angiogenesis compared with control cells. Moreover, small interfering RNA for sPLA2-III significantly reduced PGE2 production and proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. Taken together, these results reveal unique cell type-specific processing and N-glycosylation of sPLA2-III and the potential role of this enzyme in cancer development by stimulating tumor cell growth and angiogenesis.

To date, 11 sPLA2 enzymes have been identified in mammals (IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, XIIA, and XIIB). On a structural basis, these enzymes are further subdivided into three branches, namely groups I/II/V/X, group III, and group XII (1Murakami M. Kudo I. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 77: 163-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 2Kudo I. Murakami M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; (3-58): 68-69Google Scholar). Individual sPLA2s exhibit unique tissue and cellular localizations and enzymatic properties, suggesting their distinct, tissue-specific roles in various pathophysiological events. Human group III sPLA2 (sPLA2-III) is particularly unique among mammalian sPLA2s in that it consists of a central sPLA2 (S) domain and unique N-terminal (N) and C-terminal (C) domains, that the molecular mass of its full-length protein is estimated to be 55 kDa, and that the sPLA2 domain is homologous to bee venom group III sPLA2 rather than to other mammalian sPLA2s (3Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7492-7496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Recombinant expression of this enzyme by bacterial and mammalian cell expression systems reveals that the central S domain alone is sufficient for its enzymatic functions (3Valentin E. Ghomashchi F.

On the basis of overexpression studies using HEK293 cells, the cellular arachidonate (AA)-releasing function of sPLA2-III is similar to that of sPLA2-X, which acts primarily on the phosphatidylcholine (PC)-rich outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (4Murakami M.

Because bee venom sPLA2 does not contain N and C domains corresponding to those found in human sPLA2-III, it was anticipated that these domains in the human enzyme would be removed proteolytically, resulting in the production of the form containing only the S domain, although no experimental data that directly support this hypothesis has yet been provided. Also, there is no information as to which cell types express sPLA2-III in human tissues and which functions this enzyme exerts in particular tissue microenvironments. In an effort to address these questions, we herein examined the cellular localization and processing of sPLA2-III by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting with an antibody raised against the S domain of sPLA2-III. Our results indicate that sPLA2-III is processed to the S domain-only form in several cell types that intrinsically express this enzyme. Furthermore, we show that sPLA2-III is expressed in the microvascular endothelium in various human pathologic tissues as well as in tumor cells. These observations, together with cell biological studies, reveal the unexplored tumorigenic potential of this unique sPLA2 enzyme.

Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry of human lung was performed on autopsy specimens obtained within 3 h postmortem from three cases with normal lung structure (all male, 61–76 years old). Synovial tissue sections were obtained (with approval from the ethical committee of the University) from three patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (all female, 68–74 years old) having surgery at Toho University Ohmori Hospital. All patients were RA factor-seropositive according to the RA criteria (12Clegg D.O. Ward J.R. Scand. J.

Ishihara M. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kudo I. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 655-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or staining of serial sections with anti-CD31 and -HAM56 antibodies. Measurement of sPLA2 Activity—sPLA2 activities were assayed by measuring the amounts of radiolabeled linoleic acid released from the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (Amersham Biosciences). The substrate in ethanol was dried under an N2 stream and was dispersed in water by sonication. Each reaction mixture (total volume 250 μl) consisted of the appropriate amounts of the required samples, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm CaCl2, and 2 μm substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, [14C]linoleic acid was extracted by the Dole method, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counter, as described previously (4Murakami M.

Confocal Laser Microscopy—Cells grown to subconfluence on glass bottom dishes (Matsunami) pre-coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 1 h in TBS. After three washes with TBS, the fixed cells were treated with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.5% (w/v) saponin in TBS (blocking solution) for 1 h, with anti-sPLA2-III antibody at 1:200 dilution in blocking solution for 2 h, and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody at a 1:200 dilution in blocking solution for 2 h, with three washes in each interval. After six washes with TBS, specific immunofluorescent signals were visualized with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (IX70; Olympus). Glycosidase Treatment—Cells (5 × 106 cells) were lysed in 500 μl of 0.5% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Aliquots of the lysates were then incubated with endoglycosidase H in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) or with peptide N-glycanase F in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 12 h. Then the samples were applied to 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-sPLA2-III antibody. Experiments with sPLA2-III siRNA—A set of synthetic hairpin-forming oligonucleotides directed to human sPLA2-III was prepared: 5′-CACCGCTATGGCATCCGAAACTACTTCAAGAGAGTAGTTTCGGATGCCATAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAACTATGGCATCCGAAACTACTCTCTTGAAGTAGTTTCGGATGCCATAGC-3′ (antisense). After annealing, the oligonucleotides were subcloned into pENTER™/U6 vector (Invitrogen) using BLOCK-iT™ U6 RNA interference entry vector kit (Invitrogen). After transformation into Top10 competent cells and plasmid purification, the insert was transferred to the pAd/BLOCK-iT™-DEST vector (Invitrogen) by means of the Gateway system using LR clonase. After transformation into Top10 competent cells and plasmid purification, the plasmid was linearized with PacI and transfected into 293A cells with Lipofectamine 2000 to produce adenovirus bearing sPLA2-III siRNA. After 2–4 times amplification, the resulting adenovirus-containing media were used for subsequent analyses. Experiments with Nude Mice—HCA-7 cells (106 cells) were suspended in 100 μl of PBS and injected subcutaneously into BALB/c-nu/nu mice (6-week-old males) (Crea, Japan). After 3 weeks, the solid tumors were removed surgically and fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin. After embedding in paraffin, thin sections (4–6 μm thickness) of the tumor tissues were prepared on glass slides for histochemical analyses. sPLA2-III Is Capable of Augmenting PGE2 Production in Various Cell Types—Although our previous study (4Murakami M.

https://openalex.org/W2006415446,"Insig-1 and Insig-2, a pair of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane proteins, mediate feedback control of cholesterol synthesis through their sterol-dependent binding to the following two polytopic ER membrane proteins: sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Sterol-induced binding of Insigs to SCAP prevents the proteolytic processing of SREBPs, membrane-bound transcription factors that enhance the synthesis of cholesterol, by retaining complexes between SCAP and SREBP in the ER. Sterol-induced binding of Insigs to reductase leads to the ubiquitination and ER-associated degradation of the enzyme, thereby slowing a rate-controlling step in cholesterol synthesis. Here we report the isolation of a new line of mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells, designated SRD-15, deficient in both Insig-1 and Insig-2. The SRD-15 cells were produced by γ-irradiation of Insig-1-deficient SRD-14 cells, followed by selection in high levels of the oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol. Sterols neither inhibit SREBP processing nor promote reductase ubiquitination/degradation in SRD-15 cells. Sterol regulation of SREBP processing and reductase ubiquitination/degradation is fully restored in SRD-15 cells when they are transfected with expression plasmids encoding either Insig-1 or Insig-2. These results demonstrate an absolute requirement for Insig proteins in the regulatory system that mediates lipid homeostasis in animal cells."

https://openalex.org/W1992974034,"The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) sustains cell migration through its capacity to promote pericellular proteolysis, regulate integrin function, and mediate chemotactic signaling in response to urokinase. We have characterized the early signaling events triggered by the Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Tyr (SRSRY) chemotactic uPAR sequence. Cell exposure to SRSRY peptide promotes directional migration on vitronectin-coated filters, regardless of uPAR expression, in a specific and dose-dependent manner, with maximal effect at a concentration level as low as 10 nm. A similar concentration profile is observed in a quantitative analysis of SRSRY-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements, mostly consisting of filamentous structures localized in a single cell region. SRSRY analogues with alanine substitutions fail to drive F-actin formation and cell migration, indicating a critical role for each amino acid residue. As with ligand-dependent uPAR signaling, SRSRY stimulates protein kinase C activity and results in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The involvement of the high affinity N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe receptor (FPR) in this process is indicated by the finding that 100 nm N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe inhibits binding of D2D3 to the cell surface, as well as SRSRY-stimulated cell migration and F-actin polarization. Moreover, cell exposure to SRSRY promotes FPR-dependent vitronectin release and increased uPAR·αvβ5 vitronectin receptor physical association, indicating that αvβ5 activity is regulated by the SRSRY uPAR sequence via FPR. Finally, we provide evidence that αvβ5 is required for SRSRY-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas it is not required for protein kinase C activation. The data indicate that the ability of uPAR to stimulate cell migration and cytoskeletal rearrangements is retained by the SRSRY peptide alone and that it is supported by cross-talk between FPR and αvβ5.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5994-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The uPAR promotes cell-associated proteolysis by binding to its specific ligand, the serine protease urokinase (uPA), which locally converts plasminogen into active plasmin, thus favoring tissue invasion by tumor cells and metastasis (3Andreasen P.A.

Despite the lack of a trans-membrane domain, the uPAR is able to activate intracellular signaling, possibly by interaction with other trans-membrane receptors.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and a peptide disrupting uPAR-integrin association also prevents uPAR signaling (14Wei Y. Eble J.A. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Chapman H.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2975-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The reversible association with other receptors is supported by the lateral mobility of uPAR in the plasma membrane bilayer and its redistribution upon interaction with uPA in focal adhesions (15Wilcox-Adelman S.A. Wilkins-Port C.E. McKeown-Longo P.J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The uPAR itself is an adhesion receptor because it binds to vitronectin, an abundant component of extracellular matrix (16Sidenius N. Blasi F.

The uPAR is a member of the Ly6/α-neurotoxin/uPAR protein domain family (20Ploug M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1499-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It consists of three domains connected by linker regions of 15-20 amino acids each (21Hoyer-Hansen G. Pessara U. Holm A. Pass J. Weidle U. Dano K. Behrendt N. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The N-terminal D1 domain interacts with uPA, and it is also required for binding to vitronectin, thus suggesting the cooperation of different domains (20Ploug M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1499-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). D2 connects D1 and the C-terminal D3 domain bearing a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor (21Hoyer-Hansen G. Pessara U. Holm A. Pass J. Weidle U. Dano K. Behrendt N. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Enzymatic cleavage of the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor results in a soluble form of the receptor, which has been detected in human plasma and urine (22Sier C.F. Sidenius N. Mariani A. Aletti G.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The soluble uPAR, deprived of the D1 domain by cleavage with chymotrypsin or full-length uPA, is a potent chemoattractant for monocyte-like cells (24Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In fact, enzymatic cleavage unmasks a region with chemotactic properties, corresponding to residues 88-92 of uPAR (P88-92) (24Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F.

Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Tyr (SRSRYp) carrying this epitope has been reported to be chemotactically active (24Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Resnati et al. (26Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) have recently reported that P88-92-induced chemotaxis is mediated by the low affinity receptor for N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), a bacterial chemotactic peptide. Accordingly, the D2D388-274 uPAR fragment was identified as an endogenous ligand for FPRL1/LXA4R that is necessary and sufficient to mediate D2D388-274-dependent chemotaxis (26Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Whereas uPA-dependent cell migration requires the expression of intact uPAR including D1, fMLP-dependent cell migration requires the expression of P88-92 containing uPAR and is uPA- and D1-independent (27Montuori N. Carriero M.V. Salzano S. Rossi G. Ragno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46932-46939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To investigate the early events as well as the partners involved in the complex membrane interactions characterizing uPAR activation, we have simplified our analysis, focusing on the signaling effects of SRSRYp. We now provide evidence that SRSRYp triggers cross-talk between high affinity fMLP (FPR) and αvβ5 vitronectin receptors, resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration. Reagents—Recombinant D1 (residues 1-87), D2 (residues 88-183), D3 (residues 184-284), and D2D3 (residues 88-284) uPAR domains and the pertussis toxin (PTX) were from Calbiochem. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, RGD peptide, fMLP, calphostin C, wortmannin, LY294002, and PD98059 were from Sigma. Native human vitronectin (VN), collagen IV (CG), fibronectin (FN), and laminin (LM) were purchased from Promega. Mouse anti-ERK1 and mouse anti-ERK2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies (Abs) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. VNR147 anti-αv and P1F6 anti-αvβ5 mAbs and rabbit polyclonal anti-α1, anti-α2, anti-α3 anti-α5, and anti-αv Abs were from Chemicon International Inc. Anti-uPAR R4 mAb was a gift of Dr. Gunilla Hoyer-Hansen (Finsen Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulins, the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL), and the protein kinase C enzyme kit assay were from Amersham Biosciences. The tissue culture dishes, polycarbonate chemotaxis filters, and Boyden chambers were from Nucleopore. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides were synthesized by the solid phase approach using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology in a manual reaction vessel (28Stewart J.M. Young J.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL1984Google Scholar). The purification was achieved using a semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC C18 bonded silica column (Vydac 218TP1010). The purified peptides were 99% pure as determined by analytical reversed-phase HPLC. The correct molecular weights were confirmed by mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Peptide stability was assessed by incubating each peptide with chymotrypsin for 4 h at 37 °C and subsequently analyzing the products by reversed-phase HPLC. Peptides exhibiting enzymatic digestion of <15% were employed in the assays. Cell Cultures and Treatments—Human kidney embryonic 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 293/uPAR cells were stably transfected with the human uPAR cDNA as described by Montuori et al. (27Montuori N. Carriero M.V. Salzano S. Rossi G. Ragno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46932-46939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Subconfluent 293 and 293/uPAR cells were detached by mild trypsinization, incubated with 10% fetal calf serum-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, briefly acid-treated to avoid any interference by serum-derived membrane-bound growth factors as previously described (18Carriero M.V. Del Vecchio S. Franco P. Potena M. Chiaradonna F. Botti G. Stoppelli M.P. Salvatore M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1299-1308PubMed Google Scholar), washed with PBS, and counted. In some experiments, the cells were pre-incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 200 nm calphostin C, 25 μm PD98059, 1 μm wortmannin, or 20 μm LY294002, or they were cultured for 18 h at 37 °C with 50 ng/ml PTX. Desensitization was carried out by pre-incubating cells with 100 nm fMLP for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 as described previously (26Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). When indicated, RGD peptide (50 μg/ml) or the indicated Abs (5 μg/ml) were pre-incubated with the cell suspension for 1 h at room temperature and kept throughout the assay. Cell Migration—Subconfluent 293 and 293/uPAR cells were detached, briefly acid-treated to avoid any interference by serum-derived membrane-bound growth factors, and subjected to cell migration assays using conventional Boyden chambers (8Carriero M.V. Del Vecchio S. Capozzoli M. Franco P. Fontana L. Zannetti A. Botti G. D'Aiuto G. Salvatore M. Stoppelli M.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5307-5314PubMed Google Scholar). Migration toward the indicated chemoattractants, which were diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, was performed for 4 h using filters (pore size, 8-μm) coated with 5 μg/ml VN, unless otherwise specified. The random cell migration was considered as 100%, and directional cell migration was calculated as a percentage of the random cell migration. Analysis of Cytoskeleton—Detached and acid-treated subconfluent 293 and 293/uPAR cells were analyzed for their cytoskeletal organization upon exposure to the indicated peptides or isolated uPAR domains for 1 h at 23 °C, unless otherwise specified. Cell pellets were washed with PBS, fixed with 2.5% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C, and then incubated with 0.1 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for 40 min (8Carriero M.V. Del Vecchio S. Capozzoli M. Franco P. Fontana L. Zannetti A. Botti G. D'Aiuto G. Salvatore M. Stoppelli M.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5307-5314PubMed Google Scholar). After extensive washing with PBS, cells were placed on a clean glass slide and examined either by a fluorescence inverted microscope or by a confocal microscope (Leica). A total of 200 cells/sample were examined; cells exhibiting rhodamine-phalloidin-positive protrusions were counted and expressed as a percentage of total estimated cells. The percentages of cells exhibiting F-actin single polarizations upon exposure to effectors were subtracted of the percentage of cells exhibiting phalloidin protrusions in the absence of treatment. Binding Assay—5 μg of D2D3 were radio-iodinated with Na125I using IODO-GEN as previously described (29Del Vecchio S. Stoppelli M.P. Carriero M.V. Fonti R. Massa O. Li P.Y. Botti G. Cerra M. D'Aiuto G. Esposito G. Salvatore M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3198-3206PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeled protein was purified from unbound iodide by Sephadex G-25 chromatography, and the resulting specific activity was ∼30 μCi/μg. 293 cells (1 × 106 cells/sample) were incubated with 125I-D2D3 (1 nm) in binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 60 min, in the presence or in the absence of an increasing concentration of unlabeled D2D3 or other competitors. After extensive washing, cell-associated radioactivity was assessed in a gamma counter. Binding in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled D2D3 was subtracted to obtain the specific binding. The extent of inhibition was calculated relative to the specific binding, which was taken as 100%. Cell Adhesion—24-well flat-bottom dishes were incubated with a PBS solution containing 2.5 μg/ml LM, CG, FN, VN, or heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (-) overnight at 4 °C. Other experiments were performed using plates coated with 2.5 μg/ml D1, D2, or D3 recombinant uPAR domains. In all cases, plates were rinsed with PBS, incubated for 1 h at 23 °C with 1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin, and rinsed again. Desensitized or untreated cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded for 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO2, in the presence or absence of 10 nm SRSRYp. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-αvβ5 mAb or diluents for 1 h at 23 °C. Adherent cells were detached by trypsinization and counted. Protein Kinase C Enzyme Assay—293 cells (5 × 104 cells/sample) were detached by a mild trypsinization, exposed to 10 nm SRSRYp for 5 or 10 min at 23 °C, and then lysed in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm benzamidine. PKC activity was assessed for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.2 μCi/sample [γ-32P]ATP by a PKC kit assay (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nonspecific adsorption of [32P]ATP to filter paper was determined by omitting cell lysate (blank). The extent of PKC-dependent phosphorylation is expressed as pmol phosphate transferred/min. Western Blot—Cell lysates were prepared with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na2VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture) and cleared by centrifugation. 50 μg of proteins per sample were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with 2 μg/ml anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-α1, anti-α2, anti-α3, anti-α5, or anti-αv polyclonal Abs. Filters were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Abs for 1 h at 23 °C and detected by ECL. Total ERK1/2 was quantitated by reprobing filters with 2 μg/ml anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 mAbs. Densitometry of autoradiographic bands was analyzed using National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) Image 1.62 software. Co-immunoprecipitation—For the analysis of uPAR·αv complexes, detached and acid-treated 293/uPAR cells were exposed to 100 nm fMLP or diluents at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 30 min and then incubated with SRSRYp or diluents for 1 h. Following the indicated treatments, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm, and 400 μg/sample were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml VNR147 anti-αv mAb. The immunoprecipitated proteins recovered by absorption to protein G-Sepharose and separated onto a 10% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were performed by incubating filters with 2 μg/ml R4 anti-uPAR mAb or anti-αv polyclonal Ab for 2 h at 4 °C. Effect of the SRSRY Sequence and Isolated uPAR Domains on Cell Migration and Cytoskeleton—Within uPAR, the SRSRY sequence (residues 88-92) has been identified as having potent chemotactic activity in a number of cell lines, including murine uPAR-/- fibroblasts (24Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In an effort to dissect the molecular events underlying uPAR signaling, we first determined the optimal conditions supporting chemotaxis toward synthetic SRSRYp. In a conventional Boyden chamber assay, we tested the ability of SRSRYp to promote cell migration of human embryonic kidney 293 cells on uncoated filters or filters coated with LM, CG, FN, or VN: the 293 cell line was selected because it has no detectable uPARs (27Montuori N. Carriero M.V. Salzano S. Rossi G. Ragno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46932-46939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, 10 nm SRSRYp did not promote appreciable chemotaxis of 293 cells on uncoated or LM-coated filters, whereas a slight increase in migration was detected on CG- or FN-coated filters. On the other hand, on VN-coated filters, SRSRYp and isolated uPAR domains (D2 or D2D3) containing residues 88-92 consistently increased directional cell migration to a similar extent (Fig. 1, A and B). As expected, portions of the D1 and D3 domains that did not include residues 88-92 were ineffective (Fig. 1B). SRSRYp motogen activity exerted on VN-coated surfaces is dose-dependent, with maximal induction being obtained at about 10 nm. Interestingly, this chemotactic effect is uPAR-independent because it occurs in both uPAR-lacking and uPAR-bearing 293 cells (Fig. 1C). In order to investigate the early intracellular effects of the chemotactic SRSRY sequence, we analyzed the cytoskeletal organization of pre-adherent 293 cells and of 293/uPAR cells exposed to SRSRYp for 60 min at 23 °C. As the confocal images show, exposure to 10 nm SRSRYp strongly modified the distribution of F-actin, with the appearance of peripheral filamentous structures, resembling those observed in uPAR-bearing cell lines exposed to uPA, often localized at one pole of the cell. Light microscopy images show that rhodamine-phalloidin staining corresponds to lamellipodia-like protrusions (Fig. 2A). A similar pattern was observed when incubation was performed at 37 °C (data not shown). To extract quantitative data from these experiments, a total of 200 cells/sample were examined, and the percentage of cells exhibiting phalloidin-positive protrusions was determined. The percentage of cells exhibiting F-actin single polarization in the absence of treatment (5 ± 1%) was subtracted to obtain net effector-dependent values. A net increase in F-actin-enriched regions following exposure to D2, D2D3 uPAR domains, or SRSRYp was observed in at least 20% of the total cell population (Fig. 2B). 10 nm D2 and 10 nm D2D3 uPAR domains promoted similar cytoskeletal rearrangements, whereas D1 or D3 produced no effect. SRSRYp caused clear-cut F-actin formation, which was again uPAR-independent and dose-dependent (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Effect of SRSRY peptide on cell cytoskeletal organization. A, 293 cells were incubated with diluents (NT) or 10 nm SRSRYp for 1 h at 23 °C and subsequently stained with rhodamine-phalloidin. Representative cells for each condition are shown. Bar, 5 μm. B, histogram values correspond to the net percentage of 293 cells exhibiting F-actin single polarizations upon exposure to the indicated effectors (10 nm). C, net percentage of 293 and 293/uPAR cells exhibiting F-actin single polarizations upon exposure to the indicated picomolar concentrations of SRSRYp. Data are the average of three experiments performed in triplicate and evaluated by two independent observers, with S.E. indicated by error bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to pinpoint the functional importance of each individual amino acid in the chemotactic peptide, the I, II, III, IV, or I and III amino acid residues were substituted with alanine residues. The resulting peptides were first checked for cytotoxicity by a trypan blue assay. Then, they were tested for their ability to promote migration and cytoskeletal rearrangements of 293 and 293/uPAR cells. All modified peptides failed to increase cell motility and F-actin polarizations, showing that all five amino acids in the peptide are critical to these functions (Table I). The clear-cut biological activity of the wild type chemotactic peptide, together with the lack of activity of all Ala-substituted peptides, strongly supports an important role for the SRSRY sequence in uPAR-dependent signaling.Table IEffects of SRSRY-derived Ala-substituted peptides on cell migration and cytoskeletal organizationEffectors (10 nm)Cell migration (%)F-actin polarizations (%)293 cells293/uPAR cells293 cells293/uPAR cellsSRSRY233 ± 7208 ± 622 ± 121 + 2ARSRY122 ± 5100 ± 54 ± 32 ± 1SASRY107 ± 1101 ± 43 ± 35 ± 4SRARY104 ± 1102 ± 53 ± 24 ± 3SRSAY101 ± 6104 ± 21 ± 02 ± 2ARARY104 ± 5105 ± 121 ± 11 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Effect of Signaling Inhibitors on SRSRY-dependent Cytoskeletal Reorganization and Cell Migration—Increasing evidence supports the notion that uPAR-mediated signaling involves a number of signal transducers, including G proteins, PKC, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (6Irigoyen J.P.

https://openalex.org/W1970589415,"The mechanism of antimalarial activity of clotrimazole was studied placing emphasis on its role in inhibiting hemoperoxidase for inducing oxidative stress in Plasmodium falciparum. Clotrimazole, in the presence of H2O2, causes irreversible inactivation of the enzyme, and the inactivation follows pseudo-first order kinetics, consistent with a mechanism-based (suicide) mode. The pseudo-first order kinetic constants are ki= 2.85 μm, kinact = 0.9 min-1, and t½ = 0.77 min. The one-electron oxidation product of clotrimazole has been identified by EPR spectroscopy as the 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) adduct of the nitrogen-centered radical (aN = 15 G), and as DMPO protects against inactivation, this radical is involved in the inactivation process. Binding studies indicate that the clotrimazole oxidation product interacts at the heme moiety, and the heme-clotrimazole adduct has been dissociated from the inactivated enzyme and identified (m/z 1363) by mass analysis. We found that the inhibition of hemoperoxidase increases the accumulation of H2O2 in P. falciparum and causes oxidative stress. Furthermore, the inhibition of hemoperoxidase correlates well with the inhibition of parasite growth.

Brogden R.M. Pinder R.M. Drugs. 1975; 9: 424-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The fungistatic mechanism of CLT is associated with inhibition of sterol 14 α-demethylase and microsomal P-450-dependent enzymes (2Bossche H.V. Willemsens G. Cools W. Marichal P. Lauwers W. Biochem.

Besides antifungal activity, CLT has diverse biological actions. It shows antiproliferative effect by acting as a translation initiation inhibitor (4Natarajan A. Fan Y.H. Chen H. Guo Y. Iyasere J.

CLT effectively and rapidly inhibits growth of different strains of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro irrespective of their chloroquine sensitivity (11Saliba K.J. Kirk K. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med.

It has been suggested that the antimalarial effect may be due to its ability to cause major changes in calcium ion fluxes (13Benzaquen L.R. Brugnara C. Byers H.R. Gattoni-Celli S. Halperin J.A. Nat.

It has been proposed that CLT offers antimalarial effect by inhibiting heme catabolism in the malaria parasite and by enhancing heme-induced membrane damage (16Huy N.T. Kamei K. Yamamoto T. Kondo Y.

Inhibition of oxidized glutathione (GSSH) export from the infected human red cells or from the parasite itself is also considered to be one possible mechanism of anti-malarial effect of CLT. Efflux of GSSH from normal erythrocytes is mediated by a high affinity glutathione S-conjugate transporter, and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) and CLT inhibit the MRP1, which is present in human erythrocytes (19Klokouzas A.

H2O2 reduces parasite viability, and the susceptibility of P. falciparum to oxidant-mediated killing has been well established (24Wozencraft A.O. Dockrell H.M. Taverne J. Target G.A.T.

Enhanced oxidative stress to the parasite represents a most promising rationale for antimalarial chemotherapy because a number of lines of evidence suggest that this can effectively inhibit parasite growth (28Becker K.

Peroxidase, a widely distributed enzyme in both the plant and animal kingdom, exerts a wide spectrum of biological functions and plays a very important antioxidant role in defense against oxidative insult of the cell by scavenging the intracellular H2O2 (29Dunford H.B.

We have recently purified and characterized a new heme containing peroxidase (PfHpo) from P. falciparum (34Trivedi V. Srivastava K. Puri S.K. Maulik P.R. Bandyopadhyay U. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but its role in the antioxidant defense of the parasite is not yet known. Initial biochemical characterization shows that H2O2 interacts with this hemoperoxidase to form a catalytically active intermediate similar to compound II of peroxidases, where iron remains as a higher oxidation ferryl state (Fe(IV) = 0), and this active intermediate can oxidize aromatic substrate (34Trivedi V. Srivastava K. Puri S.K. Maulik P.R. Bandyopadhyay U. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we present direct evidence to show that CLT effectively inhibits PfHpo. The mechanism of inhibition has been studied in detail with the purified PfHpo, and the results indicate that CLT inhibits PfHpo by acting as a suicidal substrate. Furthermore, we have shown that the inhibition of PfHpo by CLT is associated with the increased accumulation of H2O2 and oxidative stress in P. falciparum. Moreover, the inhibition of PfHpo correlates well with the inhibition of P. falciparum growth at different concentrations of CLT. The studies, thus, provide new insights on the mechanism of antimalarial activity of clotrimazole. Materials—Saponin, SDS, d-sorbitol, RPMI 1640, clotrimazole, 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), diethylenediaminetriaminopentaacetic acid, dichlorofluorescein diacetate, glutathione (GSH), 5-5′-dithionitrobenzoic acid, thiobarbituric acid, and tetraethoxypropane were purchased from Sigma. Human blood group A+ was drawn from healthy volunteers. H2O2 was purchased from BDH. All other chemicals were of analytical grade purity. In Vitro Culture of P. falciparum—P. falciparum NF-54 strain was cultured in vitro according to the method of Trager and Jensen (35Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6039) Google Scholar). P. falciparum was grown in A+ human erythrocytes of 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 27 mm Na2CO3, pH 7.2-7.4, containing 10% v/v A+ human serum. Purification and Characterization of PfHpo—PfHpo was purified from P. falciparum as described previously (34Trivedi V. Srivastava K. Puri S.K. Maulik P.R. Bandyopadhyay U. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In brief, parasite was isolated from infected red cells, and the isolated parasite was lysed in phosphate-buffered saline by mild sonication (5-s pulse, bath type sonicator) at 4 °C, and the whole lysate was then subcellular-fractionated by differential centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, 15,000 × g for 15 min, and 105,000 × g for 1 h to get nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal pellet, respectively, and soluble cytoplasmic supernatant. The cytoplasmic supernatant, having peroxidase activity, was subjected to 65% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The supernatant obtained after 65% precipitation was further subjected to 80% ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the enzyme present in the 80% ammonium sulfate cut pellet was finally purified to homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography using Superdex-200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column. The purified peroxidase shows a native Mr of ∼30 kDa, as calculated from gel filtration by fast protein liquid chromatography using standard molecular weight markers, and it is a dimer of 2 ∼15-kDa subunits as evident from SDS-PAGE. The purified peroxidase (R/Z = 2.33, ϵ408 = 90 cm-1 mm-1) oxidizes guaiacol in presence of H2O2, and the kcat value is 1.3/s.

To measure the peroxidase activity, iodide oxidation was monitored by following the formation of I3- at 353 nm as described previously (31Bandyopadhyay U. Bhattacharyya D.K. Chatterjee R. Banerjee R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Bandyopadhyay U. Bhattacharyya D. Chatterjee R. Banerjee R.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The rate of inhibition of PfHpo by CLT was measured by incubation of PfHpo (0.5 μm) in the presence of H2O2 (100 μm) and CLT (0.5-5 μm) in a final volume of 30 μl containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2. At various time intervals after the addition of the inhibitor and H2O2, the incubation mixture was transferred to a cuvette containing 1 ml of assay mixture containing 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, 1.7 mm KI, and 0.27 mm H2O2. During the course of the study of substrate protection against inhibition, electron donor was added to the incubation mixture containing the enzyme before the addition of CLT and H2O2. EPR Studies—EPR spectra were recorded using DMPO as a spin trap in an X-band EPR spectrometer, Varian E-109, equipped with an E-238 cavity operating in TM 110 mode and using a flat quartz liquid sample cell. PfHpo (10 μm) was incubated with 1 mm H2O2, 1 mm CLT, 1 mm diethylenediaminetriaminopentaacetic acid, and 90 mm DMPO in a total volume of 1 ml containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2. Instrument conditions were: microwave power, 50 milliwatts; microwave frequency, 9.26 GHz; time constant, 0.016 s; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; gain, 2 × 104. Binding of CLT to PfHpo—Optical spectra were recorded in a total volume of 1 ml containing PfHpo in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 15 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 25 ± 1 °C with quartz cells of a 1-cm light path. Binding of CLT to native PfHpo or PfHpo·H2O2 complex was monitored at different concentrations (5-20 μm). A stable PfHpo·H2O2 complex was formed by adding a 10 m excess of H2O2 to the native enzyme, and to this complex different concentrations of CLT were added successively. Soret spectrum was recorded immediately after each addition of CLT. Heme Dissociation and ESI Mass Analysis—PfHpo (10 μm) was inactivated in the presence of CLT (40 μm) and H2O2 (100 μm) for a period of 10 min at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2. Heme was dissociated and extracted from the inactivated enzyme (0.5 ml) by adding an equal volume of cold acetone-HCl mixture (acetone containing 0.015 n HCl) as described (37Murphy M.J. Siegel L.M. Tove S.R. Kamin H. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Mass of the extracted heme was measured in a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The sample was dissolved in methanol and introduced into the ESI source through a syringe pump at the rate of 5 μl/min. The ESI capillary was set at 3.5 kV, and cone voltage was 40 V. Interaction of H2O2 with Native and CLT-modified PfHpo Measured by Optical Difference Spectroscopy—For modification of PfHpo with CLT, 100 μm H2O2 was added to a microcentrifuge tube containing a solution of excess CLT (1 mm), PfHpo (20 μm), and Tris-HCl buffer (100 mm, pH 7.2) in a total volume of 200 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Under these conditions the enzyme showed complete loss of activity. The reaction mixture was passed through the NAP-10 desalting column to remove small molecules. Spectral studies using control and modified enzyme were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 15 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 25 ± 1 °C in a 1-ml cuvette of 1-cm light path. The difference spectra of the CLT-modified PfHpo·H2O2 complex versus CLT-modified PfHpo or native PfHpo·H2O2 complex versus native PfHpo were recorded. Initially, both the sample and reference cuvettes were filled with 1 ml of enzyme solution, and a base-line trace was recorded. A small volume (usually 5-20 μl) of the H2O2 of appropriate concentration was then successively added to the sample cuvette with concomitant addition of the same volume of buffer to the reference cuvette. The contents of each cuvette were stirred well before the difference spectrum was recorded. Assay of PfHpo (Peroxidase) Activity in P. falciparum—P. falciparum (2% parasitemia) was cultured in the presence or absence of different concentrations of CLT for a period of 48 h. The culture was then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the parasite was isolated from control and treated groups -as described (38Hsiao L.L. Howard R.J. Aikawa M. Taraschi T.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Isolated parasite was lysed by mild sonication (5-s pulse, bath type sonicator) at 4 °C, and the peroxidase activity was measured from control or inhibitor-treated parasite lysate by following iodide oxidation as described previously (31Bandyopadhyay U. Bhattacharyya D.K. Chatterjee R. Banerjee R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Bandyopadhyay U. Bhattacharyya D. Chatterjee R. Banerjee R.K. Biochem.

Fluorometric Measurement of Intra-parasitic H2O2—P. falciparum (2% parasitemia) was cultured in the presence or absence of different concentrations of CLT for a period of 48 h. The culture was then further incubated for 30 min in RPMI complete media containing 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. The culture was then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the parasite was isolated from control and treated groups as described (38Hsiao L.L. Howard R.J. Aikawa M. Taraschi T.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Isolated parasites were lysed by mild sonication (5-s pulse, bath type sonicator) at 4 °C. H2O2 was measured in control or inhibitor-treated parasite by measuring the fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) formed due to the oxidation of non-fluorescent probe dichlorofluorescein diacetate by H2O2 as described (39Munzel T. Afanas'ev I. Kleschyov A. Harrison D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Fluorescent intensities were recorded from the lysates in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda LS 50B spectrofluorometer in a 5-mm path length quartz cell in a total volume of 1 ml at wavelength 502 and 523 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. H2O2 was measured as relative fluorescence and expressed as fluorescence intensity/mg of parasite lysate. Measurement of Reduced Glutathione—P. falciparum (2% parasitemia) was cultured in the presence or absence of different concentrations of CLT. After 48 h of treatment, the culture was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the parasite was isolated from the infected erythrocytes as described (38Hsiao L.L. Howard R.J. Aikawa M. Taraschi T.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). GSH content (as acid-soluble sulfhydryl) from control and inhibitor-treated parasite was determined as described (40Bandyopadhyay U. Biswas K. Chatterjee R. Bandyopadhyay D. Chattopadhyay I.

Isolated parasite was sonicated in 100 μl of 20 mm ice-cold EDTA in a bath type sonicator (5-s pulse for 30 s) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to get clear lysate. 50 μl of lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was added to an equal volume of 0.8 m Tris-Cl, pH 9, containing 20 mm 5-5′-dithionitrobenzoic acid to yield the yellow chromophore of thionitrobenzoic acid. which was measured at 412 nm. GSH content was measured as nmol/mg of parasite lysate. Measurement of Lipid Peroxidation as an Index of Oxidative Stress—P. falciparum was cultured in the presence or absence of CLT at different concentrations as described above. Parasite was isolated from infected erythrocytes, and lipid peroxidation products of the parasite lysate were determined as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (40Bandyopadhyay U. Biswas K.

Control or inhibitor-treated parasite (100 μl) was sonicated in ice-cold 0.9% saline in a bath-type sonicator. An aliquot (50 μl) of the parasite lysate was allowed to react with 100 μl of trichloroacetic acid-thiobarbituric acid-HCl reagent containing 0.01% butylated hydroxy-toluene, heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min, cooled, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances determination at 535 nm using tetraethoxypropane as standard and expressed as nmol of lipid peroxide/mg of parasite lysate. Inhibition of Parasite Growth in Culture—P. falciparum culture was synchronized by d-sorbitol treatment to obtain rings (43Lambros C. Venderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar), and all assays were started with ring-synchronized cultures of 2-4% parasitemia and processed as described previously (12Tiffert T. Ginsburg H. Krugliak M. Elford C. Lew V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Aliquots of stock solutions of CLT in Me2SO were dispensed in cell culture plates under sterile conditions to make final concentrations of 0.1-2 μm after the addition of parasitized red cell suspension in culture medium. The plates were placed in gas-tight desiccators that were flushed with a low oxygen gas mixture, sealed, and incubated at 37 °C for 0-48 h. Parasitemia and differential counts of asexual stages were carried out by counting parasites per 5000 erythrocytes after Giemsa staining. Inhibition of PfHpo by CLT—Preincubation of PfHpo with increasing concentrations of CLT in the presence of fixed H2O2 concentration results in concentration- and time-dependent irreversible inactivation of the enzyme after pseudo-first order kinetics (Fig. 1A), consistent with a mechanism-based (suicide) mode. When Kobs obtained from the slope of each line was plotted against CLT concentration, a straight line (Fig. 1B) was obtained from which a second-order rate constant was calculated to be 10 × 104 m-1·min-1 at 25 °C. The half-life of the enzyme inactivation (t½) at each CLT concentration, when plotted against the reciprocal of CLT concentration, yields a straight line (Fig. 1C). From this plot the affinity and kinetic constants were calculated, and the values of ki, kinact, and t½ were found to be 2.85 μm, 0.9 min-1, and 0.77 min, respectively. No significant inactivation occurs in the absence of H2O2 or CLT, suggesting the involvement of PfHpo-catalyzed CLT (CLTox) in the inactivation process. The results indicate that only H2O2 or CLT fails to inhibit PfHpo significantly, whereas the activity is almost completely inhibited when PfHpo is incubated in the presence of both CLT and H2O2 (TABLE ONE). Moreover, no catalytic activity could be recovered by either dilution of the reaction mixture or removing CLT and H2O2 by NAP 10 desalting column chromatography (TABLE ONE), indicating irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. Thus, CLT acts as a suicidal substrate and inactivates PfHpo after mechanism-based kinetics.TABLE ONESuicidal inhibition of PfHpo by CLT PfHpo (0.5 μm) was incubated in the presence or absence of CLT (2 μm) or H2O2 (100 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 30 μl containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2. The reaction mixture containing the CLT-inactivated enzyme was passed through NAP-10 desalting column, and the flow-through was collected for activity assay. Peroxidase activity was measured by following iodide oxidation as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Peroxidase activitynmol of I3–/minPfHpo22.40PfHpo + H2O220.56PfHpo + CLT20.76PfHpo + CLT + H2O20.55PfHpo + CLT + H2O2 (desalting column passed)0.45 Open table in a new tab Evidence for One-electron Oxidation of CLT—Peroxidase plays a very important role in host defense against oxidative damage by scavenging the intracellular H2O2 through the oxidation of a large variety of substrates including aromatic donors and inorganic anions (29Dunford H.B.

Because CLT acts as a suicidal substrate to PfHpo, it must be oxidized by the catalytically active PfHpo before inactivation. EPR spectroscopy using spin trap DMPO indicates that PfHpo oxidizes CLT by one-electron oxidation, and the formation of the CLT free radical has been identified as DMPO-CLT radical adduct (aN = 15 G) in the PfHpo·H2O2 system (Fig. 2a). This radical is not formed in the absence of H2O2 (Fig. 2b) or CLT (Fig. 2c). Protection of PfHpo against CLT Inactivation by Electron Donors— The kinetic data presented so far indicate that PfHpo is inactivated irreversibly by CLT, which acts as a suicidal substrate for oxidized PfHpo. However, inactivation could be prevented if the enzyme was preincubated with CLT in the presence of another electron donor (substrate) such as iodide, bromide, chloride, and guaiacol. TABLE TWO shows the effect of electron donors on PfHpo inactivation. All the electron donors quite effectively protect the enzyme from inactivation, but iodide or chloride protects in a better degree when compared with bromide or the aromatic donor guaiacol at the same concentration (100 μm). CLT alone could inhibit 98% activity, but in the presence of 100 μm iodide or chloride, it could inhibit only 5-6%.TABLE TWOProtection of PfHpo against CLT inactivation by electron donors PfHpo (0.5 μm) was incubated in the presence or absence of electron donors (100 μm) in a total volume of 30 μl containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, CLT (2 μm), and H2O2 (100 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2007172280,"Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and by subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which are therefore thought to be subject to similar regulatory mechanisms. Here, we show that the transcriptional machinery to express KIR is limited to NK and T cells; however, the KIR transcriptional control differs between these two types of lymphocytes. T cells selectively express transcriptional activators binding to positions -52 to -61 of the KIR promoter, whereas an AML site around position-98 is relevant for transcription in NK cells. Although KIR expression is restricted to subsets of memory T cells, our studies demonstrate that transcriptional activators for KIRs are not acquired during T cell differentiation but are already present in naive T cells, suggesting a basic role of KIRs in T cell biology. We suggest that the regulated expression of KIRs in T cells profoundly influences peripheral tolerance and antigen-specific immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2056965070,"Rubisco activase is an AAA+ protein, a superfamily with members that use a “Sensor 2” domain for substrate recognition. To determine whether the analogous domain of activase is involved in recognition of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, EC 4.1.1.39), two chimeric activases were constructed, interchanging a Sensor 2-containing region between activases from spinach and tobacco. Spinach chimeric activase was a poor activator of both spinach and tobacco Rubisco. In contrast, tobacco chimeric activase activated spinach Rubisco far better than tobacco Rubisco, similar to spinach activase. A point mutation, K311D, in the Sensor 2 domain of the tobacco chimeric activase abolished its ability to better activate spinach Rubisco.

Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The activation process requires ATP hydrolysis (7Robinson S.P. Portis Jr., A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but this activity, as measured in vitro, appears to be related to self-association, which occurs even in the absence of Rubisco (8Wang Z.Y. Ramage R.T. Portis Jr., A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The activase is subjected to redox regulation in Arabidopsis and probably other plant genera (9Zhang N. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9438-9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Zhang N. Kallis R.P. Ewy R.G. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism of action includes a binding step between activase and Rubisco, which is consistent with the kinetics of the activation process (11Robinson S.P. Streusand V.J. Chatfield J.M. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Salvucci M.E. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although chemical cross-linking (13Yokota A. Tsujimoto N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and co-immunoprecipitation of Rubisco and activase have been reported (14Dejimenez E.S. Medrano L. Martinezbarajas E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2826-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Zhang Z.L. Komatsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), most of the details of the binding process are still largely unknown. However, some insight into the process has been obtained by exploiting the peculiar specificity of Rubisco activase from plants in the family Solanaceae. Activase from plants in this family, which includes tobacco, tomato, potato, and petunia, was shown to be a poor activator of Rubisco from a wide range of plants outside the Solanaceae family, including spinach, barley, Arabidopsis, and maize and vice versa. In contrast, activase and Rubisco from distant families of non-solanaceous higher plants and even the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were capable of interacting with each other (16Wang Z.Y. Snyder G.W. Esau B.D. Portis Jr., A.R. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Several approaches have been used to examine the species selectivity between Rubisco and activase. In one approach, residues of Chlamydomonas Rubisco were targeted for modification by site-directed mutagenesis based on a comparison of the amino acid sequences and crystal structures of tobacco and spinach Rubiscos. Two separate point mutations, P89R and D94K, of the Chlamydomonas Rubisco large subunit greatly improved its activation by tobacco activase, but severely impaired its activation by spinach activase (17Larson E.M.

These results indicated an involvement of the N terminus of the large subunit of Rubisco in the interaction with activase. In another approach, Rubisco activation was examined with chimeric activase proteins that were constructed by interchanging DNA fragments from regions of tobacco and spinach activase cDNA (19Esau B.D. Snyder G.W. Portis Jr., A.R. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 58: 175-181Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The results showed that the C-terminal domain of activase was a major determinant of Rubisco specificity, whereas the N-terminal domain had little or no involvement in selectivity. Recently, Rubisco activase was identified as a member of a superset of the AAA protein family (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) (20Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) called the AAA+ family (21Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), based on sequence and structural homologies. In certain members of this family of proteins, including the chaperone components of all ATP-dependent proteases (22Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8318-8320Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a specific C-terminal domain, the “Sensor 2” domain, has been shown to be involved in protein-substrate recognition (23McAlear M.A. Howell E.A. Espenshade K.K. Holm C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4390-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that a C-terminal region of activase, which contains the Sensor 2 domain, is responsible for differences in Rubisco substrate recognition between activases from solanaceous and non-solanaceous plant species. Two critical amino acid residues in this region were identified and their individual roles were characterized. Materials—RuBP was synthesized and purified as described previously (25Edmondson D.L. Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Wild type Rubiscos from spinach/tobacco were isolated as previously reported (16Wang Z.Y.

Planta. 2003; 216: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) activase were used as starting materials. Site-directed mutagenesis primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. 2Mention of a trademarked, proprietary product of a vendor does not constitute a guarantee or warranty of the product by the United States Department of Agriculture and does not imply its approval to the exclusion of other products or vendors that may also be suitable. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene, Inc. All other reagents were of the highest purity readily available. Chimeric Protein Construction—cDNA clones of spinach and tobacco activase were used as the starting material. A region (including the Sensor 2 domain) close to the C terminus and encompassing residues 267–334 was the targeted region for replacement. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create a PstI site at the 5′ end of this region in the tobacco cDNA and a XhoI site at the 3′ end of this region in the spinach cDNA. The small fragments obtained by digestion with PstI/XhoI were ligated into the corresponding large fragment to create cDNAs encoding tobacco chimeric activase 267–334 (TS) and spinach chimeric activase 267–334 (ST). The numbering of amino acids in all activases presented here is based on the mature spinach activase sequence. The ligation products were introduced into the expression vector (pET23d) in Escherichia coli strain DH5α. DNA sequencing was performed to verify the constructions. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create the desired enzyme digestion sites and mutations on activase, following protocols provided in the QuikChange kit. Four mutants were generated from the tobacco chimeric activase (TS) construct, TSH269A, TSN302S/S303G, TSN308K, and TSK311D. Another six mutants were created in the native cDNAs: K311D and K311A in spinach activase (SK311D and SK311A); D311K and D311A in tobacco activase (TD311K and TD311A); and L314V and D311K/L314V in tobacco activase (TL314V and TD311K/L314V). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—All verified constructions/mutations were introduced into BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen). The procedures for expression and purification were the same as previously reported (9Zhang N. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Salvucci M.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8143-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ATPase and Rubisco Activation Assays—ATP hydrolysis was measured by coupling ADP production to NADH oxidation using a diode array spectrophotometer as reported previously (2Wang Z.Y. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1348-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Activase Kcat was calculated assuming a mass of 42 kDa. Rubisco activation by activase was also assayed spectrophotometrically as previously reported (29Esau B.D. Snyder G.W. Portis Jr., A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The fraction of sites activated was calculated by dividing the observed carboxylation rates by the maximal carboxylation rate, which is based on the observation that activity ratios are directly correlated with the extent of carbamoylation (30Butz N.D. Sharkey T.D. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 735-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carbamoylation rates of Chlamydomonas Rubiscos were calculated from the fraction of sites active in carboxylation, assuming that 1 mg of Rubisco contains 14.3 nmol of active sites (17Larson E.M.

Cotton Activase—Procedures for the purification and assay of cotton Rubisco and the β-form of recombinant cotton activase have been described in detail previously (28Salvucci M.E. van de Loo F.J.

Point mutations were introduced into the cotton activase cDNA using the Gene Tailor kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Chimeric Proteins—The location of eleven well established domains within the AAA+ module of activase is shown in Fig. 1. A DNA fragment encoding residues 267–334 of the mature spinach activase, spanning the Box VII″ and Sensor 2 domains, was interchanged between tobacco and spinach activase by recombinant DNA technology and targeted for mutagenesis. Alignment of the amino acid sequences that comprise this region showed that most of the differences among species exist in the C-terminal section that includes the Sensor 2 domain. Several residues that are quite divergent between the Solanaceae and non-solanaceous species and that were later selected for mutagenesis are highlighted. Both the tobacco chimeric activase containing spinach residues 267–334 (TS) and the spinach chimeric activase containing tobacco residues 267–334 (ST) were expressed in an active form. The ATPase activity of the TS was comparable with wild type tobacco activase, whereas the activity of ST was consistently lower in several separate preparations (Table I).Table IATPase activity and Rubisco activation specificity of tobacco activase, spinach activase, tobacco chimeric activase (TS), and spinach chimeric activase (ST) Rubisco activation, which was assayed with 5 μg/ml either tobacco or spinach Rubisco and 80 μg/ml Rubisco activase, was measured by the fraction of Rubisco sites activated after 5 min. The specific activities of fully activated spinach and tobacco Rubisco were 2.30 and 2.21 units/mg-1 protein, respectively.

Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that wild type spinach activase is a poor activator of tobacco Rubisco and vice versa (Table I). The activation activities of the chimeras TS and ST differed markedly from the wild type enzymes. The TS enzyme activated spinach Rubisco better than tobacco Rubisco, despite the fact that a majority of its sequence was derived from tobacco. This result indicates that the region from residues 267–334 was probably responsible for proper activase-Rubisco recognition between these two species. Unfortunately, the spinach chimeric protein ST was a very inefficient activator of both tobacco and spinach Rubisco. The low ATPase activity of this protein combined with its minimal activation activity with both Rubiscos suggests that the overall structure of the spinach activase was disrupted by the substituted tobacco residues. Mutations in Chimeric Activases—Because the only differences between the chimeric protein TS and wild type tobacco activase are 17 different amino acids in the replaced region, one or more residues in the Box VII″ and/or Sensor 2 domains must be responsible for the observed change in specificity. Five residues of the spinach insert, H269, N302/S303, N308, and K311, were selected for mutation back to the corresponding tobacco amino acid residue(s) to create the mutated chimeric proteins TSH269A, TSN302S/S303G, TSN308K, and TSK311D. With the possible exception of TSN308K, the ATPase activity of these proteins was comparable with the non-mutated chimera TS, indicating that these mutations did not cause drastic changes to the structure of activase (Table II).Tabel IIATPase activity and Rubisco activation specificity of tobacco chimeric activase (TS) with mutations H269A (TSH269A), N302S/S303G (TSN302S/S303G), N308K (TSN308K), and K311D (TSK311D) Assay conditions and Rubisco-specific activities were the same as in Table I.ActivaseATPase activityRubisco activationSpinach RubiscoTobacco Rubiscomin-1fraction of sites activatedTSH269A34 ± 10.56 ± 0.030.24 ± 0.01TSN302S/S303G34 ± 10.55 ± 0.040.17 ± 0.01TSN308K24 ± 10.47 ± 0.030.16 ± 0.01TSK311D37 ± 10.33 ± 0.040.34 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab The activation preferences of the mutated chimeras TSH269A, TSN302S/S303G, and TSN308K were similar to the non-mutated chimera, exhibiting greater activation activity toward spinach compared with tobacco Rubisco. In contrast, the TSK311D mutant chimera exhibited reduced activity toward spinach Rubisco and enhanced activity toward tobacco Rubisco. This result indicates that a lysine at position 311 is required for TS to better activate spinach Rubisco. Mutations in Wild Type Activases—To explore the role of residue 311 in activase specificity, this residue was mutated in tobacco and spinach activase. Both TD311A and TD311K had increased ATPase activity compared with wild type tobacco activase, whereas ATPase activity in the SK311A and SK311D mutants was less than the spinach wild type (Tables I and III).Tabel IIIATPase activity and Rubisco activation specificity of activase with mutations K311A (SK311A) and K311D (SK311D) in spinach activase and D311A (TD311A), D311K (TD311K), L314V (TL314V), and D311K/L314V (TD311K/L314V) in tobacco activase Assay conditions and Rubisco-specific activities were the same as in Table I.ActivaseATPase ActivityRubisco activationSpinach RubiscoTobacco Rubiscomin-1fraction of sites activatedTD311A61 ± 20.08 ± 0.010.31 ± 0.03TD311K66 ± 20.40 ± 0.030.48 ± 0.04TL314V26 ± 10.05 ± 0.040.53 ± 0.04TD311K/L314V24 ± 10.39 ± 0.020.20 ± 0.01SK311A21 ± 10.07 ± 0.010.04 ± 0.02SK311D30 ± 10.08 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Compared with wild type tobacco activase (Table I), the TD311K mutant exhibited reduced activity toward tobacco Rubisco and enhanced activity toward spinach Rubisco. The TD311A mutant did not activate spinach Rubisco, and its capacity to activate tobacco Rubisco was decreased by >50%. The analogous mutations in spinach activase, SK311D and SK311A, produced proteins that were unable to activate either spinach or tobacco Rubisco. Thus a Lys residue at 311 is required for both activases to interact with spinach Rubisco, whereas an Asp residue at 311 in tobacco activase allows for the better activation of tobacco Rubisco. Residue 314, which is in close proximity to 311, is a Leu in activase from the Solanaceae and a Val in non-solanaceous species. Therefore, this residue was mutated in wild type tobacco activase and the TD311K mutant to produce the single mutant TL314V and the double mutant TD311K/L314V. Compared with the wild type (Table I), the ATPase activity of both mutants was reduced by ∼50% (Table III). In activation assays, the TL314V mutant exhibited the same preference for tobacco over spinach Rubisco as the wild type tobacco activase (Table III). However the double mutant TD311K/L314V maintained the ability to activate spinach Rubisco (compared with TD311K) and reduced the ability to activate tobacco Rubisco. Thus, these two residues appear to work in combination to determine the species specificity of activase. Mutations in Cotton Activase—Because mutation of Lys-311 in spinach activase was deleterious for Rubisco activation, an activase from another non-solanaceous species was selected to perform the reciprocal experiments with residues 311 and 314 that were conducted with tobacco activase. Lys-311 and Val-314 as well as the intervening residue Lys-312 were mutated in cotton, and the mutant proteins were analyzed. Cotton activase was an inefficient activator of tobacco Rubisco and vice versa (Table IV). The K311D and, to a lesser extent, the V314L mutations decreased the ability of cotton activase to activate cotton Rubisco but enhanced the ability of the enzyme to activate tobacco Rubisco (Table IV). An even greater effect on altering specificity toward tobacco was observed with the double mutant CK311D/V314L. Measurement of ATPase activity showed that the reduced activity toward cotton Rubisco was not caused by a general disruption in activase structure, because the ATPase activity was higher in the mutants compared with wild type. Residue 312, which is an Arg in activase from some non-solanaceous plants (Fig. 1), was also mutated to examine the effect on Rubisco activation and ATPase activity. The cotton mutant CK312R exhibited reduced ATPase activity, but its selectivity for cotton Rubisco was unchanged from wild type.Tabel IVATPase and Rubisco activation specificity of cotton activase, cotton activase with mutations K311D (CK311D), V314L (CV314L), K311D/V314L (CK311D/V314L), K312R (CK312R), and tobacco activase Rubisco activation, which was assayed with 500 μg/ml either tobacco or spinach Rubisco and 500 μg/ml Rubisco activase, was measured by the fraction of Rubisco sites activated after 6 min. The specific activities of fully activated cotton and tobacco Rubisco were 1.68 and 1.31 units/mg-1 protein, respectively.

However, this preference can be changed by introducing specific mutations into the large subunit of Chlamydomonas Rubisco. The mutant Rubisco proteins, either P89R or D94K, were more efficiently activated by tobacco compared with spinach activase (17Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Ott C.M. Smith B.D. Portis Jr., A.R. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26241-26244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether these mutations in the large subunit of Rubisco could be complemented by mutations in tobacco activase that change its specificity (Table III), activation of the Chlamydomonas Rubisco mutants was examined in assays containing various concentrations of tobacco mutant activase (Fig. 2). As was observed previously (17Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the rates of Rubisco carbamoylation were directly proportional to the concentration of activase in the assay. The mutant tobacco activase TD311K was a much more efficient activator of wild type Chlamydomonas Rubisco compared with wild type tobacco activase. This preference was lost with the D94K mutant of Rubisco but was retained with the P89R mutant. In contrast, the tobacco activase mutant TL314V was a much more efficient activator of the D94K mutant of Rubisco compared with wild type tobacco activase but was a poor activator of the P89R mutant. Unlike wild type tobacco activase, the tobacco activase double mutant TD311K/L314V activated wild type Chlamydomonas Rubisco much better than it activated either of the Rubisco mutants. In this report, we demonstrated that the selectivity of Rubisco activase for Rubisco can be altered by interchanging amino acids in the region spanning the Box VII′ and Sensor 2 domains. Two of the amino acids in this region, 311 and 314, were shown to play a critical role in substrate (i.e. Rubisco) preference. Furthermore, mutation of each of these residues complemented a different one of the specificity-changing mutations in the Chlamydomonas Rubisco large subunit. These results indicate that there is a direct interaction between a domain in the N terminus of the large subunit of Rubisco and the Sensor 2 domain near the C terminus of activase and provide new and detailed information about the nature of this interaction. The data suggest that the interaction involves specific residue pairs, Rubisco-94 with activase-311 and Rubisco-89 with activase-314. Although both residues, 311 and 314, influenced the recognition of Rubisco by activase, residue 311 appeared to play the dominant role. Mutating Asp-311→Lys was sufficient to allow tobacco activase to activate spinach Rubisco, whereas changing Leu-314→Val caused almost no change in specificity. The reciprocal mutations in activase from the non-solanaceous species, cotton, had the corresponding effect; K311D improved activation of tobacco Rubisco and reduced activation of cotton Rubisco, whereas V314L had much less of an effect. Changing both residues was even more effective in switching the selectivity of non-solanaceous activase toward Solanaceae and away from non-solanaceous Rubisco and vice versa. Residues in proximity to 89 and 94 of the large subunit of Rubisco and ones near activase residues 311 and 314 are almost certain to participate in interactions between Rubisco and activase, but these residues probably do not determine specificity, because they are conserved. Without a three-dimensional structure for activase and particularly a structure for the binary complex between Rubisco and activase, it is difficult to identify all of the residues involved in their interaction. However, it is interesting that, within the region of the large subunit of Rubisco from 89 to 94, there is a negatively charged Glu-93 that is conserved in Rubisco and a potentially complementary and positively charged Lys or Arg at position 312 in activase. This pair represents a potential target of interest for future mutagenesis experiments. Changes in the position of the N terminus of Rubisco that occur as the molecule assumes the closed and open conformations (33Duff A.P. Andrews T.J. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) provide some insight into possible activase-Rubisco interactions (Fig. 3). During the transitions from the closed to the open conformation, the N terminus of Rubisco moves away from the catalytically active site, making the site accessible to solvent. The results presented here suggest that the interaction of activase with Rubisco may occur through electrostatic and other forces, involving the region 89–94 of Rubisco and the region 311–314 of activase and specifically the pairing of residues Rubisco-94 to activase-311, Rubisco-89 to activase-314 and possibly Rubisco-93 to activase-312. Once bound to Rubisco, ATP hydrolysis could promote movement of the C-terminal domain of activase, as occurs for other AAA+ ATPases (reviewed in Ref. 34Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), which may alter the position of the region from 89 to 94 and subsequently the entire N-terminal domain of the large subunit of Rubisco. It is likely that additional interactions between Rubisco and activase are required to complete the transition from closed to open conformation, because residues in both the extreme N and C termini of Rubisco activase have been shown to be involved in Rubisco activation (27van de Loo F.J. Salvucci M.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8143-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Esau B.D. Snyder G.W. Portis Jr., A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because these residues are conserved among all activases, they are probably not involved in determining the observed specificity in the interaction. Measurements of ATPase activity in the various activase mutants highlight the complex relationship between Rubisco activation and ATPase hydrolysis. Although ATP hydrolysis is absolutely required for Rubisco activation (7Robinson S.P. Portis Jr., A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the two activities are not strictly coupled, because ATP hydrolysis can proceed both in the absence of Rubisco and in directed and truncated mutants of activase that no longer activate Rubisco (27van de Loo F.J. Salvucci M.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8143-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Esau B.D. Snyder G.W. Portis Jr., A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Also, because the specific activities of ATPase and Rubisco activation change upon self-association of the enzyme (35Salvucci M.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Lilley R.M. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), mutations that affect activase aggregation would have an effect on activase activities that would be dependent on the concentration of activase protein. Thus, it is likely that mutations in activase that affect both ATPase hydrolysis and Rubisco activation (for example, the ST chimera) probably cause global changes in the overall structure of the protein, whereas the structural integrity of the enzyme is largely preserved in mutants, such as CK312R, that only affect one of these activities. The Sensor 2 domain is a key structural feature of the AAA+ module. Among many AAA+ proteins, there is a critical Arg residue in this domain (Fig. 1), which interacts with the bound nucleotide and is required for ATPase activity (reviewed in Ref. 37Ogura T. Whiteheart S.W. Wilkinson A.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The identification of activase-Rubisco interaction sites in the same region provides a direct way to couple ATP hydrolysis with the “opening” of Rubisco and is consistent with the proposed role(s) of this domain in other AAA+ proteins. The role of the conserved Arg is being investigated, and preliminary data suggest that it is required for ATP hydrolysis (unpublished data). 3C. Li, D. Wang, and A. R. Portis, Jr., unpublished data.

Once bound to the mRNA, HuR is recognized by adapter proteins that then facilitate nuclear export of the complex. In the cytosol, HuR is thought to function to control stability and translation of its ligand message. In the 3T3-L1 cells HuR is constitutively expressed and localized predominantly to the nucleus in the preadipocytes. However, within 30 min of exposure to the differentiation stimulus the HuR content in the cytosol increases, consistent with HuR regulating the availability of relevant mRNAs for translation. Using in vitro RNA gel shifts, we have demonstrated that the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) message is a ligand for HuR. Within 2 h of initiation of the differentiation process, HuR complexes containing C/EBPβ mRNA could be isolated from the cytosolic compartment. Importantly, the process appears to be highly selective, as cyclin D1, which contains a putative HuR binding site and is expressed on the same time frame as C/EBPβ, was not found in the immunoprecipitated messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes. The proximity of this event to adipogenic stimuli and the importance of C/EBPβ to the differentiation process have led us to hypothesize a role for HuR in the regulation of the onset of adipogenesis.

Transcription of the C/EBPβ gene is increased shortly after exposure of the cells to the differentiation inducers, and the C/EBPβ protein can be detected in the nucleus within 4 h (10Cole K.A. Harmon A.W. Harp J.B. Patel Y.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C349-C354Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On termination of the mitotic clonal expansion phase, C/EBPβ has been proposed to be responsible for the transactivation of C/EBPα and PPARγ genes, two transcription factors responsible for establishing and maintaining the adipocyte phenotype (11Rosen E.D.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13571-13575Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, C/EBPβ plays a critical early regulatory role in the differentiation process. HuR is an RNA-binding protein belonging to the Hu/ELAV family of mRNA-binding proteins and is expressed in adipose (this article), intestine, spleen, thymus, and testis with minor expression in liver and uterus (18Lu J.-Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). HuR contains a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence and functions as an adapter protein in the nuclear export of mRNAs that contain adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AREs) in their 3′-untranslated regions (19Ma W.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Depending on the specific message, the nuclear HuR-containing messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) is bound by APRIL and/or pp32 and then CRM1, which is recognized by a specific binding domain on the nuclear pore complex, facilitating nucleocytoplasmic transport. An alternative to the CRM1 route is mediated by transportin-2 binding to the HuR mRNA complex for exit through the nuclear pore (25Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 26Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Once in the cytosol, HuR functions to stabilize mRNA ligands (27Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 28Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Based on results obtained with the ectopic expression of the neuronal Hu family homolog HuB in both the 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human teratocarcinoma cells, HuR may also participate in control of translation initiation (29Jain R.G. Andrews L.G. McGowan K.M. Pekala P.H. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 30Antic D. Lu N. Keene J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The selection of ligands and the translocation of HuR to the cytosol has been proposed to be under tight control (31Li H. Park S. Kilburn B. Jelinek M.A. Henschen-Edman A. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Laird-Offringa I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44623-44630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Identification of the specific signal involved has remained elusive, with the exception of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages in which methylation of specific arginine residues in HuR by the nuclear coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase (CARM) appears to control the process (31Li H. Park S. Kilburn B. Jelinek M.A. Henschen-Edman A. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Laird-Offringa I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44623-44630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). HuR has been suggested to be involved in control of the cell cycle through stabilization of the mRNAs for cyclins A and B1 during S and G2, leading to increased expression of these proteins (32Wang W. Caldwell M.C. Lin S. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). HuR involvement in differentiation was supported by RNA interference knockdowns of the protein in C2C12 cells, which resulted in an inhibition of myogenesis coincident with decreased expression of MyoD and myogenin mRNAs, known ligands for HuR (33van der Giessen K. Di-Marco D. Clair E. Gallouzi I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47119-47128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, it might be argued that HuR, by selecting specific mRNA ligands and controlling their expression, is capable of controlling critical events in the cell cycle as well as the differentiation process. In the current study we demonstrate that the C/EBPβ message is a ligand for HuR and that the time frame for cytosolic translocation of the complex is consistent with an early regulatory event in the differentiation process. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Bovine calf serum and fetal calf serum were purchased from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, Utah). The 3T3-L1 cells used in this work were obtained from Howard Green (Harvard University, Boston, MA). The BCA protein assay kit, the NE-PER™ cell fractionation kit, and the HALT™ protease inhibitor mix were from Pierce. The RNAqueous RNA extraction kit was from Ambion (Austin, TX). Reagents for molecular biology were purchased from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The 3A2 monoclonal antibody directed against HuR and the β-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) The mouse anti-Armenian and anti-Syrian hamster IgG1 monoclonal antibody used as an isotype control was obtained from BD Biosciences. Antibodies directed against C/EBPβ were provided by M. Daniel Lane (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The antibody against HnRNP70 was provided by Jack Keene (Duke University, Durham, NC). The siGENOME SMARTpool™ reagent and the siCONTROL™ non-targeting siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO), Primers—The primers used for PCR were designed using the GCG program Prime. All sequences determined were subjected to a BLAST search to ensure selectivity of hybridization. These primers and their sequences were as follows: C/EBPβ, 5′-GCGGGGTTGTTGATGTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTTAATGCTCGAAACGG-3 (reverse); cyclin D1, 5′-GCTTGACCTTTCCCAACCC-3′ and 5′-TCACCTCTTCCCTCACA-TCC-3′ (reverse); and GATA3, 5′-AGTGTGCGAAGAGTTCCTCC-3′ (forward) and 5-TTTTTCACAGCACTAGAGACCC-3 (reverse). The T7 polymerase binding site was included in the double-stranded templates used in the preparation of riboprobes for RNA gel shift reactions by including the sequence 5′-GGAT CCTAATACGACTCACTATAGG-GAGCT-3′ at the 5′-end of a forward primer. 3T3-L1 Cell Culture—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured, maintained, and differentiated as described previously (29Jain R.G. Andrews L.G. McGowan K.M. Pekala P.H. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For experimentation, preadipocytes were harvested at 2 days post-confluence, and adipocytes were used at 8 days post-induction of differentiation. Differentiation was induced by exposure of the cells to isobutyl methyl xanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. These additions will be referred to as the “differentiation inducers” throughout the text. Isolation of Cytosolic and Nuclear Fractions—The NE-PER™ cell fractionation kit was used to isolate cytosolic and nuclear fractions from the 3T3-L1 cells as per the manufacturer's (Pierce) instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, 5–10-cm culture dishes were used as a source of material for the separation. In addition to the standard protease inhibitors, an RNase inhibitor was added to the lysate. Incubation time for the initial extract was increased from 10 to 15 min. Once the cytosolic fraction was isolated, the nuclear fraction was subjected to a brief centrifugation, and the interface was removed to reduce cytoplasmic contamination. The isolated fractions were stored at -80C° until use. Because of high salt concentrations, nuclear fractions were dialyzed prior to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of mRNP Complexes—The mRNP complexes from either nuclear or cytosolic fractions were immunoprecipitated and mRNA isolated using RNase- and DNase-free conditions by a modification of the protocol described by Tennenbaum et al. (34Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 35, Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose beads were resuspended overnight at 4 °C in 10 ml of HNTM buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100). For immunoprecipitation, 200 μg of cytosolic lysate or 100 μg of nuclear lysate was utilized. Four samples were prepared for each immunoprecipitation, three for the isolation of RNA and one as a Western blot analysis control. Starting with the protein extract in HNTM buffer, the following were added to an RNase/DNase-free microfuge tube: Halt protease inhibitor (10 μl), vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (10 μl), 40 units/μl RNase inhibitor (10 μl), 0.1 m dithiothreitol (1 μl), and 0.5 m EDTA (33 μl). The antibody was then added; for the isotype control, anti-Armenian/anti-Syrian hamster IgG1 monoclonal antibody was used, and, for HuR, monoclonal 3A2 was used. Finally, the appropriate volume of lysate was added and the mixture rotated for 3 h at room temperature followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads with continued mixing for an additional 2 h at room temperature. This was followed by two washes with HNTM buffer alone. The mixture was then centrifuged (13,200 rpm at 4 °C) and washed three times with cold 1 m urea in HNTM buffer. One of the samples was taken at this time for the Western analysis control, and RNA was extracted from the remainder using the Ambion RNAqueous kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was stored at -80 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as detailed previously (36Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13580-13584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the disparity in nuclear versus cytosolic HuR concentrations, 5 μg of nuclear protein and 25 μg of cytosolic protein were used for Western blot analysis. RNA Gel Shift Analysis—Radiolabeled probes were prepared from double-stranded constructs containing the T7 polymerase promoter using the Ambion RNA probe synthesis and removal kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. The probe was gel-purified and used for gel shift assays at ∼100,000 cpm of probe per assay. Approximately 2 μg of either cytosolic or nuclear protein was incubated with the probe in the presence of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 30–60 min. If supershifts were being carried out, the antibody (1 μl) was added at this time and the binding reaction was continued for an additional 30 min at room temperature. At the end of the binding reaction heparin was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the incubation was continued for a final 10 min at room temperature. An equal volume of 2× native gel sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.0025% bromphenol blue, pH 8.6) was added to the reaction mixture. The gels were pre-run for 30 min at 250 volts, and then the sample was loaded and complexes were formed separated on a native 4% acrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate-EDTA. Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film. siRNA Treatment of the 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—Transfection of the cells was performed using Dharmacon siGENOME SMARTpool™ reagent (catalog number M-053812-00-0020), a four-siRNA oligo system designed specifically for HuR (mouse ELAV1; GenBank™ accession number NM_010485) by Dharmacon. Briefly, preadipocytes in 12-well plates at ∼80% confluency were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 as a carrier according to manufacturer's instructions. Two control transfections were carried out, one with Lipofectamine 2000 alone and the other with Dharmacon siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA™ four-oligo pool (Sc) (catalog number D-001206-13-05). The cells were exposed to the transfection mixture for 6 h, at which time the transfection medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours after removal of the transfection media, two monolayers of each treatment group were trypsinized and combined to generate an immediately confluent monolayer, essential for differentiation. Eighteen hours later (48 h after the initial transfection), the cells were exposed to the differentiation protocol. Cells were then analyzed for acquisition of the adipocyte phenotype. HuR Is Constitutively Expressed in the 3T3-L1 Cells—The results displayed in Fig. 1A demonstrate the constitutive expression of HuR in 2-day post-preadipocytes and fully differentiated (day 8) adipocytes as well as the effectiveness of the Pierce NE-PER™ kit for cytosol versus nuclear separation. For this analysis, 5 μg of nuclear and 25 μg of cytosolic extract were separated, blotted, and probed with antibodies directed against HuR, HnRNP70, and β-tubulin. The later two were used as markers for nuclear and cytosolic compartments. It should be noted that the decrease in β-tubulin with differentiation (seen in Fig. 1A) has been reported previously (37Bernlohr D.A. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5563-5567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B, 10 μg of protein were utilized for the analysis of both compartments. The data demonstrate that HuR is expressed in the preadipocytes with expression increasing ∼3-fold as the cells differentiate. Notable is the increased presence of HuR in the cytosol with respect to differentiation. Analysis of three separate experiments indicates that in the preadipocytes ∼15 ± 5% of the total HuR resides in the cytosol, whereas in the fully differentiated adipocyte cytosolic HuR represents 40 ± 8% of total cellular HuR. We note that because we are comparing 2-day post-confluent (day 0) preadipocytes with fully differentiated adipocytes in Fig. 1B, no marker protein is utilized for normalization. The protein content of the markers changes significantly during the differentiation process. We then determined the time frame for HuR movement to the cytosol. Cytosolic fractions were prepared and assayed by Western blot analysis for the presence of the HuR protein with respect to the time after exposure of the preadipocytes to the differentiation inducers. As shown in Fig. 2, in the preadipocytes (2 days post-confluence, day 0/time 0) HuR is detectable in the cytosol. However, within 30 min after initiation of differentiation, the cytosolic content increased by 30%. Over the next 48 h the cytosolic content of HuR attained a maximum 45% increase over the preadipocyte content. (quantification of HuR movement was performed using a Kodak Gel Logic 100 imaging system and normalized to the β-tubulin levels.) The increase was maintained through day 8, when the cells were considered to be fully differentiated (data not shown). Thus, HuR exits the nucleus early and establishes a new equilibrium distribution between the nucleus and the cytosol and maintains that distribution in the terminally differentiated adipocyte. Note that the cytosolic marker β-tubulin, the concentration of which does not change during the time frame of the experiment, demonstrates even loading of the samples. The C/EBPβ mRNA Is a Ligand for HuR in Vitro—The rapid translocation of HuR to the cytosol after the addition of differentiation inducers to the culture suggested that it might be involved in a critical early event in the differentiation process. Focusing on the role of HuR in the movement of specific mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytosol, we began to look for potential mRNA ligands. Cole et al. (10Cole K.A. Harmon A.W. Harp J.B. Patel Y.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C349-C354Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the C/EBPβ protein can be found in the nucleus within 4 h of the addition of the differentiation inducers to the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This would suggest that the C/EBPβ message must exit the nucleus shortly after the addition of the differentiation inducers. If formation of a HuR complex with the C/EBPβ message is obligatory for translocation to the cytosol, both HuR and C/EBPβ mRNA should be observed moving to the cytosol rapidly after the addition of the inducers. Examination of the C/EBPβ sequence demonstrates the presence of an ARE in the 3′-UTR (Fig. 3A) that might serve as a potential binding site for HuR. Cytosolic extracts were prepared from fully differentiated adipocytes, and the RNA gel shift assays performed using a radiolabeled probe corresponding to the ARE are shown in Fig. 3A. As shown in Fig. 3B, lane 2, in the presence of added protein the probe was shifted to a higher molecular sized complex consistent with formation of a protein-RNA complex. Addition of an HuR antibody resulted in a supershift (Fig. 3B, lane 3), confirming the presence of HuR in the complex. No shift was observed when antibodies against either AUF1 or HuB were used in the supershift assay. In Fig. 3B, lane 4, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe was used to compete for HuR binding. Thus, in an in vitro assay HuR forms an mRNP complex with the ARE from the 3′-UTR of C/EBPβ. Rapid Formation of Nuclear HuR-C/EBPβ Complexes and Their Translocation to the Cytosol—To determine whether the C/EBPβ message was present in an mRNP complex with HuR, immunoprecipitations were performed on both nuclear and cytosolic extracts prepared at 0 and 30 min after the addition of the differentiation inducers. As shown in Fig. 4A, Western blot analysis indicates that the HuR protein was detected in the nuclear fractions at both time points. However, the decreased nuclear presence of the HuR protein 30 min after induction of differentiation is readily apparent. Analysis of the mRNA present in the immunoprecipitated mRNP complex shown in Fig. 4B, indicates that, prior to the addition of the differentiation inducers, HuR-C/EBPβ complexes could not be detected. However, within 30 min of addition of the inducers C/EBPβ mRNA was found to be present in the immunoprecipitated complex. Examination of the cytosol for the presence of these complexes over the same time period demonstrates the presence of HuR protein in the cytosol (Fig. 4C) with an increase detectable at 30 min after the induction of differentiation, consistent with translocation. In Fig. 4D the presence of the C/EBPβ mRNA in the immunoprecipitated complex at the 30-min time point is demonstrated. The data presented in Fig. 4 support a model in which treatment of the preadipocytes with the differentiation inducers results in formation of a HuR-C/EBPβ message complex in the nucleus. This is followed by translocation to the cytosol and represents a very early event in the differentiation program. Examination of the translocation at later time points (Fig. 5) indicates the presence of C/EBPβ mRNA in the complex at 2 h, with a stronger signal evident at the 48-h time point. By day 8 after induction, a HuR-C/EBPβ complex can no longer be detected, consistent with diminished expression of the transcription factor (data not shown).Fig. 5C/EBPβ-HuR complex formation at extended times. Nomenclature and designations are identical to those in Fig. 4 with the following additions: P, positive control (total day 4 adipocyte RNA); N, negative (water) control, Panel A, time course Western analysis at times 0, 2, and 48 h after exposure to the differentiation inducers. Panel B, reverse transcription PCR analysis for the presence of C/EBPβ. These data are representative of at least four separations performed with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the specificity of the selection of the C/EBPβ message by HuR, we examined for the presence of cyclin D1 mRNA in the immunoprecipitates. Cyclin D1 was selected because it has a strong ARE in the 3′-UTR and is expressed during the differentiation program on the same time frame as C/EBPβ (38Morrison R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition, we examined for the presence of GATA-3 mRNA, a message containing no ARE. Neither cyclin D1 nor GATA3 mRNA were detected (data not shown). The data demonstrate a highly regulated HuR selection of the C/EBPβ mRNA as a very early event in the differentiation process. Effect of HuR Depletion on Adipocyte Differentiation—Using Dharmacon SMARTpool™ four-oligo siRNA technology, we developed an approach to suppress HuR protein content in the 3T3-L1 cells. The study used two controls, our transfection agent, Lipofectamine 2000, alone, and a Dharmacon non-targeting four-oligo pool (Sc). As detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” cells at 80% confluency were transfected with 100 nm oligo for 6 h, at which time the media was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours later, two monolayers were combined to generate one confluent monolayer, which was absolutely essential for induction of differentiation. Eighteen hours later (48 h after the initial transfection), the cells were exposed to the differentiation inducers. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that HuR protein levels at the time of treatment with the differentiation inducers were decreased by 70 ± 12% (n = 4) relative to the controls. HuR content remained decreased for at least 5 days, at which time HuR protein began to increase gradually as the long term effectiveness of the treatment diminished by day 10. The observed phenotype is presented and characterized in Fig. 6. The data presented in Fig. 6, A and B display the results of monitoring the cells for the appearance of morphological differentiation. At 5 days post-induction of differentiation, both Lipofectamine 2000 and Sc controls were accumulating lipid droplets as demonstrated by phase-contrast microscopy of both unstained (Fig. 6A) and Oil Red O-stained cells (Fig. 6B). The decreased magnification of the Oil Red O-stained cells represents a larger field and demonstrates the uniformity of the lipid accumulation in the controls. However, the cells treated with HuR siRNAs retained the preadipocyte morphology at this time. In companion day 5 monolayers treated identically to those displayed in Fig. 6, A and B, Western blot analysis was performed for HuR and C/EBPβ (Fig. 6, C and D). The data displayed in Fig. 6C demonstrate a 65% suppression of HuR protein relative to both Lipofectamine 2000 and Sc controls. Similar results were observed with C/EBPβ (Fig. 6D), where the protein content of both the liver-activating protein (LAP) and liver-inhibitory protein (LIP) forms of the transcription factor are decreased markedly relative to controls. Examination of the expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPδ as well as PPARγ (Fig. 6E) demonstrates that these transcription factors were also suppressed in the HuR-depleted cells (for comparison, note that the β-tubulin present as a loading control in the Sc lane is decreased relative to the Lipofectamine 2000 lane by 40% in Fig. 6). These results provide a strong correlation between the levels of HuR and C/EBPβ expression displayed in Fig.6, C and D and the acquisition of the adipocyte morphology displayed in panels A and B of Fig. 6. Most importantly, these data are consistent with the cellular protein content of HuR controlling C/EBPβ expression and, thus, the acquisition of the adipocyte phenotype. Our results describe the constitutive expression of the RNA-binding protein HuR in the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with a modest 3-fold increase in protein content with respect to differentiation. At confluence in the preadipocyte, the majority of HuR protein is retained in the nucleus. However, upon exposure of the cells to the differentiation inducers there is a rapid formation of a nuclear HuR-C/EBPβ complex followed by a translocation of the complex to the cytosol. When HuR expression was reduced using siRNA, the cells retained their preadipocyte morphology, failed to express normal levels of C/EBPβ, and did not accumulate lipid droplets through a 5-day time course. These observations are consistent with maintenance of HuR protein content and the ability of the cells to express C/EBPβ and progress through the differentiation program. Importantly, work by others has demonstrated that the differentiation process can be blocked with the reagents leptomycin B (42Sprott K.M. Chumley M.J. Hanson J.M. Dobrowsky R.T. Biochem.

Commun. 2001; 286: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, although in both studies differentiation was blocked, the C/EBPβ protein was expressed at normal (42Sprott K.M. Chumley M.J. Hanson J.M. Dobrowsky R.T. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to above normal levels (43Habinowski S.A. Witters L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This suggests that suppression of HuR expression results in an inhibition of differentiation a step earlier than the accumulation of C/EBPβ protein. Our data are consistent with that step involving the HuR-mediated movement of the C/EBPβ message to the cytosol. The major pathway proposed to mediate the cytosolic translocation from the nucleus involves recognition of the exon-junction complex by adapter proteins that, in turn, are recognized by specific nucleoporins (20Fan X.C.

However, the C/EBPβ gene has no introns and must utilize an alternative export mechanism, which is likely mediated by HuR recognition of the 3′-ARE (39Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This selection of the C/EBPβ mRNA by HuR and mediation of its translocation to the cytosol becomes a potentially critical control step in the onset of adipogenesis. In addition, these data are consistent with other models where cytosolic translocation of Hu proteins and their associated mRNAs correlated with the onset of myogenesis or neural development (33van der Giessen K.

Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of neuronal HuB in the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes resulted in an early expression of C/EBPβ followed by a rapid onset of differentiation and increased deposits of triacylglycerol (29Jain R.G. Andrews L.G. McGowan K.M. Pekala P.H. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 40Gantt K.R. Jain R.G. Dudek R.W. Pekala P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These data suggested that an endogenous member of the Hu family may play a role in the temporal control of the differentiation process. The data presented herein would suggest that HuR serves that purpose. The choice of a ligand mRNA by HuR is a selective process. Neither cyclin D1, an ARE-containing mRNA expressed with the same kinetics as C/EBPβ (38Morrison R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), nor GATA3, a message without an ARE, was present in the mRNP complexes. Wang et al. (32Wang W. Caldwell M.C. Lin S. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) have reported that HuR present in extracts prepared from serum-stimulated RKO cells did not bind to the cyclin D1 ARE in gel shift assays. This was all the more interesting, as previous studies have demonstrated that recombinant HuR would bind to the cyclin D1 ARE in similar gel shift assays, indicating that the metabolic/hormonal state of the cell may control the selection of ligands by the HuR protein. We would suggest that the tight temporal control of specific mRNA selection and translocation to the cytosol during the differentiation process would be an absolute necessity and that these data support the existence of a new control point in the differentiation process. Upon differentiation, a new distribution of HuR protein is established with as much as 40% of the total remaining in the cytosol, long after the expression of C/EBPβ has diminished. Our previous work has established that, in the fully differentiated adipocytes, the GLUT1 glucose transporter mRNA is a ligand for HuR and that other ligand mRNAs are selected with respect to the time course of differentiation (41, Gantt, K., Atasoy, U., Harrison, R., Cheatham, B., and Pekala, P.

We report here that the extracellular, membrane-proximal α/β stalk interactions not only regulate cation-induced integrin activation but also play critical roles in propagating inside-out signaling. Two closely related integrins, αIIbβ3 and αVβ3, share high structural homology and bind to similar ligands in an RGD-dependent manner.

Although αVβ3 showed robust ligand binding in the presence of Mn2+, αIIbβ3 showed a limited increase but failed to achieve full activation. Swapping α stalk regions between αIIb and αV revealed that the α stalk, but not the ligand-binding head region, was responsible for the difference. A series of αIIb/αV domain-swapping chimeras were constructed to identify the responsible domain. Surprisingly, the minimum component required to render αIIbβ3 susceptible to Mn2+ activation was the αV calf-2 domain, which does not contain any divalent cation-binding sites. The calf-2 domain makes interface with β epidermal growth factor 4 and β tail domain in three-dimensional structure. The effect of calf-2 domain swapping was partially reproduced by mutating the specific amino acid residues in the calf-2/epidermal growth factor 4-β tail domain interface. When this interface was constrained by an artificially introduced disulfide bridge, the Mn2+-induced αVβ3-fibrinogen interaction was significantly impaired. Notably, a similar disulfide bridge completely abrogated fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 when αIIbβ3 was activated by cytoplasmic tail truncation to mimic inside-out signaling. Thus, disruption/formation of the membrane-proximal α/β stalk interface may act as an on/off switch that triggers integrin-mediated bidirectional signaling.

Thus, disruption/formation of the membrane-proximal α/β stalk interface may act as an on/off switch that triggers integrin-mediated bidirectional signaling. Integrins are a family of α/β heterodimeric transmembrane cell surface receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions. The hallmark of integrin-dependent adhesive interaction is its regulation by intracellular signaling events (inside-out signaling) and by divalent cations. In addition to mediating adhesive interactions, liganded integrins initiate signals inside the cell to modify cell behavior (outside-in signaling) and thus play fundamental roles in numerous biological processes such as differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, and cell motility (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7005) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated bidirectional signaling is accompanied by conformational change of the integrin structure. The crystal structure of αVβ3 extracellular domains revealed an unexpected bent conformer distinct from the extended conformer observed under electron microscope (2Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). High-resolution electron microscopic observation on truncated recombinant αVβ3 has confirmed the presence of both conformers, suggesting that the transition from one conformer to another might take place under physiological conditions (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). However, integrin extension per se is not required for the activation, but the swing-out of the β hybrid domain (the transition from “closed” headpiece to “open” headpiece) that accompanies the extension is the critical event (5Luo B.H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, integrin extracellular domains undergo extensive structural rearrangement (so-called “switchblade-like” movement) upon Mn2+/ligand binding. In support, fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements between α4β1-bound peptide ligand and plasma membrane revealed that such movement actually takes place in living cells (6Chigaev A. Zwartz G.J. Buranda T. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32435-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Chigaev A. Buranda T. Dwyer D.C. Prossnitz E.R. Sklar L.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3951-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Divalent cations differentially regulate integrin-ligand interaction. Whereas Mn2+ and, to a lesser extent, Mg2+ have an enhancing effect, Ca2+ typically has an inhibitory effect on ligand binding. Biochemical studies have suggested the existence of three classes of cation-binding sites with distinct function and preference for cations (8Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The αVβ3 extracellular domains turned out to contain eight cation-binding sites. Five of them are located in the β-propeller and at the junction between the thigh and calf-1 domains of the α subunit. The other three are located in the βA domain of the β subunit. Besides the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), which is essential for ligand binding (9Loftus J.C. O'Toole T.E. Plow E.F. Glass A. Frelinger III, A.L. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 10Kamata T. Tieu K.K. Tarui T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Hogg N. Takada Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2296-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the βA domain possesses two additional sites designated ADMIDAS (adjacent to MIDAS) and LIMBS (ligand-associated metal binding site), respectively (11Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Whereas ADMIDAS is occupied by a cation regardless of the presence of bound ligand, MIDAS and LIMBS have been shown to bind Mn2+ only in the presence of bound ligand (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 11Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). A recent report by Chen et al. (12Chen J. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggests that the ADMIDAS is the negative regulatory site for Ca2+, whereas LIMBS is the positive regulatory site for Ca2+. These reports implicate that the cation-binding sites in the βA domain represent the three classes of cation-binding sites described by Mould et al. (8Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), thus they are primarily responsible for integrin affinity regulation by divalent cations. In contrast, the role of the α subunit, particularly the five cation-binding sites, has not been clearly defined. Two β3 integrins, αIIbβ3 and αVβ3,share high structural homology (13Fitzgerald L.A. Poncz M. Steiner B. Rall Jr., S.C. Bennett J.S. Phillips D.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8158-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both integrins share a common β3 subunit and bind fibrinogen (Fbg), 1The abbreviations used are: Fbg, fibrinogen; EGF, epidermal growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DTT, dithiothreitol; TM, transmembrane; βTD, β tail domain; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and vitronectin in an RGD-dependent manner. Despite these structural and functional similarities, divalent cations regulate ligand binding differently in these integrins. Kinetic studies have shown that Mn2+ supports Fbg binding to both αIIbβ3 and αVβ3, albeit with a relatively slow association rate, whereas Ca2+ supports Fbg binding only to αIIbβ3, but not to αVβ3 (14Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement, real-time measurements of Fbg binding interaction have shown that Mn2+ increased the affinity for Fbg in both integrins by increasing the association rate (4Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 15Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, αVβ3-mediated cell attachment to immobilized Fbg was greatly enhanced by Mn2+ but not by Ca2+ (14Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, intact αIIbβ3 expressed on the cell surface exhibits different characteristics. First of all, cations including Mn2+ are unable to initiate platelet aggregation or induce Fbg binding to platelets, unless platelets are stimulated by agonists. The agonist-stimulated platelet aggregation is also poorly supported by Mn2+ (14Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1989; 62: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence suggest that cation-binding sites in the βA domain do not account for the distinct response to Mn2+ in β3 integrins, but rather that the structural difference in the α subunit may be responsible. In this study, we sought to determine the mechanism that regulates Mn2+-induced activation in β3 integrins. We provide evidence that the calf-2 domain, but not the cation-binding sites, in the α subunit plays a critical role in regulating the Mn2+-induced integrin activation. Furthermore, the results suggest that disruption/formation of the membrane-proximal calf-2/epidermal growth factor (EGF)4-β tail domain (βTD) interface may act as an on/off switch that propagates the conformational signals in integrin-mediated bidirectional signaling.

The αIIbβ3 complex-specific anti-αIIb mAb P2, anti-β3 mAb SZ21, and anti-αV mAb AMF-7 were purchased from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA). Anti-αIIbβ3 complex-specific activating mAb PT25-2 and non-functional anti-β3 mAb VNR5-2 have been characterized previously (21Tokuhira M. Handa M. Kamata T. Oda A. Katayama M. Tomiyama Y. Murata M.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and R-phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies were purchased from BIOSOURCE. Synthetic peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) was purchased from Peptide Research Institute (Osaka, Japan). FITC was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Human Fbg was purchased from Experimental Cell Research (South Bend, IN). Construction of Mutant αIIb, αV, and β3 cDNA Clones—The full-length cDNAs for integrin αIIb, αV, and β3 subunits (generous gifts from Dr. Joseph C. Loftus, Mayor Clinic, AZ) were cloned into mammalian expression vector pBJ-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Mark Davis, University of California, San Francisco, CA). A SacI site was engineered into the αV cDNA at site homologous to the endogenous SacI site in the αIIb cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis using Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (BD Biosciences). The cDNAs for B/V and V/B chimeras were created by replacing the SacI-BamHI fragment between αIIb and αV. The cDNAs for αIIb/αV domain-swapping chimeras TC1C2, TC1, T, C1, C2, D, C1C2D, TC2D, and TC1D were created using the overlap extension PCR method. The domain boundaries for each chimera were set as shown in Fig. 1A. The cDNAs for B/V 753–755, B/V 760–764, B/V 774, B/V 781–783, B/V 787, B/V 899–900, B/V 902–904, and B/V 958–960 mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis. In these αIIb mutants, the amino acid sequences in each of the indicated regions were replaced by the corresponding αV sequences (753NSF to VSS, 760VVAAE to FLPIP, Asp774 to Glu, 781EHT to QHI, His787 to Arg, 899QR to KS, 902MTV to ILY, and 958ALE to GIQ, respectively). Likewise, B/V 760, B/V 761, B/V 762, B/V 763, B/V 764, B/V 899, and B/V 900 mutants represent V760F, V761L, A762P, A763I, E764P, Q899K, and R900S mutations, respectively. The cDNAs for B/V 787/899–900 and B/V 787/900 were created from cDNAs for B/V 787 and B/V 899–900 and for B/V 787 and B/V 900, respectively, by replacing the BamHI fragment. The cDNA for B/V 760–764/787/899–900 was created from cDNAs for B/V 760–764 and B/V 787/899–900 by replacing the SacI fragment. The αV D599A, αV E636A, αV S749C, αIIb F755C, β3 D606C, β3 L717tr (β3tr), and αIIb G991tr (αIIbtr) mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis. The β3 D606C/L717tr double mutant (606tr) was created from β3 D606C and β3 L717tr by replacing the ApaI fragment. The αIIb F755C/G991tr double mutant (755tr) was created from αIIb F755C and αIIb G991tr by replacing the BamHI fragment. The authenticity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (BIOSOURCE), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 1% non-essential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator supplemented with 5% CO2. Fifty μg of αV or αIIb cDNA construct was co-transfected with 50 μg of β3 cDNA construct into CHO-K1 cells by electroporation. After 48 h, the cells were detached and used for assays. Flow Cytometry—Cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3.5 mm EDTA. After washing, cells were incubated with mAbs in modified HEPES-Tyrode buffer (5 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1× Tyrode's solution) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 4 °C. For some experiments, 1 mm GRGDS peptide was included together with mAbs. After washing, cells were incubated with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, and fluorescence was measured on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). To compare the binding of conformation-dependent mAbs among cells expressing different αVβ3 mutants, each mAb binding was normalized by the expression of αVβ3. This relative mAb binding was calculated by dividing the mean fluorescent intensity obtained with each anti-LIBS mAb by the mean fluorescent intensity with non-conformation-dependent anti-β3 mAb SZ21. Fibrinogen Binding Assay—FITC labeling of human Fbg was performed as previously described (22Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18610-18615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, after adjusting the pH of human Fbg at 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline to 8.5 with 5% Na2CO3, 0.01 volume of 10 mg/ml FITC in Me2SO was added and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. FITC-labeled Fbg was separated from free FITC on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with HEPES-buffered saline. The concentration and fluorescence/protein ratio of FITC-labeled Fbg was calculated as previously described. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were detached and incubated with non-functional anti-β3 mAb VNR5-2 followed by a R-phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG. In some experiments, cells were treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) prior to incubation with mAbs as described previously (21Tokuhira M. Handa M. Kamata T. Oda A. Katayama M. Tomiyama Y. Murata M. Kawai Y. Watanabe K. Ikeda Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 1038-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After washing, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled Fbg (200 μg/ml) with or without 1 mm GRGDS peptide in modified HEPES-Tyrode buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2 for 1 h at 4 °C. In some experiments, mAb PT25-2 was included at 10 μg/ml to activate αIIbβ3. After washing, fluorescence was measured on FACSCalibur. The mean Fbg binding (mean fluorescence intensity in FL1 channel) to cell populations expressing high β3 (fluorescence intensity in FL2 channel > 500) was calculated. Background binding in the presence of 1 mm GRGDS peptide was subtracted to obtain specific binding. Swapping α Stalk Region Switches the Enhancing Effect of Mn2+ on Ligand Binding—To locate the structure in the α subunit responsible for the difference in Mn2+ activation, we first swapped the C-terminal stalk region consisting of the thigh, calf-1, calf-2, transmembrane (TM), and cytoplasmic domains between αIIb and αV. The B/V chimera has αIIb β-propeller joined with αV stalk, whereas the V/B chimera has αV-propeller joined with αIIb stalk. In terms of cation-binding site, only the site at the junction between the thigh and the calf-1 domains is replaced in those chimeras, and the other four sites in the β-propeller domain remain unchanged (Fig. 1A). The chimeras were transiently expressed in CHO cells. Surface expression of each chimeric molecule was monitored using mAbs PL98DF6, P2, SZ21, PT25-2, OP-G2, and AMF-7. All chimeras showed mAb binding comparable with that of wild-type αIIbβ3 or αVβ3 (data not shown). In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+ without any activators, none of the cells expressing chimeras including wild-type αIIbβ3 or αVβ3 significantly bound Fbg (Fig. 1B). In the presence of mAb PT25-2, which binds to αIIb β-propeller and activates αIIbβ3 (21Tokuhira M. Handa M. Kamata T. Oda A. Katayama M. Tomiyama Y. Murata M. Kawai Y. Watanabe K. Ikeda Y. Thromb.

This is because this particular antibody is unable to bind to αVβ3 or V/B. In the presence of 1 mm Mn2+, although αIIbβ3 did show some binding, it was not as avid as that seen in the presence of PT25-2. By contrast, Mn2+ induced robust Fbg binding to wild-type αVβ3. These results are in agreement with previous reports. However, when α stalk was swapped, the response to Mn2+ changed completely from the wild-type. The B/V bound Fbg just as avidly as wild-type αVβ3. By contrast, V/B binding significantly decreased to a level similar to that of wild-type αIIbβ3. These results clearly indicate that the integrin α stalk, but not the head, contains the critical component that regulates Mn2+-induced integrin activation. The αV Calf-2 Domain, Not the αIIb Calf-2 Domain, Facilitates Mn2+-induced Activation—To locate the regulatory domain essential for Mn2+-induced activation, we created nine additional domain-swapping chimeras (Fig. 1A). These chimeras were created based on the domain boundaries in the αVβ3 crystal structure (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). All of them have αIIb β-propeller on the N terminus. Thus, the ligand-binding domains remain unchanged. Each chimera was designated after the domain replaced, except for the D chimera, which has αV TM and cytoplasmic domains. The chimeras were transiently expressed in CHO cells. Surface expression of each chimera was comparable (data not shown). The first set of experiments showed that TC1C2 bound Fbg just as avidly as B/V in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 1C). However, Mn2+ did not induce Fbg binding in TC1 or T. When the cells were pretreated with DTT, which is known to activate integrin, all chimeras including TC1 and T showed Fbg binding comparable to that of wild-type αIIbβ3 in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+. These results suggest that the αV calf-2 domain, but not the αV TM or cytoplasmic domains, is required for Mn2+-induced activation. It is worth noting that none of the chimeras induced constitutive activation. To determine whether αV calf-2 domain alone could facilitate αIIbβ3-Fbg interaction by Mn2+, we swapped individual domains in the next set of experiments. Although swapping individual thigh (T), calf-1 (C1), and TM-cytoplasmic (D) domains had no effect, swapping calf-2 domain (C2) resulted in robust Fbg binding in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the αV calf-2 domain has a facilitating effect on ligand binding by Mn2+, whereas the αIIb calf-2 domain lacks the same effect. To examine whether αIIb calf-2 domain alone could neutralize the activating effect of α stalk swapping, individual αIIb domain sequences were put back in the B/V chimera that shows Mn2+-induced activation. When original αIIb thigh (C1C2D), calf-1 (TC2D), TM-cytoplasmic (TC1C2) domain sequences were put back in, they did not have a significant effect on Mn2+-induced activation induced by α stalk swapping. However, when αIIb calf-2 domain sequences were put back in (TC1D), the Mn2+-induced activation was completely lost (Fig. 1E). This suppressing effect was reversed by DTT treatment. These results suggest that the differences in the response to Mn2+ between αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 can be solely attributed to the calf-2 domain. Mutation in the Cation-binding Site at α Genu Does Not Affect Mn2+-induced Ligand Binding—In the αVβ3 crystal structure, the only cation-binding site in the α stalk is located at the junction between the thigh and the calf-1 domains, but not in the calf-2 domain. To examine the effect of this cation-binding site on ligand binding, Asp599 and Glu636, which coordinate a cation at αV genu, were mutated to Ala. These two acidic residues are conserved in most integrins. Mutating individual amino acid residues to Ala did not inhibit αVβ3-Fbg interaction induced by Mn2+ (Fig. 2). It did not induce constitutive activation in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+, either. Although these results do not rule out the possibility that this cation-binding site may play some role in ligand binding, they are consistent with the results obtained using domain-swapping chimeras. Specific Amino Acid Residues at the Calf-2/EGF4-βTD Interface Regulate Mn2+-induced Ligand Binding—In the αVβ3 crystal structure, the calf-2 domain creates a 700 Å interface with EGF4 and βTD (24Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1642-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This implicates that the difference in the interaction between those membrane-proximal domains might affect Mn2+-dependent integrin activation. To explore this possibility, we mutated amino acid residues in the αIIb calf-2 domain that make up the interface. Eight non-conserved amino acid regions (amino acids 747–749, 754–758, 770, 777–779, 783, 893–894, 896–898, and 954–956) that are located at the calf-2/EGF4-βTD interface in the αVβ3 crystal structure were selected. Amino acid sequences in the homologous αIIb regions (amino acids 753–755, 760–764, 774, 781–783, 787, 899–900, 902–904, and 958–960) were replaced with the corresponding αV sequences (designated B/V 753–755, B/V 760–764, B/V 774, B/V 781–783, B/V 787, B/V 899–900, B/V 902–904, and B/V 958–960, respectively). When expressed in CHO cells, all those mutants showed comparable surface expression with wild-type αIIbβ3, except for B/V 902–904, which showed significantly lower expression (data not shown). The DTT treatment induced comparable Fbg binding in all mutants except B/V 902–904. These results suggest that whereas B/V 902–904 has an unfavorable effect on the global structure of αIIbβ3, other mutations did not. In the presence of 1 mm Mn2+, B/V 753–755, B/V 774, B/V 781–783, B/V 902–904, or B/V 958–960 showed comparable Fbg binding with wild-type αIIbβ3 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, B/V 787 and B/V 899–900 showed significantly higher Fbg binding. In addition, B/V 760–764 also showed weak but consistently higher Fbg binding than wild-type αIIbβ3. To further identify the amino acid residues in the 760–764 and 899–900 regions important for Mn2+-induced Fbg binding, individual residues in these regions were mutated. None of the single amino acid mutations in the 760–764 region induced Fbg binding equivalent to B/V 760–764. On the contrary, mutating Arg900 to Ser alone was sufficient to induce Fbg binding equivalent to B/V 899–900 (Fig. 3B). However, none of those mutations produced Fbg binding as robust as C2. Next we examined whether combining those mutations would have an additive or synergistic effect. Combining B/V 787 mutation with the B/V 899–900 or B/V 900 mutation (designated B/V 787/899–900 and B/V 787/900, respectively) did not have any significant effect (Fig. 3C). The effect of combining B/V 760–764 mutation with B/V 787/899–900 (designated B/V 760–764/787/899–900) was additive and resulted in higher Fbg binding than any one of these mutants. These results indicate that whereas B/V 787 and B/V 900 have similar effects, B/V 760–764 has an independent effect on Mn2+-induced Fbg binding. In the αVβ3 crystal structure, amino acid residues 783 and 894, which correspond to 787 and 900 in αIIb, are located next to each other and make contacts with the EGF4 domain, whereas 754–758, which corresponds to 760–764 in αIIb, is located close to the cell membrane and makes contacts with the βTD (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that the effect of calf-2 domain swapping on the Mn2+-induced ligand interaction is mediated at least in part by the specific amino acid residues in the calf-2/EGF4-βTD interface, suggesting that differences in the calf-2/EGF4 and calf-2/βTD interface interaction in two β3 integrins are indeed responsible for the distinct response to Mn2+. However, the fact that combining B/V 760–764, B/V 787, and B/V 899–900 mutations did not produce as much Fbg binding as C2 indicates that other amino acid residues in the calf-2 domain are involved. The positions of amino acid residues 839–867 in the αV calf-2 domain (842–873 in αIIb) have not been assigned in the αVβ3 crystal structure. This region may provide additional sites important for regulating integrin-ligand interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2067494482,"In response to excess iron, Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells repress transcription of genes encoding components involved in iron uptake through the Fep1 transcription factor. Fep1 mediates this control by interacting with the consensus sequence 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′, found in iron-dependent promoters. In this report, we show that Fep1 localizes to the nucleus under both iron-replete and iron-starved conditions. The Fep1 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1-241) contains two GATA-type zinc finger motifs. Although we determine that the Fep1 C-terminal zinc finger (ZF2) is essential for DNA binding, we show that the N-terminal zinc finger (ZF1) enhances DNA binding affinity ∼5-fold. Between the two zinc finger motifs of Fep1 resides an invariant amino acid sequence, denoted the Cys-rich region (amino acids 68-94), in which four highly conserved Cys residues are found. Cells harboring mutant alleles in which two or more of the conserved Cys residues were substituted by alanine exhibited elevated fio1+ mRNA levels. We determine that the dissociation constant for the resulting complex between each of the Cys mutants and the sequence 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′ reflects a much lower affinity that correlates with failure to repress fio1+ gene expression. Deletion analysis identified two heptad repeats (amino acids 522-536) within the C-terminal region of Fep1 that are necessary and sufficient to mediate Fep1 dimerization. Moreover, mutations that impair dimerization also negatively affect transcriptional repression. Together these findings reveal several novel features of Fep1, a non-canonical GATA factor required for iron homeostasis.

The transition metal iron is both essential and, at high levels, toxic to cells (1Beutler E. Science. 2004; 306: 2051-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U.

The essentiality of iron is derived from its ability to cycle between two redox states, oxidized Fe3+ and reduced Fe2+. This redox property of iron makes it a suitable catalytic cofactor for several enzymes that carry out critical biological processes, including DNA synthesis, respiration, the citric acid cycle, and photosynthesis (5Andrews N.C.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2374-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In excess, iron can have deleterious effects by reacting with hydrogen peroxide or dioxygen to produce hydroxyl radical, a free radical species that is responsible for cellular damage such as lipid peroxidation, oxidation of proteins, and cleavage of DNA or RNA molecules (7Halliwell B.

Cells therefore possess mechanisms to ensure that sufficient and non-toxic levels of iron are present in the cell at all times (2Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C.

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, two pathways have been identified for iron assimilation (15Schrettl M. Winkelmann G. Haas H. BioMetals. 2004; 17: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The first system consists of the production and secretion of a hydroxamate-type siderophore (15Schrettl M. Winkelmann G. Haas H. BioMetals. 2004; 17: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Once secreted, this ferric ionchelating compound, named ferrichrome, can be recaptured and imported into the fission yeast cell as siderophore-iron complexes. Although the fission yeast produces the extracellular hydroxamate siderophore ferrichrome, S. pombe can also take up another type of siderophore, ferrioxamine B, when secreted into the environment by other microorganisms (18Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Philpott C.C. Labbé S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4332-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To date three genes, str1+, str2+, and potentially str3+ genes have been identified whose products are involved in uptake of siderophore-bound iron (18Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Philpott C.C. Labbé S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4332-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Of these three siderophore transporters, Str1 exhibits specificity for ferrichrome-iron, whereas Str2 is specific for ferrioxamine B-iron and to a lesser extent ferrichrome-iron (18Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Philpott C.C. Labbé S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4332-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although Str3 may participate in the mobilization of iron bound to siderophores, its substrate specificity has not been determined. In S. pombe, a second system for iron uptake involves reduction of iron from Fe3+ to Fe2+ by the Frp1 cell surface ferrireductase (17Roman D.G. Dancis A. Anderson G.J. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Subsequent to reduction, iron is transported across the plasma membrane by a bipartite protein complex composed of the multicopper oxidase Fio1 and the transmembrane permease Fip1 (16Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Within this two-component iron transporting complex, Fio1 can re-oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+, which is then transported into the cell by the high affinity carrier Fip1. Under conditions of iron starvation, frp1+, fio1+, fip1+, str1+, str2+, and str3+ mRNA levels are strongly induced, whereas under iron-replete conditions, expression of these genes is inactivated (16Askwith C.

The promoter element necessary for iron-mediated repression of the frp1+, fio1+, fip1+, str1+, str2+, and str3+ genes has been determined to be a GATA-type regulatory sequence 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′ (18Pelletier B.

Consistently, the sensor for down-regulating expression of these genes in the presence of exogenous iron has been demonstrated to be Fep1, a member of the GATA factor protein family (18Pelletier B.

We have identified two proteins, Tup11 and Tup12, which act as corepressors for iron-mediated transcriptional repression (19Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol.

We demonstrated that Tup11 and Fep1 physically interact with each other for down-regulation of iron uptake genes (21Znaidi S. Pelletier B. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9462-9474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The C-terminal amino acids from residues 405 to 541 are required for this interaction (21Znaidi S. Pelletier B. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9462-9474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, this region of Fep1 is highly similar to the N-terminal regions of the Urbs1, SRE, SREA, and Sfu1 proteins that have been shown to play a role in the regulation of iron-responsive genes of Ustilago maydis, Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans, and Candida albicans, respectively (22An Z.

Within their N termini, these regulators harbor two Cys2/Cys2-type zinc fingers and a highly conserved intervening Cys-rich region located between the two zinc fingers (25Harrison K.A. Marzluf G.A.

We refer to these domains as the N-terminal zinc finger (ZF1), 1The abbreviations used are: ZF1, N-terminal zinc finger; ZF2, C-terminal zinc finger; BPS, bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid; EGS, ethyleneglycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate); Fep1, Fe protein 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; TAP, tandem affinity purification; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. and the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF2), according to their relative positions in the GATA-type protein. Although Urbs1, SRE, and SREA share a common highly conserved N terminus, there are marked differences with respect to the amino acid sequences required for their respective functions. In U. maydis, Urbs1 requires only ZF2 to bind DNA and regulate siderophore biosynthesis as a function of iron availability (23An Z. Zhao Q. McEvoy J. Yuan W.M. Markley J.L. Leong S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5882-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In N. crassa, although ZF2 plays a more important role in DNA binding in vitro, results suggest that both the N- and C-terminal zinc fingers of SRE are required for DNA binding (24Zhou L.W. Marzluf G.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mutations affecting either or both SRE zinc fingers block the ability of the transcription factor to negatively regulate siderophore gene expression under high iron concentrations (24Zhou L.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22576-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the DNA binding domain of SREA expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli requires the presence of both zinc finger motifs for specific DNA binding (26Haas H. Zadra I. Stoffler G. Angermayr K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4613-4619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In SRE, the four highly conserved Cys residues found between the two zinc finger motifs have been mutated, resulting in constitutive repression of target genes in the presence or absence of iron. Consistently, these mutant versions of SRE retain the ability to bind to DNA (25Harrison K.A. Marzluf G.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15288-15295Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To gain additional insight into functional features of iron-regulatory GATA-type transcriptional repressors, we performed a detailed structure-function analysis of the Fep1 protein. We determined that a functional Fep1-GFP fusion protein localizes to the S. pombe nucleus. Furthermore, its nuclear localization remains unchanged in response to variations in iron levels. We found that the presence of both finger domains is required for iron-dependent down-regulation of fio1+ gene expression. Precisely, we show that ZF2 is necessary for Fep1 to interact with the 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′ sequence in vitro. Furthermore, we determine that a truncated form of Fep1 in which ZF1 was removed exhibits a much lower DNA affinity (∼5-fold) that correlates with failure to down-regulate fio1+ gene expression. We demonstrate that mutation of the first two, the last two, or all four invariant Cys residues found between the two zinc finger motifs blocks iron repression by Fep1 and results in lower binding affinities for GATA elements in vitro. We determined that a leucine zipper domain, residues 522-536, included within the C-terminal region of Fep1 is essential for Fep1-Fep1 dimer formation and critical for full transcriptional repression. Taken together, our data show that both zinc fingers in concert with the Cys-rich region are required to allow maximal Fep1 DNA binding, resulting in repressing fio1+ gene expression under iron-replete conditions. Furthermore, Fep1 dimerization increases its potency as a transcriptional repressor. Strains and Culture Conditions—The S. pombe strains used in this study were the wild type FY435 (h+ his7-366 leu1-32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210) and the fep1Δ mutant strain (h+ his7-366 leu1-32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210 fep1Δ::ura4+) (19Pelletier B.

Fission yeast cells were maintained in yeast extract plus supplements medium. Under selection, cells were grown in Edinburgh minimal medium with necessary auxotrophic requirements (32Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeasts: Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Iron deprivation or iron repletion was carried out by adding the indicated amount of bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid (BPS) or FeCl3 to cells grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 nm of ∼1.0). After treatments at 30 °C for 90 min, 20-ml samples were withdrawn from the cultures for subsequent steady-state mRNA or protein analyses (33Beaudoin J. Mercier A. Langlois R. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14565-14577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To assess the phleomycin-sensitive growth phenotype, 20 μg/ml phleomycin (Sigma) was added to yeast extract plus supplements as described previously (19Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22950-22958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). DNA Constructs—The S. pombe fep1+ promoter up to -1478 from the start codon of the fep1+ gene was isolated by PCR and then inserted into the pJK148 vector (34Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the SacII and BamHI sites. The resulting plasmid was denoted pJK-1478fep1+prom. The fep1+ open reading frame was isolated by PCR from genomic DNA of the wild type FY435 strain. The PCR product obtained was digested with XhoI, filled-in with Klenow, and digested with BamHI. The purified DNA fragment was cloned via XhoI (Klenow) and BamHI sites into the SmaI and BamHI sites of the pJK-1478fep1+prom plasmid to generate pJK-1478fep1+. Therefore, we ensured that the fep1+ gene was under the control of its own promoter, once integrated in the genome. The gfp gene was isolated by PCR from the pSF-GP1 plasmid (35Kim J. Hirsch J.P. Genetics. 1998; 149: 795-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the primers contained SstI and NsiI restriction sites, the purified DNA fragment was digested with these enzymes and cloned into the pGEM-7Zf(+) vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Subsequently, a 1563-bp SphI-SstI PCR-amplified fragment containing the last 520 codons of the fep1+ open reading frame was isolated. The SphI-SstI DNA fragment was inserted into the SphI-SstI-cut pGEMgfp plasmid, creating a chimeric plasmid that has the last 520 codons of fep1+ fused to GFP. The gfp open reading frame, in which a XhoI restriction site was previously engineered by PCR and placed immediately after the stop codon, was used in combination with SphI to isolate the gfp gene in-frame with the C-terminal region of Fep1. The purified DNA fragment was cloned into pSP1-1478fep1+ codons 1-44 to generate a plasmid that encodes a full-length Fep1-GFP fusion protein. Once generated, the fep1+-gfp fusion allele was isolated using XhoI (Klenow) and BamHI and subcloned into pJK-1478fep1+prom to create pJK-1478fep1+-GFP. To generate the fep1-R184A-R185A-D186A-E187A allele, the primers FEP1RRDEMUT-UP (5′-CAAATACTCCTTTGTGGCTCCTCGCCGTGTCGGGTAATCCGATCTG-3′) and FEP1RRDEMUT-LO (5′-CAGATCGGATTACCCGACACGGCGAGGAGCCACAAAGGAGTATTTG-3′) were made with mutations (underlined) and utilized in the overlap extension method as described previously (36Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) to generate the R184A, R185A, D186A, and E187A substitutions within the fep1+ gene. Using the pJK-1478fep1+-GFP plasmid, a set of deletions (5-59Δ, 5-129Δ, and 5-261Δ) was made within the N-terminal portion of Fep1. Three primers containing a BamHI site and the first four codons of the fep1+ gene were engineered to anneal pairwise to DNA at codons 60, 130, and 262 of fep1+, respectively. The antisense primer for amplification contained a BlpI restriction site. The DNA sequence from each respective PCR-amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and BlpI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pJK-1478fep1+-GFP. The fep1+ allele was amplified by PCR using primers designed to generate BamHI and NotI sites at the upstream and downstream termini of the open reading frame. Once generated, the DNA fragment was inserted into the corresponding sites of pREP1-NTAP (37Tasto J.J. Carnahan R.H. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Yeast. 2001; 18: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, named pNTAPfep1+, was subsequently digested with PacI, treated with mung bean nuclease, and then digested with SpeI to produce a DNA fragment corresponding to the TAP tag fused to the first 149 codons of Fep1. This latter fragment was swapped for an identical DNA region into the pJK-1478fep1+ plasmid using the BamHI (Klenow) and SpeI sites to create the pJK-1478-NTAPfep1+ plasmid. To create truncations from the C-terminal end of NTAP-Fep1, the fep1+ gene starting at +446 after the start codon up to +723, +954, +1077, +1473, or +1623 was amplified using primers designed to introduce SpeI and PstI at the termini of the upstream and downstream DNA fragments, respectively. The PCR products obtained were digested with SpeI and PstI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pJK-1478NTAPfep1+ to generate plasmids pJK-1478NTAPfep1-M241, pJK-1478NTAPfep1M318, pJK-1478NTAPfep1M359, pJK-1478-NTAPfep1M491, and pJK-1478NTAPfep1M541. To create the fep1 mutant alleles C70A/C76A, C85A/C88A, and C70A/C76A/C85A/C88A, the plasmid pJK-1478fep1+-GFP was used in conjunction with the overlap extension method (36Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotides FEP1C70AC76A-UP (5′-GCAAGTTTGTAAAAACGGAACCGCTGCTGGAGATGGATTCGCTAACGGTACGGGTGGCAG-3′), FEP1C70AC76A-LO (5′-CTGCCACCCGTACCGTTAGCGAATCCATCTCCAGCAGCGGTTCCGTTTTTACAAACTTGC-3′), FEP1C85AC88A-UP (5′-CGGGTGGCAGTGCTTCAGCTACTGGTGCTCCTGCTTTAAATAATCG-3′), and FEP1C85AC88A-LO (5′-CGATTATTTAAAGCAGGAGCACCAGTAGCTGAAGCACTGCCACCCG-3′) (underlined letters represent nucleotide substitutions that gave rise to mutations). To generate the fep1MutLI → A allele, the primer FEP1MUTLI-A (5′-CATTGTCAGAGGACCTCGGCCATTCATCTGGTTGTTGAGGGTGCTGATTTGGATTGTGCGGCTCCTGAATCA-3′) was made corresponding to the end of the fep1+ gene with mutations (underlined) in the sequence that generated the L522A, L525A, I529A, I532A, and L536A substitutions. Furthermore, the primer was designed to ensure the presence of the PpuMI restriction site found naturally at the end of the gene. Using a second primer that hybridized downstream at the BlpI restriction site, a 804-bp BlpI-PpuMI fragment was amplified by PCR and then used to replace the equivalent wild type fep1+ DNA segment in pJK-1478fep1+-GFP. Assays—To perform the RNase protection analyses as described previously (19Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22950-22958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), plasmids pSKfio1+ and pSKact1+ were used for producing antisense RNA probes, allowing the detection of steady-state levels of fio1+ and act1+ mRNAs, respectively. Immunodetection of Fep1-GFP and PCNA proteins was conducted with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody B-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal anti-PCNA antibody PC10 (Sigma), respectively. Fluorescence and differential interference contrast images of the cells were obtained on an Eclipse E800 epifluorescent microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) equipped with an ORCA ER digital cooled camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). Cells were grown in yeast extract plus supplements medium to A600 of 1.0 and then BPS (100 μm) or FeCl3 (100 μm) was added. After 90 min incubation at 30 °C, Hoechst 33342 stain (Sigma) was added to 1 ml of each cell culture to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml for DNA staining. Cells were washed with medium, mixed with 1% low melting agarose, and mounted onto glass slides. The samples were subjected to microscopy analysis, using ×1000 magnification and the following filters: 465-495 (GFP) and 340-380 (Hoechst). His-tagged Fep1 proteins were affinity purified from E. coli extracts using nickel-agarose chromatography and the purity of the proteins determined by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For EGS cross-linking experiments, purified His6-Fep1 fusion proteins were diluted into buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) to a final concentration of 1 μg. EGS was added to concentrations specified in Fig. 10, incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, and quenched with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The cross-linking proteins were resolved by electrophoresis through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-His antibody 34460 (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON).Fig. 1The stability and localization of Fep1-GFP are unaffected by cellular iron status.

Cells expressing the Fep1-GFP fusion protein were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and then treated with either BPS (100 μm) or FeCl3 (100 μm) for 3 h. The cells were visualized for GFP by fluorescence microscopy (top panel). Hoescht was used to stain the nucleus (middle panel), and Nomarski optics (bottom panel) was utilized to monitor cell morphology.

ERBB4 activities in the breast are mediated through the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family member STAT5A, and ERBB4 directly activates STAT5A, in part, through phosphorylation of STAT5A at the regulatory Tyr-694. Here we show that STAT5A regulation by ERBB4 is also mediated through STAT5A serine phosphorylation. Using a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis of proteolytically digested STAT5A coexpressed with ERBB4, we identified STAT5A serine phosphorylations at the previously described Ser-779 and at the novel Ser-127/Ser-128. Immunohistochemistry of wild-type and ERBB4-null mammary glands at late pregnancy showed that ERBB4 expression was required for STAT5A phosphorylation at Ser-779. Independent serine-to-alanine residue substitutions in full-length STAT5A revealed that although STAT5A Ser-779 phosphorylation was dispensable for phosphorylation of STAT5A at Tyr-694 and subsequent DNA binding, Ser-779 was required to stabilize an interaction with ERBB4 and mediate ERBB4-induced STAT5A stimulation of gene expression. STAT5A Ser-127/Ser-128, on the other hand, was required for ERBB4-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-694, whereas Ser-779 and as yet unidentified tyrosine residues were phosphorylated in the absence of Ser-127/Ser-128. In addition, STAT5A S127A/S128A remained associated with ERBB4 but failed to bind DNA or activate transcription in response to ERBB4 coexpression.

https://openalex.org/W1989478497,"Intracellular pathogens have developed strategies to survive for extended periods inside their host cells. These include avoidance of host microbicidal effectors, often by sequestration in a protected subcompartment of the host cell. In some cases, the parasites exert also an antiapoptotic effect that prolongs the life of the infected host cell. Chlamydia utilizes both strategies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Comparatively, little is known regarding the effects that Chlamydia exerts on the metabolism and distribution of the host cell lipids. The expression of fluorescently tagged C1 domains revealed that diacylglycerol is greatly accumulated in the immediate vicinity of Chlamydia inclusion vacuoles. The concentrated diacylglycerol recruits protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), a proapoptotic effector, to the immediate vicinity of the vacuole. PKCδ normally exerts its pro-apoptotic effects at the mitochondria and in the nucleus. We speculate that Chlamydia antagonizes the pro-apoptotic effect of PKCδ by sequestering the enzyme on the inclusion vacuole away from its conventional target sites. Accordingly, we found that the ectopic expression of a catalytic fragment of PKCδ that cannot be recruited by the vacuole, because it lacks a functional C1 domain, overcame the anti-apoptotic effect of the bacteria. The scavenging of pro-apoptotic factors may provide a novel mechanism whereby pathogens promote their own survival by extending the life of the host cells they infect.

Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular pathogen, propagates within large inclusion vacuoles in host cells. While secluded in the inclusion vacuole, Chlamydia not only evades immune surveillance but also avoids exposure to the microbicidal contents of the host cell lysosomes. In addition, Chlamydia manages to survive for extended periods, at least in part, by exerting an anti-apoptotic effect on host cells (1Fan T. Lu H. Hu H. Shi L. McClarty G.A. Nance D.M. Greenberg A.H. Zhong G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 2Dean D. Powers V.C. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2442-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As a result, chronic infection by Chlamydia is a common occurrence, causing sustained inflammation of the genitourinary tract, eye, joints, and/or blood vessels. Little is known regarding the mechanism whereby Chlamydia antagonizes apoptosis of infected host cells. It has been demonstrated that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the subsequent activation of an apoptotic protease, caspase 3, are impaired in infected cells (1Fan T. Lu H. Hu H. Shi L. McClarty G.A. Nance D.M. Greenberg A.H. Zhong G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 2Dean D. Powers V.C. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2442-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Very recently, the destruction of the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim/Bod, Puma, and Bad during infection was shown to contribute to the anti-apoptotic effect (3Fischer S.F. Vier J. Kirschnek S. Klos A. Hess S. Ying S. Häcker G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, the events that precede and trigger these abnormalities are not clear.

PKCs, a lipid-dependent family of serine/threonine kinases, are grouped into three subfamilies based on their structure. Classical (α, β, γ) and novel (η, ϵ, δ, θ) PKCs contain a diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding domain, known as the C1 cassette, which is required for optimal catalytic activity but is missing in the atypical (ι, ζ) isotypes. Importantly, PKCδ is a pro-apoptotic regulator. When activated, PKCδ is cleaved, releasing a catalytically active fragment that translocates to the mitochondria, where it promotes the release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of the apoptotic pathway (4Li L.

PKCδ also promotes inactivation of DNA-dependent protein kinases responsible for the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (8Bharti A. Kraeft S.K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.M.

Watters D. Lord J.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2331-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Because it is situated upstream of cytochrome c release in the apoptotic pathway, we considered whether PKCδ is involved in mediating the anti-apoptotic effect of Chlamydia. This study demonstrates that Chlamydia sequesters the majority of the enzyme on the inclusion vacuole. Recruitment of PKCδ by the chlamydial vacuole requires DAG and is mediated by the C1 domain of the kinase. We propose that, by diverting PKCδ to the vacuole away from the cellular targets that trigger apoptosis, Chlamydia may prevent the host cells from undergoing apoptotic suicide.

Each well was infected by the addition of 0.5 ml of Chlamydia stock (∼106 elementary bodies/ml). The plates were centrifuged at 2000 RPM for 30 min to sediment the bacteria on the cells, and infected cells were then incubated for the indicated time at 37 °C. Apoptosis Determinations—Apoptosis was induced by the addition of etoposide (10 μg/ml) followed by incubation at 37 °C for the specified time period. Apoptosis was assessed after staining the cells with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or Hoechst 33342 dye (ATCC) by monitoring nuclear morphology. Images were obtained using a Leica IRE DR2 inverted microscope with an Orca II ER camera (Hamamatsu) driven by the OpenLab 3 software (Improvision) and a ×100 oil immersion objective with appropriate filter sets. Apoptotic cells were identified by their characteristic nuclear changes (condensation, lobulation, and fragmentation). In some experiments, the blebbing characteristic of apoptotic cells was verified, visualizing the fluorescence of pm-GFP and the morphology of the cells by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. A minimum of 100 cells was quantified and scored in each individual coverslip. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. To label the Golgi apparatus, cells underwent permeabilization and blocking in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% milk followed by immunostaining with anti-mouse GM130 (1:250) and Cy3-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibodies (1:800). Samples were analyzed using a Leica DMIRB fluorescence microscope, acquiring images digitally utilizing a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Micromax, Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) controlled by the Winview software. ×100 oil immersion objectives were used alongside appropriate filter sets. All of the cells and inclusion bodies were identified under DIC optics. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. To determine whether PKCδ mediates one of the anti-apoptotic effects exerted by Chlamydia, we analyzed nuclear condensation in HeLa cells stained with DAPI. Nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation are hallmarks of apoptosis (12Martelli A.M. Zweyer M. Ochs R.L. Tazzari P.L. Tabellini G. Narducci P. Bortul R. J. Cell.

Nearly 40% cells treated with etoposide (10 μg/ml) for 24 h showed distinct signs of apoptosis (Fig. 1, A and E). This figure is probably an underestimate, because the density of cells remaining on the coverslips was decreased compared with untreated controls, probably by detachment of cells in advanced states of apoptosis. The involvement of PKCδ as one of the inducers of apoptosis by etoposide was suggested by the preventive effects of rottlerin. This potent and reportedly specific inhibitor of PKCδ (17Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) decreased the incidence of nuclear condensation by ≥75% and prevented the detachment of cells induced by etoposide (Fig. 1, B and E). A remarkably similar phenotype was observed when the cells were infected by Chlamydia 10 h before the addition of etoposide (Fig. 1, D and E). Infection by Chlamydia in the absence of etoposide had no discernible effect on either cell survival or nuclear condensation (Fig. 1C). These observations suggest that Chlamydia might impair cellular apoptosis in part through alteration of PKCδ. The preceding observations warranted more detailed analysis of PKCδ in Chlamydia-infected cells. Because other isoforms have effects on apoptosis (PKCα and the atypical PKCs have anti-apoptotic effects (18Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 19Gubina E. Rinaudo M.S. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Mufson R.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)), we compared the distribution of different PKC classes in control and infected cells. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged constructs of classical (α, β), novel (δ), or atypical (ζ) isoforms of PKC. As reported earlier, in otherwise unstimulated cells, PKCα was homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). This distribution persisted in Chlamydia-infected cells where the formation of inclusion vacuoles was visible as zones of exclusion of the fluorescent kinase (Fig. 2, B-C). Similar results were obtained when analyzing the distribution of the atypical PKCζ (Fig. 2, G-I). In untreated cells, PKCδ was also found in the cytosol; however, a considerable fraction was associated with a juxtanuclear organelle, characterized earlier as the Golgi complex (21Perego C. Porro C. La Porta C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The distinctive behavior of classical and novel PKC isoforms, despite their common ability to bind DAG, has been attributed to their differential ability to associate with other ligands such as arachidonic acid, ceramide, phosphatidylserine, or PKC-adaptor proteins including β-coatomer proteins (22Shultz A. Ling M. Larsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31750-31760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M. Ananthanarayanan B. Rafter J.D.

Rafter J.D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19784-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the vast majority of the novel kinase relocalized to the inclusion vacuole and/or its immediate vicinity when cells were infected by Chlamydia (Fig. 2, D-F). The selective redistribution of PKCδ in infected cells suggests that prolonged cell survival may be due to neutralization of its pro-apoptotic effect and not to activation of the anti-apoptotic isoforms (PKCα and PKCζ). Sequestration of PKCδ to the inclusion vacuole or its immediate vicinity and away from its mitochondrial and nuclear targets might suffice to preclude its pro-apoptotic effect. We proceeded to analyze the mechanism whereby PKCδ relocalizes to the inclusion vacuole. The C1 domain of PKCδ is required for its membrane association, apparently by interaction with lipid moieties such as DAG or sphingolipids, both of which are present in the Golgi (25Baron C.L. Malhotra V. Science. 2002; 295: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 26Kajimoto T. Ohmori S. Shira I.Y. Sakai N. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1769-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the components of the chlamydial inclusion membrane have not been fully characterized, it probably contains lipids found in the Golgi since traffic between this organelle and the inclusion membrane was reported (27Hackstadt T. Rockey D.D. Heinzen R.A. Scidmore M.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 964-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 28Scidmore M.A. Fischer E.R. Hackstadt T. J.

A. 1995; 92: 4877-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the contribution of the C1 domain in the recruitment of the kinase to chlamydial vacuoles. The C1 cassette excised from PKCδ was fused to GFP and expressed in HeLa cells. As illustrated in Fig. 2J, the chimeric C1 domain localized in intact cells in a manner that resembled the distribution of the full-length kinase. More importantly, the excised C1 domain was also avidly sequestered by the inclusion vacuole following Chlamydia infection (Fig. 2, K-L). The ligands that direct the C1 domain of PKCδ to the inclusion vacuole were investigated next. C1 domains recognize DAG and sphingolipids in the context of ancillary protein moieties. To ensure that interaction with the lipids was the determinant factor, we performed competition experiments. In addition to binding endogenous lipids, C1 domains interact strongly with phorbol esters (30Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4868-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 31Burns D.J. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18330-18338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are tumor promoters. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, inset, the C1 domain is effectively displaced upon the addition of PMA from the Golgi and cytosol to the plasma membrane where the tumor promoter partitions preferentially. There are two main cellular sources of DAG: the hydrolysis of phospholipids by phospholipase C and the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid. The latter pathway, which is thought to be the major source of DAG for the Golgi complex (32Sweeney D.A. Siddhanta A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3030-3039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), can be impaired by propranolol, a potent blocker of phosphatidic acid phosphatase. Consistent with this finding, the addition of propranolol to the HeLa cells displaced the C1 domain from the Golgi of uninfected cells (Fig. 3B) without affecting the structure or distribution of the Golgi complex (e.g. Fig. 3B, right inset). When both propranolol and PMA were present, the C1 domain was targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B, left inset), implying that propranolol affected DAG generation and not the behavior of the probe. More importantly, the phosphatase inhibitor similarly induced the loss of the C1 domain from Chlamydia inclusion vacuoles (Fig. 3D). Similar results were obtained using the full-length kinase (not illustrated). These observations confirm that lipid binding is indeed the determinant of C1 and PKCδ association with the Chlamydia vacuoles and point to DAG and not sphingolipids as the predominant ligand. The latter notion was further substantiated using LY-B cells, a Chinese hamster ovary line with a mutation in serine palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and l-serine to produce 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, the initial step in the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids (10Hanada K. Nishijima M. Fujita T. Kobayashi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1211-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Under conditions where the LY-B cells fail to synthesize ceramide derivatives, the C1 domain nevertheless remained associated with the Golgi complex of uninfected cells (Fig. 3E). Following infection, the C1 cassette translocated to the inclusion vacuoles, despite the depletion of ceramide (Fig. 3F). In accordance with these observations, we also found that the distribution of the C1 domain in both uninfected and infected cells was not altered by pretreatment with fumonisin (Fig. 3, G-H), a potent inhibitor of dihydrosphingosine-N-acyltransferase, which is responsible for the production of dihydroceramide, an upstream precursor of ceramide synthesis (33Merrill A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when we tested the effects of the ceramide antagonists on the localization of the full-length PKCδ (results not shown). Jointly, these results suggest that DAG, as opposed to sphingolipids, is the primary determinant of PKCδ recruitment to the Chlamydia inclusion vacuole. The preceding observations implicate PKCδ in the anti-apoptotic effect exerted by Chlamydia. The bacteria may prevent cell death by recruiting the kinase to the inclusion vacuole, diverting it away from sites such as mitochondria and the nucleus where the apoptotic effect is normally exerted. If this hypothesis is correct, interference with the ability of PKCδ to bind to the vacuole would favor the apoptosis of cells infected with Chlamydia. Because DAG was established to direct the kinase to the vacuole, this could in principle be accomplished by infection of cells in medium containing propranolol. However, we found that incubation with propranolol for the extended period required for assessment of apoptosis was toxic to the cells. As an alternative approach, we used a truncated mutant of PKCδ that lacks the targeting C1 domain. Deletion of the N-terminal 325 residues of PKCδ yields a catalytically active fragment (CFδ) that is no longer dependent on DAG for its targeting or activity (11DeVries T.A. Neville M.C. Reyland M.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6050-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 34Hausser A. Link G. Bamberg L. Burzlaff A. Lutz S. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), as confirmed by its inability to accumulate in the Golgi complex (Fig. 4A). In agreement with earlier results (11DeVries T.A. Neville M.C. Reyland M.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6050-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Reyland M.E. Anderson S.M. Matassa A.A. Barzen K.A. Quissell D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19115-19123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we found that expression of a GFP-tagged CFδ in HeLa cells effectively induced apoptosis. Nearly 70% cells transfected with this chimeric construct underwent programmed cell death after 24 h, visualized as nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 4). Apoptosis was caused by the catalytic activity of the fragment, because transfection with a kinase-dead form of the fragment (CFδKD) had no significant effect on cell death (Fig. 4J). The effect of CFδ was next tested on cells infected with Chlamydia. It was notable that, unlike the full-length kinase, the CFδ was not recruited preferentially to the vacuole but instead retained access to other cellular compartments. The catalytic fragment also promoted apoptosis in cells infected 6 h after transfection, a time chosen to allow the expression of the construct. The extent of apoptosis was virtually identical to that seen in uninfected cells and much greater than that noted in CFδKD transfected and in untransfected cells (Fig. 4, H-J). It was conceivable that, by transfecting the cells before infection, they had entered an irreversible apoptosis program before the bacteria could exert its anti-apoptotic effects. To analyze this possibility, the experiments were also performed in the reverse order, infecting before transfection. Similar results were obtained whether CFδ transfection was performed 6 h before or 6 h after bacterial infection (Fig. 4J, cf. solid and open bars). These findings indicate that, although Chlamydia infection can overcome the apoptosis induced by activation of the full-length endogenous PKCδ, it is unable to prevent the effect of the C1-deficient CFδ. Therefore, we conclude that the ability of the Chlamydia vacuole to sequester PKCδ is essential for its anti-apoptotic action. In summary, our findings suggest that Chlamydia may prevent apoptosis of infected host cells, at least in part, by disabling the pro-apoptotic effect of PKCδ. Impairment of the apoptotic action of the kinase appears to be due to its sequestration onto the vacuole and away from the normal mitochondrial and nuclear targets that initiate cell death and not due to the direct impairment of its catalytic activity. This was verified by the addition of PMA, which not only displaced the kinase from the vacuole but induced its activation, measured by autophosphorylation of Ser-643 (not illustrated). The targeting of C1 domains to the vacuole and its sensitivity to inhibitors of phosphatidate phosphatase, but not to ceramide antagonists, suggest that the membrane limiting the Chlamydia inclusion is rich in DAG. Unfortunately, it is currently impossible to isolate vacuolar membranes of sufficient purity and quantity to verify this assumption by direct biochemical means. Regardless of the mechanism of recruitment, it is clear that these bacteria have the unique ability to induce a gross yet selective redistribution of pro-apoptotic kinases while leaving the anti-apoptotic isoforms unaltered and that bypassing such recruitment by expression of the CFδ overcomes the pro-survival effect of Chlamydia. Thus, the scavenging of pro-apoptotic factors emerges as a possible novel mechanism to delay programmed cell death, which can be used by pathogens to extend the life of the host cells.

https://openalex.org/W2031725832,"Exposure of cells to a wide variety of chemoprotective compounds confers resistance to a broad set of carcinogens. For a subset of the chemoprotective compounds, protection is generated by an increase in the abundance of phase 2 detoxification enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Transcription factor Nrf2, which is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1) under unstimulated conditions, regulates the induction of phase 2 enzymes. In this study, to explore the role of the proteasome in the detoxification response, we tested the effect of proteasome inhibitors such as MG132, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, and lactacystin on the induction of GST isozymes and found that these inhibitors selectively induced the class Pi GST isozyme (GST P1). Down-regulation of the proteasome by antisense oligonucleotides or RNA interference indeed resulted in significant up-regulation of GST P1, suggesting that a decline in the proteasome activity could be directly or indirectly linked to the induction of GST P1. From the functional analysis of various deletion constructs of the upstream regulatory region of the GST P1 promoter, GST P1 enhancer I was identified as the response element for proteasome inhibition. Overexpression of the wild-type and dominant-negative forms of Nrf2 and Keap1 had little effect on the induction of GST P1 not only by the proteasome inhibitor, but also by phase 2-inducing isothiocyanate, suggesting that there may be a process of GST P1 induction distinct from other phase 2 gene induction mechanisms. Because GST P1 is highly and specifically induced during early hepatocarcinogenesis as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, these data may provide a potential critical role for the proteasome in the induction of a cellular defense program associated with carcinogenesis.

Xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes play a major role in regulating the toxic, oxidative damaging, mutagenic, and neoplastic effects of chemical carcinogens. Mounting evidence has indicated that the induction of phase 2 detoxification enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) 1The abbreviations used are: GSTs, glutathione S-transferases; ARE, antioxidant response element; MCA, methylcoumarin amide; 6-HITC, 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; RNAi, RNA interference; GPEI, glutathione S-transferase P1 enhancer I; TRE, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: GSTs, glutathione S-transferases; ARE, antioxidant response element; MCA, methylcoumarin amide; 6-HITC, 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; RNAi, RNA interference; GPEI, glutathione S-transferase P1 enhancer I; TRE, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. results in protection against toxicity and chemical carcinogenesis, especially during the initiation phase. The GSTs are a family of enzymes that catalyze the nucleophilic addition of the thiol of GSH to a variety of electrophiles (for a review, see Ref. 1Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar). In addition, the GSTs bind with varying affinities to a variety of aromatic hydrophobic compounds. It is now generally accepted that the GSTs are encoded by at least five different gene families. Four of the gene families (classes Alpha, Mu, Pi, and Theta) encode the cytosolic GSTs, whereas the fifth encodes a microsomal form of the enzyme. It has been shown that the induction of GST is associated with the reduced incidence and multiplicity of tumors (2Wattenberg L.W. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2448-2453PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wattenberg L.W. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The induction of phase 2 enzymes such as GSTs is reported to be evoked by an extraordinary variety of chemical agents, including Michael reaction acceptors, diphenols, quinones, isothiocyanates, peroxides, vicinal dimercaptans, and others (4Prestera T.

With few exceptions, these agents are electrophiles, and accordingly, many of these inducers are substrates for the phase 2 detoxification enzymes.The transcriptional activation of the phase 2 enzymes has been traced to a cis-acting transcriptional enhancer called an antioxidant response element (ARE) (7Rushmore T.H. King R.G. Paulson K.E. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3826-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) or, alternatively, the electrophile response element (8Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Nrf2, a member of the NF-E2 family of nuclear basic leucine zipper transcription factors, binds to the ARE and accelerates the transcription of cognate genes (9Chui D.H. Tang W. Orkin S.H. Biochem.

Under basal conditions, Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1), a recently identified protein associated with the actin cytoskeleton, binds very tightly to Nrf2, anchors this transcription factor in the cytoplasm, and targets it for ubiquitination and proteasome degradation, thereby repressing the ability of Nrf2 to induce phase 2 detoxification enzyme genes (12Itoh K.

Inducers disrupt the Keap1-Nrf2 complex by modifying two (Cys273 and Cys288) of the 25 cysteine residues of Keap1 (18Wakabayashi N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A.

The proteasome is a large multisubunit protease complex that selectively degrades intracellular proteins (19Tanaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 123: 195-204Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 20Tanaka K. Chiba T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Tanahashi N. Kawahara H. Murakami Y. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the proteins removed by these proteases are tagged for destruction by ubiquitination. The proteasome plays a role in controlling cellular processes such as metabolism and the cell cycle through the signal-mediated proteolysis of key enzymes and regulatory proteins. It also operates in the stress response by removing abnormal proteins and in the immune response by generating antigenic peptides. Our findings therefore suggest that down-regulation of the proteasome may represent an important indirect action of anti-carcinogenic chemicals that can contribute to their protective effects against chronic diseases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—MG132 and lactacystin were obtained from Peptide Institute, Inc.

The antisense oligonucleotide for the proteasome C2 subunit was obtained from Sigma: sense, 5′-CACCATGTTTCGAAA-3′; and antisense, 5′-TTTCGAAACATGGTG-3′. 6-Methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC) was a kind gift of Dr. Yasujiro Morimitsu (Ochanomizu University). All other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka).Cell Culture—RL34 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. The cells were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 588 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 0.16% NaHCO3 at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.Proteasome Activity—The peptidase activity of the proteasome was measured using three peptidase activities (chymotrypsin-like, trypsinlike, and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase) with fluorogenic peptides as substrates. Cells transfected with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or small interfering RNA (siRNA) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in 0.8% digitonin (pH 7.8) containing 2 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. Afterward, the lysates were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected as whole cell extracts. The activities of the proteasome were measured as follows. Whole cell extracts were incubated with 200 μm fluorogenic peptide substrates for 30 min at 37 °C in 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation, the reaction mixture was added to 2 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 100 μl of 10% SDS, followed by measurement of the fluorescence of the cleavage products using a Hitachi Model F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The fluorescent cleavage products of succinyl-LLVY-MCA and t-butoxycarbonyl-LSTR-MCA were detected at an emission wavelength of 460 nm and an excitation wavelength of 380 nm, and the fluorescent group of benzyloxycarbonyl-LLE-β-nitroanilide was detected at an emission wavelength of 410 nm and an excitation wavelength of 335 nm.The proteasome activity was also evaluated using RL34 cells stably transfected with the Proteasome Sensor Vector™ (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The ZsProSensor™ protein accumulated through the inhibition of the proteasome (resulting in a strong green emission signal) was measured using a Coulter® Epics XL™ flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc.).Western Blot Analysis—The homogenates prepared from the cells were treated with SDS sample buffer and immediately boiled for 5 min. The protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Twenty μg of the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). To detect the immunoreactive proteins, we used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and ECL blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and spectrophotometrically quantified. Total RNAs (5 μg) were reverse-transcribed into cDNA and used for RT-PCR analysis (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal standard. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel, and the positive signals were quantified by densitometry analysis after staining with ethidium bromide.Luciferase Assay—We used a promoterless luciferase plasmid vector (pGVB; Nippon Gene Co., Ltd., Toyama, Japan) with the minimal promoter sequence of the rat GST P1 gene (-50 to +37 bp) containing a GC box and a TATA box (22Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A 3.0-kb fragment between -2.5 kb and +59 bp of the gene for GST P1 was inserted into the SacI-HindIII site of the plasmid vector and designated -2.5GST. A series of 5′-deletion mutants were constructed from -2.5GST using the appropriate restriction enzymes. The following sequences were also utilized for the reporter transfection assay: GPE1, 5′-GTCAGTCACTATGATTCAGCAAC-3′; and two mutated forms of GPE1 (with the mutated positions underlined), 5′-GTCAGTCACTACGATTCAGCAAC-3′ (mGPE1) and 5′-GTCAGTCGCTATGATTCAGCAAC-3′ (mmGPE1). These were prepared as described previously (23Ikeda H. Serria M.S. Kakizaki I. Hatayama I. Satoh K. Tsuchida S. Muramatsu M. Nishi S. Sakai M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For the reporter transfection assay, RL34 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and seeded at 4 × 104 cells/well in 6-well dishes 2-18 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor (0.5 μm). After 24 h, a luciferase assay was performed using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) following the supplier's protocol, followed by measurement using a mini Lumar LB9560 (Berthold Technologies GmbH, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Transfection efficiencies were routinely normalized by the activity of cotransfected Renilla luciferase (5 μg). Normally, three independent experiments were performed (each carried out in duplicate), and the means ± S.E. are presented.Transient Transfection of Nrf2—Mouse full-length Nrf2 cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). An expression vector for mutant Nrf2 lacking both the Neh4 and Neh5 domains (required for the transactivation activity of Nrf2) was created by site-directed mutagenesis. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000™ according to the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000™ were each diluted with 250 μl of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). After 5 min at room temperature, they were combined and incubated for 20 min. Reaction mixtures were overlaid on the cell culture for 6 h. The medium was then changed to fresh medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, maintained for another 24 h, and subjected to the experiment.Stable Transfection with the Wild-type and Dominant-negative Forms of Keap1 in RL34 Cells—Mouse full-length Keap1 cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Mutant keap1 genes containing alanine codons substituted for specific cysteine codons were constructed. In the experiments reported here, we focused our attention on two cysteine residues within the N-terminal region of Keap1 (Cys23 and Cys38), seven cysteine residues within the intervening region (Cys226, Cys241, Cys249, Cys257, Cys273, Cys288, and Cys297), one cysteine residue within the double glycine repeat (Cys319), and three cysteine residues within the C-terminal region (Cys613, Cys622, and Cys624). The four cysteine residues within the intervening region of Keap1 (Cys257, Cys273, Cys288, and Cys297) were selected on the basis of a recent report that these cysteine residues preferentially react with thiol-specific chemicals in vitro (24Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000™ according to the manufacturer's protocols. In these experiments, 1 × 106 RL34 cells were incubated with DNA transfection reagent mixture (2 μg of DNA/4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000™) in 0.5 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM I at 37 °C. After 6 h of incubation, 1 ml of the complete medium was added, and the cells were cultured for 18 h. Thereafter, stable transfectants were isolated by culture in selection medium containing 700 μg/ml G418 for ∼3 weeks. A single clone of the stably transfected cells was isolated and expanded. Several G418-resistant stable clones were maintained in regular growth medium containing 700 μg/ml G418.RNA Interference (RNAi) Using siRNA—The following siRNAs were generated by Invitrogen: rat proteasome β5 subunit nucleotides 480-504, 5′-GCACCAUGAUCUGUGGCUGGGAUAA-3′; rat proteasome Rpn2, 5′-AAUUUGGCCCAGUUAGUGGCUCUGG-3′; and rat Nrf2 nucleotides 465-489, 5′-AAUAUCCAGGGCAAGCGACUCAUGG-3′. As a control, we used Stealth™ RNAi negative control duplexes (Invitrogen). RL34 cells were seeded at 80% density the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000™; 2.5 μl of siRNA stock (20 μm) and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000™ were each diluted with 250 μl of Opti-MEM I. After 5 min at room temperature, they were combined and incubated for 20 min. The reaction mixtures were overlaid on the cell culture for 6 h. The medium was then changed to fresh medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum.RESULTSSelective Induction of GST P1 by Proteasome Inhibitors—Our results showed that phase 2 enzyme inducers, including a sulforaphane analog (6-HITC), gave rise to significant downregulation of proteasome activities and the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Supplemental Fig. S1). This and the previous findings that the phase 2-inducible electrophilic aldehydes and ketones are inhibitors of the proteasome (25Fukuda A. Nakamura Y. Ohigashi H. Osawa T. Uchida K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Kawamoto Y. Nakamura Y. Naito Y. Torii Y. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Ohigashi H. Satoh K. Imagawa M. Uchida K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13960-13968Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) led us to the assumption that proteasome down-regulation might be associated with the induction of phase 2 detoxification enzymes. Hence, to explore the role of the proteasome in the phase 2 response, we examined whether well established proteasome inhibitors such as MG132, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, and lactacystin could induce GST isozymes. As shown in Fig. 1, these inhibitors hardly induced the class Alpha GST isozymes such as GST A1, GST A4, and GST A5, whereas they significantly induced class Pi GST P1 (Fig. 1, A-C). In addition, RT-PCR analysis also demonstrated the selective up-regulation of GST P1 gene expression in cells treated with clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Fig. 2). These data suggest that proteasome inhibition may result in the selective induction of GST P1 gene expression.Fig. 2Effect of a proteasome inhibitor on the induction of phase 2 detoxification enzymes in RL34 cells. Left panel, induction of phase 2 detoxification enzymes by clasto-lactacystin β-lactone. The cells were treated with 1 μm clasto-lactacystin β-lactone for different time intervals as indicated.

As shown in Fig. 3A, the proteasome C2 subunit antisense oligonucleotide treatment resulted in a modest decline in the chymotrypsin, trypsin, and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities of the proteasome. In addition, the antisense oligonucleotide-induced down-regulation of the proteasome was also confirmed by a fluorescent reporter assay for proteasome activity using the Proteasome Sensor Vector™ (Fig. 3B). We evaluated the functional impact of proteasome dysfunction on the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in response to antisense oligonucleotide treatment and observed that the steady-state level of ubiquitinated proteins was higher in the antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells than in the control cells (Fig. 3C). A significant increase in the levels of GST P1 was observed, accompanied by a significant decline in the proteasome activities and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3D). Thus, the level of proteasome inhibition observed in the cells seemed to be inversely correlated with the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and the induction of GST P1.Fig. 3Effect of the proteasome C2 subunit antisense oligonucleotide on the induction of GST P1. RL34 cells were transfected the sense (S) and antisense (AS) oligonucleotides for 6 h. A, effect of the proteasome C2 subunit antisense oligonucleotide on proteasome activity.

We selected two representative subunits of the 26 S proteasome as targets for RNAi: one 20 S proteasome subunit (β5) and one 19 S proteasome subunit (Rpn2). As shown in Fig. 4(A and B), the siRNA of the proteasome β5 subunit resulted in corresponding changes in the proteasome activities. The reduced expression of the proteasome subunit promoted increased expression of GST P1 (Fig. 4C). Similar results were also obtained with the siRNA of the proteasome subunit Rpn2 (Fig. 5). These results establish that a decline in the proteasome activity could be directly or indirectly linked to an increase in the levels of GST P1 mRNA.Fig. 4RNAi of the 20 S proteasome β5 subunit induces GST P1. A, changes in proteasome activity in RL34 cells subjected to siRNA of the proteasome β5 subunit.

Here we have identified an Rrm3p interaction protein known to be Def1p. In def1 mutants, telomeres were ∼200-bp shorter than that in wild-type cells. DEF1 is also required for the stable maintenance of mitochondrial DNA, and the telomere shortening phenotype seen in def1 cells is not a secondary consequence of the mitochondrion defect. A combination of DEF1 null mutation with deletion of EST2 or EST3 resulted in an accelerated senescence phenotype, suggesting that Def1p is not involved in the telomerase recruitment pathway. In the absence of telomerase, cells escape senescence by either amplifying Y′ regions or TG-telomeric repeats to generate type I or type II survivors, respectively. Only type I survivors were recovered from both def1Δ est2Δ and def1Δ est3Δ double mutant cells, further suggesting that the function of Def1p in telomere maintenance is specific. Our novel findings of the functions of Def1p in telomere and mitochondria suggested that Def1p plays multiple roles in yeast.

Telomeres are the physical ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that are composed of specific repeat DNA sequences and binding proteins (1Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The telomeres mainly serve three functions. First, the telomere protects chromosome both from degradation and from fusion with other ends (2de Lange T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Second, in most eukaryotes, it facilitates the complete replication of chromosomes through telomerase, a special reverse transcriptase using Tlc1 as the RNA template, or homologous recombination, which is RAD52-dependent (1Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 4Kass-Eisler A. Greider C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). However, Drosophila has an unusual telomere elongation mechanism. Long retrotransposons (HeT-A and TART) transpose to the ends of chromosomes instead of short repeats, which are synthesized by telomerase (6Pardue M.L. DeBaryshe P.G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 485-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Third, the telomere forms a heterochromatic regions that represses the subtelomeric genes, at least in some species (7Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, each end of every chromosome bears ∼300 ± 75 bp of C1-3A/TG1-3 telomeric DNA. In addition to the TG1-3 tracts, yeast chromosomes have telomere associated repeats called X and Y′ (8Chan C.S. Tye B.K. Cell. 1983; 33: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the telomere integrity is maintained through both telomere elongation/shortening and telomere end capping activities (9Blackburn E.H. Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 10Cervantes R.B. Lundblad V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Many factors that function in telomeres contribute to both telomere replication and capping processes. Telomerase, a specialized reverse transcriptase that is comprised of several subunits including Est1p, Est2p (catalytic subunit), Est3p, and Tlc1 (the RNA template), is responsible for the elongation of TG1-3 tracts (11Lendvay T.S. Morris D.K. Sah J. Balasubramanian B. Lundblad V. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1399-1412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Singer M.S. Gottschling D.E.

Disrupting any of them will cause progressive telomere shortening and eventually cellular senescence, although only the catalytic subunit Est2p and the RNA subunit Tlc1 are required for the in vitro telomerase activity (14Lingner J. Cech T.R. Hughes T.R. Lundblad V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11190-11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Besides its function on telomeric DNA elongation, the telomerase also contributes to telomere capping (16Prescott J.C. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another key regulator of telomere homeostasis is the Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 complex, which is involved in both telomere length regulation and telomere end protection. The cdc13-1, stn1-13 and ten1-31 mutants showed telomere length change and accumulation of single-stranded G-rich overhang of telomeric regions when incubated at a 36 °C-restrictive temperature (17Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 18Grandin N. Damon C. Charbonneau M. Mol. Cell.

The biochemical characterization of Cdc13p showed that it binds telomeric single-stranded G-rich DNA with extremely high affinity (20Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 21Lin J.J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13760-13765Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The in vivo cross-linking experiments demonstrated that Cdc13p binds telomeres (22Taggart A.K. Teng S.C. Zakian V.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Cdc13p is bound to the single-stranded G-rich overhang in vivo. The Rap1 protein, which binds with high affinity to specific sequences within the telomeric TG1-3 tracts (23Conrad M.N. Wright J.H. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), is a major positive regulator. Mutation of Rap1p, as well as its associate proteins Rif1p and Rif2p, leads to telomere elongation (24Hardy C.F. Sussel L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 25Wotton D. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The Tel1p and Mec1p, two ATM-like protein kinases are checkpoint regulators (26Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6065-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Disrupting one of them results in stable shortened telomeres, double deletion causes the progressive shortening of telomeres and cell senescence (28Ritchie K.B. Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6065-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and the double mutating of mec1tel1 ultimately results in gross chromosomal rearrangements. The yKu70/80 heterodimer not only positively regulates telomere length, but also plays a protective role on telomeres. yKu mutant strains display short but stable telomeres (29Porter S.E. Greenwell P.W. Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and the single-stranded telomeric G-rich strand, usually restricted to S phase in wild-type cells, is present in yku cells throughout the cell cycle (31Gravel S.

Recently, we found that the Pif1 subfamily helicases, including Pif1p and Rrm3p in S. cerevisiae and Pfh1p in Schizosac-charomyces pombe, all affect telomeres (32Schulz V.P. Zakian V.A.

The deletion of the PIF1 gene causes mitochondrial defect and telomere elongation (36Foury F. Kolodynski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 37Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Zakian V.A.

Science. 2000; 289: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Besides its telomere function, the Pif1p is also required for the stable maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (36Foury F. Kolodynski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Rrm3p is another member of Pif1 helicase subfamily in S. cerevisiae. Loss of Rrm3p resulted in very modest telomere lengthening, which is likely due to the replication defect in the telomere regions, because the replication fork pausing at both telomeric and subtelomeric DNA was observed in rrm3 cells (34Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Schulz V.P. Monson E.K. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1383-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The S. pombe Pfh1p, a 5′-3′ DNA helicase, shares high identity to Saccharomyces Pif1p (35Zhou J.Q. Qi H. Schulz V.P. Mateyak M.K. Monson E.K. Zakian V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2180-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Unlike the two S. cerevisiae Pif1 subfamily proteins, the S. pombe Pfh1p was essential. Telomeric DNA was modestly shortened in the absence of Pfh1p (35Zhou J.Q. Qi H. Schulz V.P. Mateyak M.K. Monson E.K. Zakian V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2180-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this paper, we performed an affinity chromatography experiment by using 13myc-tagged Rrm3p as bait to isolate proteins that interact with Rrm3p. One of the proteins that interacts with Rrm3p is Def1p, which was reported to be required for degradation of RNA polymerase II in the DNA damage response (38Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Here, we mainly show the novel functions of Def1p in telomeres. Our genetic and biochemical data suggest that Def1p is involved in telomere length regulation. Yeast Strains, Media, and Plasmids—Unless otherwise noted, all S. cerevisiae deletion strains were of YPH499 and YPH500 background (39Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myc-tagged Rrm3p is of VPS106 background (32Schulz V.P. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 145-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The rrm3 allele was a deletion of the RRM3 open reading frame (by HIS3 in pRS303) made by using inverse PCR, the same method was used for the deletion of the open reading frames of DST1 (by HIS3 in pRS303), RAD26 (by LEU2 in pRS305), DEF1 (by TRP1 in pRS304), SNF5 (by HIS3 in pRS303), EST3 (by HIS3 in pRS303), and EST2 (by HIS3 in pRS303). Unless otherwise stated, all strains were grown at 30 °C and on YPDA media (adenine-supplemented YDP-10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 2% dextrose). The knock-out strains were selected on the synthetic glucose (SD) medium with different nutritional requirements. pDEF1 was constructed by cloning a 3.3-kb (-1,000 to +100) BamHI-XhoI PCR-amplified fragment of DEF1 in the BamHI-XhoI site of pRS316 (39Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity Purification and Identification of Rrm3p Interaction Proteins—12 liters of either wild-type (YPH499) rrm3 or RRM3-13myc cells (originally provided by Dr. Zakian's laboratory in Princeton University) were grown at 30 °C until the A600 reached 1.0 and collected, and the cells were resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA at pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted by two passages through a homogenizer (EmulsiFlex-C5, AVESTIN). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1h). Approximately 7-8 ml (with 10-15 mg/ml protein concentration) of each supernatant was passed through a 1-ml protein G-Sepharose column cross-linked with ∼ 2 mg of antimyc monoclonal antibodies, washed with 20 ml of PBS, 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MS, mass spectrometry; aa, amino acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TPE, telomere position effect. and eluted with 500 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 0.2% SDS). The eluates were analyzed by both Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. For enzymatic digestion, the protein sample was then incubated with trypsin (50:1) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The digested sample was ultrafiltrated using 10K ultrafiltration membrane (microcon), and lyophilized for one-dimensional liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Chromatography was performed using a surveyor LC system (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) on C18 reverse phase column (180 μm × 150 mm, BioBasic® C18, 5 μm, Thermo Hypersil-Keystone), and the acquired MS/MS spectra were automatically searched against the protein data base for yeast proteins (NCBI 12/19/2001) using the TurboSEQUEST program in the BioWorks™ 3.0 software suite. Co-immunoprecipitation—1 liter of yeast cells were grown at 30 °C until the A600 reached 1.0. Cells were collected and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA at pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and disrupted by two passages through a homogenizer (EmulsiFlex-C5, AVESTIN). Soluble proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. 500 μl of supernatants (with 15-20 mg/ml protein concentration) were incubated with mouse anti-myc monoclonal (Sigma), affinity-purified rabbit anti-Rrm3p polyclonal or affinity-purified chicken anti-Def1p polyclonal antibodies at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The incubation was continued with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. After washing the beads with PBS 3 times, the beads were boiled, and the samples were analyzed with Western blot. Telomere Blot—Genomic DNA prepared from saturated cultures was digested by XhoI, separated on a 0.9% gel, transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to a poly(GT) telomere-specific probe as described previously (33Zhou J. Monson E.K. Teng S. Schulz V.P. Zakian V.A. Science. 2000; 289: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Growth Ability Assay—We inactivated the DEF1 gene in both est2Δ and est3Δ mutant cells. For the serial dilution plate assay, the wild-type, est2Δ, est3Δ, def1Δ, def1Δ est2Δ, and def1Δ est3Δ colonies were resuspended in 200 μl of water; 3 μl of each 10-fold serial dilution were plated on the YPDA plate and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. At the same time when we were performing the serial dilution plate assay, cell viability in culture experiment was performed according the standard methods described before (40Le S. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Greider C.W. Genetics. 1999; 152: 143-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Rizki A. Lundblad V. Nature. 2001; 411: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Each colony was inoculated into 5 ml of YPDA liquid culture and grown to saturation (108 cells/ml) at 30 °C. Each day was diluted to a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in fresh YPDA medium, and the cell numbers were determined 24 h later by hemocytometer. This cycle was continued for 15-16 days and was repeated three times. At each dilution point, cells were examined for possible contamination and stored for telomere Southern blot. And the single-colony streak assay was performed according to the standard protocol described by Greider and co-workers (42Chen Q. Ijpma A. Greider C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1819-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Recombinant Protein Purification, Gel Shift Assay, and Gel Filtration—The DNA fragments, which encode for the truncated Def1p-N (aa 1-207) and Def1p-M (aa 350-586), were PCR-amplified from YPH499 genomic DNA and inserted at the EcoRI-XhoI site of pGEX-4T-1 vector. The GST fusion proteins were overexpressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified recombinant proteins were analyzed with Coomassie Blue staining, and aliquotted for gel shift assay. The Gel Shift Assay—Single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized and two complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to form double-stranded DNA, and the substrates were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions. The binding reaction mixture (20-μl volume) contained 25 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of sperm single-stranded DNA, 1 μg of poly(dC-dI) and the indicated amounts of proteins. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and run in a 0.5× TBE buffer. The gel was dried on Whatman paper and imaged with a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Gel Filtration—500 μg of purified Def1p-Q (aa 381-480) in 100 μl of PBS was loaded on an analytical Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was calibrated according to the vendor's protocol with protein standard markers including bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), Chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). The column was developed with PBS at 0.3 ml min-1, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The elution profile was analyzed by Western blot. Identification of Def1p—To study how telomere replication by conventional replication machinery and telomere elongation by telomerase are connected, an affinity purification of the proteins that interact with Rrm3p was carried out because Rrm3p promotes the replication fork progression through both telomeric and subtelomeric DNA (34Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Schulz V.P. Monson E.K. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1383-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The RRM3 gene was tagged with 13myc epitope, and the yeast whole-cell extract was derived from a strain expressing 13myc-tagged RRM3 (RRM3-13myc) was loaded on an anti-myc monoclonal antibody column. The proteins (or protein complexes) bound to the column were eluted as described under “Materials and Methods.” The eluate was analyzed by the one-dimensional liquid chromatography-MS/MS approach of mass spectrometric sequencing to identify the Rrm3p interaction proteins (see “Materials and Methods”). We found that 25 proteins were shown in the RRM3-13myc sample, but not in the RRM3 deletion and wild-type samples (data not shown). One of the proteins was called Rip1p (Rrm3 interaction protein 1). However, during the course of our study, Woudstra et al. (38Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) identified a protein Def1p (RNAPII degradation factor 1) and named it after its cellular function, because Def1p is required for degradation of RNA polymerase II in the DNA damage response. Both Rip1p and Def1p are encoded by one open reading frame with the standard name of YKL054C in the Saccharomyces genome data base (Chr XI, coordinates 338398-336182). Although we identified the same protein independently, in this paper DEF1 (or Def1) instead of RIP1 (Rip1) is used. The DEF1 gene encodes a 738-amino-acid polypeptide with a theoretical and practical molecular mass of 84 and 120 kilodaltons in SDS-PAGE, respectively (38Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction between Rrm3p and Def1p, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with both anti-myc and affinity-purified anti-Def1p antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot with primary antibodies against Def1p and Rrm3p, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, Def1p was detected in the Rrm3-13myc immunoprecipitates with anti-Def1p antibodies but not from the rrm3 or def1 cells (Fig. 1A); however, we also detect the band that migrates slower than Def1p in the lane marked RRM3-13myc, we thought that it might be a nonspecific protein, which is co-precipitated by myc antibody together with RRM3-13myc complex. Reciprocally, Rrm3p was co-immunoprecipitated with Def1p from the wild-type cells but not from the rrm3 or def1 cells (Fig. 1B). The results from both the affinity chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis and the co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that Def1p interacts with Rrm3p. Disruption of DEF1 Results in Telomere Shortening—Before we identified the Def1 function in the telomere, we firstly performed the telomere Southern blot to detect whether the myc-tagged Rrm3p could complement its function in telomeres in vivo. The genomic DNA from wild-type and RRM3-13myc cells were digested with XhoI, and the telomere length was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using a specific TG1-3/C1-3A telomeric probe. As shown in Fig. 2A (left panel), the restriction enzyme XhoI cuts yeast DNA in the subtelomeric Y′ repeat, generating a terminal restriction fragment in wild-type cells of ∼1.3 kb, ∼350 bp of which represents the terminal polyTG1-3/C1-3A tracts. Tagging the RRM3 gene with 13myc has no effect on telomere length, suggesting that Rrm3-13myc could function properly in telomeres. Because Rrm3p has been shown to promote the replication fork progression through subtelomeric and telomeric DNA, and inactivation of Rrm3p has very modest effect on telomere length (34Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Schulz V.P. Monson E.K. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1383-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we wanted to know whether DEF1 has any effect on telomere length regulation. As shown in Fig. 2A (right panel), loss of Def1p resulted in ∼1.1 kb of the Y′ telomeric restriction fragments, i.e. ∼200-bp shortening of telomeric DNA, in the extensive subcultured cells (∼100 generations) (Fig. 2A, right panel). The X telomeres also shortened in response to the def1 mutation (Fig. 2A, right panel). The shortened telomeres were also detected in another strain W303-1A with the deletion of DEF1 (data not shown), suggesting that the positive regulation of Def1p on telomere length is general in S. cerevisiae. Def1p has been reported to interact with Rad26p, which is the S. cerevisiae functional homologue of the Cockayne syndromes B gene (CSB/ERCC6) product and belongs to Swi/Snf-like DNA-dependent ATPase (38Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 43Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18314-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and Def1p shares similarity with Snf5p (comprehensive yeast genome data base). Therefore, a possible explanation for the effect of Def1p on telomeres is that Rad26, as well as other SWI/SNF family members, may be involved in telomere maintenance. Def1p has been shown to play a role in the ubiquitinylation and degradation of RNA polymerase II (38Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and thus, it is possible that the telomere shortening seen in the def1 cells results from the effect of RNA polymerase II defect. To address these issues, we made several deletion mutants of snf5, rad26, and dst1. DST1 encodes the elongation factor TFIIS, which promotes the readthrough of blocks to elongation by RNA polymerase II (44Davie J.K. Kane C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5960-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The telomere length in snf5, rad26, and dst1 cells was analyzed, and the results are shown in Fig. 2B (wild-type, dst1, rad26, and snf5) indicated that disruption of either RAD26, SNF5, or DST1 has little effect on telomere length regulation. Because DEF1 affects the degradation of RNA polymerase II through ubiquitinylation (38Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), it is possible that deletion of DEF1 affects the transcription or degradation of telomere-binding proteins, e.g. yKu complex, and the telomere phenotype of def1 cells is a secondary consequence. We then examined the level of yKu70 and Rap1p, in both wild-type and def1 cells and did not find any differences by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C and data not shown), suggesting that telomere shortening of def1 cells was not likely because of the down- or up-regulation of yKu, or Rap1p resulted from a transcription or degradation defect. These data suggest that the function of Def1p in telomeres is separable from its function in other aspects such as DNA repair and RNA polymerase II degradation (38Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The Slow Growth of def1 Cells Is Not Likely because of Telomere Shortening—The def1 cells also showed slow growth phenotype as previously reported by Woudstra et al. (38Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We noticed that the colony morphology of the def1 and wild-type were very different (data not shown), and extensive restreaks of def1 cells gave rise to smaller colonies. We suspected that the slow growth defect of def1 cells was because of the telomere shortening; however, the slow growth phenotype is not common in the mutations of many other genes that affect telomere replication. The appearance of little colonies of def1 cells reflects the “petite” phenotype as in the cells with a mutation in PIF1 gene, caused by the defective maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (36Foury F. Kolodynski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The yeast cells with certain defect of mitochondria cannot grow on a non-fermentable carbon source such as glycerol. We then examined the growth ability of the def1 cells on a glycerol plate in which the non-fermentable glycerol was the only carbon source, and the results are shown in Fig. 3A. Like the pif1 cells, the def1 cells did not grow to form colonies on the glycerol plate. To detect whether the def1 cells are devoid of mitochondrial DNA, we stained the def1 cells with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The typical image under the fluorescent microscope is shown in Fig. 3B. The punctate staining of mitochondrial DNA seen in the cytoplasmic regions in the wild-type cells disappeared mostly in the def1 cells. Therefore, the slow growth of def1 cells was likely because of the mitochondrial defect. The fact that def1 cells showed the mitochondrial defect led us to suspect that the telomere shortening seen in the def1 cells might be the secondary effect of the mitochondrial defect. Therefore, we introduced a CEN plasmid (pRS316) carrying the DEF1 gene into the def1 strain, as shown in Fig. 2A (lanes marked with pDEF1), the shorte"

In this work, we generated site-directed mutants that possess a strongly broadened activity spectrum when compared with the WT CphA. Strikingly, the N116H/N220G double mutant exhibits a substrate profile close to that observed for the broad spectrum subclass B1 enzymes. The double mutant is significantly activated by the binding of a second zinc ion under conditions where the WT enzyme is non-competitively inhibited by the same ion. Among class B β-lactamases, the subclass B2 CphA enzyme is characterized by a unique specificity profile. CphA efficiently hydrolyzes only carbapenems. In this work, we generated site-directed mutants that possess a strongly broadened activity spectrum when compared with the WT CphA. Strikingly, the N116H/N220G double mutant exhibits a substrate profile close to that observed for the broad spectrum subclass B1 enzymes. The double mutant is significantly activated by the binding of a second zinc ion under conditions where the WT enzyme is non-competitively inhibited by the same ion. In vivo, class B β-lactamases (1.Ambler R.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1980; 289: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar) require one or two zinc ions as enzymatic cofactors. By efficiently catalyzing the hydrolysis of the β-lactam amide bond, these enzymes play a key role in bacterial resistance to this group of antibiotics. The metallo-β-lactamase family has been divided into three different subclasses, B1, B2, and B3, on the basis of sequence similarities (2.Galleni M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Rossolini G.M. Spencer J.

Mercuri P.S. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 2347-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The CphA metallo-β-lactamase produced by Aeromonas hydrophila belongs to subclass B2. It is characterized by a uniquely narrow specificity profile. CphA efficiently hydrolyzes only carbapenems and shows very poor activity against penicillins and cephalosporins, a behavior in contrast to that of metallo-β-lactamases of subclasses B1 and B3, which usually exhibit very broad activity spectra against nearly all β-lactam compounds, with the exception of monobactams (4.Segatore B.

Joris B. Fanuel L. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to the BcII (Bacillus cereus) and CcrA (Bacteroides fragilis) enzymes belonging to the B1 subclass, and in general to most other metallo-β-lactamases, CphA exhibits a maximum activity as a mono-zinc enzyme. The presence of a Zn2+ ion in a second low affinity binding site non-competitively inhibits the enzyme with a Ki value of 46 μm at pH 6.5 (6.Hernandez-Valladares M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W.

In the di-zinc form of subclass B1, the zinc ions occupy both the His116, His118, and His196 and the Asp120, Cys221, and His263 sites (see Fig. 1). The histidine residue in position 116 in most metallo-β-lactamases is replaced by an asparagine residue in CphA (2.Galleni M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Rossolini G.M. Spencer J. Dideberg O.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4611-4617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Asn-116 residue is not responsible for the narrow substrate profile of CphA, because the activity of the N116H mutant (where the three-histidine site found in most metallo-β-lactamases is recreated) against nitrocefin, benzyl-penicillin, and cephaloridine, although increased, remains rather low (16.Vanhove M.

Moreover, the KD2 values are similar for the N116S mutant and the wild-type enzyme, indicating that Asn116 does not participate in the binding of the second metal ion. Among the strictly conserved residues (Table I), Arg121 is also present in most subclass B1 enzymes, with the exception of CcrA and IMP-1 where the arginine is replaced by a cysteine and a serine, respectively. In subclass B3, position 121 is occupied by a histidine residue that becomes a ligand for the second zinc ion (12.Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J.

In subclass B3, cysteine 221 is replaced by a serine, which does not interact directly with the second zinc ion but with a water molecule located in the active site and may serve as a proton donor during the catalytic process (12.Ullah J.H.

The analysis of Fig. 1 and Table I indicated that we could progressively, by site-directed mutagenesis, replace the metal binding site motif of subclass B2 metallo-β-lactamase (Asn116-X-His118-X-Asp120... His196... Gly219-Asn220-Cys221... His263) by those of subclass B1 (His116-X-His118-X-Asp120... His196... Gly219-Gly220-Cys221... His263) or subclass B3 (His116-X-His118-X-Asp120-His121..His196... His263), respectively. These mutations strikingly broadened the CphA activity spectrum. Some mutants efficiently catalyzed the hydrolysis of penicillins and cephalosporins in addition to carbapenems. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce all the mutations. The primers designed for these experiments are listed in Table II. The N220G mutant was constructed using pET9a/CphA WT as template. The double mutant N116H/N220G was constructed using pET9a/CphA N220G as template. Triple mutants N116H/R121H/N220G and N116H/N220G/C221S were constructed from the N116H/N220G mutant. The quadruple mutant N116H/R121H/N220G/C221S was made by adding mutation C221S to the N116H/R121H/N220G triple mutant. Finally, the triple mutant N116H/R121H/C221S was obtained from the quadruple mutant by replacing Gly220 by the asparagine residue found in the wild-type enzyme.Table IIList of mutagenic primers used to generate mutantsPrimersaFor, forward primer; Rev: reverse primer.SequencesN116Hfor5′-CTGGAGGTGATCAACACCCACTACCACACCGACCG-3′N116Hrev5′-CGGTCGGTGTGGTAGTGGGTGTTGATCACCTCCAG-3′N220Gfor5′-CGAGCAGGTGCTCTATGGCGGCTGCATTCTCAAGGAG-3′N220Grev5′-CTCCTTGAGAATGCAGCCGCCATAGAGCACCTGCTCG-3′R121Hfor5′-CAACTACCACACCGACCACGCTGGCGGTAACGCC-3′R121Hrev5′-GGCGTTACCGCCAGCGTGGTCGGTGTGGTAGTTG-3′TmR121Hfor5′-CCACTACCACACCGACCACGCTGGCGGTAACGCC-3′TmR121Hrev5′-GGCGTTACCGCCAGCGTGGTCGGTGTGGTAGTGG-3′TmC221Sfor5′-GGTCCTCTATGGCGGCAGCATTCTCAAGGAGAAGC-3′TmC221Srev5′-GCTTCTCCTTGAGAATGCTGCCGCCATAGAGGACC-3′G220Nfor5′-CGAGCAGGTGCTCTATGGCAACAGCATTCTCAAGGAG-3′G220Nrev5′-CTCCTTGAGAATGCTGTTGCCATAGAGCACCTGCTCG-3′a For, forward primer; Rev: reverse primer. Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification—The genes encoding wild-type CphA and the mutant proteins were cloned into pET9a using the BamHI and NdeI restriction sites. The different vectors were then introduced into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS Star (Invitrogen). Overexpression and purification of the mutant proteins were performed as described for the wild-type protein (6.Hernandez-Valladares M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M.

Bacteria expressing the wild-type protein were grown for 8 h at 37 °C in 2XYT medium (Oxoïd, Backingstoke, UK), whereas those expressing the mutants were grown for 30 h at 18 °C in the same medium. The temperature was decreased to 18 °C because all the mutant proteins were produced mainly in a non-soluble form when the cultures were grown at 37 °C. The N116H/R121H/N220G/C221S mutant could never be produced in a soluble form even at 18 °C. The N116H/N220G/C221S and N116H/R121H/C221S mutants turned out to be very unstable and could not be purified in sufficient quantities for detailed characterization. Determination of Kinetic Parameters—The hydrolysis of the antibiotics was monitored by following the absorbance variation resulting from the opening of the β-lactam ring, using a Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer equipped with thermostatically controlled cells and connected to a microcomputer via an RS232C serial interface. The wavelength and absorbance variations were those described by Matagne et al. (20.Matagne A. Misselyn-Bauduin A.M. Joris B. Th Erpicum Granier B. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21.Matagne A. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Frère J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells with 0.2- to 1-cm path lengths were used, depending on the substrate concentrations. When the Km values of the studied enzymes were sufficiently high, the kcat and Km parameters were determined either under initial-rate conditions, using the Hanes linearization of the Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation, or by analyzing the complete hydrolysis time courses (22.De Meester F. Joris B. Reckinger G. Bellefroid-Bourguignon C. Frère J.M. Waley S.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Low and very high Km values were determined as Ki values using imipenem or nitrocefin as reporter substrates. In the cases of low Km values, the kcat values were obtained from the initial hydrolysis rates measured at saturating substrate concentrations, and in the cases of high Km values, kcat was directly derived from the kcat/Km ratio. All experiments were performed at 30 °C in 15 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5. Imipenem was from Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories (Rahway, NJ); benzylpenicillin, oxacillin, cephaloridine, and cefotaxime were from Sigma; and nitrocefin was from Unipath Oxoid (Basingstoke, UK). Enzymatic Measurement in the Presence of Increasing Concentrations of Zinc and Determination of KD2 —Apparent kcat and Km values were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of zinc at 30 °C in 15 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. When binding of the second zinc ion resulted in a complete loss of activity, the data were analyzed Equation 1 (6.Hernandez-Valladares M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), kcat/kcat(0)=[kD2/([Zn]+KD2)](Eq. 1) where kcat/kcat(0) is the ratio between kcat in the presence of zinc and kcat in the absence of added zinc, and KD2 is the dissociation constant for the second zinc ion. When binding of the second zinc ion resulted in an incomplete loss of activity or in an increase of activity, Equation 2 was used (16.Vanhove M. Zakhem M. Devreese B. Franceschini N. Anne C. Bebrone C. Amicosante G. Rossolini G.M. Van Beeumen J. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2501-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), kcat/kcat(0)=[(kD2+α[Zn])/([Zn]+KD2)](Eq. 2) where α represents the ratio of kcat at saturating zinc concentration over kcat in the absence of added zinc. Experimental data were fitted to Equations 1 or 2 by non-linear regression analysis with the help of KaleidaGraph for Windows (KaleidaGraph™, version 3.5, Synergy Software). Electron Spray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry and Metal Content Determination—Samples of wild-type and mutant CphA enzymes were equilibrated in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) by centrifugal filtration prior to electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry. For each protein mass spectra were obtained under both denaturing and native conditions. Denaturation of the protein was performed by dilution of the protein in a 50:50 (v/v) water/acetonitrile mixture containing 0.1% formic acid to final concentrations of 2–5 pmol/μl. The native protein was diluted to 10–15 pmol/μl in 10 mm ammonium acetate. All mass spectra were acquired on a Q-TOF1 mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK) equipped with a nanoelectron spray ionization source using gold/lead-coated borosilicate needles purchased from Protana (Odense, Denmark). Capillary voltage was set at 1250 V and cone voltage at 40 and 60 V for the denatured protein and native protein, respectively. Acquisition time was 3–5 min across an m/z range of 400–3000. The mass spectra were processed with MassLynx version 3.1 software of Micromass. The instrument was calibrated using a mixture of myoglobin and trypsinogen. The zinc content of each protein was derived from the mass difference between the native and denatured protein. Determination of the Zinc Content Using ICP/MS—Proteins samples were dialyzed against 15 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. Protein concentrations were then determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 38,000 m–1cm–1). Zinc contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy as previously described (6.Hernandez-Valladares M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M.

Stability toward Chaotropic Agents—The stability of the different proteins was studied by fluorescence. The WT and mutant enzymes (0.05 mg/ml) were incubated for 16 h in the presence of increasing urea concentrations (0–8 m) at 4 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra of the enzymes were recorded at 20 °C with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 333 nm, respectively. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra of the different enzymes (0.5 mg/ml) were obtained using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. The spectra were scanned at 20 °C with 1-nm steps from 200 to 250 nm (far UV) and from 250 to 310 nm (near UV). From a B2 to a B1 Enzyme—The N220G and N116H/N220G mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS Star and purified to homogeneity. The mass of the different proteins was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. Within experimental errors, the mutants were found to exhibit the expected masses (25132.92 versus 25132 Da for N220G and 25154.34 versus 25155 for N116H/N220G, Table III).Table IIIMetal binding for wild-type CphA and mutantsProteinAssay conditionsElectrospray ionization-mass spectrometryICP/MS Zn2+ contentMass of proteinCalculatedMeasuredNo. of Zn2+ ionsDaCphA WTNative25,253.5311Denatured25,18925,189.62N116HNative25,274.4711Denatured25,21225,212.27N220GNative25,196.7111Denatured25,13225,132.92N116H/N220GNative25,218.7711Denatured25,15525,154.34R121HNative25,232.5 (40%)12 (expected: 1.6)25,294.5 (60%)2Denatured25,16925,169.28N116H/R121H/N220GNative25,198.32 (60%)11.7 (expected: 1.4)25,262.37 (40%)2Denatured25,13625,135.68 Open table in a new tab The CD spectra of the mutants in the far UV indicated the same α/β ratio as for the wild-type enzyme. CD spectra in near UV and fluorescence emission spectra of the N116H/N220G mutant suggest a small conformational change in the protein tertiary structure (not shown). The stability of the N220G mutant with urea as denaturating agent is similar to that of the WT enzyme. Transitions between native and denaturated states occurred near 3 m urea. The N116H/N220G mutant is a little less stable than the WT enzyme and the N220G mutant, because the transition already occurred between 2 and 3 m urea. The enzymes were stored in 15 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and in the presence of a free zinc concentration lower than 0.4 μm. Under these conditions, the N220G and N116H/N220G proteins contained one zinc ion per molecule as reported for the WT β-lactamase (Table III). At a free zinc concentration of 100 μm, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy results show that the WT enzyme and the N116H/N220G double mutant bind 2 zinc ions per molecule, whereas the N220G mutant binds 1.7 zinc ions per molecule. The activity of the two mutants was measured in the absence of added Zn2+ (<0.4 μm) with various substrates representing the three major families of β-lactam antibiotics, namely carbapenems, penicillins, and cephalosporins (Table IV). The N116H substitution (16.Vanhove M. Zakhem M. Devreese B. Franceschini N. Anne C. Bebrone C. Amicosante G. Rossolini G.M. Van Beeumen J. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2501-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) modified the activity profile of CphA. The mutant was 20-fold less active against imipenem, but the kcat values for benzylpenicillin, cephaloridine, and nitrocefin, although significantly increased, remained quite low so that imipenem remained the best substrate by two orders of magnitude or more.Table IVKinetic parameters of the WT, N116H, N220G, and N116H/N220G CphA enzymesEnzymeSubstratekcatKmkcat/Kms-1μmm-1 s-1WTImipenem12003403,500,000Benzylpenicillin0.03870aMeasured as Ki values.35Oxacillin>1>2,000500Ampicillin<0.012,500aMeasured as Ki values.<4Nitrocefin0.0081,3006Cephaloridine<0.0066,000aMeasured as Ki values.<1Cefotaxime>0.0002>1002N116HImipenem1501,400110,000Benzylpenicillin0.4910440Nitrocefin0.09332,700Cephaloridine0.24950250N220GImipenem390507,800,000Benzylpenicillin0.06530aMeasured as Ki values.120Nitrocefin0.00840020Cephaloridine0.035,500aMeasured as Ki values.5.5Cefotaxime0.0091,000aMeasured as Ki values.9N116H/N220GImipenem16 (8)185 (170)86,000 (47,000)Benzylpenicillin3.3 (20)150aMeasured as Ki values.

Open table in a new tab The behavior of N220G CphA is not very different from that of the wild-type enzyme (Table IV). By contrast, the substrate profile of the N116H/N220G mutant is completely different. It no longer behaves as a strict carbapenemase. It hydrolyzes benzylpenicillin, oxacillin, ampicillin, nitrocefin, cephaloridine, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime, in addition to imipenem. When compared with the WT enzyme, the kcat value of the latter decreased by 75-fold, but for all the other substrates, the Km values decreased and the kcat values increased (Table IV). Moreover, the N116H/N220G mutant efficiently catalyzes the hydrolysis of meropenem, biapenem, CENTA, cephalothin, cefaclor, and ceftriaxone (Table V).Table VInitial rates of hydrolysis for the N116H/N220G and some β-lactam antibioticsAntibioticsv0μmol min-1 mg-1Imipenem6.8Biapenem1.2Meropenem4Benzylpenicillin1.6Nitrocefin0.8CENTA0.6Cephalothin1.4Ceftriaxone0.4Cefaclor0.4 Open table in a new tab As mentioned before, the mono-zinc form of the wild-type enzyme (observed in the presence of contaminating zinc concentration, i.e. ∼0.4 μm) is active, and added zinc behaves as a non-competitive inhibitor resulting in negligible activity at high Zn2+ concentrations with a Ki (KD2) value of 46 μm (6.Hernandez-Valladares M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). With imipenem, the behavior of N220G was similar to that of the WT, but the KD2 value increased to 86 ± 6 μm (see Fig. 2B). By contrast, and despite a decrease of KD2 to 5 ± 0.9 μm, the double mutant retained 50% of activity at saturating Zn2+ concentrations (Fig. 1C). In both cases, the addition of Zn2+ did not affect the Km values (Table VI). With the other substrates, and as already observed with the N116H mutant, the activity of the N116H/N220G double mutant increased up to 14-fold in the presence of added zinc (Fig. 1, D–G). Analysis of the experimental curves using Equation 2 yielded values of 3 ± 0.24, 9 ± 1.8, 7 ± 1, and 9 ± 1 μm for the dissociation constant of the second zinc ion with nitrocefin, benzylpenicillin, cephaloridine, and cefotaxime as substrates, respectively.Table VIInfluence of zinc concentrations on kcat and Km values for N116H/N220G and imipenem[Zinc]kcatKmμms-1μmImipenem<0.416185114.4190512.51901010.4160209170508.71601008.516010008170 Open table in a new tab In these cases too, only kcat was affected, Km being unaffected (Table VII). This behavior was also observed for N220G, at least for nitrocefin (the activities of this enzyme against benzylpenicillin, cephaloridine, and cefotaxime were too low to allow meaningful measurements), and KD2 obtained from this curve using Equation 2 was 110 ± 13 μm (Fig. 2B).Table VIIInfluence of zinc concentrations on kcat and Km values for N116H/N220G and nitrocefin, benzylpenicillin, cephaloridine, and cefotaximeAntibioticsZinckcatKmμms-1μmNitrocefin<0.40.6942.51.36351.523.5101.793502.003.41002.063.7Benzylpenicillin<0.43.3015010020150Cephaloridine<0.40.9014510011145Cefotaxime<0.40.3050100450 Open table in a new tab From a B2 to B3 enzyme—Only the R121H and N116H/R121H/N220G mutants could be produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity in sufficient quantities. Masses were 25169 Da for R121H and 25136 Da for N116H/R121H/N220G, in agreement with the theoretical values (Table III). The far-UV CD spectra of the mutants are similar to that of the wild-type. The near-UV CD and fluorescence emission spectra of these mutants indicated small conformational modifications in the tertiary structure. The stabilities of the mutants in the presence of increasing concentrations of urea were a little lower than that of the WT. Transitions between native and denaturated states already occurred between 2 and 3 m. The activity of these two mutants was measured with imipenem, benzylpenicillin, nitrocefin, cephaloridine, and cefotaxime as substrates in the absence of added zinc, i.e. for a free zinc concentration below 0.4 μm (Table VIII). Under these conditions, a significant proportion of a di-zinc form was already present for both mutants, respectively, 60% for R121H and 40% for N116H/R121H/N220G, in contrast to the wild-type protein and to the N220G and N116H/N220G mutants, which were 100% mono-zinc under the same conditions (Table III). With imipenem, the R121H mutant was much less active than the wild-type, a loss of activity due to a 300-fold decrease of the kcat value. The Km value of benzylpenicillin significantly increased, whereas those of nitrocefin and cephaloridine decreased. The kcat/Km values increased significantly only for nitrocefin and cephaloridine but did so for different reasons, namely a decrease of Km for the former and an increase of kcat for the latter. The triple mutant exhibited a strong decrease of activity versus imipenem (due to a decrease of kcat) and, as for the N116H/N220G mutant, a significant increase versus all other substrates due to increased kcat values and, in the cases of nitrocefin and cephaloridine, significantly decreased Km values. However, in all cases, the kcat/Km values of the triple mutant remained well below those of N116H/N220G.Table VIIIKinetic parameters of the R121H and N116H/R121H/N220G mutantsEnzymeSubstratekcatKmkcat/Kms-1μmm-1 s-1WTImipenem1,2003403,500,000Benzylpenicillin0.03870aMeasured as Ki values.35Nitrocefin0.0081 3006Cephaloridine<0.0066,000aMeasured as Ki values.<1Cefotaxime>0.0002> 1002R121HImipenem3.63809,500Benzylpenicillin0.1111,000aMeasured as Ki values.10Nitrocefin0.00310300Cephaloridine0.031,800aMeasured as Ki values.17Cefotaxime0.0017245aMeasured as Ki values.7N116H/R121H/N220GImipenem1.4 (16)63 (185)22,000 (86,000)Benzylpenicillin0.35 (3.3)1,500aMeasured as Ki values.

Considering that in the absence of added zinc ([Zn2+] < 0.4 μm), 60% of the R121H enzyme is already in a di-zinc form, KD2 can be estimated to be below 1.0 μm. The activity of R121H with nitrocefin as substrate is independent of the zinc concentration (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, the activity of the N116H/R121H/N220G mutant with imipenem and nitrocefin as substrates increased (1.9- and 2.5-fold, respectively) in the presence of added zinc (Fig. 2, B and D). Considering that, in the absence of added zinc ([Zn2+] < 0.4 μm), 40% of the N116H/R121H/N220G enzyme was already in a di-zinc form, KD2 can be estimated to be below 1.0 μm. From a B2 to B1 Metallo-β-lactamase—On the basis of sequence alignments, the B2 characteristic motif of CphA has been modified to mimic that found in broad spectrum B1 enzymes. The N116H mutant has already been studied by Vanhove et al. (16.Vanhove M. Zakhem M. Devreese B. Franceschini N. Anne C. Bebrone C. Amicosante G. Rossolini G.M. Van Beeumen J. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2501-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, Asn220 was replaced by a glycine residue, and the N116H/N220G double mutant was constructed. Although the kcat/Km values of the N220G mutant were somewhat increased with benzylpenicillin, nitrocefin, cephaloridine, and cefotaxime when compared with the WT protein, its activity versus imipenem also slightly increased. These results indicate that the Asn220 side chain does not have a significant role in the catalytic process and does not influence the residues involved in this process. The mutation results in a higher KD2 value for the binding of the second zinc ion (Table IX). Titration of the apoenzyme 2K. De Vriendt, unpublished observation. of N220G by Zn2+ also indicates that binding of the second zinc ion is more difficult than with the WT enzyme. The three-dimensional structure of the mono-zinc N220G mutant shows that the increased backbone mobility due to the N220G mutation alters the ability of Cys221 to coordinate the zinc. As a consequence, the zinc ion occupies two sites, the wild-type site and a new site in which the zinc ion presents a tetrahedral geometry with the triad Asp120-Cys221-His263, the fourth ligand being Arg121 (7.Garau G.

In contrast, with nitrocefin as substrate, the di-zinc form of N220G is more active than the mono-zinc form, whereas there is no influence of added zinc on the activity of the WT enzyme versus nitrocefin. The N116H/N220G double mutant was not as active as the wild-type enzyme against imipenem, but several penicillins and cephalosporins were now found to be significantly hydrolyzed. Thus, recreating the characteristic motif of the B1 subclass clearly broadens the substrate profile. For this mutant, the kcat/Km values for benzylpenicillin, cephaloridine, and cefotaxime are of the same order as, or are only 1 order of magnitude lower than the kcat/Km value for imipenem, compared with 4–6 orders for the WT. The kcat/Km value for nitrocefin is even 2-fold higher, and this increases to 11-fold in the presence of added zinc (see below). With N116H/N220G and as already observed for N116H (16.Vanhove M. Zakhem M. Devreese B. Franceschini N. Anne C. Bebrone C. Amicosante G. Rossolini G.M. Van Beeumen J. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2501-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the di-zinc form is more active against benzylpenicillin, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, and nitrocefin than the mono-zinc form, contrary to what happens for imipenem. This suggests that imipenem on the one hand, and these latter compounds on the other, are hydrolyzed via slightly different mechanisms. However, the hydrolysis of imipenem by the N116H/N220G mutant is not totally inhibited by the binding of the second zinc ion, which underscores a significant residual activity of the di-zinc form with this substrate. For the latter, the kcat/Km values for benzylpenicillin, nitrocefin, cephaloridine, and cefotaxime are of the same order as, or are 1 order of magnitude higher than the kcat/Km value for imipenem (Table IV), and the kcat/Km values for all the tested substrates are of the same order of magnitude as, or are only 1 order lower than those determined for the subclass B1 BcII enzyme (5.Felici A. Amicosante G. Oratore A. Strom R. Ledent P. Joris B. Fanuel L. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which is considered to exhibit a broad activity spectrum. In the N116H/N220G mutant, the affinity for the second metal ion (characterized by KD2) increased by 5- to 10-fold suggesting that the His116 side chain can interact with the zinc ion. This hypothesis was already proposed for the N116H mutant by Vanhove et al. (16.Vanhove M. Zakhem M. Devreese B. Franceschini N. Anne C. Bebrone C. Amicosante G. Rossolini G.M. Van Beeumen J. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2501-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) but must be confirmed by NMR and perturbed angular correlation experiments and by resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the N116H and N116H/N220G mutants. Unfortunately, no suitable crystals have been obtained yet. With both mutants, the zinc concentration did not modify the Km values, but kcat decreased for imipenem or increased for the other substrates. Such a “non-competitive” inhibition or activation suggests that the substrate does not modify the affinity for the second zinc, and vice versa. Accordingly, the KD2 values measured on the basis of the activation or inhibition curves were similar within the limits of experimental errors: 86 and 110 μm for N220G, and 3–9 μm for N116H/N220G (Table VIII). From a B2 to a B3 Metallo-β-lactamase—The Arg121 residue is conserved in the BcII and CphA enzymes. Dal Peraro et al. (23.Dal Peraro M. Vila A.J. Carloni P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown by quantum chemistry calculations that, in the mono-zinc form of BcII, Arg121 anchors the Asp120 side chain by forming a strong ionic bond, ultimately orienting the Zn(II)-bound hydroxide for nucleophilic attack of the antibiotic β-lactam ring. Moreover, Rasia et al. (24.Rasia R.M. Ceolin M. Vila A.J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have shown that the R121H mutation in BcII leads to poor positioning of Asp120, and thus the kcat values of this mutant are lower than those of WT BcII. Our kinetic results are consistent with a similar role for the Arg121 residue in CphA, because the kcat value for imipenem is strongly decreased with R121H. A similar conclusion can be reached by comparing the kinetic parameters of the triple mutant to those of N116H/N220G. The kcat values are decreased as in the R121H mutant of BcII. However, the triple mutant, which is much less active than N116H/N220G, conserved a relatively broad substrate spectrum with significant hydrolysis rates of benzylpenicillin and cephalosporins. Moreover, it was the only mutant for which the binding of the second zinc increased the activity versus imipenem. Unfortunately, it was not possible to construct proteins more similar to the B3 enzymes, because the mutants with the additional C221S mutation could not be produced or were too unstable to allow detailed studies. The mutants exhibit another characteristic of B3 enzymes, namely a strongly increased affinity for the second Zn2+ ion. Indeed, the KD2 value decreased to below 1 μm. Thus, the replacement of the positive Arg121 side chain by a neutral one enhances the affinity for Zn2+, as was also suggested for BcII (8.Carfi A. Duée E. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have shown that the R121H mutation increases the affinity for the second Zn2+ ion in BcII and that the H121 side chain replaces His263 as a ligand of the second Zn2+. In contrast, the R121C mutation does not increase the affinity for the second Zn2+ in BcII (26.Rasia R.M. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1853-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the C121R mutant of CcrA was isolated in the di-zinc form, although the removal of the second zinc appeared to be facilitated (27.Fast W. Wang Z. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All these data and our results indicate that the replacement of Arg121 by a neutral residue in CcrA, IMP-1, and the sub-class B3 enzymes increases the affinity for the second zinc. Indeed, no mono-Zn2+ form of sub-class B3 enzymes has ever been obtained. Starting with the narrow spectrum A. hydrophila B2 β-lactamase, we have obtained, after introducing two mutations, an enzyme with a much broader activity spectrum. The ratio between the kcat/Km for different antibiotics and imipenem calculated for different class B β-lactamases and the CphA mutants underscores the complete modification of the CphA activity. As the subclass B1 and B3 enzymes, the N116H/N220G mutant is able to hydrolyze with a similar efficiency carbapenems, penicillins, and cephalosporins (Table X).Table XValues of (kcat/Km antibiotic)/(kcat/Km imipenem) for the CphA WT, N116/N220G, and N116H/R121H/N220G CphA mutants, subclass B1 (BcII, IMP-1, and VIM-2), and subclass B3 (L1 and FEZ-1) enzymesAntibioticskcat/Km (antibiotic)/kcat/Km (imipenem)CphA (Subclass B2)Subclass B1Subclass B3WTN116H/N220G [Zn] ≥ 0.4 μmN116H/N220G [Zn] = 100 μmN116H/R121H/N220GBcIIIMP-1VIM-2L1FEZ-1Benzylpenicillin<0.0010.232.50.013.750.510.270.55Cephaloridin<0.0010.071.40.040.1620.70.130.08Cefotaxime<0.0010.071.50.0460.31.5312 Open table in a new tab"

Two different DP subunits (DP-1 and DP-2) exist in humans. In this study, we identified two novel DP-1 isoforms (DP-1α and DP-1β) and characterized their structure and function. DP-1α is composed of 278 amino acids and lacks a portion of the C-terminal heterodimerization domain, whereas DP-1β is composed of 357 amino acids with a frameshift that causes truncation of the C-terminal domain. Yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that DP-1α binding to E2F1 was significantly reduced as compared with that of wild-type DP-1 or DP-1β. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the subcellular localization of both DP-1 isoforms changed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in HEK 293 cells cotransfected with E2F1 and wild-type DP-1 or DP-1β. However, such a translocation for DP-1α was barely observed. Reverse transcription-PCR results showed that the three DP-1 isoforms are expressed ubiquitously at equal levels in several normal human tissues. We also demonstrated the expression of these isoforms at the protein level by Western blotting. Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in transcriptional activity, a marked delay of cell cycle progression, and an inhibition of cell proliferation in DP-1α-transfected HEK 293 cells.

All E2F/DP family proteins contain two highly conserved domains: the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain. E2F exhibits strong transcriptional activity when it forms a heterodimer with DP protein. E2F1 was initially identified as a cellular factor required for the transactivation of the adenovirus E2 promoter by the E1A oncoprotein (11Kovesdi I Reichel R. Nevins J.R.

Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Yamasaki L. Development. 2003; 130: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) demonstrated that targeted inactivation of the Dp-1 locus in mice causes severe abnormalities during development of extra-embryonic tissue, which leads to embryonic lethality. This suggests an important role for DP-1 in morphogenesis. Therefore, it is of interest to identify any DP-1 isoform(s) as well as their precise functional roles. Although DP-2 has been known to have several isoforms that result from tissue-specific alternative splicing and that produce proteins that are 55, 48, and 43 kDa in size (17Zhang Y. Chellappan S.P.

In this study, we explored whether there are additional isoform(s) of human DP-1. We identified herein two novel human DP-1 isoforms, termed DP-1α and DP-1β, and characterized their structures and functions. We also investigated the interaction between the DP-1 isoforms and E2F1, as well as their transcriptional activity and role during cell cycle progression. We suggest that DP-1α, a novel isoform, acts as a dominant-negative regulator of cell cycle progression.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of DP-1 and Its Isoforms—Full-length DP-1 and isoform cDNAs were amplified by PCR using specific primers (forward, 5′-ATGGCAAAAGATGCCGGTCTAATTG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCAGTCGTCCTCGTCATTCTCGTTG-3′) and Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Japan) from a human testis cDNA library (BD Biosciences). The PCR conditions were as follows: preincubation at 98 °C for 20 s, 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 20 s, annealing at 70 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, and fragments were extracted from the agarose gel using the QIAEX II kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The extracted fragments were amplified by PCR using specific primers. EcoRI and ApaI restriction enzyme sites were incorporated into the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR products were electrophoresed and extracted under the same conditions. The extracted fragments were digested with EcoRI and ApaI and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector.Construction of Plasmids—Wild-type DP-1 and its isoforms were amplified by PCR with primers containing EcoRI and SalI or XhoI sites. PCR fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI-SalI site of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), pGBT9 (BD Biosciences), and pEGFP-C2 (BD Biosciences) or the EcoRI-XhoI site of pcDNA3-6xMyc. E2F1 was amplified as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX4T-1, pGAD10 (BD Biosciences). Alternatively, E2F1 was cloned into the BglII-EcoRI site of pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences). p3xFLAG-CMV7.1-E2F1 was constructed by isolating the HindIII-EcoRI fragment and cloning the fragment into the HindIII-EcoRI site of p3xFLAG-CMV7.1 (Sigma). All cDNAs were generated with Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara) by using DNA isolated from a human testis cDNA library (BD Biosciences). All PCR products were verified by sequencing. 6xE2F-Luc and dominant-negative (dn) DP-1 have been described elsewhere (23Yamada M. Kondo T. Ashizawa S. Takebayashi T. Higashi H. Hatakeyama M. Cytokine. 2002; 17: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney fibroblast 293 (HEK 293) and HeLa cells were grown to 30–50% confluency in 100-mm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Trace, Melbourne, Australia), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For luciferase assays, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid DNAs by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. In other experiments, Polyfect (Qiagen) was used for plasmid DNA transfection.Expression of DP-1 and Its Isoforms in Human Tissues—To detect expression of DP-1 isoforms, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; dn, dominant-negative; Luc, luciferase; WT, wild type; PBS (–), PBS (Mg2+- and Ca2+-free). was performed with the Access RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI). Total RNA was isolated using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) from several human cell lines. Total RNA (0.1 μg) was reverse-transcribed in reaction mixture (50 μl) with 10 pmol of the following isoform-specific primers: wild-type, β (reverse1, 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAGTCGTCCTCGTCATTCTCGTTG-3′) and DP-1α (reverse2, 5′-CATTGGAGATGCGTCG-3′) for 45 min at 48 °C. Three microliters of this reaction mixture were subjected to PCR after addition of Ex Taq (Takara) PCR mixture. PCR amplification was performed in a final volume of 20 μl with 20 pmol of the following gene-specific primers: wild-type, β (forward1, 5′-ACTGAATTCATGGCAAAAGATGCCGGTCTAATTG-3′; reverse1, 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAGTCGTCCTCGTCATTCTCGTTG-3′) and DP-1α (forward1, 5′-ACTGAATTCATGGCAAAAGATGCCGGTCTAATTG-3′; reverse2′, 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAAATTTGTCATTGGAGATGCGTCG-3′). To detect the expression of DP-1 isoforms in human normal tissues, we used the multiple tissue cDNA panels (BD Biosciences). The PCR conditions were as follows: preincubation at 96 °C for 20 s followed by 22 cycles of denaturation at 96 °C for 20 s, annealing at 70 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. Five microliters of the PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel.Immunoprecipitations—HEK 293 cells were harvested and washed two times with PBS (–) at 24 h following transfection of FLAG and Myc tag-fused expression vectors by Polyfect (Qiagen). The transfected cells were lysed in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Proteins in the cell lysate were precipitated with anti-FLAG M2-Agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed five times with TNE buffer and were then eluted by 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma). Supernatants were suspended in 2xSDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 200 mm dithiothreitol) and boiled for 2 min at 95 °C. Equal quantities of protein extracts of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting.Western Blotting—Cellular proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to Immobilon membrane (Nihon Millipore, Tokyo, Japan) by transfer blot (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h and washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 buffer. FLAG- or Myc-tagged DP-1 isoforms and E2F1 proteins were detected using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma, 1:1,000 dilution) or mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000, Dako Japan, Kyoto, Japan). The ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Hyperfilm was exposed for 15 s to 10 min. Western blot assays were performed as described previously (24Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).Endogenouse DP-1 isoforms were detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-DP-1 antibody (1:1,000, sc-610, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and alkaline phosphatase goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science, 1:200 dilution) in detection buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl) was used for detection. Hyperfilm was exposed for 4 min. Western blot assays were performed as described previously (24Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—pGBT9-DP-1s and pGAD10-E2F1 were transformed into the yeast strains AH109 or Y187, respectively. Transformed AH109 and Y187 were fused in synthetic dropout nutrient medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine and containing 2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco, Detroit, MI) overnight at 30 °C. Subsequently, cells were plated onto synthetic dropout nutrient plates containing the same components as well as 1.5% agar and X-α-gal (BD Biosciences) and cultured for 3 days at 30 °C. Yeast α-galactosidase assays were carried out in fused cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK 293 cells were transfected with GFP- or YFP-fused expression constructs. Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in DMEM with 10% FBS, washed three times with PBS (–), and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS (–), and coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Berkochen, Germany). GFP or YFP fusion proteins were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Luciferase Assay—HEK 293 cells were transfected with 200 ng of reporter construct (195 ng 6xE2F-Luc reporter plasmid and 5 ng of pRL-tk-Luc internal control plasmid), 100 ng of pcDNA3-6xMyc-DP-1s, and 100 ng of p3xFLAG-CMV7.1-E2F1. The total amount of vector DNA was kept constant by balancing with the empty expression plasmid. The transfected cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were detected with the TR717 microplate luminometer (Tropix) using the Dual luciferase reporter system (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed essentially as described previously (23Yamada M. Kondo T. Ashizawa S. Takebayashi T. Higashi H. Hatakeyama M. Cytokine. 2002; 17: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 24Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate.Flow Cytometric Analysis—To analyze the cell cycle, HEK 293 cells were grown in a 10-cm dish with 10% FBS containing DMEM until the cells formed a subconfluent monolayer. Cells were then transfected with 10 μg of the indicated expression constructs by Polyfect as described previously (24Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle distribution by a modification of a described procedure (25Shenker B.J. Hoffmaster R.H. Zekavat A. Yamaguchi N. Lally E.T. Demuth D.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, after a 24-h incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS (–) and fixed for 2 h with cold 70% ethanol. After washing twice with PBS (–), cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml containing 0.25 mg/ml RNase) for 30 min. Samples were passed through a nylon mesh (Kyoshin Riko, Tokyo, Japan) with a pore size of 40 μm and then analyzed on an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Inc.). Propidium iodide fluorescence was measured with a 620/15-nm band pass filter using linear amplification. A minimum of 5,000 events were collected per sample. Cell cycle analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc., San Carlos, CA).Measurement of Cell Proliferation—The HEK 293 cells transfected with the indicated expression constructs were cultured for 48 h in 10% FBS containing DMEM in the presence of Geneticin (1 mg/ml, Invitrogen). Cells (1 × 104 cells) were then selected with the drug via inoculation into each well of 24-well type culture dishes and cultured in 10% FBS containing DMEM in the presence of Geneticin. Cell numbers were measured at the selected times. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. calculated from triplicate cultures.RESULTSCloning and Structure of DP-1 Isoforms—To date, two Dp genes, Dp-1 and Dp-2, have been identified. Although a previous study (22Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D. Milla M.M. Phillips R.S. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7594-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) identified a DP-2 isoform, no DP-1 isoforms have yet been isolated. Since DP-1 effectively dimerizes with E2F1 and plays an important role as a transcription factor during cell cycling (26Bandara L.R. Buck V.M. Zamanian M. Johnston L.H. La Thangue N.B.

Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), our interest was to identify any DP-1 isoforms and to characterize their gene structure and function. To this end, we isolated cDNA clones of DP-1 from a human testis cDNA library and were able to identify two novel DP-1 isoforms in addition to the original wild-type DP-1. We named these isoforms DP-1α and DP-1β. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, DNA sequence analysis indicated that DP-1α has four nucleotides deleted in the PstI site. Consequently, the DP-1α isoform is composed of 278 amino acids, as compared with the 410 amino acids that comprise full-length DP-1, and lacks a portion of the C-terminal domain required for heterodimerization with E2Fs. We also analyzed the DNA sequence of the DP-1β isoform and confirmed that exon 11 is deleted and that exons 10 and 12 are spliced together. These data show that DP-1β is presumably generated by alternative splicing from canonical DP-1 pre-mRNA and, consequently, is composed of 357 amino acids with a frameshift that causes truncation of the C-terminal domain.Expression Profiles of DP-1 Isoforms in Various Human Tissues and Cell Lines—We analyzed mRNA expression of the DP-1 isoforms in a wide variety of human tissues and cell lines by RT-PCR. Expression of all three DP-1 isoforms was ubiquitously detected at the same level in all of the tissues and cell lines tested (Fig. 2, B–E). Using Western blotting, we analyzed expression of DP-1 isoforms at the protein level in HEK 293, KB, THP-1, and HL-60 cells and detected three endogenous DP-1 isoforms with molecular masses corresponding to 49 (WT), 33 (DP-1α (α)), and 42 (DP-1β (β)) kDa in all cell lines tested (Fig. 2F, lanes 1–4). Interestingly, the expression levels of DP-1 α protein appeared to be considerably higher in THP-1 and HL-60 cells (Fig. 2F, lanes 3 and 4).Fig. 2Expression profile of DP-1 isoforms in normal human tissues and established cell lines. A, diagram showing the positions of the specific primers used to analyze expression of DP-1 isoforms in normal human tissues and established cell lines. Also shown are RT-PCR profiles of wild-type DP-1 and DP-1β expression in normal tissues (B) and cell lines (C) as well as DP-1α expression in normal tissues (D) and cell lines (E). F, endogenous DP-1 isoforms in total cell lysates were detected by Western blotting with anti-DP-1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interaction between DP-1 Isoforms and E2F1—Since DP-1 is known to interact with E2F1 via its heterodimerization domain, we used yeast two-hybrid screening and immunoprecipitation to assess the interaction between each new DP-1 isoform and E2F1. In our two-hybrid experiments, we observed that although no α-galactosidase activity was detected in AH105 yeast cotransfected with DP-1α and E2F1 expression vectors, strong α-galactosidase activity at the same level as that of wild-type DP-1 was detected when AH105 yeast was cotransfected with DP-1β and E2F1 (Fig. 2A). Next, we used immunoprecipitation to confirm the results of the yeast two-hybrid experiments. As shown in Fig. 3B, no interaction was detected between DP-1α and E2F1, although DP-1β appeared to interact with E2F1 as strongly as wild-type DP-1. The interaction between DP-1α and E2F1 may depend on the lack of a heterodimerization domain in this isoform. These results suggest the possibility that DP-1α may act as a dominant-negative regulator of DP-1.Fig. 3Interaction between DP-1 isoforms and E2F1. A, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” α-Galactosidase activity was measured in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 cotransformed with combinations of empty vector (pGAD10; left (L); pGBT9, 1), DP-1 isoforms (WT, 2; α, 3; β, 4), and E2F1 (pGAD10; right (R)). B, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with combinations of empty vector, DP-1 isoforms (pcDNA3-6xMyc), and E2F1 (p3xFLAG-CMV-7.1), and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. The presence of DP-1 isoforms in the immunoprecipitates (IP) was detected by Western blotting (WB) using anti-Myc antibody. The presence of E2F1 and DP-1 isoforms in cell lysates was detected by Western blotting using anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibody as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Localization of DP-1 Isoforms and E2F1 in HEK 293 Cells— Next, we used confocal imaging to observe the subcellular localization of the unbound DP-1 isoforms, the E2F1 monomer, and the DP-1/E2F1 heterodimers in HEK 293 cells transfected with GFP- or YFP-fused expression vectors. When each DP-1 isoform and E2F1 was expressed in cells transfected with GFP- or YFP-fused expression vector alone, we observed that all DP-1 proteins were predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm. In contrast, E2F1 was strongly expressed in the nuclei of the cells (Fig. 4A, upper panel). In cells cotransfected with YFP-E2F1 and GFP-DP-1WT or -DP-1β, we clearly observed that these DP-1 isoforms localize to the nuclei in all cell lines tested. Interestingly, we also observed that DP-1α is almost completely localized to the cytoplasm, even when both GFP-DP-1α and YFP-E2F1 are coexpressed (Fig. 4A, lower panel). These results suggest that this phenomenon is due to DP-1α lacking a heterodimerization domain.Fig. 4Immunofluorescence analysis of the localization of DP-1 isoforms and E2F1 in HEK 293 cells. HEK 293 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C2 (A) or pYFP-C1 empty vector (B) and with E2F1-fused pYFP-C1 (C). Cells were also transfected with wild-type DP-1 (D), DP-1α (E), DP-1β (F), or dnDP-1 (G) fused to pEGFP-C2. In addition, cells were cotransfected with combinations of GFP-DP-1WT- (H), DP-1α- (I), DP-1β- (J), or dnDP-1- (K) fused pEGFP-C2 and YFP-E2F-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transcriptional Activity in HEK 293 Cells Transfected with DP-1 Isoforms—Since E2F/DP-1 is a key transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation, we used a luciferase assay to measure the transcriptional activity of DP-1 isoforms in HEK 293 cells cotransfected with a combination of DP-1 expression vectors and a reporter luciferase construct (6xE2F-Luc). As shown in Fig. 5, marked transcriptional activity was observed in cells transfected with pcDNA3/DP-1WT and DP-1β. However, when cells were transfected with pcDNA3/DP-1α, we observed a significant decrease in transcriptional activity. In addition, we observed that transcriptional activity is completely inhibited in dnDP-1-transfected cells. These results suggested that DP-1α may act as a negative regulator of the transcription factor E2F/DP-1.Fig. 5Transcriptional activity of DP-1 isoform-transfected HEK 293 cells. HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids as indicated. Cotransfected cells were cultured for 24 h, and luciferase activity was measured.

As shown in Fig. 6, each DP-1 isoform was transfected into HEK 293 cells, and cell cycle progression of the transfected or control cells was analyzed 24 h later. We observed a significant increase of the G2/M cell population in wild-type DP-1-transfected cells (Fig. 6C). However, the G2/M cell population in DP-1α-transfected cells was dramatically decreased (Fig. 6D). In contrast, no significant effects were observed in DP-1β-transfected cells (Fig. 6E). These results demonstrated that DP-1α regulates the cell cycle in a dominant-negative manner.Fig. 6DNA histograms of DP-1 isoform-transfected HEK 293 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2036766540,"Nitrophorin 2 (NP2) is a salivary lipocalin from Rhodnius prolixus that binds with coagulation factors IX (fIX) and IXa (fIXa). Binding of NP2 with fIXa results in potent inhibition of the intrinsic factor Xase complex. A panel of site-directed surface mutants of NP2 was generated to locate determinants of high affinity fIX(a) binding. The locations of the mutations were based on comparisons with the related, but less potent, inhibitor nitrophorin 3 (NP3). Three point mutants (K21A, K92A, and V94A) were found that clearly reduced the inhibitory potency as measured by the activity of a reconstituted factor Xase system. Binding of NP2 with fIXa and fIX as measured by surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry was reduced in a similar manner. Of the three mutants, two (K92A and V94A) were located on the loop connecting β-strands E and F of the lipocalin β-barrel. The largest changes were seen with the K92A mutation, which lies at the apex of the loop, with a smaller effect being seen with mutation of Val94. Combination of four E-F loop mutations (K92A, A93K, V94A, E97A) in a single mutant reduced the inhibitory potency and binding to levels similar to those seen with NP3 without affecting heme or histamine binding.

The intrinsic factor Xase complex (fXase) 1The abbreviations used are: fX, factor X; fIX, factor IX; fVIII factor VIII; NP, nitrophorin; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. 1The abbreviations used are: fX, factor X; fIX, factor IX; fVIII factor VIII; NP, nitrophorin; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. is an essential component of the mammalian blood coagulation cascade consisting of factors IXa (fIXa), VIIIa (fVIIIa), and X (fX) assembled on an anionic phospholipid surface (1Jenny N.S. Mann K.G. Loscalzo J. Schafer A.I. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. 2nd Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1998: 3-27Google Scholar). Disruption of this reaction results in two of the most important human bleeding disorders, hemophilias A (fVIII deficiency) and B (fIX deficiency) (1Jenny N.S. Mann K.G. Loscalzo J. Schafer A.I. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. 2nd Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1998: 3-27Google Scholar). Nitrophorin 2 (NP2) is a salivary anticoagulant protein from the blood-feeding insect Rhodnius prolixus that targets the intrinsic fXase complex (2Ribeiro J.M.C. Schneider M. Guimaraes J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Sun J. Yamaguchi M. Yuda M. Miura K. Takeya H. Hirai M. Matsuoka H. Ando K. Watanabe T. Suzuki K. Chinzei Y. Thromb. Heamostasis. 1996; 75: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is a hyperbolic mixed-type inhibitor that acts by interfering with assembly of the proteolytic complex and/or phospholipid binding (4Zhang Y. Ribeiro J.M. Guimaraes J.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10681-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). NP2 does not inhibit the amidolytic activity of fIXa but rather blocks fXa formation in reactions lacking either phospholipid vesicles or fVIIIa (4Zhang Y. Ribeiro J.M. Guimaraes J.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10681-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Factor X activation is not inhibited in the absence of fVIIIa and phospholipid suggesting that interactions between fX and fIXa are not directly influenced by NP2, while those between fIXa and fVIIIa/phospholipid are (4Zhang Y. Ribeiro J.M. Guimaraes J.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10681-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, direct binding of NP2 with fIX and fIXa has been shown using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), while in the same study, no interaction of NP2 with fVIII was seen (5Isawa H. Yuda M. Yoneda K. Chinzei Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6636-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Binding with fIX also results in inhibition of fIXa generation by both fXIa and the tissue factor-fVIIa complex (5Isawa H. Yuda M. Yoneda K. Chinzei Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6636-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Removal of the Gla (γ-carboxyglutamic acid-rich) domain of fIX was found to eliminate the SPR interaction, suggesting that the NP2 binding site is located at or near this region, a primary point of interaction between fIXa and the phospholipid surface (5Isawa H.

NPs are heme proteins that carry a molecule of nitric oxide from the salivary gland to the host circulation where it serves as a vasodilator and platelet aggregation inhibitor (7Ribeiro J.M.C.

Ribeiro J.M.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6987-6994Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additionally, NPs bind histamine with high affinity, making them anti-inflammatory agents as well (8Ribeiro J.M.C. Walker F.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2251-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). NP2 is unique among members of the group in being a potent coagulation inhibitor. NP3, the closest relative of NP2, has recently been shown to have weak anticoagulant activity while the remaining two well characterized NPs, NP1 and NP4, show no effect on clotting (12Andersen J.F. Montfort W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30496-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).We have previously described the crystal structure of NP2 and compared it with those of NP4 and NP1 (12Andersen J.F. Montfort W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30496-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Binding of histamine and NO occurs via coordination with heme iron, but the anticoagulant effect is independent of heme binding and appears to involve an exterior binding surface (2Ribeiro J.M.C. Schneider M. Guimaraes J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Differences in the molecular surfaces between NP1, NP4, and NP2 suggested that fIXa binding by NP2 may be related to exposure of a portion of the eight-stranded β-barrel consisting of parts of strands B, C, D, and E due to a shortened C terminus relative to NP1 and NP4 (12Andersen J.F. Montfort W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30496-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The less potent NP3 shares 80% sequence identity with NP2, and like NP2, its C-terminal is shortened, but the two molecules differ at a number of surface-exposed amino acid positions. In this study we have used structural information from NP2 as well as sequence comparisons between NP2 and NP3 to design a panel of site-directed mutants to locate a major determinant of high affinity fIXa binding by this unusual and potentially important inhibitor of the intrinsic coagulation pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Coagulation factors IXa and X were obtained from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT) or Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Recombinant factor VIII was obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT) or as the therapeutic agent Advate from Baxter Healthcare (Westlake Village, CA). The chromogenic substrate S-2222 was obtained from Diapharma (Columbus, OH), and phospholipids were obtained from Sigma. The Quick Change site directed mutagenesis system was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).Mutagenesis Procedure and Preparation of Wild-type and Mutant Protein—Site-directed mutants of NP2 were generated either by a PCR-based procedure or with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system. The DNA sequences of all mutants were verified. Mutated cDNAs were ligated into the expression vector pET17b and the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was used for expression. Proteins were obtained as inclusion bodies that were washed, solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, and refolded as described previously (9Andersen J.F.

After refolding, the proteins were reconstituted with heme and purified by a combination of gel filtration and cation exchange chromatography as described previously (9Andersen J.F. Ding X.D.

Purified NPs were evaluated for purity and quantified by SDS-PAGE and UV-visible spectrophotometry.Assay of the Intrinsic fIXase—Phospholipid vesicles were generated by injecting a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (3/1 in chloroform) into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 70 °C to a final concentration of 1 mm (11Andersen J.F.

Phys. Lipids. 1996; 84: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nitrogen was bubbled through the buffer during and for 10 min after injection. The vesicles were incubated at 70 °C for 1 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature before use.Enzymatic reactions were carried out in a final volume of 0.1 ml in 96-well microtiter plates. The reaction buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 μm phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (3:1) vesicles. Recombinant fVIII was added to a final concentration of 15 units/ml and activated by adding thrombin (0.1 unit/ml), followed by incubation for 3 min at room temperature. After fVIII activation NPs were added to various concentrations followed by addition of fIXa to a concentration of 0.25 nm. The reaction was started by adding fX to a concentration of 150 nm and then incubated for 4 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to a concentration of 5 mm. fXa generation was determined by adding the substrate S-2222 in water directly to the wells to a final concentration of 180 μm. Absorbance changes at 405 nm were measured at 25 °C using a ThermoMax kinetic plate reader.Surface Plasmon Resonance—SPR measurements were made with a Biacore 3000 instrument at 25 °C. Factor IXa dissolved in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 was immobilized by passing over an activated CM5 chip at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. For measurement of binding, NP2 and its mutants were dissolved in Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2. All data were collected using a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The kinetic data were fitted to a two-state model including an induced fit-type conformational change (Scheme 1).The Biacore evaluation software was used to obtain the rate constants k1, k-1, k2, and k-2 by simultaneous global fitting to the rate equations, d[fIXa]/dt=k1[NP][fIXa]−k−1[fIXa-NP*](Eq. 1) d[fIXa-NP*]/dt=(k1[fIXa][NP]−k−1[fIXa-NP*])−(k2[fIXa][NP*]−k−2[fIXa-NP])(Eq. 2) d[fIXa-NP]/dt=k2[fIXa-NP*]−k−2[fIXa−NP](Eq. 3) where [fIXaNP*] represents the concentration of the encounter complex, and [fIXa-NP] represents concentration of the complex after stabilization by a conformational change. The dissociation constants for the two reaction steps (Kd1 and Kd2) and the overall dissociation constant (Kdo) were calculated as follows (15Lipschultz C.A. Yili L. Smith-Gill S. Methods (Duluth). 2000; 20: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Kd1=k−1/k1(Eq. 4) Kd2=k−2/K2(Eq. 5) Kdo=(Kd1Kd2)/(Kd2+1)(Eq. 6) Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Titrations measuring either histamine binding with various NPs or NP binding with fIXa were performed using a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter at 30 °C. The proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl for histamine binding experiments. For measurement of NP2 interaction with fIXa, 2 mm CaCl2 was added to the dialysis buffer. Histamine was dissolved in the buffer used for dialysis of the NP. In the case of histamine binding, wild-type NP2 or NP2 mutants were added to the cell, while histamine was delivered in 10-μl injections. In fIXa studies, the coagulation factor was added to the cell, while NP was delivered in 5-10 μl injections. Heats of dilution were subtracted from the data, and the net enthalpies were fitted to a single-site binding model using the Microcal-Origin software.RESULTSMutagenesis Strategy—Candidate residues for site-directed mutagenesis of NP2 were identified by a two-step procedure. An alignment of NP2 and NP3 was created, and non-conserved amino acid positions were identified (Fig. 1). The NP2 crystal structure (Protein Data Bank designation 1EUO) was then examined to find non-conserved residues having surface-exposed side chains. The set of non-conserved residues showing surface exposure in the crystallographic model was chosen for mutagenesis (Fig. 1). In most cases the residues were mutated to alanine, but in the case of residues 60, 93, and 142, the NP2 residue was mutated to the corresponding residue in NP3.Fig. 1Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences of NP2, NP3, and NP4 with positions of NP2 mutations indicated by shading. Mutations in loop E-F are shaded in blue, while all others are shaded in yellow. The nature of the mutation is indicated above the mutated position.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)General Characterization of Point Mutants—All of the NP2 mutants tested here produced absorbance spectra similar to ligand-free and ligand-bound forms of wild-type protein (Fig. 2, A-D) with Soret absorbances near 403 nm for the ligand-free proteins and at 410 nm for the histamine complexes. Histamine affinity measurements were made only for those mutants showing significantly reduced inhibitory activity in the fXase assay. The binding enthalpy for histamine was highly favorable, presumably due to coordination of the imidazole portion of histamine with ferric iron, as well as the formation of salt bridge and hydrogen bond interactions of protein side chains with the aliphatic amino group of histamine seen in published crystal structures of NP1 and NP4 (Fig. 2, E and F). The histamine dissociation constants for the mutant and wild-type proteins were nearly identical and were similar to published values obtained by spectrophotometric methods (9Andersen J.F. Ding X.D.

Taken together, the absorbance spectra and calorimetric data of the mutants indicate that the proteins are properly folded.Fig. 2Characterization of NP2 site-directed mutants.

Chinzei Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6636-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For NP3 the IC50 was 1.7 μm, ∼170-fold larger than that seen with NP2, and only partial inhibition was achievable (Fig. 4A).Fig. 3Inhibition of factor Xase complex by wild-type NPs and site-directed mutants of NP2.

Mutants K92A and V94A were clearly less potent than the others, while K21A was only slightly less active than the wild-type protein (Figs. 3 and 4, A and B). Mutants Lys92 and Val94 lie on the loop connecting strands E and F (E-F loop) of the eight-stranded lipocalin β-barrel (12Andersen J.F. Montfort W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30496-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), indicating that this loop is an important determinant for formation of a high affinity complex.The point mutant K92A showed the largest loss of inhibitory potency, with the IC50 value increasing ∼35-fold over the wild-type (Fig. 4A), followed by V94A, which produced a ∼4-fold increase in the IC50 (Fig. 4B). The K21A mutant showed a small but detectable reduction in inhibition with an IC50 values ∼2-fold larger than wild-type, respectively. Interestingly, the A93K mutation, lying between Lys92 and Val94 on the E-F loop, had no detectable effect on inhibition (Fig. 3), but the E97A mutant showed a slight decrease in potency (Fig. 3). When the K92A, A93K, V94A, and E97A mutations were combined into a single quadruple mutant construct (QUAD), the loss of potency was larger than any single point mutant, with an increase in the IC50 of ∼160-fold (Figs. 3 and 4A). The QUAD mutant was similar in potency to NP3 (Fig. 4A), and as with NP3, only partial inhibition was achievable.SPR Analysis Suggests a Two-state Binding Model—We observed multiphasic kinetics for both association and dissociation reactions of NP2 with immobilized fIXa. The kinetic behavior was not affected by changes in ligand loading or flow rate, suggesting that mass transfer effects were not responsible. An experiment was performed in which the contact time of an analyte (K92A mutant) was varied at a single concentration. The observed reduction in amplitude of the fast release phase (k-1) with increasing contact time (Fig. 5C) was not consistent with a parallel reaction scheme (17Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and suggested that a two-state model (Scheme 1) would best describe the data. In this model, the inhibitor forms an encounter complex with fIXa (fIXa-NP*), which is then stabilized (fIXa-NP) through a conformational change via an induced fit-type mechanism. Examples of global fits to the two-state model for the K92A and V94A mutants are shown in Fig. 5, A and B.Fig. 5Surface plasmon resonance measurements of NP binding with fIXa. A, global fitting to two-state binding model of data for K92A mutant (0.5 and 1.0 μm). Solid line, experimental data; dashed line, global fit.

Binding of NP3 with fIXa was detectable but substantially lower than that for NP2. The reduced affinity for NP3 was due primarily to an elevation in the dissociation rate constant for the encounter complex (k-1, Table I) of ∼16-fold, shown most clearly in the normalized ligand release curves of Fig. 5D. A smaller reduction in k2 of ∼4-fold was also seen indicating a slower rate of stabilization of the encounter complex. Together, these factors resulted in a difference in the overall dissociation constant of ∼75-fold (Table I, Fig. 6A).Fig. 6Surface plasmon resonance measurements of binding with fIX and fIXa.

Open table in a new tab Binding of NP2 Mutants with fIXa—The four mutants (positions 92, 94, 97, and 21) showing reduced activity in fXase inhibition assays also showed reduced binding with immobilized fIXa in SPR experiments. As in the enzymatic assays, the largest effect was seen with mutation of K92 which lies at the apex of the E-F loop. The magnitude of the binding effects became smaller as the mutation site was moved along the loop toward β-strand F.The K92A mutant strongly affected the stability of the encounter complex. (Table I, Fig. 6B). A large increase in k-1 was seen, as was a decrease in k1 (Table I) resulting in a decrease in the overall affinity of ∼ 25-fold. However, k2 was not dramatically reduced relative to NP2, suggesting that the encounter complex was stabilized in a manner similar to the wild-type protein after it is was formed.Situated further from the E-F loop apex, the V94A mutation produced a smaller loss of potency than K92A in enzymatic inhibition assays and a correspondingly higher affinity for fIXa in SPR assays (Fig. 6B, Table I). Nevertheless, the affinity of V94A was reduced relative to NP2, showing a decrease in k1 but no large increase in k-1. Unlike K92A, V94A also had a negative effect on stabilization of the encounter complex (k2, Table I). Following the trend of diminishing effect with distance from the loop apex, the E97A mutant showed a small but detectable decrease in binding relative to NP2 (Table I). Also, the small reduction of inhibitory potency in the K21A mutant was reflected in SPR results as a decrease in affinity of ∼5-fold (Table I).Combining of the loop E-F mutations in QUAD again produced a larger effect than any single point mutation. Mutations at positions 92, 93, 94, and 97 in a single construct produced a larger effect on fIXa binding than any single mutant (Fig. 6B, Table I). Relative to NP2, QUAD displayed a large increase in k-1 of ∼12-fold, presumably due largely to mutation of Lys92, as well as decreases in k1 and in k2 (Table I). These changes in the kinetic constants between NP2 and QUAD result in an increase in the overall dissociation constant of ∼100-fold (Table I).Binding of NPs with fIX—Binding of wild-type NP2, NP3, K92A, V94A, and QUAD with fIX was examined to determine whether any differences in affinity exist between the zymogen and mature protease. The kinetic values obtained by SPR were similar to those obtained for binding of the same proteins with fIXa (Table II, Fig. 6C). Again, the data were best analyzed using a two-state model. NP2 again bound with the highest affinity with V94A, K92A, NP3, and QUAD showing progressively weaker binding (Table II).Table IIKinetic analyses of binding of NPs with factor IX using the two-state binding model described in Scheme 1k1k−1k2k−2Kd1Kd2Kd0RmaxaMaximum NP binding capacity in resonance units (RU).r.m.s.d.bRoot mean square deviation of experimental data from the calculated model (RU).m−1 s−1 × 105s−1s−1 × 10−3s−1 × 10−3m × 10−8m × 10−8RURUWT3.90.0415.07.510.20.503.46823.1NP31.70.342.82.3200.0.8290.15871.6K92A1.50.1910.34.3127.0.4237.64962.3V94A0.90.023.44.922.21.4413.16012.2QUAD1.10.275.59.4245.1.71155.5801.2a Maximum NP binding capacity in resonance units (RU).b Root mean square deviation of experimental data from the calculated model (RU).

https://openalex.org/W2095022643,"Binding of thrombopoietin (TPO) to the cMpl receptor on human platelets potentiates aggregation induced by a number of agonists, including ADP. In this work, we found that TPO was able to restore ADP-induced platelet aggregation upon blockade of the Gq-coupled P2Y1 purinergic receptor but not upon inhibition of the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor. Moreover, TPO triggered platelet aggregation upon co-stimulation of Gz by epinephrine but not upon co-stimulation of Gq by the thromboxane analogue U46619. Platelet aggregation induced by TPO and Gi stimulation was biphasic, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors prevented the second but not the first phase. In contrast to ADP, TPO was unable to induce integrin αIIbβ3 activation, as evaluated by binding of both fibrinogen and PAC-1 monoclonal antibody. However, ADP-induced activation of integrin αIIbβ3 was blocked by antagonists of the Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor but was completely restored by the simultaneous co-stimulation of cMpl receptor by TPO. Inside-out activation of integrin αIIbβ3 induced by TPO and Gi stimulation occurred independently of thromboxane A2 production and was not mediated by protein kinase C, MAP kinases, or Rho-dependent kinase. Importantly, TPO and Gi activation of integrin αIIbβ3 was suppressed by wortmannin and Ly294002, suggesting a critical regulation by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. We found that TPO did not activate phospholipase C in human platelets and was unable to restore ADP-induced phospholipase C activation upon blockade of the Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor. TPO induced a rapid and sustained activation of the small GTPase Rap1B through a pathway dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In ADP-stimulated platelets, Rap1B activation was reduced, although not abolished, upon blockade of the P2Y1 receptor. However, accumulation of GTP-bound Rap1B in platelets activated by co-stimulation of cMpl and P2Y12 receptor was identical to that induced by the simultaneous ligation of P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptor by ADP. These results indicate that TPO can integrate Gi, but not Gq, stimulation and can efficiently support integrin αIIbβ3 activation platelet aggregation by an alternative signaling pathway independent of phospholipase C but involving the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the small GTPase Rap1B.

Despite this, TPO is unable to promote platelet functional responses, such as secretion or aggregation, in the majority of healthy subjects. However, TPO has the intriguing ability to potentiate platelet aggregation induced by a variety of stimuli, including thrombin, ADP, and collagen (5Ezumi Y. Takayama H. Okuma M.

For instance, ADP-induced platelet aggregation requires the co-activation of both Gq-coupled P2Y1 and Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptors (23Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The P2Y1 receptor induces activation of phospholipase (PLC) β, leading to calcium mobilization and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and is required for shape change and initiation of aggregation (24Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2030-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 25Jantzen H.M. Gousset L. Bhaskar V. Vincent D. Tai A. Reynolds E.E.

Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The P2Y12 receptor, which is classically associated with the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase through Gαi, is responsible for the amplification of platelet response and completion of platelet aggregation (24Jin J.

This effect is possibly mediated by the G-protein βγ dimers-mediated activation of PI-3K and the small GTPase Rap1B (28Kauffenstein G. Bergmeier W. Eckly A. Ohlmann P. Leon C. Cazenave J.P.

Other agonists, such as the thromboxane A2 (TxA2), the receptors of which are coupled exclusively to Gq to stimulate PLCβ, are able to induce aggregation as long as secreted ADP can stimulate the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor (32Paul B.Z. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 33Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, replacement of Gq-dependent activation of PLCβ by stimulation of PLCγ2 through tyrosine kinase-based pathways, such as in the case of Fcγ receptor IIA (FcγRIIA) clustering or glycoprotein VI stimulation, can still result in platelet aggregation providing that a Gi-dependent pathway is concomitantly stimulated (34Gratacap M.P.

Finally, the requirement of Gq stimulation to induce platelet aggregation can be bypassed by treatment with PKC activators (36Pulcinelli F.M. Ciampa M.T. Favilla M. Pignatelli P. Riondino S. Gazzaniga P.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In conclusion, it may be assumed that concomitant stimulation of PLC and activation of Gi are critical to support agonist-induced platelet aggregation.In this work, we investigated the possible ability of TPO to integrate Gq- or Gi-dependent pathways for platelet activation. We found that platelet aggregation may be triggered by concomitant activation of cMpl receptor and Gi- but not Gq-coupled receptors. Aggregation in response to TPO and Gi stimulation occurs in the absence of PLC activation and is sustained by inside-out activation of integrin αIIbβ3. Therefore, stimulation of cMpl receptor can bypass the need for PLC activation and efficiently integrate Gi-dependent signaling to trigger full platelet aggregation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sepharose CL-2B, GSH-Sepharose, [32P]orthophosphate, and the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate were from Amersham Biosciences.

The cDNA for the Rap binding domain of RalGDS (RBD) was kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Bos (University of Utrecht, The Netherlands).Platelet Preparation—Blood was drawn from healthy volunteers who abstained from drugs for at least 2 weeks. When PRP was used for platelet aggregation, 1:10 sodium citrate (3.8%) or hirudin (500 units/ml) was added as anticoagulant. Conversely, to prepare gel-filtered platelets, blood was drawn in 1:10 ACD (152 mm sodium citrate, 130 mm citric acid, 112 mm glucose) as anticoagulant. PRP was prepared by centrifugation of whole blood at 120 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Platelets were then recovered by centrifugation of the PRP at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in a small volume (0.5 ml) of autologous plasma. Platelets were isolated by gel filtration on a 10-ml column of Sepharose CL-2B and eluted with HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4). Platelet count was typically adjusted to 0.3 × 109 cells/ml unless otherwise stated. For 32P labeling, the platelet suspension (109 cells/ml) was incubated with 0.2 mCi/ml 32P for 90 min at 37 °C and then centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min in the presence of 2 mm EDTA. 32P-labeled platelets were resuspended in HEPES buffer and used at the final concentration of 0.5 × 109 platelets/ml.Measurements of Platelet Aggregation—Samples of PRP (0.4 ml) were prewarmed at 37 °C in an aggregometer under constant stirring, incubated with buffer or increasing concentrations of TPO for 3 min, and then stimulated with 2 μm ADP, 1 μm U46619, or 1 μm epinephrine. Aggregation was monitored for at least 5 min. When indicated, AR-C69931MX (1 μm) or MRS2179 (200 μm) was added 2 min before stimulation. Treatment with 1 mm aspirin or 10 μm indomethacin was performed for 30 min before stimulation. The baseline was set using platelet-poor plasma obtained by centrifugation of a small volume of PRP at 500 × g for 20 min.Rap1B Activation Assay—Activation of Rap1B was evaluated essentially as described previously (29Lova P.

Active Rap1B was identified by immunoblotting with a specific polyclonal antibody and quantified by densitometric scanning. In parallel, the total amount of Rap1B in the whole cell lysate was also analyzed by immunoblotting.Measurement of Cytosolic Ca2+ Concentration—Platelets were prepared essentially as described above with slight modifications. PRP was incubated with 3 μm FURA-2-AM at 37 °C for 30 min before further processing. Platelets were then isolated by gel filtration and eluted with HEPES buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 5.5 mm glucose. Platelet count was then adjusted to 2 × 108 cells/ml. Measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ was performed on 0.4-ml samples prewarmed at 37 °C under gentle stirring in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS3 spectrofluorimeter in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. The fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 510 nm, respectively. FURA-2 fluorescence signals were calibrated according to the method of Pollock et al. (38Pollock W.K. Rink T.J. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All determinations were repeated at least three times with platelets from different donors.Measurement of Pleckstrin Phosphorylation—Samples of 32P-labeled platelets (0.1 ml) treated with buffer or MRS2179 (200 μm) were stimulated with 10 μm ADP, 100 ng/ml TPO, or 1 unit/ml thrombin for the times indicated in Fig. 4. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 4% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue), and samples were heated for 5 min at 96 °C. Aliquots of total platelet proteins (20 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 5–15% acrylamide gradient gel followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gels were then dried, and phosphorylation of pleckstrin was evaluated upon autoradiography for about 18 h at –80 °C. Alternatively, PKC-dependent protein phosphorylation was evaluated by immunoblotting using an anti phospho-(Ser) PKC substrate antibody. Unlabeled platelet samples (0.1 ml, 0.3 × 109 platelets/ml) were incubated at 37 °C and stimulated for 1 min with 10 μm ADP and/or 100 ng/ml TPO. When indicated, 200 μm MRS2179 was added 2 min before stimulation. Platelets were lysed in 2% SDS in HEPES buffer, and protein concentration was determined. Aliquots containing 50 μg of total platelet lysates were heated at 96 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, separated on a 5–15% acrylamide gradient gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with anti-phospho-(Ser) PKC substrate antibody diluted 1:1,000. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction.Analysis of Fibrinogen and PAC-1 Fab Binding to Human Platelets— Platelets were isolated from PRP by centrifugation at 300 × g in the presence of 1 μm prostaglandin E1 and 1 unit/ml apyrase. Pellets were washed with 15 ml of PIPES buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.5) and then centrifuged in the presence of 1 unit/ml apyrase. Finally, platelets were gently resuspended in HEPES buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5.5 mm glucose at the final concentration of 2 × 107/ml. Platelet samples (50 μl) were incubated with 200 μg/ml biotin-fibrinogen and 10 μg/ml phycoerythrin-streptavidin in the absence or presence of 200 μm MRS2179 and then treated with 10 μm ADP and/or 100 ng/ml TPO for 30 min at room temperature without stirring. For PAC-1 binding, platelet samples (50 μl, 0.5 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated with 1 μg/ml PAC-1 Fab antibody and 10 μg/ml goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with fluorescein and then treated with agonists, as described for fibrinogen binding. When indicated, platelets were preincubated with selected inhibitors as follow: 1 mm aspirin, 10 μm indomethacin, 30 μm BAPTA-AM for 30 min; 20 μm SB203580, 10 μm PD98059, 20 μm Y27632, 25 μm Ly294002, 100 nm wortmannin, 20 μm PP2 for 15 min; 10 μm Ro318220 for 5 min. When appropriate, platelets were treated with a corresponding volume of Me2SO, used as solvent for many of the inhibitors analyzed, as a control. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.95 ml of 0.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and samples were placed in the dark. To assess nonspecific binding, parallel samples were incubated with 1 mm RGDS. Fibrinogen and PAC-1 Fab binding to platelets was quantified by flow cytometry.RESULTSThrombopoietin and Gi Stimulation Induce Activation of Integrin αIIbβ3 and Platelet Aggregation—TPO potentiates platelet aggregation induced by low doses of different agonists, including ADP (5Ezumi Y. Takayama H. Okuma M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Kojima H. Hamazaki Y. Nagata Y. Todokoro K. Nagasawa T. Abe T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1541-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Rodriguez-Linares B. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that the reversible aggregation induced by 2 μm ADP is progressively converted into full irreversible aggregation by increasing concentrations of TPO. The potentiating effect of TPO is already detectable at 50 ng/ml and is maximal at higher concentrations (200 ng/ml). Aggregation induced by ADP requires the concomitant activation of the Gq-coupled P2Y1 and the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptors (23Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We investigated whether co-stimulation of the two purinergic receptors by ADP was also strictly necessary for TPO-induced potentiation of platelet aggregation. When the P2Y1 receptor was blocked by the specific antagonist MRS2179, ADP-induced aggregation was prevented but could be restored by the addition of TPO in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, a residual shape change persisted in ADP-stimulated platelets in PRP despite the presence of MRS2179. Although we have not performed an accurate analysis to try to explain this event, we may exclude that this is due to an inefficient inhibition of P2Y1 receptor as we have observed a complete suppression of PLC activation under the same experimental conditions (see Figs. 3 and 4, and data not shown). By contrast, when the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor was blocked, platelets did not undergo aggregation in response to ADP even in the presence of a high concentration of TPO (200 ng/ml) (Fig. 1C). Identical results were also obtained using gel-filtered platelets stimulated with 10 μm ADP in the presence of exogenous fibrinogen (data not shown). Moreover, upon blockade of the P2Y1 receptor, platelet aggregation profiles very similar to those reported in Fig. 1B were recorded when ADP and TPO were added simultaneously or when treatment with ADP preceded the addition of TPO (data not shown), indicating that the observed effects are independent of the order of agonists addition. These findings suggest that TPO can replace stimulation of Gq, but not of Gi, to induce platelet aggregation. To confirm our results, we analyzed epinephrine-induced aggregation. Binding of epinephrine to α2A-adrenergic receptor (which is coupled to Gz, a member of the Gi family) is unable to induce platelet aggregation in hirudin-treated PRP. However, concomitant stimulation of α2A-adrenergic receptor by epinephrine and cMpl receptor by TPO resulted in a full platelet aggregation (Fig. 1D). By contrast, selective stimulation of the Gq-coupled receptor for the TxA2 (pursued by the addition of the stable analogue U46619 in the presence of the P2Y12 receptor antagonist AR-C69931MX) did not result in platelet aggregation, either in the absence or in the presence of a high concentration of TPO (Fig. 1E). Platelet aggregation induced by a combination of TPO- and Gi-dependent signaling constantly showed a biphasic pattern, suggesting a possible contribution of secondary messengers such as TxA2. We therefore investigated the ability of TPO to restore ADP-induced aggregation upon blockade of the P2Y1 receptor in aspirin- or indomethacin-treated platelets. Fig. 1F shows that the inhibitors of cyclooxygenase prevented the second, but not the first, phase of platelet aggregation induced by co-stimulation of P2Y12 and cMpl receptors. Therefore, the rapid, initial phase of platelet aggregation is independent of TxA2 generation. Although potentiation of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was evident at concentrations of TPO as low as 25 ng/ml (Figs. 1B and 1D), further studies had been performed with higher doses of TPO (typically 100 ng/ml) to better reveal and to more reliably detect even weakly activated signaling events.Fig. 1Platelet aggregation induced by TPO and Gi stimulation. Platelet aggregation was measured in a lumiaggregometer using platelets in PRP stimulated with 2 μm ADP (A–C and F), 1 μm epinephrine (D), or 1 μm U46619 (E). PRP was typically collected in sodium citrate, except for the experiments with epinephrine, in which hirudin was used. Platelets were preincubated with 200 μm P2Y1 receptor antagonist MRS2179 (B and F) or with 1 μm P2Y12 antagonist AR-C69931MX (C and E) for 1 min before stimulation. In F, platelets were incubated with 1 mm aspirin (ASA) or 10 μm indomethacin (Indo) for 30 min before stimulation. TPO (0, 25, 50, 100, or 200 ng/ml, as indicated on the right of each trace) was added 3 min before ADP. In C, E, and F, TPO was used at 200 ng/ml.

https://openalex.org/W1999722691,"All the available antiherpetic drugs are directed against viral proteins. Their extensive clinical use has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains. There is a need for the treatment of herpes infections due to resistant strains, especially for immunocompromised patients. To design new kinds of drugs, we have developed a strategy to identify cellular targets. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection is concomitant to a repression of most host protein synthesis. However, some cellular proteins continue to be efficiently synthesized. We speculated that some of them could determine the outcome of infection. Since two polyamines, spermidine and spermine, are components of the HSV-1 virions, we investigated whether enzymes involved in their synthesis could be required for viral infection. We show that inhibition of S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase, a key enzyme of the polyamine metabolic pathway, prevents HSV-1 infection. Inhibition of polyamine synthesis prevents infection of culture cells with HSV-1 laboratory strains as well as clinical isolates that are resistant to the conventional antiviral drugs acyclovir and foscarnet. Our data provide the opportunity to develop molecules with a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of herpes infection."

Here we report the identification of a multifunctional domain (MFD) of CREST that is involved in transcription transactivation, nuclear body targeting, and dimerization. MFD is located near the C terminus of CREST from amino acid 251 to 322 and is required and sufficient for CREST homodimerization. When fused with a GAL4 DNA-binding domain, MFD was effective in transcription transactivation of a luciferase reporter system. A C-terminal 339–401 amino acid sequence of CREST was shown to contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which was able to direct a yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) to nucleus. A CREST deletion mutant containing both the MFD and NLS, which spanned the C-terminal amino acid sequence 251–401, was able to target YFP to the nucleus and nuclear bodies. However, MFD alone failed to target YFP and was largely cytosolic. The addition of a SV40 NLS to MFD domain restored nuclear body targeting.

When YFP-MFD was expressed in cultured rat embryonic cortical neurons, it was effective in inhibiting depolarization-induced dendritic growth, suggesting that CREST dimerization may be necessary for its function in neuronal dendritic development. The calcium-responsive transactivator (CREST) 1The abbreviations used are: CREST, calcium-responsive transactivator; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; MFD, multi-functional domain; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HEK, human embryonic kidney; S, sedimentation coefficient; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; syt, synorial sarcoma translocation. has been shown to be required for activity-dependent dendritic development in neurons (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Mutant mice lacking CREST had a marked decrease in dendritic growth and branching, whereas axonal growth was largely unaffected (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that CREST is highly homologous to the SYT proto-oncogene that is involved in synovial sarcoma with 54% amino acid identity (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Ladanyi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5755-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). CREST is composed of three main functional domains: a N-terminal region that has been suggested to play an auto-regulatory role, an internal methionine-rich domain with unknown functions, and a large C-terminal glutamine-rich domain responsible for transactivation (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical localization showed that CREST is a nuclear protein (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Moreover, CREST was found in nuclear body structures in the rat pheochromacytoma PC12 cells and when it was expressed in various cell types (3Pradhan A. Liu Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 370: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A possible functional significance of CREST nuclear bodies is the recruitment of additional transcription activators/co-activators. Deletion analysis suggested that the nuclear body-targeting signal was localized to its C-terminal region of CREST (3Pradhan A. Liu Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 370: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). CREST has been shown to interact with cAMP-response element-binding protein and p300 (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and such interactions may be crucial for the Ca2+-dependent transactivation of CREST and its function in activity-dependent neuronal dendritic development. Activity-dependent gene transcription in the central nervous system is mediated by second messengers such as Ca2+ and cAMP (4Impey S. Smith D.M. Obrietan K. Donahue R. Wade C. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 5Gorbunova Y.V. Spitzer N.C. Nature. 2002; 418: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). For instance, the transcription factor CREB binds to the Ca2+- and cAMP-responsive element CRE and is shown to play an essential role in synapse formation and memory storage (7Kandel E.R. Biosci. Rep. 2001; 21: 565-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 8Pham T.A. Rubenstein J.L. Silva A.J. Storm D.R. Stryker M.P.

In the current study, we have identified a domain that is involved in CREST transactivation, nuclear body targeting, and homodimerization. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that this domain was able to inhibit neuronal dendritic growth in cultured neurons, suggesting that CREST dimerization is necessary for its function. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The FLAG-(Δ251–322) CREST was generated by PCR. A point mutation at 751 bp was engineered, and full-length FLAG CREST was used as the template. Primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-CTCTTCCCAGCGGTACCTGGGCCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGCCCAGGTACCGCTGGGAAGAG-3′. Boldface letters in the primers denote the site for point mutation where the nucleotide A is replaced by a G at 751 bp. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzyme KpnI, which cuts at the point mutation site and at 966 bp. The 211-bp sequence was deleted, and the remaining clone was religated to generate FLAG-(Δ251–322) CREST. YFP-C-(251–401) CREST was generated by a sequential PCR reaction. In the first step, the following primers were used: forward, 5′-CAGATCTCGAGCTCAAGCTTCCAGTACCTGGGCCAGGAGGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTACCGTCGACTGCAGAATTCTTATTGCTGGTAATTTCCATA-3′. Full-length Y-CREST was used as template. In the second step of the reaction, the PCR product from the first step was used as a primer mixture and the vector YFP-C2 was used as template. After 18 cycles, the PCR reaction was digested with DpnI for 1 h and 2 μl of the product was used to transform XL2 Blue Escherichia coli by electroporation. YFP-C-(322–401) and YFP-C-(251–322) were generated by PCR using the following primers: forward, 5′-GGGAAGCTTCCCAGCAGAGCTACCCCTGGACA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGGGAATTCTTACATGTTGATGTTGGTCCGAGA-3′, and forward, 5′-GGGGGTCGACAGTACCTGGGCCAGGAGGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTACCGTCGACTGCAGAATTCCTGGTACCCAGCCTGCTGCTG-3′, respectively, and full-length Y-CREST as template for both reactions. Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-CREST and YFP-CREST or a combination of FLAG-CREST with each of the YFP-CREST deletion constructs. 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Nonidet P-40. The lysate was incubated with protein G-agarose beads (Calbiochem) and 3.5 μg/μl monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibody or monoclonal anti-GFP (Sigma) antibody overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with PBS buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The following primary antibodies were used: the monoclonal anti-FLAG (2 μg/ml, M2); monoclonal anti-GFP (1:2,000); or goat anti-CREST (1:2,000). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse and anti-goat antibodies from Sigma were used. Luciferase Reporter Assay—pBIND vector (Promega) contains the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain upstream of a multiple cloning region. GAL4-CREST was generated by the digestion of full-length YFP-CREST with restriction enzymes BglII and SalI and subcloning into the pBIND vector at BamHI/SalI sites. GAL4-C251–322 was generated by cutting YFP-C-(251–322) with SalI and KpnI and subcloning in the pBIND vector at the same sites. For the reporter assay, PC12 cells were transfected with 1 μg each of either Gal4-CREST or GAL4-C251–322 with 1 μg of pG5 luciferase vector (Promega). The pG5luc vector contains five GAL4-binding sites upstream of a minimal TATA box, which in turn is upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. After 24 h, the media was changed and the cells were treated with 70 mm KCl. 48 h after transfection, the cells were collected in 1× cell culture lysis buffer. The samples were vortexed briefly and then centrifuged at room temperature for 30 s. 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) was added to the cell lysate and mixed, and the sample tube was placed in the luminometer (TD-20/20, Turner Designs) to initiate reading. Cell Cultures and Transfection—PC12 and HEK293 cells were cultured and transfected by polyethyleneimine and calcium phosphate method, respectively, as described previously (3Pradhan A. Liu Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 370: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Rat embryonic cortical neurons were cultured as described previously (10Liu Y.C. Chapman E.R. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1991; 6: 411-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cortices from day 17 embryos of Sprague-Dawley rat were dissected and dissociated by trituration. Cells were plated onto 35-mm culture dishes precoated with 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and cultured in neuro-basal media (Invitrogen) with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and N2 supplement (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured for 24 h before transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated with 8 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of Lipofectamine for 4 h in serum-free minimum Eagle's medium before replacing with the normal culture media. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with 56 mm KCl overnight. Transfected neurons were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Immunohistochemistry—The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Monoclonal anti-FLAG (10 μg/ml, M2) antibody was incubated with the cells at 4 °C overnight. Rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500) was from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). For the endogenous CREST staining in neurons, the neurons were fixed and permeabilized with 90% cold ethanol for 5 min. The cells were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Goat anti-CREST (1:2,000) antibody was incubated with the cells at 4 °C overnight. Rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:500) was used. To isolate the dendrites, the neurons were stained with monoclonal anti-MAP-2 antibody (1:1000, Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500) was used as secondary antibody. Analysis of Dendritic Length—For analysis of dendritic length, day 17 embryonic cortical cultures were transfected with a GFP expression vector and analyzed. Images of the transfected neurons were captured with a digital camera. All of the dendrites in each region of interest were manually traced, and the length was measured using IPLab 3.5 (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). For each experiment, at least 100 cells were measured. CREST Targeting Is Mediated by Its C-terminal Domain—We have previously shown that CREST is specifically targeted to nuclear bodies in a variety of cell types including HEK293, COS-7, PC12, and MCF-7 cells. A significant amount of CREST was detected in cultured rat embryonic neurons and neuronal-like PC12 cells (3Pradhan A. Liu Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 370: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Using a polyclonal goat-anti-CREST antibody, we were able to show that the CREST protein was primarily localized to the nucleus of cultured rat cortical neurons, as previously reported (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Under a ×100 objective, CREST nuclear bodies were clearly identifiable (Fig. 1), which is similar to the endogenous CREST localization in a PC12 cell line (3Pradhan A. Liu Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 370: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have previously located the nuclear body-targeting domain of CREST to the C-terminal 238–401 amino acid sequence (3Pradhan A. Liu Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 370: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To further define the nuclear body-targeting domain, we made several additional CREST mutants that were fused with the YFP. An internal deletion mutant, CREST-(Δ251–322), in which the amino acid sequence 251–322 of CREST was removed, failed to target to nuclear bodies (Fig. 2). Interestingly, CREST-(Δ251–322) was still targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 2A), suggesting that a nuclear localization signal for CREST exists outside the nuclear body-targeting domain. A search based on known NLS criteria did not yield any classical NLS in CREST. However, a deletion mutant C (251–401) was found to target YFP to nucleus and nuclear bodies (Fig. 2A). Removing amino acid residues 251–322 abolished nuclear body localization, whereas nuclear localization remained unaffected. These results suggest that the C-terminal 339–401 contained the NLS. Moreover, it indicates that nuclear import and nuclear body localization are closely coupled events. To test whether a nonspecific NLS could facilitate the nuclear body targeting, we fused a SV40 NLS to the N-terminal of C-(251–322). As shown in Fig. 2B, nearly all of YFP-NLS-C-(251–322) were targeted to the nucleus. Moreover, ∼45% showed nuclear body localization by the fusion protein. This suggested that the sequence from amino acids 251–322 contain the element that is needed for nuclear body localization, although the efficiency was reduced compared with the wild-type CREST. Dimerization of CREST—A majority of the endogenous CREST in rat brain existed as multimeric complexes when analyzed by ultracentrifugation sedimentation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, there were two distinct CREST species that were separated on a density gradient. A small fraction of CREST had an apparent sedimentation coefficient (S)of5,anda majority of CREST had a S value of ∼17. Because the endogenous CREST may have multiple binding partners, we transiently expressed CREST in HEK293 cells and performed chemical cross-linking of the exogenous proteins. As shown in Fig. 3B, a product with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa was detected, suggesting that CREST could exist as homodimers. To further investigate whether there is a minimal domain of the protein necessary for the dimerization, we determined the dimerization domain by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. CREST and CREST deletion mutants were fused to YFP and co-expressed with FLAG-tagged CREST or its mutants. As shown in Fig. 4, YFP-CREST was able to interact with FLAG-CREST and was co-immunoprecipitated. The deletion of the N-terminal 1–145 or C-terminal 322–401 amino acid sequences did not affect dimerization, whereas the removal of amino acid 189–401 abolished dimerization, suggesting that the dimerization domain was in the C terminus. An internal deletion mutant, CREST-(Δ251–322), in which the nuclear body-targeting domain was removed, failed to interact with the full-length CREST (Fig. 4B). However, amino acid sequence 251–401 containing the nuclear body targeting and NLS domains were fully functional in dimerization (Fig. 4B). To further dissect the dimerization domain, we co-expressed FLAG-CREST with YFP-C-(251–322) or YFP-C-(322–401) and performed co-immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4C, the FLAG-CREST was co-immunoprecipitated with YFP-C-(251–322). However, YFP-C-(339–401) did not interact with the FLAG-CREST (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the nuclear body-targeting domain was also responsible for the homodimerization of CREST. Transactivation activity of C-(251–322)—CREST has been shown to be a Ca2+-dependent transactivator by Ghosh and colleagues (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). When CREST was fused with a GAL4 DNA-binding domain, the fusion protein was able to activate transcription of a reporter gene under the control of GAL4 promoters in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Using similar strategies, it was shown previously that the CREST homolog SYT also activated transcription, although no attempts were made to determine its calcium dependence (11Thaete C. Brett D. Monaghan P. Whitehouse S. Rennie G. Rayner E. Cooper C.S. Goodwin G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have used the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells to assay CREST transactivation activities. Undifferentiated PC12 cells express l-type Ca2+ channels, and the cells have been extensively used for investigating neuronal functions such as differentiation and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (12Greene L.A. Aletta J.M. Rukenstein A. Green S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 147: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A high concentration of KCl leads to membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx in PC12 cells, which allows assaying for Ca2+-dependent transcription similar to that in cultured neurons. As shown in Fig. 5, GAL4-CREST fusion protein activated the transcription of luciferase from the GAL4 promoters that was enhanced by KCl treatment, which was in agreement with the previous results from cultured neurons (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ca2+-independent transcriptional activation was also prominent, similar to those previously reported for GAL4-SYT fusion protein (11Thaete C. Brett D. Monaghan P. Whitehouse S. Rennie G. Rayner E. Cooper C.S. Goodwin G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that, in addition to the Ca2+-dependent transactivation, CREST plays an important role in basal transcriptional activation in the absence of Ca2+ influx. The GAL4-C-(251–322) was also able to activate transcription of the luciferase reporter in a Ca2+-independent manner, and the activity was markedly higher compared with the wild-type CREST (Fig. 5). This was probably because of the removal of the putative N-terminal inhibitory domain. However, no enhancement was observed under KCl depolarization, and KCl treatment seemed to further depress transcription (Fig. 5). These results suggested that amino acid sequence 251–322 of CREST contained a basic transactivation domain, whereas the Ca2+-responsive domain lay in other parts of the molecule. Based on the results that the same 251–322 amino acid sequence was involved in CREST targeting, dimerization, and transactivation, we have named the domain multi-functional domain (MFD). The MFD Domain Inhibits Depolarization-induced Dendritic Growth in Culture Neurons—Cultured cortical neurons from rat embryos undergo differentiation that includes rapid axonal growth and a somewhat delayed and slower dendritic growth. After 4–5 days in vitro, most neurons have a single long axon and several short dendritic processes that can be distinguished with specific immunological markers such as MAP-2 (Fig. 6A) (15Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5807-5817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under depolarizing conditions, i.e. 56 mm KCl, which activates voltage-dependent calcium channels, the dendritic growth is accelerated, which results in a marked increase in total dendrite length and complexity (13Redmond L. Kashani A.H. Ghosh A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 999-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To determine the role of CREST dimerization in such activity-dependent dendritic growth/development, we transfected cultured cortical neurons from embryonic day 17 rats with YFP-MFD. The neurons were depolarized with KCl at 4–5 days in vitro, and their axonal and dendritic growth was examined by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 6, the expression of YFP-MFD effectively blocked KCl-induced dendritic growth compared with the control neurons expressing YFP. However, axonal growth did not seem to be affected. Because YFP-MFD resided largely in cytosolic compartments (Fig. 2), we asked whether it could still form a heterodimer with wild-type CREST and move to the nuclear compartment, especially the nuclear bodies. As shown in Fig. 6D, YFP-MFD became highly co-localized with FLAG-CREST in the nuclear bodies when the two proteins were co-expressed in HEK293 cells. These results suggested that YFP-MFD was able to dimerize with the wild-type CREST, probably in the cytosolic compartment, and then translocate to the nucleus. Furthermore, it suggested that the formation of CREST-YFP-MFD heterodimer interfered with depolarization-induced dendritic growth, probably as a result of reduction in the amount of CREST homodimers. Although the importance of CREST in activity-dependent dendritic tree growth during brain development is well established, the mechanisms underlying its function and how its activity is regulated remain unknown. Structural analysis suggests that the protein may have three major functional domains that include a N-terminal regulatory domain, an internal methionine-rich domain, and a C-terminal transactivation domain (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain originally characterized by Azaiwa et al. (2004) spans a large region from amino acid 238 to 401, which also contains a CREB-binding protein-binding site located within the last 9 amino acids (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that amino acid sequence 1–322 of CREST contains the nuclear body-targeting signal (3Pradhan A. Liu Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 370: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Now we have narrowed down the domain to 251–322 as essential for CREST nuclear body targeting. Moreover, we have shown that this is a multi-functional domain that is involved in transactivation, dimerization, and nuclear body targeting. However, it is unknown whether the domain can be further dissected structurally and functionally. Many transcriptional activators/co-activators contain glutamine-rich activation domains. Thus, it was not surprising that the transactivation domain of CREST resided within its C-terminal region that is rich in glutamine. Interestingly, the activation activity of the MFD was significantly higher than that of the wild-type CREST (Fig. 5). This is probably attributed to the absence of the N-terminal domain, which has been shown to inhibit CREST activity (1Aizawa H. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Balakrishnan K. Ince G. Gurevich I. Cowan M. Ghosh A. Science. 2004; 303: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, this domain failed to respond to KCl-induced membrane depolarization that markedly enhanced the transcriptional activation by wild-type CREST (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that MFD probably contains the basic and main transactivation domain of CREST, whereas the Ca2+-responsive domain lay outside the region. This C-terminal region is also highly homologous to the so-called QPGY domain of SYT, which is enriched with Glu, Pro, Gly, and Tyr residues and is shown to be responsible for transcriptional activation of SYT (2Ladanyi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5755-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 11Thaete C. Brett D. Monaghan P. Whitehouse S. Rennie G. Rayner E. Cooper C.S. Goodwin G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined whether the corresponding sequence of 251–322 in SYT is the transactivation domain. Moreover, there is a deletion of 30 amino acid residues from 282–312 in SYT and the functional implication of this region is unknown at present. Because of the high degree of homology between SYT and CREST, a comparative study between the two proteins should yield insightful information regarding their functions in neuronal and cancer development. Using several approaches, we have demonstrated that CREST could form a homodimer or oligomer when expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3). Dimerization of transcription factors and activators is a common phenomenon associated with the gene transcription process. For instance, transcription factors of the AP-1 family form homodimers or heterodimers that are crucial for transcriptional activation. By exploiting such properties, researchers have generated dominant c-Jun mutations that block its transcriptional activities in various cell types (14Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar). Using similar approaches, we have shown that YFP-MFD was able to act as a dominant negative mutant that inhibited depolarization-induced dendritic growth in cultured neurons (Fig. 6). Such a mutant should offer a useful tool for investigation into CREST function and its regulation during brain development. We thank Dario Andrade and Qiong Zhou for the excellent technical help and Eric Howard and Brian Ceresa for critical reading of the manuscript."
